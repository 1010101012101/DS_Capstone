If anything Rain serves to put The Beatles, a band we often take for granted, in its proper historical context. In a mere eight years they went from a pop music sensation with an impressive collection of catchy tunes to making the remarkable transition to one of the most innovative bands in music history with some songs that are still ahead of their time.

He used to take his family to Fort Point, on the San Francisco side of the Golden Gate, and tell them about the bridge and the work he had done. "He was always very proud of that," said Gayle Balestreri, his daughter.
As in the case of health insurance, a one-size-fits-all approach makes little sense. The cost of unemployment varies widely in terms of the time it takes to find another job. Currently, the average duration of unemployment is 40.9 weeks, almost three times what it was prior to the Great Recession. Paying the same standard six months of unemployment benefits in a poor labor market as a good one is as desirable as a health insurance policy that pays for the same number of days in a hospital for a heart transplant as it does for appendicitis.

In summer, a steam locomotive, the Jacobite, chugs up this part of the West Highland Railway, one of the last major lines built in Britain. It's one of the most scenic rail trips in Europe, featuring mirror-like lochs and muscular rock formations. A highlight for Kelly was traveling over the Glenfinnan Viaduct, a 21-arch railroad bridge that has appeared in several " Harry Potter" movies. It crosses Loch Shiel, the location of the fictional Hogwarts Lake. In Mallaig, the engineer parked the coaches at the station and locked the doors. We had four hours to walk down to the sea, climb to an overlook and then warm up in a pub with a meal of fresh haddock. This far north, the sun sets just before 4 p.m., and there was no sightseeing on the way back to Fort William and the four-hour trip onto Glasgow.

Leatherman ranks beaches using 50 different criteria from quality of sand to safety. Siesta Beach has been in the top 10 of his annual list for years. He praises the width of the beach as being hundreds of yards wide, attracting volleyball players and beachcombers. The waves are small and the beach slope is gentle. He also gives praise to its status as a nonsmoking beach. While he says the beach parking fills up on summer weekends, he cites the amenities including the bathrooms, snack bars, grills, picnic tables and shade trees as part of the reason why Siesta Beach is America's top beach.

Federal officials have long been keeping an eye on the Dodge City area, which has become a hub for drug trafficking in the Midwest because of its remote location and easy access to places like Denver, Kansas City and Oklahoma City. They say gangs have thrived in the area because police lacked resources, including Spanish-speaking officers, and gang members are able to easily blend into the growing Hispanic population.

Marketed under the name, Yervoy, the drug will become available in April. Bristol-Myers Squibb plans to charge $30,000 per dose, or $120,000 for a four-dose course of treatment, Bloomberg News reported. While that may seem outrageously expensive, it's comparable to many other biotechnology drugs for cancer in recent years and about what it costs to care for a patient with advanced melanoma using existing, less effective treatments.

While the Nakalele Point blowhole on Maui has come under recent scrutiny, the geographical phenomenon of surf spraying geyserlike through a hole in the lava rocks is not particularly common in Hawaii. Perhaps that's what make them so enticing to daredevil antics, such as diving into the large one at ﻿South Point on the Big Island. And at Spouting Horn on Kauai and Halona Cove on Oahu, fences have been installed to block access to the blowholes (which can be viewed from lookouts) and the dangerously surging waters and slippery rocks that create them. That doesn't stop imprudent types from bypassing these barriers, but it does make them less of a trouble spot for some.

Even though Dahlberg did not commit any wrongdoing, he was swept into the Watergate scandal as Midwest finance chairman of Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign. Dahlberg became linked to the scandal after a check he delivered to the Nixon campaign turned up in a Watergate burglar's bank account. The contribution was legal, and a grand jury cleared Dahlberg.

Obama's Buffett rule wouldn't clean up the tax code; in fact, it would add more complexity. It's a campaign talking point framed as an easily understandable appeal for equity, and one that also takes a swipe at Romney, who paid an effective tax rate of about 14 percent in 2010.
Starz is growing again, with 19 million paying households, and is working on services that will let viewers watch its movies and shows anywhere, much like the HBO2Go feature. Forget about being the next HBO, though.

Hill, all 5-11, 165 pounds of him, is a prototype cover corner.
Questionable Calls: It's surprising that the Titans didn't draft a center or guard to aid one of the league's most anemic rushing attacks in 2011. The club did sign veteran Steve Hutchinson in free agency, but it's unclear if the seven-time Pro Bowler can reclaim his once-dominant form after battling injuries. Tennessee had a need for a pass-rushing presence at defensive tackle, but Martin's not dynamic in that department.
Flagstone and gravel pathways among terraced rock planting beds with colorful flowers create a fenced, private backyard oasis behind this contemporary Claremont neighborhood home, built in 1941.

A: Yeah. Acting for me was the way in. It was either that or go to a film school and learn from a director who directed a Pepsi commercial in 1972 and listen to him talk about lighting setups for three months. Or, I can get on set and watch Gore Verbinski freaking draw out on a piece of paper the quickest and best lighting setups and then go, "This one, go do this right now." Whoa. I want to do that. Directing for me is like my endgame. I want to produce. I want to direct. I want to create my own content.

Not for the first time, Bieber has demonstrated good taste. "Call Me Maybe" is a perfect little pop confection. Everything about the record works: the wonderfully flirty lyrics, the cupcake-on-a-tray melody, the goofy disco beat and synthesized strings, even the Fisher-Price funk guitar that comes in midway through the chorus.
Helm plays a key role centering the third line and is usually in the first penalty-killing group. He's a relentless checker -- the Wings will need that, especially against Shea Weber and Ryan Suter. Helm is also the fastest guy on the team; so fleet-footed, teammates can't tell he's injured.
Under tremendous pressure to win, the young Blues responded. The Blues probably learned something about what it takes to win this time of year. They'll have to deal with blood, bruises, pain, frustration, adversity, horrible officiating and failure. There can be no retreat, no surrender.

Heaven forbid you fall back on your property taxes in Baltimore City and your home goes to the property tax sale! Not only will you pay 18 percent interest on the money, you will pay ever increasing legal fees, and the city will demand that you pay taxes that are not overdue.

Yuval evolves from a callow pest into a serious young poet to whom the Author imagines himself giving stern but useful advice.

In fact, Latinos rarely reveal them to Western doctors -- or even that they see a curandero -- for fear of ridicule. But whether Anglos give curanderos credence or not, the placebo effect cannot be underestimated.

Hey, Doug: First, congratulations on your season prediction. You may nail it. I was much more optimistic (7-9). Of course, I picked them to go 8-8 the year before this and watched them stumble to 5-11. On your draft scenarios, I suppose Richardson and Bufict are strong candidates. But I would say there are more issues to address than just dropped passes and run defense (quarterback, running game, right tackle, cornerback, safety, defensive end).

In 2001, L'Oreal proposed a $60 million expansion of the site that would have doubled its size, but the deal fell apart when it couldn't get zoning changes from Solon. (Editor's note: Solon city officials said L'Oreal requested variances on public safety ordinances, not zoning changes in the company's 2001 proposal. They further said that L'Oreal removed its request in 2002 but it did receive similar variances in 2007.)
I find it amazing that Dan Rodricks and others who support illegal immigrants always mix up legal and illegal aliens ("Immigrants: We detest them — and need them," June 30). An undocumented alien is an unlawful intruder into this country. Seasonal migrant workers on H-2B visas are documented workers and thus legal immigrants.

Pip is the nerdy but confident blue-eyed soul singer who dresses like someone begging to be beat up after school. He came to battle this week wearing a bow tie, suspenders and plaid pants. I like how the NBC website uses the "hipster" descriptor for someone whose style counselor would appear to be Larry King. The pair were given Amy Winehouse's "You Know That I'm No Good" and they did a lot better than no good. Christina's backhanded compliment to Pip sounded like she was dismissing him as a pop singer: "You almost come across as someone who has done Broadway before," which felt like she was saying, "You kinda remind me of Liza Minnelli."

Hiding under a metal desk with a gunshot wound in his ankle, Tennyson could hear bullets _ 300 rounds were later found _ smashing through the walls and into the filing cabinets next to the desk, and obliterating clocks, mirrors, and everything else that hung on the walls. During pauses in the shooting, he sat still and prayed he would see his wife and son again. He ripped the silver cross from a chain around his neck and gripped it in his hands. He knew that Arturo Reyes Torres, a fired Caltrans worker he knew slightly, was reloading.
Kobach calls himself an "adviser" to the Romney campaign. But recently, the campaign told Politico that the anti-illegal-immigration crusader is merely a "supporter." Kobach insists his role has not changed. Maybe not. Then what he should be worried about is why the Romney campaign wants people -- especially Hispanics -- to think otherwise.

Generally, there is no impediment for voters to choose whichever primary ballot they want. In past years, a voter wishing to change parties — such as a registered Democrat wishing to vote in the Republican primary — had to fill out a form pledging allegiance to the new party’s principles. But the form is no longer required unless the rare occasion arises in which an election official has “personal knowledge” that the voter is a member of a different party.

Well, who cares about corporations? Only out-of-touch dilettante playboys like Mitt Romney who – hmm, let's see what I can produce from the bottom of the top hat – put his dog on the roof of his car as recently as 1984! That's where your gran'ma will be under the Republicans' plan, while your contraceptiveless teenage daughter is giving birth on the hood. "Corporations are people, my friend," said Mitt, in what's generally regarded as a damaging sound bite by all the smart people who think Obama's plan to use the Buffett Rule to "close the deficit" this side of the fourth millennium is a stroke of genius.

This editorial board has long been skeptical about this practice. Doling out cash to each ward's representative -- while perhaps more equitable than the former practice of using grants to reward or punish certain members -- dilutes its impact. It also feeds the outrageous practice of council members -- and most of them do it -- boasting to constituents that he or she used "my money" to improve this park or repave that street. It's not their money. It's the taxpayers' money -- period.

We're trying to determine if there are some golfers who have a golfer's cramp that would be equitable to writer's or musician's cramps. With dystonia there is no diagnostic test, so what we're doing is pattern recognition.

We're trying to narrow down the pool of golfers that may have a neurological disorder so we can do further studies.

A collection of works by prominent Maryland artists would have to include pieces by Grace Hartigan, and she is a commanding presence here. Selections include two large oils on the subject of Joan of Arc (one from 1996, appropriately for this exhibit, has something of an icon look), and, more imposing still, "Pale Horse Pale Rider," a masterful symphony of color and technique from 1991 that would, by itself, be worth a trip to Grimaldis.

"The police associations are pretty much neutered. They can scream or cry pretty much all they want, but it doesn't help," said Frank V. Rotondo, executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police.

Stewart, who had no points in the San Jose series, had five shots on goal in Game 4. He had a fight in Game 5 that seemed to spark the Blues en route to a 3-1 victory, clinching the series.
The group's modest goals for the meeting reflect its view that it needed to approach the Iranian regime cautiously on the issue and that a demand for quick action could be counterproductive. Yet the U.S. and its allies could come under attack from critics who believe that swift action is needed to halt Iran's production of enriched uranium, which can be used as bomb fuel if enriched to high levels.
He goes to work with a smile on his face and he comes home the same way. And before going to his Roscoe Village apartment one recent late afternoon, Kevin Elliott walks into the Northdown Café and Taproom with that very smile and with a new book under his arm.

“Obviously we added a little depth with Jamal. I think we’re, from watching the little bit of practice I have seen and mostly talking with Nate, he really likes the chemistry of our team right now. I think we have some guys who are hungry and guys are focused right now. We’ve had a really good couple days of practice this week.
3: Times since 2000 the UConn women's basketball team was not in the final four. This will be the Huskies' fifth straight trip.
Protein: The highest quality protein is found in eggs and is often used by scientists as a standard for measuring the quality of other protein sources. The minimum recommended daily allowance for protein for an adult is 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight (2.2 pounds = 1 kilogram). So for a 150 pound person, 55 grams of protein would be the minimum RDA.

Sutton's district now includes just a sliver of Cuyahoga County. But her new district is likely to creep deeper into the county, encompassing more of the western and southwestern suburbs. As Sutton's dismantling of Republican car dealer Tom Ganley showed on Nov. 2, her present territory is Democrat-friendly. The new district probably would be less so.
Whether the latest round of sanctions will have any effect beyond the symbolic is unclear. But U.S. and European officials say the penalties add to the cumulative pressure on Assad to abandon power.
This weekend, we join billions of people around the world in honoring Earth Day on Sunday, April 22.

A few key moments help to partly redeem the show. Cal's use of cue cards with large printing during a press conference is genuinely, cynically funny. Lines like "Can a person be drunk and hung-over at the same time?" are also both funny and memorable.
"I am shocked and extremely disappointed by the NFL's decision to suspend me for the 2012 season. Commissioner Roger Goodell has refused to share any of the supposed evidence he claims supports this unprecedented punishment. The reason is clear: I never paid , or intended to pay, $10,000, or any amount of money, to any player for knocking Kurt Warner, Brett Favre or any other player, out of the 2009 divisional playoff game, 2010 NFC Championship Game, or any other game. I never set out to intentionally hurt any player and never enticed any teammate to intentionally hurt another player. I also never put any into a bounty pool or helped to create a bounty pool intended to pay out money for injuring other players. I have always conducted myself in a professional and proud manner. I intend to fight this injustice, to defend my reputation, to stand up for my team and my profession, and to send a clear signal to the commissioner that the process has failed, to the detriment of me, my teammates, the New Orleans Saints and the game."
Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Joni Mitchell, Yoko Ono, Madonna, Britney Spears and Alicia Keys will be among the 50-plus artists showcased in the exhibit. It will highlight not only rockers, but also noteworthy women representing pop, country, R&B, hip-hop, disco and other genres.

2006: Jamie Horton, "The Clean House"
But Brown has a history of stirring things up, which he attributes to fighting a system without the proper tools. He grew up in Burlington City, and with a father and two grandfathers who were veterans, he always figured he would enlist. After basic training in 1997, Brown said he tried to qualify as a SEAL and failed three times before advancing to Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training, or the grueling six-month regimen known as BUD/S.

Europe in the world: The world still admires French art, Italian food and Spanish soccer. But in the global economy, sluggish Europe is looking less attractive when compared to fast-growing emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil.
“When you think of an ace, he is that,’’ Fielder told the Post after Sabathia showed just what kind of ace he is, pitching eight strong innings in a 6-2 win over the Tigers on a day the Yankees struggling rotation needed a CC pick-me-up.
Ray also said he would welcome a more vibrant menu at David's.
Braves starter Tommy Hanson lasted just 3 2/3 innings and gave up eight hits and four runs with two walk. He threw 95 pitches and recorded 11 outs.

Thank you, too, to Caroline Griffin and her inspiring work leading the anti-cruelty task force. Hers is a powerful voice for animals that is much needed in Baltimore.
Florida vs. New Jersey
I can appreciate the convenience of having wine directly shipped to a person’s home, but it should not be done at the expense of New Jersey’s financial stability and its children. The fact is, in New Jersey, we have a three-tier distribution system in place to protect our great state’s citizens, children, safety and revenue. The system has worked since 1933, and we should not be bullied by out-of-state wineries that seek to destroy it. The three-tier system has led to 60,000 retail jobs in our state; if we were to allow direct shipping, those New Jersey jobs could all but disappear.
"It's not enough to say to an individual, 'Do you identify with a particular tradition?' That doesn't have much substance and, therefore, may not have much meaning rather than an idea just floating around in their head," said Scott Thumma, a sociologist of religion from the Hartford Institute for Religion Research. "The real difference comes when someone says that and is connected to a community and is active in the local context."
Since 1979, three federal judges have been murdered in the United States.

We've made it to March. We're enjoying our sun breaks when we get them, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves. (Spring is not here.) But there's a lot to like in town this weekend, regardless of the weather, as you'll see throughout this lovingly-curated list of Portland events.
The crime comes with a recommended sentence of up to six months, but Diamond could be placed on probation, an option U.S. District Judge John Adams cited during the hearing.
In January 1907, Piedmonters voted to incorporate, and on Jan. 31, they became residents of the state's newest city.
Lesson: It's difficult to earn a return anywhere these days without taking on undue risk. Consider U.S. Series I Savings Bonds, whose rates adjust with consumer prices, or stable value funds found in many 401(k)s.
It's too bad the first game was in Safeco Field on a gloomy, chilly night in the Pacific Northwest when the roof was closed, though. You need the natural fireworks of sunset to make it perfect.

The company had figured most St. Louis workers would opt to take jobs at the Wentzville plant. But delays in the plant's opening put the squeeze on laid-off workers. The clock was ticking on unemployment benefits paid to the St. Louis production employees sidelined by the 1978-79 downturn in domestic car sales.
"There are so many social benefits, like a driver’s license and Social Security, that these people are exempt from utilizing because of the outstanding warrants," Howard said. "It’s pretty fundamental stuff."
Rookie Chris Kreider, whose first NHL goal was the winner Monday, forced a turnover and got the puck into the Ottawa end. Ryan Callahan nudged it ahead to Derek Stepan, who sent a pass from the right circle to the left circle to Staal for his first goal of the series 4:46 into the second.

The funding is part of California's global-warming law known as AB 32, signed in 2006 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. It requires the state to emit the same levels of greenhouse gases by 2020 as it did in 1990 -- a drop of about 15 percent when population growth is factored in.
One of the things we most enjoyed was the Limoncello mascarpone cake, priced at $8.50, as are all the deserts. This is creamy and flavorful yet almost fluffy; it contrasts with the dullness of the routine ricotta cheesecake. With opportunities such as the cranberry pecan tart and the apple tart with vanilla syrup, it’s better to step away from the ordinary here.
Should I watch the Oscar-nominated "War Horse," or should I break out the popcorn for "Kung Fu Panda 2"? I could watch "The Artist," or I could see Han Solo and James Bond dress up in old west gear and fight space invaders in "Cowboys & Aliens." (I hear it's terrible, but I still want to see it.)
When McCormick began recruiting for the post, though, it became evident there was little interest in it. That, combined with a re-evaluation of the diocese’s services when Bishop David O’Connell took over its leadership in 2010, ended up meaning an end to the official relationship between the two entities.
"I thought our girls played very well," Villa said. "Waterloo has a very good team and to come out and be ahead 3-0 at the half is a feather in our cap. I thought our girls hustled and passed pretty well.
I sampled most and enjoyed all that I tried. My favorites were the carved ham, lamb chops, and the Bloody Mary infused with blue cheese and horseradish.

The decision to suspend the mailings was unrelated to the talk of a possible partial government shutdown. It was, however, related to the agency's operating budget, which has essentially been frozen at 2010 levels — minus about $350 million in economic stimulus money the agency had been using to handle claims.
Gillespie has costumes - including a deerstalker cap and magnifying glass for one group's detective, and a glam wrap for the other's composer, Miss Beyonce - and the promise that laminated signs bearing photos of the instruments each child represents will be ready for the next day's performance.

That's what Kay Barna hopes too. She has been selling collectibles from her 92nd and Foster building for two decades, but the tight economy has forced her to stop adding to her inventory. She is trying to clear boxes of stuff she hasn't looked at in years. A sign on her window says she is "scaling down."
"We're not going to memorialize the last game because this isn't the final game in Sacramento," said James Ham, co-founder of the Here We Stay grass-roots movement formed when the Maloofs flirted with a relocation to Anaheim. "Last year against the Lakers, we had people manning Twitter and Facebook. We would tweet something and all of a sudden thousands of people would start the 'Here We Stay' and 'Sacramento' chants. But we don't have anything planned (tonight). There's just too much uncertainty in the air. Unless something dramatic happens in the next few days, we probably won't know what the future holds until the (relocation) deadline next year."
By the time we reached stand-up human status, my quads were so far expired that I walked like a bowlegged cow. Ten hours and 55 minutes after our departure, Hotel Central appeared on the horizon. We stumbled to our rooms, where very cold showers washed layers of Concepción down the drain.
"We acted as a pass-through," Drinkard said. “They came to us about wanting to unify their operation into a single campus. Alpharetta is a technological hub. ... We would like to see schools like that flourish within the city.”

The 7-year-old suffered "undetermined" injuries to her ear when a stray bullet pierced two walls of the building, according to Glover, who said it was unclear if the bullet actually struck the girl or if she was injured by debris caused when the round when it hit the wall. The man appears to have been shot in a stairway outside the building, Glover said.
Yet it's not just the radicals trying to create these fictional narratives.
Consider who will be receiving benefits and how much if the programs go bankrupt. Answer: Nobody and nothing. You might want to tell your congressfolks to stop playing politics and fix the programs now before its too late.
Either way, the bill will be astounding: Expect $250 a head with tip, tax, and some wine. But few places in America, let alone Philadelphia, can match Vetri's combination of unique flavors and personalized sophistication. If you can afford the fee, it's worth it.

Superior Court Judge Rosemary Ramsay, sitting in Morristown, ruled Tuesday that the state must pay the settlement, along with $87,000 in legal fees to the ex-ranger's attorney. She said the ex-ranger did not act with “willful misconduct,” so he won’t have to pay anything, according to the ex-ranger’s attorney.

"They are asking the citizens and the taxpayers to go into partnership with them," he said. "If I'm going to go into a partnership, I'd like to see what the details are. What right do they have to conceal that information from me? It seems like they're setting themselves up for a legal fight. Maybe they should release the information and everybody would be happy."
They play mostly half court — which means in games of 5-on-5 the lane gets as jammed as the Jones Falls Expressway at rush hour — but also go full court when the crowd thins toward the end of their two-hour sessions.
Yet in October 2009, two days before the state Forensic Science Commission was to hear testimony from Beyler, Perry replaced three members, including the chairman. Since then, the commission has been engaged in a series of political power struggles that has ensnared its members and even the state attorney general, who significantly limited the commission's jurisdiction in July. Next month, the panel will vote on its final report in the case.
Several lawsuits filed in federal court by civil-rights and other organizations contend the law is so vaguely written that it will lead to widespread racial profiling and other civil-rights violations of minorities by police who assume illegal immigrants look Hispanic and therefore will be more likely to question people about their immigration status based on their appearance or accent.
U.S. builders started work on fewer homes in March after they sharply cut back on apartment construction. But builders requested the most permits for future projects in 3 ½ years, suggesting many see the housing market improving over the next year.
Justice Department officials said Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. routinely received reports about myriad ongoing investigations around the country, and that the reports did not disclose that ATF agents were purposely "walking" the weapons.

The three members of Team Blake who got to skip offstage scot-free were the aforementioned Erin Willet, former Alicia Keys backup singer Jermaine Paul and 17-year-old country spitfire Raelynn, who dropped an S-bomb on live television when her name was chosen. Since she is still considered a minor, I'm sure the FCC won't be fining her anytime soon.
And so I did. With a bit of butter, milk, salt and pepper, I had a delicious vegetable dish with the consistency of mashed potatoes. The next night, I made it again (only this time on purpose). But instead of mashing by hand, I used the food processor to ensure an even smoother, mashed potato-like consistency. Adding a bit of cumin made it even better.
"We've been impacted by the heavily subsidized, dumped product from the Chinese," said Gordon Brinser, president of SolarWorld Industries America Inc. But, he said, "We're confident in our ability to stay here and grow the jobs and keep manufacturing in the U.S."

The Saints controversy comes at a critical time for the NFL, which is enjoying record popularity and revenues projected to approach $10 billion this year. Dozens of former players have filed lawsuits against the league, arguing that hits they absorbed while playing football are the cause of chronic health problems, including brain damage from multiple concussions.
Let your imagination -- and the Peeps -- run wild.
In the 19-tune set, Perry layered emotion into each number, whether it was in a nod to old-school R&B in a cabaret retooling of “I Kissed a Girl” or whipping “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),” one of last summer’s hottest songs, into effervescent pop.
But the water trail is a visual feast even without the animals. The mangrove trees that line the trail seemingly grow straight from the water. These tangled webs of wood look as though they could reach out and pull you in, boat and all.

The lead singer's birth name is Afie (AY-fee) Jurvanen, and he spent three years playing guitar and keyboards in (Leslie) Feist's touring band. Bahamas appears April 7 at Schubas in a show not to be missed by fans of the hushed soul of M. Ward and Jack Johnson. Playing guitar, Jurvanen leads a unique band consisting only of drums and two female vocalists. This establishes musical freedom and the ability to extend sections from his beautiful records "Pink Strat," released in 2009, and the new "Barchords." He plays in the moment.

Hundreds of travelers were delayed, and a dozen who stayed in the terminal Friday night were given pillows and blankets, Hamm-Niebruegge said. All had left the airport by Saturday morning, and officials thought most were staying with friends or family. Still, Hamm-Niebruegge said it could have been worse — the storm hit on a night when the airport is generally less busy.

Do we have enough water? As a board member for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, I can tell you the answer is complicated. The bad news is that this year is shaping up to be San Jose's driest ever with only 4.65 inches of rainfall measured to date, beating out the 1877 low, which was just 4.82 inches. The good news is that thanks to last year's heavy rains, our groundwater storage levels are normal. So, it is unlikely that the board will need to call for any mandatory water use reductions.
"To this day, I still haven't argued. I just asked him for an explanation. I said `Why would you think we're throwing at people in a one-run game or they're throwing at people in a one-run game?' It's not like it's a 10-run game or anything, it's still a hell of a game going on," Gonzalez said.

One source of frustration is Obama's stance on same-sex marriage — he has yet to endorse it even though he advocates equal rights for gay and lesbian couples. Tensions may mount as activists and many leading Democrats call for the Democratic National Convention to support marriage equality in the platform it will adopt in September.
Many promising startups wind up on the shopping list of corporate giants.

McIlroy, who returned to No. 1 in the world, used Quail Hollow as a launching pad toward stardom when he won here two years ago. Perhaps this is the start of a rivalry for years between a pair of 23-year-olds who bring power, flair and exuberance to the game.

But the Indians steadily closed the gap to trail 34-31 at halftime. They were then down 40-37 after two Stubblefield field throws with 4:58 left in the third quarter when Carlyle used a 13-0 scoring blitz -- the last nine were scored by Rakers -- to take control 50-40 with 1:36 to go.
Again: Granted, the distinction between military and law enforcement facets is not a bright line. But neither is it a distinction without a difference. And the more we couch our thinking in military categories, the more we open ourselves to misadventures like the absurd and deepening one in Libya.
Such targeted plans will help grow emerging industries by ensuring a skilled work force. I'll work to achieve this by passing the Strengthening Employment Clusters to Organize Regional Success (SECTORS) Act, which cleared the House last year with bipartisan support.
Wallace and the Blazers have learned this the hard way. After averaging 19.1 points per game and shooting 53.6 percent from the field over the final 13 games of the regular season, Wallace has been a no-show in the postseason, averaging an even-quieter-than-it-sounds 11.8 points per game and committing a team-high 14 turnovers. He shooting 40 percent from the field (20-for-50) and 18 percent from three-point range (2-for-11).
Armisen and Brownstein first got to know each other several years ago, through their shared interest in music -- Brownstein was a member of Sleater-Kinney, and Armisen had been a drummer for a band called Trenchmouth. Armisen started making trips from his New York home base to hang out in Portland with Brownstein, a Redmond, Wash., native who moved here in 2001. The pair worked together on a series of short comic videos they called "ThunderAnt," which became the inspiration for "Portlandia."

Built in 1991, the finely appointed home is broken up into cozy and comfortable living spaces, making the 7,771-square-foot residence inviting instead of monolithic. Inside, the marble rotunda of the formal entry mimics the courtyard in shape, a stylistic theme again repeated in the broad eyebrow arch of windows above a wall made up of French doors and sidelights. From here you get the first glimpse into the tropical lushness of the backyard.

SLOTBACK – Bishop, Munoz, Cummings, Singler, Ackerman. Comment: Again, what kind of player will Jordan Bishop be in the fall after spending the spring on crutches? Every time Munoz starts looking like a key player, he tweaks something. Cummings looks about 165 pounds dripping wet, but he’s got potential. So does Ackerman.

"Economic pressures have historically had an adverse affect on continued enrollment in high school," said Bill Reinhard, a spokesman for the Maryland State Department of Education. "Researchers have found that dropouts say they are leaving to get a job or care for a parent or relative, or they are bored by their classes, but many also come from families struggling with poverty."
"Gov. Strickland was picked to be a co-chair because of his shared belief with the president that we must have an economy that strengthens the middle class and gives everyone a fair shot at the American Dream," Obama campaign spokesman Frank Benenati said in an emailed statement. "Just as the president did nationally, as governor of Ohio he led the state through the global economic recession by investing in education, working to create jobs in growing industries like biotech and clean energy and supporting the auto rescue -- all of which have helped turn the state's economy around."

"She is the antimatter of what describes a Hollywood star: She has a very cultivated, unconventional look and presentation, she has been long involved with iconoclasts like Derek Jarmen and new indie filmmakers, and she always takes on tough, gritty roles without regard for playing a likable character. Therefore, we enjoy and appreciate her performances because of her talent as an actress, not as a symbol of some fantasy life."
For more than 100 years, the Actor’s Fund, a $26.7 million human-services organization, has been providing health care, employment training and housing to actors, writers, dancers and musicians who otherwise find themselves barely eking out a living while working toward their big break.

The pathological obsession this country has with some woman being America's princess, with the demand that she be pure, wholesome and beyond reproach is not only sexist garbage, but a function of the ongoing delusions about this country's own wholesomeness and purity.
Victor Dricks, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said the salp pose no threat to the plant. Curtailing operations while the creatures cling to the filters is a prudent move for PG&E, he said, because any potential shutdown is easier when the generator is at less than full power.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2007 ruled that the EPA must exercise its duty to regulate carbon emissions under the authority granted by the Clean Air Act unless it finds that the emissions do not contribute to climate change, according to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. The Ohio Environmental Council says that every test of that ruling has been met, leaving the EPA no choice but to regulate.
Walker reiterated his promise on Saturday, saying he has built the foundation to fulfill it.
"He was a die-hard Duck, and rightfully so," said his son, Dennis. "They did so much for him as a person and for his life. Those were some of the best years of his life. It was a turning point. He wouldn't have gone to college if it wasn't for the opportunity to play football."
This isn't how it was supposed to happen. Washington's Bryce Harper, 19, was going to be promoted after hitting Paul Bunyan shots in Triple-A, demanding a new ZIP code with every swing. Instead, he's a stopgap, creating uncertainty and drama that made his Saturday arrival even cooler. Manager Davey Johnson has wanted Harper on the team since spring began. He watched Dwight Gooden dominate as a kid and has a refreshing, if not reckless, "let-the-kid-play" attitude.
The same section of main had ruptured three weeks earlier, flooding his neighbor's home. Gonzalez and his wife packed up to leave. The next day, the cast iron pipe broke a third time.
The performances are solid, the cinematography is stunning, and the setting is intriguing. But the whole thing feels bloodless, hitting us over the head with its understatedness. Anytime a film's soundtrack features The Shins, James Taylor, and Nick Drake, you know you're in for an overly laid back time.
According to an interesting story in the San Mateo County Times, this trend has reached something of a peak at a high school school where a father is going to court to keep his son from facing the school's discipline for cheating. No one is denying that the boy broke the rules, copying essay homework from another student, but the father's argument is that the punishment -- throwing the sophomore out of the English honors course -- is too harsh because a regular English course doesn't impress colleges as much as the more rigorous class. The teen will still be allowed to enter the schools advanced International Baccalaureate program in the fall, and the cheating will not show up on any records sent to colleges, according to the newspaper.
A Clayton police officer handed the ticket to Ritz general manager Patrick Franssen that night, and Police Chief Thomas Byrne also dropped by the hotel.
Inspired by the nearby Sierra Nevada, a "waterfall" would splash down next to a new spa, framed by trees and native California plants. About 35 tons of boulders were hauled in to create that Sierra look.
But there is a line between the process of growing up and enduring some name calling, and the systemic, relentless, psychological, emotional and physical torment that pushes kids as young as 11 years old into suicide. It is this darker side of bullying that the new documentary "Bully" shines a bright, harsh light.
Smitek presented the plat April 18 with all the issues corrected. But the phase he presented was originally approved in 2007 as the final phase of the development.
Comment: Strong and durable. Good balance as he hits the hole. Sees field well. Impressive footwork in running and catching drills at combine. Had 41-inch vertical jump. Still, Wilson said he was not fully healthy at combine. Clocked between 4.35 and 4.4 at pro day. Can return kicks. Ball security is a concern. 2011: 290 carries, 1,709 yards, 9 TDs.

Carpenter returned to Roger Dean Stadium on Monday morning after four days of neurological testing in St. Louis. While Carpenter said doctors could not pinpoint the source of nerve irritation that has caused him weakness in the shoulder, he did indicate he would enter a program to strengthen the region before again taking the mound.
If you're looking for a common thread in the Ravens' three victories in 2011, it's that they absolutely mauled the quarterback. They went after Ben Roethlisberger, Sam Bradford and Mark Sanchez like the Visigothic army spilling over the gates of Rome. And even on plays where they didn't drive the quarterback into the turf for a sack, they smacked him around as he was releasing the ball. That either makes it harder to throw an accurate ball, or at the very least it leaves behind a reminder that you'd better rush your throw next time or you might not be so lucky.
Dombrowski said the Tigers aren't allowed to take their own discipline against Young beyond what Major League Baseball did. "There is no dual discipline from the commissioner's office or us," Dombrowski told a news conference about 10 minutes after the suspension was announced. "That's been pretty much the standard for years."
Kristen Wiig, "Saturday Night Live"
Griffin is the perfect comedian for these celebrity-obsessed times. Don't look for any insights into the human condition -- her humor is proudly superficial. But there's no one better at making fun of such topics as the reality TV shows of which she's inordinately fond.

What's hot: Load the app, turn on your hotel room TV, get the access code and voila! Your smart phone or iPad is your new remote control. No more hunting for the channel guide. The app also has two other sections: My Hotel and Local (attractions, events and food), which are being ramped up for concierge-like service. Using my iPad as a remote is more comfortable than using the hotel's remote. It will be nice when programming features are added so I can check for my favorite shows before returning to my room.
Surely, Cordray has received donations from the state party, labor unions and lawyers who got special contracts that are routinely doled out by the attorney general’s office. But is it "almost exclusively" from those sources? And can DeWine really lay claim to a much broader grassroots fundraising base?
Appearing before the committee at the same time Cogger was making his farewell speech, Rilee said few people, if any, dispute the importance of protecting the water in the Highlands region. He cautioned lawmakers not to confuse his positions on the act with his commitment to protecting the region.
Cook the greens: In a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high, heat the olive oil. Toss in the garlic clove and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chard and wilt it down, about 2 minutes, then add the spinach, a few handfuls at a time as they wilt down. Season with salt and pepper.

"The Cleveland Museum of Art and our Cleveland Orchestra are such incredible Cleveland treasures, and the gems lure all of us back again and again to the appreciation of why we love our city so much. When we visit cities in Europe that also treasure their culture we sometimes wonder why the arts are so undervalued by many in the United States, and have concluded that our nation is too young to appreciate what matters most. Here people want to consume material goods, but our art museum is free to all. This is just incredible to most of the rest of the world who have to pay to see great art. We can get there on public transportation and not even have to pay for the parking. Thanks for the University Circle shuttle bus and RTA."

Rodriguez spent the past year as a CBS Sports Network analyst. His three-year stint at Michigan was volatile. He was fired after going 15-22 (6-18 in Big Ten play). Michigan had the program's worst record (3-9) in his first year and then went 5-7 and 7-6, a departing season ending at the Gator Bowl. His zone-read, spread-option offense was received coolly there, and his final team's defense was awful. The Wolverines are 9-2 this season.

They frequently found facilities without private changing areas or women's clinics, staff members who did not believe they'd been in combat, and doctors unfamiliar with their health needs. In 2009, the Government Accountability Office said the VA wasn't doing enough to ensure female patients had complete privacy, noting that it had found in some facilities gynecological exam tables facing the door.
Both McLean and Midei were found to have purposely overestimated the arterial blockage in their patients and falsified medical records to justify the stents, which are inserted through a relatively simple procedure that typically costs $10,000 or more.

The long odds against Santorum -- frankly, it's hard to make a case that you can be elected president when the last time you ran for office you lost in your home state by 17 points -- got a even longer this week. After John McCain penned a Washington Post op-ed arguing that torture and techniques such as waterboarding should have no place in American interrogation procedures, Santorum told conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt that his former colleague "doesn't understand how enhanced interrogation works." One problem with that statement: McCain was tortured during his five years as a POW in North Vietnam. McCain has said nothing, but his daughter Meghan tweeted that "Rick Santorum lecturing my father about torture is like J-Woww lecturing Malcolm Gladwell about writing," Santorum, who of course says he didn't mean to impugn McCain's heroism, should thank his lucky stars that Gingrich was sucking up the oxygen in the GOP tent this week.

This alternate supply-side focus doesn't come at the expense of the more traditional iteration, which many, if not most, Republicans on Capitol Hill adhere to. It's not hard to find a Republican member of Congress who'll argue that tax cuts would increase federal revenues by spurring economic growth.

Caro is properly enthralled by Johnson putting the power of the presidency behind a discharge petition that, by advancing, compelled a Southern committee chairman to allow what became the 1964 Civil Rights Act to get to the Senate, where Johnson's meticulous cultivation of another Southern chairman prevented tax-cut legislation from becoming hostage to the civil-rights filibuster. By taking such arcana seriously, and celebrating Johnson's virtuosity regarding them, Caro honors the seriousness of his readers, who should reciprocate the compliment.

Zimmerman's measure also takes some lessons from last year's campaign: Limiting the allowed amount to 2 ounces or less will make it hard for law enforcement officials to argue that the measure would benefit drug cartels, and the measure specifically retains existing penalties and laws for having pot on school grounds, selling to a minor, employing a minor to sell marijuana, driving under the influence or using pot in the workplace.
