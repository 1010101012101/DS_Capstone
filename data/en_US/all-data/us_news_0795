There are benefits to the city of having an NFL team in Los Angeles, and because there are, even to those who are not football fans, you can make a good case for some taxpayer money.

That means there's always a risk-reward going into battle, and at the same time, players can finish the game.
• Rob Moseley, Eugene Register-Guard: Wednesday update: Thomas feeling ready to go: Thomas said he thinks he can play start to finish against the Huskies, and anticipates a chippy matchup based on the history of the rivalry, which he said older fans have told him about.

Stepan spent most of the year centering Artem Anisimov and Marian Gaborik on a line that created off the rush and found open spaces.

I mentioned the Giants got a lot of big “breaks” in this game. Don’t take that the wrong way. I don’t mean they were lucky. Not even close. (Though the loose balls squirting out of the Cowboys’ hands were fortunate happenings for them.) Note the word “lucky” doesn’t even make an appearance in that story. Nor should it because what I’m saying is they often kept their poise while the Cowboys made dumb mistakes. In addition to the ones I mentioned already, note the two players (RB Sammy Morris and WR Jesse Holley) colliding on punt coverage as they tried to crack back on Kiwanuka, who nearly blocked the punt. That’s two times in two games the Giants nearly blocked a punt.

A squared-off navigator can be more wearable, especially for someone who has full cheeks."

His most recent book that he wrote and illustrated was "Bumble-Ardy," a naughty pig party which came out in 2011, based on an old animated skit he worked up for "Sesame Street." In recent months, he had said he was working on a project about noses and he endorsed  against his best judgment  Stephen Colbert's "I am a Pole (And So Can You!)", a children's story calculated to offend the master.

Capturing the perspectives of these many participants is a formidable task, one to which Taylor rises with aplomb. "Exorcising Hitler" is gripping and humane, but Taylor does not sacrifice scholarship in the interest of storytelling. He makes use of an array of primary sources (many in German), and the book's informative endnotes assess the reliability of many secondary sources as well.
Indigo makes blues and purples as well as mixing with other hues. Redding's orange comes from eucalyptus. And dark turquoise? That's eucalyptus overlaid with indigo.

In fact, the only way to describe this movie's trio of party-throwing protagonists is numbingly predictable, as if writers Michael Bacall and Matt Drake had "Superbad" on a loop in the background: There's quiet student Thomas (Thomas Mann) looking to get laid; his obnoxiously crude bestie Costa (Oliver Cooper) looking to get laid; and nerdy, overweight third wheel JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown), looking to get laid.
Expectations that the 158-year-old Lehman would survive dimmed after Barclays PLC withdrew its bid to buy the investment bank. Barclays and Bank of America were considered front-runners to buy Lehman, which is foundering under the weight of $60 billion in soured real estate holdings.

Since cyclists know the feeling of terror when a driver makes a turn without using their turn signal, I would suspect that cyclists are more responsible, road-conscious drivers than the non-cyclist. That "lever thingy" can save lives as well, and perhaps the roads would be safer if there were "use your turn signal" signs posted along busy streets in San Francisco.
His death, The Joplin Globe points out, came 72 years to the day after his major-league debut.
Police believe Downey, 27, also met his alleged killer the night he was slain. Downey and Staten spoke "numerous times" on a telephone chat service less than 24 hours before deciding to meet in person on March 15, Essex County’s Chief Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Fennelly has said.
If a team wants McCoy, it would probably only be willing to surrender a sixth- or seventh-round pick. The final four rounds of the draft take place on Saturday, beginning at noon. But a source said the Browns ideally would like to take a little time to think about what they want to do. They might also have to make a decision on Seneca Wallace, who's set to make $2.4 million in 2012 and $2.85 million in 2013.
The district recently sent out a request for bids for insurance brokerage services at the urging of Citizens Campaign, a good government group that contends that inflated insurance contracts and brokerage fees waste taxpayer dollars.

øFrom there we move on to the people in your life. It is easy to get so caught up in the business of life that we lose sight of what kind of people are occupying our space. As you can see, when that happens it can become a problem.
When I say stepping into the breach, I mean putting money on the table to keep parks from closing -- money that comes from people like you and me. This is not something we had planned on doing, but we have no choice. Closing parks helps no one and does very little to improve the state's bottom line. It only reinforces the notion that we are in an inevitable cycle of doom that we have no control over and can't get out of, neither of which is true.
øAs a Sept. 13 birthday, he's one of the youngest players available this year, and that plays in his favor since he presumably has even more development left in him than most others in this class.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- It's out with the old and in with the . . . old.
Christie went to speak to the House Republican conference and to meet with some members of New Jersey's Republican delegation, according to spokeswoman Maria Comella.
Why it rates: The conference, at Mission Valley's Town & Country Resort this week, is part trade show, part international brewers' reunion and part excuse for locals to party with visiting beer celebs. Tonight's Blind Lady bash, for instance, toasts some of the nation's best canned brew and their brewers: Avery, New Belgium and Oskar Blues, all from Colorado; Maui Brewing; San Francisco's 21st Amendment; Chico's Sierra Nevada; and L.A.'s new Golden Road.
The key, then, will be for race organizers to work hard to stay in the neighborhoods' good graces and to mitigate the impact of the race. BRD's promise to donate at least $100,000 a year for community improvements is a sign that race organizers recognize that and plan to follow through. But the city needs to make sure BRD sees that as the beginning of its commitment to the affected neighborhoods, not the end.

Pollock, it turned out, was living in Manhattan. He had been told he had bipolar disorder in the 1950s, but that had not stopped him from making furniture into the 1980s. But when a chair he created for Olivetti never saw the light of day because of the company's financial difficulties, Pollock abandoned design and began producing paintings and sculptures instead.
Joan Jett looks like she's having fun posing with a garbage can in one of the photos in the show. Lou Reed, on the other hand, was anything but fun.

He said many of the changes Christie proposed — such as tying funding to average daily attendance, instead of a once-a-year enrollment count each Oct. 15 — would require legislative change.
In the dispute between the House and the Senate, Mr. Busch was right on the tax issue — he insisted on a smaller overall tax increase and to shield those who make less than $100,000 — and he was right on the gambling issue. There is no reason for the state to consider expanding its gambling program until its existing one is fully up and running. But he made a mistake in allowing himself to be sucked into the tax and gambling gamesmanship. If there are not enough votes for the gambling plan the Senate initially forwarded to the House — as appears clear — Mr. Busch should simply have allowed his chamber to vote it down a week ago.
In a Republican presidential debate last month, Romney had referred to the payroll tax cut embraced by Obama as an example of “temporary little Band-Aids’’ that won’t fundamentally help the economy.
Global warming has become perhaps the most complicated issue facing world leaders. On the one hand, warnings from the scientific community are becoming louder, as an increasing body of science points to rising dangers from the ongoing buildup of human-related greenhouse gases -- produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels and forests. On the other, the technological, economic and political issues that have to be resolved before a concerted worldwide effort to reduce emissions can begin have gotten no simpler, particularly in the face of a global economic slowdown.

Truffle is everywhere on Goosefoot's menu, including a "dehydrated" truffle powder, served on a dish of seared Angus beef. (Truffle oil is mixed with a modified food starch called tapioca maltodextrin that dehydrates the oil, allowing a fluffy powder to form.) When the powder hits your tongue, it rehydrates in tiny explosions, like a bunch of Dippin' Dot ice cream pellets invading your mouth. It's strange, but invigorating. I'm now convinced every movie theater should have this on hand as a popcorn topping.
Conversely, fig and apple notes in many unoaked Chardonnays underscore the harvest flavors.

While investors were encouraged, employees at American had new reasons to worry about their jobs.

But he was back in 2005, alongside his appointed heir apparent, Ryan Seacrest."
If some economists quoted recently by The Wall Street Journal are correct, the dollar is in for some hard times in coming months, with some holding out the possibility of a "free fall" in value. The dollar has lost 18 percent of its value against the euro despite widespread European economic woes. The Japanese yen is up 13 percent against the dollar.

Main courses sometimes seem as if they issue from an entirely different kitchen, probably because the menu was designed by former chef Josh Smookler but is now being executed by KC Ma, who has worked at Water Grill and Craft. With the exception of the rustic roasted chicken served in its juices with caramelized Brussels sprouts and potatoes, and the skirt steak with fries, they tend to resemble something an aspiring cook with a subscription to Bon Appetit would whip up. Duck breast is fine, but the butternut squash purée smeared across the plate doesn't look appetizing. The flavors, though, are focused and direct. It would probably make a better impression to lose the pretentious square plates and any self-consciously trendy touches.

I played every game in the state tournament with that."

With no basketball commitment, Hopkins focused on football in the offseason, adding muscle and beefing up to 212 pounds.

Second, there are those who acknowledge that we cannot leave Afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we have. But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through, and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there.
