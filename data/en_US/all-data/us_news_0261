The Indians have been hit even harder in free agency than the Cavs were by LeBron James. The Tribe has developed All-Star players and then lost them to bigger markets in free agency or traded them before doing so.

Tea Party enthusiasts, like other Republicans, want a candidate who can beat Obama in the fall. But they also "don't want another Bob Dole as the nominee," says Schramm, referring to the 1996 Republican nominee.

BLOCK PARTY: Brad Stuart made a huge block on Martin Erat during a Nashville power play in the second period. Kevin Klein delivered one for his goalie in the third period, when Cory Emmerton took aim after picking up Miller's rebound. "That was awesome," Rinne said. "He's done that a lot this year. I guess he has a little bit of goalie instinct, but he made a huge block. ... Really saved a for-sure goal. That's obviously one of the key plays."

Things go from strange to weird when Alex encounters Ruthana, one of the fairy folk, bathing in a waterfall. She's golden-haired and willowy — 3 feet's worth of elfin foxiness. "I love you," she tells him on their first meeting, and from that moment on, Alex can't stop thinking of her, no matter how hard Magda tries to satisfy him. Matheson builds tension out of Alex's hopeless yearning — how long will he resist Ruthana? — and the uglier, jealous side of Magda (this includes some pretty formidable shapeshifting). Matheson is a master of the twist — and there are plenty here as poor Alex goes from lonely to lost. Each time he thinks he's safe, he's wrong.
Sgt. David Bonenberger, president of the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he has heard others talk of the scenario-based training but has not had the opportunity to take it himself.

The bit gave Fred Armisen one of his several opportunities in the episode to do accents, and they were good for a chuckle.

... a physical beast at 6-foot-2, 235 pounds, and one evaluator compared his power to that of Russell Branyan, another south Georgia lefthanded hitter. Green was dominating and putting on huge power displays against modest pitching, pushing himself into first-round consideration. However, scouts who saw him last summer recall he struggled mightily with velocity at the East Coast Pro Showcase. Greene is somewhat stiff but is an average runner, which should give him a chance to play left field, but some scouts think he'll wind up as more of a first base/DH type. Greene's value is mostly in his bat and well above-average raw power. He's likely to put on a display in individual workouts for teams prior to the draft.
Although researchers aren't sure that being overly tired would lead to actually consuming said plate of cinnamon rolls, they noted that more research on that might be warranted.

Known for his combative style and fiery closing arguments, McKay is a DePaul University graduate who worked his way through Chicago Kent-College of Law. Admitted to the Illinois bar in 1984, McKay was hired the next year by the Cook County state's attorney's office. He is a career prosecutor — a "lifer" in Criminal Court parlance. McKay's sometimes-abrasive style can draw crowds to a courtroom when he begins a cross-examination.

McClain did not dispute that account of Kisby's testimony, and indeed used it to make his own point: that Kisby "is out for herself." Because of that, he told the jury, she had every incentive in the world to blame the shady third-party Arno suggested was her true partner in crime.
In 2007, when the company where he had worked for 12 years was "in its death throes," Johnson managed to find another factory job.

Preheat the oven to 400°. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface or between 2 sheets of waxed paper until it is about 1/8-inch thick. Cut into rounds using a template (glass or round cutter) of about 2 3/4 inches. We used a fluted cutter from a nested set. Transfer the dough to a mini-muffin pan (24 to a pan).

Return the tart shells to the oven and bake for 5 minutes longer, rotating the pan once or twice until evenly browned. Remove and cool.
"Anyone who is paying attention would agree that Whitman is highly ambitious and aggressive," said Jennifer Chatman, a professor of leadership at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. "It would be naïve to think that one could survive in politics without at least some minimum level of these attributes. The problem is that, as research has shown, people who internalize the power they attain become a bit less careful and a little more bold, exemplified in the term 'drunk with power.'"

"Whereas my first record was generally a kind of a surprise compilation of seven years of recording, this new CD is from a very focused period of my life, which in itself was bleak but then kind of moved into a more hopeful space," said Jesty, a 1998 Olmsted Falls High School graduate who studied a few years at Boston's prestigious Berklee School of Music. "So that's what kind of this whole record in itself does sonically. It kind of documents the feeling of loss, the overcoming of loss and it's taken me into a more of a layered and produced sound."

And I know that sometimes, out here, when youre in theater, its not clear whether folks back home fully appreciate whats going on. And lets face it, a lot of times its easier to get bad news on the news than good news.

It had been a long time since Rodriguez performed such feats in front of a Yankee Stadium crowd. Including the ALDS, A-Rod had gone 48 at-bats without a home run in the Bronx. That came last season Sept. 4. His last three-hit game at the Stadium was June 12 last season. Of course, it didn’t help that Rodriguez, who battled a knee injury for much of 2011, hit .191 after the All-Star break last season. But his failure to deliver at the Stadium has made him the fans’ favorite scapegoat.

In 2006, ICE created a unit to respond to calls for assistance from local police, primarily when they encounter groups being held in drophouses or being transported in smuggling vehicles. The unit, staffed 24 hours a day, was created after former Gov.

Twelve years ago, the two watched the selection show together. No one expected much from Seton Hall in March 2000, but their run to the Sweet 16 is still the deepest the Pirates have gone in the tournament in the past two decades, and came just at a time when the campus needed a lift after a deadly dormitory fire.

But even that would demand substantially more consideration than the General Assembly can give it at this late date. There is little doubt that Maryland, like Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia, will eventually allow full casinos. And given that table games produce more employment and attract a more affluent clientele than slots, they would likely be an improvement for the state's existing gambling program. But voters should know the details before they are asked to vote on the matter, and there is simply no time in this legislative session to hold the hearings and debates that would be necessary to develop them.

BACKGROUND
Not all of "Coriolanus'" characters are motivated by such obstinate adherence to principle. The rival general Aufidius (Gerard Butler) is driven by a simple desire for victory, and Coriolanus' mother, Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave), is every bit his equal in blood lust. Although she never raises a hand, it's Volumnia who's the movie's most fearsome warrior, dressed in a double-breasted overcoat and a commando's beret as if she has just returned from the front.

Nova (3-1) was one win away from matching Roger Clemens' team record of 16 straight winning decisions. Since last June 10, Nova made 20 starts without a loss.

Leyland would be justified in using him more at DH to help him get started at the plate (Young has one homer and five RBIs) and because he has other players who are better defensive leftfielders.
The Senate bill makes retirement benefits more affordable to school districts, but mostly at the expense of employees. A better reform would be to close the pension system and offer new employees participation in a defined-contribution retirement system such as the 401(k) retirement savings plans commonly offered in the private sector. Closing the system, in contrast to the Senate bill, would benefit school districts, school employees and taxpayers alike, though it does put more responsibility on school employees to save and invest for their retirement.

Mina's lobster corn dogs may be time-consuming, but guests will be thoroughly impressed by a favorite treat reincarnated with sweet lobster and shrimp "sausage."
Still, food manufacturers and grain millers remain worried that the corn will spread through pollen or inadvertent mixing. Genetically modified crops have escaped at least six times in the past, according to a 2008 General Accounting Office report, in one case leading to produce recalls and more than $1 billion in losses to rice farmers. The agency said that "the ease with which genetic material from crops can be spread makes future releases likely."

Thayer's application for a parade from Daley Plaza to the western boundary of the summits' location, McCormick Place, predicted only 5,000.

But the night belonged to Jon Bon Jovi, who seemed both bewildered and slightly unnerved by the Internet rumors. They were clearly on his mind: He referred to them several times, and even pantomimed taking calls from concerned friends and family. Jon Bon Jovi is exactly the sort of world-famous, somewhat pompous establishment entertainment figure who Internet provocateurs love to target -- actor Scott Baio was also a recent victim of a similar hoax. Pranksters are declaring virtual victory this morning. Yet there's nothing particularly irreverent about forcing a public figure to declare or otherwise demonstrate that he is still alive. Mostly, it shows how easily social media can be used to annoy and alarm people. Even if you think what you're doing is funny -- and in this case, it really wasn't -- spreading false witness is never an acceptable thing to do.

National Energy Laboratory of Hawaii: What started as a futuristic experiment in generating electricity is now generating something completely different - abalone and lobster. The NELHA facility, which is near the Kona airport, still houses a plant for making electricity, but there's some serious aquaculture going on too.
