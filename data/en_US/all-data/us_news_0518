Spokesmen for both the Gaming Commission and Pinnacle declined to comment for this story. But conversations with others in the tight-knit gambling industry revealed concern that, while there's little sympathy for Pinnacle, state officials may be recklessly rewriting rules in a highly regulated business that relies on playing things by the book.
Shook and Dotolo aren't overly ambitious with the menu, but still not everything works. The glorious taste of fresh bay scallops is overwhelmed by a balsamic soubise. Vinegar is used over-enthusiastically in a couple of other dishes too. A few beads of smoked steelhead roe glisten on tiny mounds of over-whipped cream sweetened with maple syrup, not a combination made in heaven. Still, the thinly sliced pumpernickel "chips" inset into the cream are awfully cute — lacy, like one of Ted Muehling's silver earrings.
Summit put together a long drive in response, getting on the board with a 32-yard field goal from Ben Tesson.

Chartwells also buys beef for CPS from an Ohio-based meat processor, JTM Food Group. The company processes beef from sources that do not use LFTB or treat meat with ammonia, and that is what goes to CPS, according to Chartwells.
But a recent ruling by the U.S. Department of Education is confounding Missouri Baptist and every other institution using online classes to reach students in other states.

And like most, he failed at it. But where others gave up, he set about learning why. He read books and researched the history of archery. Somewhere along the way, he got hooked.
I'm not superstitious at all, but I do have rituals. On a typical match day I walk backwards from my house to the stadium with branches strapped to my feet. This erases my footprints as I go. And I usually eat half an Ox.
For if I do not teach my son to walk, speak, act like a man, to embrace his maleness, to respect life, himself, his mother and others; or should I fail to teach him that the only thing that ultimately makes a male a man is his willingness to assume responsibility, who then will teach him?
Statistical studies throughout the years indicate that Progressive Field favors left-handed hitters. So this isn't an accident.
“Unlike the governor, they toured the facilities, visited the communities and listened to testimony from employees, advocates, local officials, individuals and families,” said Henry Bayer, the executive director of theAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal EmployeesLocal 31. “In stark contrast to the Quinn administration, they considered all the evidence, reached the sensible conclusion and rejected each of the closures.”
Ramming this measure into law without due consideration is far from the measured decision-making required.
Avoid exercise and other vigorous activity outdoors. If you have traveled to a place that's hotter than where you live, avoid exercising for about a week in order to give your body time to adjust.
Police said they were considering the cases a homicide and were waiting for autopsy results to determine when and how the victims died.
Yes. Maybe.
The couple, along with their children, star in their own reality show, "Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood." Listing broker Madison Hildebrand of Coldwell Banker Previews International in Malibu says the couple decided to sell because they recently found out Ms. Spelling is expecting a fourth child and the home is too small.

"The county might consider loaning the city some money," he said. "We believe light rail is very, very important and a project that needs to get done. We'd be willing to listen to Milwaukie and discuss any figure amount."
As a relaxing diversion, model railroading appeals to a wide range of skills and tastes. I personally enjoy the hobby's creative challenges like designing trackwork and building scenery, while other aficionados prefer the fine details of miniature construction or the mechanical and electrical aspects. Many railroad enthusiasts get to exercise their talents in areas such as carpentry, circuitry, metal working and even computers.
As a city commissioner, he planted an anti-Walmart flag in his City Hall window. He fought the retailer's expansion so forcefully he had to recuse himself from casting votes against the company.

øKovalchuk's goal came on a quick counterattack in which he came late down the middle, took a pass from Travis Zajac and wristed a shot past the Flyers' goalie. The Russian, who had never been part of a winning team in an NHL series until this year's first round vs. the Panthers, pumped his fists and celebrated his fourth goal.
Neither Booker nor Cerf on Tuesday could say how much money the firm received to conduct the audit. The mayor on Tuesday said he had raised the money as part of his ongoing reform effort.

A: Twenty-three years ago, fine wines were sold in the independent off-premise shops like Dave's and Arcadia. The consumer was guided by the individual store owner. In the late '80s and '90s, fine wine off-premise shops with tasting bars, like Sportsman's, dominated. The consumer was given the opportunity to taste before purchasing. Today, a more educated wine consumer is buying fine wine in large, off-premise beverage outlets like Costco, BevMo and Total Wine.
On Saturday, one of my favorite Twin Cities breweries, Harriet, celebrates spring in a big way. Following the success of last fall's Rauchfest beer event, Harriet has put together Sol Bock Revival, a mini-fest dedicated to the release of its warm-weather beers (including the titular maibock). The all-day tent party will be highlighted by a long lineup of bands (including Natty Nation, the Reckless Ones and Javier Trejo), plus several food trucks. It's also the grand opening of the taproom, which will have a stage and a couple bars.

My point is, these businesses come into the community but don't really act like part of the community in the sense that a smaller or independent business has in the past.
It's worth noting that Hudson has had some awfully close role models in the non-marriage department. Actress mom Goldie Hawn and actor Kurt Russell (not her biological dad but she considers him as her father) have been together since 1983, but have maintained that marriage isn't necessary for a healthy relationship.

In those six words, Connally has summed up the case for why she should not be president. She has also revealed that even after 24 years as a judge, she doesn't understand the difference between what is legal and what is right.
This tax increase for libraries is absolutely ridiculous. It's unthinkable to tear down existing buildings that are totally functional. If they need an addition, put it on them. Do it. If they need air conditioning and heating improvements, do it. But don't tear the whole thing down and try to say that that's for libraries because it's not. It's just something for politicians or whoever runs the library districts to feel important at the expense of the taxpayers and the general public. What do they think we are, stupid?
Maria Gonzalez was believed to have been driving 68 mph in a 50 mph zone when she bumped the concrete barrier between the two directions of the highway and the left front tire went off kilter.

"From very early on in the writing process, which began in earnest in 2001, I was thinking about the possibility of a film," said Blackmon, a senior writer at the Wall Street Journal. "One of my primary goals was to reanimate these individuals' lives that had been so nearly extinguished by the malevolence of society. I was drawn to the idea of a film because it offered the possibility of doing that in a more powerful, cinematic way."

After a few unforgivably unflattering trims or highlights that come out orange, you want to call it quits and cut the hair dryer cord. Some break up with their stylists simply by leaving one day never to be seen again, sort of like Ross' pet monkey on "Friends."
The superlatives keep coming for Pujols, who also joined Ted Williams and Stan Musial as four-time runner-ups in MVP voting. All of that sets the stage for the biggest negotiations in Cardinals' history as they attempt to sign him in the coming month to a "Cardinal for Life" contract. Whatever happens, we know what the No. 1 story for 2011 will be.
One way or another, you have to pay the bill.

For diapering her children (who are now 28, 26 and nearly 22), Kuczmarski favored the top of the sink, using a changing pad (a folding affair that fits into a diaper bag). "Life and etiquette have not changed since the time when my three sons were small."
"The title for the show comes from a song by Rockpile," says Macoska, referring to the late-1970s band that featured Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe. "But it's also a reference to being a female photographer in such a male-dominated business. You always feel like you're crawling from the wreckage."

And lest I not cover the full range of production values, let me add that Olbermann's upper lip looked a little shiny at the start of the show. I know, I know, I am talking about cosmetics not substance. But TV is first and foremost a medium of cosmetics --and only rarely one of substance. Even Olbermann should know that based on his schoolboy understanding of Murrow.
"I got through it healthy," McNeal said after practice Tuesday, "and I'm looking to continue that."

"When you ride around the city today, what you see in terms of built environment is largely the result of the industrial revolution in Trenton," he said.

Eventually, the parents agreed to give up legal parental rights to their son.
At the center of this compelling drama is Kelley, completely at home in her authentic 19th-century rooms. She manages to convince us through the force of her acting skills that she is a wrenlike plain woman, although we may initially be struck by her resemblance to a young Vivien Leigh. Kelley's Emily is a woman of vision and intelligence who mischievously delights in becoming the eccentric recluse her ridiculing neighbors described as weird.
"We're going to make a few connections to the composer and the music," Gillespie says. "From the bass player perspective, there were passages (in Beethoven's music) that were considered unplayable when he wrote them. Now, of course, they're playable. We'll make connections like that."

Brooks’ swiftly staged production is played on one of the most eye-arresting sets of the season. Donyale Werle has made this watering hole quite lived-in. Shelves sport trophies from long-forgotten victories, while the walls display license plates, lacrosse sticks and even a tiny print of Edward Hopper’s "Nighthawks." One could say that the set has everything but the kitchen sink — but that’s probably there, too, behind the bar.

We then watch a very calculating Stein mesmerize an enthusiastic studio audience as he whips up a dish with the new cooking creme.
"Chris figures out ways to beat almost anybody," Mouch said.
It was a hot summer day when I visited La Chascona, a Quechua word meaning disorderly or disheveled, and an affectionate reference to the curly, knotted hair of Neruda's third wife, Matilde Urrutia. What first caught my eye were the couple's initials worked in metal on a window exterior. The "P" from his first name created a moon over an ocean, and the "M" from her name created the waves. Everything else about the house also had a nautical appearance, from the porthole windows and low ceilings to the ship-like wooden furniture.

Driving milestones: There's a big difference between driving a truck and a race horse, but Andrew Coblentz has proven he can do both. Owner of Coblentz Trucking in Wooster, the 53-year-old rookie harness driver scored his first pari-mutuel win Oct. 3 behind the trotting mare Pretty Tech. After coming off the starting gate in slot No. 6, Coblentz guided Pretty Tech to the lead on a sloppy track and never looked back, winning by a half-length in 2:06. It was a career-best mile for Pretty Tech.

One of them, No. 1 seed Temple, is definitely going to the NCAA tournament. Another, SLU, is very likely going to the NCAA tournament. A few other teams, Xavier, St. Joseph's and Dayton, have at-large chances of varying levels.

It is a common failing. The colorful former NBA star Darryl Dawkins liked to bounce the ball once to get his rhythm. Dawkins might have gotten rhythm out of a Gershwin song, but the delay of the bad-habit dribble let defenders foul him and make him earn the two points at the free-throw line.

That's when Laranas goes back again to 1988, when we learn how what happened 10 years later came to pass and how it relates to what's going on in the present time. This segment, in which a boy is tormented by his abusive -- psychotic, one would guess -- mother, mixes both the supernatural and the real in disturbing fashion (on both fronts), and it puts most of the pieces of the puzzle into place.

The Des Moines Register's Lance Bergeson jumps to Drake's defense. He makes some good points. Let's see what happens in the NCAA Championships, which are at Drake next season.

He’s part of the tradition. Let’s get to the guts of the tradition. There’s a problem with that kind of deodorizing. I worked very closely with him during the campaign and I would tell him all the time, ‘Brother Barack, in the words of Shakespeare, to thine own self be true.’”

A Cleveland snowstorm is preferable to a Gulf Coast hurricane.

Plus, you can have fun in the snow, and it can be absolutely beautiful. Water -- unless it has some sand around it -- not so much.
The short-rib entree ($24) was another home run. Tender short ribs, bits of crispy beef coated with a sweet and spicy mixture of sambal paste, garlic and sugar, thick udon noodles, and an egg, floated in a slightly sweet broth made with bacon dashi (dashi is Japanese stock— it's also the base for miso soup).

Q: On another aspect regarding Canadians, one of the points they make in favor of the government bridge as opposed to the Ambassador Bridge is where the Ambassador Bridge feeds into Windsor. It really slows their international trade and commerce to Toronto and other markets because of the stoplights on Huron Church Road and their inability to build a bypass where you are located.

brief, involuntary movements of the feet and legs. Most often it happens when in bed, but it also can happen when sitting in a chair. Something in the nervous system has gone wrong.

Securing Russian prospect Vladimir Tarasenko is the top priority. He is a terrific offensive talent. It sounds like he is amenable to leaving home. Tarasenko and Jaden Schwartz could add a lot of skill to the team's current framework. Both players will take time to develop, so the sooner the organization starts the process the better. Schwartz has gotten his taste of the NHL already and Tarasenko stood out playing against veterans in the KHL, so their growth could occur fairly quickly. Both will be Top 6 forwards in the NHL some day. That some day could come by next spring.

A closely followed Wall Street fear gauge closed around 19 on Monday, below the 48 it hit last August and well below the peak reading of around 80 in October 2008.

We followed the pendulum, did a lot of work. Now we're back, but we've always been focused in Northeast Ohio.

Choosing from the half dozen house-made sausages ($9.50/$18/$22.50) and a cheese board ($4.50-$25.50) is a good way to begin. The meats come on a cutting board, without accompaniments. They're good, but the deluxe platter with six kinds became a little monotonous after a while, especially since there's nothing to interrupt the richness, other than sips of wine. If you want something like olives ($3.50) or bread ($4.50), they're extra.

Considered the most famous canyon in the world, the Grand Canyon draws more than 5 million visitors a year. The canyon was carved over time by the Colorado River, and is the site of one of the United States' first national parks. The Pueblo Anasazi Indians lived here, and their influence continues to be found. The south rim is the most accessible by road or the Grand Canyon Railway and is also most developed. It is from this rim that adventurous visitors can hike or ride a mule to the Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the canyon. The north rim, with a much higher elevation, is often snowed in until May or June. The view from the north rim, when it can be reached, is considered even more spectacular than in other parts of the canyon.
