Armed with esoteric advice from economics, literature, and geography professors alike, we join the Peace Corps, try to become actors or write novels.

It is all things to all creatures great and small. To an army of cab drivers, it is an annual nest egg, whose limits are bound only by the hope that on this weekend of weekends they can latch on to one of those legendary fares like the visiting Saudi sheik, who came here one year as the guest of Ashland Oil and hired two cabs for the week — one for himself and one for his harem.
The Orioles' glory days from roughly 1975-1985 will be celebrated with photographs, memorabilia and, at times, the presence of O's great Rick Dempsey. Expect your traditional upscale bar fare — burgers, crabcakes and beer-battered fish. Plus beers brewed on-site.

The first major ad salvo of the campaign began Thursday with a new 30-second online ad produced by Rove's American Crossroads group, which is not affiliated with Romney's campaign.

Keeping in mind what the two men have done since the ‘70s, it didn’t seem so surprising that they are working together. Helm collaborates with all kinds of musicians in the Midnight Ramble concerts he presents regularly at his studio in Woodstock, New York.

Pew said support for bin Laden had been ebbing considerably before his death. In Jordan, for instance, 61 percent of respondents told pollsters in 2007 they had confidence that the terrorist leader would do the right thing. The next year, after al-Qaida suicide attacks against Amman, Jordan's capital, that number fell to 24 percent. By last year, it was lower still at 13 percent.
The addition of Arron Afflalo in that game was vital. In my opinion, no Nuggets player takes losses harder than Triple-A (his middle name is Agustin). So for him to sit out the game against Minnesota and watch his team get shellacked, you know that motivated him even more for the Bulls game -- and Afflalo was one of Denver's top players.
Fellow linebacker Gary Plummer was in his eighth pro season when Seau was a rookie in 1990, the No. 5 pick overall out of Southern California.
A cancer specialist, Agus discovered he has an above-average risk for cardiovascular disease and a slightly lower than average risk for colon cancer. His doctor put him on a statin to help prevent heart disease, and, he says, "my kids took it upon themselves to keep me away from french fries." He also had a colonoscopy at age 43, earlier than medical standards call for, and had a polyp removed. "Could my polyp have turned into cancer? Who knows? But why should I wait for that to happen? Unless our country can focus on prevention, which testing is all about, our health care costs will be completely out of control."
Council members had tried for years to boost their pensions but couldn't get it done. That started to change in June 1990, when the council unanimously passed a resolution directing Burke to establish a subcommittee to "study and suggest recommendations to the City Council for the most efficient and cost-effective method" to provide aldermen better benefits.

But no one could decide whether it was Jack, or Bobby, or both — and the talk of murder and cover-ups never grew louder than whispers.

There is scant evidence that the body-mass index of people in developed societies soared into unhealthy ranges for most of the 1,000 years studied, said Young.

The appeals court's ruling marks another setback for gay marriage opponents, who passed Proposition 8 in 2008 by a 52 to 48 percent vote.

Others suggested that officers should try harder to get to know youths in their beat areas to instill faith in the Police Department.
I realize that some party poopers will not share my delight at the Secret Service becoming a double entendre. But at the very least, this scandal, like the General Services Administration's spending spree in Las Vegas, should serve to refute claims that the federal workforce is out of touch with everyday Americans. As it turns out, some federal workers reflect our culture all too well.
Smart is the country's hottest young coach after posting an 84-27 record in his first three seasons at VCU. The Rams made one of the most surprising runs in history to the Final Four in 2011 after barely making the tournament.

First, though, I'd have to clean out the car. My poor car is a largeish station wagon, but it's filled with car seats and there isn't much room in it other than the front passenger seat. It gets filled with diaper bags, jackets, empty chip bags and bottles of soda. This is not a big deal during the week when it's just me, but my wife has no place to sit and it seems weird to have her follow us in her car when we go on family trips. So as I carried junk into the house, my wife stayed out on the sidewalk to let the kids play in the sun. Tiny Bits, our 18-month-old, found a stick and was going around blessing and/or whacking every plant he could get close to. Maybe he thinks he's a wizard and the stick is a wand; who knows -- he was happy and that's all that matters. Our other two boys -- 6-year-old Big Bits and 4-year-old Little Bits-decided the thousand and one toys we have in the house (and the several in the car) were unnecessary and were playing Invisible Football.

To be sure, many factors influenced whether a project could be done in time. The major ones for suburban lines include geographical obstacles like rivers, or conflicts that require negotiation with other agencies or railroad companies.

There is something about July's slight build and cartoon eyes, her frailty hiding ferocity, that would have been just right in romantic romps with Clark Gable, James Stewart, Gary Cooper.

"The numbers for 2009 are striking, head-snapping. But what really matters is what happens next," he said. "If it's just one year, then it's a remarkable thing, but it's totally manageable. If the economy doesn't recover soon, it doesn't matter what your social, economic and political agenda is. There's not going to be any revenue to pay for it."

And the lone competition Arizona had for Elliott's college commitment was UTEP.

A so-called A1C blood test indicates a person's average blood sugar over 90 days. Anything over 6.5 is too high. The average A1C in the intervention group fell from 7.3 to 6.6; in the control group it only went from 7.3 to 7.2. Weight loss also brought lower cholesterol and blood pressure, and a reduced need for medication to control all those factors.

The dinner was one of many served from New York to Memphis, Tenn., and across the oceans to Hong Kong, as chefs attempted to transport diners to a time when waiters in starched coats and napkins hanging from their arms served an upper class that was far removed from the common man, who filled the lower portions of the Titanic and went largely unnoticed by the wealthy until they perished together in the cold sea.

One of the first major challenges was recruiting. The decision to move was finalized in January, which narrowed the window for luring talent. Locals are hard to come by, so the Lindenwood staff had to cast a net wide enough to lure athletes from Finland to Alberta.

Anyone who has rehabilitated a serious injury knows that you go through a stage of attempting to gain motion, to a stage of attempting to build strength to a stage of attempting to become what you once were.

øMake a difference. Businesses only succeed when they meet a real need. But those needs can be petty or small: Think of those who've created reality shows about housewives and New Jersey. Instead, look to fill needs that are important, your contribution positive. Do something -- create something -- that has an impact. It doesn't have to be world-changing -- you don't have to invent a miracle medical device or devise a way to feed the world's poor. But whatever you choose to do, try to have a beneficial impact on the world you inhabit.

Excerpt: If the trustees didn't remove Paterno and give this horrible scandal some much-needed sunshine and fresh air, they knew the university was headed down the same disastrous path as the Catholic Church. Penn State couldn't play another football game with him as its coach, not a single down with his fellow scallywags facing criminal charges. The university couldn't go another day with nobody willing to do the difficult thing. Now the healing can begin. The guy who could have stopped Sandusky years ago is no longer the face of Penn State football.

Your system for handling sports clothing, says Schuneman, can be as simple as "two color-coded baskets by the back door or the laundry room: one for dirty, one for clean. Make it a habit to immediately put your uniforms in the dirty basket after the game," he says. "Once it's out of the wash, you fold it and put it in the clean basket," rather than putting it away with other clothing in a bedroom.

Since the late 1960s, free improvisation has often been associated with the negation of such supposedly mainstream musical values as melody, harmony, consonance, steady rhythm and discernible structure. But anybody who has listened seriously and deeply to the songlike tunes of Coleman and Albert Ayler, the modal muscularity of Coltrane, the funky drive and wistful lyricism of Davis and the internal architecture of pianists Evans, Jarrett and Kenny Werner understands the essential truth of a middle way, although any individual version of that path will take unique and personalized twists and turns.

• Future Arizona recruiting classes won’t be as far-flung -- Anthony Gimino, Tucson Citizen: The result Wednesday was a 25-player recruiting class that very much bears the Rodriguez brand.

Only six European nations - England, Germany, Netherlands, Slovakia, Portugal and Spain - made the second round, the fewest to advance off the continent since 1974, when six teams made it to an eight-team second round. In five of the past six World Cups, Europe has had 10 teams reach the round of 16.

Kunkle notes that Ohio was already losing younger workers at rapid pace before the Great Recession.
This week, the city had proposed a compromise route that started at Petrillo but then wound back into the Loop before heading south, Thayer said. Such a route would have accomplished some of the group’s demands for higher visibility, but Thayer said it added nearly a half-mile to the march and he feared they would exhaust the city’s 2 hour and 15 minute time limit on demonstrations and could be ordered to disperse before reaching McCormick Place.
"I want to take the Comeback Kid name away from the 100 other guys who had it and give it to him," Broncos receiver Eric Decker said.
A rap act as community-minded as this can't be 'net-rootless. They need a city to rhyme about. Since Tanya Morgan doesn't have one, they had to make one up. Brooklynati -- you see what they did there? -- is a hip-hop metropolis with a central park named after J. Dilla. The "Brooklynati" CD came with a fold-out map and the url of a website that barely mentions the band at all. They even made separate sites for Brooklynati's theater and Chinese food restaurant. The local radio station is called Cold98, but there are fewer in-jokes in Brooklynati than you'd think. They really want to generate the illusion that they come from an actual town -- and since they try so hard, and since they're good lyricists, they succeed just as well as rappers who want you to believe that they spend all day shooting people in the trap. And all of these imaginary traps start to sound the same after awhile. Brooklynati is its own distinct place, and one well worth visiting.
Smith said she tried to brake and put the car in neutral, but it would not stop for six miles. Eventually it slowed down on its own, she said. She looked at the pedals to make sure her foot was on the right one and didn't see a floor mat on the gas pedal, she said.

Elway also wants the team to win games now as he tries to put a title contender together. Put all of those things together and it's why the Broncos have chased Manning with such zeal.

How do you come back from a crushing loss to a team you’re supposed to manhandle with so much on the line? That was the question running through the Seton Hall (20-11) program in the last 48 hours before tip-off tonight against the Friars (21-11). All the Pirates had to do was beat DePaul and the turnaround from a Big East has-been to NCAA team would likely have been complete. Instead the Pirates watched an 86-58 beat-down at the hands of the Blue Demons.
It was fun seeing Dempsey, too, but he kept pushing me to try all the martinis. I managed to abstain -- being the teatotler you all know that I am -- because one kind of hangover is enough.
There was no Strickland-O-Meter because he was in the waning days of his governorship when PolitiFact Ohio began. But PolitiFact did rate several Strickland comments during the campaign -- and, in fact, its very first "false" rating was applied to him.
I fell in love with Quince the first time I had the sformato there; now I've developed another love affair with the spinach version at Cotogna, where the texture is as delicate as a poached egg. It doesn't matter if it's a pile of chicories with pomegranates and buratta, or chiccioli, a rough-textured house-made pate served with pickled vegetables and fried ravioli-shaped crackers - the kitchen never misses a step on the antipasti (all $10).
When the president visited the Intel plant in Chandler the day after his State of the Union address, he outlined how high-tech manufacturing in Arizona is making a comeback.

NEW YORK -- A surge in oil and the threat of a government shutdown weighed on stocks Friday.
In my mind, I no longer see my daughter tapping my hand with the torch. It's now someone I don't recognize, someone blurry and receding. Our memories are pliable, it seems, and I've revised mine without conscious effort to fit the known facts. But it was an unnerving way to get to the truth.

"I used to work here all the time," Cain says. "It started to feel too much like an office so I stopped coming up here. I thought I would get an office outside the home and I did, in North Portland, at Falcon Art Community, which is filled with artists. I thought, this is great, I'll go to work with other artists. I rented this space and had them paint it this incredibly brilliant blue. I thought if I had an office that was that blue I'd go there every day and write, but that didn't work. I've gone there like three times in the last four months. Somehow having an office that I had to go to made me want to work from home, which is easier to do if you don't have a boss waiting for you at the office, even a very blue office."
»Technology: Duke says the facility will convert coal into gas, which will be burned to produce electricity. The utility says the process will emit less sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury than the plant it will replace, while providing more than 10 times the power of the existing plant.

They'll be taking their bike once again on the AIDS LifeCycle ride in June, the seven-day, 545-mile fundraiser from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Last year, they pushed through technical problems of a broken seat, pedal and 13 spokes, but raised nearly $9,000 for the cause.
As Ringle says, Ariodante goes through a “gigantic roller coaster” ride in terms of both self-worth and position. He doesn’t initially believe himself worthy of Ginevra and is all too quick to take to heart the moment when he thinks he sees her with Polinesso.

To be fair, these particular agents were not part of the elite cadre that protects the president, and there is, as yet, no evidence other agents at other times engaged in the same sort of activity.

What high school sports mean to me: I think it's very fun, fun to go out with friends from school, but I also think it's something you need to work at — it can't always be a fun time.

Many in the media are purposely expediting the collapse of American culture with relentless observations on the differences in people's income. They directly and indirectly promote the idea that the government is there to take care of all, by controlling and redistributing personal income. The belief that a central-command government can control the general welfare is not only faulty economics but also personally self-destructive. Aside from the obvious intent of pitting one group against the other for political reasons, such news presentation clearly reveals anticapitalist bias and an unrealistic one-world view. World government is not compatible with human liberty.

Congress also can help. The Senate is now debating a food safety bill that would significantly overhaul the food safety system for the first time since 1938. It could grant the FDA broad authority to test for food-borne germs and strengthen its ability to trace outbreaks to the source.

The House passed the bill last year; the Senate is expected to vote on its version on Nov. 29.

Brown and Harrington sought to make honest, well-crafted varietal wines priced at less than $20 from Washington state. Substance produces as many as a dozen different wines, most in tiny quantities, all sold with an arresting black-and-white label design meant to reflect the periodic table of elements ("Sy" for Syrah, "Cs" for Cabernet Sauvignon). Brown is biased, naturally, but he believes that Washington fruit delivers a kind of elemental, varietal purity that's not only reliable, it's educational. "We wanted to be sure that if you're going to spend $20, you can expect to taste a varietal the way it's supposed to taste," Brown says.
The Stockholm partners, each with a design background, were shopping for an Ikea sofa last fall and "were really annoyed about the ugly legs," says Cagin.

In fact, knowing A&M had a penchant for such performances, Reliant officials should have installed seat belts in the stadium. (Of course, in following the Aggies' long-lived and longer-loathed little-brother status, the Texas A&M Cyclone is far less celebrated than the Texas Cyclone, which used to operate across the street at Astroworld.)

I'm not ready to write off Phil Hughes as a starter. But time is clearly running out, Hughes' viability as a starting pitcher has always boiled down to whether he can develop a swing-and-miss pitch. Sometimes, his curveball is good enough to be that pitch, but he lacks the neccessary consistency.

For Mr. Gingrich, it's his endless know-it-all posturing, sense of self-importance and grandiosity that, as Mr. Santorum might say, makes you want to throw up.

Practically speaking, each house in the city is - or will be - assigned a ranking of 1-4. Homes ranked with a 3 or a 4 meet or almost meet city housing code. Homes ranked with a 1 or a 2 are in need of some level of repair. In some cases, like the 41 4's in Lakewood, "demolition" wouldn't be out of the question, Siley added.

Spotting something of a fellow traveler in Mavis, who's far more damaged than he is, Matt sees right through her. He tells her that Buddy is a happy man with a great home life; this is true. But no, Mavis protests. She and Buddy are meant to be together, fate will work things out. Her delusions are breathtaking. Yet she soldiers on, unaware and unconcerned about the damage she causes. It's not pretty, and at times it's hard to watch.

The Best Man is filled with stereotypes - they also include Lansbury as a leader of "the women's division" of the party in Pennsylvania in the last days of do-gooder females who are not themselves running for office; Mays as a shy but determined whistle-blower; and McKean as an all-around crafty but sensible campaign manager. All the stereotypes work because, like many generalizations, they are built on the stuff of truth - material that Vidal efficiently manipulates.

Ray Ratto, CBSSports.com: "With the offerings of the now absurdly-named Metta World Peace (to James Harden) and Jimmy Hayes (To Michal Rozsival in last night's Phoenix-Chicago Stanley Cup game) as new evidence, it is clear that gentle ideas like ‘respect your opponent' and ‘worker solidarity' and even ‘don't be a jackass' are failing. That means technology must go where conscience, rules-making and punishment will not, and we're all pretty much exhausted with the head-shot fetish anyway, so here it is. The spiked helmet. And not just the old Prussian orange-juicer on the top, either. A helmet with a series of pointed spikes, like a Mad Max sunburst for the head. You want to go upstairs with malicious intent now, you come back with the nickname ‘Stumpy.'"
Mike Saccone, spokesman for Attorney General John Suthers, said lawyers are still reviewing the amendment. There are concerns, he said, because the bill's probable cause standard is more stringent than the "reason to believe" test the office usually applies.

Maybe Crofton, who never cared much about the celebrity-chef quest (though she can cook with any of them) was a victim of her own low-key nature. Perhaps prices, which admittedly were on the higher end (but well in line with the quality of the food), were still too high in today's market. Certainly losing its one Michelin star (awarded in 2010, removed in 2011) didn't help.

But remember, I'm a sap. The White House clearly has decided that in a town of intransigent Republicans and mean ideologues, it has to be mean and intransigent too. The president was stung by the liberal charge that he was outmaneuvered during the debt-ceiling fight. So the White House has moved away from the Reasonable Man approach or the centrist Clinton approach.
How does the campaign deal with people who point out the awkward reality that all of the "Obama" job losses took place before any Obama policies had taken effect? The fallback argument - which was rolled out when reporters asked about the factory closure - is that even though Mr. Obama inherited a deeply troubled economy, he should have fixed it by now. That factory is still closed, said a Romney adviser, because of the failure of Obama policies "to really get this economy going again."

President Obama is right to look to Cleveland as he continues to chart our nation's economic comeback. Northeast Ohio is home to cutting-edge research and development, innovative small businesses and a rich history of entrepreneurialism.

The somberness of this episode (as well as Jack getting beat up), makes the viewer, and Emily, wonder “How far am I willing to go?” Even she finally seems to be hearing what Nolan has been telling her all along, and the episode had an eerie sense of series ending. But just as Emily is ready to back off, Victoria re-digs her grave by giving the impression that David Clarke had raped her, and not that a torrid love affair had occurred. I can’t tell if this was Victoria’s initial intent, but it works out quite well for her.

Going over by 10% to 15% draws a 100% tax plus the loss of first- and second-round picks the next year. Any team over by 15% or more is taxed at 100% and loses its top two picks in the next two drafts.

Trend that must die: Bacon madness. The year began with online chatter about a monstrous dish with the unsettling name "Bacon Explosion" (bacon wrapped in sausage, then encased in a weave of bacon strips).

Yes, bacon is glorious, but do we really need a bacon martini? No.
