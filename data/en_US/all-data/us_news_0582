The transition from teen-pop favorite to adult hit-maker is tricky, as is the move from a genre style to a more personal one. Swift is trying to do both at once, and if she stumbles from time to time, we should still be amazed at how gracefully she is handling her maturation in the spotlight.

We were lucky to see one of the 23 black rhinos, though it was a distance away. After spending our days looking for the "big five" - leopard, lion, cape buffalo, rhino, and elephant - we were thankful for a hot shower, drinks in the lounge and wonderful food with our new friends.

MedWorks sponsors free health clinics in the Cleveland area for the under- and uninsured, regardless of where they live, how much they earn or their citizenship.
There's pleasure to be found in the resolute offbeatness of "Henry's Crime." It's nearly as concerned with the play as it is with the heist (and with drawing parallels between the two). And the relentless Buffalo gloom is a strange counterpoint to the mostly light character interplay and quirky-indie score; Reeves' blankness is generally well-used here, and Caan's character is amusing for really not caring if he goes back to prison or not.
By the time “Out of Africa” came around, Kael had had enough of the foreign accents. But her biggest gripe with Streep in this sweeping epic — and the cornerstone of her critique of Streep's acting — is that “her character doesn't deepen” or “come to mean more to us.”
There are plenty of reasons to revive a classic musical, be it audience familiarity, high quality of the work or just a plain, old fashioned cash-grab.
I've noticed that in several of your films, including this one and "The Eagle" and "The Last King of Scotland," oppressed people fight back against their occupiers. Yes, I suppose that comes with being a Scot.

INCHING TOWARD SPRING: There is nothing about the weather that would make you think spring, but if you measure the nearness of spring by sports calendars, we are almost there. College spring sports are within days of launching their spring seasons. At Jefferson College, the baseball team will get going next weekend with a three-day outing to Meridian (Miss.) C.C., while the softball team drags its spikes a bit and sets opening day as March 1. ... The Vikings softball team recently picked its captains for the spring season: sophomores Gina Melton from Crystal City and Kendra Dering from Ava and freshmen Sarah Krysl from Hillsboro and Steph Price from McCluer.

But this instance is different because of a specific line of Maryland law, and as a result, Mr. Schurick's character is ultimately irrelevant to the decision the jury must make. The law says that a person may not "willfully and knowingly ... influence or attempt to influence a voter's decision whether to go to the polls to cast a vote through the use of force, fraud, threat, menace, intimidation, bribery, reward, or offer of reward." That leaves two basic questions. Did Mr. Schurick authorize the robocall and know what it contained? And did the call amount to a fraudulent attempt to keep voters from the polls?

The next few days, more patients died and still more fell ill. Ms. Ruksana was now one of three of Dr. Desai's patients suffering from mysterious, severe postoperative complications. Dr. Desai gave Mr. Arif a grim update one afternoon. "Her condition is very critical. We're failing to understand why we can't stop the bleeding."
Everything about the place seemed like a rocker's paradise with its party-like vibe and slightly inebriated patrons. The grounds even include a music-recording studio where Sean Yseult of White Zombie fame recently recorded with her new group, Star & Dagger.
The dominant story last year was Verlander. The dominant story this year, at least early, will probably be Fielder -- even if Cabrera has a better year. Fielder is new, he has Detroit connections, and is naturally more comfortable mingling with fans than Cabrera and Verlander.

It marks just the second time since the federal police-reform act was passed in 1994 that the Justice Department has been forced to file a contested lawsuit against a law-enforcement agency, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez said.
Of the nearly 600,000 visitors who attend the Budapest Christmas market at Vorosmarty Square each year, 30 to 40 percent are foreigners, according to Molnar. That means revenue for hotels, restaurants and other segments of the travel industry in addition to income for the vendors and the markets.

"If you belong to one group you'll need one therapy, and if you're in another you'll need another," said Dr. Carlos Caldas, a breast cancer geneticist at the University of Cambridge in England who helped oversee the research.

These days, PM Dawn is fully recuperated. The first two albums (at least) are remembered as classics of decorative production and abstract rhyme. But I believe that the initial ferocious resistance to PM Dawn took a heavy toll on the Cordes brothers. Prince Be suffered two strokes in the last six years, and had to have his foot amputated. Minutemix keeps threatening to release new music, but never does. Of all the great rap acts of the late '80s, PM Dawn might be the least likely to mount a comeback. So we're left with the music the pair made when all their faculties were intact; luckily, those recordings are so rich and deep that they ought to keep us floating for years to come.

Besides overseeing operations at Fort McHenry and Hampton, Cappetta Orcutt has begun to meet with local leaders in tourism and other areas. She said it's a pleasure to take command of a park service property that has as much public support as Fort McHenry, because that's not always the case.
But there was still another character that Marilyn embodied — and although she couldn’t play it in real life, she lived it, brilliantly, through her movies. Because what really made Monroe so appealing was that the love she projected on-screen wasn’t carnal at all.
In Denver, perhaps, they tell a different story, because that is where Wright played professional football and basketball. And perhaps they differ in South Broad Valley, where he turned the trophy case at Shabazz High School into an overstocked hardware department when it was known as Newark South Side in his day.
"Fort Nightly," their stunning 2007 debut, earned raves from Pitchfork, Village Voice and Q, which praised their "gift for the surreal." When second album, "It's Frightening," produced by Britt Daniel of Spoon, arrived in 2009, it only reinforced their growing stack of glowing press, kicking off with a beat that could just about pass for Adam and the Ants. A third album, "Milk Famous," hits the streets Tuesday, March 6.
Pro-choice as he may be, Giuliani told the VVs that he wants America to become "a country without abortion." This takes Giuliani well beyond the triangulating formula used by Bill Clinton: that abortions should be "safe, legal and rare." In its absolutism, moreover, it recalls the absurd aspiration of a "drug-free America." True, Giuliani said he would obliterate abortions by "changing the minds and hearts of people," but then he offered a laundry list of governmental actions to limit the procedure.
2006 Teira Zinfandel, Sonoma County, Calif. ($13-$15) - Love this Zinfandel because it has all the spice, fruit and power without the giant alcohol that normally comes with Zins.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the name of the new exchange remains a concern. In a statement released after the merger was announced, Schumer said there was no reason NYSE "shouldn't come first in the new exchange's name." He also seemed to issue a veiled threat. Any name that puts NYSE second "could have negative consequences" for the merger.

"Dwek has been extremely helpful in the bankruptcy case," said Stanziale. "Without his assistance, a lot of information — which is not documented — would have been close to impossible to locate. That has enabled the estate to pursue litigation for the return of tens of millions of dollars."

"Free money" - Ads promising free money from the IRS have been appearing in churches nationwide, the IRS says.

The three indicators that limited the rise in the index were average weekly hours worked by manufacturing employees, consumer expectations for business conditions and the Institute for Supply Management's measure of manufacturers' new orders.

A quarter-century ago, Nicklaus became the most popular winner of the Masters ever. At 46, with thunderclaps of cheers spurring him on through the back nine on Masters Sunday, he won his 18th and last professional major. Babe Ruth, it was said, had hit another home run.
Knightly figures he started collecting Jordan Brand shoes when he was 14 years old, saving money from mowing lawns and other odd jobs. He estimates he has about 40 pairs of shoes.

Victims' families argue that costs should not drive the death penalty debate. That focus angers Barbara Christian, the mother of Terri Winchell, a 17-year-old Lodi girl murdered 31 years ago.

A chronic upset stomach caused Frater to drop 20 pounds over the last two months. His weight is still dropping, he said.

New World wine is admittedly close to being a complete food and, hence, delicious by itself. Low acidity, gobs of flavor and extract, even a dollop of booze, all make for a nice beverage, if you will, especially as a prelude to — and not necessarily a component of — a meal.
Sanofi-Aventis shares rose on the announcement, and in mid-afternoon trading Paris time were up 3.5 percent at euro51.56. In U.S. premarket trading, Genzyme stock rose $1.22 to $75.52.

America is embarrassingly obese, and it begins with our children. As the article indicates, a third of our country's children are overweight or obese. Therefore, a new policy has been added to the purpose of the CNA: curbing obesity. The problem is that Congress is too focused on changes to nutritional guidelines. Rather, it should become aware that eating in moderation is the key, too. Eating too much food, even if it is healthy, can be a catalyst to obesity. Unfortunately, children eat more than they need to; and, it is due to a lack of control and nutritional education. A policy to educate and control how much a student should eat would have significant effects, including healthier students, efficient use of American tax dollars, and less obesity in America.
If it survives the state Senate and becomes law, Illinois would join California, which last year imposed the nation's only statewide ban.
Hey, Hoynsie: Do you feel that the reasoning behind no guaranteed contracts after 2012 for the Indians is because Larry and Paul Dolan are finally holding the front office accountable? Might they finally clean house if they don't make the playoffs? -- Walter R. Pritchard, Painesville

Government attorneys can — and likely will — ask the full 11th Circuit to review the panel's ruling. They also can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which many legal observers expect to have the final say on the issue.
Instead, the play is being made to keep Atlantic City a major destination resort and in fact expand its entertainment and amusement offerings. The report calls for the revival of the city’s convention business, which has gotten little promotional assistance. Criticizing a generation of underinvestment in non-gaming activities, it also suggests adding family type amusement rides on the boardwalk, and possibly the addition of a NASCAR track.

Tomorrow is St. Thomas Sunday on the church calendar. Last year was the first time I realized that there was such a day. I was immediately glad about it, though, since Thomas is my favorite disciple. In services tomorrow countless churches will be reading the story of Thomas's post-resurrection encounter with the Lord. It's what he's best known for and the reason that his nickname is Doubting Thomas. In the Sunday school class I teach we'll reflect on the role of doubt in the spiritual journey: is it a necessary evil, a sign of weakness, or a means through which we grow? It's an important subject, but doubting is not all there is to Thomas.

Rye is deceptively small. I didn't notice until I was halfway done with my cocktail that there is a back room that's more intimate than the otherwise busy front. It is in this room that Rye's fascination with vintage is most conspicuous. At Max's, old junk is turned into clever installations; at Rye, they've been lovingly restored into set pieces — a pristine set of antique silverware hangs on one wall; a dilapidated candelabrum covered in melted wax fills out a fireplace.

For me, the sweetest moments in "Little Voice" were the quieter ones during which LV connects with the similarly shy Billy (Sean McGettigan), the telephone installer's assistant, whose passions are electricity and lighting. My favorite scene found this timid Tesla, flashlight in hand, talking to LV outside her bedroom window. The laughs came not from comic mugging but from the awkward interaction of two lost souls who have finally found each other.

Q: We have large pottery incorporated throughout our landscaping. Most of the pots get plenty of sun. However, one large pot in our entry courtyard gets very little direct sunlight. We planted elephant's food there as well as in several of the outside pots, having been told by our nursery that it does well in both sunny and shaded areas. The elephant's food plants have done extremely well in sunny areas. The courtyard plants did OK for a little over a year, but they are no longer doing well. Several plants have lost many of their leaves. We've recently started cutting those back. Do you think this is a case of not enough sunlight or perhaps over watering? We've tried to be careful about that.

A third one is in the area of health care. We need to find ways to bend the cost curve for both public and private sectors of health care.

The kitchen even finds a way to brighten chicken, rice and dumpling soup ($6.50). The broth is more like a refined jook, with three handkerchief-shaped chicken dumplings set in the center of the bowl. It creates a wonderful textural contrast between the silky soup and the dumpling's crisp exterior.
The other thing is, YouTube is wonderful and I love it and I think it's great that it leveled the playing field. But it also means that I'll never be the only person and certainly never the first person to do a parody of any given hit song.

Soup or salad is included with each entrée, so we tried the cream of mushroom and potato-tomato soups and New England clam chowder, $2.95 each when ordered a la carte.

Search protocols vary between international airports. Certain guidelines, such as restrictions on liquids, tend to be universal, but security rules differ on a country-by-country basis.
In these below-the-radar races, special interests such as unions and environmental groups can make a big difference. They dangle campaign cash and endorsements to the most sympathetic candidates, particularly ones that have some record of working with them. Critics say the result is that Portland produces too many legislators with rigidly liberal views who are often unwilling to meet other legislators in the middle.
Stieber won the 133-pound Big Ten title as the No. 1 seed March 4 in West Lafayette, Ind. Stieber beat No. 2 seed Tony Ramos of Iowa, 5-2, in the final and was later named Big Ten Freshman of the Year.

The pretrial report in a Harris County juvenile court involved a B student caught with a Xanax at his high school. The kid has never been in trouble before. Last week, Gary Polland read the report aloud to me in his signature rapid-fire delivery and pronounced: "This case should be dismissed. And what did it takes us to figure that out? Ninety seconds?"
That change could be the toughest nut to crack, however, because the current system provides a powerful political tool to the presiding officers of both the state Senate and House of Delegates.

"I like the attention the coaches and the instructors in the classrooms paid to the individuals," Osoro said. "It is already one of the best cross-country programs in the nation and I want to be part of that tradition."
I've always loved Robert Frost's line about home being the place where, "when you have to go there, they have to take you in." Perhaps I'm putting an overly optimistic reading on it, but the idea that even on our coldest, darkest nights, there is always a place with a warm light in the window is reassuring. That's kind of the way I feel about having eggs in the refrigerator.
But because division winners are guaranteed the top three seeds in each conference, the runners-up in the Atlantic are likely to meet in a fratricidal opening best-of-seven that will be depleting at the least and barring multiple upsets will leave the survivor to play a top seed in round two.

But I wouldn't say that the vice presidential race doesn't matter -- after all, one of them is going to end up one bullet or heart attack away from the nuclear football. I concede, of course, that Americans don't really care much about the issue. Vice presidential candidates are, to borrow a phrase from you, Ezra, the earrings of a campaign. But it seems to me that we should care.

The 39-year-old fund manager isn't talking. He declined to comment through his assistant.
Bergstrom and outside linebacker Miles Burris, the team's fourth-round pick, would seem like the two players who could make a push for some serious playing time. Burris would set up on the line of scrimmage at San Diego State and attack, and will have to work on his pass-coverage, but he has the explosive twitch that coaches want in defensive players.
Columbia junior Bryce Bastien hit a long three at the first-quarter buzzer, then scored the first basket of the second to put the Eagles up 10-6. The Oilers soon surged ahead and held the lead until Columbia tied it late in regulation before going in front 37-36 early in the first overtime.

Because, if I make it personal, I can never really be absolutely certain if I've done all the "right" things that could be done in any given situation. Only hindsight is 20/20. And so we spend a good part of our lives doing the best we can with what we know, hoping for the best to prevail.

Row covers and cloches laid over the plants keep them basking even on overcast days. The covers of spun or woven fabric hold in heat, obstruct cold and insects, and allow sun and rain through. Anchor the edges so the wind doesn't blow the covers away, leaving enough slack so the basil can raise the cover as it grows. To make cloches out of old wood or metal windows, lay one on top of the other and fasten them together using heavy-duty hinges, then splay them out to form a lean-to shelter. While these cloches can be heavy, their weight prevents them from being blown over.
"Absolutely, I'm impressed. It's over the top. It's too easy to sit here and say we expected it — no we didn't. We thought it was going to be a long road. We've got a long way to go, but we're moving in the right direction at a pretty good pace."

The Broncos traded back into the first round of the 2010 draft to pick Tebow, a move that surprised many around the league who had projected Tebow as a second-round pick or lower. Few teams, after watching Tebow's first two years in Denver, would likely want to give back the value the team first spent to get him.

The district will lay off more than 500 at the end of this school year and plans to have more than 200 take a retirement incentive, bringing the total reduction to around 700. The 508 teaching positions will be cut mostly from kindergarten through eighth grade, but less-experienced high school teachers are included in the layoffs because more-experienced elementary teachers also certified for high school can claim those jobs.
