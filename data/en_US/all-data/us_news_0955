There's another reason why this may turn out to be a good fit: Cignetti's personality. He's animated, energetic, and fairly aggressive. Why does that matter? Rams head coach Jeff Fisher is excited by Bradford's talent, but wants to see the young QB develop more of a take-charge personality. And that includes raising hell with the coaches if they're calling stupid plays or failing to make necessary adjustments. Bradford needs to come out of his shell a bit more. Cignetti seemingly has the kind of personality that can draw out the fiery side of Bradford's demeanor. Longtime NFL assistant Rick Venturi, now with radio station 101 ESPN in St. Louis, formed a positive impression of Cignetti when they were on the New Orleans' staff in 2000-2001. And Venturi believes Cignetti will be right for Bradford.

Today, Adams' chief of staff, Tom Miller, explained the difference between the two statements. Yes, Adams wanted to include bridge transfers as part of the Sellwood negotiations.

Native plants have robust root systems that penetrate deep into the soil, which allows pathways as deep as 6 to 8 to 10 feet. And they create a habitat for other native species, which is birds, butterflies, bees and so on."

Reza has expressed frustration that her popular plays have been delivered as razor-sharp comedies, and she seems to have found an ally in Polanski, who makes no effort to punch up the wry ironies of the dialogue. That is probably for the best -- comedy does not play the same on the screen as it does the stage. But if anything, "Carnage" does too little to adapt to the new medium, and the result is a film that makes its audience feel as trapped as its characters.

She's bartended for 12 years -- even while working as an interior designer by day for the last 8 years. Why continue to pour? "I love the Wednesday blues nights at the Parkview," she says. "It's one of the funnest nights of the week in Cleveland." Fun, in part, because of her sense of humor and happy-go-lucky attitude, say patrons.

If you buy a full-sized Android tablet you're shunning the only comprehensive library of slate-optimized apps and the safest, most stable mobile OS in the world.
