I don't worry much about my son's learning. I trust that being around me and my incessant reading and thinking will be enough to help him move forward in most ways. I do regret that I'm not more musical - he'd blossom with a musical adult quietly mentoring his amazing musicality.
As I began to analyze what this could mean, it all just kind of started unfolding in my mind. God wants to be our source for everything. He wants to be our source of happiness, our source of confidence, our source of strength, our source of love, our source of acceptance, our source of peace. He wants to be the thought that wakes us up in the morning, and the thought that lays us down to rest. He wants to be on our minds and in our hearts all the time to keep us feeling fulfilled, and whole in Him. When you think of all of the ways that this can be applicable to us, it's almost mind blowing.
Since I do have these expenses, what’s in my dwindling bank account has to last me for a while. At the same time, I get sick of my clothes and want some new tops or dresses, especially since I feel like I’m wearing the exact same outfit several times a month.
Some recent Australian highlights have been a range of wines from Grant Burge – whose sensational Barossa Valley wines should be more widely celebrated – and unearthing a bottle of 1992 Lindemans Limestone Ridge Coonawarra Shiraz-Cabernet. This had been sleeping in my wine rack and had developed more complexity than I would ever have imagined. Interstingly the current vintage, 2008, has 14.5% alcohol – whereas my 1992 came in at just 12.5%.

I confess that I always imagined having a daughter, but I am so thankful to have sons. Although many women idealize mother-daughter relationships, I've observed that in many cases, these relationships can be strained or not meet expectations. Daughters can be very hard on their mothers.
what a price to pay
Children's fiction? Okay, so they're not super-academic and complex like "real" fiction. However, to draw emotion from a child is a totally unique challenge; it's not easy to write so simply and still work the imagination and create beauty. I seriously doubt Verne or Twain could just sit down and write a really good children's book. In contrast, Dr. Seuss is an incredible children's poet/writer. No, he doesn't write like Crane or Rilke! In his own right, though, he is a great artist.
I feel like those toys you had, when you were a kid, a little creature on a spring, that you push down and it sits and after a few minutes the spring unwinds and suddenly the little creature goes POP and springs into the air and bounces away.
On my eyes, he used Dark Rite, Demon Lover and Ashes to Ashes, while on my lips he used Sweet Revenge. That sounds like one seriously evil recipe for one little face.

Yesterday was different. We visited the Morgan car factory - a 2-hour tour that anyone can take, but this was organised by TCAS as part of the 'Escape to the Hills' weekend. What always fascinates me when on such an outing is looking behind the scenes, the organisation, the attention to detail in so many aspects of a company. This post will not be a 'write-up' of Morgan - a British-owned, family-run firm since 1905, every beautiful car put together by hand, skilled workforce using hand-tools - just a gallery of the snapshots I was able to take as we walked from one dedicated workshop to another. I won't even caption the photos, for I cannot pretend to understand the technical aspects; hopefully such shots as I was able to take will speak for themselves. Words fail me for once - though I could research it if I needed to; most of the time I couldn't hear the tour guide anyway, for I lagged behind aiming for photos that showed the workmanship and not the backs of strangers!
(Note: For this reason, I am adding on my goodreads page shelves for books I own and books I want.)
Well, I think I’ve learned more from this experience than you. I don’t have many friends who have children, those that do live far away from us. You sometimes have Dylan over to play, he lives a couple of doors down from us … or there’s Chloe and Natasha who have kids and you sometimes play with them.
This grey horse was the exception to the (first) rule. He is a young quarter horse stallion and a beauty to watch, he was also a perfect gentleman. Could show in the show arena with other horses and mares, and stand quietly in cross ties with other horses close by. I was most impressed by his white eyelashes and dark eyes, he stole my heart and I enjoyed watching his owner show him this year. And of course I had to have some pictures, in case I decided to paint him.
Oh, I'm going to be in trouble for those.
If it starts to bother him in the future, we'll look into treatments.

Some people are frightened of love, because, when it appears, it demolishes all the old things it finds in its path.No one wants their life thrown into chaos. This is why a lot of people keep that threat under control, and are somehow capable of sustaining a life or a structural body, that is already rotten with in,without love.

The bridge was closed to road traffic in February 2005 to allow essential maintenance to ensure the bridge's long-term future, including replacement of wooden supports beneath the road deck. It was expected to reopen in late-2005, however, the reopening has now slipped as severe cracks were found in some of the bridge's iron girders. Having assessed the bridge, engineers have decided a crash barrier on each side of the roadway is necessary, meaning that there will be space for only one lane of traffic when the bridge reopens.
Neesa just stared out into space, taking in the view. She was mesmerized by the form of the Basestars, like sleek and monstrous starfish, the streaking plumes of hundreds of missiles, the explosions all about her...a symphony of destruction.

The history in the book is, in places, poor, if it allows the author to make a political point. When I catch an author with historical errors, I wonder where else she’s shaded things to get her message across. In the book you don’t just get old saws like “Victorians covered the legs of their furniture for sexual modesty.” you also get things which are easily checked and are simply wrong.
I’ll admit I’m biased towards these guys – I picked up a pair of $400 boots from them last year. But as one of my best friends said, “Got that italian leather!” These boots are hand stitched just south of the border in Mexico and the quality shows. I’ve never owned an article of clothing with that much detail in the stitching – I’ll let the boots themselves do the talking.
I for one am terribly anticipating Book 3. Please, please don’t call it ‘Ever’.
The Obituary Writer by Porter Shreve is in a word: Quirky. Gordon Hatch is the son of a supposedly famous newspaper reporter who had bylines on tons of articles following the Kennedy assassination. However, Charlie Hatch died when Gordon when just a young boy, so everything he knows about his father comes directly from his mother. After hearing so many wonderful things, it’s only natural for a son to dream about picking up where his father left off.
The thing about the dialogue I'm quoting above is that on one level Walken is talking to himself inside a spaceship near his upstate NY vacation home, but the other self is a version wearing eye-liner who presumably is an alien intelligence talking to him in the form of yet another mask. It becomes difficult to tell which version of him is really the dreamer and which the dreamed and I think that's no accident of bad editing, but a point about aliens impossible to make in any 'easier' way.

The odd thing about this episode is that the film he made, about a Ugandan warlord, was a huge success. It quickly went viral after being released on the internet, which attracted the attention of occupational trolls who cruise cyberspace looking for victims to harass. Poor Jason must be unusually thin-skinned for a movie director. He should have told them to stick raw chillies up their butt-holes. That's what Alfred Hitchcock would have done.

Thanks to the nature and strength of the Indian democracy Ms.Banerjee’s government is bound to last only the one term. But where must the citizens of West Bengal look to for leadership and reform? Apart from the Trinamool Congress only the Left commands enough votes to form a government. The electorate is thus left to choose between the devil and the deep sea and one can only hope that another alternative emerges for Tagore’s homeland.

How are you to have a convincing villain if your “hero” acts all nonchalant about offing a random person? I’ll tell you. You get William Forsythe to act ridiculously over the top from the get-go. And that’s exactly what we get. Forsythe’s character happens to be blocking traffic and a random women who’s trying to get by says “Move your damn car.” His reaction is to get out of his car and shoot her in the head. Clearly this is what director John Flynn felt they had to show so the villain could be seen as a threat to the hero.

The look? Clear vases, each holding one white ranunculus are suspended in air by clear fishing line. Don't you just love how the beauty of the flower just stands (or floats) on its own? A runner's length of white florals and candles along the table compliment the florals from above. Repeated through, the look, quite simply is awe inspiring.

Third, when you see a diseased leaf in the garden you can pick it off and destroy it. Make sure if you use tools on infected plants to wash them off afterward. Most people will recommend that you use a 10% bleach solution to sterilize them. If you don't, you will just be spreading the disease around the garden.

After being recently reminded that I have failed to update my blog in a while, I decided that it is due time for an update. I went to America after being in Guatemala for 10 months and that was quite the trip. I originally planned to stay for 5 days for my brothers HS graduation, but after the tropical storm Agatha hit, and the Volcano Pacaya erupted within days of each other, the airport in Guatemala City closed for 5 days. So, I was gifted with an extra 7 days to enjoy our great nation. I got to spend some time in Dallas getting to know Chris' family better and we both traveled to San Diego to visit the guys of Hug it Forward, a non-profit organization dedicated to bettering our world and building bottle schools in Guatemala. We spent a wonderful few days at the beach, and I got to go to a yoga class, which I have been missing dearly.
Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.” And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
The 17U Q6 All-Stars, an AAU team out of Florida, have had an impressive start to their early season with a 9-3 record after playing in three events. Two of those losses were a tough pill to swallow, losing to the Southern Stampede in a four overtime game and losing to the fourth ranked Houston Defenders by six. They finished 3-1 at the Knoxvegas Invitational after taking a loss to the eventual winners of the tournament, Southern Stampede, in the Elite 8. At the Big Shots tournament in Clemson, Q6 finished with a 2-1 record; their only loss coming to the Smyrna Stars. Q6 also played at the Real Deal In The Rock tournament over the weekend, where they made it to the Elite 8 before losing to the Houston Defenders by six.

It is of course a huge beer and has the consistency of motor oil. With only 40 IBUs, the flavors are mostly on the sweet side; balance comes mainly from alcohol, which warms the mouth and belly upon contact. Like a very rich, liquid dessert, you can't drink a great deal of this beer--8 ounces is probably my outer limit. It's a potion to be sipped slowly, attentively. (Why do breweries always sell these things in 22s? Without friends, you're doomed.)
I urge you to read the article and determine for yourself what was done and what should be done. While you are at it, I would suggest you also look at the reporting on the Blagojevich trial that starts today in Chicago about how Blago allegedly attempted to sell Barack Hussein Obama’s Senate seat when he resigned. Obama says he was not involved but you may wonder when you see some of the players and realize that Obama has refused to appear at the trial!
Hearts manager Paulo Sergio made some changes with David Templeton and Rudi Skacel coming in to give the team some much needed width. Just four minutes had gone when the hugely impressive Ryan Stevenson was left unmarked in the Celtic penalty area and the former Ayr United man's header was saved by Forster. Marius Zaliukas then hit the post with a shot from the edge of the penalty box as Hearts began to believe in themselves. However, Celtic should have taken the lead after 20 minutes but Bangura's header was not strong enough to beat Hearts keeper Jamie MacDonald.
For now, I would like to share with you a cassette from 1991 (the year in which A.T.T. overtrew Moussa Traoré), bought in Mopti (the town where A.T.T. was born), and recorded by one of my favourites "vendeurs de cassettes" in the local market: Amadou Fofana (more of his cassettes in future posts). The subject of the cassette is A.T.T. himself. And I have no doubt the song is in praise of the man.
I just love waking up in my bedroom and seeing the chandelier in all it's glory right above our bed. I'd found it so long ago I can't remember where. It was a part or my dreams for my next home that I waited so long for that i can't believe I finally get to enjoy so many of my dreams.

As I’ve mentioned before (see “An Appointment with Jesus,” http://elenedom.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/an-appointment-with-jesus/ ), the most confusing and problematic encounters I’ve experienced have been with an entity who purports to be Jesus. It seems disrespectful to describe him that way, but I have exactly that “highly skeptical” feeling that Mike Tymn was talking about. I’ve never gotten used to the idea of talking directly with Jesus, especially given my severe allergy to organized religion, and I still feel embarrassed and uncomfortable bringing it up here. Yet, I must say that these contacts have been absolutely wonderful, and in the midst of them, I felt completely willing to throw myself into the experience. I can’t say precisely that I was willing to believe, but I was willing to be open and to listen and learn.
While there are many good reasons to participate as a pilot in this project, it appears that there is limited enthusiasm among right-holders to participate. This may be due to the novelty of the approach as well as fears relating to the protection of confidential business information. Since the methodology proposed by Rand has been applied in other areas, applying economic theory to solve social and legal problems is one of its specialities, scepticism as to the methodology—although understandable because of the unusual starting-point—is not constructive for as long as it is not tested in practice. A dry-run does not tell us whether the methodology will hold water: only the actual testing of the model will allow confirmation that the Rand methodology is appropriate, whether it requires adjustment, or whether an alternative should be envisaged.

This part was quite easy, because I was working with “Atari” kind of graphics. So, I used rectangles for bricks, two rectangles for the pallete, and a roundish tiny square for the ball. Not complicated at all. I used separated files for each, I could have done with a huge bmp/PNG strip, but I didn’t, I think it was a waste of time because game wasn’t that big anyway and memory and CPU wasn’t really a serious issue.

In any event, we knew there had to be a new "bigger" venue for "bigger" boys this year. Since we start planning our parties a year in advance, I casually mentioned to Carson (a long time ago) our idea about moving the party. At that time, he seemed fine with it. In fact, I thought a private pool party in June would be perfect. We also talked about having a Nebraska football party for the theme which he was fine with too.

I especially like the dresses (not sure if you can catch the silver and gold undertones in the fabric; if not, visit Shabby Apple for close-up views). I would throw a skinny gold belt on the dress with longer sleeves and would wear either to a fancy New Year's Eve event. Thoughts?

In a statement on their website, the Little Soldiers have this message:
Add 6" of very heavy, wet snow to trees that are still completely full of leaves, just beginning their color changes, and you have a disaster on your hands. Trees that just hours before stood tall and proud, were bent, broken and some completely toppled under the weight. Those same weighted limbs came down on power and telephone lines, effectively crippling dozens of towns and plunged millions into the dark.
Last week, Pizza Hut released a pizza that has hotdog stuffed right into the crust.

The plumeria are in the same room and are getting the benefit of the lights and the humidifier. I hope they bloom this summer!

While the program proceeded at first with some simplified explanations, soon there began a series of fascinating details and considerations. What would be the effect of eating fish and seaweed from near the reactors for a year?--not as much as we'd think (for instance a possible dose of 1/4th of normal background radiation! -- see NEI 4/4 update in blue beneath my own updates). One of the highlights was a discussion really about the town that has gotten one of the denser falls of radiation just NW of the expanded evacuation zone. An amazing graphic came up -- a figure representing what level of radiation exposure might be...politically? socially? healthwise? um, tolerated, you might say...before evacuating more land. The graphic showed an actual number for cancer risk at the high end of its scale -- 100 milli-Sieverts (mSv) is expected to increase one's cancer risk (above the existing level) by 0.5%. 10mSv is thought to have little discernible effect (try telling that to people afraid of drinking milk that had magnitudes less). 50 mSv is thought to indicate evacuation.

This account concerns the younger of the two brothers: George Watkins Holden was born on 3 September 1846 at Peckham in Surrey and baptised on 15 November at Christchurch, Camberwell. Although his brother was born two years earlier at Albany Terrace, Claines, Worcestershire, both were illegitimate sons of Emma Holden (1817-1887), and most likely fathered by the Welsh Liberal politician and Lord Lieutenant of Brecon, militia Colonel John Lloyd Vaughan Watkins (1802-1865). Watkins may well have provided for his mistress and her children - the 1851 Census shows them visiting a house in King Street, Laugharn, Carmarthenshire, and Emma is described as an annuitant.

“GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka” tells the story of a former bōsōzoku member who became a teacher at a private school.

As the students did their best to kicked him out of school, Onizuka tries his best to reformed them.
The other hallfling rogue, who called himself Bud, was the first to react. Pushing others out of his way, he proudly proclaimed for the others to watch and “see how it was done.” He then gets the rope and with a heave, leaps off into space. Unfortunately (and due to very terrible die rolling, hello natural 1) his hands immediately begin slipping and as he is over the mid point of the stream, the end of the rope slips through his sweaty little palms, dropping him into the drink. He makles no splash.
I grew up with my father telling me that happiness is a choice. He didn’t mean like a choice between eating cereal or oatmeal for breakfast. He meant like the choice between cheating on your spouse with someone you’re attracted to at the office or choosing to be faithful to your spouse and reinvent your marriage. He meant that happiness is a choice that you decide upon by fighting for it. His words have stuck with me because he shared with me how hard he has been fighting for happiness all of his life. Because he told me how many times he almost lost and almost lost his life in the process.

KABUL, Afghanistan — A series of blasts have gone off in a neighborhood of the Afghan capital that is home to embassies and a NATO forces base. Sunday's explosions were followed by gunshots. The site of the blast was not immediately clear. Sirens could be heard through the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood. Pedestrians in the streets took cover as shooting continued.

Fast forward to the early morning....All the kids were snuggled in their beds and Jon and I were snoring away peacefully when my phone rang. It was the school. They finally caved and called school off! Yippie!!! I could sleep in. I was so happy! Next thing I know, my phone is going off AGAIN! Only this time it was the alarm I had set to get up. Dang it! I wanted to sleep in. I hit snooze. Drift off to sleep, only to be woken up AGAIN by my phone ringing! This time it was Cassie's orthodontist asking to reschedule her appointment for Tuesday. They weren't taking any chances and were closing the offices for today and tomorrow. At that point, I figured I was going to have to be up. Jon was already out of bed and said I should "really get up and see this". He opened the curtains to our bedroom windows and like out of some movie, the scene before me was breath taking! Snow falling in huge flakes. The ground completely covered in a few inches of snow and every where I looked was white! Absolutely beautiful!
It bothered me a little how many “Twilight-isms” were found in this book. It has a love triangle between Laurel, the beautiful faerie girl, David, her friend from school, and Tam the mysterious faerie sentry. (Though I have to say that I find Laurel to be a much more agreeable main character than Bella.) I also found the love of the two boys a lot less creepy then in Twilight. They weren’t creepily following her around and insisting that she could only be happy with them. They both just want her to be happy. (Cliché I know)
I had been told that in most cases, it took only a day to get results online, but that it could take up to two weeks. And remember, as I have said before, I am NOT a waiter. Unfortunately I took the exam on a friday. But I was also told that the results could post by as early as 4:30 that day. I left excited and hopeful.
The media, politicians and large institutions both academic and political have been lying to us, and we must demand the truth be told.
Honestly, I can't really think of much that I see as negatives!
The United States is a private corporation owned by the British Crown (Rothchilds), the Bank of England (Rothchilds) and the Vatican (Rothchilds again). It was previously called the Virginia Company until 3/9/33 when it was dissolved by Roosevelt under the Emergency Banking Act. On 5/5/33 Congress elected to dissolve the Gold Standard and Sovereign Authority of the U.S. and all of its official capacities including government offices, departments and officers. The U.S. is a corporation, not a nation. The Federal Reserve is neither Federal, nor a Reserve. It is a private counterfeiting organization run by Jewish bankers who lend the money they print out of thin air at interest while we keep on paying these criminals to fleece the People.

When the works on this recording were made, the heavy hand of worthy Victorian earnestness still haunted British song. Ralph Vaughan Williams was one of the brilliant exceptions, rather than the norm. Don't listen to Brian and think in terms of RVW, Butterworth or Gurney, but rather to the social context of song in the period, which owes as much to parlour song and hymnal as to ersatz pastoralism. Think Granville Bantock, Peter Warlock or C W Orr, whom Stone Records has honoured in a recent recordng. which Andrew Clements admired I'm less convinced, perhaps from having toiled too long in the lesser recesses of English song. But we need to know those valleys, if only to appreciate the peaks. That's why Stone Records' traverse of English song is so important.

The pain was gone. I was ready to exhale, ready for all of this to be over. That's when my doctor said, "Call in any available docs immediately. I need help." There was one of those code things called, I remember that. People were running into the room, running out, getting carts and talking in very hushed tones.

I didn't use any priming sugar as there'll be a couple of gravity points worth left to ferment over time. The only problem is I don't have a very good track record of giving my beers time to mature.

You could see them if you craned your neck in one of the bedrooms, but you got the best view if you stood on the toilet in the little bathroom at the end of the hallway. From this vantage point you could see every nervous dart of the head, every self-consciously indifferent adjustment of the testicles, every letter of the word they were trying so hard to spell – bless them.
N- continues in this vein, accusing the philosophers of falsely elevating themselves with an egotistical ‘highbrow’ taste for remove from society, from the lowly company of the rabble ‘where he may forget “men who are the rule”, being their exception.’ N- thinks that philosophers think of themselves as the exception, but that this is not the path to knowledge, if they were wise, says N-, ‘he would one day have to say to himself, “The devil take my good taste!”…and he would go down…’ Back into the messy everyday social world. Perhaps this comes from another of N-’s opinions as to the human nature, as a social mammal?

I feel like I have come a long way from where I started as a wife, but I know that I still have a long way to go. What happens, doesn't just happen. It's what we make of it. I have gained something from each of the books that I have read and I try to continue to gain more knowledge of being a great wife. The book that I have gotten the most help from though is the Bible. There are countless verses on how to be the wife that God created me to be.

Speaking of seizing opportunities, teenage Brooklyn rapper Astro, whom you might recognize from this season’s The X Factor, has parlayed his success into a nice featured role as a young man bent on revenge. And he’s just in time for a good transitional episode this week, as Reese continues to dig up info on Finch, and Finch has to deal with the fallout from last week’s encounter with the mysterious Root and STILL manage to throw his nephew Will Ingram off the scent of The Machine.
I imagined a more complicated story, as I recall, most college stories tend to be. Would this young woman break into tears after hanging up the phone because she is, she thinks, in love with the male friend on the phone? Although she is trying to be a good friend, deep down, she hopes the talked about love interest turns him down? Either that, or the male friend cheated on the love interest, and this friend of the love interest is coaching him on winning her back? There was certainly drama, something you learn to avoid as you grow older. Drama is bad. Then why do we look back fondly on the most drama-filled period of our lives?!

Then there's the whole nobility versus skaa aspect. At first, I thought maybe these were two different types of people, perhaps different species, or maybe different races, with some identifying traits to keep them separate and easily recognizable. However, with the introduction of half-breeds and skaa infiltrating nobility without being noticed, I have to assume it's solely a class difference between them.
Shifting your focus from love to your purpose will eventually lead you the love your life. Because all the while your praying for God to reveal what your purpose is in life, that path and journey you will take, will open up the things you were meant to acquire in this life time. Purpose is taking me in a new direction, one that I had never imagined but did dream of.

Of the 845 million member base that FB enjoys, over 80% is international with India attributing to 46%. The US membership base has trimmed by about 15% over the past year. Now, those are serious things to consider. International growth is good but domestic membership has to be healthy too to attract and sustain national advertisers. Loss in membership has to be researched to determine causes and to act on them. One thing to remember, in the internet world, if membership numbers can grow overnight, they can drop overnight too. Hence, it becomes all the more important that product innovation and customer service (whether direct or indirect) are prime considerations in the future FB growth strategy.

Incidentally, from his workshop in Cremona, Italy, Antonio Stradivarius (1644-1737) created the most exquisite violins, violas, cellos, and guitars made from the dense, slow-grown wood during the coldest period from 1645-1715 – including his most famous violin “Messiah” of 1716, all producing unparallel acoustics.

Her travels are also interestingly informative about cultures and customs I have never, and will never encounter. Nepal and the customs of death was really interesting to me. Her description of her outsider status and the confusion that engenders is familiar. I spent some time in China in 2000 and I felt like I was a ghost watching a world that I didn’t really exist in. India isn’t a place that’s interested me, but it was interesting to learn about it from Carroll, even if she reconfirmed all the reasons I’ve never wanted to go there. Her Asian travels continue from from Singapore to various parts of Malaysia and Bangkok then into Cambodia. She continues to provide unique insights into that world.

Like everyone else on the course I suspect, I have some minor edits to make to this chapter in light of the tutor’s comments, but this is all part of the process.

T: I think there is so much possibility of perfecting each little detail in the studio, that the soul of the music can die if everything is over analyzed and microcosm’d. When music is recorded, live or in the studio, its kind of hard to explain but I feel that the soul of the music is being recorded and captured, and that hopefully it can be relayed to the listener. When people get goosebumps listening to music maybe that’s a small part of the soul of the recording speaking to them; when there is emotional attachment with the listener with a given recording. What is it about Joplin, or Hendrix, or Billie Holiday, or even further back Robert Johnson, that continues to move people? It is something that transcends time and space and just continues to hit home with the listener. Coming back to the perfection of the recording studio, many inexperienced producers and engineers don’t have the smarts to stop! They keep going for perfection, and there is no soul in perfection. What makes a good record is the ability to capture that elusive feeling that a band can make. The first take, the guide track vocal may not be perfect, but it could be more emotionally moving then the perfect final vocal. Always go back to where you started to make sure you’ve still got that thing that moved you when you first heard the song, the performance.

It’s the hardest elimination she’s had to go through yet, but at least she still has her brother. They are the only pair left in the house. After that we go right into a challenge. They have to climb a cargo net, grab a baseball, run back down and put it in a slingshot to try to get it through a two pane window with their old picture on it. The first one to shoot through both panes wins a one pound advantage. The last one to get done gets a one pound disadvantage!

When I was a little girl we made up little paper “vases” and filled them with spring flowers early in the morning on the first of May. Then I went around the neighborhood and hung them on all the doorknobs. I loved this annual event, but had no idea what May Day was supposed to be about beyond surreptitious flower deliveries. Since writing about a hedge witch – or green witch – I’ve learned a lot more about this holiday.

Therefore, it is usually structured document parsing is not useful. Generally, web scraping that binary data ought to be overlooked — results in that the multimedia information or pictures — and then format the text data pieces which will mistake the specified goal.

Within the interview transcripts, Taylor's interjected comments for the reader on the colour of the interviewees' shirts or their glancing out of a cafe window add little to the narrative, distracting the reader rather than enhancing the stories recounted. Whilst some of the interviewees present new views of the capital (like an aboriculturalist for whom London is one giant flower-bed), others tell you more about what it means to be a paramedic or pilot rather than what it means to be a Londoner. For many interviewees, London is the backdrop to their lives in an entirely abstract way; it has no direct influence over who they are, who they become and how they live. They merely exist within this urban space. When I think of my own evolution into a Londoner (and yes, after 4 and a half years of living, studying, working, playing, exploring and story-telling here I do think of myself as a Londoner) I feel an immensely strong tie between myself and this city. London has made me my current self - the person who glowers at people who don't swipe their Oystercards on the bus, who has perfected a tourist-dodging speedwalk, who knows which bars won't be swamped by office-evacuees at 5.30pm on a Friday night, and who loves catching a glimpse of the London Zoo penguins from a footpath in Regents Park. She's tougher than she was when she arrived, more independent, more financially-sensible, more self-aware. And when I move on to my next city, I will take all those qualities that London gave me along for the ride. Is that not what being a part of a city is all about?

Dropping the Chinese soldier roughly on the ground, Pitcher reached into the cargo pocket of his pants and pulled out a small metal box the size of an Altoids tin. The box was wrapped in duct tape.

But it’s just little ‘ol me, after the court approving my name change, trying to get my new license- my very first form of ID that says my new name on it. I was excited, but as I got to the teller I learned that I really should have held off on that excitement. The teller seemed to have never handled a name change document license renewal form. She kept insisting that she couldn’t do it w/o another form of ID. She said she couldn’t change my name without my social security card with my new name on it. I showed her the instructions in the name change packet issued by the court. It’s all very clear. I am supposed to get my license first, then my social security card. I even called the social security office and they told me that they can’t give me a new social security card without seeing a license with my new name on it. The banter went on for a bit and finally I was allowed to get my new NJ driver’s license with my new name on it… except for the last letter of my first name.

Celery root could be the poster child for the maxim, “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” It’s hard to find anything new to say about its appearance: it’s hairy, it’s brown, it looks unappetizing, and it’s easy to pass over in the produce aisle. I always have. But at this time of year in Missouri, pickings are slim if you’re trying to eat seasonally. Faced with a choice between a hairy, brown but reasonably priced lump or some jet-set produce worth a considerable chunk of my weekly grocery budget, I decided to be adventurous. I bought a celery root, took it home, let it languish in the crisper drawer for two weeks, and then went looking for a way to cook it.

as distant as two sides of the same coin
You hit a tram right at the airport that goes through a tunnel and over a freeway at 650mph with little kids and baggage glued to the back wall; you end up at a huge traffic complex filled with taxicabs, shuttles and car-rental buses. All the little kids and baggage fall to the floor and you get out. You get onto one of the buses that your car rental agency runs. The bus smells really good, like a delicious tropical fruit drink. The driver puts your bags away and you whip off at 650mph over another freeway to a hugeass complex that kind of looks like that three-dimensional chess game from Star Trek (TOS) only it's not made of Lucite and it's full of cars and rental agencies, and only on the inside because the outside just looks like a big concrete box surrounded by depressed palm trees. You are dropped off at your rental office and a person takes you to your car, you get in and off you go. It's almost as quick as it takes to describe it.

In the US, however, the Zionist false-flag scripts are quite different. The Jews must always be seen to be the victims. As demonstrated during the NY synagogue FBI sting operation in May 2009 [and the killing of a guard at the Jewish museum,] various “terrorist” screenplays normally involve uncovering “plots” that involve Arabs/ Arab sympathizers, and “far-right extremists,” blowing up Jewish targets, or killing Jews.

Rather than step up police protection for the besieged farmers, the South African government has has actually scaled back police protection, leaving the farmers to their own devices to befend themselves. not so coincidentally, there has been attempts by the government to legally expropriate Afrkaner farms and hand them out to Blacks who are chosen as lucky recipients by the government.

I thought that they did a good job, they kept to the story in the book and only took out the extras that would have created a much longer movie.

Finally, the Commission failed to consider the efficiencies that package licensing may produce because of the innovative character of the technology at hand. Given that the technology surrounding the Orange Book standard was still evolving, there were many uncertainties regarding what patents might be needed to produce the compact discs. As noted, package license agreements in which the royalty was based on the number of units produced, not the number of patents used to produce them, can resolve in advance all potential patent disputes between the licensor and the licensee, whereas licensing patent rights on a patent-by-patent basis can result in continuing disputes over whether the licensee’s technology infringes certain ancillary patents owned by the licensor that are not part of the group elected by the licensee.

So there is something zeitgeisty about this show which can only help it be successful.

Now I move on to The Voice. I just turned it on halfway through for the night and caught Javier Colon’s new single, which is blowing me away because that happens to be one of my very favorite songs. I don’t quite know that he did it justice, but I would like to hear the recorded version before I make that evaluation in full. I really have missed television and am glad to have a tiny bit of time to catch up and watch stuff like this.

The word itself means “one sent as a messenger.” When applied to the twelve apostles, it means that they were chosen by Jesus and sent into the world in his name and bearing his message. When applied to Jesus, it means that he was sent from the Father to be the Savior of the world. We can see this clearly in John 3:17, “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”

Apparently someone has said that this collection of stories would be a good introduction to Solzhenitsyn—no doubt some publicist—and I can’t disagree, the first few stories anyway, but much better to dive straight into One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and then find a copy of the new translation of In the First Circle which I hear is good. For those familiar with his work and still interested—perhaps that’s the key here—there is more here, though, than just wallowing in the past.

This story was reported on NPR last Sunday but I forgot to bring it up. Now that Instapundit has linked to it, though, here it is: we are about to lose our ability to send out deep space probes due to a lack of specialized plutonium fuel. If I have the NPR story right (and the link is to Popular Science which will have it right), we haven’t made any of this stuff since the 19080s and we have enough of it left for one, maybe two more flights. After that, nothing, and it will take at least eight years to make more.
I mentioned in an article over Christmas that book retailers in Ireland had performed marginally better in 2008 than on previous profits for 2007. However, early figures suggest that the UK book retail trade recorded profits that were marginally down on last year. There is much discussion amongst UK retailers about the strategy of committing themselves to larger discounts for the buying public. The figures for 2008 seem to suggest that without these extenuated discounts, profits would have been significantly up. What this does tell us about the UK market, which has been mirrored in Ireland, is the buying public are actually spending more on books year by year.

Now a first crescent is exciting, with its promise of things to come. But best for me is a moon at first or third quarter. With the sun's light sweeping across the face, the craters and mountains shed long shadows and the edges are accentuated. That's the time to grab your bins and point them skywards. It's a time of dark rumours and fuzzy borders, not just the happy, smiling man in the moon - and yet a time of definition and clarity. That's what the moon is for. To remind us that life is mysterious, and some truth can only be found in shadows.

An afternoon showcase at a non-descript bar on New York’s lower east side provided a surprisingly fantastic showcase. Paste Magazine and rdio.com hosted the showcase of old school country-infused music. Each act was a wonderful example of musicianship and country/folk appeal. The only artist I knew before was Nikki Lane. She opened the showcase and demonstrated an amazing voice overlaying some folky country rhythms. Buxton continued the show with a rousing country-infused version of indie rock. It was wonderfully unique with great musicians at every stop on the stage. Robert Ellis was the most quintessential country. Taking his vibe from Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard, he weaved his way through a quick 30 minute journey of the south. Jason Isbell was the biggest surprise of the afternoon. I had very little expectations when he strolled onto the stage with his acoustic guitar, but he blew me away. He blended folk happenstance with a country twinge to make a beautiful string of well-written songs. For me, he was the most adept lyricist at the showcase, and I’m always a sucker for a simple show with just an acoustic guitar. Who would have thought my favorite multi-band showcase at a hipster festival would turn out to be alt country.

Another way to understand fine crystal is to examine the purpose various pieces are designed to serve. Similar to the way a knife is designed to cut, and a spoon to scoop and sip soup, crystal stemware has its own designations.

Jo Anne and I trust one another a lot. I guess we have too in order for our relation to work for so long and with so much distant between us. When either one of us on out with friends, we tell the other who we are going out with and this includes guys and girls. I have told Jo Anne about all the friends I hung out with or do things with. Jo Anne told me about her friends and I have met some of her guy friends. I trust her because I know when it comes down to it I have her heart. Jo Anne know she has my heart and trust me. We share all kinds of things with one another in order to keep and grow that trust.
Crow (actually she’s more of a Mynah bird) dazzles and frankly even freaks me out. In real life she possesses what beatniks used to call “zero cool” — meaning not that she hasn’t got any, but rather that the cool she possesses is below freezing. (If she were on the deck of the Titanic, she might look over at the Captain and say, “Are you gonna get that shit together, man, or what?”) So when she steps into these diverse, nutty characters it’s as though some supernatural force were taking over. And that to me is the essence of the actor’s art. All actors ought to be doing this kind of channeling, every time, no matter what sort of play they’re in. Further, Crow’s ear for music (evident from her various singing projects) proves to extend to the quotidian melodies of human speech and subtleties of dialect. In a bit over an hour, Crow becomes a crazy Spanish guitar player, a working class philosopher, two separate infomercial hostesses (one mid-western, one Brighton beach Russian, both hilarious), a Vietnam vet and coal miner, a British rock star and an elderly Jewish mother (see their pictures here). The bits are joined — very tangentially — by the common theme of death. In between her turns, we get to hear her do some funny songs as she changes costumes (a rap, a blues number, and so forth). Seeing all these characters together really put the others parts I’ve seen her do in perspective, not just her turns in my last two plays, but especially her Chip Fontaine character with the Electric Mess. Her performances are confident, assured, specific, moving and above all, belly-laugh hilarious. Her comedy writing is top notch (though it could use some shaping and editing). I gather it’s a work in progress — the dead space between her monologues needs to be tightened way up. But aside from such nips and tucks I think Esther has a killer act here. She could take this act to college campuses, cabarets, comedy clubs, television — even, dare I say, vaudeville.

And further south still is la Plage de la Cote des Basques. This was the coolest beach as this is where all the surfers were and, in fact, is where they shot the film “The Sun Also Rises.” On Saturday morning, I stopped at the town’s incredible marché—another French orgy of bread, cheese, pastries, fruit, vegetables, wine, meats, you name it—to bring a beautiful hunk of pain aux cereals (fresh, dense multigrain bread), brebis (the region’s specialty, sheep’s milk cheese) and strawberries (so sweet) with me to the beach where I watched—tres jalouse—the surfers.

I love making burgers at home. I rarely ever order one out at a restaurant. For some reason I consider a restaurant burger to be unhealthy- burgers made at home = healthy. I love my math skills. But truly, if I'm making a burger at home, I always use lean ground beef, sometimes grass-fed, and I don't over do it in the seasoning department. I like them simple. I also almost always top it with some kind of veggie, whether it be mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes...and I use a whole wheat bun. Win win's all around.

If you think that's exaggerating things a bit..., ask yourself when was the last time we were better than a seventh place seed under Sather? Now ask yourself when was the first time?

You would think that by 3 weeks in to the trip we would have the set up/pack up routine down pat but alas, it is still completely chaotic. It isn't so much sorting out the caravan, it is more the issue of sorting out the large amount of children Ben and I have. Someone will need a toilet, or food, or a bandaid, or won't be able to find their drink bottle/hat/shoes, or need a breastfeed (only Diddy requires the breastfeeding just for the record). Just getting everyone into the car and buckled up takes a good fifteen minutes. Putting Diddy in and fitting the mask + turning on the machine takes about 10 of those 15 mins. She hates it and has worked out that she can self remove quite easily. So I have to hold her little arms down till she goes to sleep or have whoever is sitting next to her pin her arms down.

Notwithstanding such travails we arrived at the airport safely, checked in and waited, and waited some more. I am not the world’s most patient person. I began to fidget. After some more time I obtained Sarah’s agreement to begin investigating the delay. After a short discussion the managers of Buddha Air appeared. It seemed that we were the only people who had bothered to turn up for the flight, forgetting us, they had promptly cancelled it. Nevermind though said one, grabing our boarding passes as he spoke, they’d put us on another airline’s flight- no need to recheck in, no formalities, here were the boarding passes. Marvelling at this standard of organisation (and a trifle concerned that an undetectable con was taking place) we got ready to go.
What people refer to as heartbroken is actually a word to describe unresolved emotional pain. The solar plexus is the center for emotional pain and trauma and can be mistaken for our heart because it produces strong emotional sensations and is located just below the heart. Some people even refer to it as the ‘emotional heart’.

"we simply will not abide opposition or interference from the non-white hordes or their jew [sic] puppet masters."Turner recently weathered allegations that he was, in fact, an F.B.I. informant. He allegedly took money for turning in the names and addresses of potentially violent individuals. Turner denied these allegation. In a telephone interview, he laughed at the suggestion, and said it was simply a smear campaign directed against him because of his influence. But he acknowledged that the allegations hurt his standing among the suspicious, and often paranoid, community of white supremacists. It left a stain that may never wash off.

The only person who appears to not be ungrateful (or, to state it more positively, the only person who appears to be grateful) is Joseph, and he was on the bottom of the stack. He was neither the king nor the king’s officers (the cupbearer and the baker) nor the jailer, but from the bottom of life, from the role of the imprisoned servant, he served them all. And yet he was grateful, and everyone else (except maybe the jailer, we don’t know anything about him from this reading today) is ungrateful. Just from this observation alone, it would appear that gratitude is associated with imprisonment and poverty and ingratitude is associated with wealth and power.
Those provisions make mismanagement of a company an offence. It is literally impossible to manage or direct the affairs of a multi-billion dollar company in the absence of audited accounts.

Are you old enough to remember 'We'll hang out the washing on the Seigfreid Line'? I am jolly certain that in those days - everyone hung out their washing to dry. My mother lugged a great basket of it down the garden to the lawn (well, the bit of rough grass) and pegged it out, dashing back and forth on damp days to get it in and put it out again. Years later I remember being at my sister's house in Lowestoft on holiday when my brother in law came in and said to my sister," I've just driven down the road in my car and your washing is by far the whitest!" I remember my sister swelling with pride - he couldn't have said anything more flattering, and that includes 'I think you are the most beautiful woman in the world.'

Utopia: While the common usage of “utopia” as a perfect place derives from literary utopias, it is a mistake to think that utopias are always the author’s vision of a perfect world. Some are; many aren’t. The genre begins with Thomas More’s Utopia (1516), and is originally a kind of fictional travel narrative. Utopian fiction is probably best defined as works that present a realistic, alternate, and in many ways better society than our own through an account by an objective observer. This observer describes the society’s political and social structures, usually after returning home from a visit to the utopia. Because of this need for extensive description, utopian fiction is often more concerned with developing setting than with plot, sometimes leading to the characterization of it as boring or bland. Because of the alleviation of some of our own societal ills in utopias, it is useful to think of them is as critiques of our own world’s shortcomings and, at times, even satire.

This delight is using the same DSP, and ribbon (you get two colours in the bundle) but with a FREEbie stamp set "Fresh Vintage". I have threaded the ribbon through the strip of DSP, which gives it a nice lacey effect. I totally love the border stamp from Fresh Vintage (SAB), which I have stamped along the bottom of the card in Pool Party. The flower image is stamped in Calypso Coral and punched using the new Postage Punch - yum!
Two ways to choose and neither way can be chosen apart from Christ Jesus. He makes the one way possible and makes the other way horrifying. For what is life apart from Jesus? Where is there hope apart from Him? Who can stand?

I decided to take him up on the challenge. The first sip was bitter just as Matt said it would be (latter learning that my palette was adjusting to the taste) but the second sip was different. Different not because it lacked milk & sugar but different because I tasted some thing more. It was lighter in feel but not weak, the taste of it evolved in my mouth through out the whole enjoyment of the cup.

The road goes slightly downhill to In de Oude Pruim (the old prune), and appropriately the most exciting beer the deserted café could offer was the most inferior of the Girardin range, the Ulricher Lager Extra. Better luck then at the Café Camping- if only for its atmosphere as a café for the local football team and the adjoining camping ground. Where else is a camping ground served by a café offering the champagne among beers, oude geuze?

I was reminding myself that the discipline of seeking peace was a perpetual challenge when, suddenly, four bouncy and perfectly-glossed teens hopscotched over several adults and took the spots directly beneath the primary icon of Christ ascending. They didn’t look around to see if, perhaps, they were disturbing anyone’s eyeline or personal space. They didn’t say excuse me. I was staring at the backs of their shiny blonde heads and thinking about sin vs. child development theory (Orangina at the Oyak)— wondering if their self-absorption was age or beauty related— when an extremely, tall, broad-shouldered young man, his height and breadth made even more pronounced by his devotion, placed a kneeler directly in front of me and settled in. His upturned size 12 feet were actually laying on my songbook. It was not that I needed to have a perfect view, but I was now 18″— tops— from his back, his blue-striped sweater becoming my own personal icon. There was only one direction in which to scoot over, closer to the source of the B.O. I picked up my things, repositioned myself a foot to the left, and now, daring to look, discovered that the source of the gaminess was none other than Alistair. He didn’t see me, his eyes shut with beatific intensity.
Enter into this sub-subterranean enclave another a cappella act, this one a sextet of collegiate choral kids who go by the collective handle of Sonos. The gimmick herein is all kinds of clever: Marry the vocal charm of Petra Haden with the sonic innovation of the Vitamin String Quartet, then apply it to the current crop of Pitchfork darlings and package it as the middle ground between Starbucks and Amoeba. It is a concept almost too savvy to work, but it succeeds in every way, by virtue of the sheer talent of the assembled singers and the ingenuity of their arrangements. Throughout its relatively brief running time, Sonos's eponymous debut manages the daunting task of transforming already stellar material into something equally great, while remaining altogether original.
There's nothing really special about this set in general. The Tango Eggs cards look like most other sets around this era. The cards remind me of tobacco and confectionery baseball card releases that documented early 20th century baseball. So what's special about this particular set?

In 1930, a $1,000,000 limestone Art Deco/Art Moderne courthouse was constructed between Guadalupe, San Antonio, Tenth, and Eleventh Streets. Precinct offices were assigned to the ground floor, county offices and courts occupied floors two and three, district offices and courts took over floors four and five, while floors six and seven housed the jail. Many additions and extensions have been made to this Courthouse, starting in the 1950s, so that now the 1930 structure is only a part of a large complex of buildings.

Sparkletits bashing aside, I'd probably adapt one of my own terrible scripts (reworked by Tarantino or something), then hire Bruce Campbell, Timothy Olyphant and Juliette Lewis.

I’d say Kurt Vonnegut launched it with science fiction back in the fifties. Samuel R. Delany and Ursula K. Le Guin weren’t far behind him, casting their own literary spells on the realm of swords and sorcery. Margaret Atwood rewrote the future of speculative history with The Handmaid’s Tale. Toni Morrison’s Beloved, one of if not the most esteemed novel of the twentieth century, is about a haunted house.

However, the association with vitamin D level was most apparent in women who had blood collected outside the summer season, in those from areas with less UVB flux, and in light-pigmented women.
When we live by the teaching that God simply wants to make our name great for our own sakes, we are guilty of idolatry, of forming our own personal god whose main purpose is to meet the needs of the individual. So think about what gifts and talents God has blessed you with and how he wants you to use those to be a blessing to others and not just for the fame of your own name. In my next post, we’ll look at a New Testament text that teaches a similar concept.
The problem is this. If the second chamber does exercise its scrutiny role properly (even more if it is motivated by partisan opposition to the government), it will sometimes reject important government bills. What then? If the bill is a matter of confidence (as are all money bills, and possibly some others), its defeat by convention triggers the government’s resignation or dissolution of Parliament, usually the latter. But is it a good idea to hand to a second chamber with a “will of its own” (as Waldron wants it) the power to threaten and eventually to force dissolution at any disagreement? If this power can be exercised for partisan purposes, as it seems bound to be, this is a recipe for disaster, with elections coming as often as the second-chamber majority thinks it can install its allies in power. On the other hand, so long as the government thinks it has more to gain from an election than the second-chamber majority, it will be able to ride roughshod over the second chamber’s scrutiny by making any bill a matter of confidence and thus threatening dissolution if it is rejected.

Laughter is everyone’s favorite part of the season. Jokes, gift-giving, visiting families, and surprises abound in this time of year, like a massive April Fools’ Day, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and Thanksgiving rolled into a span of time of only two months.

The government policy appears to be to delay foreign intervention by telling the UN and Arab League what it wants to hear while trying to arrest or kill as many rebel leaders as possible and using terror (artillery and air bombardment, restricted movement, starvation) against pro-rebel civilians (most of the population). As long as the Assads have Iranian support (cash, security specialists and weapons), they believe they have a chance to bludgeon the population into submission and survive the rebellion. Iran has a lot riding on this, as Syria and Lebanon are the only two Arab countries that Iran controls, and the Syrian uprising could happen in Iran for the same reasons (corrupt rule and growing repression).

If any one Valentino film can be cited as the strongest in his body of work, it would have to be THE EAGLE, directed by Clarence Brown in 1925 for United Artists. A delicious blend of romantic comedy and period adventure, it provided Rudolph Valentino with a strong story and production values, as well as a role tailor-made to his screen image. The moments of comedy allowed Valentino to display the full range of his acting talents, and he delivers one of his most natural, relaxed performances in this film.

After a day off, I only ran a very slow mile on the treadmill to warm up before doing a grand tour of the Nautilus machines. When I first explored the weight room here at Osan, I hadn’t lifted weights in longer than I care to admit so I was really struggling that first day. However, the weights have been my big stress relief. Lifting replaced running as a way to take out anger and frustration. That first day, I wrote down how much I could lift for three sets of 8-10 reps. Today, I brought that list with me to see how far I have come in the last few months. I was amazed to see that I have nearly doubled the weight on almost all of the machines! Granted, there was one that I couldn’t even use at first because my elbow would lock up painfully, but now I can push 40 lbs! I’m not going to win any contests, and the weights I’m lifting are still pretty pathetic, but improvement is improvement!
We need teachers, unions; stakeholders from parents to administrators, the state and federal involvements. We need a new knowledge culture like other leading industrialized nations! We need for America business, technology, science, literacy and social productive-learning innovators to provide purpose-in-education and case study learning. We need to restore for every diverse perspective into our model society an understanding of what a “sound basic education” is for the 21st century on each grade level with deliverables that relate to jobs, civics, renewable energy and civilization as a whole.

As I’ve tried to suggest here more than once, on the other hand, there’s a lot that can be done and indeed has to be done to help individuals, families, and communities deal with the prosaic but potent mix of difficulties our society’s misguided choices have brewed up for us. Sitting on our backsides waiting for the space brothers or the Rapture to solve our problems is no more helpful than sitting our our backsides waiting for progress or the free market or algal biodiesel farms to solve our problems. These two ends of the spectrum are twins—think of them as the Tweedledoom and Tweedledee of the imaginary Wonderland that dominates so much collective thinking these days—and getting past them, it seems to me, is an essential step on the way to less futile responses to a challenging future.

Third, this particular undertaking of the Sutton’s task force is cosmetic and intended for internal consumption. The membership of the ACNA is quite naïve in matters of ecumenical relations. It is meant to appeal to Convergentist sentiments in that body and the Convergentist vision of the ACNA as a church in which not only are disparate theological streams coming together but also is on the forefront of a similar convergence worldwide. It also helps to justify the existence of the task force and its funding.

The film’s rather dark yet playful sense of humor is apparent right from the start as two kids’ late night bull-tipping session in an attempt to impress a couple of girls leads to the first accidental discovery of a species of fluke-like parasites. Dr. Eli Rudkus (Vincent Ventresca) is the new veterinarian in the small town of Host, having replaced the old one who mysteriously retired. His first house call is to the farm of Jacob Young (William Forsythe) who has a sick cow and casually meets Eli at the front door with a loaded shotgun. He soon gets Jacob’s grudging respect after witnessing how the doctor deals with his sick animal. According to the rancher, his cattle eat feed supplied for free by Tender Meats and in turn they supply the corporation with meat from their farms.

They got four fantastic flavors of single slice pizza options: BBQ chicken, vegetable medley, chicken-spinach-mushroom, and the SIX CHEESE MEDLEY!!!! Since I like my chicken deep fried, dipped in butter and my veggies come from the garden, I went for the SIX CHEESE MEDLEY. Cheese is what pizza is all about and this slice-a-pie was tasty. It's a darn good thing there was only one slice in there or this would have contributed to my overwhelming gluttony cause I could have eaten a whole big ol' pizza pie. It was tough to resist the temptation to use the second coupon they sent me so that I could get another slice of this tasty pizza, but that one I am giving away to someone who leaves a comment on this post saying they would like to try the new Freschetta By the Slice.

WOW - I can't believe that we are at week 150; I first joined in WOYWW back in January 2010 when there were just a handful of people. Not even major surgery kept me from posting back then - the very special Anne (A stitch in Time) helped me out back then and gave regular progress dates of my time in hospital (I was having a tumour removed from my chest cavity - next to my lung, so had major open chest surgery - where they cut me open between two of my ribs and clamped me open while they deflated my lung in order to get the tumour out)... Annie was truly a star - she will always have a piece of my heart for the love and support she showed me back then - and we hadn't 'known' each other long... Anyway, last year was a major hiccup for me so I missed quite a few months of joining in, because I found myself only being able to do one task at a time - and that seemed to be one or two things per week.

The world that Rachel Vincent has dreamt up here is fascinating. There’s no specific era or setting (other than it being in the US) but I’m tempted to imagine it being in the near future somewhere near the East Coast. I don’t know why, that’s just where I situated it in my head.

The recent mauling of policemen in east London has brought this issue back into the public eye but it is an everyday issue for some. Earlier this year the Guardian reported that 12 Royal Mail workers a day were attacked by dogs and that A&E admissions in London for young people with bite injuries have increased by 119% over the last 5 years. I can well believe this. As the mayoral election campaign hots up those of us mad enough to be out delivering election leaflets for the various candidates have more than enough experience of weapon dogs. We have had numerous dog bites over recent years. One poor guy had only just been persuaded to start leafletting and was bitten on about his 5th house – next stop hospital and a tetanus jab and, unsurprisingly, we haven’t coaxed him out since. Another fellow campaigner of mine was badly bitten last year by a dog while putting a leaflet through a door but, despite reporting what was clearly a dangerous dog to the police, nothing was done and that is, currently, the law. If you put your hand through someone’s letterbox your hand has entered private property and the law does not apply outside of public places.
Finally, we have 2011 Opening Day. Opening Day, much like UD First Edition, is a lower end set with very little in the way of AU/GU inserts. The cards look like the regular base set but cheaper... almost as if someone scanned the base design and then printed it with a household printer.
Note: Every Monday, I'll be posting some notes about the new fantasy baseball league called No Crying in Baseball that I'm hosting. Feel free to read and comment, but it's mostly for the members of that league. And this goes against the Golden Rule of fantasy sports which states "No One Cares About Your Fantasy Team", but I don't give a crap. So read on, or don't...I'm jake either way.

In the medical profession, as a biology teacher or forensic scientist you get used to skeletons hanging around. So this is today’s hot tip of the day: Probe your own bones – unless you are fat, in which case all you will do is make a pathetic dent which will send you straight to the corner shop to buy a mars bar to cheer you up.
What made Heidfelds fire more concerning was the apparently explosive moment when debris and gasses were blown out from the cars sidepod as the marshals sprayed extinguisher foam over the burning bodywork.

The study results showed that the group with higher amylase activity had lower blood glucose levels identical to those in the low amylase mishmash. The lower blood glucose levels in the high amylase group gives the impression to be a end result of prior to aid of insulin in this combination of participants.
Rats, Cats, Dogs, Lizards etc also responds to ultrasound. Very high intensity sound from ultrasonic pest chasers creates stress on them and they escape from the place. But animals are intelligent than us, and they become immune to ultrasound very fast so the use of such pest repellents is effective only to new populations.

On a remote research facility in the middle of the ocean scientists try to cure Alzheimer’s by experimenting on the brain make up of Mako sharks. Unsurprisingly this ends in tears before bedtime. Under the noble but stupid impression that by increasing the brain capacity of the sharks they can then harvest the tissue as a potential cure for Alzheimer's disease scientists prod about in shark’s heads until all hell breaks loose. It turns out that the increased brain capacity also makes the sharks faster, more dangerous, more intelligent and more angry so naturally they begin to engineer their escape and their bloody revenge on dratted scientists who have imprisoned them.
I'll still be reading too many sewing / homemaking / parenting blogs, but my days as a blogger myself are over, at least for the time being. I've had fun with Mama's Sewing Room, but 8 months in I really have to admit that I just don't have time for blogging at the moment. I've completed my Diploma of Professional Counselling but I'm starting the advanced papers soon, and focussing on networking and looking for more volunteer / work experience opportunities. Whatever "me" time is left, I'd rather spend it all sewing!

Outside of my basement door is a Rose of Sharon shrub. It is full of blooms all summer long and reminds me of my childhood because my neighbor had several of these plants in his yard.

3. Her shoes are fantastic! Platforms and towering heels. I also love the lingering shots of them. (This is sort of a Wishman signature - as I've seen the lingering feet shot in several of her films.)
10:11 PM – Sheamus joins us from SmackDown to take on Mark Henry. Daniel Bryan is then announced as the special guest referee. YES! YES! YES! The match never quite gains any momentum as Bryan screws Sheamus out of the win with a quick count. Bryan then manages to get Sheamus in the YES lock and gain some momentum going into Extreme Rules.
NOT ONLY THAT: Kaitlyn was the smart one of the bunch. She didn’t even appear like she was in class, you saw nothing reflecting on her except when her mouth was open and her teeth were a shinin… whereas Hollie and I had reflective shirts on, and my shoe laces were BLINDING. Jill knew- all she had to do was look at my feet and know how fast I was going. BLOWN. I feel like when Jill would yell faster she was staring at my feet waiting for improvement. SO MUCH SHAME.

One by one we contacted people that we knew were coming only to find out that they couldn't make it. Zee, my beautician had got home late and didn't have time to get to Bristol, K had got as far as Shepton Mallet before being defeated by all the traffic resulting from people leaving Glastonbury and also everyone who was trying to get the Bristol for a Bon Jovi concert. I certainly can pick nights to do things. I think I might just have to do my routine again especially for Lou, Zee and K. More locally this time, I'm sure that I can find a suitable venue.

If you're reading this, you probably know that I love being a father. I knew in my early 20s that I would enjoy being a dad, but I also knew that I needed to settle down a bit first - not only so I would be more patient and present, but so I could really enjoy what I knew would be the most heart-enriching journey of my life.

Bread & Butter has attached the term "gastropub" to Gram & Dun, essentially meaning it's loosely derived on a traditional pub concept (featuring libations) but is consciously dialing up the emphasis on its food (ergo "gastro"). After perusing the menu, I'd say it's a super-gastro gastropub as the food menu was much larger than I expected and the beers and wines, though also numerous, perhaps a hair less impressive in comparison.

From the moment I set foot in Córdoba all I´ve heard about, from both natives and expats alike, is the Month of May. May is the month when Córdoba comes to life with festivals, dance and culture. It is the month where the locals come out of their winter-long hibernation and in their droves take to the streets of Córdoba in celebration. It has to be said that between La Cata (the wine-tasting festival), Las Cruces( the crosses), Los Patios( the courtyards) and La Fería (the fair) Córdoba certainly has something to offer everyone.

Upon returning from the tour, “James” met a Loew’s booker named Mark Leddy who finally started him on his way. The act had evolved into a sort of parody of vaudeville. “James” would mock other acts, by doing bad ventriloquism, a bad song on banjo, and of course, bad juggling . It is readily apparent that such an act was light years ahead of its time. Such “ironic” entertainment doesn’t really become widespread in the U.S. until the late 1950s and even then it is considered subversive (Bob and Ray, Nichols and May, Lenny Bruce, even Mad Magazine). Not unil the 1970s and 1980s would it become mainstream with Saturday Night LIve, SCTV, and David Letterman’s various shows). There can be little doubt that for a long time, folks just didn’t “get” Fred Allen’s sense of humor, which accounts for his ten year crawl to the top.
Close Obama family members would need to be complicit. However, how many of those are there? Both Obama's mother and father died well before he launched his bid for the presidency, so they are out of the picture. Both his grandfathers were also dead, leaving only his two grandmothers and his siblings.

Finally there’s the L pattern. The “L” competition is to show what a drum major is capable of doing “as the leader of a marching band”. The judging is to be as if a band is following the drum major. The “L” pattern consist of the following: Start, Left Turn, Counter March, Right Turn, Salute and Halt. Beating of time is done between each signal. Or at least, that’s what this site told me. haha. yeah. that’s the gist of it.

Juckwoo and Tei, having debuted in 2004, currently hold the shortest careers on the show. Since “I Am a Singer” celebrates veteran performers, we will stick with indie artists who have had careers of at least the same length.

Instead, he escaped. After being rescued by a friendly noble who wanted to save Luther’s life, Luther went to a castle where he said he did the hardest work ever. At his time in the castle, Luther translated the New Testament into German.
Two things wrong with this situation. First, the Federal government is incurring over a TRILLION dollars in debt every year. And our politicians are now concerned about saving $5.6 billion over 30 thirty years relative to paper dollar bills? This is only.02% of a TRILLION dollars. Sounds like more bad priorities.

I remained silent and waited. Nothing. It would appear to be an entirely altruistic gesture. We’ll see I guess when I neck one. A day later the lout had been in the fridge and I settled down to one. The bottle informs me it is a 4.8% chill filtered lager. “Premium” 5% brands have arguably had some success with lower alcohol 4% spin offs. The stronger spin offs from the standard 4% brands seem to die a death pretty quickly. There is a logic to this, the 5% brands have a bit of authenticity to them but if you don’t want to get too pissed up you can manage it on 4%. When standard brands go up market they appear to be standard with more alcohol rather than actual premium products. How will this fair? Anyone’s guess. Carling has a new brand out called “chrome” in this category so I guess it’s time for brand extensions all over again.
Gosh, how i really need one..
Mary was ‘just seventeen’ when she suddenly died in her in-laws’ house, collapsing on the stairs and expiring while held in Dickens’ arms. Of course, anyone would have been upset, but his subsequent reaction to grief was very far from normal, and how on earth must his wife have felt when, for years afterwards, he continued to keep all of Mary’s clothes, even bringing them out to stroke, and often professing an earnest desire to be buried in the dead girl’s grave.

Being quite a student of leadership I have read quite widely on the subject. This title is one that has taken a place pretty near the top of my favorites. It hardly matters the leadership role you find yourself in this is a book that will be very relevant. So for the teacher, coach, parent, business leader, etc. there will be much to motivate, encourage, and correct you.

Dick Cheney must be unbelievably arrogant. When asked a question by a reporter several years ago concerning polling information that indicated the majority of Americans were against the war in Iraq he responded, "So what?" I guess his point was that American national interests outweighed the will of the American people. That sounds like a contradiction.
I never thought the Goddess can be killed, I always thought she is invincible, immortal as this is how love should be in order to last a life time. But she insulted me for not answering to her phone calls on New Eve’s night, for not being by her side. Although I was always the one trying to be with her and I was always pushed backed, ignored, my phone calls never returned, my mails never answered, my phone messages never replied. All of those didn’t matter for me as I was in love and love was strong and pure in my heart. The fact that I was ignored didn’t upset me.
The contradictions the darker elements of Shock Corridor aim to reconcile appear to share common ground with that of the traditional Hollywood musical, despite the treatment of these paradoxes being glaringly different in tone and style.

The phrase Freedom of Religion is indeed “historically grounded” and has come to have a very definite meaning in practice — and practice is the key here. If I have Freedom of Religion it means I not only have the right to choose my religion and practice that religion within the confines of my home and/or my place of worship — it also means I have the right to practice my religion outside of those places, what we speak of as the Public Square.
The change of moving our life to Bedford has been one of challenge and breakthrough. There is evidence of both in my life! The challenges for us are obvious – kids finding school very tough, making new friends, the cost of leaving people and a place we loved, many tears and insecurities. It is honestly painful.

In 1993 Carter made a trip to Sudan. The sound of whimpering near the village of Ayod attracted Carter to an emaciated Sudanese toddler. The girl had stopped to rest while struggling to a feeding center, whereupon a vulture had landed nearby. He said that he waited about 20 minutes, hoping that the vulture would spread its wings. It didn’t. Carter snapped the haunting photograph and chased the vulture away. However, he came under criticism for just photographing — and not helping — the little girl.

requireshate: Here’s something knee-jerky (but, I think, not unjustified): I don’t think it’s possible for white westerners to write about any non-dominant cultures–and this includes, for example, Eastern Europe–without being exotifying, appropriative, and perpetuating western/first-world supremacy. Ekaterina Sedia articulated it fantastically here: http://worldsf.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/guest-post-seeing-through-foreign-eyes-by-ekaterina-sedia-author-week-1/ Specifically that an outsider looking in will seize on elements an insider takes for granted. Something that’s everyday to me will be shiny, exotic, and unusual to a westerner: and it is this thing that they will grab and run away with, hooting that it’s beautiful and awesome and so weird, as one might do over an alien artifact. And that’s what it will be to such a person–alien. I’ve seen this over and over even from writers who mean well, who have lived in Thailand, but who nevertheless continue to write and think in the western outsider mode, in short owing their allegiance to their culture, readers who think and consume and behave as they do.

But I even think that’s funny. I thought I was oh so high and mighty, and I really wasn’t. I like to tell the stories of when I was a real asshole because they’re hilarious. I mean, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve found that the best way to get over it is to just have it right out in the open.
Additional protection to the castle was provided late in the 13th century when stone walls were constructed, with towers, to enclose the town. Ironically, the safety provided by the town walls led to the neglect of the fabric of the castle. In 1589, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth the castle was described as being ruinous. From the early 17th century onward this situation was made worse by the construction of shops and houses on much of the site, often using the fabric of the castle for building materials.
In the process of reviewing each negative, assessing physical condition and date, I’ve seen (and indexed) a great many unusual images. When newspapers were more local in their production and coverage, there was a strikingly personal touch to the content. Between the 1930s and early-1950s, I started to take note of a few sensitively composed images of people writing, even indicating the pencil-writers in my spreadsheet index. This cast of characters is at school, at work, at home, and outside. Here are a few of the gems (from the '30s - '80s, so far) with hopes that you’ll find some encouragement to write your days and journeys. Enjoy the photographs which are little worlds that now visit ours, and enjoy the continuum in which each of us participate.

It’s a central tenet of Christianity (though certainly not one held by every Christian I know) that only through accepting and praising Jesus Christ as the son of God can any of us be “saved” – that is, reaching a state of being worthy to enter Heaven. Clearly I have some problems with the whole God thing in the first place, but let’s try not to get bogged down in petty details like whether or not he actually exists.
My husband was astonished to discover the other night that I considered him a Mr. Rochester. He had read Jane Eyre and had never been able to understand what Jane, or the girls in his high school English class, saw in such a horrible man. Then I read this quote to him, where Jane describes Rochester’s character:
I'd tried to convince myself that since I'd finished the first draft that hey, I could probably give it a go. I read the instructions. I should have known better. But then reality hit.

I just listed these lovely earrings in my shop. I titled them, "Black Bead and Flower Dangle Earrings." Not the most creative of names, but as I understand it, it's better to give them a name that's easily searchable, and this is the best thing I could come up with to describe them!

He paid me double the meter, something I appreciated more for its acknowledgement implication than its monetary value. And I noticed that he had not fastened his seat belt even though he was sitting up front seat with me. A sign of trust, I thought, that I also appreciated.
Now imagine a white policeman did something like that during the Apartheid years…There would be an outcry all over the world.

There is a remote side to your 3 Life Path, as well. This comes as a surprise to the native and to those who think they’re well acquainted. The 3 is actually a very sensitive soul. When hurt, you can easily retreat into a shell of morose silence for extended periods. Nonetheless, the 3 eventually copes with all of the many setbacks that occur in life and bounces back for more. It’s usually easy for you to deal with problems because you freely admit their existence without letting them get you down for too long. Because of your own sensitivity to hurt, you have a caring disposition and are usually conscious of other people’s feelings and emotions.
Hello Creative Scrappers!
I was beyond devastated when it was announced that “Hair” had been cancelled….Gareth was due to play the lead role of Claude at over 10 venues in the UK- I should have been seeing him on the 28th of April in Manchester, but on Gareth’s official website (www.garethgates.com) this disappointing message was posted :
The members then were living their previous normal life again. Eugene works at the cafe/restaurant his dad owns.One night he wanted to play a CD in the cafe, but accidentally it was a CD from Oh Gu Ju for him. He was hesitant at first but then he search Oh Gu Ju. He went to their base but Oh Gu Ju had already gone to the airport. At the base the other manager got a letter which proves that Eugene was innocent, so he went to the broadcasting station, persuade the program producer and called Eugene to get Oh Gu Ju and the members ready for the broadcast later that night.

Though he doesn’t have an exact room number to give Crow for Shannon’s location, the driver does give a number for a nearby room so that Crow can gain his bearings. With the information in hand, Crow makes his way to that location. But as he makes his way to that location, one of the other people in the hospital notices him. She doesn’t recognize Crow at first, but when she does, it will cause problems for Crow and the other two. After calling Crow, the driver begins to call the third member of their little band of misfits to let him know where to go. But before he is able to make his call, the third member of the group shows up.

If you have watched the news, logged on to facebook, twitter or payed attention to any other media outlet lately then you have probably heard about the Trayvon Martin murder. To give a bit of backstory for those who do not know, Trayvon Martin was a 17-year-old Florida teen who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. The boy was coming out of a liquor store after buying snacks; Trayvon was unarmed and wearing a black hoodie. Mr. Zimmerman was on neighborhood watch duty and claimed that he called into the police about a suspicious prowler in the vicinity and Trayvon fit the description. After not getting much of a response from the police Zimmerman took matters into his own hands and followed Trayvon and shot him in a struggle that he claimed was in “self-defense” even though Trayvon was guilty of no crime. Zimmerman was not arrested after the shooting.
Tiger normally answers media questions before each tournament, but this week at the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow, he answered questions for the fans instead, posting a video answering questions from Facebook and Twitter. Woods’s agent Mark Steinberg told ESPN.com that they were behind on social media and this was an attempt to make up for that and connect with the fans who have been so good to him over the years. See the full video here.

Young families find the shade of the jetty a cool and pleasant place to build sandcastles, stretch out on towels or frolic in the shady shallows, away from the heat of the early afternoon..... An Indian woman, dressed in colourful regalia, watches her husband and children splashing and playing nearby.... a talented young boy rides his skim board back and forth as the incoming tide sends blankets of shallow water onto the shore.... a little girl in pink, frilly bathers, splashes her dad in fits of giggles ...... a group of teenagers throw a variety of balls amongst each other, standing up to their waists in the sea, their voices happy and playful. An elderly woman in a smart pair of bathers wades out through the small waves, a delightful look of pleasure on her face.

This is not an abstract philosophical question but a profound spiritual contem plation that can take you to the essence of what it means to be alive. Why did some thing come from nothing … and become light, energy, matter, life, consciousness and you — 14 billion years later reading these words?
A family in my hamlet, whom Matt has known since birth, I have known for 20 plus years and our children are friends, found out that their 12 year old son had brain cancer. This happened days before Thanksgiving and he was operated on days after. The entire family has been nothing but positive. The boy has been fighting a courageous battle and continues to today. He has had 2 surgeries, radiation, chemo all the while continuing his school work and learning everything there is to know about ipads and iphones.

One of the Kardashian’s is taking a break from the cameras. Khloe Kardashian Odom and hubby Lamar have put their show (cleverly called Khloe and Lamar) on indefinite hiatus for Lamar to focus on his basketball career, as well as his kids (from a previous relationship). Lamar has had a pretty tough year being traded by the Lakers to the Dallas Mavericks and he is now sitting out the rest of the NBA season. In the announcement there was a “you never know”, so maybe there is some baby news (I really hope there is)! Before you get too upset, the two will still be making appearances on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Bristol, 17/2/2012 13:47 ####…and you, as an ‘insider’ totally miss the point, or are being deliberately obtuse. The results, or final pay out if you will, were totally in the hands of those offering the product, not market forces. They are in the position of being able to influence things, by moving money around and paying themselves huge dividends to the extent that the funds in question generate little if any interest, just sufficient to keep on going, then blaming poor market performance for the poor results. Lawyers and bankers are of the same mould – parasites.

So I went to the vet to spend some time with her before she died and I am so happy I did. I had gone the night before and I am extremely grateful that I did that as well. When I got there, I held her and cried and cried and cried. I told her I was sorry I couldn't make her better. I can't even tell you how many times I apologized to her. I felt horrible. She looked at me with the saddest eyes and I knew I was doing the right thing. She tried to purr and she wagged her tail a little bit. But then she started getting worse. Right there in my arms she started getting worse. Thankfully a friend of mine told me she would be there with me and I'm so happy she was. It was hard enough having to put my kitty to sleep, but to do it without your daddy there was worse.
I love the idea that the surface of a parking lot could become something like a new screen technology—a depth-cinema of lost evidence from earlier phases of human history, shining from within with archaeological remains as researchers walk back and forth above.

Florida’s spending on substance abuse programs has dwindled, even as the inmate population has remained constant and the “pill mill” epidemic of prescription drug abuse has swollen. “In the last few years, we’ve gone backward,” says Lori Brown of Bridges of America, an Orlando-based treatment program that has partnered with the prison system. The emerging debate echoes a growing conservative movement known as Right on Crime, which calls for a re-examination of laws that lock up non-violent offenders, wasting lives and costing billions in the process. The movement’s latest supporter is former Gov. Jeb Bush.
Just from looking at the cover of The Replacement you can tell that this book will send chills down your spine. The juxtapostion of the knives over the pram is enough to scare me, not only that but the story is pretty scary too! A perfect read for a Halloween night.

The Court reasoned that Article 3 requires States to provide persons deprived of liberty with appropriate medical treatment. The Chamber noted that the applicant’s condition required medical treatment and that the prison could not provide the needed assistance. The Court then held that the long term detention of a prisoner in a condition where they cannot move about independently. The national court overseeing the movement of the applicant from the prison to the hospital even noted that moving the applicant back to the prison opened Italy up to a finding of a violation of Article 3.

A few weeks ago, I began getting questions about the Franklin-Madison Literary Agency. Never having heard the name before, I did some research. What I found rang warning bells. From the creepy image of what look like conjoined twins on the opening page, to the badly-written text, to the absence of any substantive information on the agency and its staff, Franklin-Madison offers an impressive collection of red flags.

From my perspective, it’s pretty easy to see how much the rest of the world has imitated US obstetrics, apparently unaware of the ignorance of women’s bodies upon which this model of obstetric care was constructed. Australia, for instance, imitated the UK during the early 20th century, by keeping midwifery (but a midwifery that accepted the dominance of medicine). Midwives had a certain amount of autonomy until the move came to make every birth take place in hospital. When a few women rebelled during the 1970s against the lack of choice this meant for them and started Australia’s home birth movement, organized medicine’s attack on home birth practitioners was swift and savage, with the de-registration of Dr. John Stevenson, the family physician who stood behind some of those first home birth midwives. According to what I’ve been told by countless Australian moms and midwives is that it has gone pretty much downhill since then.

We all know that water is essential to survive but did you know that it can help you lose weight? Here is the deal, for metabolism to take place, water is required. When you have a high metabolism you burn fat and lose weight. For most of us, drinking water is just not “natural” anymore because we’ve trained ourselves to drink soda and other mixed drinks to quench our thirst. So it can be challenging to remember to drink at least 2l of water daily. A great trick I use and that works great for me is to use the “out of sight out of mind” theory in reverse here. So basically, I make sure to have a bottle of water in plain sight at work or wherever I am like the living room, in my room etc because when I see it and it’s in my face, I tend to reach more for it. So drinking at least 2l of water a day becomes a piece of cake cause I don’t even have to think about it. The benefits of water go beyond simply helping you lose weight, you will feel good, look good and actually have energy, so try it out and tell me if it works for you!
Me: Wrong answer, bucko.
Dash Shaw is an utterly brilliant young cartoonist who has, in a few short years, advanced from the academic experiments of his earlier work (like the promising Goddess Head) into a formalist genius whose skills encompass both a natural gift for color and a feel for subtle, indirect characterization. Bottomless Belly Button is a daring, daunting work, a 700+ page tome about a mildly dysfunctional family; the book captures the particular moment when the family's parents call together their three grown-up children to announce their divorce. Shaw applies a barrage of formal techniques and styles to documenting the disparate reactions of these characters to the situation, evoking emotions through the sheer force of his drawing rather than stating them outright. His effects are both nakedly symbolic and yet somehow supple, like the way he draws the family's youngest son with the head of a frog, only revealing the meaning of this otherwise unexplained device in a brief, elegant sequence and then continuing to use it to reveal the character's essence throughout the rest of the book.

The next thing is to discover why we get fog so I can set the month. I’m building a tower, designing a room, a man and his mother. The skeleton was created about five or six years ago so it’s very exciting to finally see how tall he stands and how thick the muscle grows, bulking out this hulk. I’m also very interested to see how this theme works in the three very different sections of the novel. At the minute my head is planning to write each section as a kind of stand-alone story between 20-30k, and I’m diving back into this character first, hooking up the electricity to charge the story. Even though he is not the main character, he has to grab the reader and imprison them.

But now…the more think about it, what my son is on paper is not what he always is in the classroom and out in real life. And what triggers his autistic traits to come out are generally what are found in the mainstream school setting; the hum of voices in a confined area, many things going on at one time in this setting, many people/classmates moving around him…that buzz or hum causes him to shut down, act out, become noncompliant, meltdown. We have yet to see any real success in this area without one-on-one help. Now I am wondering if I stressed this very real trigger enough to our new team. There was no talk of a para for him. I do remember questioning this at one point where I was “assured” that they would have resources to pull in someone for him if needed.
I always try to learn something from every book I read. No matter, whether it is interesting or boring. The lesson learnt from this book is never lose your hopes, how rough time you are going through. You never know what destiny has in store for you. A miracle may happen which is only capable of changing your destiny. For that, you must have the faith in time and in your own efforts. So, I believe in miracles. Do you??

This made me wonder about those of us who emigrate on our own. Is such an emotional anchor harder to come by? Or do we simply seek it out in other relationships, in the new friends we meet abroad, or in the ex-pat community we find ourselves in? And would emigrating with a partner facilitate or disrupt one’s integration in the new country? Would this relationship be something that would give us the strength and the support we need to make our way in the new world—or would it create for us a cultural safe haven at home, a place we can retreat to when living in foreign place gets to be too much? Or a little bit of both?

But usually, they’re easier.

I also disagree that there are certain "core subjects" that must be learned. As far as I'm concerned, a healthy community is made up of many people with many different skills, experiences, and knowledge bases. The things that are important for each individual to learn are those important to that individual. The idea of "gaps in knowledge" at all is pretty ridiculous, actually, when everyone can agree that there is a colossal amount of information out there. No one can hope to absorb any more than a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge available to them, so everyone no matter what their education will have "gaps"! It's just a matter of whether the knowledge you do have is of your own choosing, knowledge that is meaningful and worthwhile to you, or whether it's chosen by someone else, and forced down your throat "for your own good".

Don't get me wrong... I've always loved Christmas. It really is my favorite time of the year. But, I've been increasingly convicted over the last few years that our Christmas needs to be more about the baby in the manger and less about the baubles that our North American Christmas has become. We've made a few changes-some additions and subtractions over the last few years, but there are so many traditions related to our location and our relationships that I haven't really thought about, I've simply done them. I'm planning to put some real energy into re-thinking our "normal" before next year. I'm sure lots of the old favorites will stick, but there is definitely some revision to be made.

In life, we come across mountains. They are challenges that face us. Often we want to go the easy way, but eventually, we will find ourselves stuck. We have to climb if we want to move on. We are living in a world that is marred, and deep inside, we long for something perfect, something glorious, something beyond words. If we stay in the valley, we will die, because that’s not where we belong. We have to keep pushing on, and at each mountaintop, we sometimes catch a glimpse of the the paradise that we are searching for. If we follow the right road, somewhere, beyond the mountains, we will find our home.

For really the first time ever in my life I feel like a big PAUSE button has been pressed. My life sits there frozen on the screen, most likely with a dumbfounded expression on my face. I’m scared to have the PLAY button pressed again because I’ve become used to this state of motionless uncertainty. Strangely, I’ve become comfortable in what once seemed like the endlessness of it all. Suddenly the light at the end of the tunnel has become very visible and it just keeps getting brighter and brighter.

I always knew this day would come. As a kid one of my favorite movies was Home Alone. It’s still in my top 20 (okay, top 10). I loved the silliness of it for sure, especially when Harry (Joe Pesci) gets blow-torched (that sounds MUCH more morbid when you can’t see it). But I always loved the scenery of the movie, particularly the snow. I thought it would be cool to live up north (something I didn’t say out loud in the South) and actually have a white Christmas. Now I will.

I suppose to a certain extent I can’t help thinking Kelsier is not in a strong enough position to dismiss any potential allies, but, saying that is easier said than done. It would be incredibly difficult to relay your plans about overthrowing the Lord Ruler to a bunch of the nobility – they’re his little favourites after all and even though they might have squabbling between themselves they have very easy and indulgent lives (at the Lord Ruler’s whim) and they have a lot to lose. Plus the skaa are nothing to them. There are a few with consciences (or so it appears) but are they going to get on board with a situation which potentially loses them their workforce or their lives? Despite that, I do like Elend, I’m not totally sure he’s going to be a man of action – maybe he’s going to uncover something important with all his reading. I can’t help thinking that reading is going to play a part her somewhere – we keep being told about all Elend’s reading and now Sazed with his translation of this all mysterious book!
Life is short, and we don't own the next second of breath. All we really have is those moments that have passed. Humanity is fallibility. So taking a moment to reflect on the past, on the future, on our relationships, on those around us and on our status with them and with God, is important.

I think the doctors have figured out it’s okay to hold middle-aged women and men hostage.
OH my! Target has a line of kitchen goodies for Hello Kitty! It's really quite amazing to realize that someone out there right NOW probably has Hello Kitty everything in their home. Literally, EVERYTHING. Oh yes, it is possible. Take a look at all this!

He grabs a papery substance and picks up the feces with it. He goes into that little room they showed me yesterday, the one that had a really cold hard floor and big, cold-looking white things in there. I hear a whooshing watery sound. He comes out of the little room and pours some liquid on the floor where my feces had been.
Now they’re marching for choice and publicly supporting the ‘right’ to an abortion
The surface of the liquid crystal matrix before him shimmered with his every breath, sensitive to the slightest vibration in the air.

The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games are expected to draw 11m visitors from around the world to the UK’s capital for seven weeks, and 3m extra car journeys are anticipated on the busiest day.
On the other hand, we have a random outburst by some guy named Clement – who, I’m guessing, was too cheap to hire an American housekeeper.
After talking about how the movie compared to the book... what we liked, what we didn't, after consuming our night's dessert on the beds in our hotel room (a family tradition I am happily continuing), we cuddled into our beds and talked writing. She told me all about the story she's working on right now, and I read her the first six chapters of the Storm narrative I've been writing (with a synopsis of the racier Chapter 7). She gave critiques, and I talked to her about what I was envisioning for the next chapter. It was just tremendously cool to talk to each other as both growing writers.
I haven’t had a chance to finish my March to Your Own Beat blog posts, but I’m getting there very slowly! If you’re interested, you can skip over to Laney’s blog Crash Test Mummy and check out the challenge.

Renault meanwhile turned the problem on its head. As the aim of the EBD is to increase flow under the car, they pointed their exhaust at the front of the floor. I’ve had it confirmed to me by two ex-Renault sources that the exhaust does indeed mainly flow under the floor.
I’m nearing the end of my second week here. I’ve finished my first round of interviews and I’m quite happy with the results so far. The respondents were knowledgeable on the subject, and confirmed each others answers. I’m now on my way to Hang Yen province to talk with some local government officials and potato farmers and traders.

Question 1: If you knew a woman who was pregnant, who had eight children already, three who were deaf, two who were blind, one mentally retarded, and she had syphilis, would you recommend that she have an abortion?
I think to follow them dog hound style.
I’ve often felt guilty over the lack of a stronger attachment to my father; so in a way, the fact that I’ve been a bit weepy for the last 30 hours is a relief. Perhaps I’m not a completely cold fish and unnatural daughter after all. Maybe there’s hope for us.

I find that I am tired and more grumpy than I've any real right to be. My doctors have been great with listening to me and really hearing what I am saying about my anxiety and working with me to put me at ease. I have a lot of testing and monitoring (probably made easier by the fact that my blood pressure has given high/wonky readings so they can categorize it under PIH/Pre-E observation and testing, though it continues to come back clear time and again. . .). I have a few contractions - mostly BH, I think. Random, mildly annoying. The baby is big and stretching makes me cringe because various sharp body parts are poked into painful places and there really isn't much room in there any longer.

The tally was down from 2008, which found 1,352 incidents — in part because of the new approach to swastikas. (The group is considering whether to issue a separate report on swastika incidents that were excluded from its audit).
UPDATE: 25th February, 2011. Although the mainstream media is not yet reporting on outcome of the hearing today it seems that there is a motions hearing scheduled for next Friday 4th March 2011 at the Supreme Court before Mr. Justice Hardiman, Mr. Justice Finnegan and Mr. Justice O’Donnell at 11am which suggests that McInerney is appealing and is probably seeking a motions hearing to continue its examinership protection pending the appeal. More later…

Immediately after I took this picture, she took off one of the frog's eyes, and proclaimed him the Pirate Frog King. He keeps his eye in the pocket on his stomach for safe keeping. Kids are weird, man.
Note: When I say this it means I really need the HUG more than any words can say and that I need you-not the person standing next to you or for that matter anyone else-it means I need you! And since I do not ask often (I would rather not ask for help or even a hug-geez I never realized how stubborn and frustrating that I could be. lol) So be an awesome person and show your HUMAN SIDE…HUG ME FAST!!! You can make a hug difference in someone’s life! It does not get much simplier than this!
It’s an exciting vision. And the stories that Diamindis and Kolter share are each, in their own right, encouraging. To some degree the book reads like a “greatest hits album” of TED talks, Singularity University seminars, and X Prize competitions. As a source of exciting technology stories that is a darn good pool from which to draw. Of course, as a representative sample of the human race it’s a fairly limited pool of well educated, fairly affluent,
When we told the boys Logan of course was thrilled he understands everything and so watching him as been so fun. He wants another little brother. lol. London on the other hand was a hoot. We have always told the dudes that you can't have babies unless you are married. lol. May have been a mistake. So when I told London he says "mom who did you marry" I just looked at him and then totally got what he was thinking so I answered "your dad" he looks at me and says "again" and I say "yep AGAIN" lol. He is a little hoot. so I told him he could call aunt Brookie and tell her our news so he calls her and says " Brookie my mom is getting married" Brooke of course was confused. Then he says " my mom is getting married and having a baby GIRL" lol then brooke got it. London keeps telling everyone that we are having a baby girl, so I have to keep reminding him that we don't know what it is yet that is can be a girl or a boy. But he just keeps telling me no its a girl. So fingers crossed that he is right. Of course if it is another little dude we will be thrilled. I would never trade one of my little dudes. I love them so much.
(I think our group loves breaking the rules.)
From Monday evening, this week ’til Friday lunch we will be without both Declan and Emily-Jane. It will be just Phil and I in the evenings and me leaving an empty house all week during the mornings, from Tuesday ’til Friday (inclusive).
So that is the whole sordid story...I have heard depression is anger turned inwards...maybe it is and if so, I am one angry woman... Well meaning people tell me "move back to Oregon where you have family and friends." Any suggestion on how? I just keep stepping the steps so hopefully that is something that will become an option.
The last thing that I will note is that to overcome the obstacles of paruresis, positive mentality must be maintained. If it is not, failure is the only outcome. Paruresis is a condition that feeds of pessimism, and negative thoughts is the potent gasoline that fuels the fire. You have to recognize that there are going to be setbacks, and failures will be incurred. In many ways, I feel that failures can be just as valuable, if not more so than successes. Failures shows us what does not work. It acts as a process of elimination in finding the proper formula for recovery. When it comes to a condition like paruresis, it affects everyone differently, and therefore should be addressed differently for everyone. Each person have things that work well for them, as well as what does not work.
Who loves having extra cash in their pockets? I know I do! That’s why I try to save as much as possible on anything I buy. There are many ways to save money, but not everyone knows where to begin. As consumers, our best interest is to spend less to get more. My goal for this article is to help you find new ways in saving money that you may not have thought of. With that extra money, you could spend it on buying something else or put it in your savings account. But be wary: most of these methods require some time and dedication. So if you need something in a hurry, you probably won’t be able to save much.

It was just a routine trip to the grocery store. I left at about 10:00 on Sunday morning. As I was on my way to the Farmer's Market, I saw the blue lights behind me. Speeding...again. I pulled over into a church parking lot. I immediately picked up my phone and sent my husband a text. It said "I'm getting a ticket. I'm sorry." I gave the cop my license and insurance and waited for her to bring me my ticket. When she came back, I saw she didn't have a paper in her hand. "Thank goodness." I thought. Maybe I would be let off with a warning. As she came closer I noticed a pair of handcuffs. She came to the door and requested I step out of the vehicle. "You're being arrested for driving on a suspended license." What! For the next 5 minutes, between screams, cries, and a varie-tah of curse words, I told her I didn't have a suspended license. But she had the paperwork to prove it. I was handcuffed and put in the back of her police vehicle.

It used to be traditional to go into the forest and gather logs to burn in the hearth on Christmas day. This was meant to bring good luck and warmth to the family for the upcoming year. No important occasion would be complete without a cake and so this dessert was created.
there is NO ANY lack of food, energy and other necessities in the world ! there is sweet abundance of everything, or there are enough knowledge, skills and technologies to ensure that there is abundance, or at least TRUE SUFFICIENCY (by true I mean – not some FAKE concept for suppressing baan-nork peasants more than they are already, while elite continues their artificial luxurious lives and preaches to those peasants “self-sufficiency“). there can be enough FREE energy, or at least very cheap. as well as many other things – as CLEAN water, air, food …
The base was cut from wine coloured card and I used cardstock from the Love Letters set (First Edition Papers) for the outside of the egg. I edged the top layer pieces with Victorian Velvet Distress ink to add some depth.

A brief tasting of Bernard Delmas' wines at the Maison du Languedoc in London encouraged further investigation – I was particularly keen to try his oak fermented wines - so earlier in the month, we drove to Limoux and further down the Aude valley past the little town of Couiza to turn into the hills towards Antugnac, in the Haute Vallée de l’Aude. M. Delmas has smart spacious cellar, built in 2000, on the outskirts of the village, with capacity for the 30 hectares of vineyards he has in Couiza and Esparaza, as well as Antugnac. He has 14 hectares of Chardonnay, 8 of Mauzac, 6 of Pinot Noir and 2 of Chenin Blanc. As well as several sparkling wines, he also makes Pinot Noir and white Limoux from Chardonnay. He explained that he was born in Antugnac; he had trained as a cook, while his father had three hectares of vines and made a bit of Blanquette. After working in various restaurants around France, he married his florist wife from the next village and they expanded the vineyards. 1976 was his first vintage and he has been organic since 1986. There is a neat little tasting caveau – on the Thursday before Easter it was sporting a display of chickens, eggs and Easter bunnies. And we settled down to tasting.
While reading you’ll want to take note of the voice, the characters, the setting, the platform (for NF), the market viability, and whether or not the story intrigues you. It might not be something you’d normally read, but in this business you’ll need to learn how to evaluate a variety of books.
Since we were sticking close to home today in East Anglia (Grime’s Graves to Kings Lynn and the Castle Acre area), there was no need to race out the door which somehow led to a really sluggish start on my part. I’ve come to the conclusion that there really is no caffeine in the English tea, at least not as I’m accustomed to in the States. A cup of tea simply does nothing to me except make me feel warm and, yes, nice because it tastes good…with Splenda and milk.
What’s so good about this film? Not its $1-billion box office. Not its eight Academy Award nominations. The Dark Knight shines due to Batman (Christian Bale) and the Joker’s (Heath Ledger) chemistry. It is psychological and one of the most powerful pieces of writing seen in Hollywood. Batman, the face of justice, becomes an outlaw for simply helping the city.

I'm really looking forward to being able to teach with my favorite first grade teammate- Sarah. She and I have been teaching together for the past 4 years and we work together like we're one teacher! We do a lot of lessons and activities as a whole first grade, and we often find ourselves finishing each other's sentences. Last year, however, she decided to go 1/2 time to spend more time with her son, which was a great choice for her, and the teacher that came in for the afternoons was great, but I MISSED HER! I'm excited to get back to our old routine this year.
sometimes I wonder if it’s all my fault.

Faler loves making work that address objects and structures people come into contact with everyday and pay little mind to, with the idea that if she changes an aspect of it, even in a subtle form, that will upset the experience between person and place to a degree that person will actually notice place more than usual, thanks to the disruption of it.
Shortly after its founding as a hilltop epicenter of Zapotec culture in about 500 bc, Monte Albán became what is widely considered to be the first city in the Highlands of Mexico.
He sold because that’s what he did best. Some people knew him only as a musician, a singer, and writer of songs. Mick never straightened them out—part of being a master salesman is letting the customer think they know you, are comfortable with you. No one would ever have considered him an innovator in the musical products he packaged and sold since 1963 with various members of his sales team called The Rolling Stones. The quality of his wares varied considerably, with a noticeable decline in later years. In the fast changing tastes of the pop culture market place, he figured out how to stay active for almost 50 years, when others simply faded away.

Replace each of the irrational perfectaholic beliefs on your list, with a healthy, sane, empowering alternative. Write your new beliefs on a postcard and place it in plain sight wherever you create your work. Look at them often. Say them out loud. Repeat them. Chant them while walking. Visualize them. Integrate them into your life, until you believe the truth and see the lie of perfectionism for what it is… the devil that’s strangling your creativity and your success.

6. Moroccan Oil Conditioner: BEST. CONDITIONER. EVER. Makes my hair so soft, silky and NOT greasy I'm still amazed it hasn't become mandatory for women everywhere. It makes my hair so easy to run your hands through, and two days without washing is not even remote grease-ville. (I don't wash my hair everyday ever. It makes it like hay.)
Of course that could change. The day before yesterday we were talking about cashing everything out and buying a Tim Horton's franchise.
