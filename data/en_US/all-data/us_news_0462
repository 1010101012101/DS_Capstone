You can also purchase the hotel's bonfire and S'mores kit to take down to the beach, eight blocks away, for $65; though it's no doubt cheaper to do it yourself, the kit explains the specific regulations of where and when fires are allowed, which is handy. And while the ocean's always too chilly for me, basking in the year-round heated pool (80 degrees) is a beguiling way to prepare for one of the two dry saunas (separate ones for men and women.)

"My dad was stopping every mile and going over how much water I'm drinking, trying out his computer spreadsheet that calculates the sodium ratios. My dad's really getting into it.

It seems unlikely that they can make a big splash with a free-agent wide receiver, unless they first shed salary by releasing veterans like they did last summer with Derrick Mason and Todd Heap. However, even if they are not in the hunt for a DeSean Jackson or a Dwayne Bowe, those receivers being retained by their respective teams would dry up the supply of wideouts, meaning second-tier players would be in greater demand and their price would go up.

Inexpensive tradition: This idea is great for families with kids who have outgrown the traditional egg hunt. Each Easter, the Fitzgerald family of Scotia, N.Y. hosts a kids' party called the Great Egg Drop. The kids construct protective coverings for raw eggs, then they stand on a ladder and drop the padded eggs onto a target below. Their goal is to hit the bull's eye or outer rings without breaking the eggs, racking up as many points as they can in the process.

While some local business owners are concerned they will lose representation under the new ordinance, the city contends the ordinance will simply ensure the SID receives more money.

Steven, I don't see a chance. Hillis' 2011 season was a mess, and he and his agent were to blame for much of it. He was injured for a while, but his work, attitude and performances in games weren't so swell. He was a good kid when he was here, but something happened along the way. Hillis still wants a ton of money. The Broncos can get someone cheaper, and I expect them to draft a running back somewhere in the middle rounds.

City officials said the building's market value is $17 million. If the building ends up being used for a public department, however, the parts that are not privately rented would be taken off the city's tax rolls and the city and other taxing districts would lose $132,000 in yearly property taxes, O'Claire said.

I do worry about that. And I don't want to be preachy, so when we're serving customers, we ask, "Do you actually want to know any of this?" If not, if they just want ice cream, that's fine, too. We try to strike that balance. But I think it's important for consumers to look under the hood and kick the tires a little bit and make sure that the way something is marketed is really true.
For a quick introduction to Wellington's gourmet scene, take a Zest Food Tour (http://www.zestfoodtours.co.nz) sampling locally roasted at Mojo coffee, New Zealand cheese and olive oils at Moore Wilson's fresh grocery (where local chefs source their produce), tea with scones piled high at Martha's Pantry, many-flavored shards at Schoc Chocolates (salted milk chocolate!), and snacks and libations at other local bars and restaurants. Zest also conducts tours of the nearby Wairarapa Valley region, Wellington's equivalent of Sonoma, with boutique winery and pocket-sized vineyards, reputedly the climatic analog of Burgundy.

I know little about car repair, and when there's a problem, I want it fixed right away. My first car, a beat-up old Mustang, was a lemon -- sometimes it felt like I spent more time awaiting roadside assistance than I spent driving it. I vowed when I replaced it that I'd never drive an unreliable car again. So when the transmission failed for a second time on my next car, a 1994 Ford Explorer, I started shopping for a replacement, despite Gerry's desire to keep it on the road.

If your family lived in the city before 1906, you'll find their names, residential and business addresses, as well as occupations listed alphabetically in the sets of city directories on the fifth floor and in the San Francisco Room at the Main Branch Library.

Who could not marvel at Monday's action: the above-the-rim acrobatics, the deft shooting touches, the brute physical strength and hustle, the symphonic teamwork, the courageous comeback by another storied program, Kansas, that fell just short? From the White House to the corner bar, March Madness and the Final Four have become a springtime obsession because it's so exciting -- and because it makes so much money.
That's a fair question to ponder, because it runs counter to a fundamental of journalists' training. Rumor and innuendo are easier to spread in the text-message social media age than ever before, so should reporters specifically knock down at least the most patently untrue among them? I think there's a strong case sometimes.
"Governor Branstad has failed Iowa, and the American people," said Nathan Runkle the executive director of Chicago-based Mercy for Animals. "By siding with those who seek to keep Iowa’s corrupt factory farming practices hidden from public view and signing this bill into law, he has created a safe haven for animal abuse and other criminal activity in the state.

Among the sometimes data-packed paragraphs, "Going Solo" readers meet a host of engagingly profiled "singletons," the word Klinenberg coined for his subjects, each one an example of what living alone can look like. There's "bold and brazen" Ella, a lawyer who loves to travel and has perfected the art of the independent life. There's Helen, twice divorced, who declares that she was never more unhappy than when she was married and is thrilled to be on her own. And there's Joan, a senior who relishes her autonomy and wants to avoid being dependent on or too involved with her adult children and their families. These people are proof that living alone is not synonymous with being lonely.

His average dropped to .208 with Tuesday's hitless game.
Commissioner David Stern was at it again last week, lamely proclaiming that this season's wave of injuries is "not related at all - zero" to the 66-game condensed schedule.

With the Cubs holding their offseason fan celebration on the same weekend as the Cardinals, Theriot was a thorny topic for some former teammates. On the day of the trade to the Cardinals, the shortstop described how he was "finally on the right side" of the Cubs-Cardinals rivalry. He later told a St. Louis radio station that he was happy to be with an organization that emphasized winning World Series championships instead of them being "an afterthought." Asked about those comments at their fan fest, a few Cubs took umbrage. One suggested Theriot practice ducking.

Nancy Morith, an insurance broker and consultant who specializes in long-term care and has seen recent increases as high as 90 percent, says the carriers' biggest problem was a miscalculation of so-called lapse rates - the likelihood that some fraction of policyholders, because of budget constraints or other reasons, would willingly abandon coverage after years of paying.

At first blush, Mourdock seems an unlikely dragon slayer. The two-term state treasurer lacks the dashing presence of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the fiery rhetoric of tea party standard-bearers like Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and Florida Rep. Allen West. Before his 2006 election as state treasurer, an office that carries little name recognition, Mourdock's only political experience consisted of two terms as a commissioner in the southern Indiana county that includes Evansville.
Parkour (also called free-running) is a discipline developed in France that involves smoothly navigating over and around obstacles like walls, stairs and trees with jumps, climbs and acrobat-like moves. Zernow makes it look effortless, but it takes practice and discipline if you don't want to smack a wall or graze your knees on asphalt. Here's a move he recommends for beginners: the jump and landing. (Professional instruction for parkour is available at Tempest Freerunning Academy in Chatsworth, tempestacademy.com.)
WHAT HAPPENED: Yu Darvish kept the Tigers off balance with a mix of breaking balls and late-moving fastballs, Adam Wilk wasn't as sharp as he was last week in Chicago, giving up 10 hits and three runs in four innings. The rookie left-hander wasn't helped by his infield's defense -- the Tigers had two errors. But Wilk didn't nibble on the edges of the strike zone as he did in his first start. Despite all the early hits, the Tigers kept it a one-run game until the fifth inning.

Where do I begin? First, the framers never envisioned this type of judicial activism. This is grounded in the fact that until at least the 1930s judicial activism really did not exist.

In paying tribute to the pioneers of the farm worker movement, the Labor Department said the movement "took the very best of other social justice movements — including lessons from Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., effective civil disobedience and other peaceful tactics — and married them with modern strategies that involved consumers, students and effecting change by working within existing institutions.

At a time when we cannot adequately pave our roads, keep our libraries open or our community fire stations folly staffed, the very idea of doling out half a billion dollars for a sports stadium is out of touch with the realities faced by average San Diegans.

Chocolate cake ($7) seems to have won a permanent place among the two dessert offerings. The pie-shaped wedge has a crisp outer shell that gives way to a souffle-like interior; served with lightly whipped cream. Other desserts have included an exceptional creme brulee ($6); an almond, lemon and ricotta cake ($7) with big chunks of nuts and a dollop of whipped cream; and one of the best variations of tres leches cake ($7) I've had. This one was so good because it wasn't overly sweet and was balanced by a subtle saltiness that enhanced all the components.

Paul, the Cubs seemed destined to flounder around .500 this season, but they are starting to drop like a stone. How bad do they have to finish this season for the Rickettses to make serious changes in organization management personnel during the offseason? Clearly, the status quo strategy they have employed thus far hasn't worked and has alienated many of us. I don't see any change in the direction of the organization anytime soon. But I'm hoping you can tell me I'm wrong. Joe B, Grayslake, Ill.

Americans were shocked and saddened by the tremendous loss of life on Sept. 11, and by the unimaginable cruelty of those who planned and executed the attacks. But the more primal response was that of fear: fear that this assault on our basic sense of safety and security was just the beginning, that we would face more and deadlier attacks in the days and years to come. It came on the heels of the assaults on the U.S.S. Cole and on two American embassies in Africa, and it spoke to an escalation in a conflict we did not understand and did not know how to deal with.
It was a small thing, but during the recent iPad event, Apple executives said they were dropping the use of Google Maps in favor of an open mapping product. Hardly a killer, but it did start speculation about Apple's relationship with Google.

Susan is constantly doting on her "babies" (as she calls them). Her time is spent brushing them, talking to them, playing with them and photographing them. When we do have a little feline-free time, it's spent talking about them. I have grown more and more annoyed with these spoiled cats who have 100 percent of her attention.

For my final dish, it finally came down to a choice of the bone marrow ($10) or the pancetta-wrapped quail ($11). After tasting it I'd be hard pressed to imagine the marrow could be any better. I can't remember when I had a moister bird. The crispy, salty wrapping alone was memorable, but when paired with sweet bursts of roasted grapes, crunchy fresh hazelnuts, peppery watercress and the tang of aged cassis vinegar, it was absolutely brilliant.
It "strains credulity" that the trust would earn an investment return paying the price it did for Pumpkin World, said William Brown, visiting professor at the Duquesne University School of Law. "Zany with a capital Z," he said of the Pumpkin World purchase.

I think of "Cat in the Rain," perhaps my favorite of his stories, which in three concise pages portrays a marriage on the cusp of unraveling, without ever making that overt. The young American wife at the center of the narrative is dissatisfied but only aware of it as an undertone. As her husband reads, uninterested, she stares out the window of their Italian hotel room, then tries to rescue a cat caught in the rain. The story unfolds over the course of only a few minutes, but these minutes are intensely weighted, especially when the wife goes downstairs and runs into the hotel-keeper, an older man who is everything her husband is not. "The wife liked him," Hemingway writes. "She liked the deadly serious way he received any complaints. She liked his dignity. She liked the way he wanted to serve her. She liked the way he felt about being a hotel-keeper. She liked his old, heavy face and big hands."

Vetri is always improving his dining room, whether it's the exquisite new Venetian chandeliers or the extra space from a removed table that lowered the seat total to 30. But no change was bigger than a decision last year to jettison a la carte dining in favor of a $135 prix-fixe menu.

Michael Shermer responds:
The Air Force's only rival in the air is the U.S. Navy, owner of the world's second-largest air force. On the seas, the Navy is unrivaled but continues to add ships to the fleet. In this vacuum, members of Congress challenge each service to outspend each other, far beyond what is feasible for true national security. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted, "You've also got to take into consideration the national security threat that comes from the huge deficits and the huge debt that we're running." We cannot afford to avoid tough decisions when it comes to our budget. We certainly can't afford to give each branch of the military a blank check for weapons systems we don't need.

the grave," Mary of Bethany among them. But, what about the event in John's Gospel that takes place before the death of Jesus? What are we to make of this scene of anointing? It is important to know that at the level of social interaction and customs, Mary's lavish gesture is wildly inappropriate; she should not have been the one washing this guest's feet (that was a servant's job) and she certainly should not have used her hair as part of the ritual! The action, therefore, must be understood symbolically. Mary's anointing of Jesus points out that she was helping him prepare for his impending death, which is why it is so perfectly placed in John's Gospel.

* Where will Mizzou QB Blaine Gabbert go in the 2011 NFL Draft? Assuming that no red flags are raised when he works out and tests for NFL teams, we'll conclude that Blaine will go in the first round. There are a number of possible landing spots. Let's take a look, and keep in mind that this is just preliminary, and that a lot of things can change between now and the April draft. We're also assuming that Stanford QB Andrew Luck will enter the draft and be the top overall pick, to Carolina.

RB Brandon Jacobs. I mentioned in my early game story (which has since been wiped from the record here on the site, so I’ll reiterate in this space) you can say what you want about his running style over parts of the last two seasons while he was dealing with knee injuries, but his straight-ahead speed in the open field has never diminished. He proved it on a 74-yard screen pass for a TD against the Cowboys last year and again last night on his career-long 73-yard run. “When I went through my knee injuries last year, (speed in the open field) was never an issue,” Jacobs said. “My injury last year was a problem when I put my foot on the ground to make certain cuts and get in certain holes. My body just couldn’t do it. It was really painful.” The only pain Jacobs felt Monday was internal when he was tripped by CB Antoine Winfield and then brought down by S Madieu Williams. He said he just hoped it wasn’t a linebacker who caught him from behind. Relax, Brandon, it wasn’t.

The most pleasing topic from the spring so far has been seeing how the defense has come together. The secondary is not a surprise, they are good. Very good. They have experience and they have depth. Duron Harmon is a potential all-conference performer and there are two all conference corners as well. Lorenzo Waters is the same heat seeking missile that Harmon has been. Putting Waters at strong safety also allows him to use his mobility to get back in coverage and make plays as well.
