In fact, being too sensitive might be his undoing. Pro ballplayers keep score by money. When the Rockies showed outfielder Carlos Gonzalez and Tulowitzki the money before last season while ignoring Jimenez, he took it as a sign the team didn't love him. He's also incensed anybody in the Colorado organization could question his preparation for the 2011 season and irate at the whispers he didn't always give his best on the mound.

On the very first day in May of 2010 that BP began to use the "top kill" method to plug the leaking well, Katy estimated in a text to his supervisor that 15,000 barrels of oil per day were spilling - an amount greater than what BP said the method could likely handle. The "top kill" method involved pumping heavy mud into the blown-out well head to cap it.

Q: So, we want to start with a discussion of something that of course is very important to us and very important to the state. In late 2008, our newspaper published a front page editorial imploring Congress to leverage the considerable resources of the federal government to help save the auto industry. They did, two presidents agreed with that, and the result is very nicely reflected in the headlines this morning that GM is posting $7.5 billion in profit. You of course, had a different view. Our request of Congress was to invest in America. Your answer to that essentially was no. Tell me how Michigan and its leading industry would have survived if you had won that argument.

Jerry sought to instill his farm-bred work ethic in his suburban sons, once employing a mountain of dirt to do so. Disappointed his sons had not gone to the pool as promised and instead collected crawdads at a creek, Jerry had a dump truck twice the size of the family driveway pull up and unload a pile of dirt that was taller than the eaves of the house. He went to the backyard and, using bright orange paint, drew a circle. He instructed his sons to move the whole pile from the front to the back, leaving no trace of top soil on the driveway. It took days to finish.

The Greek government would still owe (EURO)330 billion ($428 billion), mainly to the other eurozone countries that rescued it, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. Because those debts would remain in euros, it would have no chance of repaying them — meaning it would have to negotiate forgiveness with international institutions adamant about not losing taxpayer money.

Page 198: A juror asks Chamberlin about the X-acto knife. "I think the average lay person would not see that as a deadly -- potential for causing death." The juror asks: "What would make that in your mind a situation that would make it justified to hit somebody with a gun, if it's an X-acto knife, that's probably not going to cause death, or is that assumption wrong?" Chamberlin says, "Yeah, I would disagree with your assumption. A well-placed cut with an X-acto knife would absolutely be lethal." He adds, "I'm not the knife guy, by any means, but I have read a lot about knives and knife attacks. And somebody who has an edged weapon and knows what he's doing with it is a very, very dangerous person."

The purchase of YouTube has provided a market price for the values generated by these videos. The purchase price indicates that Google expects to generate profits of over $150 million per year (if we assume a 10% discount rate and an infinite stream of revenue), which is not chump change. If Google can reach agreements with ASCAP/BMI for the music compositions, the sound recording industry for the music performances, the television and movie companies for any clips used, and so forth for the many copyright owners, then I suspect there will not be serious litigation. On the other hand, if it cannot reach such agreements then I think there will be litigation. There is too much money on the table for the copyright owners to not ask for some portion of it when their works are being used to help generate these revenues.

Now China is the dragon in the room. As of 2009, the country is the world's largest light-vehicle market (sales in 2012 are estimated at more than 18 million, compared with about 14.5 million for the U.S.), and the fastest-growing. The prediction blithely bandied about here at the Beijing International Auto Show was an annual car market of 30 million sales by 2020. Meanwhile, the premium-car market is, well, erupting is the only word, with predictions on the order of 15% to 20% annual growth for the next decade.

Also: According to Tressel, senior backup cornerback Donnie Evege, a valuable special teams player, will miss the entire season with a knee injury. . . . Sophomore Christian Bryant from Glenville was injured in Saturday's scrimmage and was rehabbing on the sidelines with his left shoe off Tuesday instead of practicing. His injury, coupled with the fact that senior Tyler Moeller isn't yet scrimmaging while coming off surgery on a chest muscle, led to redshirt freshman Chad Hagan working at the star position with the first-team defense. . . . The Buckeyes practiced in helmets and shorts, not full pads, but during the 30 minutes that reporters watched practice, defensive end Nathan Williams popped Herron with a hard tackle that drove him to the ground. . . .

NEW YORK -- JPMorgan Chase is shuffling the positions of three executives -- including the naming of a new chief financial officer.
USA Today takes a look at the impact of the continuing NBA lockout on Nike, Adidas and Under Armour, something The Oregonian and the Portland Business Journal did awhile back. But for The Oregonian story, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst of the NPD Group, did not state this potential impact if the season is wiped out: The NBA, he said, could lose up to $500 million in sales if the season is cancelled. Matt Powell of SportsOneSource -- who along with Cohen is the most-often quoted sneaker expert for these types of stories -- disagrees. Powell seems to agree with the Nike Lockout-era campaign slogan of "Basketball Never Stops."

The tone of Mr. Putin's presidency is certain to be different from Mr. Medvedev's. During the campaign, Mr. Putin took a hard line, attacking the U.S., rejecting calls for major political reforms and defending his populist and state-oriented economic policies as he played to his base of older, traditionalist voters.

We leave the restaurant around 11:30 and check out the party crowds around Old Town. Their excitement is irresistible, but eventually we return to the hotel. The festivities challenge our schedule.

Set to neoclassical works for harpsichord by 20th century Czech composer Bohuslav Martinù - conducted on opening night by Martin West - the candy-colored camouflaged piece feels larky, even goofy. Yet, the air between the guys dancing - an egalitarian mix of principals, soloists, corps members and one apprentice working together mainly in triads - is one of gentility and collegiality.
Diners can opt for a three-course menu for $75, with choices in each category (optional wine pairings, $45). But Kostow saves his most creative efforts for the $155 eight-course tasting menu (optional wine pairings, $105), which is what I chose on my most recent return visit.
"These are Draconian cuts," said Michael Podgursky, an economist who studies pensions at the University of Missouri. "For those that do work a whole career teaching in Illinois, it's a huge difference in pension wealth. So it's worth the effort to finagle the system in whatever way they can."
The 45-series tires provide much of the compliance to soak up small road jitters, leaving the suspension (struts up front and multilinks in back) free to cope with the larger energies of body roll, pitch and yaw. The end result is a small car with decent around-town ride quality combined with a feisty, lean and taut feel.

Another week, another gimmicky rom-com. In "What's Your Number?," Anna Faris plays a flustered young woman who freaks out when she realizes she's slept with twice as many men as the national average and decides to reconnect with her former lovers — with the help of a hunky neighbor played by Chris Evans — to see if any of them have the potential to become husband material. Though admirably raunchy, "What's Your Number?" is nowhere near as funny or true-to-life as the recent "Bridesmaids" or "Friends With Benefits"; it's more like a poorly researched women's magazine article mixed with a bad stand-up comedy routine. The DVD and Blu-ray prolong the torture, via deleted and extended scenes.
Following a second day of grilling about his views on everything from the teaching of evolution to school funding, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-0 in favor of Schundler’s nomination to the Senate, but noted it was doing so without recommendation.

Mr. Hawkins said that once the compromis de vente has been signed by both parties and registered with the tax authorities, the buyer has a seven day cooling-off period after which the deposit will be lost if the buyer pulls out. On the upside, you can't be gazumped at the end of the buying process, like in the U.K.

Driscoll, whose managerial ports of call have included Kraft Foods, Nestlé and Procter & Gamble, could be just the man for the job. In his most recent job, as CEO of Hostess Brands, he drew up an ambitious capital restructuring plan this year to bring the maker of Twinkies and Wonder Bread out of bankruptcy. But Driscoll was not able to get a buy-in from the unions to renegotiate their contracts and cut pensions, and he resigned in March. (On Friday, Hostess informed its 18,000 workers they may be laid off in the next two months.)

That's why Lewis' idea to finance a ballot initiative to legalize "medical" pot, for those who suffer from certain conditions, is timely. It should gain some traction and, perhaps, quiet support in powerful places, with state leaders in need of more dollars.
Outlaw signed a five-year, $35 million free agent deal with the Nets before last season, but struggled to live up to the contract, so it was no big surprise when he was waived.

Initially, the community college district chancellor and other officials contended that the series was one-sided and sensationalistic, and that the district, which serves 142,000 students, had completed many successful projects and fixed many of the problems.

The list of positive things fruits and vegetables do for skin is long, and starts with some intriguing news: Eating lots of 'em gives your skin a healthier, golden glow, compared with people who don't eat enough. What's "lots"? Our answer: at least five servings a day, but nine is ideal. Go for it! To really go for that glow, scoop up fruits and veggies high in vitamin C and beta carotene, the carotenoid that gives foods like carrots, sweet potatoes, red chili peppers, cantaloupe, winter squash, apricots and cherries their orange-red hue. Apples, too (Eve was right). Carotenoids add a 14-karat burnish to dark skin and a light "tan" to fair skin. (They also ease inflammation and protect vision.)

With no back story or brand name to give it an identity, the Cosmopolitan's novelty and design alone may not be enough to attract repeat guests. Yet the range of relaxing and entertaining options may. The Sahra Spa & Hammam is one of the best designed hotel spas I've encountered. Areas for dressing, grooming, showering or relaxing are expertly separated. The design also embraces you with gentle desert décor, including a large, warm whirlpool with waterfall, and a hammam, a treatment room anchored by an enormous, heated rock. It may be the only truly quiet place in the hotel. Serenity comes at a price: Most 50-minute massages cost $150.

The "reasonable accommodation" provision of the ADA requires that employers make job modifications for people with disabilities (diabetes is considered a disability under the Act), if the modifications help the employee perform the job successfully. For example, if your have an amputated limb you can ask that the work site and/or your work area be modified to allow for crutches.

In 2009, after imposing a 35-hour work week on other city employees to stanch the bleeding, Mayor Daniel Ursu's administration went to binding arbitration with the police union and lost. The cops got a salary increase and even won retroactive pay in exactly the kind of horror story often cited by supporters of state Issue 2. In part to cover those new contract terms, Ursu had to lay off five officers and the staff at the city jail. Other city jobs have been eliminated, cut to parttime or left unfilled as the city has sliced $2 million from its budget since 2008.

Master of carnage Jason Statham plays Luke Wright, a deadly mixed-martial arts fighter who's inexplicably working as a punching bag in the arena until he runs afoul of Russian mobsters. Then he has a chance encounter with a 12-year-old math prodigy who has been kidnapped by Chinese gangsters and sets out to become her protector. Writer-director Boaz Yakin proves the ideal enabler for Statham's brand of mindless violence. Together, they turn Manhattan into little more than a shooting gallery, stacking up corpses in service of a supposed story about one man's path to redemption. Rated R; strong violence, language. 1 hour, 35 minutes. By David Germain, Associated Press.

"My genealogy, like the tundra root we call the golden root, is enmeshed with its native soil. It does not spread very far below ground, as the permafrost is too near. And yet no hurricane could tear it from its native soil, no frost could wither it…." These stories, written by the son of the last shaman of the Chukchi people, whose villages once lined the shores of the Bering Sea, are so clear, surefooted, vivid and confident that it's hard to believe the people who passed them on so faithfully could ever be threatened by mere commerce. And yet their demise began with the commercial whaling that killed off their source of food and spiritual sustenance and continued with the race for gold that took prospectors up into the fragile Arctic tundra. The stories are an everlasting reminder of their relationship with the tundra, crags, lagoons, hummocks and with the animals. The Chukchi people believe the Earth was created from raven droppings; a little snow bunting poked a hole in the sky to let the sun in. The first woman bore whale-children and from them came the Chukchi people. These stories describe the marking of the seasons — the breaking ice, changing light, frost and drift. They describe the training of shamans; the passing on of rituals and healing skills. They are breathtaking, wild and imaginative.

Two years ago, the museum laid off staff and dramatically cut back on special exhibitions and programs to slice its budget by about 20%, from $32 million to $25.4 million.

But if this isn't the best the Kings can do, the Blues are in trouble. The Kings have the best record in the postseason at 6-1, and the six wins have been against two of the top three teams in the league in terms of points. For the second straight series, the Kings have won the first two games on the road, so they have a pretty good idea of where they stand.
Last week the Board of Trustees reprimanded Ammons over his job performance, including how the university has dealt with hazing. The panel that oversees the state university system has also called for a probe into whether school officials ignored past warnings about hazing.

Whether it’s “Oedipus,” “Elektra” or “Antigone,” Sophocles’ tragedies are no picnic. Written in the fifth century BC, they feature larger-than-life characters such as warriors, kings, queens and the occasional god or sphinx, not to mention incest, suicide and matricide. Their cosmic scale makes the characters struggle vainly against a predetermined fate. Unlike warnings about imminent Armageddon, dire prophecies pan out.

And yet, as much as "Binocular Vision" speaks to this displacement, it also contradicts it, in a sense. Although 18 of these stories come from Pearlman's three previous collections, all of the pieces here have been exquisitely arranged to make this book. Themes recur; narratives speak to one another — the effect is not so much of a sampling as of a suite. Of all the remarkable things about "Binocular Vision," this may be the most compelling, that it enacts a worldview in 34 precise and subtle movements, reminding us that if connection is elusive, there is nobility in perseverance, and that we are almost always greater than the sum of our parts.

The most obvious hurdle is language. Census data shows 63 percent of Fairmont City families speak a language other than English at home. But services in the community do not necessarily reflect that.

Critics say the program discourages newcomers from moving to Baltimore while depriving the city of money to help finance a meaningful cut in the overall tax rate.

Ross spent a year at Montrose, then left early in his senior year and returned to Jefferson.

More pertinent to Europeans and Americans alike should be the term that is cropping up of late: Made from Organic Grapes. Again, there may be too much wiggle in it, but for a vineyard to be certified organic it must have been free of synthetic chemicals and pesticides for several years. Thousands of producers around the world now have made the decision to forgo chemical inputs in their vineyards, and there are enough organic grapes that a movement is in full ferment.

But that task grows tougher on Saturday against a Stanford offense that ranks third in the nation in points per game (48.2), and first in the Pac-12 in both time of possession (33:17) and third-down conversions. The Stanford defense is also no slouch, ranking first in the league in total defense.

The split-second logistics of SEAL operations, not to mention the gear they have at their disposal, is also remarkable.

Sweeney said he favors civil service reform and arbitration reform, but believes the constitutional 2.5 percent property tax cap goes too far. He said closing some loopholes in the current 4 percent cap would continue a trajectory that brought average annual increases to 3.3 percent in 2009, from the 7 percent range several years ago. And wealthier towns would be more likely to vote to exceed the limit when they demand more services, he said. "Communities that have money override the cap. The middle class and the poor don’t. So the divide between the two becomes greater," Sweeney said.

The Devils' resiliency: The experts counted them out before the series even began, but that hasn't stopped this team. Neither did Ilya Kovalchuk's injury. The Devils trailed in the third periods of Games 1 and 2, but came back to either force OT or win in regulation. In Game 3, they gave up the third-period lead but didn't let it stop them from winning in OT.

Yet half a century after it was purchased, Gene Andal Park sits undeveloped and mostly unused  a monument to the county's misplaced priorities and legacy of neglect. This legacy includes Gibson Ranch in the north county, now closed to the public. Less known are purchased park sites, scattered around the county that  with some vision and leadership  could now be serving residents with playgrounds, amphitheaters and trails through preserved natural habitat.

But now Jones is healthy and is making the most of spring practice, going full throttle.
For all its control and poise, "Sweetie" has the restless inventiveness of a first film. (The heightened colors and off-kilter framing of Sally Bongers' cinematography are especially notable.) Campion has gone on to a varied and distinguished career — she remains the only woman to have won a Palme d'Or at Cannes (for "The Piano") — and, despite some partial misfires, she seems constitutionally incapable of making an uninteresting film. The Criterion disc puts her auspicious debut in context by including three terrific shorts that she made while at the Australian Film and Television School: "Peel" (1981) and "A Girl's Own Story" (1984), which anticipate the tangled family dynamics of "Sweetie," and "Passionless Moments" (1984), which prefigure its experimental narrative strategies.
Dutton is coming off a season in which he played in two games -- the Gladiators' first and last. At Spokane, he performed well before suffering a torn left Achilles' tendon late in the second half. In a playoff loss to Georgia, Dutton performed well off the bench.

Developed in part under the tutelage of former Cardinal and current San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh, Luck shows the advanced ability to read defenses and quickly run through multiple reads. He has a quick release, strong arm and compact throwing motion, and his low interception total speaks to his accuracy. A competitive natural leader, Luck's jarring hit on USC's Shareece Wright as the cornerback was running back a Stanford fumble Oct. 9, 2010, helped preserve the Cardinal's 37-35 victory.

"Most everything will get done, mainly by these incredible people who work here,'' Parker said. But he worries anyway. "I'm a worrier by nature, I'm always disappointed and dejected,'' he added with a laugh. "I'm cognizant of all the things that are left undone. My wife keeps saying, 'Focus on the things that are done!' ''

Meanwhile, Al Sharpton has been working both sides of the journalistic line, as both a news commentator and as an activist. Everyone from Bill Cosby to Mike Tyson to "Saturday Night Live" has weighed in. So has the NRA. Accusations of racism have been traded across the airwaves. Free-floating speculation is the norm on cable-news networks. Retractions and corrections have complicated the already emotionally charged story that touches on race, gun laws, privacy and more.
Ordering at Navarre can feel a bit like taking a quiz: checking SAT-like boxes on the regular menu, penciling in picks from the long, multiple-choice special list or pondering the fine print of the frequently photocopied wine list.

It's tough to absolve Dimon for the losses, especially since he had downplayed the size of the loss, calling it "a tempest in a teapot" during the company's first-quarter earnings report in April. "The price to pay historically has been the loss of the CEO's job," says Chicago securities attorney Andrew Stoltmann. "The board of directors will face a lot of pressure to throw Dimon overboard."
Weyn took two sick days off from her job as a school psychologist -- one day for the surgery and one day to recover. It wasn't enough.
Fister has been out since suffering a strained side two weeks ago today in his first start of the season.

No doubt many will write decrying a proposal to increase Maryland's gas tax. They will assert that taxes adequate to maintain our transportation system would impose an unacceptable burden on our citizens. However, they are complaining about a symptom, not the disease. They should be complaining about land use policies promoting sprawl and transportation decisions that starve public transportation, leaving our citizens with no alternative to continued addiction to gasoline.

Instead of limiting damage caps, politicians should focus on lowering medical errors and instituting insurance reform, suggests Goldberg. “Tort law has been very successful at creating safer products for the general public, and it’s doing exactly the same thing in the medical arena,” he says. “One has to review what the insurance companies are doing and decide whether it’s reasonable to regulate the insurance industry … rather than putting the onus on the injured person.”

Though many of the proposals will never become law, the proliferation of exotic policies gives Americans a sense of what tea-party rule might look like. Wisconsin Gov.

Guess who's coming to dinner: The other ladies tell Danielle it was inappropriate to bring "Cop Without a Badge," the book that revealed Danielle's unsavory past, to the finale dinner because there were children present, and because of the allegations in the book. Danielle says she didn't expect a knock-down, drag-out fight (much less tableware to go flying): "Maybe I felt like it would be a good idea to have them there so we would keep our voices down."
Ree is raising her siblings. Her mother, mentally ill and practically non-responsive, is of no help. Her father, who cooks meth, signed over the family's house and some forest land as bail, then skipped out; if Ree can't find him within a week, she'll lose the house and the land - and what little hope she has of keeping her family together.
"The wall is enormous, and that it survived 3,700 years – this is, even for us, a long time," Reich said. It was remarkable that a fortification of this kind was not dismantled for later building projects, he said.

* I think Hitchcock is right when he says the Blues are capable of playing better, still. An obvious area is being stronger in closing out games. Those two late San Jose goals in Game 3 were bad. And it did continue a disturbing pattern. In recent weeks we've seen the Blues fail to close strong and give up leads to Detroit, Chicago, and San Jose in Game 1. They also gave up late goals in the final regular-season game, at Dallas, turning a comfortable lead into a somewhat nervous situation. And that was the case Monday night. This must change, or the habit will eventually bite the Blues, and hard, at a bad time.

It's a popular idea because "everybody goes grocery shopping," Hamburg says. Plan your spree around a holiday, he suggests, maybe Mothers Day, so that people will try to win it for Mom. But the more time you allow for planning and ticket sales, the more money you'll make, he adds.
In the weeks since his son's death, the elder Champion said, other current and former band musicians have offered condolences, then whispered to him of their own hazing experiences. He and his wife, both 56, are working to set up a hotline so hazing victims can anonymously report their cases to someone who will investigate.
"Nobody really knew about him," said Mason's father, Rick. "In order to get on the map he really needed a good combine. His 40 time was actually bad for him. He ran a 4.65 up there, but he runs in the low 4.5's. A couple days earlier he ran a 10.95 (100 meters) at the West track meet, hand time, and ran 11.28 electronic time."

created was an apple wine made with apple juice. I'm not going to lie, I was quite skeptical of the result we would get when I participated in the making, and it didn't turn out the beautiful color I had assumed it would. However, it wasn't all that bad. Rather than try to perfect that recipe, we moved on to something more challenging. We decided to try a grapefruit wine. Now, in my mind, I had envisioned a wine that had a beautiful color tone with a nice, sweet, juicy, delicious flavor to it. I have a fabulous imagination.
