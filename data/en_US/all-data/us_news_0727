Top Picks Analysis: The Jaguars accelerated their offensive rebuilding plan by climbing up two spots in the first round to reel in two-time Biletnikoff Award recipient Blackmon, whose terrific hands, physical style and determined demeanor help offset a lack of high-end speed and have drawn comparisons to multiple Pro Bowler Anquan Boldin.

Albeit an unfinished product with only one year of sustained dominance in college, the 22-year-old can fire off the snap and has the frame to add more girth to be an effective three-down player. Smith followed with the curious choice of Anger in the third round, though the former Cal standout is a legitimate NFL-caliber prospect with excellent leg strength and hang time on his kicks.

They were peaceful and uncrowded, and the view from the top of their hill is picture-perfect Florence.

"I wanted a crack that had a certain energy and movement to it, in contrast to the straight edges of the pavers,'' Goldsworthy said. "I found that by hitting it from behind with a hammer, it imparted energy and unpredictability to the line.'' It's a balance of chance and control. "I'm very demanding of what I want, but the stone's very demanding, too. That's what creates the tautness and tension of the line. ... I'm enjoying the delicacy, the precision of this, the line. They're qualities you don't often associate with stone.''

He was bright, but he never lorded that over people."

For me, he and Crombeen, and Scotty, have really made themselves big time contributors here."
Those are good prospects for being allowed to stay here, said Kevin Crabtree, her attorney. But Velazquez and her husband have no legal status today, which is why getting their case shelved by the government was such a relief.

Hitler could not have put it better. But Adolf went beyond theory to actually implement Darwin’s prediction of extermination. I do not believe for a moment Darwin ever intended that his prophesies would be exploited by governments to eradicate untold millions in Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. But Hitler’s accelerated variation of “survival of the fittest” laid the groundwork for Nazi eugenics, as Darwin’s writings so accurately foresaw.

Keep them in a cool spot until shoots are about 2 inches, then move to a warmer location and watch them leap into action.

I almost forgot: Do not miss the sweet corn soup.

So if the practical application of biblical submission can vary so widely, isn't it reasonable to ask a presidential candidate what she means when she uses the term, or how it might influence her political decision making? If a candidate acknowledges that anyone or anything besides the Constitution serves as an authority over them, it's a legitimate area of inquiry for the electorate.

Twins catcher Drew Butera, who also caught two of Diamond's starts for Rochester earlier this season, said this was very similar. Diamond thinks his curveball is sharper this year, but Butera said: "Honestly for me, his curveball was just as good last year. I just think his fastball sets that up much better this year. He's throwing a little harder, and he's throwing more strikes with it."
As Democrats spent the days after the 2008 election pondering how to punish him, Obama came to Lieberman's defense and publicly suggested that there should be no retribution. Lieberman kept his chairman's gavel and became a reliable Democratic vote throughout most of 2009.

If the finger-thick asparagus from the Sacramento Delta is in season, you may see it over the course of a week simply roasted and served with ricotta, hazelnuts and a touch of lemon zest; sliced thin and tossed into a custard on a savory breakfast brioche; and tossed with tagliatelle and crunchy bits of pancetta in a springtime take on carbonara, crowned with a runny poached egg. You can judge the seriousness of a certain kind of Los Angeles restaurant not just from the date on which it begins to serve asparagus but also by when it shifts from thin to thick.

Bloomberg's Albert R. Hunt on why a confluence of controversial cases could make the U.S. Supreme Court a serious factor in 2012. Hunt notes that activists always talk about the make-up of the court, but the issue rarely resonates with average voters. Next year could be different, he suggests, at least if the high court rules on the health care reform, same-sex marriage, affirmative action and immigration cases now in the pipeline.

A draft of the ordinance says the police could cite or arrest the person only after the officer first gives a warning, then assesses whether that person is in need and makes "reasonable efforts to obtain assistance." Camping is defined as residing or dwelling temporarily in a place with shelter, which is any type of cover or protection from the elements. Public property is defined as any street, alley, sidewalk, pedestrian or transit mall, bike path, greenway or structure.

Pop Warner. I still get calls about a 2004 incident I covered involving an assault at a Santa Ana Pop Warner game by a coach upon a parent. I put a homemade video on my Web page.

Born in Los Angeles on Feb. 16, 1935, Price took informal trumpet lessons from jazz musician Chet Baker and drawing classes at Chouinard Art Institute while still a student at University High School. His first ceramics class came after graduation at Santa Monica College. In 1954 he transferred to USC, where he later taught, and in 1957 he enrolled at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now Otis College of Art and Design). There, artist Peter Voulkos had shaken up the ceramics establishment with muscular, monumental slabs of roughly worked clay that infuse Asian traditions with Abstract Expressionist bravura. Voulkos' slashed and gouged platters and brawny sculptures bucked the prevailing ceramic taste for refined harmonies between elegant form and punctilious surface.

Once I heard John Harbaugh used the words “asterisk,” “stained” and “New England” in the same sentence during a radio interview with 98 Rock yesterday morning, I knew what the reaction was going to be. Any NFL player or coach that says something even semi-interesting about Spygate or the New Orleans Saints’ bounty situation becomes a headline. Anybody who is perceived to challenge the success of Patriots coach Bill Belichick is going to be greatly scrutinized. I get it, as my old friend Buck Showalter likes to say. But did Harbaugh honestly say something that was especially revealing or untrue? Did he mount a personal attack on Belichick? No, what he did do was capture the reality of the post-Spygate world for the Patriots. Whether they like or not, there are going to be some people in the NFL – and plenty of fans – who believe that their three Super Bowls are in some way tainted. After listening to Harbaugh praise Belichick at every opportunity over the years and knowing that they have a solid relationship, I don’t believe the Ravens coach to be one of those people. I also don’t blame him for acknowledging the obvious: that Spygate – whether New Englanders like it or not, whether it is fair or not – is going to be part of the legacy of those Super Bowl-winning Patriots’ teams. It may turn out to be a very small part, but when all is said and done and Belichick calls it quits on his Hall of Fame career, his role in that scandal will undoubtedly be included in stories in his career postscript. As for Harbaugh, he probably could have chosen his words a little more carefully, but let’s be honest here: those remarks were rather benign.
"Given she's a special-needs student, they should've known that using physical force is not the proper way to discipline a special-needs student," he said Friday. "They should've been trained in some safe way of restraining her or discipline . . . that did not involve the use of force."

Ralph's comments stuck with me because they showed how the economic realities of a layoff affected a whole household. Ralph's attitudes about being a sole provider may seem quaint in the 21st century, but the loss of the income of a primary wages earner is more of a crisis now, where families already are spending two wage earners' incomes.

The Line 84 bus, which runs from Gresham to Boring, averages about four Boring riders per day. Until Sept. 6, the bus's schedule couldn't accommodate commuters who worked a regular 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift, only offering service in the early morning and early evening. Stephen Bates, the chief petitioner, said the burden the TriMet tax places on businesses was unfair considering most couldn't use the service.

But even if it can be confusing at times, frustrating at others - we have to wait a year to see what happens next? - and seems diminished on Shotgun's Ashby Stage, it's a voyage worth taking. As it progresses, the play more than sets the context for what's to come. It draws us into a world of feudal comfort, suffering serfs and intellectual ferment chafing under heavy-handed, paranoid censorship and the tsar's secret police.
Christie said the verdict should put other public officials on notice that if they amassed a pension based on the work of others, as Bryant tried to do, they shouldcall the state pension board and set the record straight before they get caught.

Pierre LeBrun, ESPN.com: "The St. Louis Blues didn't want to use injuries as an excuse for their second-round elimination. To a man, they stated that the Kings were simply the better team.

Reclining in his chair just to the right of the center, as the audience looks at the court, will be Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose seat near the middle is symbolic of his current role as the swing voter who decides many closely divided cases. Tall and thin, Kennedy will lean forward to ask questions and every single word he says will be dissected for possible clues about the final decisions. Kennedy will often display feelings in questions, but it's not a good bet to assume his pointed questions will automatically match his final reading of the law.
Even though this winter has been fairly mild in the mid-Atlantic region, the dangerous threat of the flu still exists.

The flu vaccine is still your best bet for avoiding the misery that accompanies the flu.

Fans of Mr. Jain see a man who shares many of Mr. Buffett's qualities. He is highly regarded by colleagues and rivals, and widely described as smart, good-natured and quick at cutting to the essence of complicated business matters. He forgoes the usual raft of consultants, modelers and lawyers that are involved in insurance transactions. His office in Stamford, Conn., with a worn-out carpet and a too-close view of passing commuter trains, belies the money his business earns for Berkshire each year. He is close to Mr. Buffett, and built Berkshire's reinsurance business from a tiny company in the mid-1980s into a behemoth today.

The young, budding artist found fiery inspiration in the "dangerous" American art of musical improvisation. "Jazz was synonymous with freedom and the artist atmosphere," Stanko said. "It was the opposite of bourgeois culture, the opposite of normal classical music and normal established society. Maybe it was fashionable because it was forbidden, but of course jazz music was also beautiful."

Myers described himself as a combo guard coming out of high school and prep school. He rotated at the 1 and 2 with Barton at Notre Dame Prep. But at Pensacola, Myers developed into a true pass-first point guard. Pena said Myers averaged 10 points and was a first-team all-conference selection for Pensacola (22-8). The point-guard skills Myers developed in junior college were good enough for one of the NBA’s greatest lead guards of all time – Isiah Thomas – to want him on his FIU team.

The pack caught Vichot and Minard with about 11 miles remaining, leaving only Marcato in front. But Marcato’s lead didn’t last much longer. A new group of five, featuring the yellow jersey of Voeckler and green shirt of Philippe Gilbert, surged ahead in the last six miles.
At the moment, this fledgling movement is awash in a range of demands. Occupy Wall Street has tended toward the amorphous, expressing a generalized rage at economic inequality and financial hegemony. The New Bottom Line groups, and the wonks of the anti-bank left, have more concrete demands, including modifications and cancellations to student and housing debt, a financial-transaction tax and the reinstitution of the 1932 Glass-Steagall Act (which would make garden-variety banking safer and less speculative by rebuilding the wall between commercial and investment banking).
Nathan Forbes, a principal in Gilbert's Rock Gaming LLC, seemed to leave no doubt while speaking in February at a program sponsored by the International Council of Shopping Centers and the Downtown Cleveland Alliance.
Maybe. But here’s the thing: where is it written than making the playoffs isn’t supposed to be a struggle? The Yankees are still as well-equipped and well-fortified to take on the 162-game examination as anyone; they are excellent up the middle ‹ name three teams that can surpass the Yankees’ Fab Four of Russell Martin, Robbie Cano, Derek Jeter and Curtis Granderson ‹ and deep in both the rotation and the bullpen.
Forty percent said they have "no idea" what their health care costs are likely to be in retirement. Only 8 percent were in the correct ballpark estimating costs of $200,000 or more. Another 51 percent estimated less than $200,000 would be needed.

Nobody has done more to bring authentic Italian cooking to Portland than Whims. Genoa, celebrated for staging evening-long bacchanalia feasts, was her baby for 20 years. Between kitchen stints, she was on pilgrimage to Italy, nosing around farmhouses and street markets or sitting at the feet of hero/mentor Marcella Hazen, the Julia Child of Italian cuisine, or perfecting wood-fired Neapolitan pizza in her backyard oven.
So the friends, who met in elementary school, brought their home cooking to Oregon.

In the main event, Sheamus teamed with "Mean" Gene Okerlund to face Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio, the two men gunning for "The Great White's" championship. Sheamus did a good job selling the match as a two-on-one encounter, but it didn't last long before the villains cornered Okerlund. At that point, all the legends poured out to the ring, distracting Bryan and enabling Sheamus to hit the Brogue Kick for the win. Post-match, the legends took turns hitting their finishers on Ricardo Rodriguez. The ending seemed appropriate for the two hours that preceded it; let's leave it at that.
What the Afghans hear from the current American president is a surge with an expiration date. An Afghan facing the life-or-death choice of which side to support can be forgiven for thinking that what Obama says is what Obama intends. That may be wrong, but if so, why doesn't Obama dispel that false impression? He doesn't even have to repudiate the July 2011 date, he simply but explicitly has to say: July 2011 is the target date, but only if conditions on the ground permit.
"It's the perception that you can have influence with the governor's office through this foundation," Leach said. He stopped short of saying the Jindals had done anything wrong, but said Jindal's fundraiser should at a minimum distance herself from the foundation.
This week, for example, I received a reminder from my medical group's pharmacist that Joyce's cholesterol is too high despite the medication she takes to control it. The pharmacist recommended switching her to a more potent drug. But when I checked online, the cheapest local pharmacy I could find was charging $120 for a month's worth of the recommended drug, versus $6 for her current one. I told the pharmacist that I would refill her current medicine and that we should recheck in three months to see if the price for the other had dropped. Should doctors really have to follow drug prices like market analysts in order to care for their patients? Welcome to the free market in healthcare.

In adapting Herman Melville's novella, Britten and his librettists - E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier - invented a prologue and epilogue in which Captain Vere, now an old man, reflects on the events of the story. In brief, a good-natured young foretopman, Billy Budd, is falsely accused by the master-at-arms, John Claggart, of fomenting mutiny. Tongue-tied, Billy strikes Claggart dead, and Vere - despite his conviction that Billy is innocent - feels he has no choice but to see him hanged.

Milligan had seen no signs of depression. Had she read Marissa's journals or gone on her computer -- to her, private places -- she would have learned that Marissa was thinking dark thoughts, had downloaded moody industrial rock like Linkin Park and tapped into a suicide Web site that romantically billed the Golden Gate Bridge as the Niagara Falls for ending it all.

I was dumbfounded as I read Steve Pokin's article on Chesterfield's pit bull ban. Does becoming a mayor or council member qualify you as a dog expert or would you need to consult the real authorities on the subject? If you took the advice of veterinarians, the Humane Society, the American Kennel Club, the Animal Protective Association, and even the American Society of Pediatrics, you would realize dog breed bans are ludicrous. As Randy Grimm of Stray Rescue stated in the article, "any dog can be dangerous, and on the other side of the coin, any dog has the ability to become a great companion." Kudos to the pit bull owners who left Chesterfield after this ridiculous ban.

Emma Donnan, because of The Indianapolis Star's presence in the school this year as part of its "Our Children, Our City" project, may appear to be extraordinary in terms of the issues it faces.

Understand this about Babcock: All he cares about is being the best. That's it. In that way, he is the perfect coach for this franchise. It would have been so easy for him to point out that the Wings were one of the best teams in the league at one point this season, or that their injuries came at the wrong time, or that maybe if Johan Franzen had scored one-tenth of a second earlier in Game 3, the series would have been different, or that even the best teams lose early sometimes.

I'm pretty sure I experienced some baby blues after my son was born. He arrived in November, which meant cold and flu season, so I didn't get out much. Since I had a C-section, I wasn’t able to drive for a while either.

A deep intimacy with Amina flourishes by revealing her life both in the United States and in Deshi. As she communicates in two languages, and we are keyed into her binary existence, Amina asks, "Was there a person who existed between two languages?" And this is the central question of "The Newlyweds": Can and will Amina reconcile her past self with her future self? Her story is one of the human heart in conflict with itself, which, according to William Faulkner, is the central conflict of all great art.

Nimitz High School's Robert Toomer, who coached Oregon receiver Josh Huff in Houston, said UO receivers coach Scott Frost was ethical almost to a fault. Toomer said Frost noticed Huff on another player's recruiting video and inquired about him. At that point, Huff was committed to another school. Toomer said Frost did not attempt to contact Huff until after Toomer called to tell the UO assistant that Huff had rescinded his commitment.
Metallica's members not only participated in group therapy to keep the band together, they also made a documentary about it. Axl Rose is so intensely loathed by former members of his band, he decided to skip the Rock Hall inductions. Being in a rock band is a lot like being in a marriage. All parties must learn to respect one another and make allowance for each others quirks and idiosyncrasies. Communication is paramount.

How Portland residents have quietly tolerated the lifelong harm done to thousands of its young people each year is harder to explain. Young adults without high school diplomas will forever find doors shut in their faces and will lose out on a half-million dollars, on average, in potential lifetime earnings. Has our city's famous laid-back tolerance of different life paths lulled us into acceptance as nearly half of our high school students go over an educational cliff?
That approach is being weighed in the Senate. It is one of the few proposals in any congressional legislation that analysts say would help reduce the nation's health expenditures, but it has come under fire from organized labor and has little support in the House.

After Sunday's 3-2 loss, Babcock told his players he didn't like a slashing call on Franzen, nor a cross-checking call on Kyle Quincey that put the Wings down two skaters. "I didn't handle that very good emotionally," Babcock said Monday. "When I look at the tape and I look at those penalties, they're both penalties. Stay out of the box. Real simple."

Hales: I think what I did well was look for partnership opportunities and make them happen. Here's a real specific example: Eloise and I, Ron Paul and Huo Baozhu from Xi'an, China, put together the partnership that brought the elephant statue to the North Park Blocks. It was an amazing experience that also turned out to be an amazing life changing experience for Huo Baozhu because he accessed leukemia treatment at OHSU as part of the friendship we built with him. So the combination of making Portland a richer place in our public art through that project and building a friendship that literally changed a man's life is probably one of the most amazing experiences in my whole life.

There will be an answer: Letty B, the midday DJ (10 a.m.-2 p.m.) on KMVQ ("Now"), has been named the Hottest Woman in Radio, according to Popcrunch, a gossip site that specializes in photos of attractive women. Letty, who was No. 26 in last year's poll, said, "The active social media campaign by my producer, Marcus 'Chunk' Bonfiglio, really made the difference." She added, "Last month at Stonestown, I ran into a woman who had won a gas card from me, and she was so grateful for it, she said I was so nice to her on the radio, it almost made me cry. It's great to help out and just be a part of the community here in the Bay Area."
The ballot petition, funded by retired investor and philanthropist Rex Sinquefield, differs from failed state legislation in two ways: It would give the city's civil service commission sole authority over department disciplinary matters and seal those records from the public.
In the first game it was a pitcher's duel until Terra Nova broke through to score first as singles by Nick Manessis and Justin Gubser were followed by walks to David Smathers and Nick Zygarewicz. Kurtis Casperson then cleared the bases with a triple staking the Tiger's to a 4-0 lead. Manessis (6IP, 2ER) pitched out of a bases loaded jam in the fifth, but Burlingame loaded the bases again in the sixth and scored on an error and were given another run on a great double play by Kodi Hudson when it looked like the runner failed to tag up before scoring. Despite this Terra Nova led 4-3 going into the seventh with hot pitcher Bobby Sehgal on the mound in relief.

"It's got a great beat and you can dance to it," or some permutation of that phrase, became the mantra of fan life during the "Bandstand" tradition of rating records. Three records would be played and members of the show's dancing brigade would give them a numeric grade anywhere between the odd parameters of 35 and 98. Clark would announce the average, and fame and fortunes could be decided with that calculation.

Greene has the best combination of skills of the three second base candidates and he's shown that in Grapefruit League action. His range is the best of the group, he has the best power and he's also the biggest factor on the base paths. The two left-handed hitters are more likely to show consistency when it comes to making contact but Greene is more likely to do damage with the contact that he makes.
Midge Purcell of the Urban League, participating in one of the small-group discussions, said that when changes are made on Williams it is important to ask who benefits from and who is burdened by those changes. If, she said, the African American community bears most of the burden of the changes, as it has at the hands of government so often in the past, "if the city doesn't respect the integrity of this public process and take into account the history of this neighborhood then the city will get it terribly, terribly wrong.”

The women who underwent these procedures were put in touch with Cruz-Dilworth by word-of-mouth at area beauty salons, said Assistant Prosecutor Peter Sepulveda, who is handling the case. Cruz-Dilworth would visit the women’s homes to perform the procedure. In one case, she did the procedure at her home, a gated community in New Brunswick.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest, one of the staunchest consumer advocacy groups, told The Times that the fuss over pink slime, which the center considers safe, is a "tempest in a teapot" given what else goes into our food. And ammonium hydroxide is a fairly common antimicrobial additive in many foods. Should we stop eating those as well? Or should low-nutrition, highly processed foods such as white bread be a bigger worry?
Trading volumes have been light for about two weeks in part because there has been relatively little news to move markets. Many companies are quiet ahead of earnings season, which begins in earnest next week.
But I prefer Ricky Gervais when he's set at "Scorched Earth." Maybe he's been spending too much time with the HFPA and actually starting to like their company? Or maybe the year in pop culture / filmmaking didn't give him enough insanity to work with. Either way, it was an uneventful night from the host - and when you're talking about Gervais, that's dissapointing.
A loudmouth passenger, realizing she’d lost her wallet, demanded to be let off a United Express plane in Des Moines, Iowa.
"He is politicizing the distribution of state aid," NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer said. "He’s dug his heels in on reinstating the millionaires’ tax, and instead he’s trying to use state aid as a lever to force middle-class school employees and teachers to pay the price for his priorities."
Zach Schiller, research director at the liberal Policy Matters Ohio, a non-profit research organization focused on economic policy, said Congress should maintain 99 weeks because unemployment remains high.
Sometimes, though, even identifying the goals proves a challenge. Indeed, getting agreement on plans for jobs, housing and transportation is the aim of a new planning process being launched by the East-West Gateway Council of Governments. The agency, which divvies up federal transportation money in the region, won a $4.6 million 'sustainable communities" grant in October from the Department of Housing and Urban Development - one of the biggest of these grants HUD awarded nationwide.
I'm not the only one who leans toward carefully ground meat. Erick Harcey, chef-owner of Victory 44 in Minneapolis, has a butcher shop doing a custom grind for the restaurant's burger. "We go through half a cow every 10 days," he said. "And we have a little bit of bacon ground into it." He uses the entire half cow in his burger blend, rather than a specific cut. "It feels like a more natural balance with that," he said.
“I think people underestimated us after that,” Tantillo said of the Curtis loss. “I think it showed that we can be beaten, but I don’t think we will again.”
What about the "land for peace" formula that has been the accepted doctrine of so many U.S. administrations? Does Mr. Landau think that formula is still valid? Not surprisingly, he does not, nor does he believe it ever was a workable formula. "The root cause of the conflict in the region," he says, "is the total refusal by Palestinians and Arab states to accept a Jewish state of any size."
"Today we are having a debate over whether to eliminate wasteful, duplicative spending and unnecessary, flawed federal programs" or to let automatic cuts "disarm our military, disrupt their operational capabilities, and shrink America's fighting force," said Rep.

CHICAGO - Whether the opponent for this year's playoffs was the Miami Heat or Chicago Bulls, none of it would matter if the 76ers had been playing the type of basketball they displayed from the last half of February to the middle of April, when they went 11-21 after a 20-9 start.

Paul also aspires to eliminate no fewer than five cabinet departments within the federal government. And the Federal Reserve System to boot. Not reform, mind you. Extirpate. To enact even half of Paul's to-do list would turn this country on its head.

Meanwhile, brush onion slices with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill, turning occasionally, until soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Also put poblanos and fresh jalapeños on the grill and char on all sides, about 8 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then peel off the skins and stems and seed. Cut the peppers into strips. (In Mexican cooking, "rajas" refers to strips of chilies.) Once the onion slices are cool enough to handle, separate rings.
Perkins speculated that if World Peace "could go back and change the hands of time he would take that play back," and added, "It's just not good for our league, especially on a national TV game.

Because of their concerns, these characters are distracted. Or, at least, that's the implication. "She's just sitting there," one character says after the first attack, as Katrina, wounded, gathers her strength in the complex courtyard. "She might be hurt. I think I see blood. Maybe we should call the police." Another replies: "I'm sure someone already has. We shouldn't tie up the lines."

I'm excited to see how Ryan Pore, Mamadou "Futty" Danso, Kalif Alhassan and Bright Dike blend into the squad (Dike after he returns from injury). And I'm excited to watch Kenny Cooper and Darlington Nagbe score some goals for the Timbers.

Dreaded to waken for no good reason,
Pardon my pragmatism, but I'm fine with the Brockers selection for a several reasons; (1) defensive tackle was on my list of priority positions; (2) run defense has been a horrible weakness on this team for several years; (3) Brockers has received strong advance grades for his ability to stop the run; (4) Rams coach Jeff Fisher had a reasonably successful track record of drafting and developing DTs in Tennessee.

Buy me a meal every now and then and not snore, you're a perfect roommate." He later playfully retorted: "If you want it to be personal, I was a better player. How many years did I play in the league? How many years did he play? I played over a decade. He played three." ...
