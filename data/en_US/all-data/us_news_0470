"He was probably upset about the fact it was an interception," Tressel said. "In the heat of the game, when you're screaming or yelling at each other, there's no place for the meek and mild. You need to be screamed at and you need to scream. I don't know if I was screaming at him or he was screaming at me or we were screaming at each other, but we still love each other."
He said he stressed to Hillis -- who missed practice Wednesday and Thursday with a pulled hamstring suffered in the Raiders game -- that the best way to increase his value is to play well.

On one of these lovely spring evenings, this 2010 Arneis makes a perfect aperitif. It's light and refreshing, perfumed with white peaches. And yet there's an underlying minerality that gives it some weight. Never one-dimensional, Almondo's 2010 "Vigne Sparse" Arneis is one of the best I've tasted. It's dangerous to open a bottle too soon, though: It may not quite make it to the table.
Once immigrants are offered discretion, they must undergo background and national security checks before final approval.
Before I continue, it might be good to acknowledge some context. Here we are in the 21st century, at a moment when retro hippies—nudist retro hippies—will be cavorting on thousands of multiplex screens across the country. And here I am hailing a film, in Albanian with subtitles, made by an American from California, about a family confined by a feudal code to its rural homestead after an ancient land dispute with another family suddenly explodes into violence and death.
The overall economy grew in the third quarter of last year, and many economists believe it grew even faster in the final three months of 2009. They worry the economy will start to slow again unless people step up spending.

The city prohibits right turns on red at the intersection of Fowles and Engle roads. That restriction stops Dychko virtually every day and forces him to wait out a traffic signal before returning to Berea to enjoy his java. "It irks me to no end," Dychko said.

One type, the little brown bat, "was the most common bat in the Northeast and typically the most common bat in the nation, and they've been just completely decimated," Coleman said. In some areas, "we're down to 3 percent of the original population."
The crowd cheered as the walk officially started at 9:30 a.m. In fewer than 10 minutes, thousands of people passed through a pink-and-white balloon arch. Almost an hour later, teams began to climb the final stretch, an uphill road named Winning Way north of the Rose Garden. Mobley Jiganie cheered as each person crossed the finish line. The Vancouver woman discovered she had Stage IV bone cancer in July and was told she had six months to live. Ten months later, a medical study continues to keep the disease at bay, she said.
Brown and Portman had discussed the idea and then Rep. Steve LaTourette, Republican of Bainbridge Township, worked to herd his House colleagues into the bipartisan spirit. His spokeswoman, Debbie Setliff, says that as of now, the Ohio delegation has reserved the last two rows of seats on the Democratic side of the House chamber.
Todd Jaycox, a senior vice president with Resource, said the company plans to attend the foreclosure sale and bid the note. "We expect to be the successful bidder, but of course, we cannot predict these things," he said.
A new poll released Monday by the Pew Research Center suggested the brutal GOP nomination battle is helping Obama solidify support among Democrats. The survey found 49 percent of Democrats say that as they learn more about the GOP candidates, their impression of Obama is getting better - up from 36 percent in December. Just 26 percent of Republicans say their impression of the GOP field has improved as they have learned more about the candidates, largely unchanged since December.
The events are more than four decades past, but what unfolded over the long, hot summers of the late 1960s continues to reverberate today. Here in Detroit, rage over inequality boiled into the streets in July 1967. Less then nine months later, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, where he was supporting a strike of sanitation workers. Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy announced the news of King's death that night to a largely African-American audience in Indianapolis: There is video of him nervously fingering the paper of his speech as he speaks of fatal violence affecting his own family, too, and issues a call to "make gentle the life of this world."
Many orb web spinners made additional improvements. Instead of equipping their webs with capture threads made sticky by the time-consuming cribellate combing method, these spiders produced a new kind of capture thread. It was much more stretchy than cribellate silk, and it came out of the spider's body already coated with glue, eliminating the need for combing.
A trial last year ended in a hung jury. During the trial, prosecutors sparred with U.S. District Judge William Martini over his decision to exclude some evidence.
Spicuzza reportedly sent an email to the Sacramento Bee in which she said the spraying and investigation led to her departure.
"We believe this decision violates my client’s state and federal constitutional rights of free speech," Vella said. "What’s important is that the state could say there is nowhere for you within your relevant market area and you have to do it in another state."
Schmuck: If you ask your fans, "What is Cal Ripken's greatest accomplishment?" they all would automatically go to that moment, and maybe you would have that day, but do you have a different perspective at 50 years old? What do you think is your greatest accomplishment of your first 50 years?
Saklad said the new Muppet Theater set was put in storage after production on "The Muppets," just in case it's required for a sequel, and he's hoping that no one paints over the "Phantom of the Opera" walls. However, the prospect of The Muppets as a rejuvenated franchise featuring Segel is one the actor-screenwriter can't seem to fathom.

The seismic areas of the Garden State are similar to those of Virginia — and the last major one was in 1884, a magnitude 5.5 centered off the coast of Sandy Hook, which pulled houses off their foundations. In geologic terms, that means the state can expect one like Virginia’s Tuesday trembler any moment, likely in the next 20 years, Gates said.
Harris developed a blade for the drill tip that the machine uses to punch out follicles without damaging them and licensed it to Restoration Robotics Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., the company that makes ARTAS. His office is one of two that tested a prototype of the machine.

The Ohio State basketball team doesn't travel in rickety buses or have to scrub down its gym. But the Buckeyes, who practice and play in first-rate facilities, still had to wait for improvements that had been talked about since 2007.
The lack of a Cobalt inventory buildup is a strategic shift at GM, said Merkle of Autoconomy.com. When GM redesigned the Chevrolet Malibu for the 2004 and 2008 model years, the company not only built up inventories of the older models, it continued to build and sell them to rental car companies as the Malibu Classic after the new Malibu debuted.
To win, Canada withstood a remarkable and determined effort from a U.S. team that wasn't supposed to medal in Vancouver, much less roll through the tournament unbeaten before losing in the first overtime gold medal game since NHL players began participating in the Olympics in 1998.

The room from which that message was sent, 3420 Boelter, had been modified a great deal in the intervening decades, but a few years ago a graduate student in history at UCLA, Brad Fidler, suggested to the engineering department that it consider re-creating it as it looked in 1969.
Lee's memo was at odds with a 1996 report by another PG&E employee, Bob Becken, who was assigned to study the effectiveness of remote-control valves.
“It’s a great experience for kids who haven’t been there, for the kids to see how our city legislature works,” Boys High assistant track & field coach James Johnson said. “They were amazed and awed with how the format was.”
Fang Peiyan is a character. “A friend once asked me, ‘Why are you working so hard?’ ” the colorful owner of Mr. Pi’s says. “Why? I have to pay the freakin’ rent!” Yes, he really said “freakin’,” and Fang seems equally comfortable in his roles as standup comedian and sushi master. His sense of humor spills over onto the menu, dotted with the Dynamite roll, the Ben roll, the Beth roll, the Salmon Knockout, the Refreshment roll and, naturally, the Pi roll. There also is the VCR roll; the story behind it somehow involves a man, his ex-girlfriend, a car and a stereo system, in roughly that order. One of the best items on the menu is the Spider roll, with wondrous little bits of soft-shell crab. Save room for dessert. The mochi — strawberry, vanilla, red bean, mango or green tea ice cream inside egg-like rice dough shells — are highly recommended. And the fried banana is an ooey, gooey delight.
Today we reveal the winners of the 14th annual Foodie Awards, our readers' favorite places to eat and drink in 2011. We added nine categories, including best food truck, bar menu and coffeehouse. Of course, I noted my picks as well. But the main focus is your take of what's hot in the Central Florida dining scene.
Kasriel always has delivered astute observations about the economy, particularly about the role of the Federal Reserve and the impact of bank credit, or lack thereof. He correctly foretold the depth of the recession because he understood its origin, a bubble of bad debt. Accordingly, he gets the last word.

"It's a shame for the kids and for the parents who don't have a car," Farias said. "How are they supposed to get back and forth?"
To that, Randolph suggested that his Republican peers' worries about upsetting children was both newfound and selective: "I don't remember this party caring much about the kids whose parents were between jobs on the day they described the unemployed as lazy bums looking for a handout."
It wasn't so bad, really. Boredom was more an issue than fatigue. Other than that, the only real discomforts were a jellyfish sting and an unsatisfying liquid diet of carbohydrate drinks.
The G-20 meeting of finance ministers is adding some caution to the market, which has been volatile throughout the week. Shares dropped early in the week because of global economic concerns before recovering in recent days following the string of earnings reports.
There are no easy fixes. Child abuse and neglect is a complex problem, usually rooted in poverty, drug abuse, mental illness and generations of family dysfunction.

and the administration of Mayor Francis Slay. The issue had become embroiled in North Side politics, South Side politics, mayoral politics, aldermanic politics, agency politics and interest group politics. Some of the fighting involved $250,000 that city residents donated - in vain, it turned out - to help pay for a new state-of-the-art stray shelter.
Reports of "green pools" -- swimming pools at abandoned homes, green with algae -- were up 45% in the first three months of 2008 compared to the previous year, officials said. Those pools "are almost guaranteed to breed mosquitoes," said Kelly Kersten, a county environmental health technician. He said West Nile virus is a concern.

What's more, 41 percent of the respondents said they expected their firms to raise prices in the third quarter.
None of the children went into the family business. The eldest, Catya, an actress and model, died in her sleep on New Year's Day 2002 of an accidental overdose.
"This is what I've found over time. I've been fortunate to coach lots of good teams that played a long time in the playoffs and lots of times after Round 1, the guys you think would score more don't have any, but by the time you're done playing three and four (series) they have lots. That's why you have a team."
TVF&R crews were called to the home, in the 13000 block of Southwest Second Street in Beaverton, about 2:30 a.m. Upon arrival, firefighters found that all five occupants were outside the single-story home, and smoke was coming from the residence's eves, Ulven said.

Donated by Brown to the private university in 1985, the records touch on a unique span of California's history: Brown's handling  some say mishandling  of the Mediterranean fruit fly crisis. His fling with singer Linda Ronstadt. His pummeling over Proposition 13. The gifts he promptly gave away  most of them, anyway. And his frugal lifestyle.
‘‘They're yelling for everyone,'' Couples said. ‘‘I wish a couple of them would have come out and played a few shots for me today.''
The Fenton facilities formerly housed the headquarters of Eagle Industries, a company founded in 1982 that ATK acquired in 2009. At the time of the acquisition, Eagle employed 2,300 people in multiple locations.
His on-again, off-again suspension in the later instance made him a symbol of an organization in disarray. He was considered to be a diminished player and an enhanced distraction. It was the classic formula for a player whose trade is excused as "addition by subtraction."

Forest Grove, which has struggled with a shrinking enrollment over the past couple of years, lost 68 kids overall but may gain some after it opens seats to neighboring districts.
There is no known cure for HLB. The citrus board has long had a photo of the Asian citrus psyllid on its website labeled with "A Death Sentence for California Citrus."
Most of the 19 people indicted were members of the 500 Block and C Street Norteño gang factions based in South San Francisco, federal prosecutors said.
If the economic recovery continues to limp slowly, as it has in the past two months, Republicans say voters will become more open to Romney's campaign.
That plan had helped lift spirits briefly, but markets were quickly roiled again by worries that the U.S. economy may be sliding back toward recession.
The state currently imposes a 4 percent property tax cap, though towns can appeal for exceptions. Christie’s plan is stricter, allowing towns an exception only if their voters overrule it by referendum.

The Register stories exposed a culture of exploitation inside USA Gymnastics. Signs of sexual or physical abuse of young athletes were often ignored. Even when coaches were investigated and banned by USA Gymnastics, some continued to coach children in non-member gyms.
He played the first five holes at 4 over before steadying himself with two birdies. He finished at 2 under and doffed his cap to a crowd that still loves him. He'll have one of the later tee times Sunday — probably not to contend for the title, but certainly with a top 10 in reach on the 20th anniversary of his crowd-pleasing win at Augusta.
"So we need to figure out a humane and practical way to deal with this problem - not one that makes a good sound bite but has no chance of success. I am committed to come up with some alternatives. I know that most Americans don't like the idea of rewarding lawbreakers, so whatever solution we come up with will have to carry heavy penalties for those who've broken the law.

Family members declined to comment on the accident.
It could be that he was spooked by his wife's accounts of ill treatment and an isolated night in the hospital, or swayed by arguments from supporters who think he will be safer leaving China. U.S. diplomats have promised to monitor Chen's circumstances to make sure Chinese authorities keep their promises.
At the scene of the crash, Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield said he could not say whether the two helicopters crashed into each other. He said the cause of the crash will be determined by the investigation.
"Just after the Civil War, an enormous amount of stuff was built on Main Street - and big things, not just big for St. Charles," Pitman said. "Maybe there was a sense of optimism that the war was over and it's time to build the country."
PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1
In context: The offense and team record regressed to 4-12 under first-year coach Shurmur and McCoy, who was handed the starting job from Day One. Rookie mistakes and uncanny slip-ups cost the team probably two or three wins. If building through the draft is the road to success, the Browns have a nucleus of first- and second-year players on which to build, namely defensive backs Joe Haden and T.J. Ward, defensive linemen Phil Taylor and Jabaal Sheard and wide receiver Greg Little. The team's 2011 draft class started a combined league–high 66 games.

A bonfire was lit on the unseasonably cold evening, and guests ate and talked until 11 p.m. "A lot of people commented that they loved the way it worked," said Rix, 28. "It gave everyone a full day of spending time with each other."
Molly was a truth-seeking missile. She was a devil and an angel and a spiritual chop-buster who went after anybody who got in the way of a better world. Quite often she towered above the people she wrote about. They, as likely as not, were merely the slick, lubricated heads of well-oiled political machines; she was a dreamer, a little girl lost at the county fair, who somehow grew up to be a brave and bawdy and brilliant ball-buster in a state where men have always been men and emus have always been nervous.
For eight Monday evenings in the summer, 33 union members attended the candidates school run by the North Shore AFL-CIO Federation of Labor. They learned the nuts and bolts of running for office, like tips for fundraising and getting volunteers. They also learned what issues were important to other unions. Teachers are against tuition vouchers. Construction trades want project labor agreements, in which the government awards construction projects only to unionized firms. Public unions are against privatization.

Edgarton Memorial School has been owned by the Newfield School District, a non-operating public school district with a tuition agreement with Buena Regional School District until this year. More than two years ago a judge dissolved the agreement between Newfield and Buena and ordered Newfield’s students be sent to nearby Franklin Township elementary and Delsea Regional high schools.

At many small-plates restaurants, the finer points of service are ignored, but at Zarzuela the waiters are as friendly as if you are a regular customer and as efficient as if they worked at Gary Danko. They always bring new plates, utensils to serve the shared dishes, and pace the selections so that there's never an overload of plates on the wood-topped tables.
"Coming from the inner city of Detroit, it was like culture shock for me. It was beyond night and day," said Barthwell, who would go on to finish a bachelor's degree at Wayne State University and attend Harvard Law School at the same time as President Barack Obama. "I would have rather gone to Cass Tech. I was a basketball player and wanted to play in the public school league. But Cranbrook was a tremendous educational experience for me."
This is the place to get proficient at "steep and deep," local parlance for steep runs and deep, smoky, up-to-your-elbows powder, especially if you want to tune up for a week of helicopter skiing in Canada.

Senior Geralen Stack-Eaton led Alabama's floor exercise with a 9.950 after scoring a 9.975 on the vault. Diandra Milliner added a 9.950 on the vault as Alabama's 49.625 topped the strong 49.525 vault total posted by UCLA early in the day.
"The federal government simply does not have the right to force someone to buy a product -- be it health insurance or any other type of goods or services that an individual may or may not want -- or face a penalty," agrees Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a former Republican U.S. Senator who spent his first day on the job adding Ohio to a lawsuit that Florida filed to challenge the law.

You lay a hardwood court next to the conning tower on one of the U.S. Navy's most fabled aircraft carriers and host a season-opening basketball game the Friday before Veterans Day. Boeheim is on record saying he doesn't think college athletes handle the cross-country trip well, but he'll load a young Orange team on a plane and venture into the great unknown of the Pacific time zone for this.

There is no doubt that, in hindsight, Lake Ridge should have been more aware of how the perception of eight or nine students (who all played one sport together) enrolling at the same time might be perceived. With that said, OHSAA should have made the inquiry at the beginning of the academic year in August and not waited until now (almost the end of the school year) to insinuate impropriety. This unaccountable board did not even have the decency to contact Lake Ridge Academy to inform them of their "rulings." Instead, the community, including the administrators and basketball coaching staff, had to read about it in the newspaper.

"No doubt plaintiffs would have loved to have gotten more; certainly their counsel had every incentive to get as much as possible. ... Honda undoubtedly has many arrows left in its quiver, and certainly would have preferred to pay nothing," he wrote.
Moyer and McGraw are old friends, so the professor visited the society's office last summer to give the collection a look. That's when he experienced his eureka moment with the King James Bible, which dates to 1611. The Bible is identifiable as a first edition because in the Book of Ruth, a passage refers to Ruth with the pronoun "he" rather than "she." The error was quickly corrected in a second printing.

Hallinan now says Harris was a good lawyer and a good district attorney. She defeated him, he contends, because "she got Willie Brown on board." Harris is not alone in disputing that view. She noted that she raised large sums on her own, distanced herself from Brown and ran an aggressive campaign against an incumbent who had the state's lowest conviction rate.

Saariaho's "Orion," heard immediately after intermission, is a 22-minute piece in three movements inspired by the mythical personage of its title, in both his earthly and stellar forms. Its first two movements ("Momento mori" and "Winter Sky") are foggy, surreal and bendy, a steady ticking pulse (set down by harps, percussion, bells) and mechanically reiterated scale passages lending a nervous quality to the prevalent gloom. Low thrums hint at power held in check, but it occasionally comes crashing in waves. This is essentially floating music, galactic, the motion the sparkles of stars.

Mayor Francis Slay proposed restoring the pay matrix to officers as was agreed to under the first-ever collective bargaining agreement. He said sergeants and above receive minor raises anyway, and excluding them would offer some cost savings.
Federal law punishes employers for hiring persons not lawfully in the U.S. Arizona's statute prohibits a person not lawfully in the U.S. from seeking work and makes it a crime. Is that a conflict, or an acceptance by Arizona of the invitation from Congress "to participate in the process of enforcing federal immigration laws"? If the high court wants to "balance" its decision on SB1070, this part of SB1070 is the most likely to be found in conflict with federal law, though that conflict is certainly debatable and unclear.

By the second week, conditions began to deteriorate. On at least two occasions, American Medical Response (AMR ambulance company) was denied access to provide medical care. The Oakland Fire Department and Police Department were denied access to the Plaza to respond to calls for service. The City also received reports that an individual was severely beaten. Sanitation conditions worsened with frequent instances of public urination and defecation, as well as improper food storage. The existing rodent problem on the Plaza was exacerbated and vector control was unable to implement measures to control the rat problem due to the presence of overnight campers. The Plaza was physically damaged on a daily basis by graffiti, litter, and vandalism. Fire hazards continued unabated, including cooking with open flame, improper storage and disposal of propane tanks, storage of grease, inadequate fire extinguishers, density of tents and flammable materials, and smoking in tents. Specifically:
Thorpe, a Detroit native who moved to Atlanta when he was 4 or 5 and still has family in the area, is one of the new breed of safeties, a converted cornerback whose man-to-man skills should make him the target of some safety-needy team on Day 3 of the draft.
Finally, there are shows like AMC's "Mad Men" that we can't stream during the season. We could download them from iTunes, but the season costs about $35. So we'll wait for them to appear on Netflix at some point. Same for shows from HBO, which we usually have to wait a year to get on DVD.

Manningham to hit market? Giants receiver and Warren, Ohio, native Mario Manningham, who made a spectacular catch on the Giants’ game-winning touchdown drive at the Super Bowl, is likely to hit the free-agent market and the Browns could be interested. Giants General Manager Jerry Reese made no promises about being able to re-sign Manningham, who is represented by Drew Rosenhaus. “We’d love to have him back, but we don’t know what we can do with respect to that,” said Reese. “He’s a good football player and obviously players, when free agency comes around for them, they want to make as much money as possible. We’ll see how it unfolds. We’re glad he’s been a Giant for us and his contributions are outstanding for us in the time he’s been here.”

There are no allegations of terrorism in the Demographics Unit reports and the documents make clear that police were only interested in locations frequented by Muslims.

The narrative doesn’t stop when the album is over, either. Shires intends to make videos for every song on "Carrying Lightning." She’s already uploaded clips for the darkly humorous "When You Need a Train it Never Comes" and the devastated "Lovesick I Remain" to YouTube; "Shake the Walls," the obsessed, wildly thumping heart of the set, will be next. No video substitutes for the real thing, though, and music as intimate as Shires’ is best heard in a live setting.

Of course, true believers can be the most dangerous kind, can't they? There are places in The Sword of the Lord where it was difficult for me to not see Rice as the enemy of what I believe is the gospel.

"I'm not usually in the business of predicting or projection ratings, but I think it's all going to come down to how close the games are," he said on a conference call this week. "I'm not going to say, 'We're going to do a bad rating because we have two teams from mid-majors.'

The Strongsville brewer does a lot of things right -- food, on-site brewing and, of course, beer. As with any good porter, this is not heavy, even though it's as black as coffee. It has a restrained quality; chocolate flavor comes through but doesn't overwhelm. Roastiness barely wafts across the palate and leads to mild bitterness on the finish.

John Harbaugh said at the end of 2010 that one of the reasons the Ravens didn't blitz as much under Mattison is because he just didn't feel comfortable leaving the Ravens corners alone in single coverage. That's understandable, but sometimes it makes sense to take risks, even if you get burned, because of the physical and mental wear and tear it puts on a quarterback. At one point in the fourth quarter, Sanchez actually tried to duck as he was throwing the football he was so weary of getting hit. That's how in his head the rush was.

As Yao’s shot went up with 0.8 seconds remaining, Roy slapped his hand in what he would later deem a “bonehead” foul. The shot dropped. So did the free throw.

A: Sleep is critical to me ... at least eight or nine hours a night. I start to slow down my body and my mind at least 30 minutes before I get into bed.

Seidman says he recommended Tinnitus Relief Formula to his patients long before he had any connection with the company. By his estimation, about four or five patients out of 100 who try the product say that their ringing disappears completely. More than half want to keep taking the formula even though they aren't sure how well it's working, if at all. He advises a four-month trial of the tinnitus combo pack.

This puts the emphasis in the wrong place. The main goal should be to create more wealth. We're better off if entrepreneurial risk is richly rewarded. Every private-sector job depended at one time or another on someone willing to take a risk and bring out a new product or service. Our economy cannot reach its potential if entrepreneurial animal spirits are treated in the tax code the same as collecting a paycheck.

France, Italy and Spain inspire the small regular menu.

Umenyiora wasn’t sure if he would be traded during this week’s NFL Draft, though last night seemed like the most logical point at which such a deal would occur because a second- or third-round pick is the expected asking price.

"When they asked me to come out there, I was very, very excited, because I've never been and I want to see," says Valastro. "For me, it's more about just being in the city where all of that history was made from our car industry.

Numerous studies have shown that repeated deployment is a "risk factor" for the disorder. A study published this month examined the experience of 66,000 Marines who served in Iraq. Those with two deployments had almost twice the rate of PTSD as those deployed once. People with longer time at home between deployments had half the risk of developing the disorder as those with rapid turnaround times. There's also considerable evidence that untreated PTSD tends to get worse, not better, over time.

"He was really part of the fabric of modern American pop.

And the current bills are being championed by Republicans like Jones in the Senate and Erik Fresen of Miami in the House.

The Steelers have the league's top-ranked defense, and they're also No. 1 vs. the run. But the Pittsburgh secondary is vulnerable – the Steelers were only 12th vs. the pass.

The easiest is the closed road that links these lookouts. A two-lane strip of asphalt, currently closed to traffic, connects the park's premier viewpoints of the Kalalau Valley, and in early morning and late afternoon, as the fog is wafting overhead, it is a delightful birding walk.

The regents held a public hearing on the merger question in Baltimore Friday and have scheduled another in College Park on Oct. 28; they will issue a report in December. Two things need to come out of that process. First, come what may, the two campuses need to find a way to work more closely together. Critics of the proposal say there's no reason that can't happen without a merger, but it hasn't yet, not in the decade since Mr. Kirwan first raised the issue in his farewell address before leaving Maryland for a time to lead Ohio State University. Having one person in charge of both campuses would seem like the simplest way to achieve the goal, but if the regents decide that's ill advised or unnecessary, the onus is on them to come up with an alternative for producing greater integration for research and teaching.

It's a big game for both teams. Currently the Ducks sit tied atop the Pac-12 conference for first place, and another win would only boost their confidence before they hit the road for their first-ever league games at Colorado and Utah. As far as I can tell, the Ducks are definitely a contender for the league title. The Pac-12 doesn't have a superior team this season, and Oregon is just scratching the surface of what they can do. When they find the energy and focus to full court press, they're a different team.

He hired a clown as a coach and allowed fans to vote live from the stands on what to do on plays on the field. He brought back White Sox great Minnie Minoso in 1980 when Minoso was in his 50s so the player could claim he played in five decades.

One could argue that, at 26, James is old enough to know better than to flame on former fans. On the other hand, a congressman twice his age was just caught tweeting crotch shots of himself from the House gym. Some guys take way too long to grow up, and if James had been any fuller of himself this season, his head would have rocketed into space. Unlike that congressman, though, LeBron James has harmed only himself, no matter how many Cavs fans claim injury.

They failed to score in the first half after an interception by Josh Gordy and a blocked punt by Robert Quinn. And, again, the offense lacked explosive plays. The Rams' best chance came early in the second quarter, when Brandon Lloyd had beaten two Bengals on a deep route but Clemens' pass fell just short.

In the end, every country got half of what it wanted. Yet it is clear all three leaders will need to compromise if the euro zone is to escape its death spiral. Ms. Merkel will eventually have to recognize that fiscal transfers and the underwriting of government debt markets is essential to restore the confidence of markets; Mr. Sarkozy must accept that further transfers of sovereignty to supra-national authorities are essential to address the moral hazard implicit in a full fiscal union; and Mr. Cameron must acknowledge that only a fiscal and political union built around the existing EU institutions can create conditions for a lasting solution to the euro crisis in the timescale needed.

Brooke White: She had a childhood fantasy about performing "Let it Be" on piano, and now it's come true. Her version is heartfelt, quiet,appealingly unfussy, if not the most original thing you've ever heard.. Randy's a fan. Paula again says, "America can feel your heart." And, again, eww. Simon thinks it was one of the best performances of the night and Brooke is teary, resting her head on Ryan's shoulder. Aww.
Practice is clearly the essence of life for Bittová, who lives in a house in the woods with the younger of her two sons, with no TV and no radio. ("Mostly I prefer to listen to silence," she said.) She will often practice a year or more before she takes a new work before an audience. "The reaction of people is that it looks so natural and so easy," she said with a laugh. "But it's very hard to sing and play at the same time. It's kind of schizophrenic if you are just concentrating on your singing and then on your playing, but it's really only a matter of how much time I spend with practicing. I started when I was 22, and now I am next year 50, so it's long time, but still I am surprising myself with what I can find new in sound -- the new possibilities of this kind of combination. It makes me happy, and sometimes I believe I can make happy the audience."

Increasing domestic oil drilling will not solve our energy problems, as Mr. Morici implies. It is also counterproductive to pit one energy source against another — nuclear is better than wind, biofuels are better than solar, etc. To describe alternative energy technologies as "fanciful" is short-sighted. Oil will only be reasonably affordable for another 40 years at most, and if we don't continue to develop alternatives, by 2050 oil dependence itself will be considered "fanciful."

I thought about that this past week while watching the NFL draft, the polar opposite of imagination. I don't know how many people ESPN and the NFL Network employ to cover the draft, but I am guessing it's in the millions. At least it felt that way. Every prospect had a camera on him, every top draftee was grabbed for a fast reaction. We saw mothers, girlfriends, agents, even the NFL commissioner hugging the players, team caps being tugged on, jerseys held up. There was file footage, instant analysis, numbers, charts, graphics. Your brain needed overdrive to process all the data.
The first piece I ever wrote was about the Duke of Windsor. It was 1973 and he had just died and I was looking for something to write about. I had read everything that the Duke himself had written and read all these articles that came out when he died. My feeling was that they didn't really capture the man the way I would have captured him. He was probably the most photographed man in the first half of the twentieth century, so I said I'd write an article about him and try to understand him in terms of his style.

When the new fall TV season debuted, many prognosticators were betting the first casualty might be another NBC show, "Free Agents," the comedy co-starring Hank Azaria and Kathryn Hahn, executive produced by Oregon native John Enbom. I seem to be in the critical minority in finding "Free Agents' promising -- it's not clicking on all cylinders yet, but I think Azaria and Hahn have an easy, unforced chemistry, and I'm willing to give the show some time.

We've got to do a better job of making that happen. But that's part of his job. He's going to take some shots. As a quarterback, I don't think there's anything more satisfying that getting hit and making a play at the same time. He's got a great attitude and a great resolve."
