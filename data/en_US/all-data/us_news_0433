"The Aviator" carries the rosebud idea almost to the point of parody, with its opening image of Howard Hughes' mother washing the boy with excessively loving attention. This behavior, the movie suggests, is the reason for Hughes' brilliance and for the obsessive-compulsive disorder that was his undoing, and although this device may work in theory, it didn't begin to explain the motivations and innermost feelings of an actual person. It seemed more like the clever idea of an avid student of film.

Brady: That's an equity issue. And all of our children should have arts programming, the ability to go on field trips, cultural events and experiences.

This may be the least understood irony of the Prop. 13 system. By separating the responsibility for taxing and spending at the local level and by centralizing power in the state Capitol, Prop. 13 opened the way for public employees  teachers, police, firefighters, prison guards, city managers  to increase their influence, both in local government and in Sacramento. They have used that power to raise their compensation to levels unequaled in the rest of the country.

Move the shipping channel south, toward Oregon, and condemn the railroad bridge downstream. We need to build the new bridge at the height of the lifts allowed by the old bridge; however, this would bring the bridge into downtown Vancouver unacceptably high. This can be mitigated by moving the shipping channel toward Hayden Island and realigning the channel through a new railroad bridge downstream. This also has the benefit of moving the new bridge away from the flight path for Pearson Field, opening up new and more inspiring design options. The rail bridge is very vulnerable to earthquakes. The railroads show no sign of accepting responsibility for this shameless threat to public safety and welfare, so we'll have to do their work for them. We simply can't wait. We can use the newer of the two existing I-5 spans to replace the rail bridge, and lease it back to the railroads.

6) France refused to recognize Haiti as an independent country until 1825, in exchange for a payment of 90 million francs. That payment was for "lost property", by the way, property which included the former slaves themselves. So why did Haiti pay? To end a crippling embargo against Haiti by England, France and the United States. The U.S. certainly had a vested interest in punishing Haiti for it's independence, lest its own slaves get ideas. In fact, the United States did not recognize Haiti as an independent republic until 1862. As I said, Haiti did make the payment to France, but it was forced to take out high-interest loans in order to do so. It took Haiti another 122 years to pay off those debts.

Discover didn't change its rewards amounts (yet), but by forcing you to have at least $50 before redeeming, that's money in Discover's pocket for an extra month or two. Multiply that by however many millions of customers get cash rewards from Discover (as opposed to gift cards), and that's a lot of revenue created by simply delaying the cash back payments. (If you don't have the cash posted to your account, that's that much more you have to pay on your bill or else be assessed finance charges.)

Richards could have been fined up to $5,000, but because he paid the cost of the January hunting expedition not long after the time limit expired, he was given a written warning instead.

And the second is not justifiable when the United States and other foreign countries have proved their mettle with a 10-year effort in this conflict, as well as a promise to take three more years to leave Afghanistan gradually and responsibly.

Start with the growing sinkhole of a punchless attack that scored fewer than four runs for the eighth time in nine games. That pretty much spells misery in the American League. Two late runs didn't change that.
Bad marksmanship on your part? Not really. The problem stems from a lack of new ideas in shooters outside of venue changes, clothing changes from one kit of ragged togs to another -- there must have been another firefight between sequels that nobody mentioned to get the clothes looking that way -- a change of faces riding shotgun ...

Domestic servitude is a common problem around the world, even in the United States. Police prosecute a dozen or more of these malefactors each year. But these cases are episodic, even unusual.

Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University who has written a book on U.S. bishops. "Priests are one of the most important constituencies that a bishop has. He needs them to do almost anything in the diocese."

Wallace, whose excellent book on food and drink pairings Corked & Forked (Running Press) was published this fall, had some offbeat suggestions, such as a breakfast of prosecco with pancakes ("one I do almost every Christmas") and Korean soft tofu with cava. "The best pairing, hands down, is an Oregon sparkling wine and potato chips," Wallace said. "You may laugh, but go and try it. It will blow your mind. The saltiness of the chips and the zing and pop of the bubbly is delicious."

Once inside, you'd never dream that the Westin South Coast Plaza is next door and that glass office towers are just down the street, and the 405 freeway only blocks away. We're out here on the terrace sipping Champagne or pretty pink kir. I hear a murmur of French from the bar.

It's not that we're living in a pansexual utopia - it's hard to imagine mainstream stars doing anything to wreck their images - but more and more young musicians are refusing to be closeted.
Remember the '50s? Well, probably you don't, but you've seen it on TV: very few moms worked; they were at home baking cookies and playing with the kids. Except the truth of the matter is, we didn't play with the kids all that much. The kids entertained themselves for the most part. We mothers were busy baking cookies but also mending and ironing and cleaning, and if the kids told us they were bored we either made them help us hang out the wet laundry or told them to go play and not come back until the street lights came on. Many of us got tired of housework, and wished we had jobs so we'd have our own bank accounts.
There has been animosity building between the sides in recent years on key issues. Now it will be open for the whole world to see.
There were photos and loving Facebook posts between them — none of which I'd ever seen, because I hadn't known to look on her page, where all evidence but the birthday note was stored.
After intermission, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho's "Orion" -- commissioned by the orchestra more than a decade ago and premiered in 2003 -- proved to be less of a showcase. Titled for the mythic Greek hunter of the night skies (and the constellation), the 20-minute work was slow to gain interest.

Air travelers from the United States may be souring on Europe, but those arriving by sea are just gearing up for the Continent. "Europe is so hot this year," says Paul Motter, editor of CruiseMates, an online cruising guide (www.cruisemates.com). "The farther the dollar drops, the more popular [seeing Europe by cruise] becomes." Specifically, the most scorching itineraries are in the Mediterranean and Baltic.
What makes this especially galling is that the people of Maryland had long ago taken every possible step to ensure that public officials suspected of accepting bribes could be criminally prosecuted in state court. In 1867, we adopted a specific provision in the Maryland Constitution to forestall the very result the Court of Appeals reached.
Even if Romney is partially right about the past -- heck, even UAW President Bob King concedes his union made mistakes -- why go out of your way to alienate a big voting bloc just to score a point or two with the presumably anti-union crowd that votes in GOP primaries?

Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo, in his most recent book "The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good Men Turn Evil," offers clues that help explain what is happening in Iraq. Inhumane acts require dehumanizing the "enemy." The "routinization" of the repeated attacks help the perpetrators carry out the next one - and the next. It helps if a command structure exists in which the individuals who carry out the acts don't have to take responsibility for what they have been ordered to do.
As promised, one lucky reader walks away from this bandstand with two tickets to the May 25 performance of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and dinner for two at Llywelyn's Pub. And that lucky reader is:
Latos wasn't around for the one runner he left behind, Garcia, to score. The righty, who came to Busch Stadium with a 25.31 ERA, leaves it with a slightly better ERA. He allowed eight runs (all of them earned) on nine hits and three walks. He cut his Busch III ERA to 18.81.
It was Rezireksyon Kris who told the women not to hit the children, Christina and Solomon said. When the robed figure was at the apartment, they were not struck, nor were they tied to the radiator, they said.
While I usually came down the slow way, I did on occasion come down faster than I wished. One day I encountered a nest teeming with ferocious wasps. Thinking that I could stop myself farther down with my safety rope, I just stepped off the tree, freeing my gaffs. Two seconds later, I found myself on the ground, with my thick hemp safety rope broken. The tree was too slick to even slow my fall, and the rope broke as I passed by a heavy branch, just about 10 feet above the ground.
The last time a powerful storm destroyed Atlantic City’s famed boardwalk was the 1944 hurricane that also wiped out the boardwalks in Cape May, Ventnor and Margate. Ventnor and Margate never rebuilt theirs.

Bray also said the group's fundraising tactics had changed, to try to get donors to contribute for specific causes -- such as helping the May Day rallies take place -- rather than looking for blanket donations to cover all of the movement's needs. Those needs have diminished considerably since Nov. 15, when police dismantled the camp that was feeding thousands and housing hundreds of people daily.
To date, Lake Oswego has spent $2.2 million in planning for a Portland streetcar line extension, including a $1.5 million loan to TriMet to lead efforts for a draft environmental impact statement. However, the city is due to receive a $1.8 million reimbursement from TriMet by this September.
The consumers' counsel's budget this year is $8.5 million in nontax money from assessments on utilities, based on each company's Ohio gross earnings or receipts. Kasich wants to slash that 51 percent, to $4.14 million. His chainsaw might spare FirstEnergy, American Electric Power, Dayton Power and Light and the gas companies headaches, but it wouldn't save taxpayers money. And it would cost consumers.
Hitchcock has grown tired of the question, and but soon he'll have to reveal his decision. The Blues' first-round series against the Sharks starts Thursday at Scottrade Center.

McQueary, who grew up in State College, played at Penn State, and was a team captain and starting quarterback as a senior, didn't step in to stop Sandusky from abusing the child.

What I understood, you wanted emails, which I happen to think are phone conversations on paper, electronic, that's really what email is. I thought you were interested, or at least that was the point and the spirit of the conversation, how I govern, how I manage and how I make a decision. Now if that's the case, I have a lot I want to talk about. That's transparency, that's nine months worth of work. In only nine months taking on 40 years of history, and I'm not done. I've got another 3 ½ years. You'll make a judgment along the way at the end did we move the ball forward in making city government more transparent. I think that record, that is voluminous, speaks about the nine months worth of work.
Mitchell would examine whether the timing is right for Tempe to spend millions of dollars to build a modern streetcar in the downtown. He is concerned about adding a costly public project while the city is cutting bus routes and has yet to provide Orbit services in south Tempe.

Standing in the middle of one of the 10 operating rooms during a recent tour, Benedict, dressed in a sterile gown, pointed to video equipment. "This will allow doctors outside of this building to have visual access if a consultation is needed during surgery."
Sae-A's revenues are more than double Haiti's garment industry's $512 million exports for 2009. In addition to Haitian managers, the company has committed to pay line workers at least four times Haiti's average $640 GDP per capita. The facility itself will boast a cooling system, recreational facilities and a football field. With the construction bid package currently being prepared to go out this month, the first phase has already been laid out. Sae-A's operations will occupy 126 of 185 acres, said Mark D'Sa, a Miami-based executive with Gap who has been on loan with the State Department to help Haiti better take advantage of trade legislation.

Hot dogs? We’re the A-1 super best. Coney Island, Yankee Stadium, Sixth Avenue pushcarts, Stage Deli. Ever try one at Fenway in Boston? The skinny thing’s beige. Ever down a beige hot dog?

Gavin asked the council to declare four provisions of the law to be an unfunded mandate. The provisions required school districts to:
East Ninth Street was dressed up to resemble New York's 42nd Street, with the Big Apple's skyline digitally inserted in postproduction. It's Cleveland, and it features a big battle, but the quick-cut editing doesn't allow for many spot-your-city moments. Cleveland's most recognizable close-up occurs when Loki forces a large crowd to bow before him. The Renaissance Cleveland Hotel, Terminal Tower, Tower City Center and 200 Public Square (the former BP Building) are clearly visible. NASA's test facility also receives several minutes of screen time, looking suitably scientific and secretive.
