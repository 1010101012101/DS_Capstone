Tax breaks for angel investors have cropped up in recent years in about two dozen states as a means of stimulating job growth. But the effectiveness of the incentives—which range from breaks on 15% of funding in Colorado to 100% in Hawaii—are coming under greater scrutiny, particularly as states face budget pressure. Many states' programs expired at the end of 2011, were stripped of funding or were placed under a moratorium.
Five-on-five, the Sharks were not terribly out-played tonight. And after the Blues cruised to a 4-1 lead in the final period, the Sharks rallied with two late-game goals to spark the crowd a bit.
GETTING THERE: Fly to Bangkok or Singapore, then take a budget carrier – Air Asia, Silk Air, Dragon Air, Jet Star, to name a few – to Phnom Penh. Bus service between Phnom Penh and Kep is cheap (around $7;ppsoryatransport.com), but getting tickets and finding the right departure point can be difficult. Renting a taxi to make the three-hour drive is also possible. Cost varies depending on whether you use a private car (lyna-carrental.com) or a shared taxi or car.

Castillo de la Gala had hoped that he and his fiancee, Kathryn Tran, would marry at the hotel next year, but now they must make other plans. Two years ago, Tran was in the audience and requested several classical pieces: Rachmaninoff, Pachelbel, Puccini's "O Mio Babbino Caro." On the way out, she asked for his business card.

"I had just laid down to sleep when I felt a wave-like rumble beneath me, as if our house was a dinner plate and someone quickly pulled the tablecloth out from under it followed by a loud BOOM!

How about “Piranha 3DD”? Is “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” (June 29) actual retaliation for the incinerating reviews greeting the 2009 release of “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra?” Are you ready for “Magic Mike” (June 29), a Steven Soderbergh film based on Channing Tatum’s adventures as a male stripper?

It's hard to believe, but the baseball-related attention of a national TV network Saturday will be focused on St. Louis and not a contest involving a team from the American League East.

Afterward, we climbed broad stairs (ghats) up the riverbank or climbed the warren of narrow pathways and corridors to the streets, smelling the incense and watching the holy men. Near Rasathai village, on a particularly strenuous hike up a steep cliff to some beautiful temple ruins, I entered a small shrine and was blessed by a Hindu priest who tied yarn, which he blessed, around my wrist to protect me. I wore it for many weeks until it wore through.
But how do you not root for the runt of the litter going Mighty Mouse on everyone to win the day?
This means that getting to the top can be a fast ride. As Forbes showed in a 2011 analysis, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford each took more than two decades to hit $1 billion in net worth. Website founders like Bezos and Zuckerberg can do it in a matter of a few years. Priceline's Jay Walker needed just one year.
Watson did apologize personally to Denny some years ago, the only one of his attackers to do so. Another time he offered to send a limo to pick him up and take him to Florence and Normandie, then somewhere afterward where the two could have a drink and talk.

About that puck. It's 6 ounces of frozen, vulcanized rubber. When coming off a player's stick -- a weapon in itself -- it can reach speeds of more than 100 mph.

In many ways, "Engagement" reflects both the best and worst of Stoller and Segel's creative collaborations. They have a history that goes back to at least TV's 2001 series "Undeclared," one of Judd Apatow's excellent underachievers, which Stoller wrote for and Segel acted in. Their breakout film, 2008's"Forgetting Sarah Marshall" (Stoller directed, Segel wrote and starred), introduced the kind of sweetness amid the raunchy riffs that have come to characterize their work.

He tallied a double-double at Chicago (13 rebounds and 12 points), followed by 21 points against the Magic. And he played splendid basketball against the Nuggets last week, scoring 11 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in just 19 minutes. He hit a big 3-pointer, launching the shot near Denver coach George Karl.

The hotel tax rate hike, Ulman said last year, does not go against his statement that he had "zero intention of raising taxes" because he was referring to "general taxes charged to Howard County citizens and property owners."

One thing's for sure: What they say about the Marina Safeway is real.

My child is a high school student in the St. Charles School District. I cannot believe how many days these kids are getting off. It's very rare that they even go a whole week to school. It's either half days for teacher meetings or their conferences. I understand that, but it's ridiculous. And then we wonder why St. Charles and Missouri is lacking in education? Nothing gets accomplished on those half days, at any level from grade K-12. The St. Charles School District needs to get on the ball. They should not have any half days. Teachers, you don't need a half day every single month for your discussions.

2007, United States, 84 minutes. Even if you think you don't like the kind of music Pansy Division has been creating for 16 years, director Michael Carmona's film about the great queercore band will win you over - if not by the music itself, then by the intelligence and personality of the band members and by Carmona's talent for telling a compelling story. It's fascinating to see - and hear - the band's music evolve and, as it does, to understand Pansy Division's powerful role in contemporary gay culture. That includes front man Jon Ginoli's observation that many gay people don't like Pansy Division's music. Maybe this one should be called "Shine a Queer Light." Carmona may not have had Martin Scorsese's budget, but he's created a brilliant music documentary.

Hey, James: I've seen lots of young infielders struggle in their first couple of years in the big leagues. Julio Franco and Brook Jacoby come to mind. The reason they stayed in the lineup was because they could hit. We have yet to see if Chisenhall and LaPorta can be productive hitters. If they do, the Indians will find a place for them to play.
Fifth Third, for example, did a major overhaul this year to its 9-year-old bill payment service. The goal was to fulfill what customers were asking for, said Larry McClanahan, director of digital delivery.

ACCOMMODATIONS. If you're considering a big festival in a small community, you can expect local hotels and B&Bs to hike their rates for the festival season.

Syesha Mercado: Her song choice: "Vanishing." Another song I never heard. Syesha gives it some of those Mariah runs (you know, the kind Mariah likes to illustrate by pointing her fingers as she sings). Randy credits her for always picking the toughest song and thinks she "did a good job on it, all things considered." Geez, faint praise much? Paula thought it was smart to choose a song not many people know and something about her being "Unbelievably magical." Simon says it was "very very good," though in picking a lesser known song, "you run a risk."

Nader is fine with all that, but he doesn't want to leave Iran because he must care for his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimer's, and won't abandon him. Neither he nor Simin really wants a divorce; Simin just sees it as the only way to give Termeh a better life. But the judge denies the divorce, so the couple agree to separate. Simin will live with her mother, while Termeh will stay with Nader and his father. Perhaps, Termeh reasons, her mother will return eventually.

The bad news: You probably aren't among the 5,000 worldwide members of the Academy for Magical Arts. The good news: You can still get into its clubhouse, the Magic Castle (7001 Franklin Ave.). It's a 1908 Victorian mansion a few blocks north of Hollywood Boulevard. Since 1963, the castle has served dinners and brunches to members and guests, who enjoy the magicians who work the castle's intimate rooms — usually nine performers a night in three rooms — flashing cards, reading minds, creating illusions. Though a fire in October closed the club briefly, the adjoining annex soon reopened Wednesdays through Sundays, and management is hoping for a full reopening in January or February. If you don't know a member, you can buy a 30-day membership ($100). Or — attention, please — you can book a room at the neighboring Magic Castle Hotel (7025 Franklin Ave.). In fact, this low-profile, 30-room hotel (a converted apartment building with a central pool) would be a great value even without access to the castle — low rates, pleasant grounds, sky-high TripAdvisor scores. Check in, take a swim, don the tie and jacket or little black dress (the castle has a formal dress code) and catch the hotel's free shuttle to the clubhouse. There you'll step into a world where secret doorways lead to shadowy bars, where Cary Grant and Johnny Carson once were insiders and Neil Patrick Harris sits on the board of directors. When the last trick is done, catch that shuttle again and close out the night with a $12 martini at neighboring Yamashiro (1999 N. Sycamore Ave.), a restaurant and bar that features a 600-year-old Japanese pagoda and wide, twinkling views of the inexhaustible city.
For another, come what may, Republicans can write their own 2012 insurance policies -- then, conveniently, approve their own claims.

It would border on criminal to charge higher interest in the current economic environment, when the federal government is borrowing at rates well below 3.4%. The average mortgage rate isn't a whole lot higher; Bankrate.com pegs a 30-year mortgage at 4.09% this week. Given that dying is about the only way to get out of student loans (they cannot be dropped or renegotiated in bankruptcy), they probably should go out at low rates forever.

Bowien isn't afraid to experiment and use Western techniques to coax more complexity out of the combinations. Ma po tofu ($9.50) is a classic, but he makes a Bolognese-like sauce of Kurobuta pork shoulder before adding tofu and spices.

What makes this anticipated film so absorbing is how the heroes' internal battles are often more pronounced than their external ones. And when these troubled people interact, it's electric. The dialogue absolutely crackles, whether it's Downey's throwaway insults (he nicknames the muscular, long-haired Thor Point Break) or Hiddleston's iambic arrogance (told that humans have no quarrel with him, he responds, an ant has no quarrel with a boot).

We have no beef with the non-profit status of credit unions that are serving the role intended by Congress. However, the more a credit union changes its balance sheet to operate more like a bank, it should convert to a bank charter and assume all of the responsibilities that come with being a bank. That includes complying with greater regulatory scrutiny, giving back to their communities through the Community Reinvestment Act and paying income taxes.
The outcry began in earnest in 2010, when the state decided to withhold an even larger chunk of energy taxes.

Much of what students do in workshops -- at the festival and at schools -- is rooted in theatrical games. "It's not about creating actors," says Gosnell, "it's about (students) understanding the language in the plays. It's a kinesthetic approach to learning.

Before a fired-up Garden crowd that never quit being loud until the final six minutes, the Knicks fought for most of three quarters but fell apart in the fourth as Anthony disintegrated and failed to lead a depleted roster to a big upset... With Anthony’s wire-to-wire dud performance highlighting a sickly offense that shot 31.9 percent, the Knicks set the NBA record with their 13th straight playoff loss. Their last playoff victory came April 29, 2001, when LeBron James was a high school sophomore in Akron."

According to the lawsuit, after Harrison-Lewis reported what she saw to Imagine officials, they retaliated against her by not responding to her monthly email reports, canceling her corporate credit card and disconnecting her business cellphone.
Taylor's audacious claim might come to mind near the end of LACMA's sizable show, where an elegantly patterned carving of a coiled plumed serpent had its volcanic stone head knocked off and its body hollowed out to form a big, shallow bowl.

I got back into the sleep defensive pretty quickly after he was born. I could fall asleep on a moment's notice, anywhere, for I knew the 20 minutes I got passed out on the couch might be the difference between me making it through the night with my sanity intact and having a psychotic episode at 3 in the morning. And getting enough sleep wasn't the only thing I had to watch out for; how I fell asleep was almost important as the sleep itself. My body, afraid shifting in bed might wake me, would do a great impression of the dead the moment I passed out. I knew falling asleep with my arms underneath me or my neck at a weird angle would mean I could wake up with two arms or a neck that would not move. It's hard to pick up a crying child with hunks of meat that used to be your arms hanging from your shoulders.

It’s been a hard lesson to learn. In 2002, a 3-year-old girl died after a short, torturous battle with a malignant tumor. Landolfi, who had only recently finished his residency, went to the funeral. It was the first and last time. After seeing the family’s devastation, he swore he’d never go to another, and he hasn’t. One of the reasons, he says, is that it might affect his ability to treat the 150 new brain tumor patients he sees each year -- and the 15 who pass away annually.

As much as "Cinder" is inspired by the Cinderella fairy tale, it is also influenced by "Star Wars." It's an origin story that takes place in a world where robots and humans coexist. There isn't only intergalactic contact but negotiation. Peace is tenuous. Disease is rampant. It isn't clear exactly when the story takes place, but it's after World War IV — after gasoline has become the domain of the elite and any working internal combustion vehicles have been sequestered to museums.

While these findings may seem somewhat miraculous, they are probably not unique to blueberries and pomegranates.

That's the thing about Halloween — it's such a playful holiday. Being different is applauded on Halloween, and outrageous behavior is acceptable. It's a holiday of broken rules. On most nights, kids are discouraged from eating sweets and told to keep their distance from strangers, but on Halloween, they're encouraged to knock on the doors of people they don't know and ask for goodies. Adults who might otherwise never talk to one another have a reason to be sociable, generous and friendly. On this one night of the year, neighborliness trumps discord, and fun and frolic win out over reserve.
For more “proof,” the writer points to Hurricane Irene and the damage it caused. Massive hurricanes dating back hundreds of years have affected New Jersey. Was the category 4 Cape May Hurricane of 1821, which tore through with 200 mph wind gusts, caused by man’s internal combustion engine (which wouldn’t be invented for another 60 years)?

Mike Richards and Jeff Carter had a goal apiece and Dustin Penner and Dustin Brown each had a pair of assists in a period that was one goal shy of the franchise playoff record of five in 1993 against Vancouver.
Three cheers for President Obama, whose State of the Union address targeted some of the culprits of economic woe for millions of Americans: fraudulent lenders and corporate offshorers of jobs ("Obama asks fair shot for all," Wednesday). The president vowed relief in the form of prosecution and tax-code reform, to hold accountable those who have profited from lax law enforcement and tax loopholes. He even braved the rough waters of Pentagon spending cuts, by offering to use war savings to plug the deficit and mend our infrastructure, an offer guaranteed to bring crocodile tears from a Defense Department that is used to ever-growing budgets. With the considerable amount of money allocated to the military, there is an answer to the question, "Where will the money come from to accomplish Obama's goals?" It has to come from shrinking the Pentagon. Is the president brave enough to target that culprit?
The counterrevolutionaries discovered early on that the American political system offers many ways around public opinion — delay and obstruction can hold back or nibble away at policies the majority desires.

I knew I was in trouble when I opened the eyes after no more than three hours of "sleep'' and could not shut down again. It was not unlike several thousand mornings I've had since being diagnosed with insomnia in the fall of 2002. Every night is a crapshoot: I have no idea how much sleep I'm going to get. It could be three, four or, if I'm lucky, five -- and that's with a very powerful prescription pill.
As it happens, Maryland enacted a law several years ago (over then-Governor Ehrlich's veto) that made it a crime to willfully and knowingly suppress voter turnout by means of fraud. State Prosecutor Emmet C. Davitt used that law to successfully prosecute Mr. Schurick and is now seeking to use it against Mr. Henson. No conspiracy to punish Mr. Henson is required; the law is the law, and Mr. Davitt, as he pointed out in court, does not report to any of those Mr. Henson sees as pulling the strings.

"Today's agreement assures us that the work can be done quickly and at a reasonable cost," said Ken Silliman, chief of staff to Mayor Frank Jackson in a press release. "The agreement also preserves the city's position on local participation that contractors are a reflection of our community."
A certain amount of bile distinguishes “God of Carnage,” and also a certain amount of fun. Also, a certain amount of truth. Reza’s curdled view of the way of the world might be a fun-house mirror, but it’s undeniably a mirror. Barry Johnson, in his review of this production for Oregon Arts Watch, argues that Veronica’s appeals to the prescriptive moral and philosophical standards of Western civilization are vastly more French than American, and I suspect he’s right. Still, part of what Reza seems to be telling us is that philosophy is a crock: Like art and do-gooder activism, it’s all just a fancy coverup for the underlying chaos and brutality that really rules the universe. Down that path lie cynicism, opportunism and nihilism. Unfortunately, the path is well-traveled and well-paved.
But make no mistake, this is work. In early 2010, the pair started seriously developing recipes (they use only cocoa and sugar -- no cocoa butter, vanilla or other additives common in mass-produced chocolate). They knew early on that they were going to need space to grow. "At some point," Ring says, "we put together a list of our friends who had garages."
On Thursday, it agreed to sell its 98 percent stake in Taiwan's third-largest insurance company. Before that, it took Asia's AIA Group life insurance company public, raising $20 billion. It raised $16 billion by selling American Life Insurance Co. to MetLife.
Sounds like Howard County ladies were kept well abreast of the latest fashion trends, with even a primer on the correct collars for their afternoon gowns. A well turned-out lady of 1912 might have frowned on today's ultra casual "afternoon," after work apparel: "Hmm, let's see, sweats or jeans?" It might also be, however, a disapproval tinged with envy.
Former Rutgers standout quarterback Mike Teel was named the quarterbacks coach at Wagner College, according to the school.

They then fell into a deeper hole, going down by 19 points in the fourth quarter. That turned out to be insurmountable.
The Cavs have not had more than one day off in four weeks. Which means they haven't been able to have a true hard practice, which is where you smooth your rough spots. Yet they are getting through it well, now with nine wins in the last 10 games. They are now 9-3 this season against teams with current winning records. The team is saying they are 14-3 against teams with winning records on the day of the game but that is a circumstanial stat.

The transfer from Georgia Tech should lead the Pirates in scoring from Day 1. But more so, he needs to become a vocal leader inside the locker room without the presence of any seniors next season. Fuquan Edwin isn't quite there yet and none of the other players have the cache that Oliver will bring. He needs to step to the forefront.
This example of the malignant malice of some liberals against the president who became 20th-century liberalism's most consequential adherent is described in Robert Caro's "The Passage of Power," the fourth and, he insists, penultimate volume in his "The Years of Lyndon Johnson," which when completed will rank as America's most ambitiously conceived, assiduously researched and compulsively readable political biography. The new volume arrives 30 years after the first, and its timing is serendipitous: Are you seeking an antidote to current lamentations about the decline of political civility? Immerse yourself in Caro's cringe-inducing catalog of humiliations, gross and petty, inflicted on Johnson by many New Frontiersmen, and with obsessive hatred by Robert Kennedy.
The Pacers have adjusted well, keeping an eye on him as they are able to home in for consecutive games.

Kids can be let down if they didn't get the present they wanted or Christmas at their house didn't measure up to the depiction of the holiday in their favorite television show. Even worse, a lot of toys don't offer lasting fun, Davis said.
The hierarchy of the Catholic Church opposes contraception as a tenet of faith, and that is its right. Nothing in the HHS regulations requires anyone to purchase or use a condom, ingest a single birth control pill, or submit to a vasectomy under any circumstances.

The hiring of Meyer, a two-time national championship coach at age 47, would be among the most significant hires in recent college football history. It's not often coaches with his resume come back on the market, at least not without an unsuccessful stop in the NFL to take some shine off their accomplishments. In the past 40 years, nine coaches have won national titles at one school and later coached at another. Only fifth-year Alabama coach Nick Saban, who won a title with LSU before going to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, would match Meyer's star quality in the modern era. Saban won another title in his third season with the Crimson Tide.

Swanson's report suggests that Accretive was developing risk scores to predict high-cost patients. Other providers may also rely on data-crunching contractors to become ACOs.
Last March, on the last day of spring break, Sharon Dunski Vermont confronted an ugly truth: Her daughters were close to becoming spoiled brats. They had spent the day out with friends, and decided to get ice cream. Sharon told them in the car that they would be getting child-sized scoops. Her older daughter responded: That's not fair. In the store, she got more irate and more upset and had a meltdown.

Now, I do recall that Ichiro scared me once before — in 2006, when he was batting .177 on April 18 before finishing at .322 with a league-leading 224 hits. But that was April, and this is June, and it’s possible that Ichiro is in the deep autumn of his baseball life.

Keeping it real: No trip to O'ahu is complete without spending some time on the rural North Shore, although when winter's big-surf contests such as the Triple Crown of Surfing are on, visitors may find the traffic more daunting than the waves. You can also get a closer look at Little's aquatic world at galleries and stores selling his books and prints around the island, including Global Creations in Hale'iwa, Mu'umu'u Heaven in Kailua and Greenroom Gallery in Waikiki. North Shore swells can also be seen in Southern California, thanks to the newly opened Clark Little Gallery in Laguna Beach.
øThe shares have soared to $75, or $7,500, so you have a gain of $2,500. If you sell the shares, you'll owe long-term capital gains taxes on your gain. Long-term gains are taxed at 15%, so you'd owe Uncle Sam $375. Short-term gains - those on assets held less than a year - are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

customer Flor de Caña Nicaraguan rum and diet cola after explaining that Sanctuaria didn't stock the guy's go-to brand, Bacardi. "About five minutes later he came back and asked for a sample of just the rum," Seiter says. "His eyes lit up." The customer handed Seiter a credit card and asked to buy a case.

LONG BRANCH — Authorities are trying to determine if four second-grade boys, who were allegedly tied up inside a bathroom at Gregory Elementary School in Long Branch by two maintenance employees last week, were the subject of a prank in poor taste or something more malicious.
The safety board, which has only advisory power, urged that the "grandfathering" exemption be dropped and that all older lines be tested. The draft report by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration - which could actually order a repeal - defends the exemption, saying pipeline operators that maintain the old, untested lines "can produce safety comparable to or better than newer pipelines."
Justin Walder, DePascale’s attorney, said the Supreme Court has the discretion to hear a matter on an expedited basis. In her order, Long said DePascale can ask the Supreme Court again to take up the case after Feinberg finishes with it.

Among other things, Gualtieri said, statistical reports of low performance should have been a warning flag. For example, in one five-week period, Harmer wrote 11 reports, issued six traffic tickets and six warnings, and stopped two citizens for questioning — while idling a total of 58 hours.
He was a second-grader in outer Southeast Portland when his family moved into the ranch house with the big backyard. They'd spent all year refurbishing it.

She added that out-of-staters and foreign students add cultural diversity and different perspectives to campuses.
Are smoking charges a scam? They can be. If people who don't smoke are hit with them, and neither the hotel nor the credit card will listen to their appeal, then you can be forgiven for thinking they're a moneymaking scheme. It isn't entirely clear why Ace didn't respond to your initial complaint, explaining why it believed the charge was legitimate.
The sweeps did result in some felony arrests of legal residents on charges including assault on a police officer, aggravated assault, trafficking in stolen goods and aggravated driving under the influence.

When Laurel and Hank go to town, they encounter an overzealous recruiting officer, Chauncey Feith. He's thrilled to talk big about fighting the Germans and demanding everyone do their part for the war, but most of the townspeople also note, pointedly, that he remains safely at home. Chauncey is a lot like a comedian's heckler, or a football fan blasting a player. A big mouth in a coward's body.
Put it this way: At Springboro High, which is just across the street, their mom (Debby) and sister (Becky) were in the school’s athletic Hall of Fame long before Jake ever made it, and their grandfather (Gil Burson) was enshrined decades earlier for being one of the top basketball scorers in the school’s history.

The rain spared some performances but put a damper on others. Gayle Skidmore, 29, of Spring Valley finished her indie folk pop performance on G Street seconds before the first drops started to fall.

"We composed a lot of our own material," lead singer John Sebastian told The Plain Dealer shortly before the 2000 inducitons.

In the course of 22 seasons, Blake produced 154 musicals, 14 of them world premieres. He had an especially big hand in those shows, mostly revues or old movies that he turned into stage musicals with the addition of Great American Songbook standards.
"Because they had made 10 successful trips here, it became ho-hum," said Jablonski, a Jersey City native with an encyclopedic recall of history.

Armstrong said it isn't just Allen he has to be concerned about. Phoenix Mountain Pointe's Ben Trotter (10.60 in the 100) and Travonn White (10.82) "have come out of nowhere this year," Armstrong said.
Those worst years coincided with the sudden emergence of a young high school football star that shared his name. Martin only started playing football at Taylor-Allderdice High as a senior because his mother wanted him to do something away from their awful neighborhood, and because the coach, Mark Wittgartner, had seen his physical talents in gym class.
Still, this all can change quickly. The Wings have the talent to beat the Predators. They are getting healthier. And Howard, who missed several games late in the season with a groin injury, has the ability to match Predators goalie Pekka Rinne.
"In a situation like Newark where there’s no particular term limit ... there’s always a reluctance to cross the mayor by some of his supporters," said Joseph Marbach, a political scientist and provost of La Salle University. "It was a strategic blunder on the part of the mayor."

The NCAA Outdoor Championships, are June 9-12 at Hayward Field in Eugene. And what about the Prefontaine Classic, on July 3, also at Hayward?
I go back and forth on this, thinking and rethinking myself into what they call in programming a deadly embrace – too many overlapping and conflicting thoughts to reconcile. The Rangers are beasts, and in the ALCS they played some of the best, most dominating games I've watched this season. Their lineup is imposing and their ballpark is a launch pad. But here's the thing: the Cardinals get to hit there, too, and they get to add Allen Craig to a lineup that led the NL during the regular season and bludgeoned the Brewers. Big Mac's Attack has the ability to get ahead early, neutralize the Rangers bullpen and, with just one or two quality starts from the rotation, tilt this series. In short, pity the pitchers.
The group responded and found a small orange tabby and white cat that was soaked with gasoline and mud, covered with abscesses and wounds and had been shot in the face with a pellet.

Reines has taken on a department soiled by the criminal misdeeds of his disgraced predecessor, Frank Russo, who pleaded guilty Thursday to 21 corruption charges. The office also is hobbled by what Plain Dealer reporting has revealed to be the architecture of patronage: a lack of written hiring guidelines, no formal process for setting salaries and noncompetitive purchasing procedures. That is coupled with the deep corrosion caused by numerous political and legal lapses on county boards of revision that hear property-valuation appeals.
With the motor running, add the half-and-half through the food tube, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the work bowl. Process until smooth and creamy.
True, it was one test program and a single license for food carts. But the decisions could have far-reaching implications for a state that loves its boutique adult beverages but also maintains a conspicuous government overlay on their sales and distribution.

The latest installment of the Chicago Tribune and WGN-TV's pension series grew directly from a story we wrote last month.
