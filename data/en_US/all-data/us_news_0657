Orlando is the "other" Cabrera these days, given the surreal hitting of shortstop Asdrubal Cabrera -- another homer, another clutch hit in the eighth inning of Monday's win over the Red Sox. But in 2004, Orlando Cabrera was one of the big reasons the Boston Red Sox broke the most famous hex of them all, the Curse of the Bambino. That itself can be blamed to ownership with shallow pockets, albeit in 1918.

Its sugar mills, born amid a 19th century boom, died about 60 years ago. The paved highway didn't arrive until the mid-1980s, about the time the first American expat artist, Charles Stewart, moved in. With no airport, no marina, no golf and virtually no nightlife, downtown amounts to just a few blocks of newish galleries, inns and shops in oldish buildings.

Shaffer says three years of tweaking and responding to feedback has propelled employee participation in wellness from 60 percent to 74 percent. Now her goal is to build to 80 percent participation. While she's proud of the numbers, it's not really full-scale participation that she feels employers are after.

"It's helped develop a toughness and a work ethic," Wolfe said. "Waking up early has never been a problem because you had to wake up early before school to get things done.

Batum admits that he needs to get in better condition if he will be asked to keep this up and he says he needs to carve time for more rest in between games.

Where the movie is at its best is in the comically laconic, straight-to-the-camera remarks offered by Carthage's residents. (They're played by a mix of local actors and real townspeople doing partially scripted versions of themselves.) Mr. Linklater is no stranger to such techniques. Ever since his 1991 "Slacker," he has enjoyed meandering down twisted paths with characters encountered or invented along the way. But this element of "Bernie" isn't so much a meander as a pungent meditation on the hero and the importance of being nice. It's the lean steak that sells the stylized sizzle.

They're a good measure of forest health, very charismatic and a great symbol for us."

As the book opens, the temperature drops. Gary's cabin construction starts so rashly late in the season that it belies his and Irene's 30 years up north.

2007 Flaio Primitivo, Salento, Italy ($13) - Primitivo has been rumored to be the cousin, or even the direct origin of, California's Zinfandel. Scientific studies have proved these rumors to be myths, although most agree there are similarities. The grape is typically grown in the warmth of southern Italy, which gives it a good boost in alcohol with a healthy amount of spice and dark color. This wine has an almost stewed- and ripe-berry quality to the fruit, with firm (but not too firm) structure in the background and a tasty grip of spice. 86 points

This morning's "Cleveburgh" pieces suggests that a high-speed rail corridor from Cleveland to Akron to Youngstown to Pittsburgh makes much more sense than Cleveland to Columbus to Cincinnati. I can see Carnegie-Mellon students commuting to Case-Western Reserve and the reverse if the trains run fast enough. I can see business people choosing rail as easier than air to make connections between and among these cities. Columbus is my hometown, and I never envisioned high-speed rail as a necessity for central Ohioans...except to get to a Browns game or a Bengals game.

2. Guard Steve Blake: Whenever Kobe Bryant touts the Lakers' good chances in winning a championship, he always rattles off the team's size, versatility and experience. But he always makes sure to add that the Lakers become a dramatically more dangerous team when they shoot well from three-point range. No one on the bench has a bigger responsibility and more of a green light to shoot those shots than Blake. But will he? Any standout performance, such as his 13-point effort last week on three-for-five shooting from three-point range against Oklahoma City, only come in spurts.

"In most cases of abduction or murder, the family members stick together. Even when all of the evidence points to one of them, they still believe in the innocence of the family member," Levin said.

So heres the question  if Lidstrom played baseball, football or basketball at the same level that he plays hockey, who would he be? Hes one of the all-time greats. Hes won four championships. Hes been honored for his play with seven Norris Trophies. The Sporting News named him the player of the decade for the first 10 years of this century. He deserves all the accolades given to Derek Jeter, Tom Brady or Kobe Bryant as one of the greatest players in his sport. So who is? Is he Jeter? No, hes not in New York and he doesnt date super models and Hollywood actresses. Is he Brady? Nope. Brady plays the glamour position and married Gisele Bundchen. Is he Bryant? Lidstrom is far too unselfish for that comparison. Nick would never go for 80 in a regular season game.

Today, a solid majority of Americans support abortion rights, gay civil rights and other socially liberal positions; by a 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 margin, Americans oppose the extreme positions staked out by the right-wing sexual counterrevolutionaries on abortion and gay civil rights. Even on gay marriage, the balance has shifted toward more liberty and acceptance.

interpretations, has been enforced in varied degrees, and has been implemented in different parts of the world at various times in history. Just like any body of law, there is much debate amongst Muslims regarding the application and interpretation of certain areas of Islamic law.

The vast majority of the Sharia that deals with the mundane issues of daily life are never mentioned or discussed.

The staggering amount of corporate sponsorship at the festival certainly didn't help. Big names like Kanye and Lionel Richie were sponsored by even bigger names like Doritos and Pepsi, and that distracted from budding artists who'd been shoved onto much smaller stages with smaller sponsors.

That's why so many people objected to proposals earlier this year to help homeowners who were defaulting on their mortgages in record numbers.

But McCain skewed his analysis of the situation in a clumsy effort to link Obama to the problems. And Obama placed too much faith in regulation to protect taxpayers.

While the unions don't elect all of the CalPERS board members, they do elect the governor and the legislators who fill the handful of appointed positions, so for all practical purposes, CalPERS is well within the grip of the organizations that represent the fund's retirees. The teachers' union alone collects $1,000 per year from each of its 340,000 members, so that a $340 million annual war chest pretty much assures that not much is going to change -- at least politically -- until there's some level of chaos that overwhelms the status quo.

Those who are concerned about Romney's Mormonism generally fall into two camps: those on the secular left, like my friend, who are a bit suspicious of any religion, except maybe Unitarianism, and those on the religious right who consider Mormonism to be a perversion of true Christianity. Those on the left are already in President Obama's camp, so there would be no advantage in placating them with attacks on Mr. Romney's faith. Those on the right? Well, they will hold their nose and vote for the Republican candidate because, for them, having a Mormon in the White House is not nearly as bad as giving that Muslim guy four more years to ruin the country.

In other words, he’s all business, and his business trip to San Francisco for Sunday’s NFC Championship Game is what matters now. Will there be a reprise of this contractual tiff? Of course there will — he still knows right from wrong, he still has a year left on his deal, and nothing has changed in his contract, other than the fact that some of us needed to be reminded that it doesn’t match his performance.

Three more defendants who face nearly identical charges of murder and attempted murder still await trial, though their involvement was "qualitatively different" from the others, McTigue said. Two of those defendants, Jose Carranza, 32, and Shahid Baskerville, 19, were several yards from where the killings took place. The one who was there, Gerardo Gomez, a cousin of Alfaro, turned 15 that day and had been celebrating his birthday earlier that evening.

But the building's not totally devoid of utility. Think of it as a monument to what might have been.
That's not to say that illegal immigration and border security won't flare up at times, as they already have. Hoping to appeal to anti-immigration conservative primary voters and "tea party" activists, most of the GOP presidential contenders have jockeyed to characterize themselves as tough on border security and immigration enforcement. Some have courted Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, another nationally known illegal-immigration hard-liner from Arizona, in hopes of securing his endorsement. And Texas Gov. Rick Perry's support of in-state tuition for undocumented students and other policies that his rivals characterized as soft on illegal immigration hurt his campaign with base Republican voters.

We start with cocktails and mingling with the guests. Everybody dresses up (everybody but David Simon, who came in ratty old jeans). It was fun to see that the "Mad Men," just like their fictional counterparts, drink martinis and whiskey on the rocks. They also smoke like chimneys! That show has been a bad influence on them. Homeboy Jon Hamm, just back from New York, where his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Westfeldt, is in a play, had a wildly attractive two-day growth of beard. My fellow TV critics, both genders, kept wanting me to introduce them to him. He wanted to talk about the Cardinals and the Anheuser-Busch sale (not happy).

At Lounge ON20, Bruich is not the only star in the making. Pastry chef Elaine Baker  formerly of Grange, where she was widely respected for her precise and largely classic repertoire  appears to be taking her work to new heights. Her work ranges from simple brioche doughnut holes to a deconstructed Black Forest cake that managed to take apart my all-time favorite dessert and present it in a new and delicious way, including sautéed cherries that stole the show. Baker's Greek yogurt Napoleon may be even better, a tour de force of light, crunchy phyllo dough with layers of yogurt sporting the dense texture of a cheesecake.

This timeline will contract substantially if Iran continues on its current course. Because enrichment from 3.5 percent to 20 percent requires about four-fifths of the effort to enrich from 3.5 percent to 90 percent, Tehran's continued production of uranium enriched to 20 percent will dramatically decrease the time it would need to produce weapons-grade highly enriched uranium. Once Iran acquires more than 150 kilograms of uranium enriched to 20 percent -- which could happen by early 2013 if Iran's announced plans are realized -- it would need only 12 days to produce enough fissile material for a bomb.

Theriot shrugged off the Cubs' bluster, insisting they saw a sting to his comments that wasn't intended. Whatever the Windy City fallout, the whole exchange and the Cubs' Benedict Arnold reaction helped illustrate the malleability of a word Theriot mentioned often Saturday: loyalty. Theriot had a prickly start to 2010 when he and the Cubs went to arbitration to determine his salary. The process - already caustic because it pits the team against the player - was further troublesome for Theriot because he had wanted a commitment from the Cubs beyond the one year arbitration mandates.
