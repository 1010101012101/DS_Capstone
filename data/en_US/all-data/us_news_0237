The tasting menu at the Restaurant at Meadowood began with a waiter bearing a brown velvet pillow on top of which rested an amuse of house-made crackers, garnished with a minuscule flower and leaf from the restaurant's gardens. It looked like what a ring bearer might carry down the aisle. Was it edible, or was it a jewel?
Lithe and self-assured, Butz makes a prince in the romantic tradition, a heartbreaker whose heart is broken from the very first scene. The rest of the cast - which includes Whit Reichert as the First Gravedigger, Jason Cannon as Hamlet's friend Horatio and Anderson Matthews as Ophelia's father, Polonius - performs in the same adroit spirit.

At the center of cowriters/codirectors Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck's putatively randy romp is Jason Sudeikis, the Saturday Night Live veteran, still trying to get his film career going. He's Eric, and every summer for as long as he can remember, he has played host to a group of amigos who jitney out from Manhattan to get blotto in his backyard. Not that it's really his backyard - the place belongs to his dad (a cameo by Don Johnson), who rolls up in his convertible with his half-his-age date and announces he's decided to put the property up for sale.

Ohio State lost two national championship games, Michigan lost to Appalachian State and Toledo, the Rodriguez era divided Michigan fans and alumni, Michigan endured an NCAA investigation and hearing last summer, and now the Buckeyes are in the throes of their investigation and facing their hearing in August. None of the four rivalry games were closer than 11 points.

The Affton fire department does not need an increase and neither does the Bayless School District. Us senior citizens can't afford it.

Roy Cohn (David Wassilak), the corrupt New York lawyer who once assisted Senator Joe McCarthy, remains the sly trickster even on his deathbed, refusing to admit that he has AIDS.

The team would have the authority to decide on the stadium's design, development and construction.
And why did Dad call you that? Because "knucklehead" became popular in 1942 as a way of calling someone a stupid person, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. The word had been around since 1890 but jumped into the popular lexicon in World War II based on the character R.F. Knucklehead, who showed trainees for the U.S. Army Air Force what not to do. An example from the etymology website:
"Nathan Fletcher would benefit the most from a Dumanis exit but I don't see it happening," he wrote. "Way back when there were no official candidates neither she nor Fletcher had any luck getting the other to bow out. I heard Dumanis offered Fletcher a deal back then. Serve as her chief of staff and she would step down after one term and support him for mayor."

For the record, I’m not someone who thinks having a dog is remotely equivalent to having a child. And to those who sarcastically suggest that being an opinion columnist is more difficult than being a mom, I would say, unsarcastically, "No, it is not."

He has also been charged with breaking a federal statute that makes it a crime to lie about receiving a U.S. military decoration or medal.
On the surface, at least, Tehran sees the letter as a sign of weakness. “The letter begins with lots of bluster,” says Hussein Ebrahimi, vice-chairman of the Committee on National Security at the Majlis, Iran’s ersatz parliament. “Later, however, the American adopts a conciliatory tone and invites the Islamic Republic to negotiation. Obama pledges not to take hostile action against us.”

Another challenge is that Mataric, Robins and other researchers lack the resources necessary to run the sort of large-scale clinical trials that could answer some key questions: How long do the benefits of therapy last? How do the social skills learned in the lab translate to the real world? Which children are most likely to benefit? And how can researchers design robots to get the best results with the fewest setbacks?

He remembered no special talent — his brother, Jack, was the chosen one. But he absorbed his father's stories and he loved to dream and to create, like the time he and his brother built a model of the 1939 World's Fair out of clay and wax. At the movies, he surrendered to the magic of "Fantasia," and later escaped into "Pinocchio," a guilty pleasure during darkened times. The Nazi cancer was spreading overseas and the U.S. entered the war. Sendak's brother joined the military, relatives overseas were captured and killed. Storytelling, after the Holocaust, became something more than play.
Treasurer Anne Spano explained the cuts will cause the district’s expenditures to overtake revenues unless the state finalizes an amended proposal.
There is no simple way to land the job of your dreams particularly with the challenges facing new entries and existing employees, but a lot of these tips will help you show strong communication skills, compatibility and the knack for getting along with others. Our greatest president, George Washington, had more intangibles than anyone in his age of great men. He did not drive the revolution (John Adams), write the Declaration of Independence (Thomas Jefferson) or father numerous inventions (Ben Franklin). Instead, Washington is remembered because of his ability to unite people, his bedrock of values and his positive nature. Perhaps these ideas can help you create your own history.
I have no interest in defending the bullies who dominate sandboxes, extort lunch money and use Twitter to taunt their classmates. But there is no growing crisis. Childhood and adolescence in America have never been less brutal. Even as the country's overprotective parents whip themselves up into a moral panic about kid-on-kid cruelty, the numbers don't point to any explosion of abuse. As for the rising wave of laws and regulations designed to combat meanness among students, they are likely to lump together minor slights with major offenses. The antibullying movement is already conflating serious cases of gay-bashing and vicious harassment with things like…a kid named Cheese having a tough time in grade school.

Before we get into the degree of blame Cashman deserves for this disastrous development - in which the pitcher for whom the GM sacrificed the Yankees' No. 1 prospect, slugger Jesus Montero - know this: Steinbrenner fired general managers for far less. In 1983, then-Yankee GM Murray Cook was barred by the Boss from spring training for the first three weeks, then confined to his trailer once he got there, only to be replaced altogether at the start of the season - all for the egregious mistake of losing righthander Tim Belcher, the Yankees' No. 1 pick in the January amateur draft, through a loophole to the Oakland A's in the free agent compensation pool.

Matta was intrigued to see how his young but talented team would react to the fast-breaking Keydets (3-2), who have led Division I in scoring the past five seasons. They also were the pace setters in 3-point baskets last season, converting 11.3 per game.

Colorado prisons house more than 20,000 inmates, and yet Denver — ground zero for the state's most destructive drug subculture — sent just 21 people to prison last year for the felony of possessing such drugs such as methamphetamine or ketamine. Significantly, not one was someone who screwed up just once, twice, or even three times.

"Dralion" (2002): The elements of fire, air, wind and earth took center stage with this Asian-themed outing. But with 37 Chinese acrobats in the 55-member troupe, it felt back-flip heavy. Soon after the show opened, a thief walked off with some of its elaborate costumes, including a coat made of thousands of white feathers. But the show must go on -- and it did, for six sold-out weeks. An arena-sized adaptation of the show returned to the Rose Garden in 2011 with a slightly modified lineup. Grade: B-

All we can hope for out of this case now is for the courts to recognize the right of same-sex couples in California to marry, surely a good thing but little help to families here in Maryland. The state does not have a domestic partnership law equivalent to California's, and Maryland's highest court ruled several years ago that the existing ban on same-sex marriage was legal under the state constitution. That means the operative logic at work in the federal appeals court's decision would have no bearing here. No matter what the Supreme Court does, advocates will have to keep at the difficult work of securing votes in favor of marriage equality in the legislature.
Another key to retention is trust. Rix believes she's hired good people, and she trusts them to mind the till and provide good customer service when she's not there.
Some of the Sailors plan to continue with synchronized skating as long as they can. Although not many colleges recognize the sport on the varsity level, some, such as Maryland, have club teams that compete in national tournaments.

Most Gothamites are going to blame this on the return of Carmelo Anthony, because this is what they do — point the finger at the 4-for-11, six-turnover guy. Help yourself. But the fact is, he tried to do the right thing early in the game — even with icicles hanging from his jumper — and it was early in the game when all of them let this W jump across the river.
The game took 4 hours, 4 minutes to play. There were 137 plate appearances, 42 hits (23 by O'Fallon, 19 by Edwardsville) and 30 runners left on base (18 by the Panthers, 12 by the Tigers).

The painful rise of gasoline prices across the U.S. may have finally reached its end, for now. But analysts said more time is needed to determine whether this is a peak or just a pause.
This has a demented symmetry to it: The loose cannon that Rex Ryan named an offensive captain was tossed from the huddle — shunned by his teammates, banished by offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer (ostensibly, without Ryan’s blessing) — and then he was defined by the most respected voice in the locker room, a guy who defines the character that should serve as the foundation for championship teams.

He and others say there is no single reason. But one explanation lies in the discretion states were given, starting in 1996, to design their programs. California, for instance, allows families with higher incomes to receive welfare than would many other states.

Anyone who buys that argument obviously missed the November 2005 special election, when labor unions, including the CAN, banded together to spend tens of millions to defeat Gov.

“I'm sensing the Ravens really want Rice back, but the Ravens have too many great players to sign to go nuts on him. Even though they paid Haloti Ngata $12.2 million a year on a five-year contract in September, I don't see them going anywhere near that for Rice -- and certainly not in the Peterson league. Baltimore usually finds a way to sign the players it really wants to sign, and I know it wants to keep Rice.”

The sidewalks today are, at best, a nearly constant obstacle course of cracks, fist-size holes, jagged edges, random angles, foot-size holes, butte-like gaps, shoots of Rebar growing from crevices, and occasional mine shafts that seemingly would swallow a small horse. Every block is a pint-size diorama of post-earthquake horror from the "Big One" - only with no earthquake.

But all too often, the airline's new schedule will not work for you, for the reasons mentioned or others. In that case, my suggestion is that you go online and work out what would be acceptable to you, call the airline's reservation agent (you really can't do this online), and give the agent your preferred option. That approach works best when you confine your alternative schedule search to the original line. If you can't do that, expand your search to partner lines: you can identify them by looking at your original line's frequent flyer program pages. If that doesn't work, you can certainly try a non-partner airline, but your chances then get pretty slim.

Clontarf Black Label ($24, 750ml) is a dynamite blended Irish dram that not everyone knows about.

It's also key to realize that once you file against someone in small-claims court, those people can in turn countersue you. In my experience, many people use this as a scare tactic with hopes that you will back down from your claim. But if you are prepared for this, you needn't be swayed. Judges see defendants try this tactic daily.

Q. Dear Marie, I have a small Spitz mix who is about 10 years old. Rocky acts like a puppy and is healthy and fit. About two years ago, he started licking inanimate objects. At first, it wasn't an issue. But now he does it every night right before bedtime. His favorite target is my pillow. Often, when I get ready to come to bed, I find that he's been licking my pillow to the point of it being soaked. It's pretty disgusting. And he knows he's not supposed to be on the pillow side of the bed. He's only allowed at the foot of the bed. But he is so obsessed; he breaks rules that he always followed before. I love my dog and I hate to lose my patience; but at night, when I'm all set to turn in and am suddenly faced with the fact that my pillow is drenched in dog spit, I'm not very pleasant. I've been evicting my dog from my room, which makes me feel guilty by morning. What's going on here and what can I do to get him to stop this habit? – Bert, Laguna Woods
