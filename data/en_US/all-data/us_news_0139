This past year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated its climate zone guide. Nationwide, a warming trend has advanced northward. Planting guides suggest gardeners can experiment with new plants typically grown in warmer regions. That doesn't mean I'll plant bananas and pineapples on my farm.

One of the potentially fatal diseases caused by smoking is heart disease. Interestingly, smoking may affect women's heart health more dramatically than men's. A new study by the University of Minnesota and Johns Hopkins University found that female smokers are 25 percent more likely to develop coronary heart disease than men. Why smoking causes more heart disease in women compared to men has been explained at least partly by gender-based biologic differences. It has been suggested that women may extract more carcinogens, or cancer-causing substances, and toxins from each cigarette compared to men.

Why they’re here: Brady Hoke made the best hire of the offseason last year when he convinced Greg Mattison to leave the NFL to coordinate the awful defense at Michigan. All the Wolverines did was improve by nearly 100 spots. That’s right, 100. Another great move by Hoke: leaving Denard Robinson alone and letting him do what he does.
The $2.55 billion gain during the first quarter was a 22 percent gain from the $2.05 billion earned during the first three months of last year.
The only thing that was a negative was the reaction from (former San Francisco) Mayor (Gavin) Newsom from the time. I think (current) Mayor (Ed) Lee has done a fantastic job of creating a relationship between the 49ers and the city of San Francisco. As the fans get more used to the idea that it's a reality you get rid of some of those feelings that were there.

• Delonte West was having one of his bad nights. He was sort of out of it from the start and a couple of times just didn't even cover his man in transition. Once, Mike Brown called a timeout because he was so upset when Baron Davis just waltzed in to the basket and West was on the other side of the court. Delonte did not play at all in the fourth quarter and I did not see him after the game in the locker room. This week in a mailbag on Cavs.com, Delonte answered a fan and said that he is bipolar. At the start of the season when he went public in his battle with a mood disorder and depression many people thought that he was indeed bipolar, but as candid as he's been about his struggles this was the first time I had seen or heard Delonte actually say it. This is what he said responding to a question from a teacher who works with boys who have mood disorders:

Exhibit B: Those grilled Mushroom and Naya pizzas (each, $11). Both consisted of platter-sized ovals of crispy crust, tasty and perfect underpinnings for the imaginative toppings. The sauteed wild mushrooms with garlic sauce and brie may have been a more well-balanced combination, but the Naya's layering of white sauce and smoked gouda cheese along with roasted tomatoes and grilled onions was more creative, if a little too unctuous to finish.

I know there are some who fervently believe the St. Paul plant could have been kept open if the state of Minnesota had been more proactive, imaginative and willing to open its checkbook.

"I'll tell you something else -- we don't like paying millions of dollars for Mrs. Obama's vacations," he said. "The NASCAR crowd doesn't quite understand why, when the husband and the wife are going the same place, the first lady has to take her own Boeing 757 with family and kids and hangers-on four hours earlier than her husband, who will be on his 747.

Pizzarelli is now one of the most respected interpreters of the American Songbook, but much of his wit and grace can be traced back to those good times on the bandstand with Kemble.

But we need more from the district attorney candidates. More details, more facts, more information about the level of their commitment to remaking the justice system in a way that works. Realignment should be a key issue in this campaign, along with the others outlined in The Times' "The Next D.A." series: juvenile justice, three strikes, the death penalty, and public integrity.

The Ravens are expected to have some contact with Rice's agent, Todd France, at this week's NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis to at least discuss the parameters of a new contract for the two-time Pro Bowl running back. If an agreement isn't reached by the March 5 deadline for teams to apply the franchise tag — and it would be somewhat surprising if there was a deal in place by then given the expected amount of money involved — the Ravens have indicated that they will use the tag to keep Rice under contract for 2012.

‘Safe,” the new actioner starring the foot-flying force known as Jason Statham, can’t be called a distinguished film, unless you consider “12-year-old Chinese math genius” an inspired plot point. On the other hand, taken on its own genre-adhering terms, it’s quite enjoyable. There are zero surprises, but it looks good, moves well through a trim running time and wields its clichés with defiant aplomb.

Closed gap on Blackmon with impressive combine. His time in 40 helped assuage doubt about his straight-line speed. Snatches balls as much as he catches them.

Scottie would always greet me as I got off the bus, not only from loyalty, I suspect, but also because I'd always share my after-school snack with him. As I approached adolescence, and he got older, he slowed down a bit, and his legs stiffened with arthritis, but his tail wag was as enthusiastic as ever, and he still managed to follow Dad to and from the farm.

For those of us who watch from home, with no institutional or legal guidelines to govern our visual practice, it is hard to know what our duties are. We have not been officially sanctioned to do any kind of visual work; indeed, military officials sought to prohibit us from seeing the photos at all. But we license ourselves, driven by an insatiable hunger for pictures, aided by mass media and inspired by a vague First Amendment sense of entitlement. Certainly, there are laudable reasons for looking, for wanting to look. But in order to keep our spectatorship from becoming exploitative, from replicating in even a small way the harm to which we seek to bear witness, we need to ask why we want to look, what we believe ourselves to be doing when we are, and what purpose we think it will serve. Moreover, we need to recognize that our consumption of such images is ethically complicated by the circumstances in which the photos were taken, by the fact of the deaths recorded within them, and by their vexed status as both evidence and implements of a peculiarly visual kind of violence.

It was one of the first streets in Cleveland Heights to successfully integrate. I'm very proud of that. When other families decided not to go with integration and began to move out in the 1960s and '70s, my parents decided to stay. It was a great experience for me. That's probably why I feel so strongly about living in Cleveland Heights.

One could almost root for Stannis (as he has the most legitimate claim for the Iron Throne) if he wasn't so hypocritical and humorless. While plotting some shady, black magic, he (no joke) actually corrected Davos' grammar. He was that guy.

De Rossi, who was born Amanda Lee Rogers in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, began modeling at age 12. By 15, she had been taught by her older colleagues the trick of vomiting up most of what she ate to maintain the rail-thin figures art directors favored and the unforgiving camera seemed to love. She dropped out of the University of Melbourne's prestigious law school to pursue her acting career in Hollywood, where the pressure to look as if you hadn't eaten solid food in the last decade pushed her eating disorder to a new level of intensity. The desire to appear perfect at every moment was overwhelming, particularly for a sensitive young woman also struggling to come to terms with her sexual orientation.

Republicans expect to pick apart the compact and hear from various interests before any deal. Jones says it's not fair that racetracks didn't get new games when the Seminoles did. The deal's impact on Florida's $5 billion thoroughbred horse breeding industry deserves consideration, says Rep. Bill Galvano, chair of the House Select Committee on Seminole Gaming Compact Review.

The director Peyton Reed is used to working in italics. His "Down With Love" (2003) was an entirely italicized movie, reworking the plot mechanics and arch visual strategies of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson sex comedies of the late 1950s and early '60s, along with Broadway-to-Hollywood adaptations such as "Sunday in New York" (1963). It turned out more like a cinematic term paper than a movie, but Reed's willingness to go all the way—further than Doris Day ever did, at least before the ring and the fade-out—marked him as a director to watch.

Since the human genome was unraveled a dozen years ago, genetic testing has been cost-prohibitive for the average person. The promise was that this breakthrough would lead to a better understanding of myriad diseases and, ultimately, individualized treatments. Whole genome testing studies the interaction of our 20,000 to 25,000 genes with one another and with a person's environment. The $10,000 price tag, though, is expected to drop to $1,000 within the decade. When the tests become mainstream, doctors could face a dilemma.

Johnson does capture the rhythm of soccer. During a crazy, 5-3 Quakes victory over D.C. United on May 2, Johnson rarely stood still in the radio booth. He pantomimed the motions of players kicking the ball and goalies reaching for it as he called the action. Each time the ball got closer to a goal, Johnson's voice steadily rose.

"We're not excluding A-B wholesalers," Hoffmeister said.
Valor is a different animal. If you've paid attention, Valor hasn't gone over well because of numerous allegations — and things being proven — of the Eagles' escapades. Case in point — next year's football team will play in a new 5A league and play a full league schedule, but the games won't count in the league standings. I don't enjoy seeing kids penalized, but the Eagles adults are being taken to the woodshed and the kids are coming with them.
Last year, the Lions offered first-, second- and fourth-round picks to the Arizona Cardinals in an effort to move up and draft Patrick Peterson. The Cardinals declined the offer and took Peterson themselves.
SCS came into the tournament as the No. 1 seed. The Lions first game was against Armbrust, the No. 4 seed. Although SCS beat Armbrust during the regular season, "The kids seemed to be a little nervous and started off slow," coach Mike Thomas said. By the time the game was over, the Lions had cruised to a 31-6 victory. Josh Knepper led the way with 12 points, followed by Eli Jano with 8.

Did he learn that from watching the arcs of his parents' careers? "Yes, in the sense that it's better to have a career than a splash in the, a smash, a flash in the plan, oh my god — a flash in the pan. Yeah, you've got to tour and try to build up a fan base, and it's better to go slowly and hope that you can maintain some sort of career for your whole life. That's sort of the goal, and then everything else is just a bonus."

The car's Buick nameplate combines with its stout engine to also make this car a bit of a sleeper, though the 20-inch wheels and more aggressive front may key fellow drivers into the fact that this isn't papa's Roadmaster.
The Magi meet Mary and Joseph, and it's curious that the child is never identified by name as Jesus or Christ. It seems strange, but, as Landau explains, there is an intentional reason for this omission: "If the Magi in the first-person narrative come to the end of the story without ever using the name, this implies that they have had an experience of Christ without ever knowing this savior figure as Christ. The case of the Magi, then, raises the possibility that Christ has appeared to many people and yet not revealed himself as Jesus Christ."

“I do think that any time you’re talking about a league that has gotten multiple bids on a very consistent basis, that means there’s a lot of good teams, and that means you’re not held to a perfect standard throughout the season,” Stevens said. “That being said, you’re going to have to play awfully good to be in consideration for an at-large bid in either league.”

There are 80 "new" minigames, although they often seemed familiar -- which is OK, actually.

Answer: Yes and no. Both garlic and aspirin have anti-platelet activity, meaning they prevent your blood from forming clots that can clog your arteries and cause a heart attack or travel to your brain and trigger a stroke. So if you're taking both garlic and aspirin for their blood-thinning abilities, you could safely skip the "stinking rose" supplement. Drying garlic to squeeze it into a capsule can process the health benefits right out of it. (One study found that even cooked garlic lost its anti-platelet activity, though it could be brought back to life with a little fresh garlic juice.)

What he meant, for the short term, was perhaps a light rail link to BART in Fremont, but that wild applause got the big thinkers moving. Before long, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group was campaigning for a ballot measure for a half cent sales tax to bring actual BART trains to downtown San Jose and Santa Clara.

In conclusion, Goldstein writes about the system: "The Cardinals' system is, in many ways, fascinating one.

His family also opposes a requirement that it reimburse AEG its $3.2 million in pre-development expenses if the deal falls through for any reason other than the fault of AEG.

The old Whiskey Joe's was out on Rocky Point and closed due to hurricane damage in that furious 2004 storm season.

Both had gorgeous waterfront views, but Whiskey Joe's skewed younger, to college kids and young professionals out for a good time.

Every time I read about Budweiser, it is losing more market share. Sales were off 4.6 percent last year after falling 7 percent in 2010 and nearly 10 percent in 2009. Sales were off 4.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, despite (or perhaps because of) a trendy new advertising campaign aimed at young beer drinkers.

The grants would be funneled through municipalities, which cannot afford the FEMA-required matching funds, she said.

If you heard Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges were thrown into a film directed by Jon Favreau, I'm guessing these are the last five words that would leap to mind: comic book superhero summer blockbuster.

Since then, Leo has become a highly successful director, and Benny, after the blacklist, rebuilt his career on TV. But they haven't spoken in 30 years; Benny even stopped going to his favorite Chinese restaurant because Leo sometimes ate there.

About 20-million Americans are living with it. Half of sexually active people will develop it. And most don't even know they have it. H-P-V is best known for its link to cervical cancer. But did you know it can also affect your throat and lungs? That's what happened to Ben Zehavi. He said, "I could feel that there is some irritation in my vocal cords and I wanted to cough."
Still, it took a toll on Clara's parents, especially her mom. Janet Beatty just wanted her daughter to be OK physically, to not be constantly worried that she might stop breathing, or choke. She wanted her daughter to have the happy childhood that her other two children had had — free from the physical challenges and, yes, free from the constant stares of strangers when they were out in public.
The state of the economy is expected to be the pivotal issue for voters in November.
Rauschenberg's mother, a sweet, daffy portrayal by Lorraine Bahr, provides some light plot structure, with an ongoing slideshow of projected images from her son's early life. Only the slides don't fit her descriptions at all. She provides a taste of his poverty-filled childhood, where even at an early age, he had an eye for junk as art.
She told Chelsea Handler the bizarre anecdote on E!'s "Chelsea Lately" show.
Panera, among the stronger performers in the restaurant industry, said Tuesday that it earned $35.7 million, or $1.18 per share. That's just a penny over analyst estimates of $1.17 per share, and the company typically beats expectations by much more.

The CDC says the flu so far is striking very hard in parts of the South — Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi — and New York City. Illinois and Oklahoma also are reporting high levels of flu. It's what Jernigan calls expected levels for the leading edge of the winter's outbreak — and that latest count is for the last week of December, the holiday lull when lots of people are home from school and work and thus not trading germs as widely as usual.

But Diallo's lawyers said the immunity claim was off-base. They stressed that the U.S. didn't join in the 1947 agreement, and that an IMF spokesman said shortly after Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he didn't have immunity because he was on personal business during his encounter with Diallo. Strauss-Kahn was visiting his daughter in New York.

* Jeff Fisher is interviewing with Tampa Bay today. I could be wrong about this -- because only Fisher knows what he wants -- but the TB job could be a threat to the Rams' chances of landing the coach. The Bucs have a trove of young talent. QB Josh Freeman slumped a bit in 2011, but he's a good one. Tampa Bay has the pieces of a strong defensive line, and Fisher builds his defense with the front wall. Tampa Bay general manager Mark Dominik has a good rep. One major problem: team ownership is goofy. It's not reliable. Look at how quickly the Glazers turned on Jon Gruden. That could scare Fisher off.
