As incredible as Hubbard's setting and description were once again, there were a couple aspects that didn't quite live up to her debut novel for me. In particular, the dialogue didn't feel as natural, and in a few instances even came off as insincere. I felt like I had really gotten to know the characters, and it was hard to imagine them speaking that way. My second complaint might not be shared by those with a softer hear than me, but the ending, especially the last few pages, were just way too cheesy for me. Bria's journey hadn't been easy or straightforward, and to end things in such a corny way, felt false for me. But maybe I'm just cold-hearted. Finally, the whole no strings attached hookup storyline seemed a bit juvenile and pointless within the whole novel, the sort of tacked on component I'm not sure I would have missed.

LAST LESSON. Passions are not vocations, although they can be. I mentioned earlier that I started with an idea, honed by years of passion, that I wanted to be a teacher. I wanted to do this because of my interest in helping people see things more clearly and helping them lead happier lives. I learned about what it took to became and be a teacher in public schools, and didn’t want to do it. I decided to go to grad school to get a PhD so I could teach in college, but when I learned more about what THAT was like, I didn’t want to do that either. I taught at a charter school for a while, but didn’t stay with it for too long. Them I figured out that I didn’t need to teach, per se, but that I just needed to help people learn and grow while still fulfilling my need to be “on stage” once in a while. So I went into HR, but found that I wasn’t on stage as much as liked. So then I went into training, and found I was on stage too much. And as I started to learn and grow professionally, and make more money, I kept searching for the job and the balance that would help me get the joys of teaching, and coaching, and counseling, and performing, without any of the crap that goes along with it – all while making a good living. And THEN, I began to realize that maybe I could do all of those things and pursue my passions outside of the workplace in stead of inside. So I began to blog, and host circle chats at conference, and join the ultimate narcissist website – facebook – so my passions would have an outlet, just like the clothes bursting out of that overstuffed bag. Goodness only knows what it will all look like when it’s done.
The principle location for our drama has now moved down to the harbour where our boat is moored and we are building a system for managing our equipment on the boat, a system that would gladden the heart of Heath Robinson - a knotty affair of pulleys, winches and fly-wheels, that has needed endless modification. Several days after we should be in the water we are still trying to make everything strong enough and balanced enough and not too heavy.
Regardless, I’m in my late 40s and racism is ingrained in the experience of my generation. My experience tells me it is more common among white people than most want to believe, or care to admit for political purposes.

So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
The same holds true for those of us who lead the Christian life. We must bring our bodies. . . our flesh into subjection to be an example of Christ to others. We must take control of our lusts and our desires. We must always train ourselves to live Godly lives. To shine His light to others. We must run our race and not give up. No matter how sore life makes us, we must keep going. We are in this to win!

USA Today reports on “a troubling re-emergence of an anti-government movement” that hearkens back to 1995, when Timothy McVeigh-angered by the government’s botched 1993 raid of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas-detonated a truck bomb outside the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people. In the past three years, there has been growing concern over activities of so-called “sovereign citizens,” who “claim to exist beyond the realm of government authority,” according to a January FBI bulletin to state and local law enforcement officials warning of the potential for violence.

I find "lack" to be an awkward word. It feels rather rude or abrupt when you say it, it feels like it needs a prefix or suffix to make it complete. Perhaps that's as it should be because when someone is coming from a place of lack they feel that they need something to be complete and their interactions are often abrupt or awkward.

Hashemi asked them why. One of the girls who remained sitting—who is very active in school and who Hashemi sees as generally very “integrated” into German society—explained that, when students like her register for classes, they are placed in the “NDH” category, “nichtdeutsche Herkunftssprache” (translation: non-German language of origin). In other words, before they have stepped a foot in the classroom, a checked box on a school form differentiates them from their “regular German” peers.

In keeping with the FDL architecture, an engine is assigned to a two-point stroke. Two engines will be provided in the first release candidate, arrowed lines and arcs. The start and end arrows are optional, so these engines provide a back-door to drawing lines and arcs. Not sexy, but the existing line decorators are applicable, so it’s incredibly easy to draw dotted or dashed lines.

Well, I feel as if I’ve been through a serious battle and recovering once again. It wasn’t quite as serious as the time the enemy had laid me out for two years. I had literally been frozen. Incapacitated, with fear, because of his lies. Post traumatic stress. It had me in a deep depression and panic attacks would come and go. At times I thought I would never function again.

This weekend I have to prepare a photoshoot of our home for an interior design magazine (I will tell you all about it later).

Two accusing glares bore into me and my cheeks flush. "Uh, well, I guess I didn't feel like there was a good time to tell you something so sad and scary, and I didn't want to upset you, so . . . um, I just didn't tell you. I don't know why. I'm sorry. I guess we should have talked about it."
Rated R for some violent scenes and use of language. (Vey enjoyable for Rickmaniacs, who will be greatly surprised to hear Alan and Emma Thompson speaking with Southern American accents. Not to mention that their roles seem to have an on-screen spark that constantly threatens to burst into flame.)

"Reading this book is a serious test for any food writer. Not only has Alex Watts done what all of us say we would like to do, tested his mettle in a professional kitchen, he also writes about his experiences so well that you spend as much time being jealous of his writing skills as you do of his experiences. It's an annoyingly enjoyable read." - Simon Majumdar

My own history includes what I thought would be a good decision. I was wrong. True story. My own marriage devolved to the point that my wife once said to me “I wish you would hurry up and die like your dad should have done years ago”.
As I mentioned above I am not familiar with the original short story that this graphic novel is based on. There are some interesting concepts in here. Basically they are around the type of society Edwer ends up living in. Imagine a society with no currency except the honor that you have as perceived by others. Kind of crazy right? Crazy and interesting all at once. Then imagine that everyone in this society wears masks and speaks using a variety of musical instruments. Yep, the society just got a bit crazier. Now...imagine that some one is murdered and you have to figure everything out, having not lived in this society and having a limited understanding of what the heck these people are doing. It makes for an interesting story on a number of levels.

Okay here's something weird. You and Savannah were in my dream last night. Savannah was my roommate and you were at our apartment just hanging out. You decided to decorate our whole living room with Christmas stuff (which looked pretty amazing). We just sat and talked for a long time...we got along so well. lol. You had decided to move to Mansfield, TX (not sure why there. It's about an hour away from me) Either way, just thought I should share that with you. Your thoughts?
To say I’m at my wits end doesn’t really cover it. And what is most ironic about this, I know that my stressing about the situation only makes the situation that much worse. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, and many days I wonder if the key to eating in general is to not care where I get the food from, but to just enjoy eating again.

Hello! I am posting a card I created for this weeks PTI Make It Monday Challenge using Fruit Fusion Apple. I used the matching patterned paper collection, and added stitched borders to each strip. I used my wood grain embossing folder from The Paper Studio (Hobby Lobby). I do not own any of the Fruit Fusion dies so these lil apples were cut by hand. Kind of tedious, but I still think I can survive without the dies. lol

Les Soldes are going on again so I've been doing a fair bit of shopping. As I perused the racks of a nearby store last week, an American family walked in -- mom, dad, two young boys. The boys ran around the store yelling and playing hide-n-seek behind the clothing racks, and sometimes behind other shoppers, while everyone else in the store gave the parents the stinkeye. The parents didn't even try, didn't even seem to notice their children shrieking and running through the middle of the store.
Eventually we came to another station. The attendant started to wag his finger. I thought they were closing. The driver talked to him and found out that they were out of diesel, which was the fuel the current car needed. However, they had plenty of benzine, which our van back on the border needed. Further, after we had filled the gas can, he said that he would stay open and wait for us to drive back with the van to fill the tank.

Hello fellow blog followers! So the interview I had last week went well. I am on the substitute teaching list at a charter school for middle and high school students. I haven't gotten called yet, but was told that I could be as busy as 3-5 days/week. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. I have had a few chances to network with business professionals around the area through chamber events and local business groups. I have a busy week ahead following up on employment leads such as: short term marketing positions at 2 local coffee roasteries, and a possible sales position at a software company. Those are the job leads that would be based out of Sandpoint so far. In addition to that, I am also working on sales opportunities with a couple logistics companies as well as an audio and web meeting solutions co. You know the old saying, "if you throw enough stuff on the wall, something's gotta stick"! If anyone has any other ideas I am all ears. :) When I'm not job hunting I spend my time biking up mountains, and finding new trails to run. Back to Kare...

Rise On has an underlying samba feel with the alto sax, flute and voice reading the theme. The tune is basically a showpiece for Gary's alto with John's delightful glissando occasionally stealing the spotlight. Chris Hinze's Who Con See The Shadow Of The Moon opens with the alto sax, arco bass and voices playing and even dirgelike line with the alto flute playing over them, eventually brushes and electric piano are introduced to apply a marchlike tempo under the line, then the rhythm section breaks into a controlled dark-baroque feeling for a brief solo and extended bass solo.Bamboo Madness offers a catchy theme played by the unique combination of bamboo flute, acoustic bass and percussion.
Network marketing techniques aren’t free, however, you also shouldn’t just depend on purchasing marketing materials. Classified ads, document, ink, mobile phone expenses, there are many points you will need to take into account, but make sure you keep a percentage of your revenue for engineering advances. New approaches for advertising appear frequently, so you ought to have some cash set aside to cover those fees, as well.

This blogger lives right there in that area and will undoubtedly be there this weekend. He is an example of the type who have a strong pro-Northern point of view, in the posts, but that doesn't necessarily make his information wrong or anything like that, just partisan. Pretty much all the blogs have some POV or other, so we may as well just see it, recognize it, and get used to it. The pervasiveness of the spin just shows that the subject is still important.

I thought this was such a cute project! I found this super cute wood hanging and I thought I would doctor it up with some awesome October Afternoon Sidewalks goodies! I used the saying "You are my sunshine" because my mom would always sing that to me and my sister when we were younger. I will never forget that. It was a vinyl rub on that filled the hanging perfectly. I made all of my photos black and white for a more uniformed look and added yellow twine to allow it to hang.

Early last week I stumbled upon Goodreads, a website dedicated to reading. I suppose it's a bit like Facebook in that it's a bit social, a bit networky, only its purpose is more particular. I haven't fully explored it yet, and I probably never will, but I've joined and begun the ride. It appealed to me because I can never remember what I've read and, thus, have a tendency to buy the same books twice, or even three times. I'll start reading and think: "this seems familiar." And Goodreads allows you to see, once you've input them, all the books you have read, and all the ones you want to read. I could, in theory, do that anyway by a) looking at my shelves or kindle, and b) writing out a list, but lists get misplaced and, well, it takes more than a glance at my shelves to show me what I've read. So I joined Goodreads for no other reason than to keep track of my reading.

But just then something begins to happen to Maki. His skin begins to take on a silver sheen. His muscles begin to expand. His eyes bulge out and form into an almost insect-like shape. Soon even his physical size starts to increase. Within seconds Maki has completely transformed into a bizarre alien creature, as gigantic as the monster he faces. But this new alien is very different from the reptilian beast. It has a basically human shape, though its face looks something like the insect-eyed aliens of various UFO legends. On its chest is a glowing red V-shaped mark. The aliens face each other, ready for battle. Just then Sara fires upon the reptilian creature. It turns, ready to snuff out her tiny life. But the humanoid alien stops the reptilian. Soon they are struggling with each other, threatening to tear apart the entire bunker.

The barbaric crimes (ritual murders) committed back then, was complicated by the fact that the crimes were committed in three different locations. Also, --- the killings were premeditated by two different tribal chiefs namely, Mankopane, captain of the Ndebele tribe, and Mokopane, captain of the ba ga Kekane, -- a breakaway branch of the Kekana tribe. The names of these respective savages carry numerous variations; --- for example, the Ndebele form of Mankopane was Nonkupane.

For this new edition, we needed an overall title. West of the Moon was my working title for Troll Blood and all of us – my publisher, agent and I – had a soft spot for it. It seems to express the longing for adventure that Peer and Hilde both feel, as well as hinting at the strong fairytale and fantasy elements of the story.

I thought for sure this was it! I’ve bought tickets in the past and never felt as confident as I did yesterday. I had my interview speech memorized and my first purchases lined up. The salesman at the boat store, where I put my yacht on layaway, is going to be very disappointed when I tell him I didn’t win. Not to mention, the realtor who had the paper work written up for my own private island. Today is going to be a day of dream crushing, my bad to all those people I lead on. I really thought I had found the golden ticket. Damn you randomized numbers. I guess they weren’t lying when they say chances are 1 in 175,000,000.

For video, I’m going to run Cat6 throughout the house and use HDMI extenders connected via Cat6 to everywhere we want a TV. The HDMI extenders cost $35 each and work great. I bought one and tested it over 150 feet and the video was flawless. One of the sub-contractors proposed a $600 HDMI extender that does the same thing. They don’t understand that digital is digital; it either works or it doesn’t, quality is the same in the digital world.
If you knew your parish religious education program was evangelizing hundreds of non-Catholics and fallen-away Catholics, wouldn’t you put a few bucks into the special collection for that ministry?
You see, for every inspired Beatles cover version there are at least 6,000 which ignored the sage wisdom behind the cliche "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" (or, as a forthright ex-colleague of mine used to say: "If it ain't your concern, don't f__k about with it"). To cover a Beatles song effectively, you've really got to do something surprising with it, something which either shows the world what weird really means (The Residents) or something which highlights raunchy or aggressive elements of the track some of us might have missed (Otis Redding's version of "Daytripper").

The court heard that during 2010 and 2011 he discussed what life-sustaining treatment – artificial ventilation, or artificial nutrition, the provision of food and water by tube – he should receive in future. He had, the court was told, indicated that he would wish the treatment to be withdrawn. In November last year the man’s wife downloaded a living will form from the internet. Her husband consented to the advance decision by blinking to his wife and the witnesses who included a doctor, a social worker and a carer. Another carer, however, raised concerns over whether the father had really ‘communicated his agreement’. Under the Mental Capacity Act, living wills are supposed to be written. However, the documents are still recognised if the individual concerned indicates their decision in front of witnesses, and allows somebody to sign on their behalf in front of witnesses. Mrs Justice Theis said it had been established that the carer who raised concerns in the XB case had not been present when his advance decision was agreed. However she said it was important that advance decisions were prepared with clarity and said health authorities should investigate concerns urgently. Therefore the issue was not about whether XB had the right to have the ventilator withdrawn and the issue was not about whether or not XB has a "right to die" but the issue concerned the validity of the living will that was written by the wife of XB and approved by XB through a series of blinks.

I loved this view of the wall at the top of the gardens, though we had to wait forever to snap this without cars in it. We later learned ourselves that every car coming into the estate is sent through this gate and along the perimeter of these gardens. Once again, we lucked out with the crappy weather. I’m sure there’s no chance in Hades of getting a car-free shot here on a nice spring day!
It always sounds archaic when Labor staffers refer to the Coalition as Tories, but behind the scenes the ideological divide between the parties is real enough. It is a debate about how equal our society should be and whether we should redistribute wealth to achieve it.

The final session of the day was just so lovely. I got to participate in a simple yet inspiring little workshop about "Giving". We listened to some lovely little stories where someone's gift of generosity has caused such gratitude in the heart of the receiver. Then we spent some time thinking about what we want our kids' experience of life to be like (as kids as well as adults) and what default feelings we want them to experience as they go throughout their lives. We brainstormed the issue of giving to others, without thought of receiving anything in return (although the natural side effect of giving is that WE feel good!), and about there being an abundance in the universe from which to give. Such a great way to live, and so lovely to authentically model a lifestyle of generous giving out of a heart of love and gratitude.
It does so at its own peril.

Furthermore, if you find that the crystal pattern you love is a little more expensive than you were anticipating don't be surprised. The high price is most likely because of the product's hand-made nature. While technological advances continue to change the market, most fine crystal is made by artisans with ages of experience behind them and this experience is reflected in the cost.

"Nearly 60 per cent of original wetlands have been destroyed on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario, even more between Toronto and the Niagara River. In some parts of southwestern Ontario, the loss has reached 90 per cent, one of the highest rates in the world." “We have to take care of the little things. If we’re successful in taking care of the little things, little things become big improvements.” "In the past, wetlands were considered breeding grounds for mosquitoes that should be drained or paved. But they are to be treasured. They brim with more life than any other ecosystem — 200 species of birds and 50 species of mammals are dependent on wetlands, which are often sanctuaries for endangered species."

And if I stay with the analogy and agree that the Jews were thrown out of several houses over several periods, is there not a difference to their being thrown out into their own back garden as opposed to the street? What if the pedestrian had intentionally stood underneath the falling man instead of stepping aside or trying to break his fall instead of being an unwitting and accidental victim? And what if the pedestrian had actually refused to allow the fire exits to be used and had blocked them up? Would he be so innocent then?

Forgive the name of the blog – I couldn’t resist it! I chose it because it describes what I want to do here. Not whoring in the ‘oldest profession’ way, but in the sense that I will be using my body to make money, by cooking, eating and reviewing. I love food, but limit myself by being a vegetarian. That said, I will cook absolutely everything, and love experimenting with new ingredients and recipes. I have three very unvegetarian children ,who range from ‘yellow food’ fussy to ‘will eat anything, as long as it is expensive’ and a husband who will eat absolutely anything at all. Over the years I have watched him eat an ox’s penis, a baked toad, live prawns, crow bile, all sorts of fungi, crickets, scorpions, silkworms, snake skin, sheeps eyes and pig ears.

This could have the effect of making a different kind of distinction between speech and writing, however, as I’ve also noted that extraverts’ “talk” is often more like a kind of etch-a-sketch type of activity–it isn’t necessarily seen as the final/contemplated draft of ideas that introverts are more likely to perceive it as. I’ve talked a lot more about this here…

I took a little look through several beer blogs today, to see what others were saying. I ran across an odd menagerie of sites, most of which had some professional connection for the author. The ones that didn't were mostly home brewers, and those guys had their heads in the right places. The ones that were just self-promotion, well, they professed to know the most while at the same time contributing the least to my understanding of a beer they were reviewing.

3. For how great things besides has His boundless Goodness and illimitable Greatness made, which we do not know! When we lift the gaze of our eyes even to the heaven, and then recall it from sun, moon, and stars to the earth, and there is all this space where our sight can wander; beyond the heavens who can extend the eyesight of his mind, not to say of his flesh? So far then as His works are known to us, let us praise Him through His works. “Generation and generation shall praise Thy works” (ver. 4). Every generation shall praise Thy works. For perhaps every generation is meant by “generation and generation.” …Did he perchance mean to imply two generations by that repetition? For we are in this generation sons of God, we shall be in another generation sons of the Resurrection. Scripture hath called us “sons of the Resurrection;” the Resurrection itself it hath called Regeneration. “In the regeneration,” it saith, “when the Son of Man shall be seated in His Majesty.” So also in another place; “For they shall not marry, nor be given in marriage, for they are the sons of the Resurrection.” Therefore “generation and generation shall praise Thy works. …And they shall tell out Thine excellence.” For neither shall they praise Thy works, save in order to “tell out Thine excellence.” Boys at school are set to praise, and all such things are set before them to be praised, as God hath wrought: a mortal is set to praise the sun, the sky, the earth; to come to even lesser things, to praise a rose., or a laurel; all these are works of God: they are set, they are undertaken, they are praised: the works are lauded, of the Worker they are silent. I desire in the works to praise the Creator: I love not a thankless praiser. Dost thou praise what He hath made, and art silent of Him who made? In that which thou seest, what is it that thou praisest? The form, the usefulness, some virtue, some power in the things. If beauty delight thee, what is more beautiful than the Maker? If usefulness be praised, what more useful than He who made all things? If excellence be praised, what more excellent than He by whom all things were made? …

Do you have any big travel plans for the summer time? I know we will be going to the beach at least once, and going back and forth from our water park almost every day. Travelling every day can take its toll especially on your car. To keep our vehicles safe, I always try to keep a good distance between our car and large semi trucks, but sometimes their wheels send rocks my way and I get a chip in the wind shield or a ding. When we bought our car it was used and I noticed a small chip in the windshield. My husband took it very seriously and actually took it right over to our local Saflite AutoGlass center. They were amazingly fast and very inexpensive. There are so many things we can do to keep our families safe while we're on the road. Here are my 10 tips to keep your family safe on the road (with some tips from Safelite Autoglass!):

How digital technology is reinventing cinema – By 2015, it is expected that almost every cinema screen will be digital and that film projection will all but die out — but that’s just the tip of the ice berg, when it comes to digital cinema.

In the HOPE Court, a judge tells a probationer that instead of prison, he will be permitted to return home, where he can continue to work and provide for his family.

If he is not in compliance, he is placed immediately in county jail for the weekend.
So, I'm doubting he took the bus to his photo shoot with Richard Branson, in which they looked like what they are, a couple of aging smug bastard wanna-be hippies that are actually richer than fuck. They offered up $25 million in prize money to whoever can come up with a contraption that can reduce carbon emissions. Now, I'm no rocket scientist, but gee, don't most contraptions (or at least the manufacturing of them) use electricity? And isn't a lot of electricity generated by burning coal? So what we would have here, besides a failure to communicate, is something that would generate more carbon emissions while supposedly cleaning up carbon emissions. Hmmm, I wonder why no one's claimed the prize yet?

We were out there celebrating life, MLK, black history month, great music, and awesome musicians. We were out there dancing for a good 35 minutes before the Police showed up. Like it was planned the boom box was turned off and I had to find my ride quick. I got stopped by excited mobbers that wanted to know who organized it and when another one was going to happen. As far as I know The Dream LLC is a one hitter quitter. This was it folks if you missed it, you missed it.

The health food people in my life right now are fainting dead away. But MOST buttercreams are not just butter. When it’s all butter it has a cloying taste that sticks to the roof of your mouth. You need to add in some milk, vanilla extract and shortening.
In a regular bar or restaurant, if a customer becomes overly intoxicated and starts bothering other paying customers, they will probably be given a warning or two and eventually be asked nicely to close out their bill and leave. It doesn't quite happen like that in a strip club. Sometimes customers might be given a warning or two for their bad behavior. If the customer fails to comply with the rules consistently, no one will ask the customer to leave. They will tell the customer to leave.
The event was the 12th earthquake measuring between 7.0 and 7.8 to strike the region since 1900, and the fourth such event since 1990, according to USGS earthquake data.

Imagine what it would be if you went through your day without having anyone recognize you, without having anyone know your name, without anyone acknowledging your existence. How long before you would think that you had gotten lost in the twilight zone?
He sleeps through the night now. He is still in our room in the cradle, but that is because we need a fan in the other room, and well daddy just hasnt put it up yet. I am ok with that, I like B right by me. We decided I would not be going back to work, so I am officially a stay at home mommy. I need to get my blood pressure under control so that I am healthy. I think if I put my mind to it, I can loose weight and be healthy. I am already under what I was before I got pregnant, but I was that a week after giving birth!!!

So I've started to look for inspiration & ideas & it seems that US brewers are leading the way in experimentation in this field, none more so than the Avery Brewing Company who have released this video where Andy Parker, Chief "Barrel-Herder", talks about his passion & hard earned expertise in this field.

The story just plain made sense. I’ll admit, I was doubtful, I mean a story about a bunch of princesses forced to dance? How could that ever make sense, let alone be enthralling? But it was. The reason behind their curse, the world that Reveka shoves herself into, it all hints at something much bigger. We never forget that there is the possibility of war on the horizon, we are aware that the world the zmeu is from is much larger, much more intricate, I never doubted for a second the seriousness of the consequences should Reveka fail in her tasks.
Boo-yah! Hello! These are the Babycakes Minis by Fluevog (I also have these Minis here), and I am in love. L is torn by liking the lovely tooled leather on the front and the buttons, with loathing the thick sole. I like all of them, although they are rather warm.

It occurred to me that this is how we are to reflect the image of Jesus for everyone to see. 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, “And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.”
I'm also re-evaluating how many irons I have in the fire, so to speak. What things have I committed to either externally or internally and which of them are keepers and which of them need to be cut? That is the question! I'm not sure yet but I know that I have too much going on right now. I'm thrilled to be part of a new (literally just starting) ministry at church but it requires some time and I don't have much of that so I really need to re-evaluate how I spend my time currently and what I can do to make sure I am allowing time for this new adventure.

Welcome to the second installment of Simple Saturdays. The embodiment of life in the Blue Collar household. We live in a crazy, fast faced world as it is and being a mother to two special needs boys, I know the meaning of busy. There is always some therapy or doctor appointment looming several times a week, not to mention that we home school in our home as well. Add in meals, laundry, cleaning, baths and somehow, there still doesn’t always seem to be enough time in the day to get it all done!
It wasn't until I had sons of my own that I realised how painful that must have been.

Dinner wasn’t anything super unique or special tonight. Mainly I was exhausted after a long day. I browned up the chicken quarters in olive oil, then covered them with lemon juice and fresh black pepper. Baked them in the oven at 425 for 45 minutes. Tasty lemon pepper chicken. Pastured chicken leg quarters are much smaller and tastier than regular chicken legs. There was a big difference between the two.

Below is this week’s summary of sentiment happenings:
Los Angeles has been enamored of the jewelry designs of London Manori since November, 2008. The reaction has been enthusiastic; in fact, the innovative designs have become popular with many celebrities-including Kim Kardashian, Michelle Money, and performer Lupe Fiasco-who are often spotted and photographed wearing London Manori pieces.

Well, I can't blame you. All I do is go on and on about this Chekhov guy and what a genius he was and how you should read his stories & cetera. You don't want to read those posts from me. You don't want to read Chekhov. What you really want is to hear about the book I'm currently writing. Yes, I know you do.

And then say something like this:
So - think about what it would do to paint everything white. Everyone can wear white or reflective clothing. All cars could be white. Houses, sheds, barns, and roofs could all be white. Roofs could be white or mirrored.
True? Or just a strong negotiating position?
May history remind us all
One household in a pleasant and well groomed suburban neighborhood, filled with attractive children, a beautiful housewife, and a dashing, working husband. That is the American dream. In the 1960’s, the time of the show, this was the ideal, and aside from a few minor differences, this ideal remains the same today. On the surface it appears perfect and beautiful, but there is always corruption or unhappiness, resentment or betrayal brewing beneath and being repressed while continuing to grow exponentially. Before his divorce, Don Draper was absolutely living the American dream. But it didn’t take much to see how miserable he and his wife, Betty, were. In fact Betty Draper seems to be the epitome of sadness, of discontentment. The show’s portrayal of Betty is subtle but devastating. “The super-housewife and mother Betty Draper, who has every material possession and serves up perfect meals in her perfect house, while remaining at all times perfectly groomed, lives a life of empty pointlessness and systematic betrayal by her husband” (Phillips). Through Betty Draper, the show captures the beauty of the American dream, and shatters it into millions of lonely, desolate pieces. The series shows us the “deceit and misery that was so often concealed under those rigid structures” (Phillips). It is almost an allegory for people today, pleading with us. The American Dream is shallow dissatisfaction, why do we continue to strive for it? Mad Men shows the attractiveness of the American dream, and then tears it down to its cold and bitter core, and watches at it slowly withers away into a devastating and riveting sadness.
I was trying to work. I swear. But Cockney + French = too much. Every time they started talking, I burst into tears. Here are some gems from the conversation I just eavesdropped on:
I used to have a ‘real’ job: I went to work every day and somebody paid me a salary at the end of the month. My contract came to an end and I could have applied for a permanent job, but I didn’t want to carry on in that particular role, so I didn’t bother. After a brief break a friend rang me up and asked if I was available… I said yes and, after an interview, I was offered a job that involved working three days per week. This seemed like a good idea as I already had a bit of freelance copy-editing coming in and I was doing a bit of teaching adults for the local university’s lifelong learning department. That job got made permanent and I got fed up with it so I moved to a new post – two and a half days a week – continuing to copy-edit and teach plus taking on other editing. I managed that for six years before I decided that life was too short to spend two and a half days a week doing a managerial job that I no longer enjoyed, so I resigned. Four years down the line I have a lot less money, a wardrobe full of clothes I never wear and a much more productive garden. No regrets.
The greatest moment in 2011 was that I graduated in December from UVU with my bachelor degree in Business Management! Yay! It only took me three years taking night classes to finish it, but I finished! I will walk at the commencement in April and more than likely throw a little party to celebrate. WooHoo!
And the animal activists applaud….

I don't know about you, but I spent most of the day yesterday feeling pretty sad.
So what to do now? I am not a politician, but passionately believe that politics matters to me and my patients – the current reforms show that more clearly than ever. I don’t think that the BMA passing comment is going to radically alter the reforms, and if it does – how much real good can it do now – the horse seems to have bolted.
Pieter Mulder noted this fact as well in an Address in Parliament. On Feb 16 2005.
“I told them, ‘Get the whole tape’ … and look at how I tell people we have to get beyond race and start working together,” she said, adding later: “I tried to fight, but I didn’t have any support from the United States Department of Agriculture.”
Sometime I imagine that I will wake up in the morning and magically be the sort of person who can wrap presents beautifully. I will keep a clean desk, I will keep a clean house. I will be able to wear clothes that fasten with ties without looking like I just escaped from being tied to a stake. I will speak softly and prudently and above all calmly, I won’t ever have to look back with chagrin at having run off at the mouth, I won’t rush into things without thinking or get spacy while trying to get things done. I will wrap beautiful presents.

I am so happy to be back! I have missed a few posts this year
Perhaps no apostle enjoyed a more productive ministry career than Paul; and judging from the letters of the New Testament, no apostle asked others to pray for him more than Paul. A coincidence? I doubt it. “And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ,” he wrote to the Colossians (4:3). “Brothers, pray for us,” he directed the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 5:25). “Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith,” he asked them again (2 Thess. 3:1-2). And if he wrote the book of Hebrews, as many suspect, he also made the identical request of them. See Hebrews 13:18.

In the case of heavy chariots, with four horses and such, Warmaster says to put them in a double sized base (80x80mm). So just use the 60x80mm base (ready to use with FOG) and add some fillers or a movement tray for Warmaster.
Any mention of the delay in affordable housing, aimed to counter gentrification, as project supporters like ACORN's Bertha Lewis argued? No.
I am old enough to remember a time when fast food restaurants were primarily staffed by teenagers looking to make some cash in a part-time after school job and college kids working to offset their tuition fees. Now these jobs are largely staffed by immigrants undoubtedly using them as a means to obtain permanent residency status so that they can eventually leave it and compete with Canadians in the labour market for jobs Canadians want to do. This is very evident in Toronto and the surrounding area.
so of course that makes it easier, too!

I just can’t stand the guy being around me, pretending to be nice to me, kissing me. I really hate that last part. But he does not seem to get it that we aren’t in a relationship anymore. But what is there to understand: it’s over… that’s not hard right? He even irritates me when he is not around. It’s the waiting… when will he come home, will he come home, what is his mood, how much do I have to listen to his stupid work talk. I just don’t care. He even annoys me when he sleeps. All the scratching, snoring, panting, groaning, turning in bed all the time. He also claims the blankets… well LW told me I do that too but hey… what do you want. All the time when I was laying in the middle (and that for like 3 years) they both hug the blankets. Then, for me in the middle. there wasn’t any blanket to feel, It’s like a tent over me. Well.. I can tell you, that’s cold. So I don’t blame me for being a blanket hugger because when I did not hug the blankets…. there wasn’t anything to keep me warm. But well… that’s one thing that won’t happen again because I’ve had it. We won’t be sleeping with 3 persons in a bed. Laying in the middle is bad for me, but for LW as well. Plus I just won’t lay in a bed with him anymore. I can’t sleep properly when I do. I am just laying there, waiting for things to happen. That’s not good for me. When we lay there with three, than there’s an elbow, then there’s a knee in my back. It won’t be the first time that I wake up with bruises. So there’s the choice, sleeping with me…. or sleeping with him. I guess I know the answer to that. So I guess I will be sleeping alone because otherwise he things he is just such a “sad little boy”. I have a feeling of throwing up now…
6) “It will happen when it is meant to be”
Motivating students and teachers alike, Harry inspires Paige Woodward (Cheryl Pollak, My Best Friend Is a Vampire) a frustrated popular girl to destroy her belongings and causes English teacher, Jan Emerson (the beautiful Ellen Greene), to stand up for what's right. I'll admit, I was mildly perturbed by the fact that Mark seemed to be attracted to Paige and not Nora at first. However, Mark does ultimately make the right decision and starts to focus his romantic gaze in Nora's general direction. Did he really think that Paige was Eat Me Beat Me Lady? Only someone as alluring as Nora, with her elongated neck and artistic temperament, could possibly be responsible for writing like that.
There were 17 games this year. While certain titles were obvious runner ups for me, it took some time to decide #3. Sure, I already pretty much had in mind what I wanted for the top 2, but the 3rd was especially elusive for a time. This was an…interesting…year for adventure games. You’ll start to see more and more “pervert” titles on this list. I mean, sure, I liked games like Leisure Suit Larry, but some of these are just ridiculous.
So far, no comment from Rick’s camp.
Towards the end of the meal he committed the ultimate blasphemy.He stuck his hand in the air and waved it around flag like until he caught someone's eye, then rudely gestured them over.This is tantamount to knocking on the bar for service but unlike the person who taps rudely on the bar for attention you cant pretend not to notice this particular performance.
“Finish your beer so I can get out of here.”
The casting here is absolutely perfect. Though Segel plays the same bumbling character that he always does, there’s no denying that he’s gotten pretty damned good at it, and if you’ve liked him in the past, you’re certainly going to here. Chris Pratt also gets his fair share of laughs, despite often coming across as a proxy for Paul Rudd – his expressions, his mannerisms and even his deliveries all feel like what you’d expect from a Rudd / Apatow pairing. But it’s the women who really steal the show: the gorgeous and hilarious Emily Blunt and Alison Brie give the film its heart, managing to keep the film fair and honest even when it becomes easier to choose one side of the plot’s core argument over the other. Plus, their Sesame Street scene together at the end of the film had me in absolute stitches.
What's set Colin off is the growing contention that keg beer has changed over the last forty years, and that some brewers who create amazing cask beers now also produce amazing keg beers. In Colin's strange little world, the fact that one has some carbonation and the other doesn't makes the one with carbonation evil. Some bubbles make, say, keg Camden Pale or Punk IPA more similar to Watneys Red than to their respective cask versions. And if we tolerate them, we'll all suddenly want to drink really shit keg beer again.

We also got to see a ton of Savannah and stop in at all kinds of bars. Our tour included McDonough’s (karaoke all night long), Hang Fire (the bathroom is particularly apropos to bachelorette parties here…just trust me on this one), 17Hundred90, and Moon River Brewery (where we toured the very spooky old hotel portion), to name a few. Afterward, we stopped in at Abe’s on Lincoln, which was another chill place with friendly bartenders. We’d all definitely recommend Tara’s Tours and Drew (seen above with the bachelorette herself)!

Local communities were dispossessed for such gimcrack schemes. The theory was from the Corbusian model of “uniformity in the part, variety in the whole,” which was necessary to produce the “house machine” or “A machine for living in”? This phrase says it all: treating people as machines.

I have recently read and reviewed Michele’s novel on this blog, so I risk repeating myself. How is a modern day Canadian woman, Lydia, connected to a lady in waiting to Anne Boleyn? Why is Lydia haunted by dreams of this woman? When she is sent her mother’s diary from long-lost relatives in England, the mystery begins to unravel… This novel had me hooked straight away. A great story!
Anyway, date 7 is a friend of my friend’s boyfriend. We met on a night out a couple of weeks ago and then he added me on Facebook after and we started chatting. He seemed pretty cool, so when he asked me if we could go get a bite to eat, I was down. So we met up and went to a cute little cafe. I did pre warn you, this story is not interesting. I have nothing out of the ordinary to report. He is a genuinely nice guy, and very good looking… Can anyone say potential!? I will meet up with him again later this week.

It has been more than a year since the last time I’ve been to Paris. The last time I was actually there was October 2010 because passing through in May 2011 to visit ma meillure amie doesn’t quite count (it was just a few hours at the Gare de Lyon). Every once in a while I like to look through photos I’ve taken while in Paris to feel sentimental and connected to the memories that I’ve made there.
A little narrative would go a long way. Tan would accomplish her objective in a proper way if we were allowed to know these prisoners and guards, allowed to take a stand for or against them according to real evidence and stories by which people of reason could make, heaven help us, judgments. I do not think that Tan denies the necessity of prisons or of correction, but she does suggest that these institutions are constructed and are open to injustice. If this were not the case, then why would we need to “confront our own prejudices and assumptions?” Tan is being political but does not take a stand or offer solutions. For this reason, this exhibition is not provocative, and I tend to think that many people will just pass through it, paying little heed to prisons or even human beings.

Once your tissue paper is cut to size, smoothed and taped down to the A4 plain paper, you then need to print your chosen photo....I have two options to print with my printer, from the rear tray or the cassette tray at the bottom and when I went to print it from the rear tray it was snagging the tissue paper (lucky it didn't rip!!) as its not all taped down so lucky for me I could use the bottom cassette where there was no snagging but I just had to be sure I knew what side the tissue paper needed to be on to print on the correct side.

Long story short she eventually went upstairs. My husband and I followed her upstairs. We tried to take something away from her which resulted in flailing legs and me getting kicked in the face.

Considering where the Packers were drafting and who was on the board at that time, Perry was an excellent fit. His size/speed and upside were to great to pass up. Dom Capers and Kevin Green will not put Perry in a position to fail, rather they will put Perry in a position to succeed. I believe Perry will start opposite of Matthews III and should be a double digit sack guy early in his career.
Years ago when I was a teen, a Kirby vacuum salesman came to our home. My mother answered the door and told the guy she was not interested. He became extremely pushy and even trying to forcing himself into the door. My mother had braced her foot against the door to keep him from getting in, but the guy was still trying. This is where my father showed up and told the guy with “fist in the air” to get out or he would do something he regretted. The guy left, but we soon found out that he had been causing problems like this throughout the whole neighborhood. We reported him and he never came back.
Though the room flickered in the light of her lamp, Sharia could see a dull pink glow emanating from within the salt crystal table, exposing a deep crack within. The unnatural coldness of the table appeared to darken the room around it, and droplets of water condensated to drip from its sides and pool around its base, eventually trickling off down the hallway Sharia just traversed. Yet it was the figure lying stretched out on the table that captured her attention.

She stops, sits down and starts talking to herself. It's clear that her Annika consiousness is having a few things to say about her suggestions.
The sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development. For us, it slowly develops as we move into adolescence, becoming firmly established in our late teens. The ego develops as a structure, creating a sense of ‘inner-ness’ and ‘walling us off’.

“If we look over the last 30 years, if the water is warmer or fresher, then we see lower abundance of Calanus,” said Andrew Pershing, a scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and the University of Maine. “We can expect in the future that the Gulf of Maine is going to get warmer and fresher.”
We are assigned a half dozen excerpts each week from a range of sources: apostolic fathers, apologists (those who explain Christianity to non-Christians), persecutors, and polemicists. Last Friday, I arrived at a reading by a man named Clement of Alexandria, whom I knew nothing about— only that he wrote in the late 2nd century/early 3rd century and was not the same as Clement of Rome. I knew because I had Wikipediaed the names when I downloaded the pages so I could make data tabs that would be of some use in sorting. And so I began to read from his Stromata (roughly translated, a patchwork of ideas) and as I did I began to sit up. My fingertips pressed down on the page as if to know the source better. I began to rise, needing to move, to respond as I felt myself—-what, what was it? Quickening was the word that came to mind, the sensation so familiar to a mother’s body and a writer’s spirit. “This is my guy,” I said aloud, instantly abandoning the idea of making my central paper for the course a subset of my thesis plans. Whoever this guy Clement was, I needed to spend more time with him.
Because of the environmental benefits, grants of up to £8,000 are being offered to tempt van owners to swap to electric ones. According to information from Renault, the cost benefits stack up if the vans are being used in London, as these vehicles are exempt from paying the Congestion Charge.

I think that as more people get ebook readers and as their non-tech-savvy friends see them using them and get to play around with the devices for themselves, then more people will start getting ebook readers, especially people who are older. I think we will see this happening in the coming years.
I have little knowledge about how the flatulence forms, but I am familiar with an ancient poem that may help us isolate an answer: “Beans, beans, the musical fruit. The more you eat, the more you toot.” -Shakespeare (1591) I happen to be especially gifted in this arena and capable of such control that I may tryout for the London Symphony Orchestra, if they have an opening in their Buttwind Section.

But even the most squeamish might want to consider flipping past those pages and reading the stories anyway because they're that damn good. She favors "one shots" (and many of her books are collections of unrelated or loosely connected one shots) but she can cram more originality, story and humanity into 30 pages than anyone I know. I've read many a five volume (or more) series that didn't have as much story as one of her one-shots. It's not just the originality of having capable demon-like humanoids demagicked and traded around like slaves or a blind monk finding and freeing a dragon trapped for eternity by an angry god or a trash-eating pond-god who saves the life of a half-killed human tossed into his depths by letting himself be the main course, though that's pretty wicked. It's the humanity she imbues into all of these half-human and human characters alike, with failings and foibles and misunderstandings and complexities that make them amazingly compelling often in just a few frames. Even people who do things that cross my "never cross" boundaries, doing things I absolutely would never condone are so sympathetic and believable that I find myself understanding, even sometimes sympathizing and forgiving (or at least understanding why the other characters forgive them). Since there are some actions I'm amazingly hard-nosed and unforgiving on, that's quite an accomplishment.

Contrast that with the 1960s, when Sidney Poitier was given the male lead in the interracial romance Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? To allay white audience backlash, the character he played was a physician of rare combined attributes: wealthy, intelligent, handsome, well-dressed, articulate, and cultured. The Cosby Show of the 1980s featured a doctor dad and a lawyer mom who raised beautiful children on good, old-fashioned, colorblind, middle-class values.

I’m convinced Jon Ronson is one of the best essayists/journalists working today. Whether he’s writing about psychopaths, amateur superheroes, bizarre military units, or cruise ship passengers lost at sea, Ronson is instantly engaging. The same can be said of his 2003 book Them: Adventures With Extremists. This book is a raucously funny, globe-trotting trip into a dark world of conspiracy theorists, KKK meetings, and Jihadi training camps. While it’s a funny and quick read, Ronson is also a trenchant and savvy observer, and as a result Them is an illuminating takedown of the paranoid and extreme.
I finally got a six pack of Shiner's 97th anniversary beer (see post below about how Spoetzl is releasing a new beer every year leading up to their 100th). I'm a bit disappointed to say that my anticipation exceeds the beer itself. That's not to say it's bad – it's actually a decent rendering of the black lager style. If you've never tried it – it's a pretty rare style – it is jet black, but doesn't have the heaviness of a stout or porter. Shiner has taken a nice shot at it, but it doesn't quite stack up to New Belgium's 1554, my first experience with black. It's missing a little something – there's a thinness to the taste, whereas 1554 has a warmth, a roundness to it that 97 lacks. The roasty taste is slightly stronger in the 1554 … or, for that matter Xingu or North by Northwest's Okanogan, other great examples. It's a creditable enough attempt – I'd give it a B – but I don't think I'll be developing the addiction that had last year to 96, the wonderful Marzen-style Oktoberfest beer from last fall.

The fossil centipede pictured belongs to part of the Geophilidae family. This species’ body structure resembles a worm or ribbon, and its antennae and legs are short. The fact that centipedes that lived 45 million years ago are exactly as members of the same family alive today is evidence that Darwinism is a terrible deception. The fact revealed by the evidence of fossil findings is that no evolutionary process ever took place; and living things are created by Almighty God.
First, let's get that coconut open! Coconuts sold in US supermarkets are sometimes scored with a thin line or crossmark to help crack it open. Start by holding the coconut firmly in one hand, with the scored section up, if any, over the sink. There will still be some coconut water left - you can simply drain it out or save for later. Then, with the blunt side of your cleaver or knife (for the love and continued good health of your appendages - USE THE BLUNT SIDE!), give the coconut a sharp thwack or two to crack it. Give it a quarter turn and another hard thwack, then repeat until the coconut splits in half. Watch this video for a helpful demonstration [fast forward to the 1:04 mark].

I have found that the most effective way to shop and cook for my family is by planning my menus ahead of time. I started doing this about a year ago and was amazed at how much money I saved by sticking to a list in the grocery store. I am sure this is not news to most of you savvy moms. But if you have not done this I highly suggest you give it a try. Immediately I felt the relief of always knowing what was for dinner. No more staring at the contents of my pantry or freezer and trying to figure out a healthy meal. No more opting for pizza because there isn’t any defrosted meat.

That rejection remains the core of the conflict. However problematic, settlements are not the main obstacle to an agreement.

Palestinian leaders dismissed those offers.

With the evolution of BSE's conceptual backgrounds comes a pleasant evolution regarding their sound and approach as well. While this is not to say that their previous albums were necessarily bad in any way, there were at times certain elements to their songs which could (arguably) detract and/or lessen the impact they would have otherwise had. Specifically, I am referring to the slightly awkward samples found on "Pursuit Of Pleasure" and the somewhat 'hit-or-miss' rhythms of "The Dull Routine Of Existence". However, it is difficult to conclusively state that these small nagging points are anything more than personal preferences, especially since they display an admirable willingness for BSE to experiment, evolve, and maintain a unique musical aesthetic. Regardless of these concerns, "No Lights In Our Eyes" is much more minimalist in construction then their previous albums, approaching 'dark ambience' at times, yet refusing to be pigeonholed into a specific genre.

The ECJ held that, when an operator of an online marketplace does not itself decide to end infringements of IP rights and to prevent further such infringements occurring, that operator may be ordered to take measures making it easier to identify those customers responsible. Although it is necessary to respect the protection of personal data, when the perpetrator of the infringement is operating in the course of trade, not in a private matter, that person must be clearly identifiable. Consequently, the ECJ found that EU law requires Member States to ensure that national courts are able to order a website operator to take measures which contribute not only to bringing to an end infringements, but also to preventing further infringements. Those injunctions must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive and must not create barriers to legitimate trade.

Every single one of us is equipped to help in some way. I see so many families (ours included) who find unique and different ways to help. Some are doing giveaways of various things. Others sell t-shirts (we just bought one today from here: http://seejoleighadopt.wordpress.com/). We are selling Avon, bracelets, tshirts, a downloadable song. There are people doing virtual yard sales with all kinds of things. The excuse cannot be that there is nothing that interests you. Because if you don't want to win a Kindle, someone will be giving away an Ipad. If you don't want an Ipad, you might want something from a yard sale. If you don't want anything there, you might want to buy coffee (may I suggest http://www.hopetohome.com/collicott.html). And if you don't want anything, collect your loose change for a week and contribute to a family from Reece's Rainbow!
being an all-round media genius, I think I've figured out why most of these films fail to really scare us. They all start with the audience on the outside looking in. We are introduced to these horrible scenarios of statism gone mad, as though we are watching from the moral vantage point of people living in a society that isn't, yet, quite that bad. We get the moral pleasure of shaking our heads and tut-tutting at the wickedness of (other) men. We watch the film thinking, "I'd be on the good guy's side. I'd be in the resistance and I'd blow things up real good."
What’s the rush? Why do we race around tiring ourselves out over trivial things? Live– in the great peace and comfort knowing that we belong to the family of God and he would not have us to be ignorant of our future and our hope.

Jesus did that. “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 14:6). Jesus brought the essence of heaven itself to earth within his being. He modeled that with his announcement of the kingdom, his healing of the afflicted, and his friendship with the estranged. He made statements about those who don’t believe and accept his ministry, but he didn’t make judgment of others the defining element of his ministry. Instead, he made the in-breaking of the heavenly kingdom the heart of his ministry, with the call to everyone to come enjoy the presence of the Father.

It was an age of awakening; new cathedrals soared into the medieval sky, their new gothic style testament to belief in God and Holy Mother Church. Mystics like Bernard of Clairvaux and Abbess Hildegarde of Bingen preached radical doctrines, The Knights Templar were at their zenith and the troubadours, the ‘Courts of Love’ and the code of Chivalry were all flourishing, thanks to writers like Cretian de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach. In France Abbot Sugar of St. Denis believed that high art was the way for man to aspire to heavenly perfection and the Cathedrals of Europe with their coloured glass, brightly colourful interiors and painted murals typified this belief.

Delirium Noël (reviewed by JM)—This was the beer I had been anticipating. After falling head-over-heels for Delirium Nocturnum, I was very excited at the prospect of trying the Delirium Noel, a dark Belgian ale. The familiar pink elephant that is the mascot of the Delirium products sports a Santa hat and winter scarf on the label of this bottle - a nice touch, I thought.The pour was a cloudy and rich amber color, with a good thick head that showed some staying power. On closer inspection, there was some sediment swirling in the glass, a constant stream of bubbles running up the side.

This first one is a typical Central PA farmhouse, stone with a metal roof. They've been building these here for a couple of centuries now, and the only change in the style is that tin roof. The columns on the porch are a modern innovation, too; in the 18th and early 19th centuries they were probably plain old shaved tree trunks.

The gecko can’t do much to control the temperature – she’s got tiny little fingers, she can’t really work the thermostat or turn the dials on the A/C. Sometimes, when there’s an incandescent light nearby, she can curl up near it and pick up some heat that way, but for the most part, most of the time, she just has to live with what the dog chooses. This is, of course, much too cold for her – she’s a gecko. Not only does she have no fur, she’s cold-blooded! The temperature makes her sluggish and sick, and it permeates her entire universe. Maybe here and there she can find small spaces of warmth, but if she ever wants to actually do anything, to eat or watch TV or talk to the dog, she has to move through the cold house.
The eulogies were beautifully written and vibrant in color. They were the stories of a girl who laughed often and loved deeply. The crowd heard of the child who shared her Oreos with a homeless guy. The story of winter boots left from “Mrs. Claus” was told by a teenage girl who remembered well the door-step package. Then there was the Kadie who wore pink bunny slippers to church every Sunday until Mrs. Mason stopped wearing her fur coat. They heard of the hospital volunteer who told a child his birthmark was an angel’s kiss. They were stories of a girl who dreamed she would change the world by sheer willpower alone. What she didn’t realize was that she had already changed the world because of her love. There were stories of pink tutus, sleepovers and summer swimming parties. Each story was another piece of Kadie; the only pieces left of Kadie. Mara sat there though, too numb to drink them in, too hurt to find a way to hang on to them. They washed over Mara one after another and like waves in the ocean, she knew each one was beautiful but it was impossible for her to capture them.
Reserve 2 of our strippers now for January 7th, 2012 at Hunter Mtn, NY. I have booked 2 girls for a 9 pm party at Hunter Mountain, so we will have 2 hot strippers in the area, if you are planning to head up to Hunter Mountain and need strippers call me 800-446-8847.
But the biggest changes have been recent. The area between To'ata and Vaiete has seen the return of some (but not all) of the docking sailboats and an ever-growing landscaped garden park that includes an enclosed child's play area as well as some lovely spots to sit and watch outrigger canoes glide in front of the setting sun. There are trees, winding grassy areas, paved areas for bikes, trees and flowers. As someone who's seen Papeete through it's worst years, it's hard for me to admit it, but the city is looking very pretty these days.
Up until about fifteen years ago, lavatory systems came in various hull designs, but the principle was the same: a very simple lever and returnable ballcock system that worked every time. Somehow since then, the Green maniacs have turned the elegant simplicity of ballcocks into duo-flush plunger bollocks.
Fuck. That. Noise.

‘O sancta simplicitas! In what strange simplification and falsification man lives!…Even iflanguage will not get over its awkwardness,a nd will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many subtleties of gradation…here and there we understand it and laugh at the way in which precisely science at its best seeks most to keep us in thissimplified, thoroughly artificial…world…it loves error, because, being alive, it loves life.’ I do not know how much of a misattribution it would be to read this as N- claiming that ‘life’ is a ‘will to error’ by necessity, and that therefore anything which is ‘alive’ or the products of living things, are by necessity riddled with error through and through.

Is it the responsibility of these companies to teach users how to use these outlets properly? Should parents, who have no knowledge or understanding of these social networking sites, be the ones to teach their kids?

Wait until they find out on Monday that we just qualified for a third island, which will provide space for many new kinds of dragons. And that I bought the Colosseum so we can earn gems. And maybe, if all goes well, that I will have bred a Bloom Dragon before it becomes unavailable on Monday (it's seasonal and very hard to breed).
And what does this mean for us as consumers? Let’s just say we will be able to keep a close eye on who receives what from who, and whether these monetary ties influence the news content.
Until my mother, my sister, and I moved away from our idyllic little Free State town after my father’s death, my life had been as perfect as any child would wish; but, like many openhearted and generous men, he had — while being incapable of turning away anyone who needed help (including a financially strapped church in another town)— failed to make provision for his own his family. So it happened that, soon after arriving in the ‘Big’and more judgmental city of Bloemfontein, where my sister had found work, my blissful existence was seriously marred. It was there that one of my new schoolfellows turned her back on me with a scornful, “Get away from me, you dirty Dutchman!”

I had intended on wearing the dress out of these tees to my Buddy's work party, since they were from last year's party. When St Paddy's Day came and went, the work party actually was postponed for various reasons to this May. So, putting off the dress wasn't a complete loss of plans: I had a couple of months to get something together.

As attractive as the building exteriors are, you can see some evidence from the masonry that these were amateurs and trainees, not experienced stonemasons. The CCC did hire "local experienced men" (LEMs) to supervise masonry and construction work and to train the boys in the skills. (Their hiring also helped quell fear in local communities that crews of CCC boys would steal jobs from local people during these recession years). On arrival at the CCC camps, the boys typically had no relevant job skills. By the time they left the CCC they could get work in the private sector doing stonework, or carpentry, or auto mechanics or cooks or whatever.

Now if I have 20 subjects I want to complete on Khan Academy, and each one has around 100 lectures. And each lecture is around 15 minutes, that leaves me with about 500 hours of material to review. Okay when I did that final multiplication I was like oh please don’t be in the thousands of hours… But 500 is still a lot, that is around 3.6 months of listening to lectures working on it 9-5. Now I know what you’re saying (and I’m thinking) oh crap, how is it possible to do that much in one summer? 3.6 months is longer than an entire summer, and working on it 9-5 takes some serious dedication. And you’re exactly right.
I didn't blog about that controversy because it wasn't a controversy. Yeah, the press is stupidly mainstreaming the "religion of peace," but if folks opposed the program they didn't have to watch it. CAIR, on the other hand, campaigns to shut down dissenting voices critical of Islam. You don't have a marketplace of ideas if powerful grievance-industry lobbying groups can shut you down with persistent complaints. That's the progressive modus operandi, and it's reprehensible and anti-American --- which is why neo-commies and Jew-bashers are down with it.

The bitch hasn't been feeling very literary lately. Sometimes you just want a life, don't you?
The one thing I love most about Fforde is his ability to mix genres into something completely unique. Shades of Grey is a humorous coming-of-age dystopic mystery that has something for everyone. At first, I had a little trouble adjusting to the strange world Fforde has created, but after the first few chapters, I got the hang of it. Eddie is incredibly easy to relate to, and I thought all the characters were a treat to get to know. There is a great deal of humor mixed in with what are really horrible realities of the world Eddie lives in so that instead of being horrified, I was thoroughly amused throughout the entire book.
Some plastics can be elastic as well. What I mean here is that some materials which we usually call ‘plastics’ (such as sheets of Perspex or bottles) can be a little bit elastic in nature. That is, they can be deformed (to a certain extent) either by squeezing or bending and they will return to their original shape. You can experiment on this elastic nature of ‘plastic’ bottles by squeezing them and letting go to see if they return to their original shape.
But what I do like is that I'm doing it. I am actually learning to run. My heart has not once leapt out of my chest, my lungs haven't exploded, and my joints and ligaments are still basically intact.

While digging out the weeds, I found a SAM! This is Jaidyn speak for a WORM. She and Savannah transported it to our house in the stroller's cupholder, with enough wet dirt for it to enjoy on the way. They then stayed outside digging in the dirt for more sams for quite a while. The warm weather attracted all the kids outside eventually to lay on the deck in a pile of blankets and pillows. They took turns serving each other the cut up apples and peanut butter sandwiches I made for them (well, to give credit where credit is due, Travis actually finished making the sanwiches by putting on the jelly). They were each the servant or the royalty getting served at one time or another. What a beautiful thing to watch my children play together.

Captain Britain and MI13 had come to an end, but Brian and the team were still considered 'active' in the background of Marvel Comics. Mentions of MI13 in Secret Warriors and Brubaker's Steve Rogers: Super Soldier still kept them active. Brian also appeared in Deadpool Team-Up and the Spitfire one-shot. But I'm sure the most significant memory for most readers came through this:

These figures mean that BrewDog value their company at over £26 million, which seems a bit top heavy given that their projected turnover for 2011 is around £7million. As I type these numbers, I hear the booming voice in my head of Dragon's Den's, Duncan Bannatyne stating "Turnover is vanity, profit is sanity". This hasn't, however, stopped various broadsheet financial journalists and City analysts saying that investing in BrewDog could be a nice little bet.

It is possible that (some) hanging bowls were specifically acquired for use in a funerary context and may not have had a use in ‘life’ at all. The cremation burials in Mounds 4, 5, 6 and 18 at Sutton Hoo were associated with fragments of copper-alloy bowls (Carver 1998), and a cremation burial in a hanging bowl was found at the nearby Tranmer House cemetery when the visitor centre was built (Sutton Hoo Society; Pollington 2003). The Tranmer House cemetery is tentatively dated at a little earlier than the mound cemetery at Sutton Hoo (Sutton Hoo Society), and weak stratigraphic evidence suggests that the cremation burials in mounds 5 and 6 may pre-date the ship burials (Carver 1998). If bronze bowls in general and/or hanging bowls in particular were already established as suitable containers for cremation burials, perhaps as a high-status alternative to the classic pottery funeral urn, they may have continued to be regarded as suitable grave goods when inhumation burials came into fashion.

Some complained that he reeked, but the complainer never looked for the source where flesh tore open and bled. Some tossed out moral and literal dress codes, while they slogged down shots and fingered the goods from those illicit shops.

You may be surprised to here this idea isn’t actually that new. I had the pleasure of meeting Sergio Mello, founder of Satisfly back in 2008, where he spoke to me about his forthcoming launch of his version of this product back in 2009 on Hawaiian Airlines. Whilst the concept may appear at first as a little alien, it’s actually a very logical step. It can be further used to put passengers that don’t want to be disturbed together too. Giving you better safe knowledge you don’t have to strike up a conversation with the person next to you so as to be able to climb over them to get to the toilet.
Also, I have done my best work after getting tenure. I am not one of those genius-people who did her best work by age 30 (or 35). Some of us get tenure based in part on our accomplishments, such as they are at the time of the tenure evaluation, but also largely on a gamble about our potential. (I am going to explore an aspect of this more in a near-future post.) In letters supporting tenure cases, it is common to see phrases like "rising star" or "steep upward trajectory" to describe the tenure candidate, in recognition of the fact that there is only so much that can be done in the tenure-track years, even by those who work 24/7.
As I began to read Alice Munro’s story “Leaving Maverley” for the fourth time, I was reminded how complex a process reading a story is when you have already read it once and know what “happens” in it as an account of events involving characters in the world.
It's fascinating that musical theatre today is essentially rejecting the entire Rodgers and Hammerstein revolution in this new millennium and returning to its roots in classical musical comedy. Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson is not all that different in its style and its relationship to its audience from Cohan's Little Johnny Jones in 1904 or Cole Porter's Anything Goes in 1934. We're embracing our roots and having a blast doing it. Even serious musicals like American Idiot, The Scottsboro Boys, Next to Normal, and Passing Strange have all rejected the R&H model. We're a much more cynical culture today than we were in the 1940s, and we require a fundamental honesty that R&H shows always lacked, as they tried to convince us that what was happening onstage was real when we all knew it wasn't.

Inside, the soft air from a fan blows against my green mosquito net, swaying the mesh back and forth, back and forth, as I take in the warm night of the May 1st holiday.
BUT.. this has been a really crappy week. Last Friday we were leaving my doctor's appointment and I told A my throat felt a little weird. Maybe it hurt a tiny bit but nothing big, I figured I had just talked too much and it was scratchy or something. Saturday morning I woke up and I was a complete and total mess. We ran some errands and I just had to stop and sit in the car for a lot of them. I was so sick by Saturday night that A slept on the couch because he was worried about catching whatever I had and not being able to make his business trip on Monday. I had a terrible sore throat, cough, earache and headache.

I’ve already seen a huge difference in my outlook as I’ve applied these themes to my life over the first few weeks of the new year. There is no doubt in my mind that God is a creative being (see some of my thoughts on the matter here, which I’m sure will be expounded upon) and that he put my creative heart in me for a reason – 2012 is all about letting it shine!
More problematic, however, is Roberts' continuing whitewashing of what she actually wrote at the time the case broke: "People want to conflate the crime and the culture. They want to say a crime did not happen, so therefore the culture that existed around that party did not happen."

It was arranged for the final stage of the experiment to be conducted in the city's largest auditorium. Free tickets could be had by taking a year's subscription to the sponsoring newspaper; and the public's response would have turned Barnum green with envy.

You know, if I said I had friends who could shoot webs from their wrists and fly through the city, you wouldn't just accept that at face value. That's only slightly less believable than Dwight Scharnhorst having friends who are gay who don't mind being compared to goat-fuckers.

I can’t exaggerate the number of “oh-crap-this-is-my-life” moments that I experienced throughout this episode. Hannah walks down the stairs, heading to work, and remarks, “It costs a lot to look this cheap.” She explains to her parents that she thinks she might be “the voice of her generation…or a voice of a generation.”Hannah pays way too much money to live in a crappy apartment in Manhattan. She says she is a writer, but the draft of her novel consists of three double-sided pages. She calculates that when her parents cute her off, she will be able to survive exactly three and a half days in New York City, if she is thrifty.
It costs a lot of money for me to travel to Cali. I don't mind - I just wish it were in my power to do it more. Having said that though, it is all the more precious to me each time I get there. There are things I love about Cali that are just IN me because I lived there. There's the silly desperation of seeing footage from an LA freeway in a movie or TV show, where I crane my neck to get a view of the freeway signs and see if I can get a bearing. There's the odd but endearing familiarity of seeing glimpses of overpasses covered in graffiti and ivy in a way I've only ever seen there. Those palm trees poking up into the smog and the sunshine. The familiar signs of motels and restaurants and stores that make themselves seen from the sides of the freeway. The way-too-many lanes filled with way-too-many cars. Yep - even that dumb traffic can make me feel nostalgic.
Well I'm off to sneak in a few pages of a good book before I go to bed early like an old person who has to wake up for work the next morning :) Planning on buying batteries soon and uploading more posts shortly! Night!

Now, 17 years later, there are several pro-life doctors in the Denver area. The tide is turning. As Bishop Conley said at the Mass on Saturday, "Science and truth are on our side." Those who deny that life begins at conception are like flat-earthers; they know they can't keep up the facade for long, so they try to change the argument from one based on science to one based on feelings. Truth is truth no matter what. It's not a feeling.
This is definitely a mixed post, but mainly it is about the writing that I am doing.
I was pleasantly surprised with how artistic this film was in its use of a remotely avant-garde shooting style and interesting editing. They did just enough of this to straddle the line of cinematic beauty while maintaining a popular appeal. The use of imagery was overt but effective and added to the tension. Unfortunately, it didn’t do so well at the box office, which is a shame because it was decent.

I mean if there’s any place at all I actually like looking my age it’s in Woodstock. Even if I wasn’t at Woodstock (as opposed to being in it) young people look at me like I might have been and that’s all I need to feel- something like an old statue covered with leaves and pigeon poop but nevertheless still there- rooted, timeless, ageless, looked up to (literally) by an entire generation.
Of your long, long dark night
So, where to go on my first venture? Not telling. No, after the response I got from my daughter and ex-husband on my pick, I’ve decided not to tell anyone where I am going. My lunch bunch (fellow teachers) thought I would let them know for sure. Nope. They would just look at me like I had a third eye. My daughter guessed that I was going to an Indian reservation. I had to laugh at that. I told her it was a bit out there for a solo traveler, but I thought she was really thinking out side of the box. I have to give her a few points on that one.
On the second opening, headed up just "Families" I wrote, among other text, "Some children have two mummies or two daddies." Ros illustrated this statement appropriately. This seems to me to be incontrovertible fact, at least as far as the western world is concerned. The book has had three starred reviews in the US, which is where you might have expected a book containing this statement to be not so well received.

We learned a lot from our visit with Lafayette’s beer-drinking art lovers last Saturday night. It prods us to renew our commitment to our own craft. We will continue to tweak our flagship ale, LA 31 and perhaps introduce our own larger than life artwork, an over the top IPA.
I have noticed that you have been falling below par lately. I do not mean disrespect, but I overlooked your paper-thin walls and grimy disposition at first. However, your recent development of black mold makes me feel wiggly inside. Your walls are deformed, you have a smokey-cat aroma, and we neither smoke nor do we have cats. Now the last comment is in no way your fault, but the creepy old man who seeks my attention and tells me he "watches me" then follows me around, has really tipped me off my rocker.
The strips of green are 1/4 inch strips of Old Olive, crunched and wrinkled then add some Cherry Cobbler ink direct to paper. To get the worn look, take your Aqua Painter and paint over the whole strip which will bleed the Cherry Cobbler ink into the cracks and crevices. The leaves are made by folding a piece of Old Olive paper in half then punching out just a small portion of the fold with a circle punch. It doesn't even matter what size, but I would recommend something at least 1 inch or larger. The edges of the leaves are sponged with Cherry Cobbler.

Now I have nearly all the clothes that I need for this spring, summer, and my vacations. I still need a few more tops for work, and a new bathing suit would be nice, but overall, I am pretty well set if the warm weather ever comes back. And I feel good about my options. I got a few things I normally never even would have tried on. I picked up a few things that were outside my comfort zone to challenge myself. And I thought about how I wanted to look in the pictures that I’m sure to have taken. Rudy and I have decided to get at least one professional picture down there. I don’t have any recent photos of me, though Rudy promised we’ll fix that soon. I want nice clothes so when we do take pictures, I look nice.

The bf told me something very valuable a day ago, after we had a debate/discussion about whether or not masturbation makes you want to have less sex with your partner. Don't laugh. I think it's a valid topic that deserves discussion between two people who are in a relationship, I don't know why you wouldn't agree. I was inclined to believe yes, based on personal experience, but in the end I concluded no. And I learned two things while at it.

Without pausing she told me she was also reading The Tale of Despereaux. I immediately asked if she had already read The Adventure of Edward Tulane.

I found it a very interesting process and have been reflecting on it quite a bit with Cathy. Gabe Anderson, a member of Transition Newcastle who works for OzGreen, facilitated in a beautifully relaxed, welcoming manner. One of the highlights for quite a few people was that each of us was asked to spend five minutes telling the rest of the group about how we had come to be involved in Transition Newcastle. These introductions were spread throughout the two days and provided a great break from the rest of the process and helped build our sense of connection. As there were 15 people, it did take up well over an hour (out of about 10 hours work time) but it was time well spent.
Panela is made from sugarcane. It’s picked in the fields that are wild and green with the plants, mountains looming in the background. The cut sugarcane is hauled back to their farm with a factory. We visit most days for an hour or so to check on production, but workers keep it going all night.
But what do the aliens need the children for? Well, it turns out that they secrete a chemical which makes them "feel good." In short, this alien embassy is here to ensure that their supply of drugs is secure. The children, we're assured, "feel no pain" - they're simply strapped to a pump so they can give out the alien equivalent of crack cocaine. And, best of all, they can survive for decades like that! Hmmm.
Officially, Nowruz marks the beginning of the new year in the Iranian calendar. However, the main takeway for foodies is that this is one of the best times of the year to sample Persian cuisine.
Thank you, Ruth!

Anyhoo, tonight I hung out with Jen for the last time in a long while (which bummed me out). Some of you long-time readers have heard me talk about Jen before: She appeared in my very first post (about going to Magic Mountain), and has appeared many times since, during sad times and happier ones. I’ve known Jen since college, and she’s been a great friend that whole time, and I will miss having her so close.

Although not required by law, most bourbon whiskey is double-distilled. The first distillation takes place in a column still. When you visit a distillery in Kentucky and they show you the still, that's what they show you. It looks like a column. They're typically five feet in diameter and two stories high. Every couple of feet there is a porthole-like thing.
This is over the top. And furthermore I do believe our greatest threat is not from woman with bomb breast implants it is from a very specific sector of people. Those who style themselves as radical Muslims and have declared Jihad against the US and it's people/interests. I'm so very sorry if that offends someone out there who might come across my little corner of the internet and read my blog. But honestly, who the heck attacked us on 9/11 anyway? Who blew up the USS Cole, or more recently who tried to mail bombs to the US?? Al Qaeda that's who. Why did that do it? Because they hate our way of life, who we are as a people, and believe us to be infidels who much be destroyed. That's why.

The calf’s tawny brown spots are lighter than an adult’s, giving it an even more endearing appearance. I’m sure you can imagine our muffled squeals of delight when we got a close view of this curious calf.

Some people change countries for practical reasons; a new job, to learn a language or because there is no extradition treaty with the Unite States. Others have more romantic motives; a new spouse, dreams of finding Prince Charming or if he’s unavailable, to date an Italian (a real Italian, one with an Italian accent). Some expatriates are running away, some are running to and some are just running.

At no point during the entire process did anyone ask me for my “sample.” So, had I listened to my husband, I would had this sample in my bag, certainly not properly contained, for the entire morning. For no reason. Creepy.
So watch this space.
Hi there! Well, I still feel a bit like a chicken with my head cut off, but I'm slowly making progress. I think I need to take a minute, tidy up my house, fold some laudry, and then I can get back to project mania. I have managed to "complete" one today. I put the word "complete" in quotes because I am as done as I can be for now. Confused?? Take a look:
Its not necessarily that I’m becoming restless or anything like that, but after hearing one of the graduate architects talk to a high school student, looking toward his “next step,” architecture school, I found myself reflecting upon my own situation. I have a long way to go in terms of my architecture education and a lot of “next steps” ahead of me.

The awesome thing about place mats is that most are approximately 12"x 24" so if you use them as a mosaic tile sheet, you get double the square footage (mosaic sheets are normally sold by the square foot) at an already ridiculously low price (if you shop the discount stores and internet).

It’s quite a beguiling effort that doesn’t quite sound like too much from the Godwin canon over the years. As I said up front, it sounds redolent of the productions Somerset has recorded for Bryan Ferry on the likes of “Mamouna” or “Olympia.” Fortunately, Godwin still sings like himself and he would never indulge in Ferryisms that others have been known to indulge in. I’m talking about you, Davies/Kerr/Sylvian/fill-in-the-blank. The end product sits comfortably on a shelf with most of the cuts on Ferry’s “Windswept” EP – just without the added £800,000 worth of session men! The download is available basically everywhere, so you should have no problem buying a copy if you’re so inclined. The end result is yet another of the many pleasures that Peter Godwin can deliver, this time wrapped up in an enigmatic production that withholds as much as it delivers. More, please!
The very nature of the covenant of grace and of God’s declared purposes in the appointment and character of that covenant plainly shows that it is God’s design to give ample provision to the saints of an assured hope of eternal life while they live here on earth.[6]

Don't these look fun? The rainbow sprinkles are so cheery. I love them! They're like a celebration all wrapped up into one little bite. They're aptly named Birthday Cake Truffles and can be found at Momofuku's Milk Bar in NYC. These are my favorite but the compost cookie and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch toppings are so good too.
1)A lot of people have asked me about Poxitas. They are a very neat product but I haven’t found it outside South America. Its basically the equivalent of a short duct tape strip, like a plaster or band aid, made of a thicker material with a stronger glue. Gorilla tape is actually pretty good, maybe not as strong as a Poxita but close. Its worth keeping an eye out in case you come by something similar under a different name. On the meantime I can only recommend you using Gorilla tape which is outstanding, so strong that it cant be compared to ordinary duct tape. Keeping a couple feet wrapped around an old loyalty plastic card or a lighter like I do will allow you to have some when needed and you´ll soon see how useful it is on various occasions.

We were always on the move! Occasionally if we had several flights to climb and there wasn't a line for the elevator we'd jump in, but even with banks of elevators at the front and back of the ship, there was usually a long wait to board. It was faster to walk. Going down several flights of steps is easy to do, but going UP is a pretty good aerobic workout.

In the beginning of the year, I set a couple goals to try to improve my overall fitness and drop a little weight to get back to my average weight during high school/the later part of college. So far, I've dropped around 5 pounds, which I'm pretty pleased with. I've been eating a lot more reasonable (smaller) portions and have been trying to get more regular exercise - mostly in the form of running on an elliptical during the week and walking/running with Abby on the weekends. I'm very happy with my progress so far and have noticed that my energy level is up and my clothes are fitting a little less snug. Aside from a few bumps in the road in the form of a couple colds, things have been going very smoothly. I have dropped some weight, am feeling a bit healthier, and am still enjoying beer and good food. All in all, its been a great success so far.
But after many trips to Ukraine over the years and experiencing the post-Soviet transformation first hand (including the Orange Revolution), my ultimate conclusion after my last trip a few years ago was this: the transition in Ukraine is so slow, it’s barely noticeable.
He crapped out on me on round 4. It was stuff like, “when do we take a break?” LOL!! I loved it and thought he was going to his room and continue Xboxing but he actually stuck around and watched me. I think it was a surprise to him that I was able to do that. And even more surprising to me were two things I saw today. I was able to do a plank partially on my toes and I’m having a much easier time getting up off the floor. Yay!
Good solid mouthfeel, good carbonation. Its not light and clean but neither is it heavy and sticky. The hops are reasonably upfront, but not overly assertive and in your face.

This week, we read a biographical sketch: “Samuel Rutherford: Called Before a Higher Tribunal”, about a 17th Century Scotish Covenanter who worked to establish the Reformed faith in spite of the threat to his life. He died of illness before he could be hung, as his friends were. We also read a short article: “Confessions and Catechisms of the Reformation”, covering the definitions of confession and catechism, as well as a brief history of both.

In 1973, Norman Fox, a then recent graduate of Lipscomb University, purchased a portion of the Memphis based “Harlow’s Honey Fluff Doughnuts” franchise. At the suggestion of his wife, he dubbed his business “Fox’s Doughnut Den” and began cranking out a steady supply of delicious sugary golden rings. In 1977, the business moved to its current location in Green Hills. It was at this time that Norman purchased the beloved sign from Harlow’s for $1,200, and had it moved from Memphis to its new home in Nashville. Over the years, the neon beauty has become one of Green Hills’ most recognizable landmarks.
I lost the battle that day. But there's a whole season ahead of us. Surely, at some point, he'll get out on the field, right? He might even be wearing a green shirt, and socks that eat his legs. But I'm not pushing my luck. I'm just really glad we're on the VIP team, because every single parent and coach knows this battle and will sympathize rather than criticize. This world of kids that are a little bit different, but really can play soccer, is one you have to live to fully understand. Its full of acceptance, and tolerance, and love. And we're all here to support and encourage each other, because we know that next week, it'll most likely be someone else's kid, and there's nothing we can do about that either.

The second description is that these people have Tasted the Heavenly Gift. The fact of the matter is that this heavenly gift is not identified. What is likely being referred to here is the Holy Spirit. In other words, the second description is a literary introduction to the more direct wording of the third description. The third description is more direct, Partakers of the Holy Spirit. The idea that the Holy Spirit is the gift makes sense in light of what Jesus said about sending the Holy Spirit after He is gone (John 14:15-16).

My heart is drawn to Mrs. Kennedy in her obvious compassion for her husband. I identify with her sense of the weight of the burdens he bore, and with her desire to ease his distress. Although the responsibilities of the pastor do not compare with the weighty decisions of the President of the USA and their possible consequences of national importance, like the President, that’s where the buck stops if something goes wrong. And though the pastor is not involved in international wars, the spiritual impact of a pastor can have eternal results in the battle for good over evil.

I assembled an assortment of jams, mugs and spoons, and a note wishing them well despite the fact that my room had not suited their needs. As I walked past their door I heard them quietly stirring. I returned to my bedroom, closed the door, and began to ready myself for the work day.

The beers at the Lompoc are brutal and distinctive. Alcohol contents run high, as does flavor. There's also a particular feel that runs through all the beers that I can't describe. It reminds me of drinking mineral water, and maybe it's due to the brewery's plumbing or water source. They serve two IPAs, C-note, and Cenntenial. C-Note seems to be more in the vein of double IPA popular lately, but more bitter than delicate or floral. They serve LSD (Lompoc Strong Draft), a big monster of a beer, that looks dark and dirty and tastes mean. Both IPA's and the LSD have great potential to end one's night quick. A pitcher guarantees either a party or a nap.
There can be a lot of negativity on the Beer Blogosphere regarding the death of the pub industry. It is by all accounts something some people care about. One can only wonder why, when they can sit in their own nice clean homes necking cheap supermarket grog and not have to sit in run down tatty miserable pubs anymore. I guess for some people the glass is always half empty. To raise the mood I did think of a blog documenting all the nice things that happens to closed pubs. Things like being knocked down and a Tesco being built or a block of flats. A cheerful look as to how a dynamic market economy doesn’t leave decaying old buildings to rot but instead utilizes them for nicer uses than a dumpy pub. A counter weight to this blog about closed pubs, from the fella Mudge. You might be surprised to discover I can’t be bothered. So instead I’m starting the first in what might be an occasional series about closed pubs that have gone on to being something better and serving their communities in new and interesting ways.
The MAX, is competing against the Airbus A320neo. The ‘Neo’ is adding winglets — Airbus however, calls them “sharklets” — to the current A320 design, but they basically the same as the winglets seen on the modern 737 aircraft currently in service. Boeing still has some work to do though, as Airbus are still estimating 10% more fuel efficiency than the 737 MAX, even with these rather peculiar looking winglets.

To tell you the truth, would it be so bad if the world lived more like the Amish? Humans would get back to their roots. Communities would grow stronger and people would work together to build a new world that could sustain life without electricity. Or better yet, people would work together to build their own power generators, bring back electricity but completely off the grid simply because there will be no grid. At least not for a while anyway.
When my friend Sue came home from work one summer eve- ning in 2002, the last thing she dreamed of ﬁnding on her door- step was a puppy. She loved dogs and had two of her own, but she was cautious. She could tell this pup was a pit bull, and the dog was emaciated. But as she carefully drew nearer, the four-footed stranger smiled and wagged its tail. When Sue sat beside the pup, it climbed on her lap, smothered her with kisses, and wrapped its paws lovingly around her neck.

It was crazy awesome and incredibly humbling to have so many people there to celebrate with me. Family, friends from work, friends from church, friends I've known since college (one who drove from D.C. to be here this weekend). I'm not normally one to really "love" being the center of attention. I found my bridal showers and baby showers to be slightly awkward (I think it's the whole opening gifts in front of other people thing and then trying to "make it around" to everyone). But this was anything but awkward. Friend groups and family meshed well with one another, kids played and kept one another entertained, pink champagne flowed freely, and in all it was a lovely evening.
This was a 20# PR for her, but was a bit of a disappointment. See, the goal is 400#, so anything shy of that will be just “eh.” Elisabeth had 405# to her knees but didn’t finish because she was starting to loose spinal position, and she knows 20# isn’t worth a season-ending injury.

Tonight's post is all about using iPads/iPods in the classroom. My position is funded through a grant that also put iPad and iPod labs in the schools for teacher and student use. Therefore I have been doing a tremendous amount of research on using these in the classroom. I spent some time in an 8th grade math class and we (the teacher and I) conducted small groups during the period. The iPods served as a great easy was to engage students in quality mathematics, without a ton of prep time from the teacher. Many of our teachers are planning to use the labs for this purpose. During our small group rotations, I taught the students a partner game, the teacher taught a lesson, and the third group played an app related to the topic of study. I was very pleased at how well the students at this age level were engaged in learning. While many of the elementary classrooms I visit conduct small groups on a daily basis, small groups was new to this middle school classroom. I look forward to more opportunities to experience this type of student engagement in the middle and high schools!

Investment in Copper, JJC, was financed in significant part by carry trade investing; when it fell, the carry trade investments unwound, causing disinvestment and delveraging globally; especially in hot money flow countries such as IDX, EPU, ECH, RSX, EWA, EWY, EWD, ENZL, EZA, EWZ, INDY, EWO, TUR, EWT. The small cap shares, VSS, the emerging markets, EEM, fell more than the world shares, ACWI; these included RSXJ, KROO, SKOR, SCIN, BRF, and TWON. The emerging market financials, EMFN, were deleveraged more than the world shares. Argentina, ARGT, a credit carry trade investment, suffered very significant deleveraging. The fall lower in the currency yield curve, RZV:RZG, beginning in August 2011 evidences the end of the Milton Friedman Regime. And the fall lower in the ratio of world stocks, ACWI, relative to world government bonds, BWX, in March 2011, reflects the exhaustion of US Federal Reserve Quantitative Easing.

A library, such as Burley’s, offers many opportunities to persons of all ages to participate in the culture of sharing – besides the pleasure of sharing a vis-a-vis conversation with another human being, ideas are generated, political debates made available to the public and the study of humanities are offered, currently one from the Smithsonian Institution – the definition of both a local and a universal culture.

Major props, if you’ll excuse the expression, for the best freakin’ commentary devise I’ve ever seen on a dvd. He actually films himself watching the movie and, obviously, commenting on it. He’s got to learn a little something about the difference between commentary and reiterating what’s happening on screen. I imagine most commentaries are just voice recordings so that they can take breaks, but I prefer his way.
Honesty is one of the core values we teach our children. We encourage them to play fair, share, and tell the truth when interacting with others. There is another branch of honesty that is often overlooked – being honest with ourselves.

I'm especially excited about the flower petals on this piece. Months ago I had used round stickers (cut from a sheet of address labels, using a circle punch ) as masks on fabric when I was doing some surface design. I loved the random colour that ended up on the paper circles so I stuck them to a piece of freezer paper to keep them for "some future project". We'll, that day had come! I added a bit of sketching with a Pitt pen to draw in the leaves and stems.
For me, along with many people in the UK, we know that Easter is a religious holiday, but not one that we actively participate in. Many of us think more about chocolate eggs, the Easter bunny and four day weekends with family and friends.

International Women’s Day is recognised and celebrated in many countries around the world and the focus of the celebrations ranges from general celebration of respect, appreciation and love towards women to a celebration for women's economic, political and social achievements. Although originally a Socialist political event, the day grew in the culture of many countries, primarily in Eastern Europe. In many regions, the day has lost its political flavour, and become simply an occasion for men to express their

This is a ‘found footage’ genre film which is very difficult to make, for the reason that: every shot has to establish why there is a camera there…I really like that at the beginning of this film the viewer might believe they are watching a documentary, and it’s only when you meet Maria in the hospital that you think ‘oh hang on…’! I also think the starting premise of the story is great: that the Vatican has a school for exorcism, and that there are definite parameters for what constitutes possession.
But fear not! The torch reappears on Thursday, 21st June, this time in Dumfries at the far more reasonable time of 7.52am, and for a good half-an-hour. Then teeny jogs in Annan and Eastriggs before a final 10 minute appearance in Gretna, and then to England. The torch is in Carlisle by 10am, so that's just two hours with us.

Another gold leaf-adorned masterpiece of Goma Dofu followed. The pillowy round of sesame tofu encasing uni (sea urchin) was perched on a small pool of dashi, and topped with natame (a Japanese spring vegetable), fresh gratings of wasabi and of course, a piece of the glittery stuff. It was strangely soothing, with the delicate flavours softly embracing my palate. The expertly made dashi added salt and depth, while the wasabi lent a slight heat that elevated the dish (without blowing my head off).
"Common sense would suggest that exposure to cold, to damp, to draughts, should be avoided. Thus during the period mere jumping out of a warm bed and placing the bare feet on a cold floor or wax-cloth has often been the cause of serious illness.............Much more rest than is customary ought to be indulged in, no work requiring any strain should be undertaken.........It is excessive foolishness for a woman to expose herself to undue excitement, specially the excitement of a round of pleasure or gaiety. Social gatherings, dances, games implying physical exertion such as lawn-tennis, boating, riding or walking excursions - all these should be refrained from at such a time......Those who are in charge of houses ought not to forget that some days of apparent slovenly and half-hearted work may have a reason other than that of idleness and ought to lighten the burden of work to their servants accordingly..............Bathing is to be avoided, and in particular cold bathing.

First the WEF’s point about jobs losses is one that Germans will not be overly concerned about. “Germany’s jobless rate dropped to a new post-reunification low of 6.7 per cent in March, bucking the trend in other euro zone countries,” reported the Irish Times (here). It is difficult to see how the loss 11,000 thousand jobs (out of 2.84 million) would have any negative impact on the economy, particularly since the nuclear plants – with exception of the Krummel plant – will not all have stopped operating until 2022. Certainly no one wants German workers, or any others, to lose their jobs. But 11,000 is a very low number in the context of the unemployment figures. There is the fact that employees would have advance warning to secure new employment.

Headed by award-winning baristas, coffee at Oriole did not disappoint. It was not the best we’ve tasted but still good. We tried the piccolo latte and cappuccino. We loved the piccolo latte which had less milk than a regular latte with a double shot of espresso (i think). The coffee was rich, smooth and totally packed a punch.

The issue of Statehood has been the focus, or at least central to, a series of posts here on TNIL over the past month or so. The subject of Statehood was the focus of a panel we covered at the American Society of International Law’s Annual Meeting. The issue of Statehood also played a central role in the decision of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court to not open an investigation into allegations of crimes in the Palestinian Territories. I will try to briefly frame the issue in this post and suggest a way to view the legal criteria for the creation of a new State.

In the transitions program for which I teach, and in which I was once a student myself, positive affirmations are part of the plan for dealing with such difficulties, a strategy for getting a better grip on that harsh reality so as to change it. But while I know there is plenty of research showing that affirmations work, the rebel and realist in me has always balked at reciting drivel like “every day in every way I’m getting better and better” when there is clear evidence to the contrary. Along with Barbara Ehrenreich, who did such an admirable job of exposing the negative underbelly of the positive thinking movement, I have resisted being “bright-sided.” She says that the alternative to both positive and negative thinking is realism, an emotionally wise and thoroughly rational conclusion with which I agreed when I read it; it seemed sound as a silver dollar in its integration of positive and negative thinking, like heads and tails.

The light is fading and the sun has disappeared behind cloud, leaving a bleak chill in the air. Ducks and geese drift somewhat despondently across the water, while a big black crow flaps along the water’s edge cawing – there’s a sense of melancholy about this scene. I continue around the muddy perimeter of the upper pond, crossing the dam that separates it from the lower pond by a huge collapsed willow, to where a family are feeding bread to a flapping mass of squawking seagulls.

It starred Lindsay Lohan (before she started going to jail and in and out of rehab…) Well anyways, today is our own little version of Freaky Friday. Erika and I decided to switch places – she’s writing over on my blog Forever Twenty Somethings, and I’m taking you down memory lane here on TwentyTweets!

A comprehensive resource of one of the most difficult styles of music to pigeonhole, The Encyclopedia of New Wave is a great way to remember all those bands that you forgot you loved. From the obvious selections like Elvis Costello and Devo, to the more obscure acts like Communards and The Flying Lizards, author Daniel Bukszpan has you covered. Several paragraphs of history, commentary and anecdotes are shared for each group, along with full-color photographs, a list of members, and discography. This book provides an avenue to rediscover a few bands that have fallen off the radar, including several that are surprisingly still active in some form (Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Hoodoo Gurus).

While it played such a dominant role in the computer world especially in the 70s including its role in the development of the personal computer, it became the victim of its own success. Newer companies were grabbing the initiative and reading future trends correctly. IBM was like a huge super tanker; it could not maneuver quickly enough and make changes. It seemed to be stuck to its large mainframe computer world mindset. Bill Gates understood the importance of software and made a fortune out of it courtesy of a little help from IBM.

When Paul Birmingham talked about the father finding out that Isabel was missing, Nancy again interrupted Birmingham saying that the parents did not find Isabel missing because the mother went to work shortly before the father discovered Isabel missing. In fact, Nancy already had those little facts so she correct someone and sometimes embarrass them for not stating the correct information. I suspect that Nancy appreciates them not having all the facts and presenting them in the correct order because it makes her look so thorough when she gives out the correct info.

Really, the above is the reason for today's post. Not from a trans PoV, but that these old friends, I've not seen in 20 years plus. The last mental picture I have of them would be when I was secondary school or earlier (11ish?). Now, of course, these people are grown up, some with families of their own.

So what would happen if suddenly no more clean dishes would appear each week? My experiment is to see what would happen if I stopped doing the dishes. Would they get done? Would everyone revert to purely eating out? I don’t know, earlier I had to drink water out of a bowl like a dog, which might say something. It did tell me to get off my butt and do the dishes, which means the cycle is now back at the beginning. I guess I’ll see, and post results when something finally breaks. Whether it’s the garbage disposal or my roommates, I don’t know.

My first thought for the theme was kind of predictable - snowdrops - easy, especially as I already had the the lovely Sheena Douglass Spring stamp set.

Perhaps, it is to gain widespread support for protest against Yingluck’s government, and in fact, a key Democrat Party MP just Twittered today, saying the people of Thailand could rise up against Yingluck.

Erin Jackson - Definitely gonna catch at least one of these. Wednesday, April 25 @10:00pm - Beale Street Tavern Thursday, April 26 @10:00pm - Beale Street Tavern Friday, April 27 @8:00pm - At the ND Saturday, April 28 @7:30pm - Velveeta Room More info: The festival is slated to bring over 60 of the world’s best comedians both established favorites and up-and-comers to Austin, a city with an insatiable appetite for comedy and festivals alike. Spread out over 10+ venues around the city including the Paramount Theatre and Cap City Comedy Club, the festival will showcase stand-up, improv, sketch, musical comedy, and all of the odd and hilarious stuff in between. *A note to current and prospective badge holders. Single tickets will be available for each performance. The VIP badge grants you access to all performances, with no need to purchase an additional ticket. The “You Betcha I’m Somebody Pass” gives you access to each performance, except those at the Paramount. For Paramount shows, “You Betcha” badge holders will have pre-sale access allowing them to get a jump on the crowd for the big shows. The “You Betcha” badge, while giving you the most bang for your buck as a great overall value badge, gets you access to the shows after VIP badge and single ticket holders and does not guarantee admission. However, the Festival will hold a limited number of seats set aside for these badges at each show for those first in line, so early arrival is suggested. It is suggested that “You Betcha” badge holders also take advantage of the special benefit of exclusive pre-sale access to purchase single tickets to “must see” performances and ensure your entry.
In my personal opinion based upon the evidence this was a neo-Gladio style operation with a network of agents behind Anders Breivik, its just who are those agents and how high up the chain does it ultimately go?

I wasn’t a fan of City Hunter, all the plot loopholes made me sigh in frustration coz they were so in-your-face that I couldn’t understand how audiences could overlook the loopholes and still think the drama was good. I earnestly hope that this doesn’t happen in “City Conquest”: that the script holds water and is intelligent with good editing and pacing, and it doesn’t feature a weak-willed female lead. And of course, that Hyun Joong kicks ass and shows all the naysayers who’s boss. ^^v

Second I am really not sure why you would want to smoke a beer. I understand that smoke is a flavoring in many things like BBQ, whiskey, and cigars (sorry couldn't think of anything else) but why beer. I am all for creativity but smoke. There are very few things that smoke is good for and in my opinion most of the time beer isn't one of them. I think, if done improperly, it hides the taste of all the other ingredients that make beer beer.

I’ve ranted about feminism and the damage it has done to women before. It’s a sticking point with me that feminism paints itself as helping women when it so often causes harm. One of my biggest gripes against the feminist agenda is that it has convinced so many women to delay motherhood and put their careers first, perpetuating a myth that it’s just as easy to conceive in your later 30s after you’ve established your career as it is to conceive in your late 20s, when in reality, that is exactly when a woman’s fertility starts to decline.

But –and this is a very important but– as tends to ocurr in living systems, the memeplex went rogue and gave birth to emergent phenomena that were neither expected nor hoped for, like the fusion of different cultures in new ways of coexisting, new creative expressions and an increased tolerance of humanity towards itself. In so many ways, multiculturalism has made us stronger, not weaker, because despite their best efforts to make our coexistence forced and uneasy, the human spirit shines on that which we hold in common as humans, not what separates us as persons. What the tribal-minded elite never thought is that we could learn to use multiculturalism as a stepping stone to a very different end than they intended.
So is that why I'm so here and there? Why I struggle to finish what I start??

The textiles industry too has taken a beating. Low demand for garments in the US has shrunk earnings and contributed to the red ink in the budget. Under a US law, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), Lesotho has emerged as one of sub-Saharan Africa’s largest garments exporters to the US. AGOA allows qualifying African countries to sell textiles duty-free to the US. Yet a strong South African rand — to which Lesotho’s national currency, the loti, is pegged — has hurt the competitiveness of Lesotho’s second largest employer.
I am deliriously happy to be published. Marrying my love of history and erotic romance is a pleasure. But I am far from done. Just as I matured and ventured further and further from home and found a deeper and more profound appreciation for my private sanctuary, so too will I find a more complex understanding of the writing process. I want my storytelling skills to sharpen. I need my writing style to become more succinct and my characters point of view to suck the reader in so that they can’t stop reading. To do that I must write and practice. I hope that I continue my streak of luck and have more of my stories published.
