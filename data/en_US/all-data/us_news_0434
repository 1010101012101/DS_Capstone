øBotanicula starts out as an uncomplicated, joyful exploration where clicking on things results in fanciful reactions. While you are occasionally chased by spider-like things, you will quickly discover that they never reach you, and you can't die. However, the farther you get into the story, this sense of carefree exploration slowly changes as the environments you investigate get darker and the characters within more scary. At one point, you will even watch a gory puppet show where a dragon's head gets whacked off and the stump bleeds onto the stage. This disturbing scene, while short, is so out of place with the rest of this funky adventure that it is hard to fathom why it was included. The last chapter has some shooting sequences in which you can die and have to restart the section, but there is no blood.

This summer has seen a plethora of headlines on the topic. July brought news of a study showing an unexpectedly high occurrence of autism among fraternal twins, a finding that could implicate both genetic and environmental factors. Then new research revealed that younger siblings of children with the disorder have a 20 times greater chance of developing autism than the general population. Last month's story was British researcher Simon Baron Cohen's "assortative mating" theory. It speculates that parents who share certain tendencies — such as expertise in math and science — may produce children with a higher risk for autism.

Moving out from that center, the film, which was written and directed by Max Mayer, plunges Adam into a love affair with a beautiful kindergarten teacher, Beth; she’s played appealingly by Rose Byrne. Their romance computes—the common denominator is need—but it doesn’t convince, and a subplot involving Beth’s larcenous father grows terribly intrusive. Nevertheless, “Adam” succeeds at getting inside its hero’s mind and, more impressively still, gives us entrée to his singular soul.

But, longer term, the bankruptcy will have some possibly profound implications. Although the genie is out of the bottle as far as a Chapter 11 declaration is concerned, the genie might not do exactly as it's told.

So what could go wrong?
Screening also leads to over-diagnosis: the detection of tumors that are dormant, destined to regress without treatment or growing so slowly the patient dies of other causes before the tumor causes any harm.

Allowing electronic pulltabs in Minnesota isn't proving to be as easy as it once seemed. Although state revenue analysts are confident in their $72 million annual estimate, the figure does not include tax relief for the charitable gambling industry -- the group's main reason for proposing electronic pulltabs, and a reason the industry now views the plan as "problematic."

"I went to work, and then left for lunch, threw all of the (Sachet) outfit on and came down to the event all dolled up. We got a great picture of Susan Leal, Mayor Frank Jordan and I, and then five minutes later, I was taking it all off - and back to work."

Let's, for the sake of argument, say the Blazers clinch the No. 6 seed (they have a good chance of doing so), and the Lakers win tonight. That means the No. 2 seed could come down to the Lakers (who own the head-to-head tiebreaker over Dallas) beating the Kings. How do you cheer against the Kings on their last night in Sacramento?

"We thought it might be fun to borrow/pay homage to/steal an idea from 'High Fidelity' and have him go on a romantic pilgrimage and visit the girls that he dated and try to figure out how the hell he screwed things up with each of them. I donât want to give away too much, but he realizes that maybe thereâs something wrong with him after all."

Germ points out that the city is working hard to inform residents of delinquent income tax collection efforts and the amnesty program.
Spare me your cant about entitlement reform being hard to do. It's very simple, as The Sun editorial ("Social Security sets off sparks," Sept. 14) suggests. Simply adopt Clinton era tax brackets, and this should provide an adequate stream of revenue for all future government indebtedness. Why Bill Clinton, the last president in two score years to balance the budget, is not on the Super Committee charged with finding the golden mean of revenue and cuts to keep the government as we know it going is a total mystery to me.
It's tough to say if Lin is a system point guard in Mike D'Antoni's fast-paced, pick-and-roll offense or if he just finally figured out the NBA game.

Sam Littman, NBADraft.net: "USC power forward Nikola Vucevic, who measured 6-11.75 in shoes when he was thought to be 6-10, is not the type of player who will rocket up mock drafts because scouts are now confident that he will be able to play his position and not be consistently outmatched defensively. No, Vucevic now looks like an entirely different player. Vucevic was very much a classic Euro big man in his time at USC, showing off a terrific jump shot to complement a reasonably well-developed post game. With a 7-5 wingspan, Vucevic is as big as Greg Oden and is no longer seen as a tweener, but a legit big man who can get his shot off whenever he wants."
Even though the action phases stalled, the meetings had another effect, the founding of RIA, whose mission is to maintain and improve the Reisterstown commercial corridor.

Q: I'd like to stay on that. I've been actually looking deeper into the numbers of right-to-work states versus union states, and you're right. Right-to-work states have much lower unemployment rates than the other states. But when you look at the other factors, when you look at, for example, median income, of the 15 states with the lowest median income, 12 are right-to-work states. If you look at poverty rates, the 15 states with the highest poverty rates in the country, 13 of those are right-to-work states; if you look at the states that have the highest rates of uninsured people, of the 10 highest uninsured states, eight of those are right-to-work states.
And there is a growing feeling that Epstein will bring fellow GM Jed Hoyer of the San Diego Padres with him in a dynamic one-two punch to replace Jim Hendry.

American-born Miguel Angel Ponce made it 3-1 in the 59th minute, and Canada's hopes of getting back into the contest were all but ended when defender Doneil Henry received his second yellow card with 13 minutes left.
A: For me, it's casting. I think Joel is a guy you empathize with. I think there's a sadness to him. One thing I didn't want to do was make a character that you pitied. I just wanted somebody you could identify with. Vigilante movies always have it where there's a gratuitous rape, and then the guy goes out and kills the gang that rapes his family, so you can watch a rape and not feel guilty about it and then watch people get murdered and not feel guilty about it.

For years, officials acknowledge, the agency used a six-minute time frame to calculate medical emergency response times.

If you think your kids are too young for Universal Orlando, think again. Sure, the parks are known for their coasters. Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, for example, boasts the world's largest non-inverted loop -- it scared me just to look at it! The Incredible Hulk Coaster shoots you 40 mph in seconds followed by six rollovers. But there are family coasters too, including the Flight of the Hippogriff in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and standout areas like Seuss Landing where, among other things, you can eat Green Eggs and Ham and ride a couch through the pages of Dr Seuss' 'The Cat in the Hat."

A: Everyone. And they did, by beating the Thunder. This is not the NBA wild west of the '90s, with Pat Riley in New York and then in Miami. The rules are too punitive when it comes to suspensions. Besides, the Heat got to experience the joy of Perkins missing his late free throws and watching Westbrook miss shot after shot after shot.
Staffers found him a smaller room, but the quarters turned out to be too tight due to the fumes from so much glue. ("All the smells, the ladies didn't care for," Ladine said.)

Our tradition of religious freedom also points to an easy and low-cost legislative resolution of this problem: Leave the law standing but exempt conscientious objectors. This is what we did with the military draft.

The city of Cleveland also has thrown its muscle behind the project. City Council members have been reviewing a tax-increment financing deal worth $6.5 million for Sage and Optima.

Murphy alleged Renacci wrote checks from partnership accounts totaling more than $320,000 "for his own purely personal benefit and gain." Renacci countered that Murphy had diverted $850,000 in the partnership's assets.

But this poem's most poignant lines have been cut from the version that appears in the book. The uncut version, published in the journal At Length, contains rhapsodic observations: "This city of red brick suggests the subtle alienation from the sources of our strength.

On a return weekday visit, we turned toward the seafood. A large Nicoise salad featured a generously sized tuna steak cooked to order; a crab cake appetizer was crisp outside, loaded with sweet crab and dressed with a zesty lime-chipotle aioli. And there was no lack of pepper heat in a Spicy Snapper Sandwich served with crispy chips hot out of the fryer. John Q's might not be the newest or trendiest restaurant around, but it grills up a fine steak -- and that's a timeless formula for fine dining. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer
Echo Park, a blue-collar Latino neighborhood for decades, keeps getting trendier and more affluent. For more than a century, there’s been a 13-acre lake at the southwest end of the neighborhood along Glendale Boulevard — but it’s been drained for an upgrade and is likely to remain fenced off through late 2013. Fortunately, you can still cruise by the aged ladies of Carroll Avenue -- the greatest concentration of well-tended Victorian homes in Los Angeles, seven blocks south of Sunset by way of Douglas Street. And walk Sunset between Echo Park Boulevard, where a striking Ricardo Mendoza mural wraps around a clinic building, and Taix, pronounced "tex" (1911 W. Sunset Blvd.; www.taixfrench.com), the long-enduring French restaurant (and lounge with live music) where Park Avenue comes to an end. You'll find the neighborhood’s stalwart pawn shops and Mexican groceries jostled now by newcomers such as the bookshop-cafe Stories (1716 W. Sunset Blvd.; www.storiesla.com) and, farther south, the beer palace Mohawk Bend (2141 W. Sunset Blvd. www.mohawk.la), which features more than 70 local and regional brews on tap and skylit, semi-industrial dining room that once held a theater. Meanwhile, the Echo (1822 W. Sunset Blvd.; www.attheecho.com) and its downstairs sibling the Echoplex are among the city's leading venues for live rock music. El Prado (1805 W. Sunset Blvd.; www.elpradobar.com), once a dive bar, is now downright genteel (and plays mostly old vinyl on its sound system). On Saturday nights, the nonprofit Echo Park Film Center (1200 N. Alvarado St.; www.echoparkfilmcenter.org) often screens alternative and/or documentary films. But before the day gets away, you need to hit the storefront labeled Echo Park Time Travel Mart (1714 W. Sunset Blvd.; www.826la.org/store). In the rooms behind, tutors from 826LA (another nonprofit, part of a national network founded by author Dave Eggers) offer free academic help and writing workshops for students 6-18. Upfront, the outfit raises funds by selling supplies for time-travelers -- you know, like robot milk and centurion helmets. If you pretend this is normal, the clerk at the counter will too.

Kenyan runners also complicate his search for answers. It’s hard to get them to say how they prepared to run a race, and they are infamous for their monosyllabic responses at the finish line. Kenyan runners will typically say that they just ran fast or that they felt good and continued running. Yet who feels good after running for two hours or more? One certainly feels good after running for 30 minutes after work and collapsing on the sofa afterward.

Has really improved his patience and overall feel between the tackles from a year ago as well. Does a much better job picking his way through traffic, setting up blocks and than accelerating through daylight, as opposed to simply trying out sprit and run over any defender in his path. Lacks elite top end speed and isn't a guy who can simply outpace angles at the second level. However, is still a big play threat because of his ability to make defenders miss and break tackles at the second level. Is much more agile/sudden than given credit for and will catch the football out of the backfield as well. Has the frame and toughness to hold his own in blitz pick-up and is a guy who can play all three downs in the NFL.

Therefore, Moseley didn't need to select Thomas until the final rounds.

the sounds of the past and somehow strike a balance? That's one of the most important questions. I've always played acoustic music. I've never played anything else. To me, music is a language, obviously, and I've learned the language. That's what I speak. If you play jazz and pick up a horn, you're going to play jazz. That's what is going to come out.

“He’s in Hawaii right now. We’re in the cold, in the rain, in the wind because we care about America,” Romney said, speaking in the parking lot of a grocery store. “He just finished his 90th round of golf. We have 25 million Americans who are out of work, stopped looking for work or are underemployed. Home values have come down. The median income in America in the last four years has dropped by 10%.”

The standard machine is a metal tube that you slowly slide into; you have to stay very still while the image is formed.

Witch of Salem (Mayfair, $49; 2-4 players; age 12+; 60 min.) This sequel to the old cooperative game Arkham Horror - also based on the horror fantasy writing of H.P. Lovecraft - boasts splendid artwork and good thematic angles, but the game play is hard to love. Players work together (sort of - as with so many cooperative games, there's ambiguity about how much information can actually be shared) to close up interdimensional portals and keep a variety of evil spirits at bay without losing their sanity. That's harder than it looks, and only the most dedicated players are likely to soldier on through myriad defeats.

For many Latinos, the controversy is not only about the program. It's about identity — and the feeling that Arizona is trying to rein in the burgeoning social and political influence of Latinos in the state. Last year the state passed the controversial illegal immigration law SB 1070, which includes a provision that requires police to determine the immigration status of people they lawfully stop and whom they suspect to be in the country illegally. That portion of the law has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.

Granted, the program creates a perverse incentive for states to expand Medicaid in order to collect more federal matching dollars. And states need more freedom to innovate, although that doesn't require Congress to hand them a blank check. Ultimately, the challenges are the same as in the rest of the healthcare system: A small percentage of the beneficiaries rack up most of the bills. That means states must continue to search for ways to deliver care more efficiently, and to save money through higher quality, better coordinated care. Those are the goals of the Affordable Care Act, which is part of the solution, not the problem.

It won't just be memories that draw fans to HP Pavilion on Tuesday, when Springsteen and the E Street Band's Wrecking Ball tour makes its Bay Area stop. It will also be the chance to hear an artist who still makes incredibly relevant and powerful music.
