After Woolf, we are given D.H Lawrence's The Horsedealer's Daughter. I have always liked Lawrence, even though I recognise he was maddening and fairly bonkers. This story is also fairly bonkers, with the usual Lawrentian love of PASSION over mere emotions. The editor of the book has placed it cleverly in the collection - after the pale, (mildly insipid?), Woolf piece, this comes across like an ungenteel howl.
I planned to hang it on a mirror in my entry way. I always wondered how people did this without putting an extra hole in the wall. I folded the ribbon over the top of the mirror and used painters tape on the back to hold it in place. Its working pretty well - the wreath is still in place!

Perhaps if there were more books with people of color, there would be a higher demand. As it were, the YA section of the bookstore looks like the same girl in different Emo poses. Young girls of color are left feeling inadequate for being different and striving toward a goal that they could never achieve nor should they want to. Teen girls are the most impressionable people on the planet, and are FAMOUS for inserting themselves inside of a story. Reading about a hot, mysterious guy who falls madly in love with a flawless girl who looks nothing like you does wonders for a girl’s self-esteem.

Yesterdays MacMillan coffee morning at the garden center was a little disappointing, I only sold 2 Martha Stewart punches, so will instead make another personal donation to the charity. Will also be running a blog candy on my Jazzlins Designs Blog soon for this charity. Please be sure to join in, by keeping an eye out here.
Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables from the “dirty dozen” list would mean you’d get an average of 14 different pesticides. By choosing five from the clean list, you’d consumer fewer than two pesticides.
Sadly this was a short lived affair, we turned up 5 minutes before they were closing (which to be honest was something like 07:25pm!) so we didnt really get to take much in. There was also a rabble of 'boystrous' children clambering everywhere when we got in there too so we dashed in, grabbed our goodies and went with haste! Again, it was small in here and not much room, but it still looked so inviting in there. We got 4 little cupcakes :)

The drinks are a good deal, but that for me is not what pulls me in to Happy Hour time after time - it's the amazing small plates and gourmet pizzas at just $6-$9 each (all but the cheese plate, which is $12 for eight cheeses). Here are a few of the dishes that, at mere thought, have a Pavlovian effect on me.
It still has to go through a process before any work is undertaken, but we are very happy with the direction!

At the last minute, though, a TV show to which Kate was already committed switched its recording days so she now has to be in London on the Wednesday/Thursday (and possibly also the Tuesday). She can’t do her two Malcolm Hardee Debate shows and can’t switch her two dates with mine.

My 10 year old nephew was badly shaken. As his parents hustled him from the grounds to our vehicle, he turned his head, peering beneath their arms to look back in the direction the man had run. Later, Carney and Patrolman Eddie Van Zandt took time to reassure and comfort him, a gesture that proved more helpful than the words of parents or an uncle. Two more detectives arrived, and Carney had to leave to get to Juvenile Court where he had been headed when he responded to the call.
About the Olympic Mountains west of the Hood Canal, and even Mt. Rainer on this side of the big Hood Canal, yes, they are far away, but are so huge that on a clear day they look like they are just a few miles away and not over 100 miles away. There hardly is any snow on the Olympics, and it has started to snow on the Cascade Range that divide this state, but not like before and not like our Eastern states. However, the winter is very cold, in the 20s and 30s farenheit most days now.

So as I said, I'm going away for Christmas in the morning, with 13 members of family and another 4 family friends so I have a feeling it's going to be a bit manic! This is our fourth time at the Manor hotel though, and it is seriously amazing, with something for everyone from my 79 year old grandmother to my cousin's little boy! I'm not feeling very festive at all really but am looking forward to seeing lots of my favourite people and having a great time. I won't be properly blogging now until about the 29th but when I do I will be showing you lots of photos so you can have that to look forward to ;)

This recipe comes from the newly released book Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams at Home, by Jeni Britton Bauer, owner of Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams in Ohio. (Don’t miss the video currently on the website. Fun stuff.) I’ve made only one recipe from the book, admittedly, but I tasted a second one that Matthew made - we ate it for dessert after our most recent podcast taping - and I think it’s fair to say that Jeni’s flavors are exceptional. But what’s even more exceptional is that, after making only one recipe, I came away feeling that I had learned a lot. I like that in a cookbook. Jeni’s approach is very scientific, which feels fitting, because ice cream is, after all, a frozen emulsion. A good homemade ice cream can be tricky to make, and the results are often icy or crumbly, or leave a slick of greasy fat on the spoon. You know what I mean. Jeni’s ice creams are made without eggs, and she explains her choice of ingredients in admirable depth, a real thrill for us aging science majors. I LOVE SCIENCE!

This episode, however, will not be complete without including and discussing our heroes – the brave Filipinos who fought and died for freedom and independence or against oppression – from Lapu-Lapu, to Jose Rizal, to Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino – all national heroes and pride of the Philippines.
I really wasn't satisfied with this result. I always have some of this Rustoleum metallic gold spray paint on hand. You never know when you're gonna need to make something gold right? No but seriously, it's got a great sparkle to it. Since I wasn't happy with the Martha gold I figured I'd spray it and see what happened.
The library offers so many wonderful mind jogging opportunities. If I ever get stuck with an empty brain I am right there. One books leads to another and a million new questions spread and grow. It is lovely.
Now look at how the church responded, they tarry in Jerusalem waiting for the promise of the Father. In Matthew 3:11, the prophet John said, “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. The resurrected Jesus echoes what John said, “And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. (Acts 1:4, 5 KJV) In Acts chapter 2 the church is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire. When a fire is set it automatically begins to spread, the church is on fire!
Before and after playing, Sumbody took time to mingle with the crowd/fans and that is something we hardly ever see when attending events of big shot artists. During a chat with the guy himself, he mentioned that “In this business, never be BIG HEADED, after all you can never be larger than your supporters, they are the reason you are who you are!!!!!!”
A delicate cheese needs a delicate cracker. And that is why I suggest Carr’s Table Water Crackers. They have a nice consistency. They won’t break under the pressure of a knife unless the cheese is atypically stiff. They are a nice size, perfect for two or three bites, unless you have a big appetite, or a big mouth. They are a perfect cracker for brie.

Pets offer individuals numerous health benefits. Imagine listening to your favorite type of music with your canine kid right next to you at a favorite restaurant or park. At many restaurants with patios, canine kids are served a bowl of water upon arriving. While shopping at farmers markets on the weekends you might notice individuals with their ferrets or cats in pet carriers. A few of these pet lovers are co-authors in my book, Stories of Multiple Pets – Austin, Texas.

Suddenly there is a loud screech and a commotion behind us, and a volunteer legs it over to separate the otter from a woolly monkey. Being a baby, he loves to play fight, but his games aren’t always appreciated by the perceptive primates.
Well, yes … yes, I did. One day, I was making a mixed drink on the beach, and realized I didn’t have a knife to cut my lime. Well, a lime is a citrus, like an orange, right? So I figured it wouldn’t hurt to peel a lime, like you would an orange.
Everybody seems to be talking about them lately… Although I'm just a newbie, I don't remember having ever seen so much media exposure around this machines.

I mean... How often do you need a rice cooker or egg cooker? It doesn't HAVE to be on the kitchen counter all the time, so it gets relegated to the laundry room counter and then gets a winter coat or old book bag tossed on top. That's how we roll...
Here’s how State works. You go in a room with one judge and a couple of people watching. You perform your piece, and then the judge has a private chat with you to give you some critiques. You then leave the room, and frantically check the score-boards every 13.45 seconds to see if your name and place rank are listed yet. The best score you can get at State is a 1, and generally people who go to State get 1′s and 2′s. Rarely have I see a 3.
I do this at home in my bathroom, with a box of L'Oreal bought at Walmart. This process takes a good 45 minutes out of my weekend, a process that I certainly did not enjoy.

Thanks to the high volume of traffic these past few days my blog was blocked by the anti-spam machine for a little while there, thank you to The PM for the email alerting me to it. My drive home was like some kind of flash: one minute I was reading the email the next I was bursting through the door to grab my laptop. However I faced a conundrum when I remembered just how urgently I needed the bathroom. So, like all girls, I go in there with my phone to discover my bladder has apparently expanded to hold all the liquid in the world and have the longest pee ever when I get another email with the actual message of what was displayed on the site. I then proceeded to trip over my pants in my rush to pull them up and run at the same time to get to the sink to wash my hands and back to my laptop.

Canada's decision to grant him refugee status because of his colour prompted accusations of racism from the South African government and a fresh bout of soul searching in a country still scarred by the legacy of apartheid. Some South African whites say they have become a persecuted minority.
I scored these while they were still warm, which was good because they crisped up as they cooled. The H and I each had some while they were warm and the underside was slightly chewy. I'm impressed with how well they held together and plan to make them again. I really like the toastiness of the browned edges. The H has already requested a version with chocolate drizzled over the top. :)

** Indiana Downs "selection of tarts" This doesn't do it justice. We weren't able to sample everything they offered because they were changing it up every hour. What we had was delicious but I don't know what it was. Something with a goat cheese consistency and taste on top, a fruit compote of some sort, and they used edible flowers as well. Yummy and intriguing.
Well, first I slept in. Which was AWESOME.
Next week on Tuesday, Feb. 7, don’t miss all-new episodes of GLEE, NEW GIRL and RAISING HOPE. On GLEE (8:00-9:00 PM ET/PT), Will (Matthew Morrison) gives the glee club a Spanish singing assignment, and enlists the help of his musically-inclined night school teacher (guest star Ricky Martin). Then, on NEW GIRL (9:00-9:31 PM ET/PT), Jess (Zooey Deschanel) makes it her mission to get the loft’s cantankerous landlord (guest star Jeff Kober, “Sons of Anarchy”) to like her, and inadvertently jeopardizes her and her roommates’ living situation. Finally, Burt (Garret Dillahunt) gets buried in finances during corporate tax season, and Virginia (Martha Plimpton) seeks a new business venture as a tarot card reader on RAISING HOPE (9:31-10:00 PM ET/PT).
Con Dao is another fishing paradise, and the food we had is good proof of that. At Try Ky, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant on the island--and I say this literally, because they were renovating the place at the same time--you pick your fish before eating it. We had squid grilled with Vietnamese satay, which was perfectly cooked and not too rubbery, as squid can unfortunately get. Vietnamese satay is pretty spicy, and although we got strange looks when we asked for a side of rice, I'll admit it was more than welcome.
To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree has its voice as well as its feature. At the passing of the breeze the fir-trees sob and moan no less distinctly than they rock; the holly whistles as it battles with itself; the ash hisses amid its quiverings; the beech rustles while its flat boughs rise and fall.
I felt his fingers slide inside me, twisting, scooping around, seeking out the buttons that would turn me to jelly. At that moment I went down on him hard, sucking him deep into my mouth and throat, my tongue sliding around his shaft. Tasting him. Breathing him. My fingers were working around his balls and the base of his cock and I detected a shudder just before he came… I was no longer aware of exactly what he was doing to me, I only felt waves of pleasure radiating from deep within me out to my arms and legs, pulsating across my belly, filling my breasts with tingly heat, rippling up through my shoulders and neck to my head… Even my hair felt energised.

In 2002, Democratic Reps. Jim McDermott of Washington, David Bonior of Michigan and Mike Thompson of California, took a special trip to Iraq at the behest of Saddam Hussein, knowing full well that our invasion was imminent, and that their actions were an attempt to undermine the United States . Not one of them was charged.
This home (at 301 N. Fourth St. in Marquette) belonged to Hampson Gregory, a local architect and builder whom The Mining Journal said was the man more than any other who was responsible for building Marquette. Gregory was born in Devonshire, England in 1834. He and his family migrated to Canada and then arrived in Marquette in 1867. He frequently worked with sandstone, and many of his buildings reflect the style of English architecture common in his native Devonshire and neighboring Cornwall, England.
The black paint on the edges of the striker units can and will rub off onto the figures legs, this I learned the hard way, and trying to run it off only made the area shiny, which didn't look very good on the mate paint finish.

I wish I could put all my thoughts and emotions on a neat chart which would tell me why TTWD is both so effective and so hard, what's going on in my mind during those angry moments and what it really is that needs to leech out of my system. It's all good, I just wish I understood it better.

I was interested in seeing how the thing would work. Would the actors speak at the same time as the music or in-between? Would it be like melodrama? In fact, a wide variety of things happened, including the piano being used as a prop in many different ways and a trill in Schubert’s D960 sonata representing the memory of a doorbell.

Then, I select my buttons (I generally use matching buttons on each envelope, but it is not necessary) and my embroidery floss. Sew your button into place as marked on the pattern. If you have small grommets, you can use card stock circles and grommet them into place, but again, not necessary. I try to buy special equipment as rarely as possible. When sewing your button onto the top flap you will want to sew it securely, tie it off and then rather than clip your remaining thread, sew back through to the outside of your envelope and tie a knot around the base of your button, then leave the remaining string so you can fasten your envelope shut.

You are dying for a beer, glass of wine, or heck, at this point you'd settle for a big swig of mouthwash or cough syrup to get a small taste of alcohol. Your food aversions to chicken or any other white meat are becoming a serious issue for planning healthy meals for the rest of your family and your cravings for sweets and junk aren't helping the household diet either. You've got a summer to look forward to without bathing suits or trips to the beach or lake. It will likely be excruciatingly hot when you are VERY pregnant and still excrutiatingly hot when you have a newborn lovebug snuggled sleepily on you all day long. Mason's kicks are becoming more intense and are sometimes downright uncomfortable and I anticipate some of the jabs I'm now experiencing in my ribs will in the next weeks become simply painful.
'It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid'!
The response to my guest blog over at Simply Solo (In Defense of the Beta Man) along with some things I read on a couple blogs recently got me thinking about “The Friend Zone.” You know, that place men talk about hating being put by the women in their lives, like it’s some dread purgatory from which there is no escape.
I don't know why I let it slide in the first place. Once upon a time, back when I was married to Sidekick, soccer was a major priority. I would go down to the field even when it was pouring with rain, just to see if anyone would be crazy enough, like me, to want to train! It was my escape. My shield. My way of coping with the fact (even before I ever knew it) that I didn't feel comfortable in my own house. That I didn't want to be at home.
By the way, I decided to title this post as “May” because I didn’t want to sit here thinking of a better title. I get lazy like that sometimes. That’s about it for this post.
And as usual the oval in Fayetteville yielded some nice marks at the Razorback Invitational. Among the highlights in Arkansas we got Brittany Reese out to 21' .25" in the long jump; April Steiner over 14' 5.25" early season in the pole vault; Walter Davis jumping well with a 55' 9" triple jump; Mike Rodgers winning the consolation heat of the 60 in 6.63 and Alabama Sr Ray Jadusingh winning the open race in 6.62; and Jerome Miller (6.66) over World champion Ryan Brathwaite (6.68) in the 60 hurdles.

Isaiah is shaken to his core; “Woe is me, for I am undone!” He is a broken man in the presence of God. This is not a destructive brokenness, however, God is wearing Isaiah down in order to put him back together…Stronger…purer…. Holy.
I think that last bit is important, and key to why I feel comfortable walking into new stores now--rather than hyperventilating and going beet red like before. To some extent, recognizing the purpose of a SA is the key to comfort. I adopt that wonderful French practice: I greet somebody when I enter. This tells the SA that I know s/he is there so they can go about their duties. Second, when approached, I explain my purpose. If it's to be fitted, I say so--if it's to look around, I say that too. My goal is to express my purchase intent (from on the horizon to right now) while being open to new ideas. When I leave, I thank someone, even if no one specific helped me.

Numerous authors have commented that in times of dislocation the ability to move goods from where they are made to where they are needed is often a path to riches. Transportation is obviously the key. If we are assuming that fuel is hard to obtain, then having a viable form of transportation may mean that going on the road is a valid lifestyle choice. The Gypsy lifestyle or the life of a travelling tinker may be a future possibility.
We live, suggests Buddhism, in an utterly interconnected co-emergent universe, where everything is in a state of co-arising all the time. (This co-arising also includes dissolution, but in Buddhism these are not polar opposites.)
dg Arts was a re-branded incarnation of the DGAA (Dumfries and Galloway Arts Association.) The DGAA had to be bailed out using council funds after serious overspending that threatened it’s existing.

Dale Sveum will just be the next in line to try and put the Cubs back on top, but with a roster like the Cubs have now, I don’t see it happenning in 2012 or even 2013. The Only hope for this ballclub is not in their manager, but their brand new General Manager, Theo Epstein. The problem is that the media sees a team doing poorly and they blame it on the skipper. Sveum will be under a lot of fire if the Cubs don’t excel quickly, and I don’t see that happenning.
I really actually do have an enormous urge to just walk away from my blog. What stops me? You! yes all of my friends in blogland who I would miss, and wonder how you are all getting on. And would I change my mind when life becomes more settled again, and my little sun shines again. After all if my little sun comes out again I will be all chirpy and full of energy.

We checked the weather forecast which showed no nighttime temperatures below freezing in the coming week and a couple of days of rain – indicating a perfect time for planting! The GeoKids pitched right in, and about 2 1/2 hours later we had almost all the plants in their allocated spots, with a few held back to plant later in the week once we had their companion plants on hand. Since our “black gold” soil is fresh, we put some diluted root fertilizer in each hole to give the plants a good start.
Today I had the wonderful experience of speaking to a group of adults and demonstrating how to teach a song to children. We learned "Once There was a Snowman" actions and all. It was very fun. Everyone said they felt like they were kids again. I hadn't thought of it, but I feel like a kid every week at church when I'm with the Primary kids. Besides, it is so cold outside, if we had any chance of moisture it would definitely be snow.
McLaren’s comment is “I don’t know which shocks you (i.e., the reader) more – that I would question God’s violence, or that Pete would defend it.” Here is the first of his false dilemmas. As I read Pete’s comments I did not see him “defending” God’s violence, simply stating its factuality which, it seems, McLaren denies.
The headlines were sober; they did not scream at you nor offend your sensibilities. The writing was clean, crisp and lucid. The editorials were magisterial; thoughtfully and closely argued, they provided insight and leadership on a wide range of issues, national and foreign.

TRUE UNITY is achieved in the blending of energies, it is the acknowledging of others whilst staying TRUE to YOU. At SOUL level this is accepted and adhered to at all times but the human race is now moving into aligning with SOUL, this will take time and it will take work for the smoke and mirrors are thick within the human race in many areas. Those who sought to contain and control placing deep teachings to bury TRUTH in plain view. Many are still aligning with these teachings and we ask you humbly to become the observer and to dissolve those which are visible to YOU.

So the lure of a sunrise Easter service on the beach was strong. I was rewarded with awe: at moonlight on the ocean waves, the silent constellations and the mumur of pre-caffeinated families stumbling along the water’s edge on the way there. Then, during the service, palmtrees silhouetted by pastel dawn, gulls and pelicans swooping and calling above us, the cold of the silken sand beneath me. And on the way home, red and clear jellyfish glittering like ornaments, and a remora washed up–his eye primeval, his chin-sucker a baroque pattern. Life is complex, wondrous, renewing. If you want to call it God, that’s fine with me.

Another wise friend of mine had advised me some weeks ago forgo tilting at windmills, and she was spot on in that advice. This is a time now that I should let go, back up, and leave the windmills to their own devices. I am only one man. I have only one voice. That voice cannot sustain infinite conversation and fruitless dissipation. that way lies weariness and stress. It behooves me to temper myself, my leaps into the din and clatter.

Now i know these images are weird but besides giant businessmen jumping and flying over city skylines, there’s one other type of stock photo that i just do not get, The fruit on your face photos, we’ve all seen them at least once.

Rest assure that self-doubt is a common thought that lingers in the back of my head daily...but then I think about how I am not the only one trying to make it through each day.
Students helped by a dedicated teacher are the Committee members, volunteers and organizers. That evening, about 80 of them were the ticket vendors, waiters, bus boys, etc. They were without adult supervision since the school board has cut the job of the person supervising after school activities. Everything went very smoothly and we enjoyed very good spaghetti and a splendid evening.

Okay, g2g, time to watch my favorite movie of all time now.
which is right now) :( I am going to be so starving by 3:30. Why in the world would they schedule it that late in the day??????? Ugh I just want to get this over with. My rant is done now... Just had to get that out. Depending on how I am feeling, I will try to get a post up by Sunday or Monday. Talk to you all in a few days.
In my opinion, the perfect match for side dish is mashed potatoes and some salad or pickles. For the mashed potatoes, you can use 6-7 boiled Yukon gold potatoes, 2-3 tsp of butter, 2-3 tbsp of sour cream and add milk while mixing with a mixer until the desire consistency is reached (I used 1/2 cup). I know, I know! Millions of calories! But it’s so goooood!

When I woke up this morning, it was a regular type of day. Getting the kids ready, getting myself ready for work, dropping kids off, planning the rest of the day. Little did I know that God had big things in store for my 41st birthday. For the last 18 months I have been working on making myself stronger. My physical body ready to battle through middle age. This year, I vowed to work on my spiritual side. To keep strong in mind and body. And to let God guide my feet. Not an easy task for a Type A person who wants to be in control. Not easy at all!

Cathy and I picked this one out purely based on it's label. We really enjoyed the red wagon, carrying the beer bottles. I never did this growing up, but I know everyone has seen the kid with his red Flyer wagon corralling up used bottles and cans to take bake to the corner store. Very cool.

Take comfort - you are not alone, and now Cookbook Sundays is your opportunity to change that. Every Sunday I'm going to share with you a recipe that I haven't made before from one of my ever expanding collection of cookbooks. And, because I know that if you have read this far then you are guilty of this too, I'm inviting you to join in with me. Each week my Cookbook Sundays post will have a linky for you to share something you've cooked from one of your cookbooks.
Well, today I am back with some very exciting news! While I was at Big Sky, I got an email invitation to be on the StopAndScrap.com design team! I have been shopping with StopAndScrap.com for sometime now, and so I was very excited to be asked!! They have a tremendous and loyal scrapbooking clientele, and now want to make sure that they are carrying and marketing to all paper crafters...especially cardmakers & stampers! We'd love to have you join in on the excitement and new direction that the store is taking while still providing you with the best product and prices of your favorite manufacturers. We're going to be making some tremendous and positive changes for our valued customer, so that StopAndScrap will be the only store you shop at and have a lot of fun while you're doing it!
She was slightly older than middle-aged and had been attacked with machetes, her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated. Her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. I could do little more for her at that moment than stop the bleeding with a few sutures. We were completely overwhelmed. She knew and I knew that there were so many others. She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, “Allez, allez. Ummera, ummera-sha”—‘Go, go. Courage, courage, my friend—find your courage and let it live.’
I really love my family and friends...I'm such a lucky lady to enjoy more than just one day of celebration for my birthday. Two weeks ago a good friend emailed me and said it was my turn to be treated to lunch this time especially since my birthday was coming up so I should pick a day, time, and place! We went to my new favorite cafe and had a great time chatting and eating; we were there for two hours and it probably only took 30 minutes to eat! After my friend told the waitress it was my birthday they told us we could stay as long as we wanted!

First of all, I used Post it Notes to create stripes on the bottom half of the background, masking areas, and inking inbetween those areas. I dried everything thoroughly, and then I went back and masked everything again, and inked the white areas inbetween with one of the large lace stamps with Spun Sugar Distress Ink. For the top half of the card, I simply coloured the background with Spun Sugar Distress Ink, then stamped the large lace flower with Paris Dusk Memento Ink. I put a piece of dark blue ribbon across the middle. This is from one of the ribbon sets that Glenda sells on the website.
(CNS Business): The developers of Morritt’s Tortuga Club and Morritt’s Grand Resort have announced a major expansion of the East End timeshare and resort with an anticipated investment of some CI $58 million over the next 5 to 10 years, with construction starting on the first phase no later than June of this year. Morritt Properties said in a release yesterday that the two existing resorts have consistent levels of high occupancy, often over 80% year round, and over 12,000 owners worldwide. With the new developments, the goal is to double their timeshare ownership in the next 10 years to 30,000+ club members. “I’m so excited about the future,” said David Morritt, owner and developer of the Morritts resorts.

Am I the only one who can hardly believe it is almost the middle of January already? How did that happen? And where did the weekend go? Oh yes, I spent it reading! It was a reserve weekend which I jokingly refer to as Wednesday. You see my husband is an active duty reservist. I know, who knew there was such a thing, right? Well he has been on active duty in the reserves for the past 7 years. What does this have to do with his reserve weekend being a Wednesday? Well, you see when he has a reserve weekend he works a 12 day "week". And when Monday rolls around we know there are only 4 more days before he has a normal 2 day weekend. So Sat/Sun/Mon is our "Wednesday" aka middle of the "week". And typically not a lot gets done over the reserve weekend! Henceforth my weekend of reading. and laundry but that's a given.
I think I mentioned this before, but I'm somewhat of a celebrity at my doctor's office. Apparently, its pretty rare to show up to the hospital with the baby nearly falling out of your girly bits, but that's exactly how things went with my firstborn. I had planned to have an epidural and everything. I figured, why be in pain? I wouldn't have my appendix removed without some sort of pain killer...why remove a baby in agony? However, my plan to be all happy and giggles during delivery didn't work out quite that way. But to be honest, I was glad to go au natural. I even told my husband afterward that I enjoyed labor and delivery, pain and all. I know it sounds like I'm completely mental, but unless its experienced, one can never understand the miracle of giving birth. And I don't use miracle lightly. The whole thing is just absolutely mind blowing. So, the second time around, I informed the doctor that I didn't want to have an epidural. I told them that if things went as smoothly as the first time, I preferred to deliver my child at warp speed and in total torture. They already believed me to be completely crazy so it didn't phase them one bit. They merely said "One baby, massive misery, pure pain, you got it."

What I found really annoying about this book, is that this lady, Flanagan, wrote this book as a commentary (and I appreciate social commentary, really, I do - I love this stuff. Sometimes I wish that I had done something more like that then what I currently do for work), but her research was abysmal. She honestly read dozens and dozens of copies of 17, The Diary of Anne Frank, a couple of other biographies and not much else. Her research was flimsy at best - nothing to be proud of and certainly nothing to base these general and sweeping analysis of girlhood culture on. If she were going to read anything, she should have read the blogs that the girls that she was claiming to study wrote. She should have asked them for their diaries. Hell, she should have asked me for MY diaries from the ages of 13-19 because I would have candidly turned them over and talked to her about them. Maybe even talked to the girls that she was claiming to know so much about, because I'm sure that first person accounts and interviews would have given her the insight that she needed to write a much more candid, thoughtful and insightful account of what girls go through in this day and age in maturing sexually, emotionally, physically and mentally into adult, American women. But she didn't do that and, as a result, her book is shallow and out of touch, in spite of moments of smartness. In fact, the moments of brilliance almost make it worse because, in showing me those moments, I become aware that she is, in fact, capable of doing things in a much better fashion then she did with this book.

The characters were just brilliant. Basically you have five main characters. Zoe Morgan is the MAIN main character. But then there is also Gavin, Scarlet,Yileen, and to a lesser extent, Sinnder. He may not be in the book as much, but he makes a HUGE impact on the scenes he was in. So let's talk. Zoe was awesome. She's a fighter with a bad-ass attitude. She doesn't take lip from anybody and she totally stands up for what she believes in. She loves whales. It's more than love. It's passion. An obsession. And then there's Gavin. Total hottie rockstar with a protective streak. But he's also sensitive and Australian. Oh yes. Australian. With black spiky hair, tattoos, and a lip ring. He's a sentinel, and has been assigned to protect Zoe. They meet in Zoe's dreams and they get to know each other. Very well. Yileen was Gavin's mentor. He was also just a really great character. I loved that he had his own dialect, and he just felt very different from any other character in the book. He also had some really great lines. Then there's Scarlet. I don't think I am giving you any spoilers by telling you that she's the villain. She's also a redhead with a bitch attitude, and she wants Gavin. Badly. Finally, Sinnder. I don't know what the heck was going on with Sinnder, but I want more. Lots more. He was sooo hot. I suppose that Sinnder could make women drop their panties with just a look if he wanted to. Ha. He and Scarlet are Fire Elementals, and Fire Elementals are all about desires and human instincts. Therefore, they tend to be violent. And they like to have sex. Lots of sex. Maybe you can get the gist of why I like Sinnder so much. :)

It was my job to read Lucien's favorite dinosaur book to the class while the teacher set cookies and juice on all the desks. When I first sat down in front of all those bright blinkie eyes with my book, I felt icy cold fear. Kids are very good bullshit detectors. Would they know I didn't know what the hell I was doing? That I'd never entertained a large group of children before? Could they sense my fear? Would they turn on me like angry chimps? (The answer is no but it looked iffy for a second when little Miles raised a suspicious eyebrow.)
I want to talk about something which has come up again as a result of Baz Kirby noting on the Gloucester Boards that he had ‘got Analytics installed on Gloucester Labour website’. That led me to look at GL’s site, which led me to look at The Team, which led me to note again that Harjit Gill is listed as living at 155 Barton Street, contrary to the opinion of others. They are quite correct because, on the city council’s website, his address is listed as Tithe Farm, Tithe Farm Lane, Birdwood, way out past Churcham on the A40.

Second episode was in 2007, when my husband and I had a “discussion” where I said the word divorce and in the blink of an eye, my life an unforeseen tour. I was, again, a single parent. Only this time I had a total of three children. Left with no home, no financial security and emotionally, no support. Once again prescriptions enabled me to push thru my emotions and provide for my family. This too will be put in more detail in the future.
The film starts off with Michael Caine’s character realizing that he’s in love with his wife’s sister. It goes on to explore the complex relationships of the members of that family, and there’s a lot of talk about love, family, God, and death (obviously, it’s Woody Allen we’re talking about here). The relationships are portrayed particularly well, especially between the three sisters. And man, there are some great lines. Three-way tie for favorite are

However I miss the fun: the buzz of a crowded shop on the last Saturday before Christmas, meeting old friends at drunken book launches and having a good bitch with the publishers' sales reps. I don't think there's much fun in the book trade any more, so perhaps I was lucky to get out while I did.

1. The progress of science has shown that the simplest living organism contains huge amounts of biological information, similar to the Java code I write all day at work. This is a problem for atheists, because the sequence of instructions in a living system has to come together all at once, it cannot have evolved by mutation and selection – because there was no replication in place prior to the formation of that first living system!

Oooo, that is crossing the line. I understand if you are friends with your ex, and you made amends and all. But when you constantly tell me “I never want to see their faces again. I just want to live my life.” Then by all means i can get enraged when you want to “hang out” with them. Oh the coolest part is coming up. My boyfriend’s friend had told me that “They arent going to exchange their things cause the last ex didnt show up. I know that his ex and his friend left last night too.”
Keith and I had been called by commissioner Brown about 36 months ago. We had had previous dealing with the commissioner in the past, helping to solve a few low key cases that the local boys in blue had struggled with. So Brown was no stranger to our door step.

I thought live chickens were just about the sweetest thing ever, with their fluffy feathers and cute little beaks and the funny way they moved their heads around. Fascinating little creatures.

Monks and priests continued what Patricus Magnus began, and another invader came bearing the hammer of Thor. Shortly after the Vikings settled and intermarried with the people of the green, the English came knocking. Invited over by a displaced king, Dermot of Leinster, England now had its excuse to invade Eireann. Ever after Eireann would be known as Ireland and people would forget Eru, the goddess the land was named after, slowly disregarding the magic once so much a part of Irish society. Many would forget or simply stop believing in the early gods and goddesses while one god, a foreign god, reigned supreme. The English, greedy as ever, would, in time, spread across the island, staking claim on house and land.
El Salvador’s executive office is not the only branch of government demonstrating some real autonomy of late. As evidenced by its decision to do away with the PDC and PCN parties – against objections from the AL – the judiciary has shown a real independent streak as well.
The conservative community in Norway have been vigorously harassed in the MSM since the attacks for having ‘emotionally’ contributed to the Oslo attacks, despite the fact that they have never encouraged or condoned such measures. The conservative community have in fact strongly condemned it and never attempted to make any excuses or find any mitigating circumstances that could be construed as indirect support for the terrorist. But still they have been harangued for it in the MSM. Mr. Sevje on the other hand, who in this interview makes a distinction between Israeli and Norwegian terrorist victims are given the all clear by the Norwegian MSM, and the episode is allowed to pass ‘unnoticed’ in the Norwegian press.

-Hillary Clinton is unelectable. If the Democrats wish to re-take the White House they must find someone who can win in the Republican strongholds, like Evan Bayh. I must say though, even being from Indiana, there is something about Bayh that makes me question whether he’s actually presidential material. But he is a Democrat who can win in normally Republican country. Unlike John Edwards, who had zero influence even in his own home state (as was also the case with Al Gore), Bayh would likely take Indiana and swing Ohio over to the Democrats, which would almost assuredly win the race.

Another free way to get a U.S. IP address is by using free Tor. Tor is a system intended to enable online anonymity, composed of client software and a network of servers which can hide information about users’ locations and other factors which might identify them. This method is more difficult to set up, because you need to set it up with US “exit nodes” only. Besides someone else from the Tor network can potentially do something unlawful using you as an exit node, so Tor is pretty risky.

Which issues are being mixed and where ? A clear case of playing with peoples emotions by projecting the messages in a stratigized campaign to fool people into believing what it shows,a documentraish branding, patronising our history and poverty.It is an aggressive attempt at classical conditioning from a company whose brand recognition has been closely connected to its questionable practices in precisely the kind of tribal areas where this ad claims it is ‘creating happiness’ and just look at the selected jury, Gul Panag and Shyam Benegal, the socially conscious celebrities in the world of cinema, who were actually kept in dark, that its a VEDANTA PR EXCERCISE There is something called professional ethics, I hope Mr Pandey knows that very well, so act of keeping jury in dark was totally unethical . The Films in creating happiness are produced by Vedanta , funded by vedanta, and telling people what great work they are doing, Its like judging own production , and using the filmakers to say what vedanta officials wanted to say, but could not as no onE would have then believd them obviously .

God has commanded all who know Him to preach the word and make disciples from all parts of the world. Therefore, we know that it is through the preaching of the word that men hear and believe. From this we understand that the Holy Spirit works through this preaching of the Gospel to draw men unto salvation. Shouldn’t we be obeying this command?

The trouble I had combining this system with theAbysmal, was that in order for the the tzolkin and theAbysmal 365-day calendar to synchronize, the tzolkin would have to skip the leap year day (or else theAbysmal would simply do away with inserting a leap year day, in which case, it would function much as the Haab). The Maya calendars don’t insert leap year days (as far as I’m aware), they count every day and drift out of phase with the seasons.However, as a perpetual calendar aligned with the seasons, theAbysmal wouldn’t work well without the Leap Year. Which means that the 260-days would have to synchronize with the 365-days of theAbysmal, skip the leap year day (which would in turn be counted on the lunar calendar). This would fundamentally change the function of the 260-day calendar, so I wouldn’t want to call it the tzolkin (which is just a later name applied by Mayanists), but invent a new name for it. In honour of the 1980s video game, and the “mayan vs aliens” tin-hat patrol, I might just name it the space invaders calendar.
I have notices how much I feel protected by my weight though.

We need to have in our minds firmly planted and exercised regularly, a vision of that day, it has to loom large in our mind and in our heart; otherwise there’s no prize before us. We have to have the prize set before us, and that is enjoying heaven with all its delights in the presence of God forever, without pain or sorrow or grief. The fight will be over. And so we do need to think of that day often.

“Trot, please, all trot,” the announcer commanded. Another gust of wind rustled Peaches’ mane. Suddenly, I found myself flipping through the air. The ground rose up quickly to meet my helmet. As I rolled like a car off a bridge, I could see Peaches bucking her way the rope fence. The birds and stars still circled my head while she spooked the other two horses in the ring with all her kicking. As she rounded the final turn, she farted loudly, skidded through the opening in the rope, and galloped back across the field to her barn.

Of course, some people may find the idea of a vehicle called a C**kmobil rather rude, but in those days decency ruled; now brands think themselves clever if they call themselves something rude - like FCUK, or CNUT, or Twat clothing brands, and even a designer called Eva Minge; I can hardly bear to write those words. And then there is that silly woman, Susan Garden, Baroness Garden of Frognal, who has had to ask newspapers to stop referring to her as Lady Garden. She should have ensured she married someone with a more sensible name - it's called grooming.

Phew! Just putting it down into those words makes me realize how utterly mesmerizing “Androzani” really is, and how I’ve perhaps grown accustomed to taking it for granted over the years. It's the final story of the Peter Davison era, and it’s hard to see this particular tale being anything but a regeneration story. Indeed, it is the ultimate regeneration story, and it’s probably influenced every regeneration story since. Death is written on every wall from as early as the first episode, and a sense of thrilling dread lurks around every corner. And it makes perfect sense that the Fifth Doctor - on whose watch Adric was killed - would go to the ends of the Earth (or in this case the universe) to make damned sure he doesn’t lose another companion.
Meanwhile the Publicity Group were hard at work coming up with a name for the band (they decided on “The Equals”) and then designing T-Shirts. The three bloggers took photos of the proceedings and wrote their first post on the Posterous site (which can be seen here – please note this may become password protected at a later date). Throughout the morning pairs of students also tried out the Nintendo Wii, learning to play instruments on Wii Music.

Fellow blogger, interior designer, author, artist, fabric designer – Jackie Von Tobel is a whirlwind. How she has time to do it all amazes me. Two years ago she wrote and illustrated Window Treatments, a sort of drapery bible (available HERE) – but Jackie is not one to sit around and twiddle her thumbs. Even before Window Treatments was published, Jackie was already thinking ahead to her next book:

What better way to spend a cold afternoon, than letting your progeny throw a very heavy ball at some tiny pins that seem to be permanently glued down? Okay, I can think of a few other things, but they would all involve palm trees and margaritas, besides, the kids are really excited. Truth be told, I recently attended a grown up bowling party for a friend's birthday and despite my dismal score, I had a really good time.
These are simple tips that will keep your sharpener in good shape and keep your face healthy too.
Watching the first two episodes of the new HBO series “Girls,” I chuckled, cringed and laughed out loud. That was when 24-year-old Hannah announced to her parents that she believed she was “the voice of her generation,” or at least “a voice,” and needed $1100 a month for the next two years to finish her collection of essays. Her mother sputtered, “That’s ridiculous!”

My guess, however, is that my greatest style influence has not been any of these experiences, as helpful and as formative as they have been. I am pretty convinced that my greatest style influence is in fact rooted in struggles with poor self-esteem and my discovery of style as a mechanism by which I could navigate periodic assaults of self-doubt.
As to the other four registrations, however, Zanella "corrected" the registrations by omitting various "unused" items when it filed its Section 8 declaration in each case. Zanella argued that the registrations as maintained are not fraudulent because they “were corrected prior to Nordstrom’s use of its mark and prior to this proceeding.” Zanella also asserted that, at a minimum, the corrective actions raise a genuine issue of material fact as to its fraudulent intent.
On Easter Sunday, after our church meetings, we had a fabulous dinner with the other Vegas Andersons. After dinner the kids had their own egg hunt in the backyard.

A couple of these are warranted: Thanks to ‘abnormal brainwave activity’ and the loss of two front teeth in a bizarre accident in Ramallah (seriously), I always have those first two fears lurking in the back of my mind.
Lucky lets Johnson grass grow in their ditch. They don’t cut the grass. They don’t pick up the yard. They let the paint peal off the outside of their house. They don’t got no sidin’ like the Jefferson’s do. They don’t invest in their home. They don’t take pride in it. They allow junk to accumulate. It’s scattered all over the place. It looks like a junkyard with a couple of old cars left out back. And I repeat the Johnson grass has taken over. With crab grass and goat heads, it’s a gotdamn mess ‘cept the horny toads love it.
That being the case, by next Spring the US will be showing some clear signs that recovery may, in the wacky world of Bernanke, be possible without jobs; but even there, it isn’t without export markets. A massive inflow of bad debt at that time would sink the Fed in short order. Not even the Fort Knox gold could cover a debt 42 times bigger than its alleged gold content’s worth.

The problem is the chat. There's not a lot of women on there, so there's plenty of men wanting to chat. I want to play poker, dammit. Leave me alone. Of course, if you persist in bothering me, I will have to change tables, which I do with some regularity. I've made up the line..."I live north of Chicago" so they think I live in the burbs and so I don't get weird people from poker chat trying to find me. And it's technically true. We are north of Chicago. Of course, distracted male players sometimes don't pay as close attention to the hand as they should. Just saying...I'm at 129K from starting at 10K, so I must be doing something right. (No, Mom. I am not going to leave J for some guy on Poker chat. I always point out that I'm an old married lady. It doesn't seem to matter.)
For some reason, we have allowed the malcontent to assume moral prestige. We praise as "ideals" what are nothing more than fantasies--a world of perpetual peace, brotherhood, justice, or any other will-o'-the-wisp that has lured men toward the Gulag. The malcontent can be spotted in his little habits of speech: He calls language and nationality "barriers" when the conservative, more appreciatively, recognizes them as cohesives that make social life possible. He damns as "apathy" an ordinary indifference to politics that may really be a healthy contentment. He praises as "compassion" what the conservative earthily sees as a program of collectivization. He may even assert as "rights" what tradition has regarded as wrongs"."
Bottom line: unlike real PR companies, BookStoreMarketing.net and its brothers and sisters exist not to make money by providing useful services, but to grab a quick buck by selling cheap crap to exposure-starved authors. Many writers are attracted to such services because they seem inexpensive (at least, compared to more reputable PR options), and promise a wide reach. But cheaper isn't always better--in PR, you get what you pay for, and cut rate services are no bargain. Also, effective PR needs to be targeted and personalized, not tossed at the wall, spam-style, in hopes it sticks. "One size fits all" is a size that fits no one.
Finally, ask yourself: what if Tim was Muslim? Then what kind of reaction would you have to all of this my dear evangelical friend? Would he suddenly be a vessel of the devil? Would this terrify the country? Would his success give credence to the radical agenda? Would Focus On The Family start an, in *love of course, slandering add campaign?
So, this was Mike's Company Christmas party last weekend. It was in a ballroom at a local hotel, so sorry for the poor lighting on the pics. We did a White Elephant gift exchange and were told to bring something free/cheap and funny. So I will explain the pics. The small pic with the 2 guys is Mike and his co worker. Mike got himself a boot ornament. He was incredibly impressed with it at the time. As the Crown Royal wore off, he was slightly less impressed! LOL The gal top left got an aluminum foil bikini, the gentleman got some groovy sunglasses, the next guy got a plate of sausage made to look like poo, the next gal got a rather large pair of men's underwear with prison stripes that say "most wanted", and the best for last. The guy on the bottom got a deck of cards wrapped just perfectly so when he opened it, he had to play 52 card pick-up, whether he wanted to or not!! LOL A great time was had by all, especially my DH Mike. He may have taken too many trips to the open bar, but I have to forgive him. We never go to bars downtown so this is his one time a year for letting loose. I was apprehensive of what he would think of me putting the pic of him on the LO, but he just laughed at himself. So with that,

The sentiment panel is from the Tiny Words set and has been stamped in Memento Tuxedo Black and Old Olive. I cut the border and centre out with Large Circle Nestabilities and popped the centre up on foam tape. I gave the butterfly I touch of colour with Copics Y11 and Y21. To finish off the card I added an ivory bow to the ribbon and topped it with a blue button and silver cord.

Ogres and trolls pop up in modern MG/YA fiction every so often, as well. Keely Parrack says, " I love Neil Gaiman's short story 'Troll Bridge.'" It's a haunting story about a troll and the man who goes looking for him. Lisa Gail Greens tells us, "I'm rather fond of the troll in Holly Black's Valiant. It's an awesome twist on the typical fairy tale in that he's the love interest and the human female protagonist has to save him." Ellen Booraem adds,

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F. Combine the rhubarb, sugar and vanilla bean and seeds in a bowl. Transfer to a 6-cup (1.5l) capacity ovenproof dish. To make the topping, combine the flour, sugar and butter in a bowl and rub with your fingertips until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Pile the mixture on top of the fruit and bake for 50 minutes or until the topping is golden and the fruit is soft.
To stay fair, I have to tell that I enjoyed the fashion show, I enjoyed being there once again and I just loved flipping through the thousands of clothes rails of different designers and taking some looks on cool jewellery designs. But the fact that people where nearly rushing through everything and screaming like idiots around, seriously acting like this is the end of the world left me rather with the feeling of a wild mixture of final sales at Topshop and the very last time Primark opens its doors before shutting down forever. Not to mention that sometimes (obviously depending on the designers and labels) the prices were absurdly high (haha you people don't get me with your "10 % off JUST TODAY"-strategy (been tricked out by Selfridges for my curling iron ONCE in a lifetime)), my budget told me to calm down & keep it as low as it is (not lower).
In a stroke of genius (and a way that allows more fans to see the festival line-up) the 2012 festival is taking place over two weekends in April--and the exact same line-up for each day will play twice in a row over the two weekends.

It’s actually very difficult to know what to write about it, because I was brought up to be very aware that the Evil Eye, would trip up boasters and braggers. My grandmother would never praise or compliment any of us without a muttered ‘kenayna hara!’ a kind of Yiddish superinjuction against the Evil Eye, followed by a highly sylised ‘Pah! Pah! Pah!’ - her way of spitting in said eye. My mother does the same thing. And (silently) so do I. I'm not a very Yiddish person (extraordinary how three generations can reduce a language to a handful of words, and that those words are things like 'rag', 'mad religious person', and 'grudge relating to wedding invitations') but fear of the Evil Eye goes deep.

I'm ready to rock and roll, but she's done, maybe for the night. Way to much wine. And it's probably more those damn Diet Coke's that she drinks. I keep telling her that that stuff is junk (even the diet version) and you should drink water. But whatever. I'm wide awake and ready to keep beering, and she's out like a light. Anyway, we had a great time drinking beer and wine in the Hill Country. I'll probably save the bulk of the information about this trip for The Session later on next month.

We have created a raised vegetable bed from some old oak groins salvaged from a building site, we bought a plastic greenhouse which is now full of tomato plants and herb seedlings and I had scrounged 2 old butlers sinks from my mum ages ago that are now planted with asparagus and some more herbs. We bagged ourselves some potent Turkey muck from the farm so all the ingredients are there.

Last night around 10:30, I heard her rustling around in bed. She had been complaining her leg hurt, before she went to bed, so I ran in to check on her. She started thrashing about and crying. I tried to talk to her, but she could not get a word out. Her eyes looked delirious.

That’s how you avoid it!

The taste: PERFECT! Nutty, malty, a slight chocolate in the middle, with fantastic strong but not crazy hops. Can't nail down the type of hops, but they fit great. Moderate strong carbonation to cut any chance of cloying malt. Medium mouthfeel, fantastic malty, nutty, hoppy aftertaste.

The music in this anime is great as well. The insert of last season’s opening song was a nice touch and I was elated to hear it. The broken Engrish aside, it’s just so catchy. At least I can understand what the singer is saying in the first opening song, I could barely discern what vowel she’s mumbling in the second one. Despite all that, the opening songs and ending songs are superb and feature the voicework of each girl’s seiyuu. Thank god they didn’t put Keima in there, because you know, he might be a good seiyuu, but he can’t sing for his life.
This week's theme was "plate ending in 4" and again I had to struggle to find a decent image on a given plate. This week's trouble maker was plate m64. I decided to use this image because it was working the best from the ones I liked on the plate (I'm not a big fan of the plaid design). The color combo is something I've seen a few days ago and don't remember where. Before that I had no idea that green and gold go this well together.

The last item I have to share with you is the Madison Fabric Memo Board priced at $25.99 which is also a JoJo Design. Though it is not a zebra or hot pink, it fits perfectly fine. All of the colors are themed right and after you put pictures, drawings, notes or even hair bows you aren't able to see that it isn't zebra. The detailing of the ribbon and the buttons are done perfectly. Each section is sized and spaced just right. The ribbon is snug enough to where you are able to get something in behind it but also it holds it in place very well. There are two metal hangers on the back and allows you easily hang it on the wall. My little girl loves having a memo board, you just never know what you will see on it from day to day.
I want my children to grow up thinking that people can be fair and kind and wonderful. That I am fair and kind and wonderful. That they can be too. I would rather my kids start with this assumption, and be disappointed by those who contradict it, than start with the assumption that people are just unfair and we all have to accept that as part of life.
First of all, thanks to everyone for their feedback to the questions I posed last week about themes. There was a considerable degree of agreement between all those who responded, and this can perhaps be summed up as follows:-

Kitchen Bar Stools – They’re Not Just For Breakfast Anymore!
The problem with identifying that I suffer from ThingsAreNeverGonnaChangeItis is that I am now paranoid that things are going to change all the time. I fear that nothing is permanent. This has been a problem since I broke up with my ex fiancé in such a catastrophic manner. I keep thinking that every future relationship is going to end in the same shocking and heartbreaking way. So, refusing to be caught off guard ever again, I find myself constantly looking for cracks in my relationship or signs that things are about to shift dramatically. Since this obviously isn’t the healthiest approach to an adult relationship, I’m working on it.
In the 48 hours I had before eggs started showing up, I obsessively researched incubators. They come in several styles from refrigerator sized with climate control to a glorified Styrofoam mini-cooler with a heater. It turns out this is a bit more complicated that I anticipated. The eggs are supposed to be kept a constant 99.5 degrees with 30-70% humidity depending on the stage of the hatch. Also, the eggs have to be turned at least three times a day, or the chicks stick to the egg shell. After realizing that it was a bit last minute for shipping, I ran down to my local feed store. Luckily, they’d just received an order of incubators that day. For *only* $160, I returned home the proud new owner of a Styrofoam mini-cooler with a motorized egg turner.

It is a scientific fact that all humans today are genetically linked to the Bushmen from Southern Africa.

Oh – and about determining the speed of light. Think about it. I believe Galileo once took a stab at this by stationing observers facing one another from different mountain peaks. They then uncovered a lantern at a predetermined time. No luck. Light is much too fast for this kind of experiment. Hey – light could go completely around the Earth more than seven times in a second! But here’s how Jupiter’s moons helped determine the speed of light more than 300 years ago! These kinds of discoveries always leave me in awe at how brilliant the discoverers were and how precisely they were able to make observations with tools that were not nearly as good as the inexpensive telescopes available to anyone today. The account which follows can be read in full here. It is from a posting by Michael Fowler of the University of Virginia Physics Department. One more thing to appreciate as you watch Jupiter’s moons.

Discovered there has been a new walkway path made that goes a long way up the big hill, it was pretty steep and narrow but a well made path, so we just had to follow it up to great viewing point with a fine view over Picton, we lingered enjoying the said view, without a camera to record it! Then went on further till eventually the walkway came back down again and branched off in several directions, we follow one of the smaller paths till I came upon lots of big bags of potting mix! Never a good sign when your in the middle of nowhere on a small pathway! We didn’t hang around looking to see if there was a small plantation of anything there should not have been, we just turned and raced back down and off the big hill then on home.

In his latest diatribe he claims how, according to an old NPR report, female American soldiers are often the targets of rape and sexual harassment in astonishing percentages by their male counterparts. Never mind the suspect numbers from the reliably progressive tax-payer-funded National Politburo Radio don't even come close to being on par with Department of Defense statistics, the execrable Farrakhan continues on to postulate that if male American soldiers are willing to rape female American soldiers, then they must just be having a field day in their capacity as an occupying army with the Muslim women in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Crown Prince LEE GAK (Micky Yoo Chun) wakes up and finds his bedside empty. He calls out and asks if the Crown Princess (his wife) is outside but receives no reply. He tries again as fear starts to build up and doesn’t get any answer. This turns him into panic mode – there should always be a lady-in-waiting or a eunuch outside – since Royals aren’t supposed to be left unattended. He shouted as loud as he could but still nothing – just silence.
Blake: New China III is kind of like Back to the Future III – it’s in a giant barn, so you have a real, westerny kind of feel, it left me satisfied, though I’m sure there are better versions, and I’ll stop by again when I’m in the area. This is the king of buffets, which is going to make it polarizing. If you hate buffets, nothing about New China III is going to magically make you change your mind. If you love them, it should be your first stop in Birmingham. We got out around $8 each, and the selection was amazing: the highlights being a sushi bar and 20 flavors of honest to goodness ice cream (not soft serve). I was happy to introduce Greg to the Lo mein, and the array of flavored chickens was luke warm and super tasty. I didn’t have a salad, because I’m a fat guy, but it looked like something you might like if you don’t like maximizing the potential of an all you can eat buffet. They had one row of American foods, which was bizarre, complete with pizza, wings, Mac and cheese, etc. I didn’t try that. I stuck to authentic Chinese dishes like sushi. I’ll go back here, alone, more times than I’m comfortable admitting. OVERALL RATING 3.5 out of 5 BROS

Interval training is a great way to get a bigger bang out of your workout time. Before starting a program, however, it’s a good idea to make sure you work with a San Diego boot camp fitness expert first.

In recent years the ABC has gotten an idea in its head that it is the Australian equivalent of HBO. The cast and crew of The Slap and The Straits liked to talk up how very much in the HBO-model they were and you can imagine the joy the ABC got from airing Angry Boys, a joint HBO production. While HBO is a commercial cable network and the ABC a public broadcaster there are some comparisons between the networks – neither relies solely on ratings to judge a successful series, for example. There are, on the other hand, much larger differences; like how HBO spent more on the first episode of Boardwalk Empire than ABC spent on all of Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries. There is another key difference as well: HBO would NEVER air Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries.

I cut my Evanovich teeth on the numbered Stephanie Plum novels, starting with ONE FOR THE MONEY. As of November, they’re up to EXPLOSIVE EIGHTEEN. It was always fun revisiting hapless New Jersey bounty-hunter Plum, her sidekick Lula the ex-hooker, her nutty Grandma Mazur, and her TWO love interests, Morelli the cop and Ranger the mysterious high-tech security consultant. The books are hysterical in places, sexy in others, with a comfortable level of nail-biting. Nevertheless, somewhere around ELEVEN ON TOP I stopped salivating and started just picking them up sporadically whenever I tripped over them. As I said, that’s easy to do—they’re everywhere.
"People sometimes ask me, 'If things are so bad, why don’t you just kill yourself?' The answer is that life is really, really good. I am a complex enough being that I can hold in my heart the understanding that we are really, really fucked, and at the same time that life is really, really good. I am full of rage, sorrow, joy, love, hate, despair, happiness, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and a thousand other feelings. We are really fucked. Life is still really good."
So easy a kid can do it!
8. Creativity. Many of our institutions — schools, jobs — are organized in such a way as to stifle originality and imagination. Yet these qualities not only improve individual lives, but are indispensable to the growth of society. We shall look at best practices in various institutions to develop guidelines for preserving original thinking.
I find this to be an amazing passage. I can understand that the Lord would hear the cry of the righteous man who is doing his best to live uprightly. But this passage is talking about a fool who is afflicted because of their own foolishness. They have sinned- it is because of their transgression and their iniquitiy that they are afflicted. They hate anything good and they draw near to death. And in that condition, a condition of sinful, self-inflicted destruction, they cry unto the Lord. “And he saveth them out of their distresses”. Wow.

BUT even beyond the project was the little tips or "Golden Nuggets" that you pick up from Sherry and other beaders just working side-by-side. I learned so much! I can't even believe how crazy fast my brain is working right now. Honestly.... this class was all about thinking outside of the box. Making components that can come together to creating something incredible!
I think this was a great loss. Sad day.
Soooooo, yes, prison. How did that happen. I guess last time I wrote to you I was just beginning my time as a man of the sea, joining the scurvy (No really, actual scurvy. Three of them told me they were afraid of orange juice) crew of 'The Flimsy Floozy' and their fearsome Captain, Charles Bearspit. I wrote to you then from what I believed at the time to be somewhere near Spain. Turns out we were in fact going round in circles just outside Southampton which is apparently on the south coast of England! I had misjudged these salty seadogs, and quite badly. What I had originally seen in Captain Bearspit as charming eccentricity was actually plain old bog-standard insanity. I began to realise things weren't exactly 'ship shape' when one week he insisted on calling us all 'SHIRLEY VALENTINE, M'LADY LOVE' and the following week he kept us all up every night singing to his knees. "OHHH KNEES", he would wail, "OH NAUGHTY, HAUGHTY KNEES. OH PLEASE. OH WONT YOU FINISH YOUR PEEEEEEEEEEEEEAS". This would go on for hours. Sometimes he would accompany himself with the punctured accordion we had found floating beside the boat a few days before. It was incapable of holding a note and yet the Captain would gamely struggle on. The wheezing sounds that emanated from the stricken instrument brought to mind my uncle Patrick when he went through his phase of smoking charcoal. Do you remember that, Rich? How we'd laugh as time after time, he set his beard alight. Good times.

Initially it was pretty cool to see the dive and the titanic in 3D but near the end you stopped noticing the 3D effect and just watching the movie. It is a pretty cool movie, still very long and I did have a tear in my eyes…again! Think I have seen titanic 4 or 5 times and it still gets to me…surprisingly I cry at different points of the movie almost every time! I did cry twice previous when the captain held on to his wheel and when the elderly couple were on the bed awaiting their doom but I didn’t cry at that point this time…think I knew it was coming and held my nerve but got all upset at the end…I was SO close from not crying!! So close!
For this winter’s pleasure reading, I devoured Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge (Random House, 2008), a novel in short story form. Olive, a middle-aged math teacher who is generally short on sympathy and long on criticism, is both extraordinarily clear-sighted and completely blind. And, though none of the stories are what you could exactly call happy, they did make me pause to reflect on moments in my life or in the lives of my friends—those moments that make a person feel both melancholy and deeply connected to the human race. Olive’s golden-age relationship with a widower was a bittersweet yet joyous confirmation of the need for and possibility of growth and compromise as each year passes.Learn more about Sex and the Office: A History of Gender, Power, and Desire at the Yale University Press website.

I came to the realization that I was in a depression, and it had very much to do with my Mom's passing, although I didn't put it together until recently. A complicated relationship, but we were always best friends. I loved her hugely, and I miss her so much.
Some of the people in my group seemed quite knowledgeable about street art; I did not fall into that category, and I said as much when we went around the circle to introduce ourselves. I let the group know that I had purchased my camera for my most recent trip and was still working to improve my photography skills. Other people just came for the fun of it. Interestingly enough, there was a mixture of both DSLRs and iPhone cameras.

For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
I just wanted to report that I have not fallen off the wagon :) I have been studying for my CPT Exam and actually today worked 1 on 1 with a client at the Anytime Fitness that I will be doing some training at. I was even able to close the deal on my first sale of a 10 pack of PT sessions - I'm super excited! In addition to the Personal Training at the gym I have been puting together 2 bootcamps that are set to start in December at two churches that I am involved with. I would love it if you would all chime in on what you feel are some of your favorite boot-camp oriented exercises! I covet your prayer support as I enter into this new chapter - God has opened so many doors lately with my Herbalife business, Personal Training business, and many new relationships with people from church.

I have many reasons to love these snack cubes. First of all they are made of tempered glass, which is nonporous and impermeable for food. Years ago when plastic containers were "in", I always managed to stain them with acidic foods like tomato sauce all the time and it irked me to no end. Well, with glass that won't happen and thankfully I learned that a few years ago and have very little plastic in my kitchen left. These are scratch, stain, and odor resistant. Being a glass product also means their is no risk of leaching potentially harmful chemicals like BPA, PVC or Phthalates. Glass is also safest for warming food in the microwave (without the lid of course). I also love the rounded edges of the glass cubes which help prevent chipping that can happen on occasion with any glass.

This tiny treat pouch was a cinch to make with our Pillow Box die and the Big Shot. I used a piece of Melon Mambo Patterns Designer Series Paper (their are four designs to choose from in that pack!) and simply cut it out with my Pillow Box Die. If you do this, be sure to use the Crease Pad with the Die so the fold lines crease only and don't cut through.

The game’s conclusions: the Navy is not adequately prepared to conduct long-term maritime Arctic operations; Arctic weather conditions increase the risk of failure; and most critically, to operate in the Arctic, the Navy will need to lean on the U.S. Coast Guard, countries like Russia or Canada, or tribal and industrial partners.

Throughout Alison’s life, she reads. Her father reads - he recommends her books from time to time. When she begins to think that she is a lesbian, she reads about it – all the books she can get her hands on. I can completely relate to this, and I’m sure many other readers can. When I want to learn about something, I read about it. Although I really enjoy a good debate, I am the kind of person who likes to be sure that I have all my facts straight first, and so in many ways I would rather learn intellectually first, before putting

Advice? First, make sure you know what you want out of your writing. There’s nothing wrong with writing for pleasure and if you want to share your stories with friends and family, internet self-publishing is much easier now. If your ambition is to be published traditionally, then make sure you want it badly enough, because unless you’re very very lucky, there’s little money in it and a great deal of stress. You will have to promote. You will have less time for writing and your family. The positive side is worth it for me: seeing your book in shops and libraries and meeting readers is all fabulous, as is a glowing review in a national paper. Best of all is the fact that people are reading your story and giving it life beyond you. The first time I saw a copy of my book in a public library was one of the most thrilling of my life!

The meaning of abrogation (naskh) is that the rule (hukm) of one revelation is completely cancelled by another later revelation. When something is specified it is abrogation of a kind i.e. partial abrogation but it is only in the stated areas of the subject. The criteria for abrogation and specification is that the abrogating or specifying revelation must have been revealed at a later date. It should be noticed that the verses of Surah At-Taubah were the last to be revealed concerning Jihad.
Montessori nursery school,
When my mom was alive, she always had my back. No matter how rough our relationship was, she was always there, just in case. But then things got too rough for her, and she is gone now. I felt, last night, that I had no safety net, but I quickly realized that I absolutely do. Not only do I have friends who are in this world to share a mutual love and support, but I have my own capabilities and resources, which are strong and have always come through for me. I have never spent more than two weeks looking for a job, and I will take anything that pays. When I come back from this trip, I will be okay. I will be more than okay.

But retirement is not in the cards for Dr. Siri after all. He’s dragged into one last job for the Lao government: supervising an excavation for the remains of U.S. fighter pilot who went down in the remote northern Lao jungle ten years earlier. The presence of American soldiers in Laos is a hot–button issue for both the Americans and the Lao involved, and the search party includes high–level politicians and scientists. But one member of the party is found dead, setting off a chain of accidents Dr. Siri suspects are not completely accidental. Everyone is trapped in a cabin in the jungle, and the bodies are starting to pile up. Can Dr. Siri get to the bottom of the MIA pilot’s mysterious story before the fortune teller’s prediction comes true?
Once again an Independent Conservative voice entered the race when local business owner Chris Foschini threw his hat into the ring. Now voters in the Beverley Manor District will be able to choose a candidate (also a write-in) who actually reflects their values and concerns. A parent, with one son in the Army and two younger children in Augusta schools, Chris wants to see practical steps to train students for their future lives as citizens. Observing that so many problems government attempts to solve are the result of bad financial decisions, Foschini envisions a mandatory financial requirement for high school graduates.

This past weekend I took my son to his Pinewood Derby District Race since he placed first in his local Pack overall and qualified for the District Race. My husband could not be with us for the races because he was coaching soccer games all morning for our 3 oldest. My son missed a part of his game to check in at the derby race in time.
Some friends and I were having a conversation on tango the other day and the subject drifted toward the manner of dance here in the states, in particular, what seems to be a common tendency among highly skilled dancers and professionals. To specify, I'm fairly certain it was in reference to many who dance in the style generally referred to or understood as "neo" or "nuevo," which quite frankly seems to comprise many of the well known professionals. Anyway, my friend was saying how she finds that most people she has danced with in this style who are from this country have a curious lack of dynamic compared to people from Europe or Argentina. By "dynamic," we mean the manner in which energy is shared between partners; the give and take of force. For example, how the leader can mark a propulsion in the follower and then use the energy from her subsequent inertia to power his own movement. (This can also work the other way, where the follower uses the leader's energy.)

The authors also take aim at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In Chapter 9 Have No Faith: Governmental Agencies Don’t Give a Shit About Your Health the authors say it’s “safety last” and “business first.” Their advice to readers in this chapter is to “trust no one.” (pg 112)

I'm sorry I haven't updated since the last post, which was quite a crisis time. She stabilized that night, and hasn't had another episode like that. Thank goodness! The metabolic geneticist came in the next day and talked to us in depth. He feels that the episodes were not true metabolic crisis but rather a reaction to pain. It makes a lot of sense, when we review it looking back. Her lactic acid was high, but that is expected when you are in pain or stress. This was the first time we had met the geneticist at this hospital, and he had a lot of good information for us.
i've been listening to jens lekman's supreme ep non stop, it almost makes the morning commute fun. i like the feeling of being very matchy matchy when dressing myself - got spots on spots today (to match my spotty face, haha). the last few weeks have been über busy which almost justifies my recent indulgent splurges. got some lovely dr martens in the sale, but my wonderful wonderful boy bought me the most beautiful apc sandals. then i got myself in a bit of tizz in liberty this evening whilst going through the remaining bits of their sale - got that carven flared leather skirt i've been coveting for the last few months and a pretty silk sea ny dress.
With that coordination improved, you will be on the road to total healing. When you’re healed, you can decide to cut down this exercise to just twice a week for six (6) months. Then, move it down further to just once a week for the rest of your life. This is now more of a preventive medicine exercise, “para sigurado” as we say it in Filipino.

To make matters worse, Muslim immigrants were far more likely than the natives to commit violent crimes, and an overwhelming number of their victims were indigenous Europeans. This disproportionate criminality was especially evident where the crime of rape was concerned. Muslim immigrants were apprehended and prosecuted for rape in overwhelming numbers. Over a five-year period in Oslo, every single stranger-rape in which the perpetrator could be identified was committed by a non-Norwegian Muslim.

Places We Are Going/People We Are Seeing: Yesterday we had a baby shower for my Sister In Law. It was so much fun. My brother and his wife came in from out of town for the shower. The girls helped put it all together along with my Mom, my two Aunts, and my cousin. It was nice to see family I had not seen in a while. We also celebrated Happy Hearts Day this week with family, which was a blast! Ash had her second dog training lesson with Bella. They are both doing very well.
The “Boulevard”, from Red San Luis to Callao, known as the Calle Pi I Margall, after Francisco Pi I Margall, (some spell it Maragall) a man who had been the country’s president for one whole month in 1873, and the roadway was completed by 1921, although building continued until 1927. This was meant to be the pride of Madrid. A street of iconic buildings, grand hotels, luxury shops, including Spain’s first department store, and a new theatre, the Fontabla. Together with the work of the American architect, Weeks, Spanish designers, including Zuazo Muguruza and Antonio Palacios, the designer of Madrid’s Metro stations, were also included here.

The main stance I was holding in my part of the debate was that a person must always stay honest and true. For the moment one starts with lies, he will never end, and these lies will eventually get caught. I then brought an example how the other team’s stance can be taken out of proportion and may cause more damage and harm rather that what they are so desperately trying to protect. Maybe the example I brought may have been a little too harsh and direct for some individuals, maybe it had offended him personally. Yet a debate is a debate, my aim and goal was not to be correct or right, it was to get a certain message across. I did not make it personal and nor was I expecting anyone else to take things personally. However that one specific individual decided to take it personally and very personally indeed. He went to contact the whole group to complain to them about how he felt and went on complaining about how wrong I have been in bringing up my example. (This statement has not been confirmed and I am only assuming this simply based of the outcome – I suddenly started getting text messages from a whole bunch of people saying that I was wrong and that I shouldn’t have done what I have done and that the other individual was hurt – I even got a text message around four in the morning!) I found this very odd and strange. If that individual had an issue with me personally, he should have picked up the phone and called me directly. I would explain to him and clarify to him on a more personal level. Instead the individual never called me, nor contacted me – he simply posted in the forum how wrong I was.

So, what exactly is the big deal? More to the point, since its so blatantly obvious that Huck is referring to Romney, why would he deny it so strenuously? I suggested to Professor Jacobson that it might have something to do with the fact that Huckabee is currently employed by Fix News, which has him under contract, and that Fix News is itself in the tank for Romney. He responded to me with a link to Roger Aisles Twitter account, specifically a screen cap to a Tweet which, while not exactly a ringing endorsement of Romney, certainly makes plain his dislike for the candidacy of Newt Gingrich.

The expository piece told how Stetson moved West during the gold rush and eventually came to invent the most commonly used cowboy hat. His road to success was bumpy, filled with failures. Back east no one wanted to buy his invention, but out West it became a necessary accessory. After finishing the story, the class began to take a stab at the big idea. “Don’t give up on your dreams.” One student suggested. Mr. Allen contorted his face. “That’s alright, but I think we can do even better. Does that sentence tell us anything about John Stetson’s journey to success? Let’s try another.” He picked another student. “Just because something doesn’t work at first, does not mean it will never work at all.” Exuberantly Mr. Allen replied back while nodding “That says a lot doesn’t it. Now that’s a big idea.”

I get bored easily. As a child, everyone thought I wasn’t being challenged enough. This meant advanced reading classes or new educational toys to get the most out of me. It turns out I really was just bored. As an adult, I figured out how to manage that boredom: from time to time, I take things apart and put them back together. I typically subscribe to the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” motto, but sometimes boredom wins out. When it isn’t broke and it is successful, I err on the side of caution and let it work.

You may have seen the earth friendly mats that are available and if you are conscious about the environment, this can be a great choice. Cork yoga mats are environmentally friendly and very comfortable but they may not hold up very long. If you plan on doing yoga on a regular basis this may not be the mat for you. A rubber mat is also environmentally friendly but you want to make sure that you do not purchase a synthetic rubber mat, or you may have the same problems that occur with the plastic mat and a synthetic rubber mat is not environmentally friendly.

If we can bring it all under one umbrella and not have our voices scattered in different places, we will reach further than before!
Like the embattled earthlings in “V” we, as a people, are under threat from people who seek to destroy us and our entire way of life but they are not green skinned aliens or poor David Icke's nine foot lizards, they look like us, because they are like us and hate us for it. They are the enemy within.

Consider what Wu achieved. She invaded Korea and Tibet; reformed the administrative system of the Chinese empire; provided Buddhism with a warm embrace when its influence was waning across the Indian subcontinent; and, vitally, she was a patron of printing 700 years before it arrived in Europe.
At the beginning of Christmas week, I baked up boxes full of treats for my neighbors, as is our annual tradition. We all exchange sweets, and for two weeks, the counters are just loaded with cookies and candy. Tom's fudge and Kristen's buckeyes are my absolute favorites, but mostly I love the tradition of baking for each other.
The Australian print have a missing scene of about four minutes at the beginning of reel four. As far as I see it this particular scene had been cut by the local censors in Australia in 1930. The soundtrack however still had this scene intact so I decided to keep the sound and replace the picture elements with stills. I used frames from an earlier scene in the film for this. Another oddity about this missing scene is that the first thirty seconds of it was found between two scenes in the middle of reel five where it clearly didn't belong. I corrected this and put it back where it was intended to be.

5) The story of Atalanta. I knew this only through Free to Be ... You and Me for a long time, and it did, naturally, smooth over some of the grislier parts of the myth. It looks like the forthcoming Pixar movie, Brave, plays with the "I want my princess daughter married off!" part of the story, purposefully or not, but I want a real exploration of a girl who became a fierce hunter after her father left her on a mountaintop to die. (You think your dad is strict.)

I am totally into ‘houses’ these days, so this one, of course, caught my eye! Very nice!
I remember this look being followed by the comment that “a photograph is worth nothing” since I kept snapping and snapping them. I’d argue that that’s only true (for me) with portraits; I am trying to figure out how to take good ones (and haven’t yet) so I take a lot, trying for but rarely capturing that perfect expression. For most of my other photos, I take one (or maybe 2 or 3 from different angles) and that’s that.
We haven't told Landon about the move yet. Now that our vacation is over and we're about to get a sign in our front yard, we'll tell him soon. He's going to be sad to leave his friends- most of them have been in the same class together for 3 years, but he's a nice mix of mellow and outgoing, so I think he'll adjust pretty easily. Claire won't care as long as her books and her family come with her. And as always, as long as we're together and we can snuggle in bed on the weekends, everything else is secondary. No matter how much I cringe at thinking of moving twice in the next year. And oh, I cringe.
This article examines the ways to avoid harmful substances in everyday products and looks at a handful of all-natural ways to free the body from their poisonous grasp. In addition to providing us the necessary nutrients used by the body to evacuate toxins, the natural substances described in this article also help maintain general heath. Regularly consuming cilantro, garlic, turmeric and Omega-3 boosts the immune system, improves rational thinking and increases memory. The amazing properties of those simple ingredients are only now being (slowly) documented by science, but they have been used by cultures worldwide for centuries.

Since then, I've managed to leave my life in California, travel throughout Europe and blog about it to you, dear reader. If you've skipped a few days throughout the year, no worries. Here are some highlights:
Tropical fruits in Bali are refreshingly satisfying, but more importantly, they are fresher than fresh. I think it may have something to do with lack of refrigeration at the markets and perhaps in many homes. Therefore everything is harvested just in time for selling, and bought just in time for using. Or so I've been reading. At any rate, they are the freshest tropical fruits I've had in a long time.
When working with my clients, I educate them about the importance of being “showing ready”, otherwise known as “staging”, as we only have one opportunity to make a great first impression. Staging accentuates the value of a home and if done effectively, can actually create value. In fact, after pricing, staging is the most effective way in getting your house sold for top dollar.

The campaign against suburbia is the result of laws passed in 2006 (the Global Warming Solutions Act) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and in 2008 (the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act) on urban planning. The latter law, as the Los Angeles Times aptly characterized it, was intended to "control suburban sprawl, build homes closer to downtown and reduce commuter driving, thus decreasing climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions." In short, to discourage automobile use.
And we won't, either.
Though the brewkit was puffing away merrily, only one house beer was available: John Edwin Bitter. It's a clear orange-amber colour with a sharp and waxy bitterness at the front plus some of the grainy flavour I've come to associate with brewpub lager on the tail. It's decent as it goes, but not a great example of small-scale brewing. Not to someone who's just come from The Kernel, anyway.
My dad got me up on top of a ladder, which was on top of the roof, so I could start running the brush through. By the way, I forgot to mention that my dad just randomly owns a chimney sweep, I mean who just randomly owns one of those… this is the type of stuff that should be left to the professionals. Anyways, I couldn’t get the brush to go all the way to the bottom of the chimney.. so we pulled it out and attached a rope which we dropped down the chimney first. This was my dad could pull and I could push at the same time. Meanwhile, my sister is standing on a ladder at the side of the house and is supposed to be able to hear both me and dad so she can relay messages.
Now if the controversy of ME3 would settle down I might get around to playing that.
As a track record, therefore, this is as fake as fake can be. Unfortunately, the SterlingHouse website looks fairly professional, making it easy for an inexperienced writer to assume that it's a commercial publisher (gosh. Do you suppose SterlingHouse intended that??). Googling SterlingHouse brings up some of the negative information available online--but you don't find it unless you go many pages into the search, and most people probably won't be that persistent. You can also get the info you need by checking Preditors & Editors, or emailing Writer Beware--but probably many people won't do that either. I'm sure that the writer who contacted me today isn't the only one who was taken in by this agent's "sales."
A class of evil oligarchs that continues to abridge our powers to co-create and earn our rightful keep must be met with penalties in due time as an operation of cosmic laws.

My only wish, I suppose, is that directors of sequels would realize this dynamic, because, quite frankly, I’m sick of the soulless, action and effects-heavy sequels that plague our cinemas today. Instead of turning up the volume, I wish they would do the more difficult work of exploring character. The result would be better movies.

We really did have a good meeting. We always have the same disruptive kids, but I always plan on them being disruptive. That's just how they are. One of them has a special need, and he's just that way. The other one isn't diagnosed with anything, so its either just not diagnosed yet, or who knows? Parenting (is that harsh? I'm sure people said that about Jake and us when he was that age...)

I noticed that not at one point in the novel do we find out what Janie's weight is. We don't get told her actual weight, and, although she thinks she's fat, we don't have her friends, family, or doctors try to convince her that she's not. She gets told she's pretty, but not whether she's fat or skinny. I just love that! It doesn't make a difference what her weight actually is, it's what she thinks about the way she looks that matters. Whether she is overweight or not, she is bulimic, and it's a change in attitude that's needed to help her recover, not necessarily a change in weight.

I used the smallest paisley pattern on the first, masking off the top of the card with a post-it note and stamping the image repeatedly, letting it overlap. It gives this sort of lace effect which I rather like, but it needed something else so I sponged it with Crumb Cake ink and that did the trick! It was very quick to add a strip of card stock at the top of the patterns and snip a ribbon tail in the bit that overlapped. I decorated the strip with three of my gorgeous self-adhesive pearls and finished with this beautifully ornate sentiment stamp from Thank You Kindly.
You know, I have to be honest with you I hope this is not what Christians are known for in 30 years because if we are, then people will have greatly misunderstood us, and we will have seriously misrepresented the mission of the Church. You know, it is not the responsibility of the church to solve or stop the HIV/AIDS crisis. I’m sorry, but it is not. That is not the commission that Christ gave us. And the problem with assuming it is, is that we can get so caught up in solving/stopping HIV/AIDS that we never get around to doing the real work that Christ has called us to. This is not to say we shouldn’t be compassionate, helpful, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent like the good Boy Scout church we should be. But I will say this, helping people with any disease and not sharing the Gospel is meaningless. I just cannot see how giving someone a cup of cold water is going to help them when they still end up in hell because we didn’t tell them about the Jesus in whose name it is given. But let me take the point further: Why is it always about HIV/AIDS? Why should Christians be known as leaders in that particular area? What about cancer patients? What about cirrhosis of the liver patients? What about people in Methadone clinics? What about prostitutes, strippers, or pornographers? What about helping homosexuals before HIV/AIDS? What about pediatric AIDS or crack babies? What about emphysema patients? What about being leaders in the fight against RLS? Seriously! Why does it always come back to HIV/AIDS as if that is the only disease ravaging this planet? What about Malaria patients? TB? SARS? Bird-Flu? Anorexia? Bulimia? Paralysis? Common cold? People with HIV/AIDS are not the only people on the planet dying from disease.

While I really enjoyed the Ice Capades in January, Phunkabration surpassed it. With four of the five beers being pretty great, it would have been hard for it not to. The degree of difficulty in making so many great sours was much higher as well and that has to be taken into consideration as well. Now, it's hard for me to decide which I liked better between the Phruit Phunk and the Phunkin' Wishniak as they both had a lot going for them so lets just say they were both my favorites. Makes me look forward to the sours they have coming at next year's event even if it's super far away. Not sure what's coming for March's event, but I won't be able to make it unfortunately so I'll just have to live vicariously through someone else.
Answer: Margaret Thatcher Speech at 2nd World Climate Conference November 1990. Now of course she does also say No-one can yet say with certainty that it is human activities which have caused the apparent increase in global average temperatures. But that was seventeen years ago, and today we have much more consensus among scientists, as the latest IPCC reports demonstrate.

Dawn, Chris and their boys (Shay and Matt) had always been fond of Hercules, having known him since he was a puppy. We'd spent many hours with Hercules at their property, which I've always fondly referred to as, "Fair Prospect" (from the A & E version of Pride and Prejudice). Hercules loved to romp with the other dogs, roll himself in the dirtiest parts of the paddock, and then plunge into the pool. He needed to run, and when it became clear last year that we could no longer provide him with a happy life in the City, Dawn and Chris generously agreed to take him.

Remember that it’s the little things that count. Details, gentlemen. When the other team’s coach calls for a full out blitz that usually means there’s a hot route somewhere. Maybe even two or three. In most cases the quarterback needs to recognize that and get his ball to his open receivers – and sometimes he needs to call an audible for max protection, telling his fullback and tight end to stay in and block. So if she comes on to you like there’s no tomorrow, evaluate the situation. Is this a hot route? Do you need to get your ball in there as fast as possible? That might be the case… or she may be crazy as fuck and you need to get out of there before you get to her apartment filled with baby posters and Scientology pamphlets and “forgotten” promise rings. In that case max protection means faking a burst appendix.
I've always loved chimpanzees and find them fascinating to watch. This film really showed just how intelligent they are and how they use tools to survive. It also showed a love between a mother and child and an adoptive parent. It was just great and I cannot recommend it enough! Such a heartwarming film!

#1. I spent much of last week making up some kits to take with me to a crop at a friends house. It has been a really long time since I have done that. It was very time consuming. I realized while I was working on them, that that was the only way I used to scrap. I would get my photos, organize then into pages, write down an idea, find a page to life, a sketch, and maybe which PP and CS to use. I would grab a kit when I had time to scrap and that was that.

All the actors were great in their roles with Christoph Waltz really shining on his part, adding witty comments to the rather serious atmosphere that made me chuckle and grin every time. Jodie Foster’s performance was a little overwhelming but still convincing, making me wonder how she kept up that mad mind-set for such a demanding role. Kate and John were both very charming in their performances but when their characters got out of their element it was surprisingly hilarious to see them use such robust and powerful words to express what’s really behind the masks they wear. And it completely proves that great actors don’t need any special props or effects to propel their performances, making it all come down to their portrayal of the character at heart, kind of like what you would expect from stage actors.

Standing in the Shadows, Shannon McKenna (Kindle edition) - This is the 1st of 3 or 4 Kindle books I bought for the whopping price of, I think, $1.99 each. Cheap or free, that's the way I'm testing the waters of e-books, for the most part... This was good. I never heard of the author before, but I liked the story of how Connor (one of the four brothers who star in this series of books) always loved Erin, but she was unreachable since he was responsible for her father's arrest. But when someone's out to get her, Connor comes to the rescue, even though she doesn't want him around. Good chemistry between the two, a pretty good story, and lots of hot romance!
There was enough suspicion of JFK’s assassination that yet another president assassinated by another “unhinged lone gunman” might raise more eyebrows. Nixon was disliked by the media, which made him a good candidate for political assassination. The Watergate burglary provided the opportunity. The Washington Post did the job with reports of “Deep Throat” meeting with reporters in spooky underground parking lots after midnight. Little, if any, information of consequence was contained in these reports. Instead, the newspaper’s reporting transferred the spooky danger of the deserted parking garages to Nixon and an aura of evil was attached to Nixon that eroded his support.
In the early 1960s, some Afrikaner anthropologists predicted that unbridled urbanisation, coupled with a superficial Western consumerist lifestyle, would not only rob Africans of their soul and unique culture, but also create a nightmare of nihilistic violence in the country.

Then I started thinking of myself. I've been having a really hard time of things lately, and I just haven't been able to make them anything but worse.

For one, Cookie Fridays have been a hit this year. At the ends of weeks when the kids have responsibly done their jobs and earned points (with good grades on school assignments, helping around the house, and not fighting), they have gotten to invite friends over after school on Fridays, and Sera and I like to make cookies as a snack for everyone. I think I have loved these afternoons as much as the kids have! It's been so fun to get to know my kids' friends better, especially the ones I don't know from church or anything. We've done all kinds of cookies: oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, pumkin, gingersnaps, gingerbread people, sugar cookies that the kids can decorate, peanut butter, and holiday M&M--a feast of yum, basically. On the last Friday in October (whoops, guess I should have included this in last month's post), we had a little Halloween party for Cookie Friday, and each of the kids got to invite 2 friends instead of 1. We decorated cupcakes, had a cake-walk, ate doughnuts off strings, had a treasure hunt, played kickball (Theo's request), and started a Harry Potter movie (but didn't get very far). Other than the party, these afternoons don't take much effort on my part aside from inviting the friends (a day or two in advance, which is where I sometimes fall off the wagon), and are often some of the quietest afternoons in our house as everyone plays happily with their own special friend. Going into the new year, I need to get back on the ball at a) checking off morning and afternoon jobs, b) giving out points, and c) actually making the play-dates, so these wonderful afternoons can continue!
Now, given that I pretty much just dove right in, my pictures are lacking on a how-to, but I promise I will be most descriptive.
As he left Elliot’s, there was an accident. A car swiped the front of Rusty’s Buick Special as he crept out of the parking lot. There was an argument. A shove. The other man produced a knife. When it was over, the other man lay on the street, and Rusty walked away as if nothing had happened. The man stood up with his hands pressed to his belly. Blood seeped through his fingers. He opened his shirt but held his hands over his stomach a moment, as if he had a bellyache. When the man finally pulled his hands away, a slick coiled snake of intestines drooped out of him. A vertical incision split his stomach from the pelvis to the bottom of the chestbone. With his own hands, the man lifted his intestines back into his own body, held them there, and walked inside to call the police. Again, I can’t say much more about that incident for fear of giving away too much. Defending Jacob is woven pretty tightly. It's hard to pull out one page without unraveling a lot more of the plot.
When I took it back, I thought, "Gee, I wonder if it's even remotely possible that they could get a copy of Art to Wear for me? Nah, probably not." But I asked. Since I'd had to pay $15 plus shipping to borrow the boro book, I figured this big hulking artwear book would cost an arm and a leg to ship plus some other, even-huger fee. But non: it cost nothing. There were several copies available in Texas, and I had the book in my hands, completely free of charge, within 48 hours. And mine for six weeks! Whoa. Interlibrary loan rocks.
In 1970 the Museum of Modern Art staged a "Lost Films" exhibit and published an accompanying book by the same title. At least two of the pictures in MoMA's exhibit -- Street Angel (1928) with Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, and Rex Ingram's The Garden of Allah (1927) -- have surfaced since then, so there's always hope. But London After Midnight remains lost, and the pages devoted to it in the MoMA book are sparse. Author Gary Carey wrote: "It is almost impossible to synopsize a mystery film which one has not seen because critics, bound by professional ethics, divulge little of the plot let alone its solution."
So we lower our expectations. We make the bull’s eye too big to miss. We live and dream in dreary black and white until we’ve downsized our dream list so small that we’re absolutely certain to get whatever is on it. How understandable.

I woke up this morning and immediately popped a bunch of antacids. I keep forgetting that compensating for not eating all day by eating too much in one sitting before falling asleep is not an efficient method of nutrient delivery. That morning dash to the bathroom to vomit or worse doesn’t help either.

Sport’s day practise was Saturday and the Sport’s Festival was Sunday. In between practices were lessons; Tom and I delivered 3 lessons to pupils aged 14/15 years and 15/16 years. Junior High School is for pupils aged 13 years to 16 years, then they go on to High School, where clubs are not compulsory. We delivered presentations to Grade 2 (14 year olds) and Grade 3 (15 year olds). The students were very tired having had a week at school, and one or two were asleep! This is acceptable in Japan as children are worked very hard, an expectation by the Government in order to keep them out of trouble!

And so it goes, in August 2011, as part of a field research internship with the Human Rights Commission Pakistan, I delved into human trafficking in Pakistan. The picture painted here covers many typical scenarios and forms of human trafficking that take place across the world. Here is an overview of the Pakistan context:

There’s this great 18th-century play called The Contrast, written by a man with the very un-American name of Royall Tyler, whose comedy of errors was a still-pretty-funny send-up of Americans trying to act like fashionable European dandies. Maybe inadvertently, but probably not, Tyler pokes fun at that most American of virtues: making money. Hey, I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that–I’ve been tweeting disparaging things about OWS-ers for months. But you have to admit, Royall Tyler has it exactly write when our heroine’s father spouts his favorite line half a dozen times throughout the first act:

A friend had told me recently about a beautiful walk and trails along the far end of the city running parallel to the river. Sounding like the perfect way to enjoy my early morning hours, I turned the car in that direction. At this end of the park was a skateboard park, restroom facilities, some picnic tables and a small parking lot. At such an early hour there were only three other unoccupied cars and a few intrepid early morning skateboarders arcing back and forth on the skate ramps.

So, staffer called, pallet moved... "No, honey, just this pallet... I only need zipper bags. No, not bigger bags, just zipper bags. You know? Ziploc bags? Yes! No. Those are sandwich baggies... Those don't even close really. They just fold over. I need quart and gallon size. No it doesn't matter what brand, just first ones you come to. What? I don't care if they're storage or freezer. Just the first ones you come to. NO! NOT THE SANDWICH BAGGIES!!! The ones that zip at the top and close up so you won't spill your food out all over your fridge! No I'm not planning on putting up vegetables with these, I'm packing to go on a trip and I need them for my suitcase. Alaska. Yes, I've seen Ice Road Truckers. Mmmhmmm... Fairbanks. (!!!) Yes, I know that's where their headquarters is. My son is planning on trying to go there. Mmmhmm... No. I don't really know who any of them are. Get you an autograph? Ummm... Well... umm...

The time came for us to go and we boarded our busses. I was sitting in the back of the bus next to the window. My conversation with one friend was interrupted by some other friends. They encouraged me to look out of my window at the pickup truck parked only a couple of feet from our bus. Directly across from me was that beautiful little girl in the white dress.

The trail divides into three sections that are marked off by two places where the Wild Turkey Trial briefly joins the Nat Greene Trail to cross over walkways and bridges. Beginning at the upper parking lot at the Lake Brandt Marina, the first section goes just over a mile. This section is among the most twisty, most rippled stretches of the trail. The second and third sections both begin with large hills. (The third sections starts just past the bridge at about the 2.7-mile mark.)

It’s easy to hate on Cristina Millian, what with her lack of any contribution to the show and that awful Dip It Low song like 10 years ago… But you know what she has over Carson Daily? The same thing that Ryan Seacrest has over him: ENERGY! With all due respect to Carson Daily, but Dick Clark had more energy a couple of months ago! I’d ask if it’s too soon, but that’s not a joke, it’s the truth! I get sleepy just watching Carson Daily, much less listening to him. Unlike Adam and Ceelo, he’s not annoying, so he can stay, but dump him to the back room to ask the contestants irrelevant questions. Get Cristina Millian up on stage to host The Voice. Sure, she could potentially be a train-wreck, but it would at least be fun!

The quirky love-hate duet "Could You Use Me?" was something that Eddie Quillan and Arline Judge actually might have handled pretty well if RKO had deigned to include it in 1932. But they didn't, and it was left to Mickey and Judy to bring it to the screen. Filmed in punishing 112-degree heat on location on a desert road outside Palm Springs (with pickup shots in the relative comfort of a soundstage back in Culver City), it's a cheerful charmer in which Judy manages to suggest that Ginger's resistance to Danny's brash advances is already beginning to melt.

Raised in rural Nebraska during the 1940’s and 50’s, Bob Meisenbach found himself at the epicenter of an emerging dissident culture on Friday May 13th 1960, when 64 students including Albert Einstein’s granddaughter, Evelyn protested against the House Subcommittee on Un‐American Activities lead by senator Joe McCarthy who had been holding public investigations into Communist infiltration of unions, the film industry and the teaching profession. The protests were the death blow to the House Committee on Un‐American Activities, paved the way for public dissent and became known as the day that made the “Sixties” possible. The assumed ring leader that day was Bob Meisenbach.

I slowly walked toward him and the photographers instructed me to tap him on the shoulder and he could turn around to see me. It was so strange, I had so many butterflies in my stomach and I was so excited to see his face. Bottom line the moment was magic and his first words were "OH J.C. you look F#CKING AWESOME!" Only he actually fully said J.C. He quickly covered his mouth and apologized and asked if the camera guy could edit that out. It was adorable, innocent and awesome all at once!

The Royal Navy were working at the scene within four hours. 42 ships were deployed to spray over 10,000 tons of dispersants. Efforts to use foam booms to contain the oil were of limited success due to their fragility in high seas. In an attempt to sink the ship and burn off and break up the oil, the RAF and Royal Navy dropped 62,000lbs of bombs, 5,200 gallons of petrol, 11 rockets and large quantities of napalm onto the ship.

I'm going to start this review by saying something outrageous. Who nees family or friends, hell, who needs food when you can lock yourself in a room and immerse yourself in the wonders that are the Soul Screamers series? I'm exaggerating, of course, but that should give you some idea as to how much I really mean my love knows no bounds when it comes to this series. No review I could ever write would ever come close to expressing how much I adore this series, and specifically this book (but I'm going to try!). If I Die surpasses My Soul to Steal, and I thought that was brilliant! I'm going to say something now I never, ever thought I would say. Are you ready? Ok, here goes. I love this series more than I love the Shifters series. I know! The Shifters series was absolutely phenomenal, and I didn't think Vincent could ever write anything that came close to how amazing it is, because how can you beat perfection?! Guess what? The Soul Screamers series is better!

The kind of price tag that makes your hands soaking wet with nervous perspiration as you start to calculate how long it will take you to pay it off once it slips from your now well lubricated palms.

Instead of trying to figure out the perfect mix of different personalities, I’d just rather get together with them since they’re best friends and I’m sure it would be a blast.

They ran a race and someone won and seven others lost. That’s how it works. Some win more than others, but all can lose. Shock and surprised? No I’m not. But then my memory is a lot longer than some others. Frankly it’s good for the sport. I’ve said all year that the sport needs rivalries and that we need to tout more than one or two athletes. Bolt v Gay can be exciting for the sport – especially when there is a question as to what the outcome might be. Predictability leads to boredom – and that’s the last thing this sport needs. We need excitement. Look at how much discussion this one race has elicited! Imagine what four or five races/events like this a week could do for track and field.

Hello, friends! How are you surviving the time change? I have to admit that while I really don't like having to make the adjustment (mostly because it's harder to get my kids up and down at the respective ends of the day), the extra hour of sunshine when my hubby is home from work sure is nice! Of course, today it is storming outside, so no extra sunshine, but at least we'll all be adjusted by the time there is, right? :-)

In general they get away with whatever they can: consciousness of widespread government corruption has entirely undermined even ordinary civic-mindedness about one's duty to pay taxes. Recent election results suggest that such resistant attitudes towards ANC rule have become virtually unanimous among whites, with white support for the DA reaching dimensions hitherto seen only in the Eastern European People's Democracies. But the results also show both the Indian and Coloured communities consolidating around similar views and the DA breaking into the African vote, indicating that the ANC is retreating from hegemony, not advancing towards it.
Not only that. Anti-smoking zealots themselves seem to have forgotten that they have held summits with fellow fun-hating bastards to train them how to further diminish your life.
I will be attempting this again, only there is one catch: you, the reader, get to decide the character this story will revolve around. I will have even less control, meaning this could be a crazy success or it could turn into a nightmare the likes of which no human being has ever dreamed possible. Personally, I think the latter could be fun, but that’s just my opinion.
My mother and sister are supportive, and without them, I would truly be lost. My father is loving, yet with a much more traditional outlook, and he's worried. He thinks unschooling has failed, because I'm not doing any of the things I "should be" doing by my age. He doesn't say it, he quite possibly doesn't even think it, but what I hear is that I've failed. That's not a nice feeling.
I'm so proud that I have a copy of this tune.

The jars in the cabinet in the background are just my rice and dried beans and grains and nuts and things. The stuff on the table (minus 3 jars that I gave to a friend the day before) was all canned in one weekend. There are actually 3 more large jars that you can't see. I have a huge stack of boxes of jars on the floor from all of the canning I've been doing this year. I've been giving stuff away and trading jars with friends, but it's still starting to take over the house. I need to get a cabinet to put all of this stuff in so it's not just stacked up on the floor.
The pesto is now ready to be used. Of course, you can use this pesto recipe for classic pasta al pesto – I also like with gnocchi – or to add flavor to a classic minestrone, in which just adding one spoonful of pesto will do the trick. And what about spreading a little bit of pesto on a slice of bread and top it with a slice of fresh mozzarella and a slice of tomatoes? Yum!

Now I'm jumping ahead of myself here as I wanted to do a couple of retrospectives on the D&D stuff we played before getting sidetracked into other systems, but finding this bought back a lot of fond memories of playing Runequest so here goes with a bit of history on that instead.
Ha... what's more exciting than making a simple goal difficult by throwing in a challenge?! Yup... we're putting a budget restriction on this. From March 20-June 20 we'll only budget $200 to get what we want done completed. That means we need to be extra resourceful with what we already have in the house!

The first bite was just a little bit of the pudding. I immediately tasted the richness of the coffee - bold, but smooth. After that, I noticed pure heavenly creaminess. Then I got a little bit of the sweetened condensed milk on the spoon the next bite....and it adds a perfect milky sweetness to the light, velveety taste and texture of the dessert. Oh, and the crispy treats on top! A buttery, caramely flavor and a pleasant light crisp. It adds an interesting texture to the dessert. It's almost like you're thinking, 'well this is kind of odd to just be sitting on top of this dessert'....but then you immediately think, 'wow, this makes sense! Brilliant!'

For the second card I took another nestie label and this time fixed it with a little masking tape on the inside of the card and dry embossed with a ball tool on both the cutting edge and the inner embossing edge. If you've not tried this before, it's a nice easy technique - easier with a lightbox (but I didn't have time to dig mine out so it is possible without one). Secure the die inside with the cutting edge facing the outside of the card, turn it over and rub gently with a bone folder - this creates a soft line on top of the cutting edge so you know where to put your ball tool to begin. The trick is to go over the lines a couple of times to get the depth (I use a double ended tool and start with a thicker end then use a narrow one for definition once the fibres have stretched) - if you go too hard and deep too fast, you just rip the card stock. You can do the same thing on an embossing machine but I think you get a deeper impression by hand.

“What about Hilldog?” I hear you ask. I personally think it’s too late for Mrs Clinton to revive her flagging political career by having sex with someone. People would think she was doing it to win votes rather than because she genuinely enjoyed it. It’s time for the Democrats to pass the torch to a new generation of highly-energised hotties with the drive and ambition to get on top and stay there. If Chelsea isn’t interested, the heir apparent has got to be Monica Lewinsky. There aren’t many women in America with her record of selfless service.
That’s still my position, and my goal. But recently I’ve experienced some stress that went above and beyond other stress I’ve encountered. Stress involving the welfare of a much-loved child. Stress that had me thinking, this is horrible, tragic, and whatever it takes to survive this pain I’ll do, because nothing about me is as important as this other thing going on. So I realize that sometimes stress can be so severe, and situations so dire, that not only do we grasp desperately at whatever comfort we can find (food being an available and helpful soother, along with alcohol), but it almost feels selfish and self-centered to even think about our own wellbeing when these other things are going on.
Whatever view you may have of European wine, always remember that nothing is written in stone, things change. If we had a time machine to go back to 1984 – when I joined the UK wine trade – with a bottle of each of these wines and tasted them alongside similar offerings of the time, we would be astounded. Because it has crept up on us we sometimes fail to notice how ripe, smooth, fruity, supple and downright delicious modern wines are. Neither of these showed much astringency or indeed anything that was unattractive in any way, which means that in their youth the rich fruit makes them pleasurable and as they mature the developing complexities will make them rewarding and enjoyable in a different way – although personally I have stopped ageing wines for anything like as long as I used to because modern wine is generally ready to drink so much earlier than the wines of my youth.
It feels sooo good.

He denied spending state resources on the affair, but wrote the state a check for more than $3,000 after admitting he had met Chapur on an economic development trip to Argentina and Brazil in June 2008.
Some BPC members may already know that three of my four co-assistant-organizers and I are moving on from the organization. I won’t go into details here of the past week’s events, or the reasons we were given for the mass dismissal; some of you will hear versions of it from others, I’m sure (and I’ll tell you mine if you ask). But here, I want to say thanks to all the members I’ve met, past and present, for inspiring me, making me laugh, and for keeping this group interesting for me for the past six years.

Another thing we walked away from? This adorable shirt. We are a touch obsessed with our wiener dog, so it was a big deal not to buy this. But it was too small for hubby and too large for me, so at TJ's it stayed. I am slowly starting to realize I don't need to buy EVERYTHING that has a wiener on it. Although I really want to.

Hungungu, son of Rota came from the country of Mangwende to tell Chief Chinamora that Chief Mhotani had died. Hundungu said, “I want to be a chief in the country of Mangwencle in Nhohwe. My elder brother’s name is Zinyemba. I am afraid that the chieftainship will be given to Zinyemba, he cannot rule the country well, because he is very weak.” Then Hundungu asked Chief Chinamora saying, “How can I get the chieftainship of Mangwende?” Chinamora answered him saying, “it is true that a person who wants to be a chief must be a brave man and one who loves all his people, I have no right to give the chieftainship it( Mangwende to you, but I can give you advice, so that you can be a chief. Go back to your country and when you have reached home, go to the chief of the vaRozvi. That is where you can ask to be given the chieftainship.” Hundungu thanked Chinamora for the advice and returned to his country.

Normally I wear white noise generators in my ears that tend to filter out a lot of “trigger” noises, like chewing and tapping. It doesn’t block out short/sharp sounds or very loud ones, like someone snapping a pen lid on and off, and those can make me have to get up and walk away to clear my head too. I have to hope I don’t look impolite.
Here’s a bit of ‘Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick’. The bodies are all definitely in the library. Little did I know when I chose this theme two months ago, that a headline of the Toronto Globe & Mail, on 02 December 2010, would read “Man Killed in Library with Crossbow”. Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction.
You can pretty much guarantee if there's any judging to be done, a fundie will be the first person to do it. In fact, their entire belief system seems to be based around all the things they hate about other people.
there was a time when that phrase was bandied about. The graffiti was everywhere back in the early 1970’s. Even my uncle Rembert, direct descendant on my mama’s side, of my family's Declaration Signer, would come along and add his affirmational personal signature to the graffiti.

If the emergency is, as admitted by the Congress, not total and, as admitted by the President, not the result of the war, Commonwealth Act No. 671 has lost its basis and cannot legally give rise to the executive orders herein involved. Indeed, it is not pretended that said orders are intended to meet any emergency growing out of the last war. Lack of a budget, an appropriation for the elections, or an import control law, has been brought about by the inaction of the Congress unaffected by the last war, and such emergency, if it may be called so, is not of the kind contemplated in Commonwealth Act No. 671.
Does this make Rice vs. Cameron a toss-up argument? I don't think so. Rice was a great hitter. Cameron was not. Charlie wrote on Facebook, no GM in his right mind would trade Jim Rice in his prime for Mike Cameron in his prime. I think he's probably right. It seems to me that the argument ends where it begins -- if you had a choice you would take Jim Rice over Mike Cameron every day of the week …

When I take pictures, I take lots of pictures. If they are sports pictures, or anything involving kids, I just keep shooting. I take lots of crap pictures, but sometimes in the middle of all the chaos is a good shot. But that means from a single hockey game I’ll have upwards of 400 photos. And I have to go through all of them and see where the good shots are and where the bad ones are. Wonderful. I wish I could make everyone freeze while I find the best shot and mess with my camera to get the right look on the first try. But that doesn’t happen

B 1160 had previously cleared both the state’s House and Senate, but Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell reportedly refused to sign his name to the bill in its original form. The Tenth Amendment Center reports that Gov. McDonnell wanted to veto the legislation, but that doing so would cost him the support of a large chunk of the state’s liberal voters. As a compromise, Gov. McDonnell added an amendment that is being favored by the bill’s sponsors and it is now expected to go on the books effective July 1.

Mr. President, I’m reminded of all who made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, including members of your own family. I pay tribute to those Afghans who have lost their lives alongside our men and women, and sacrificed for their country. Of course, our hearts are heavy as we remember so many who have died in this war. I’m grateful that this agreement pays tribute to the sacrifices made by the American people here in Afghanistan.

Botswana, with a population under two million, has the second highest incidence of HIV infection in the world; 1 in 4 adults have the virus. 95,000 children in Botswana have lost one or both parents to AIDS, and many of Ed’s kids also may not live to adulthood. Yet there are reasons for hope – thanks to programs sponsored by the government and its partners, the transmission of HIV from mother to child has dropped from 33% to less than 4%, and Botswana was the first country in Africa to provide universal access to antiretroviral drugs for all those infected. The problem is: how do you get an adolescent to adhere to therapy, when teens just want to be free, normal, and unshackled by rules?

Juniper (a type of berry fruits) can help the detoxification process is not only toxic but also remove excess fluid. It is very important for women, given the body tends to retain water in some periods of the menstrual cycle. In addition, this tea can also serve as an antiseptic to prevent inflammation of the bladder. In fact, some people also believe if one herbal tea can cure swine flu.
Sebastian: In the moment I was going freaking nuts. I had about a million thoughts going through my head. I wanted to tell her I knew, that it was me and I wanted her too, but knew I couldn't. I wanted to pretend I didn't know too--ya know, I was still a little confused and stuff. There was a part of me who was freaked to go there. But I really just wanted to know. I mean, i was feeling her and it was crazy to realize everything. I knew she'd be embarrassed though, so that was a huge factor in my decision.

Has is really already been 20 weeks?! It seems likes yesterday that I was taking an at-home pregnancy test, reading the positive result, and telling my husband to go buy more tests because the one I had was obviously faulty. Thankfully it wasn’t, but still… 20 weeks. The first half of the pregnancy just flew right by. I didn’t even get to enjoy most of it because I was so sick, but now that that’s all over with I hope that the second half of my pregnancy will be more memorable.

Emily soon became one of the most regular attendees at meetings, reading from her work in progress, a novel titled Our Street. Most authors will agree that they have much in common with their main characters. It seems to me that this was certainly true for Emily. Her narrator, Isla, was a special eleven year old girl who was aware of the social sickness that afflicted the other people living in her street; only she noticed the battered child, the neglected pensioner ... The refusal of other adults to see what she saw frustrated Isla and she decided that, if no one else was taking any notice of what went on in their street, she would make it her responsibility. She would watch and record all the 'wrong' things she saw and confront the adults with her findings, forcing them to act. Isla's determination, her sensitivity, her sense of social justice, her desire to change the world for the better ... these were all qualities that were clearly innate in Emily's own character.
If you’re like me, you probably sometimes go even further than complaining or resenting what the people in your life do or don’t do by trying to “fix” whatever you think is wrong with them. Whether the people I love are in addiction or grieving or just not happy, it isn’t my job to fix or change them. I can’t change anyone but myself, and I already have a fairly difficult time doing that most of the time. Thank goodness it’s not my job to change them. It’s my job to love them, and it’s God’s job to change them. I need to remind myself daily that I don’t have to do everything, know everything, or be everything. When I forget that, I’m like a soldier who has shot himself in the foot. It’s silly and unnecessary, and it can easily lead to discouragement. Sometimes it’s enough just to rest in Christ.

And she was looking at the flowers. So, I crouched down, and let my fingers feel the grass. She watched. And actually smiled. “It’s OK.” That’s all she said. I didn’t have to say anything. And neither did she. She sat down on the bench. And looked at the flowers a bit. Then closed her eyes. And after a moment, she smiled. “Thank you.”

Not only have we read about the progress of his medical treatment and the new things he has explored and learned such as meditation and vegetarianism, we have laughed and cried with Barry and his family.

See the humor. Cry. Love.

As we grow older, we forget these little tendencies of children. We forget to ask questions (of which we do not know the answer at all), to run and shout in empty fields, to smile at strangers and wish them well. We become a reduced version of ourselves and whoever walks out of the strict lines of adulthood is an outcast – immature, loser, weird, mad.

In any event, the book features some truly stunning and imaginative work: the organic blobs of Anders Pearson, the Duchampesque watercolor scrawls of Casey Camp, Henrik Rehr's shifting currents of densely packed lines, Mike Getsiv's suggestive, boldly colored swirls, Warren Craghead and Richard Hahn's mastery of panel rhythms, the unexpected visual gag inserted into Geoff Grogan's multimedia collage, Alexey Sokolin's forbidding stormclouds of black scratching, Andy Bleck's sensual scribble figures, Derik Badman's renderings of only background fragments from old Tarzan comics, the multiple contributors who turned in dense, virtuoso ink pieces towards the end of the book. Not everything here is at the same high level, but it's a surprisingly consistent anthology, unified by its theme and Molotiu's commitment to including pieces that advance his definition of this particular approach to comics. What's best about the book is how open its territory ultimately is, how much room it leaves for artists to come up with their own ideas about abstraction and sequence. It is a truly groundbreaking book that points the way towards a whole new conception of comics and challenges readers and artists alike to explore this new area. [buy]

Here two student projects:
The paint is fairly thin, even the “opaque” colours, which is what I got. I wanted a solid blue colour for a bowl I had in mind, so experimented with layering the paint. As they recommended leaving each layer of paint to dry 24 hours, this took a while. It took me even longer since at first I decided, “24 hours? Pfft, 8 will be fine. Probably.” It was not enough, and the paint simply rubbed off in a patchy manner when I attempted to paint new layers on top.

When we started our adoption of Makinley back in February 2011, one of my prayers was to get Makinley home before her next birthday. With just starting the process in February, I knew that we would be cutting it close to get her home on time. I did a lot of praying and I even made my friend at the adoption agency PROMISE me that she would be home before her birthday. I knew fully well that it wasn't up to my friend on timing, but I knew she would tell me if she didn't think I had a shot. She stood by me to the end and she reminded me often at the end that Makinley would indeed be home for her birthday. And so she is!!!

Why do I so desperately want to control these uncomfortable
I wish I had the time to dig up the entire yard and care for it in such a way that I could grow food year-round and feed all of us almost exclusively on what I grew, but that is not realistic. The temperature doesn’t allow for that and neither does time. So, we grow what we can, on the land we have time to till. At this point, we’re not saving that much money by growing some of our own food, but anyway, I don’t think that’s the point. Honestly, I think what I love most of all, is that I know HOW to grow food. That, to me, is just amazing. Maybe the second best thing is that, one day, my kids will know that potatoes grow in the ground and cucumbers on vines, not trees J

So, yes, I do agree with the ‘cliche’ which Burke quotes that ‘it only takes half a dozen for a bomb attack’. I would argue that this half a dozen will also require a silent majority, as it were, of Muslims who, all though they most of them would never bomb or riot, still support those who most certainly would. (There will be many Muslims who don’t bomb and riot quite simply because they are cowards, in the completely understandable sense of cowardice.)
In her research into discourses in a classroom situation, Millei explains her use of discourse… “‘Discourse’ is being used in a Foucauldian (Foucault, 1980) sense as a practice that is produced historically in a specific sociocultural context, is structured by assumptions and produces power. Power also constitutes and governs individual subjects, who become subject and bearer of power-knowledge relations (Foucault, 1980). Foucault (1980) asserted that some discourses have shaped and created knowledges that have gained the ‘status and currency’ of ‘truth’, and dominate how we define and organise both ourselves and our social world, while alternative discourses are marginalised.”

My main criticisms are that it often doesn’t make enough of the space it has, insisting on leaving sections blank (like ‘working titles) when there is no information for pre allotted sections rather than expanding others to provide some extra info; and most infuriating of course, the lack of an alphabetical index, which in a guide like this is crucial one would have though! Definitely loses a star just for that I’m afraid.

Nigerians and foreigners have been predicting that for years, but the Islamic radicals have indeed terrorized Nigeria, especially the Moslem north, and politicians are under pressure to do something about it. So far this year, Boko Haram violence has left about 1,100 dead.

It is just like with “starving”. We know what the word means, but we don’t use it correctly. I myself have never said “I looked ‘anorexic’” even when I was really skinny. The problem with saying that phrase or even using that word in that context is that “anorexic” is not a look. The media has painted as something negative. Not that it is positive, but when people think “anorexic” they think skin and bones, literally. They think of someone that looks like a walking skeleton; someone who is seriously malnourished, which is what they are. Anorexia just might be the cause of their malnourishment.

When a growing planet has acquired enough matter to be molten, it tends to fractionate out: heavy metals sink to the core, while lighter, rocky minerals float on top. That’s how we know that some of the asteroids are the wreckage of destroyed worlds: some of them are made of rock and some of metal, the different parts of something that already had a planetary structure.
Here are some blocks on which to sketch out your ideas. If you click on the picture, it will come up full size and you should be able to print it out so you can sketch as many times as you like.

If the truth be told, I've never been a fan of the circus. I suppose I was born at the wrong time, during a period when it was in decline. By the time it was given a renaissance by the new circus, the animal free spectacles of Archaos and the Cirque du Soleil I was too old. As this was a belle époque circus though, I knew I'd be seeing animals and I wasn't too comfortable with that. The website highlights the family aspect of the troupe, explaining that "même les animaux sont considérés comme des membres de la famille" (even the animals are considered to be members of the family), but I doubt that they truly get to sit at the same table to eat.

“Otters,” he said, and rubbed my shoulder. I turned my back to the glass. All my awareness of potential embarrassment slipped away. “Do they have otter tamers?”
Sorry the pics are not formal, but life has been crazy of late. Setting up some photo shoot just isn't feasible these days. Fortunately, life is crazy with family gatherings, so this increases the chances that I get pictures like this to share. ;)
Dawn Gee, Liberal Democrat candidate for the ward, said she thought it was "appalling".
Near the beginning, we’re on the Costwold Way. A bit beyond that farmhouse, we missed a sign, misinterpreted the book’s directions, and took a wrong turn. The book guided us to turn at a hedge, keeping the field to the left. That’s exactly what we did. Except we turned left when the book actually instructed us to turn right. We were oblivious, thinking we were following the mapped path for quite some time. After all, each instruction led seamlessly to the next.
Our charming waiter, Rommel, could not be faulted for his friendly attentiveness. When we heard about his napkin-folding skills, he succumbed to our requests and quickly made us a pair of courting swans, the body of which involves a structure that could double as the Sydney Opera House.
Now I just have to decide if we’re going to pull the boys out of school to jump on this Hawaii deal….

Tornadoes were sighted in Atoka, Johnston, Lincoln, Marshall, Murray, Osage, and Pushmataha counties in Oklahoma and in Chautauqua, Cowley and Saline counties in Kansas, NWS reported
The new furniture is coming this week, so we're trying to prep as much as possible. For now, their rooms are a mess (and I'm trying to be okay with that). I can't stand going to bed with a mess on the floor, but I'm getting over it. Poor Brownie's dresser is on the floor--it's just her drawers.
Poets are cultivating new climates for change.

First up is TheSixthAxis, who’ve done the book a kind service and presented a top-notch review complete with a picture of my face in monochrome glory.
Because I made a first batch of 20 .15oz lip balms and they turned out to be too hard. Like, can'tquitesmearthisonmylips hard and so I untwisted 20 lip balms back into the double boiler and melted them down for Try #2.

I shifted in my chair, not sure if I was expected to answer the question. “Do you have any preferences?”
Usually, the licensor agrees to communicate to the licensee information in his possession that it has a right to divulge, as of the effective date of the agreement. The licensee is advised to assure that the information, such as pertinent drawings, manuals, specifications and formulas, will enable it to produce the licensed product or use the licensed process successfully. Sometimes know-how will include the sale and supply of manufacturing equipment or apparatus used to manufacture the licensed products, assuming the licensor has such equipment and proprietary rights on it . In some patent and know-how agreements, the definition is put into the licence grant section. When there is a great deal of material, a listing and description are often made and attached to the agreement.
Waste of money!
But before they played, Kyan said the Little League Pledge before the game. Seriously melted my heart!
“Hey wait a minute guys. Why are you all looking at me? How do I sneak up on you, hit you on the back of the head, and steal your wallet? Turn around for heaven’s sake.”
I also love that they screw together, both the lids and containers, for easy peasy storage!
The Board first found (once again, without explanation) that the genus of services at issue is "commensurate with applicant's recitation of services." Turning to the relevant public's understanding of the term, the Board found that the submitted definitions of "nutrition" and "bulletin" directly apply to those services, but noting the following wrinkle as to the word "bulletin:"
More tornadoes swept the Midwest on Tuesday night, killing at least 15 people: 9 in Oklahoma, 4 in Arkansas and 2 in Kansas.
However, I'm afraid they may be a tad too formal, even slipcovered, for this room.
So what emerges from a president who is basically uninterested in foreign affairs, who doesn't see our manifold threats and challenges as worthy of presidential time and energy, who repeatedly stresses devotion to negotiations that are divorced from their substantive outcome, and who believes that multilateral fora rather than American resolve and power can address foreign problems? The now-indisputable answer is a failing, collapsing U.S. foreign policy.
What this report seems to say to me, when viewed in light of Pete Brown's findings, is that, actually, fewer people want mass-produced products and that the big brewers are missing out by under-investing in their cask brands.
How many of you have seen the movie "Risky Business"? Joel’s parents are out of town, and when they call to check in one evening, they can tell by the noise level that he’s having a party. “Just a few friends,” Joel tells them, and his mother says it’s all right. “You know we trust you.” Of course, at that moment, Joel is running a brothel out of their home and there are prostitutes wearing his mother’s clothes.
Update iPod. I rearranged my playlist but haven't transferred it yet.
Asked by the judge for the reason it occurred, counsel replied: 'Because she was on a rollercoaster and there was no right time to tell somebody who thought he was the father of the child. She was in an almost impossible position so far as coming clean,' counsel added.
Want to know more about honey, and bees and why they are so important, yet vanishing from our environment? Here’s some in-depth information, including a link to a documentary on the subject. Unfortunately the time has expired for being able to view the film for free, but I highly recommend watching it one way or another. I wish it would be required viewing for everyone on the planet! I hadn’t planned on watching it, but got started and couldn’t stop. Fascinating, informative stuff about the environment and the inter-connectedness of everything. :-)
she comes at him. “Take this ring,” she whispers. When he refuses,
Congratulations to the beautiful and lovely brides! May happiness always be with both of your families.
The basics haven’t changed from last year. Every voter will cast a ballot for the ten best teams in the country and a designation for the nation’s best team (the latter is used purely for tie-breaking purposes so that there’s always a clear-cut #1 in the poll results.) The votes are tallied and the school receiving the most votes is ranked first. The rest of the standings are also determined in the order of total votes received. Other than the tie-breaker, you do not place your selections in order, as that’s what the total tally is for. There will be a vote after every week left in the regular season, starting with the games of Week Six, and there will be a final vote after bowl season finishes.
After three years on the force, Jerry met Elizabeth Gray. A young woman who had her head in the clouds, as close to God as possible, Elizabeth was indeed Jerry’s intended blessing. They were a perfect couple. Spending time doing things, which didn’t involve a bed or a condom, the couple was undeniably a Christian couple. Teaching younger children in their church Sunday school classes, volunteering at Poverty Community Hospital and helping out every imaginable good-cause, was what made this couple tick. There wasn’t any good thing they weren’t involved in.
Find the Joy in the Journey…realizing that women are making progress in the workplace (except for that scary “finding a husband of your dreams” thing) brings a smile to my face!

Mark the compass points on the edge of the circle in eight places. I do this by folding the circle in half along the grain line, then half again. Finger press at the folds. This will give you N, S, E, W.
