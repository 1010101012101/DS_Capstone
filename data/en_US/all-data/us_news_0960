Director Christopher Alden’s production of the Mozart opera--a U.S. premiere in 2001-- had some elegant touches and was fun, if sometimes a little too cute. The current cast was mostly game for its incessantly florid, difficult vocal writing. And it was refreshing to hear youthful, light, agile voices that seemed meant to sing this kind of music--instead of the larger, more established types that tend to fill bigger houses.
New Jersey high school students will need to pass as many as 12 end-of-year tests to earn their high school diplomas, under a plan unveiled today that’s designed to ensure "a New Jersey high school diploma is a meaningful measure of college and career readiness."

1 Esqueleto: Curious about the provenance of this pair of slivered raw diamond earrings, that sea urchin-inspired necklace or even that psychedelic cross-section of fossilized coral? Jewelry designer Lauren Wolf is usually right at hand in her white-walled, airy shop to give the rundown on her works, talk up her finds or fill in the background of that specific designer. Her gorgeous handcrafted pieces, which have compelled celebs and draw inspiration from the creatures of the sea, as well as desert sands, are well-represented here, along with covetable pieces by Rebecca Overmann, All For the Mountain, Satomi Kawakita, and Mociun. Changing displays of artwork add to the gallery-like ambience, as does the care that Wolf puts into her displays, which incorporate delicate vitrines, ceramics, intriguing slabs of semi-precious stone and a formidable ram's skull that would push all of Georgia O'Keeffe's buttons. 482-A 49th St., (212) 920-5666, www.shopesqueleto.com.

Al Qaeda's relationship with Iran, a point of deep interest to the US government, was rough, judging from the documents. After the US invaded Afghanistan in 2001, some top al Qaeda operatives and their families fled to Iran, where authorities there put them under house arrest.

Political strategists know that these counties almost always support a Republican unless he comes wearing horns and holding a pitchfork (a characterization Republicans prefer to ascribe to Democrats). Still, it's a mistake to take the rural counties for granted. Not only are there more of them; but also Republicans can energize the voters there and push up their turnout, overcoming Democrats' advantages in the cities.
And it would be naïve to say that Los Angeles has never shown an interest in packaging or promoting its own history. But the past we embraced most energetically in earlier decades was often a mythical, faux-weathered or imported one; think of the 1884 Helen Hunt Jackson novel "Ramona" (and its associated pageants) or the original Getty Museum, a literal re-creation of a Roman villa that opened in 1974. What's emerging and even accelerating now is an interest in capturing the postwar inventiveness of Southern California like a firefly in a jar.

-Geek-speak isn't a turn-off. "The Avengers" didn't shy away from the geek. In fact, the movie embraced it, filling the screen with in-references and dense language about comic book items like the Tesseract. And the Marvel movie was directed by Whedon, the ultimate insider.

Last month, the Pentagon threatened to cut all of its funding for the Heroes at Home program. In Missouri, lawmakers are close to approving Gov. Jay Nixon's recommended $4.1 million cut to Parents as Teachers Missouri programs in its next fiscal year.

There was plenty of occasion for SLU to smile after this one. Other than its typical shooting struggles in the first half on some pretty makeable shots - "If we were really good and there was a big line on this game in Las Vegas, there would be an investigation," SLU coach Rick Majerus said - SLU took care of business against one of the league's lesser teams for its sixth straight win and ninth in its past 10 games. The Billikens (22-5, 10-3) remain in second place in the Atlantic 10, half a game behind Temple, and are moving ever closer to their first NCAA trip in 12 years. It was SLU's 10th win by 20 or more points, its most in one season, and, though this year's team has the advantage of a longer season, matches the school record for wins in the regular season.

Luckily, “A Holiday Carole” is produced (by daughter Louise Goffin, who contributed the just-okay originals “Christmas in the Air” and “Christmas Paradise”) like an old-school King album, which means it has plenty of superb piano playing.

Resellers obtain their inventory from season-ticket holders, who have paid the Twins full price and lack the desire to stand outside the ballpark trying to unload their extra tickets. Resellers will offer a fraction of the face value and, in an ugly market, season-ticket holders tend to reluctantly hand them over and absorb the loss. Best case, the reseller finds a buyer and turns a profit. Worst case, he eats the seats and loses his small investment.

There’s something about a prism of sparkling light that fascinates us all. We’re not quite sure what it is, but when we see it dance — the flicker of a glistening diamond, glowing frost-lit icicles, a twinkling star — we are instantly mesmerized.

A Star-Ledger analysis finds that while taxes did go up last year for most, homeowners paid an average of just 2.4 percent more for property taxes in 2011.

Before tonight, he'd been nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Song nineteen times, and only won once. Now, he's two for twenty. "We Belong Together," the spunky piano-rock number from Pixar's "Toy Story 3" earned him the golden statuette. The "Short People" singer, who last won in 2001 with "I Didn't Have You" from "Monsters, Inc." -- another Pixar film -- seemed shocked to take the award, and his halting acceptance speech was an unconventional one.

* About those NCAA seedings... the one that bugs me the most is Florida as a No. 2 seed in the Southeast. What exactly did the Gators accomplish to warrant such a lofty entry point? On top of that, if you look closely at the SE bracket, you'll see that Florida is in position to take advantage of a pretty easy ride. The first game is against #15 seed Cal Santa Barbara; the second game would be against an overrated UCLA or 14-loss Michigan State; and then in the Round of 16 the Gators would see BYU (minus its leading rebounder), St. John's (minus its leading rebounder), or Gonzaga (which is obviously beatable. I actually think the No. 1 seed in the region, Pitt, has a rougher trip: a second-round game with Old Dominion or Butler; then a Sweet

Most of the crops covered in the insurance program -- such as corn and soybeans -- are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, making prices easy to establish and insure against. Peanuts are not traded on the exchange and thus are more exposed to wild price swings. Also, Chambliss said many peanut farmers will switch crops depending on what prices look like for the coming year. That skews results for an insurance program that measures coverage based on farmers’ crop yields over a five-year period.

I love the Internet, particularly when I have to learn something new to address the letters that get printed in response to one of my letters and when I have to check Frank's ramblings for accuracy. While I don't think I spent a long time talking about Wisconsin and Scott Walker, Mr. Sorce seems to want to make the case for moving to the Great State of Wisconsin, particularly under the administration of Mr. Walker. I would rather refer to the local paper, in this case the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, to find out what is really going on there. In a Jan. 22, 2012 edition an article discusses the fact that the Wisconsin State Administrative Secretary wrote to the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services and stated that Wisconsin would have "an undisclosed deficit" from January 1, 2012 until June of 2013. How is that so, Mr. Sorce, when you state Gov. Walker eliminated the deficit and created a surplus? Well the article goes on to say that Gov. Walker claimed to have eliminated the deficit, but he was using a long-used budget trick that did not use valid accounting methods and if those more accurate methods were used (and Mr. Walker campaigned on the platform that he would use the more accurate accounting procedures) they would show Wisconsin was and will be running a budget deficit of $3 billion for 2012-2013. Mr. Sorce was also cheering Gov. Walker's job creating skills; but hold on there. In a July 21, 2011 article from the same source it was noted that unemployment rose from 7.4 percent to 7.6 percent and that most of the jobs "created" under Gov. Walker's programs were jobs in tourism, hospitality service and food service; jobs that are usually temporary, low-paying and carry few if any benefits.

The answers are all provided, and for me the big "aha!" was finally learning why the Obamas, far to the east of their Hyde Park stomping grounds, continued to socialize almost exclusively with the Nesbitts, Whitakers and Robinsons. For the past three years, I've been following the first family's every move via the pooled reports journalists get from the White House press office and it has always seemed weird how much Obama's Chicago friends were entwined in their Washington, D.C., life.

The latest effort by this latter-day folkie was co-produced by Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, who also happens to be Kathleen Edwards' boyfriend. "Sidecar," a fuzzy highlight, crackles with the excitement of falling in love. The end of a relationship informs other songs, including the haunting "House Full of Empty Rooms." Norah Jones harmonizes on "For the Record," but it's Edwards who shines throughout, with her bittersweet musings complemented nicely by moody soundscapes that bear Vernon's signature. Grade: A-

A Blues jersey with Matheny's No. 22 hangs on an emptied bookshelf. He brought in his own small coffee machine.
"I continue to have serious doubts about the advice rendered to us by the county attorney as it runs counter to the veritable mountain of case law that suggests Mr. Jones will, in fact, continue to be a 'resident' of the first councilmanic district during his short period of incarceration," said Benoit.

So far, the answer is "no." Political leaders don't lead. They take the path of least resistance, which has been to do little except to find scapegoats -- "the rich," "special interests," "liberals," "conservatives" -- that arouse their supporters' angriest antagonisms. It helps explain polarization. This is really what Washington does. It's a demoralizing commentary on the state of American democracy.

Hamilton Mayor John Bencivengo’s arrest for extortion casts a long shadow over the solely Republican leadership of our town.

But the presidential candidates hold out the hope that the European Central Bank will somehow come to their aid by doing more to "support growth" even if it means feeding inflation.

Bottom line: Not connecting with him.
-- Total flight time usually trumps other reasons for choosing a connecting itinerary. And, contrary to what you might think, the shortest distance usually isn't as big an influence as the connecting time. If you're flying from Chicago to Europe, for example, an Atlanta connection may involve more miles than a connection in New York, but a shorter connecting time may offset the mileage difference.
Still, for decades after the accident, Gregos faced challenges every day from simple things most of us take for granted — going to the grocery store, going out the front door. And then six years ago, his life took another dramatic turn. He met Beulah — a.k.a.

The Republican minority proposed a "level headed, level funded" budget that held spending to last year's $34.7 billion total. It had no tax increases, spent $600 million less than the doomsday budget, and was rejected by the Democrats.
Today, the need for a revived commission is apparent. The commission should be investigating school-discipline policies and our biased criminal justice system. We need a clear look at the apparently coordinated effort of Republican governors to erect barriers to registration and voting that have a disproportionate effect on the young, the poor, the elderly and minorities. The apparently racially skewed efforts to direct African-American and Latino homebuyers into exotic, subprime mortgages needs to be probed as well.

Like other recently minted teen heartthrobs — Joe of the Jonas Brothers, for instance — Bieber has decided to model his first tentative moves on the grown-up market on those made by Justin Timberlake after his break with *NSYNC. As the last man to escape the boy band cellblock, Timberlake is held in the highest esteem by all young pop stars looking to translate next-big-thing hysteria into a sustainable mainstream career. It’s tough to remember now, but JT was once a "Star Search" hopeful and a charter member of the Mickey Mouse Club. He, like Bieber, was regularly dismissed as prefab lightweight; even in *NSYNC, he was often unfavorably compared to JC Chasez and Lance Bass. Timberlake beat long odds by jumping ship seconds before the boy band revival grew stale — and by hiring hip-hop producers to toughen his sound and to make him sound more adult. The Neptunes worked on his first single; Timbaland and his protégé Nate "Danga" Hills were responsible for most of his big hits. Timberlake let the producers run wild on "FutureSex/LoveSounds," his second disc; not everybody loved the aggressive pop experiments on the album, but it completed the star’s transition from a tyro on puppet strings to an ambitious artist with a long future in the spotlight.

He said it would not have done much to bolster the financial position of the directors, or the bank’s original investors, including Lesniak, who lost everything when the bank failed.
Alex Dencker, store manager at Behnke Nurseries in Potomac, Md., has witnessed the clash of gardeners that plays out amid blossoming plants and flats of herbs at gardening centers across the country. So has his wife.

The increase at the Colorado Springs campus will be 4.9 percent, and the increase at the CU Denver campus will be 0.8 percent.
I think that the Timbers Army will grow. There may be one or two (groups). But it's not a supporters' group if it's not 100 active people, in my mind, at least. That's the minimum threshold. We'll do some things to try to facilitate, but the great thing about the army is it's really been organic in how it's grown. The only thing that I've done is really try to improve relations with the Timbers Army. And that wasn't the case with past management. And we'll continue to do that with MLS.
Thus MU's only known words on the issue this week are the angry ones of coach Gary Pinkel on St. Louis' KFNS radio Wednesday morning. After repeatedly declining to speak about realignment during his regular media sessions, Pinkel again blasted the Big 12.
After Jourdan Gouff returned the opening kickoff 77 yards for McCluer (0-2), North's Tyran Carey capped a 19-play, 65-yard drive that took 10:02 off the clock in the quarter with a 1-yard plunge to tie the contest 7-7.
The protested impediments to free speech took on unlikely forms. Silverman lambasted the refusal of an old boyfriend to be told "I love you" after six weeks of dating. Fred Armisen, Jason Sudeikis and Seth Meyers traded places in an interrogation sketch where each was guilty of offending "the Supreme Leader" — who could only be assumed to be "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels. For some, even Fozzie Bear was "the man."
It begins in darkness, with the recorded sounds of birds and water giving way to a musical evocation of the Ohlone and Miwok tribes who first inhabited the region. (Sunday's performance was introduced by two Miwok tribal leaders.) The piece unfolds in four connected movements, and subsequent episodes conjure up the excitement of the bridge's construction and offer a nod to its unhappy history as a magnet for suicides.
INTERESTING: My reaction to this movie was that most people should see it because it's funny and has a great plot line.
Kavanaugh's teammates and coaches called him "the Little General" because of his stature (he was listed at 6-feet). Ramirez has a long way to go to fill Kavanaugh's shoes as a leader and player, but the prospect of a new general leading the Vikings into battle has the team excited about its prospects next fall.

By the end of the year, the balance stood at 82 percent. Council officials say the percentage of funding has remained at or near that level ever since.
It was a particularly good night for Malin. His most recent album, “Love It To Life,” contains some of his most memorable songs, and his current band, the St. Marks Social, is his most dynamic backing group. Guitarist Todd Youth, who was in D Generation for a few years in the ’90s and has backed everyone from Glenn Danzig to Glen Campbell since then, gives Malin, for the first time in his solo career, a bandmate with as much stage presence as he has.

White Sox left-hander Chris Sale will have an MRI on his left elbow today, less than a week after manager Robin Ventura named him closer to reduce his workload from starting and perhaps reduce soreness he has had for weeks. ...
Drums pounded, trumpets blared and whistles screamed as the crowd made its way toward downtown through the East Village neighborhood, past fast-food outlets, diners, clothing stores, banks and boutiques. Some waved at people peering down from windows of their apartments. One group was dressed as a baseball team, in blue caps and white uniforms with "Tax Dodgers" written on their uniforms in the same script as the real Dodgers. They even carried baseball bats.

Still, it's possible to get too much of a good thing. And if Real and Barca tangle in Munich next month in the Champions League final, it would be their seventh meeting in less than 10 months. (Barcelona leads the season series, 3-0-2, with April 22's second La Liga game still to go.) It's like watching the Red Sox and Yankees play 19 times a season. The first couple of games are intriguing, but after that, it's like deja vu all over again.
Orlando City, which has an eight-match unbeaten streak that dates to last season, will host the Pittsburgh Riverhounds next Saturday night.
Driving 10,000 miles on electricity will use about 2,500 kilowatt-hours, or 20 percent more than the average annual consumption of U.S. homes. At an average utility rate of 11 cents per kilowatt-hour, that's $275 for a year of fuel, equivalent to about 70 cents per gallon of gasoline.
The friend herself - the one who weighed your views against other information she received, formed an opinion and chose a course of action - is ultimately responsible for breaking up with the guy, and for getting back together with him, and for doing so without sufficient courage to look her know-too-much friends in the eye.
And how is this season going?
But as school officials ticked off the list of factors they considered when deciding on driver's ed cars, safety rarely made the cut. In an era of belt-tightening, districts often place cost and fuel efficiency above crash test ratings and vehicle size — factors that experts consider when judging a car's safety.
"We didn't want to go back (to San Jose for Game 6), obviously," Perron said. "Knowing we didn't want to go back there obviously made it that much bigger."

Democratic and Republican caucuses have scheduled meetings in the next few days to work through the details of how the divided chambers would function.
That dark, antic sensibility is full-throated in "The Holy City." This time around, the setting is the fictional Cullymore, a place -- like so many in contemporary Ireland -- on its way from small town to modern bedroom suburb. That suits the novel's first-person narrator, Chris McCool, just fine because his hometown's newly minted, atomized anonymity is just the sort of cover he relishes. Now 67, Chris is (superficially, at least) happily reliving the swinging young manhood he may or may not have enjoyed in the 1960s.

The mid-Atlantic region of the East Coast is dominated by Alexandria, Va.-based architect David Jameson, who in the past year has won more than two dozen state, national and international design awards. Every building he designs has what he calls "in-between spaces," a reference to the spaces between buildings on farm compounds in rural Maryland. His Jigsaw House in Bethesda, Md., sold for nearly $2 million in June. It consists of a series of angled white stucco geometric shapes with long, narrow glass windows, built around a central courtyard (the "in-between space"). It has a kaleidoscope feel, with every room having a view of the others through the courtyard.
With the new start times, Lee has proposed the faculty at the middle and high schools will have 25 minutes every morning before students arrive to get together to discuss curriculum, hear from a speaker, or discuss any necessities pertaining to the schools and students.

But none of that matters, said Bill Glenn, managing director of The Marketing Arm, a Dallas-based marketing firm.
Ideally, Kuroda would like to nibble at the edges to get ahead and then put hitters away with a splitter out of the strike zone. But in his Yankee debut against Tampa Bay, Kuroda managed to throw just 10 of 21 four-seam fastballs for strikes. He got into counts of 0-2 or 1-2 just four times compared to being forced into six full counts, four of which led to walks. He struck out just two.
The city of 250,000 is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse places in America, and the West Point cadets are visiting as part of a class at the academy on peacekeeping and reconstruction called "Winning the Peace."

That's a massive effort for a warship that went down in Civil War history as an ironclad flop. The Civil War pitted the secessionist confederacy of pro-slavery southern states against the pro-Union northern states.
After they hit it big in wireless, the brothers started putting that name on something more tangible than cell phone towers. In quick succession in 2003 and 2004, they bought the Mayfair, the American Theater on 9th Street, and the former Board of Education building on Locust. They began planning a high-end high-rise tower like nothing their hometown had seen in years. Then they got into the hotel business, cobbling together 11 Roberts properties from Tampa to Texas.

Assigning blame can be a sensitive issue, but there's surely a lot of it to go around. Failing schools. Bad parents. Kids doing drugs. My personal favorite is television.
Prosecutors consider the group a criminal enterprise that used violence, or its threat, to protect their territory, sell drugs and terrify community members into silence.

"I am tired of groups like the Strokes who claim to be saviors of rock ’n’ roll, but who leak songs on the internet rather than breaking them on the radio. I want to get people back to remembering what it’s like to hear new music on the air, and think ‘this is different, this is cool. This is where I’ll go to find out what’s happening.’

The 2000-01 team went 30-11 (.732) at home during a 48-34 season.
The Goldwater Institute, a Phoenix-based government watchdog group, doesn't think so. The institute has successfully opposed other government subsidies; recently, it stopped Glendale from providing a large payout to a new owner for the Phoenix Coyotes hockey team.
The British kidling hit "Skins" follows the exploits of a clique of mostly mopey Bristol college students who spend so much time hooking up, drinking, drugging, brawling and bawling, it's a wonder they aren't all dropouts.
It's a mission so impossible that not even the U.S. Marines can do the job. No, this one will take — don't hold your breath — yes, One Man. The invention of the One Man Movie has been one of the handiest story devices to come along since the fruit cart. All I need do is quote two sentences from the trailer and in your mind you know exactly how the Deep-Voiced Trailer Guy sounds when he says them: "My daughter ... is on a goodwill mission on that station. There's only One Man who can get her out ... Snow!"

The mass suspension, an unprecedented step by any church leader since the clergy-sex abuse scandal exploded a decade ago, roiled Catholics across the region. Church officials scrambled to staff depleted rectories, parishioners struggled to accept the abrupt and unexplained disappearance of their pastors, and hundreds of unaccused priests banded together for support and to assert their rights to the church hierarchy.
Insulting his own team might have been both the last resort and the most fitting tactic. ESPN analyst Dan Dakich basically said Ohio State thinks it should win because, well, it was picked to win. The Buckeyes lack focus and drive, shown when they squander big leads.

So far, no one's fallen in, although visiting dogs do like to jump in. That's one of the first things that Flora, Doug the Wonder Guy's dog, did. Last weekend, Ebby, a part black Lab, took the plunge. So far, Ernie, the world's most adorable dog according to my unbiased view, hasn't shown any tendency to be a swimmer.

Veal scallopini with artichokes and a white wine sauce ($22.95) also is a just-right interpretation; not so light as to be inauthentic, but not so heavy to be overkill. Kids are well-treated, with chicken fingers ($9.95) that are real and lightly battered, and thankfully served with wholesome mashed potatoes.
Mark Reynolds, who is in a 3-for-31 slump, was not in the starting lineup Tuesday. The slugger hit .143 with a .206 slugging percentage in 19 April games. It was the first time in his career he hasn't homered in April and his first full month without a homer since September 2010.

In a bleak assessment that added urgency to the president's speech, the White House budget office on Thursday predicted that without new polices unemployment will remain at 9 percent next year. It also projected overall growth this year at just 1.7 percent, a full percentage point less than the administration predicted at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, the budget office review said that the projected deficit for the year ending Sept. 30 will be $1.3 trillion, $300 billion less than it projected in February.

"What I contest (in the fiscal pact) is that there isn't a single growth component, which means that we're imposing a generalized austerity on countries," he said at Wednesday's debate. "And so we will be forever condemned to austerity, and what's more, the deficit level will never recede."
