Sometimes it's hard to keep reminding yourself that Marleau is the Sharks' all-time leader in game-winning playoff goals (13) as well as in career playoff points (88).

Food stamps are just one of the cuts Republicans want to muscle through the House as a follow-up to the GOP budget plan approved last month. That measure is nonbinding but instructed six House committees to come up with spending reductions as an alternative to across-the-board cuts scheduled to slam both the Pentagon and domestic agencies in January.

Jean-Georges Steakhouse from Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of New York's most lauded chefs, has a low-key glamour, with an open floor plan, caramel leather banquettes and a wall motif based on the shape of a cow's nose, of all things.

Yes, lawyers are behind a lot of this. Excessive tests are often ordered because doctors are understandably so afraid of lawsuits. But tests and treatment can have risks, too. For instance, a CT scan is routinely done for head bumps, even when no internal injury is suspected, "just to be sure" things are fine. Such scans, judiciously used, can be lifesaving. But they deliver radiation hundreds of times or more than that of a dental X-ray. And a study just out in the journal Cancer says that overexposure to even dental scans may be linked to a certain brain cancer.

When I wake up in the morning, the day before I am to leave Spain, I find an email with news. A table had been found for me at El Bulli that evening, at 6:30 sharp.

The top prospects: Alabama's Courtney Upshaw, who had 9.5 sacks in 2011, would be a great fit for the Ravens, who may have to replace outside linebacker Jarret Johnson. The problem is that Upshaw is the top outside linebacker in April’s NFL draft and will likely be gone in the first 20 picks. He has good speed and range for a guy who is 273 pounds and he can hold up against the run. North Carolina's Zach Brown, a former standout at Wilde Lake, has great sideline-to-sideline speed and will be on the rise if he runs well in Indy. Oklahoma's Ronnell Lewis and Nebraska's Lavonte David are also among the top outside linebackers in the draft.

The script, adapted by Sarah Phelps, is trim but adequate, and there are some fine performances, by such stalwarts as Suchet; Ray Winstone as Magwitch, the escaped prisoner; and Shaun Dooley as Joe. Mark Addy ("Game of Thrones") plays Uncle Pumblechook convincingly without quite hitting that singularly Dickensian way of blending comedy and greed in a secondary character. And full-lipped Booth does what he can with Pip. More often than not, Booth seems half asleep, but who could blame him?

Maybe George hires Ira because he’s so depressed by his medical news that he thinks Ira is funny, though he is not. Maybe the point of Ira’s unfunniness, and all the unfunniness to come, is that comics are lonely, desperate people (George certainly fills the bill), or that the state of contemporary stand-up is lamentable—a point that the movie drives home, whether intentionally or not, with a succession of comedy scenes distinguished only by the repetitiveness and impoverishment of their scatology.

Six years ago, lawmakers got really worried about the voracious and ever-growing infestation of business tax credits and exemptions embedded deep in the bowels of Connecticut's tax system.

​The blue — and white — collar gathering place in downtown Newark cops, firemen, office workers and others pack in here, especially on Friday nights.

It's got a good director, Peter Segal. Wonderful director. The writers were great. The producers were young and aggressive and smart. But the brilliance is Steve Carell.

School supplies empower education."

“No feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others. As in previous moments of national danger, we Americans are all in the same boat. If we drift, quarreling and paralyzed, over a Niagara of debt, we will all suffer, regardless of income, race, gender, or other category. If we fail to shift to a pro-jobs, pro-growth economic policy, there will never be enough public revenue to pay for our safety net, national security, or whatever size government we decide to have.

Judd is a successful, famous actress who has talent and beauty (yes, still) and has used both to her advantage. Her appearance was objectively on the table when she got leading roles in movies, scored cosmetics campaigns and appeared on the covers of fashion magazines. When Judd or any other actor -- male or female -- strolls down a red carpet in thousands of dollars of borrowed clothes and jewels, they’ve been objectified into a powerful advertisement for the designers who bedeck them. For Judd to be outraged that the same public that is awed by her looks -- a currency for her -- will chortle about cracks in the glossy facade seems to indicate she doesn’t understand how the game she signed up for, and has prospered from, is played. Interestingly, there is a bit of fairness in this brutal game: Only the beautiful are picked on. The stars who seem to be given a pass are the ones who start out with a deficit -- no homely or truly overweight actress is ever trashed on the red carpet. And if they do choose an outfit that manages to make them look decent, they are fervently applauded by fashion critics.

Well, no ... I didn't know if red truly got monkeys excited - bright-bottomed baboons perhaps, but maybe not dignified silver-furred macaques. However, because macaques are trichromatic - meaning they can distinguish colors - it was a distinct possibility ... So, I'm not quite sure what possessed me to don the red coral necklace. But I did; I thought I'd found a way to hide it beneath the collar of my shirt.
For fans of aerial displays, this spring game hit the mark. The two quarterbacks combined to complete 40 of 55 passes for 443 yards (Miller was 24 of 31 for 258; Guiton 16 of 24 for 185), and each threw an interception. And get this: Meyer thought both could have been sharper. He wants Miller to be more accurate. And Guiton’s interception, which came on a fourth-quarter drive that could have given the Gray the lead, was the result of being late, which Meyer said is Guiton’s primary problem. Both worked from four- and five-wide sets most of the day, and threw from the pocket, on the rollout or scrambling, while operating a no-huddle, up-tempo offense. It featured myriad crossing patterns, including the lone TD pass, from Guiton to Devin Smith on a deep route that set Smith free to catch and run.
Woods, who has been a defensive presence for the Ducks all season, broke out against the Buffs with a career-high 14 points. At the time, it seemed like an out-of-body experience for the junior transfer, who was averaging just six points a game going into the Pac-12 tournament.
"This is my eighth startup," Nguyen said. "And I think every single one of them finished in a different place than where they started."
The end of service comes as United is finishing its merger with Continental. The new airline, called United, has a heavy flight schedule to the islands out of nearby Los Angeles International Airport.
The NJPP report gave the example of Sugar House, a 65-unit tax-abated condominium. The report says that in 2007, condo owners there paid a total of $695,477, 95 percent of it going to Jersey City. But if they had paid conventional taxes, they would have paid more than twice that — $1,627,108, with $746,477 going to the city.
"What made 'War Horse' so special was that it was a combination of everything I'd done before with horses all put into one movie," Lovgren said in an interview from New Mexico, where he is working on the Disney film "The Lone Ranger," starring Johnny Depp. "It's the biggest horse movie I've ever done."
When he returned to the lineup at the beginning of April after sitting out with an upper-body injury, Pyatt believed he could do more for the Coyotes.

One student reported that he “enjoyed the program because it increased his knowledge about real life jobs – particularly the Eyewitness News Team!” Another said the biomedical engineer’s presentation made him more interested in exploring a career in medicine.

Haribo of America sees even more untapped demand. From offices off Security Boulevard where visitors are greeted by life-size images of Haribo's logo, a gold bear in red bow tie, Haribo is building its brand with a TV ad campaign, expanding its reach in stores and dreaming up new versions of the snack that once came in just five flavors — lemon, orange, strawberry, pineapple and raspberry.
But if you're a fan of a stout V-12 engine (you are, trust me), this car will be heard in Sport mode. Put that transmission in manual mode and wait for the engine to crest that 3,700-rpm threshold and you (and those within a city block of you) are treated to a malevolent trumpeting not unlike the brass section in an orchestra from hell. What adds to the enjoyment of this aural conflagration is how the motor in this DBS maintains its British sensibilities and doesn't scream and thrash like a high-strung motor from Italy might.
Here's the bottom line that no amount of fuming from critics who wish Cleveland Browns Stadium had never been built on the lakefront -- and on the taxpayer's dime -- or from anguished fans upset by 13 seasons of almost uninterrupted disappointment can change: The city of Cleveland owns the stadium and has a responsibility to maintain its asset.

Pro basketball hadn't evaporated completely from Hoosier minds, but it wasn't at the forefront. The research firm Scarborough Sports Marketing asked people in the Indianapolis region for their thoughts on the NBA from August 2010 to September 2011. More than 40 percent said they had some interest, which was the 12th-most out of the 77 markets surveyed. But the number of "very interested," 7 percent, was a measly 53rd.

I don't think it's a close call, though. Her using these controlling tactics carries her across the boundary into your business. That's solid justification for calling her out on your behalf (whenever she does it). And, unless she changes her ways, she'll send loved ones scurrying from her just as you two have withdrawn emotionally from your parents. That's justification for butting in on her behalf (once).
Kind says fortunately no one was in the cabin when it caught fire.
In Mozart's Sonata in B-flat major, K. 454, Perlman employed too much vibrato, slid into notes and occasionally tip-toed around pitch. The performance had welcome vitality and, in the slow movement's poetic lines, elasticity. But Mozart's eloquent interaction of instruments lacked penetrating treatment. De Silva's pianism was efficient and not always on the button.
As an alternative, Hamlin and others have been trying to build alternative identity lockers that allow us to create and manage elements of our digital identity outside the walls of any single company.

Mischoulon says many researchers are now focusing on 5-MTHF, or L-methylfolate. Folate is needed to make the brain chemicals dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine, and L-methylfolate is the only form of folate that can cross the blood-brain barrier. That means a smaller dose of L-methylfolate may be able to exert the same effect as a much larger dose of folate. (Mischoulon is conducting a clinical trial of a commercial form of L-methylfolate called Deplin; the trial is supported by Pamlab, Deplin's maker.)

That theme carries through to the other titles in this collection, when Ruben and his brother start boxing for money in "Fighting Ruben Wolfe," and when Cameron pursues the affection of his brother's cast-off love interest in "Getting the Girl." No one in the Wolfe family is a winner. The members of this seven-person blue-collar clan are merely survivors, Cameron observes, whether it's his plumber dad, his wash-woman mom or Cameron and Ruben, who stave off the boredom of underemployment and the restlessness of youth with brawls and other up-to-no-good activities.

"Most people only dream," Smith said. "I not only had my childhood dream, I did everything I could to fulfill it."
Third, some House leaders want to begin laying the foundation for entitlement reform, since large, unfunded entitlement commitments are the main cause of the American fiscal crisis. But this approach splits the Republican conference, with some members asserting it is premature and politically damaging. Even supporters of raising the issue think in incremental terms. While America may have the Greek economic disease, the worst symptoms are not immediate. "We are not at the austerity stage yet," one House member told me. "We still have time to change on our own terms." The hope of entitlement-reform advocates is to spend two years preparing the public -- demonstrating that scaling back benefits is possible without removing the safety net, building alliances with centrist Democrats and ensuring that the 2012 Republican presidential candidate is supportive.

Don't give small amounts to a lot of charities. The smaller the donation, the less return on a charity's investment. To make up for that, charities sell or rent lists of small donors to others, said Sandra Miniutti, a vice president at Charity Navigator, which evaluates nonprofits. Charities don't divulge mid- to high-level donors' personal information to others, Miniutti said, because they're too valuable to risk losing.

The Yogyakarta region, with a population of about 3 million, is the only Indonesian province still ruled by a sultan, a special status recognizing the role the region played in the war for independence against the Dutch. The city is now home to several major Indonesian universities, which gives it a smart, young air. But its center remains Sultan Hamengkubuwono's palace (or kraton), a walled, whitewashed compound with open-air pavilions. A 175-piece gamelan orchestra, an ensemble of wind, string and percussion, performs here. It has its own bank, a 2,500-man military garrison, a museum of mostly hideous gifts given to sultans, 20 vehicles in the royal garage and 75 bird cages.

But political scientists have found that past elections have been more influenced by the changes in the economy in the year or two before the election. And a range of economic data provided by Moody's Analytics shows that all nine states are rebounding and that most now have unemployment rates below the national average. If voters in those states begin to feel the improvement by the fall, it could aid the president's efforts to hold on to enough of them to win a second term.
It had to be the recipe, when you look at some of the projects that come forth, and try to sneak things by, we had a very long process with the site, financial package, working in the city, making sure the environmental impact report came back so that it enhances the community as opposed to took away from the community. We didn't like taking any shortcuts. It might be frustrating at the time but when it's all said and done it makes it a better project. You're better doing that work on the front end and reap the benefits over the next 50 years.

People who write apps are motivated by the revenue they're likely to get. They can maximize that revenue by focusing on the tablet computer that is owned by the largest number of people.
The Bears are not in a position to give up a first round draft pick. They have an aging roster. In the last three years the Bears have added one first round pick (Gabe Carimi) and one second round pick (Stephen Paea). If anything, they need to find a way to get more high picks, not fewer. I like Wallace a lot, but I would rather have two good young players than one.

A: A Texas ebony, Pithecellobium flexicaule, is native to the lower coastal savannah of south Texas. It can survive to the lower 20s and is suited to the lower deserts only. I would suggest planting a hybrid live oak. "Heritage" is a selection of Quercus fusiformis and Quercus virginiana. It has beautiful dark evergreen leaves and would do well in your higher-elevation garden.
Maybe with the date still far away, the fiscal cliff just doesn't seem real. It's certainly being treated that way on both sides of the political divide. On the left, economists claim with a straight face that even huge tax hikes don't matter—a top tax rate as high as 70%, they claim, would have no chilling effects on top earners' incentives. On the right, they just as solemnly claim even a small rise in the top rate for high earners from today's 35% to the 39.6% scheduled for after year-end will bring about economic ruin.

Households making between $60,000 and $100,000 paid on average 8% of their income in federal incomes taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Stand Up Paddle (SUP) is all about having fun, kind of how surfing used to be before it began to get so popular, the surf spots getting crazy crowded, the "I have to be the only one on this wave" mentality and the little or no toleration for other surfers. What happened to the Love? Do we surf, however we chose to do it, because we love it? Or is it because we don't know why but are driven, for unfathomable reasons, to be there as often as possible, to ride waves but willing to lower ourselves to any level to accomplish that?

As the banking industry accepted billions in government bailout funds last fall, life insurers aggressively lobbied for their own piece of the federal aid, worried about their balance sheets, which had been saddled by hefty investment losses from the declines in the stock market.

When the congressional districts were redrawn last year to reflect population changes detailed in the U.S. census, Schwarz's home base of Battle Creek was moved into the new 3rd District.

Maybe because the recession revealed a major blind spot in our smart-growth strategy: Making stuff look good, making neighborhoods more livable, does not automatically translate into job creation. If you need proof that urban renewal isn't enough, stay aboard the streetcar as it winds down to South Waterfront, where high-priced condos have been downgraded to affordable apartments and promised high-tech jobs haven't materialized.
"It's very much out of character for the U.S. to embrace this type of suspicion-less surveillance," says Marc Rotenberg, EPIC's executive director. "But instead of branding it as part of a police state, let's simply put an end to it."

As critics have pointed out many times, Tressel could have reported the players as soon as he found out about the violations in March 2010 and did not. He could have told the truth on the preseason rules compliance form he signed in September and did not. He could have come clean at the December news conference and did not. He could have benched the guilty players for the Sugar Bowl and did not.

Interestingly, my kids do not react this way. I have observed both my kids accept apologies, in the "light" form of negative behavior ceasing, and move on. Joe once said to me, "Mom! I've moved on. Yeah, the guy is a jerk, but I'm not." During the same school year, I saw Jessie offer kindness to someone who had not treated her that way. When I asked about it in a roundabout way, Jessie shrugged, "She needed help. I had the homework."

"At 17, 19 or 20, you don't know what your future holds," Mielock said. "I am not against tattoos or self-expression, but other people are going to form perceptions of you based on these things. I recommend if you're going to get a tattoo, get it where you can cover it up."
Even if that hurdle is overcome, for three years the receiving district can opt to keep the new students' test scores separate, not allowing them to impact the overall rankings. It's an understandable precaution to gain support for the new configuration, but it also gives the suburban districts a grace period with no accountability. At what point would these children's achievement really become anyone's responsibility?
The 63-year-old Minneapolis real estate agent still lands in the occasional sand trap, but it no longer bothers him -- at least not on a physical level. After trying everything from arthroscopic surgery to cortisone shots to lubricant injections, he finally opted to have both knees replaced, the left one in December 2007 and the right one three months later. His knee replacements "worked out so well that now I'm encouraging everyone who has problems to do it as soon as the problems start to impede their ability to do things normally," he said.
The menu is very large and tries to please everyone, which is potentially a bad thing. There are, however, some bright spots. I ordered "Mongolian delight" extra-hot, and found the spiciness worked well with the mixed vegetables. All that seasoning tended to hide the worst parts of the Loving Hut way of cooking  the soy products. Here, it was thinly sliced and less conspicuous among the green onion, bell peppers and Mongolian sauce.
That message was good to hear. That week, my wife and I had been working toward a major decision that affected both of our careers. The reality of our decision, however, hit hard in the hours before I gave notice at work.

As a columnist at a daily newspaper, I have no need to place calls to radio programs. I've got my own platform, thank you. But the other day, while driving, I heard a comment on an afternoon talk show that nearly prompted me to pull over, pick up my phone, and launch into a tirade. Happily, I restrained myself, opting for a moment of reflection instead.
Outfield addition
Every bit the bulldog he was as a reliever, Lynn rifled through the Milwaukee Brewers in the Cardinals' 9-3 victory at Miller Park. Lynn struck out eight, held the Brewers' to a solo homer through his 6 2/3 innings of work, and allowed only two hits. He threw 100 pitches, and he unnerved Milwaukee with a mix of heat and benders that led to three called third-strike Ks.
You can be sure that Chicago mayors do see it as a demotion. Only one has ever stooped down to the Governor's Mansion and that was almost a century ago: ex-Mayor Edward Fitzsimmons Dunne served as governor from 1913-17.

Jobs will loom large in next year's elections and GOP presidential hopefuls, who debated each other Wednesday night in California, are doing their own jockeying. After former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney unveiled a business-friendly 160-page economic plan on Tuesday, Texas Gov.

His backers in the recording sessions were the very nonfiction crew of guitarist Terry Eason, bassist James Everest and drummer Erik Mathison, all of whom will join him for Saturday's pair of release shows at Bryant-Lake Bowl. Pedal-steel maestro Joe Savage and Hastings 3000's Joe Hastings also joined the sessions. Hicks points to them as proof he took the recording project as seriously as any of his albums -- and perhaps even put more pressure on himself.
The Japanese are presented as sadistic fanatics who make Klingons seem lax on questions of honor. Jun-shik is pressed into their army (echoing a scene in Kang's earlier “Tae Guk Gi: Brotherhood of War,” but with greater brutality here), where a “Bansai!”-screaming Tatsuo is the vindictive colonel. Jun-shik proves his stamina and bravery but, like the others, is captured by Soviet troops and sent to a POW camp in Siberia.
4. The Lakers need to limit the Spurs' three-point shooting. Meanwhile, the Lakers haven't allowed teams to crack the 100-point barrier in four of the past five games. The Lakers likely won't face issues covering the post. But they've shown a lack of discipline in closing out on the perimeter. In the past five games, the Lakers have allowed teams to average a 50% clip from three-point range. It didn't haunt them last week when San Antonio shot 13-of-24 from downtown. But it's hardly worth taking the risk again.

But a 600-page report released Thursday by the Passaic River Basin Flood Advisory Commission disputed the claims by Saranovic and many of her neighbors.

Even lunch sandwiches here are special: a hamburger on focaccia bread with mustard greens or slivers of roast pork with chili mayonnaise on homemade bread with an undercurrent of sweetness.
"Without a doubt (fumbling troubles) is what I would say," Ridley said today. Patriots coach Bill Belichick "didn't have to say it. The coaches hadn't said anything about it, to be honest, but I know as a player there's a reason why. I know what I did. When you go back and look at your game film and you look over yourself, you can find your mistakes if you're a good player."

"Cake Boss" Buddy Valastro considered Picinich to be a second father and teared up as he praised a man he had known his entire life.
The chilling figures come the morning after Obama called for a five-year freeze on domestic agency budgets passed by Congress each year. But those nondefense programs make up just 18 percent of the $3.7 trillion budget, which means any upcoming deficit reduction package -- at least one that begins to significantly slow the gush of red ink -- will require politically dangerous curbs to popular benefit programs, which include Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid health care program for the poor and disabled, and food stamps.
The four-day trip to Madrid comes after Adams and representatives from the Portland Development Commission toured the company's local offices for two hours Thursday, meeting with President Ralph Currey.

This place is so different from anything else out there, you almost have to check out. It's a dueling-pianos club, but let's be real, everyone sings along. The upside is it's a group sing, so none of those embarrassing moments happen when you forget lyrics or realize you chose the wrong karaoke song (a Lil Wayne rap, perhaps?). On Fridays and Saturdays, pianos start at 7 p.m. and there's no cover before then (it's $8 after). Sundays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, pianos start at 8 p.m. The ivory ticklers have Mondays and Tuesdays off, when comedians take the stage.

Oh yeah, it happens all the time. I know in the past, it was a taboo thing. I think today people are pretty open-minded ... I would say obviously, dating someone who's Catholic, it's easier to relate things from your past. You can share things that you both can nod and laugh about. Somebody who's a Methodist might go, "Why is that so funny?"

"I participated in the Parma gun buyback. What a terrible, poorly planned program. A line of cars went forever and never moved. After over an hour and a half waiting in line I finally made it to the front of the line. I was told they ran out of gift cards and it would be another 20-minute wait. When they were delivered there was no one there to receive them. The actual transaction took less than 3 minutes. I was out of the house for over 2 hours, and I live just a few blocks away from the justice center where it took place. I was given a card for a $1,000 drawing along with the gift card. And was told to go online to action19news.com. On Sunday I could not find that number of the winning ticket after looking at everything on the website. No number appeared and people were writing online that they could not find the number of the winning ticket. What a joke. It is the most ridiculous thing I have ever done, and I certainly won't do it again."

After five hours of public testimony and a 4-1 City Council vote to keep officers in the task force (with Hales now opposed), critics turned their backs or walked out of City Hall as politicians tried to explain.

May 2: In 1983 the longest jury trial in San Diego history ended after 21 months when Fotomat Corp. settled out of court to pay $10 million to 23 Southern California franchise holders who had accused the corporation of violating antitrust laws.
