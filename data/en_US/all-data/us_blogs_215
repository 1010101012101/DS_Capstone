For the first time in Angela’s life, health issues were becoming a major problem. Angela did not like to ask – from anyone! As age and health became more of an issue in Angela’s life, she was beginning to realize she needed more help.

'Escapology' is currently one of my favourite pieces for a couple of reasons, it was created without any planning, no theme in mind, and no direction as to where I wanted to go with it, a process that I normally don't do. It kind of just happened. However, once finished and I was looking over the piece it suddenly struck me that this assemblage that was born out of sheer frustration had so much personal meaning for me that it was quite scary. 'Escapology' had unbeknown to me resulted in the portrayal of a disability that I have called Fibromyalgia. A lot of my work centres around my health and personal issues but for me to create this with no conscious intention of doing so and for it to be so symbolic for me really was a strange experience. Just goes to show that art really does express what is within us, whether it be consciously or sub-consciously.
I created en eventhandler that should be triggered on ItemUpdated on my Pages library. What the eventhandler did isn’t important in this context but I should mention that it didn’t change anything with the involving item (page) so .DisableEventFiring(); wasn’t an issue. The problem was that every time I opened my page, selected edit page, did some changes and clicked publish my event handler was activated 3 times ?!?!
Dear Pond Group Leaders,
It has been a busy couple of months! Lots of things to take care of and now I am off for a much needed visit with my parents and family in San Diego. My niece is getting married on Saturday at the Disneyland Hotel :) How fun to get married at the "happiest place on earth"..lol!

Strangely enough, when I backpacked around Europe I broke my four-coffee-a-day addiction and grew to absolutely detest people smoking – apparently I got it all backwards and was supposed to return an espresso connoisseur and smoking like a chimney. But back in Melbourne I found myself hooked on green tea; as a past barista the idea was pretty foreign to me, but I grew to love the wonderful feeling you get after drinking a cup of green tea. It’s almost like a clean and cleansed feeling, and I have never gone back. Nowadays I frequent T2 and on one occasion, spent $36 on green teas in a matter of minutes. This Easter my mum gave me Mint Vanilla and Relaxation Lavender instead of chocolate. No regrets.
Dates for Derek and I have changed over the past 3 years or so. Maybe evolved is a better way to put it? At the beginning Derek would bring me to his baseball and hockey games (trying to impress me I assume) and then we would hang out in a parking lot drinking lukewarm cans of Coor’s Light with his team before heading to some dive pub for greasy food (I hope he didn’t think this impressed me!)
When we got to Adam's place, he wasn't ready yet, so we went up to his flat. I was panicking a little bit because I know we're gonna be late for the film and I'm going to miss the trailers at the beginning! But oh well, never mind...
Notice how much of the conservative-progressive division is a result of the particulars of Korean history, rather than the policy preferences more regularly seen in other democracies. To be sure, policy preferences along the camp lines do exist in Korea. Like conservatives of many other countries, Korea's conservatives tend to prefer lower taxes and pro-business policies. Like leftists of many other countries, Korea's progressives tend to prefer more active intervention of the government in the market and distributive taxation policies. But these policy preferences are not the only driving purpose of Korea's political camps. Although one could argue that this is true in the politics of all countries, it is worth pointing out that policy preferences of each parties are not set in stone, and can change unexpectedly based on their historical roots as well as the realities of contemporary politics.
Here’s the part I wanted to share: when they got up to leave the whole restaurant began to clap and it got louder and louder. The waitresses and hostess were lined up to wish them well. The two Sushi chefs came out from their work stations and were standing along side of the other workers. They all bowed as the couple walked by. People in the restaurant offered comments out loud, “you look gorgeous”, “have fun”, “enjoy”, “drive safe”, “be careful driving”, “dance until your feet hurt”…….the owner of the restaurant thanked them very much for celebrating at their restaurant. Both the boy and the girl were blushing and smiling. Big, huge, happy smiles. They held hands as they walked through the restaurant and out the door. Things quieted down, really quiet after they left. Through the windows you could see them walking towards his dad’s car. Every one in the restaurant was hoping, HOPING, using esp and HOPING that he opened the door for her……………………

MAGIC MIKE (June 29) – You can’t say Steven Soderbergh ever does the same thing twice. a semi-biographical tale of Channing Tatum’s own life as a male stripper is the plot of this movie which also stars Matthew McConaughey and Alex Pettyfer. Considering this is a Soderbergh film, it could be something quite unique or more like Ocean’s 12.

EVERYTHING but the problem at hand.

Now, I grew up with Kevin Conroy as the voice of the animated Batman from Batman: The Animated Series on through to Justice League Unlimited. I own all those series and movies featuring his voice as the Dark Knight. I even hear his voice when I read Batman in any comic book. However, Bruce Greenwood was tapped to voice Bruce Wayne / Batman here, and I was not at all disappointed or put off by it. Greenwood inhabits the tone of both the character and the story excellently. Much credit is to be given to screenwriter Judd Winick for capturing the essence of Batman here, but Greenwood slips into the proverbial cape and cowl smoothly. In true Batman style, he expresses his heart in subtle, brief moments. Similarly, John DiMaggio absorbs himself into the Joker. At first, I wasn’t entirely certain if I was hearing veteran Joker voice actor Mark Hamill or not, but DiMaggio brings a deeper voice to the microphone that makes Batman’s archenemy more unsettling. He’s a little darker, more Heath Ledger like in his portrayal, but still delivering the exuberant insanity that Hamill was a master at. It is a very appropriate portrayal for this darker edged story.

There is no such thing as medical aid in the UK. There are ‘health plans‘ for the elite, but the advertising for these plans is along the lines of “Buy our health plan, and you’ll be able to jump the queue”. It’s not a case of better care, and the health plans are all optional. If you don’t have a medical aid, you will not get worse treatment or care. Schools: Schooling is free for all. Not “Oh, if you can afford it we’ll charge you school fees” free, like in South Africa, but it is free. Gratis, no charge - for ALL people. You can opt for a paid-for private school, but my experience is that more problems are bred in the private school systems anyway. The standard of education, like everywhere in the world, is not as high as it used to be, but it’s THERE. If you are a single parent, the government will help you with child-care costs if you are working. If you choose to be a stay-at-home single parent, the government will make sure you can survive in relative comfort.

Believe it or not, the same distinction does not apply in Britain, however, the effect is the same, as we all know, the police and crown prosecution service would rather crawl over red hot coals than charge a non-white person with a racially motivated crime against a white person. The terrible killing of Kriss Donald was an exception only because the authorities could not deny the racial motive of his killers, who went out looking for a white boy, snatched an innocent child from the street and tortured him to death for no reason other than the colour of his skin.

Earlier this month, Wisconsin Judge Patrick J. Fiedler issued a response to the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund regarding the Constitutionality of food rights. In his response, Judge Fiedler stated “Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to consume the milk from their own cow.” He then went further stating, “Plaintiffs do not have a fundamental right to produce and consume the foods of their choice.”

It was not easy for him to go. As a former in ring performer he was a little uncomfortable. He believes that it looks bad to be at a show when you are not on the card. He called it being a locker room loser. To avoid this we kept a low profile and he stayed away from the backstage. Just before we went in he said: "tonight I'm just a fan." I agreed, but I knew he had slipped his old ring gear into the back of my van.
He showed us we were wrong.

A few years ago I said that I had to see Dave Matthews live before I die. I loved everything the guy did, even the (with hindsight) patchy solo stuff. I bought loads of live DMB CDs, I must have about ten different versions of “Ants Marching” in my collection (still a beautiful song). I did actually get to see him live with Tim Reynolds in Amsterdam and it was one of the best concerts of my life. I remember once reading about ‘the black paradox of the human existence, that the satisfaction of the desire is also the death of the desire’. After that Dave Matthews concert I stopped loving his music in the same way and now he would became just a favourite artist and joined the likes of The Cure in the ‘formerly loved’ box.

Caroline Fryar, whose endless sock-knitting I ploughed through bemusedly, and whose enthusiasm for spinning I sympathised with, turned a hard left from academia. Destined for postgraduate research in all manner of classics and ancient Greek and linguistics, Caroline happened upon her plan B of ditching university to be a shepherdess. Having innocently found her blog while searching ‘knitting,’ and seeing that she described herself most prominently as ‘farm manager,’ my curiosity was piqued—how did she get here? The answer is simply this: She saw an ad. She applied for the job. She got it, and, brushing off the constant questioning of ‘aren’t you wasting your education? your brilliant mind?’ accepted it.

The past few batches before this one I had been working at least one, sometimes two decoctions into the mash regime. I am a fan of decoction, especially in lighter styles like pilsner where I think the subtleties the process produces have plenty of room to shine. For this batch however I just didn't feel like bothering with all the extra effort so I put together a simple recipe calling for just a single infusion mash with a small amount of specialty grains for a little depth of malt character and body.
The sore spot of Kant's critical philosophy has gradually become visible even to dull eyes: Kant no longer has a right to his distinction "appearance" and "thing-in-itself"--he had deprived himself of the right to go on distinguishing in this old familiar way, in so far as he rejected as impermissible making inferences from phenomena to a cause of phenomena--in accordance with his conception of causality and its purely intra-phenomenal validity-- which conception, on the other hand, already anticipates this distinction, as if the "thing-in-itself" were not only inferred but given.

I'll own that there was a relatively brief stretch when we were something like a cohesive country. For an arbitrary start date, I'll say 1900, when the War generation was mostly gone and personal memories of Reconstruction, so-called, were fading. The great immigration tide, which transformed the demography of the North, yet consisted largely of Europeans who came here to become Americans.

Of course, a lot of Brookfield’s suggestions are impractical for me at the moment, particularly anything using the lenses of our students’ eyes and our colleagues’ experiences; until I have a teaching position again, I have neither students nor colleagues. This is one reason I decided to invest in my own copy, so I would be able to refer back to some of the really quite excellent suggestions for getting inside students’ heads and finding out how they are perceiving the class. In particular, Brookfield devotes a whole chapter to discussing the Critical Incident Questionnaire (or CIQ); students anonymously fill this out at the end of the last class of each week, noting what they felt most engaged with in class over the past week, what they felt most distanced from, what action they found most affirming, what action they found most puzzling, and what about class surprised them the most. At the start of the next week, the teacher reports back on the responses and the trends they illustrated, and opens discussion about any serious issues that have turned up as group issues.

I'm back from my holiday vacation and beginning work on a couple of new webisodes for January. In the meantime, I thought I'd answer another question I've received by email. A number of people were curious which anatomy books I was referring to in Webisode 1, Part 2. They were "Artistic Anatomy" by Dr. Paul Richer and "Human Anatomy for Artists" by Eliot Goldfinger. While I do refer to other anatomy books, these two are what I rely on most often. Goldfinger's book is most valuable to me as an encyclopedia of anatomy. If I want to identify something quickly I always turn there first. Richer's book is where I look when I want to see the various anatomic components beautifully integrated in the French Academic tradition. Richer's plates are all beautiful and inspiring. Together, these books answer most of my anatomy questions.

I was about ten years old and I was visiting my cousins at their house. I don't remember why but my uncle (uncle-doctor to be exact) had put up a blue sheet in their front yard to take some pictures of something. He coaxed each of the children to let him take a picture of us individually. I remember thinking that I had a great outfit on (I was wearing GUESS hand-me-downs from one of my cool older cousins), so I was in good shape to have my picture taken. When it came my turn, I quickly ran my fingers through my hair and made sure to pull some hair forward because my mom had taught me that that was pretty. I put my hands on my hips and gave the best smile that I could.
I’m friendly, and in being outgoing, sociable and reasonably affectionate towards the people I care about (gender irrelevant, for the record), many people judge me for being a flirt (read: slut) or misconstrue my feelings towards them.

Another common belief is to regularly partake of the so-called Holy Communion. This, to many, is called an ordinance, a sacrament, or a means of grace. They say it is commanded, so we are under distinct obligation. Again there is disagreement for some reject the wine in favour of unfermented grape juice. There is disagreement as to the frequency of it. Still others limit its partaking to members of the local assembly only.
Ventilated roofs are characterised by a ventilated air space between the between-rafter insulation and the underside of the sarking felt. Ventilated roofs differ from unventilated roofs in their different types of sarking. Traditional sarking, or high resistance (HR), sarking felt is usually based upon a bitumen compound and is impervious to transmission of air and moisture. In a ventilated roof, any moisture is evaporated into the ventilated air space and passed to the outside. A ‘Breathable’, or low resistance (LR), sarking membrane on the other hand, transmits any moisture-laden air through its fabric, whilst preventing water penetrating in the reverse direction.

There's little difference between his look before and the look he has now other than the pain of hunger and no desire to drink. It doesn't hurt when he walks and his vision's clear . . he can smell others in the vicinity; company, people like him, things like him. Now there are six, seven if you include the mightily confused naked prostitute who's still bitchin' about someone else wearing her denim skirt and tank top . . . and her watch. Not quite a zombie infestation but it has the makings.
Still in sewing mode: I couldn’t go to our final rowing presentation dinner without appropriately coloured attire. I didn’t have a dress or skirt that would have been comfy and warm so I grabbed trousers, a slinky little sleeveless t-shirt top and a jacket. They were all right as far as colour was concerned, but they were all the same colour and we do have the choice of black and white and grey, or just black and white if we can’t do much else. I decided that a scarf would be a good way to add a bit of colour. I didn’t have one, so I made one. In my stash I had a large piece of fabric I’d probably intended to use for a top. Some might argue that its background colour is not really white but rather cream. The flowers and stripes are black. In the dim light of the function centre, it was black-and-white enough to be obvious that I was aiming in the right direction.

The research team, led by Professor Jeremy Henley and Dr Jack Mellor from Bristols Medical School, has identified a protein, known as SUMO, responsible for controlling the chemical processes which reduce or enhance protection mechanisms for nerve cells in the brain.

The KISS method is one to keep in mind for just about any presentation, be it a live, verbal presentation, or a written missive for anyone, anywhere to read. Focus right in on what you want to say and make it as clear and concise as possible. Like a cover letter or resume, the person reading it may not get past the first line, so get the important info done up front. A journalist visited my 7th grade classroom once and said that when writing an article, you had to cover the 5Ws in the first paragraph, preferably the first sentence: Who, What, When, and Where — if those are addressed well, then they should collectively cover the “Why” (that is, Why are you sending this press release?). The rest of the press release is for fleshing this out: again, KISS! Keep it clear & concise.

I know that sounds silly but I haven't really taken my course very seriously so far, mainly because it's the course I have to do if I want a degree at the end of all this. I've been using it more to ease myself back into regular study and it's been useful for that. But the other day I got serious about it. I signed up for my next two courses. Two 60 pointer Level 2 courses, starting in September. This is it, once these start I'll be a serious student. Full time job, technically full time student and part time karate instructor, AND trying to write a book? Something is going to give! But I want to try to do this. I have to go full pelt at it, otherwise, like everything else I try, it'll fizzle out. Besides, at this point the book is a series of notes and an idea.

I made a size 4 for the top part then fanned it out to a more generous A-line starting at the waist. I prefer my dresses to be at-or-below knee length when it's too hot to wear tights, for modesty reasons but also because I hate when my legs stick to chairs or leather car seats in 90-degree heat. This dress is about 40 inches from shoulder raw edge to hem raw edge. Ehh, yeah, that sure was a lot of stripes to match at the side seams.

Tyndall took over Morehead State in 2006, inheriting a squad that finished 4-23 the previous year. Tyndall immediately made his mark on the school, improving the team’s win total in each of his first five years.

Musical Blankets: Each child brought a blanket so we laid them out in a circle. As music played, they walked around the blankets. When the music stopped, they found a blanket and snuggled into it. For 4-year-olds, I did not take a blanket out; we just repeated. For older children, you would want to play the classic way.

I saw a film that surprisingly impressed me this weekend. That film, you might reasonably guess correctly is ‘Marvel: Avengers Assemble’ (long UK release name henceforth referred to as Avengers). I grew up with animated series like X-Men, as well as the Marvel Action Hour in the early-mid 1990s and although X-Men has not been as impressive in its film incarnations, I have always been drawn to characters like Iron Man and Captain America. I think Marvel Studios and the Marvel Empire at large recognise that a good amount of money can be made from fanboys.

I feel a certain amount of indifference toward the rest of the world now that I feel this way. I can't be bothered how the rest of mankind reacts to me. I don't care about that. I'll very selfishly be depressed and only care about my own comfort while I am. I can't worry about how other people feel about that. It's not up to me to be concerned about it.
Sweet friends of ours from our child birthing classes just had twin boys!!! Oh, and their daughter is only a few weeks older than Tucker!!! I can't even believe it!!! They were so sweet to ask me to create custom canvases for over the boy's cribs, and I was thrilled to oblige, especially since this meant that I got to know the names before everyone else!

But then that's what plastic lens and toy camera shooting is all about, isn't it? You have to have a decent subject, and choose good angles and lighting.

Since each one is so unpredictable, that's what makes it special.

In 1983 Compaq released its first product which is also quite successful, the Compaq Portable.

I have to say though, I didn't love the movie as much as I liked the book. It definitely wasn't as cheesy as Twilight (thank god!) but the book was much better. I thought the scene in the cave would have been a little more dramatic - he was so sick in the book! And they dragged out all the stuff up to the games wayyyyy too long. But I mean I guess they had to, right? To set up the characters and everything? I thought the casting was pretty good though; the only person I didn't love was Cato. I really thought he should have been bigger, but seeing as how he has a relatively small part in the story it doesn't really matter.

Trouble is, what do I do with this blog? I can't keep calling it Hackney Hackette. It's annoying as I got listed on a lot of other sites but to be fair, I assume they want to read about Hackney which is going to be unlikely. Do I continue here but change the name (can you even do that), or start another blog and link it to this one? And what can I call it? Colchester something? The Voyage Home? Something to do with Romans and castles, Twinkle Little Star or Old King Cole? I'm sure you can't stand the suspense. And what are you still doing here anyway? Wasn't it a bit dark and lonely all that time?

Finally, as the end of my 121 approached this morning, I told Mr Therapist that my friends had been encouraging me to write him a letter over the past few days, but how I was rather proud of myself for actually talking about the issues 1-on-1 rather than hiding behind the contents of a letter. It made him smile and he commented it was good progress. As I was leaving, I said he needed to bring in some books for the bookcase, and I could happily lend him a few if he wanted! Perhaps I will buy him a pot plant…

I decided that if He wanted me there, He would make it happen. So Saturday, I posted my note on Facebook again and let Him do the rest. Yesterday marked my 5 month anniversary since I lost my life and found my soul. I shared my story again and this time, God showed up and showed out! Do you hear me? Yesterday was a good day!! Last night I was talking to my friend Tymm, who along with his awesome wife Laura, started Brighton Their World in honor of their son, Brighton Asher, who passed away at his orphanage in Ethiopia before they could get there to bring him home. He is now resting peacefully in our Father's arms. I was telling him about how I wanted to do some sort of drive to collect formula to take with me wherever He sends me. God spoke right to me through Tymm. It's true. Tymm told me that they would be THRILLED to send formula with me!! After all, that's what they do! I honestly about fell out of my chair! On a daily basis, I am in awe of who God puts in my path to help me. But He didn't stop there. While I was chatting with Tymm, another friend-that-I've-never-met popped up on chat and said she really wanted to talk with me about Uganda. Turns out she had been praying about giving me a donation and cheerfully said she would send me the $700 needed to bridge the gap between what I had in savings and what I needed to make the first down payment for the trip (the $2250 plane ticket). The only problem was that I wasn't sure when Sheryl would buy the tickets. I contacted her last night and they bought the tickets yesterday. She took a team to Guatemala earlier this week (read more about their trip on their blog) and will check to see if they can get me a ticket when she gets back on Mon or Tue. Sounds like everything is falling into place . . . or am I just getting my hopes up to be let down again?

When we are at zero, we have to start somewhere, and perhaps the sanest, best, and surest place to start is with the eye of the beholder. We are in a certain place at a certain time and we feel a certain way about it. Let’s start here. That means put the pen to the page and write about the exact moment and place where you find yourself. Take an inventory of what surrounds you and what you feel about that. This is a starting-off place.

According to an Aboriginal friend in the Northern Territory, the situation in her community has just got worse and many of their own initiatives and efforts of self determination have been shelved. Consequently I attended the showing of a film “Living the Intervention” followed by a panel discussion with Aboriginal community representatives and John Pilger among others. The Intervention was imposed without ANY consultation with the communities at all. This immediately alienated many of them, and of course they had no opportunity to express what needs and assistance they knew their communities urgently required – from a police presence, to adequate housing, education etc.

So while I don’t normally push my work so much, I strongly recommend everyone read the article, as there are some astonishing facts found in it. I, for one, was not aware of the extent of child labour in our times. Did you know that there are an estimated 218 million children currently affected by child labour? That’s 14% of all children around the world!

Most adults today with a history of meltdowns are able to exercise at least a degree of contol over their triggers. We often know when someone is "pushing our buttons" and can switch topics or leave the room.

We're at least that much better off than our children.

A lot of these questions will never be answered (or at least, not in writing. Or out loud). But one think I did want to answer was the last question. My childhood was filled with English books, thanks to a half-english mother and a desperate need to devour everything that looked like a sentence. Growing up in Norway I did of course read Norwegian books as well, but less and less as I grew older. And so, after my last, Ibsen-filled Norwegian class I turned my back on Norwegian literature, and focused my attentions unbrokenly on the vast English canon. To me, Norwegian books had a whiff of the spartan, of the frugal, of the depressive. Even the funny ones were funny in a full-stop, don’t-talk-to-much-or-your-tongue-will-freeze, one-sentence-for-every-shot-of-vodka kind of funny.

Maybe you have noticed that I haven't been posting as often as I used to around here. Maybe you haven't noticed! My life has changed over the past 4 1/2 months. My younger brother got engaged and I decided that it was time to get serious about getting healthy because I wanted to feel great at his wedding and enjoy having my picture taken. I joined Wow! Boot Camp, which is an awesome workout that combines cardio, strength training, intervals, etc. and starting training for a half marathon with other Boot Campers. I became a part of a great support system. I also got serious about my nutrition. I started keeping a food diary and writing down every single thing that I ate. Every little bite. Now I use Lose It! as a way to track my calories and exercise.

I was very pleased to read of the success HDC was having in collecting the serious rent arrears owed by its tenants, reportedly in excess of $240M. Of course this is not the first time there has been an effort to rectify this situation, so hopefully this will be a sustained program as it is vital that housing be treated with proper responsibility. That responsibility would extend from the quality of the designs and construction, the treatment of contractors and suppliers all the way to housing policies which respond to the needs of the needy.
I guess that means that the people who go home, those who decide they can’t make it all four months, are pretty damn weak. It’s only logical, right?

Then, everyone who is taking part in the Secret Recipe Club posts their new recipe on the same day at the same time.

They were working on their window display to celebrate Earth Day this week-end, and it was looking very exciting. I'm planning on going back on Saturday as I will be downtown for other Earth Day festivities.

I give thanks to the wonderful interviews with Margaret Throsby in the mornings and thankfully are online. With spoon in hand and Pixie in the highchair I am enthralled by the stories. Tom Kennelly most recently sparkled in my ears with his wit and canny knack for hearing wonderfully true stories that are begging to be made into fiction.
Different opinions do not have to equal war. I am confident enough to let you have your opinion. Make your opinion clear but do it polite. Your attitude might actually push people away and you could end up alone one day if you don’t learn to be polite, no one likes rudeness.
It wouldn’t surprise me to see Fiesta move in at the former Albertson’s by my current house at Ohlen and Research. Someone mentioned the possibility of a “Hispanic grocery store” moving in there at one of my neighborhood association meetings a few months back.

2) He's kind of cute - and if you know me, you know that cute guys don't generally congregate around me . Unless they're sophmores or younger...just my lot in life I guess. :) He's not drop-dead gorgeous but I wouldn't want to hang out w/ someone like that because then all the girls would be hitting on him.

The sharks are lurking. Why? Because that’s where they live and hunt. Not so much lurking as hanging out waiting for lunch and pulling off a few aerial acrobatics to impress the vixenish shark harlots. Sharklots? Shar-lots?

My husband had scheduled a two week vacation for July at the start of his new job and I have been soaking up every moment and pretending this is what my life is really like.
He used the bell as a way to rebuild them physcologically, switiching from the abusive monster to the kind caregiver he instructed them to ring the bell when they needed to releave themselves. After being forced to lie in thier own excrement for days on end they were elated to be let out. During these bathroom breaks he doled out little rewards like letting them walk around a bit longer, or letting them wash up, so that over time they became gratiful, even happy to see him. Eventually they were so reliant on him for thier needs they couldn’t imagine leaving.

Joe was first diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy when he was taken to hospital looking grey at just three weeks old. An X-ray showed his heart was severely enlarged. He was later diagnosed with a genetic disorder – Barth syndrome, which leads to muscle weakness, short stature and feeding problems.
The socio-economic conditions of the land that gave them birth were high on the agenda both formally and informally. The GT folks were loud and forceful in declaring the way they felt about how the country was going. No communiqué was issued at day-clean but the mere mutterings and utterings would force any onlooker to gargle. Boat gone a falls; he cant turn back now.

He takes photos. That’s it. They’re not prepped; there is no studio, no set up. Candid. People on the street in New York, in Paris, just wandering around. He sees something, he takes a picture. And that is all he does. He barely eats. I’m not even sure he sleeps. He simply takes photos of anything he likes. No less. No more. He doesn’t give a shit about celebrity or fame or manners or whatever. If it’s ‘boring’, you’re out of the club, bucko. Good luck next year when you’re not such a bland, cookie-cutter douchebag, crowding the streets of our cities, spreading cultural excrement in a way to build your own insatiable self-esteem…

In February of 2006, I started this blog. I named it "Adventures in the 100 Acre Wood" and that is exactly what we've had in the last five years. Later, when Dad needed a legal name for the farm, he called it Mil-Ton Farms. Mil for Miller and Ton for Appleton. There is also a town near us called Milton.
Keeping up with music trends isn’t always pleasant business. Sometimes all you hear is garbage, every once in a while something truly great comes along. But mostly you may hear a glimpse of something great, however it’s masked, drowned and buried in excessive and purposeful repetition, over-use of bass or a certain, specific sound. Yes, I’m talking to you Dubstep. So why bother you may ask?
Holy shit.
As this process continues, you will all become living examples for others to emulate and follow. It will become obvious that you know of what you speak, for the evidence will shine before them.

Did you know that planes don’t have a reverse? I didn’t either, until today. Let me back up. A few days ago, when we were heading to our vacay destination, I was sitting in the airport with the babes. We happened to be sitting near a window where we could see lots of planes getting ready to taxi down to the runway. My oldest noticed that when the planes backed up, there were these little golf-cart looking things hooked up to the front. He kept asking why they were there. Of course, I had no idea.

‘We used to,’ Petro said, ‘back at the start. Now we’ve got self-winding technology,’ he pulled himself up onto the rope and grabbed onto an ideally placed knot, leaving space for Felicity to do the same underneath him, ‘which pulls us up.’ Felicity’s heart was pounding but, reminding herself how far she had already come, she grabbed onto the lower knot and lost contact with the tree; and with that, the last remnant of terra firma. ‘Hold on tight,’ Petro said, ‘but this time think solid thoughts: both you and the rope are insubstantiated!’

In large amounts, niacin commonly causes flushing and headache, although this can be avoided by taking it in the form of inositol hexaniacinate. Large doses of riboflavin result in very bright yellow urine.
With the EVO 4G it was obvious early on the many “underground” developers and third party manufacturers were fully embracing this device. With any device that is the first of its kind comes many complaints for a variety of reasons. Hands down the largest complaint on this device was battery life. This opened up a huge market for third party manufacturers of batteries. I myself purchased two Anker brand batteries with a wall charger that allows me to charge the device and a spare battery at the same time. Now I use these batteries for my normal every day usage with no worries of the battery lasting me a full day without charge. I also purchased an extended high capacity battery for when I am going to really be hammering on the device and will not be near a power source to charge my device.

His company, Hawkes Ocean Technologies, is one of a number of businesses that specialize in taking the superrich diving. Hawkes’ asking price for the Deepflight Super Falcon, for example, is $1.7 million (€1.3 million). American manufacturer SEAmagine’s Ocean Pearl costs even more, at $2.5 million, but has the benefit of being able to dive to depths of around 900 meters (3,000 feet).
All that to say, this is probably why Jonah and I make a good team. I can help him with his anxieties during surgery and he can help me with my anxieties over recovery. Not that it makes any of it that much easier.
My mother passed away 23 years ago today. I was 16, and it was horrible for a long time, but it's OK now. Really it is. I will always miss her terribly, but I'm good. Even after something really awful happens, things work out and the universe has a way of righting itself. Trust me on this one.

At the end of the protest when one person got up to say entry to the council chambers was by ticket only and everyone else should go home, a group of students got up and announced their intent to march on the banks, who they described as the “real cause behind the cuts”. Around 25 then march along the road for a short protest outside Halifax bank headquarters with lively chanting.
In his article, Muravchik describes how Soros has admitted to having carried some rather “potent messianic fantasies with me from childhood, which I felt I had to control, otherwise they might get me in trouble.” Be that as it may. After WWII, Soros attended the London School of Economics, where he fell under the thrall of fellow atheist and Hungarian, Karl Popper, one of his professors. Popper was a mentor to Soros until Popper’s death in 1994. Two of Popper’s most influential teachings concerned “the open society,” and Fallibilism.

I am fortunate that my parents never took all of this too seriously. I remember my dad making a flip comment under his breath as I was "presented," and my mother said that if nothing else it would make a good story someday. In her drinking days, she was known to squeeze into some of her old party frocks and go to parties dressed as an aging debutante.

The early stages of mobility in the workplace were fairly simple: A couple top executives had private cellphones with numbers that only the most important people could reach. The wall between the C-suite and the rest of enterprises began to erode with the rise of the BlackBerry, as mobile email became pervasive through the entire corporate structure. But we’re still waiting for the next step.

Natasha Romanoff: Doctor, we need you to come in.
Watney's used to be a brewery with a respectable pedigree dating back to the early 19th century. Regrettably, it became a pioneer in the keg revolution that produced awful beers which were regularly advertised in the most expensive slots on television, and which very nearly destroyed real ale. Their most famous, or perhaps notorious, product was Watney's Red Barrel. Advertised using the old music hall song, Roll Out The Barrel, adapted as Roll Out Red Barrel (which you can see here, if you want to see how the 1960s weren't always wonderful), the beer became incredibly popular. "Incredibly" to us, I suppose, but this was an era when real ale was really hit and miss, and returning drinks could result in summary ejection from the pub (many licensees took complaints about the beer as a personal insult), so many drinkers tended to welcome the consistency of keg.
In my prime, I occupied every corner of a number of romantic triangles. Perhaps I learned from these experiences, perhaps not. What I remember about them is that they are very challenging but very compelling, too. I don't think back happily on these experiences when I look at them whole, but I treasure bits and pieces, blissful moments spent with the person I wasn't supposed to be with, or the way in which the affairs I engaged in helped me appreciate my primary relationships. It worked that way sometimes, it really did.
Republicans are hoping to reduce the effects of two current bans that limit people’s freedom of choice in Michigan, the ban on smoking in public places and the ban on deliberately farting in people’s faces while simultaneously sticking them with a needle containing a slow-acting poison.

I am not happy about the emotional toll this takes on a mother struggling with a life and death decision. But that is precisely the issue at hand - life and death. The problem with seeing the baby and hearing the heartbeat is that is irrefutable evidence of the life that already exists within the mother. Whatever reasons a person may have for wanting to imagine the audience in their underwear or to ignore the danger of a slip high in the air, it pales in comparison to ending the life of the most innocent of people.
In addition, gallery stroll has officially changed names to “Art Chase,” and is part of a group of activities collectively being called “Downtown Provo First Friday Events.” And unlike previous months, there is actually information available online.
And yet, despite having felt fairly screwed up by my own parents, I went on to have two kids of my own. I never expected to. I really thought I wouldn't but I did. And I certainly made a pretty poor job of it and behaved quite irresponsibly. And yet they have both made it to adulthood and daughter #1 (above) now has two children of her own. To see her mother her children is an absolute delight. Astonishingly, given that I wasn't a great mother so I don't think she had a good role model, she is amazing! This proves that a mother's influence isn't necessarily as central as we might think.
Music is intricately woven into the fabric of our lives. The sound of a particular song can take us back to a time and place long gone. It can evoke feelings of happiness, sadness and nostalgia. Musical instruments have long allowed us to express emotions without the spoken word. Viva la music!
Furthermore, as reported in TruckingInfo.com, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., introduced legislation to address the detention time, HR 756 that would limit the number of hours a driver can be detained and the FMCSA was looking at doing the same.
What do you think? Do you feel yourself losing focus when on the Internet?
It's all contextual. Who you are, or rather the relevant parts of who you are, depends on the situation, doesn't it? For example, when I wrote the bio requested of me for the staff newsletter, I kept it simple. A few words about my past job in a psychiatric hospital, a passing nod to my education (which turned out to be quite relevant because one of the people making the decision to hire me is also an I.U. grad), and a quick mention of the awards I've won in the International Administrative Assistants Olympics. (Silver medal in sorting out Fed-Ex Fuck-ups; Gold in Excel Spreadsheet Obstacle Courses, and an all expenses paid weekend at the Sybaris and a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon for coming in fifth place in the Chicagoland Office Chair Demolition Derby 1994.)

The Flat Classroom Conference was so amazing, I kept saying, "I wish I could bottle this feeling and bring it back with me." We all know that feelings can't fit inside of bottles, but the good news is that thanks to the flattening of the obstacles separating our classrooms, we can recreate that feeling right in our own schools.

This was definitely invented by somebody who had no children and who lived in a soundproof room. Seriously one of the dumbest inventions of all time. It is in my top three.
Wednesday the 21st till Saturday the 31st – Jonathon Dove’s “Life Is A Dream” (Birmingham Opera Company) @ The Argyle Works, Bordesley Green (or is this still Digbeth?), Birmingham – Right, seriously now: even though there’s Flatpack and Crufts and everything else this month, this is the big one for March (and quite possibly all of 2012). And that’s no insult to any of the other lovely things going on. This is a new opera based in Calderon that has been specifically written (by Jonathon Dove, libretto by Alasdair Middleton) for the Birmingham Opera Company, whose performances place you in the midst of an immersive world rather than have you sit there looking at a stage. Go go go go go to this, you will not regret it.

At the start of the season (you can only visit outside the monsoon), it was still pretty busy and we were lucky to get a bed. Our room was cheap by Malaysian standards at 35RM (7 pounds) but next to a generator and also a family of giant monitor lizards…. bloody huge they were! But once we put some fairy lights up it was transformed into our little home for 5 days.

For the last 100 years, and in America, at least, quilting has had a much more open history of sharing, teaching, and community service. A group of women often formed quilting bees to collectively quilt quilts for each others families. They didn't mind quilting Sue's daughter's quilt because they knew one day Sue, and maybe even her daughter would help quilt one of their quilts too.

This has always reflected my knowing that when you meet "the one" you recognise them. There is no mistaking it. That it is just there, not someone new but someone who has been with us always. There are many kinds of love, most of us will love many people in different ways, but one will stand out as connected in someway to us on a different level. There is no explanation, no reason, so logic, it just is as it is.
This is the best first week I can remember on this show. Everyone did well enough and no one was annoying. Hope it stays that way. Some seasons have been unbearable because of it. No gimmicky "stars" or wannabees or weirdos. I'm looking forward to the rest of this season. At this point I can't predict who might win or go home. We can tell more when they do different dances. No one sucked. Some were definitely better than others, so we'll see.
It is ok if you have to be active during the session. Many people have to work or take care of their families during this time. It can still be very beneficial if you aren't able to be quiet. It reduces the effects some but a lot of energy can still get in. You can also sleep during the session. This is good way to receive the energy because you will be relaxed.
NIU has offered American Sign Language since the 1970s as part of its rehabilitation counseling program, mainly for students in that program. But lately more students from other disciplines have asked to enroll because the skill is marketable in fields like teaching and health care.
The current attempt to stuff the square peg of Greece's character and culture into the round hole of Germany's is simply not going to work. The EU's pig-headed decision to prolong the Greeks' agony rather than push for their quick (and inevitable) default and exit from the Eurozone is simply unconscionable.
I had a lot of photos to work into this two page spread so I scanned through my ScrapGirls collections and found several sets that worked well together. This is one of the great things about purchasing digital collections thought sites like ScrapGirls. The items in the collections are made to work together so you are not pulling your hair out finding things that "play nice" with other elements on your page. Then again you can alter colors, shapes and sizes as needed and you don't run out of anything since you can use the products over and over again. All for one small investment. I call that a Win- Win!
Not that I had any such ambitions at that time. In those days, my creative impulse was channelled not into writing, but drawing. (I have always written, but back then, the words were a mere adjunct to the pictures). Everything I produced was pronounced a marvel by my mum – and therefore, as far as I was concerned, utter rubbish.

Suddenly, at the end of the back up, my laptop tells me that there was some sort of error, do I want to retry? Apprehensively, I say yes, and all seems fine. I then WIPE my old phone, as my hubby wants to use it, and copy his information onto my old phone. Switch it on, and hey presto! – all is well. I then turn on my new phone and…

Conclusion, i am proud to be a Malaysian. My Japanese Professor once asking me if i ever given another chance to reborn, what nationality would i choose. Frankly, without pausing a second, i answered Malaysia! I am glad that i was growing up in Malaysia. With the unique diversity of people, as you can see how many languages and dialects i speak, there's no second doubt for me not to choose Malaysia as the place i wanna settle down and raise up my kids (if God allows) in the future. Malaysia Truly Asia, the only perfect place that we can produce multi-lingual people. What are you pondering now? Go back to Malaysia and raise up your kids there!
Oddly enough, trying to get a posse to go to this gig is proving difficult, despite people saying they'd love to go. Family commitments make it tough for many, after all, it's not usual to take a 2 hour train ride at 10am on a Saturday just to get in 8 hours of drinking before turning back, or at least not for them. My wife has encouraged me to go all Saturday. She must be up to something... Anyway, if you're in the area, let me know :)

Suddenly at 11am, I had dozed off and was awoken by a gurgle and wheezing sound. Next to me, Zelda was jerking her hands and had started seizing. I called (in this order): Evan, Jason (our EMS commander BFF), and 911. While I was making the calls, I ran to the fridge, took out her Diastat and gave her a suppository of medicine (sorry if that's TMI)...and it worked! She immediately calmed down.

A couple years ago, an anthropologist in Mexico City contacted me. She had heard rumblings about this potential cataclysm and wanted to determine if any scientific basis to support the claims. I felt that some of the following questions need to be addressed. Did the ancient Mayans possess the technology to accurately predict this cataclysm with great precision? Is it even possible for the proposed threat to cause a global cataclysm? Where are the physical signs that the cataclysm is about to occur? At the time, the focus of the cataclysmic threat was from a
I have never seen a leopard in person. But I have been told they exist by people who have seen them, therefore I believe it. But if someone says they experienced a miracle, most will assume that person is crazy. In fact, some people who experience God will never tell their story in fear of being criticized, because apparently people who believe in God are somehow lacking in intelligence. Yet I say science is the one who is lacking.

Almost all of this is just patterned paper that I fussy cut a design out of.
For me, cooking awesome meals used to be fun. This was somewhere during, oh… maybe the first six months of my marriage? I was determined to be the good little wife that tried new recipes almost every night of the week, and I beamed when my husband loved them and pouted when a meal didn’t turn out as great as I’d hoped. But somewhere along the way, I burned out on all the cooking (as I often do with… everything), and I never really got back into it. Now I stick to tried and true recipes (especially ones that are extremely easy), and I grumble to myself all throughout the process of preparing a meal. When I’m not begging to go out somewhere to eat, that is. Terrible, I know.
Heat the cream in a heavy saucepan gently. You want to scald it, which means that it is just starting to steam but doesn't actually boil. Boiling cream is bad; trust me on that one. Place the chocolate, orange zest, and Grand Marnier in a separate bowl. Once the cream is gently steaming, pour it over the chocolate and stir until the chocolate is fully melted.

My oldest daughter, now a senior, is unable to balance a check book or address an envelope on her own. I know she could figure it out...she is an extremely bright girl! But she is graduating not knowing these real life skills!!! My mom had been helping her one on one to get through her last class (government) and she told me that she had never learned so much in her life! That's when the light bulb really went on in my mind and I could feel God's encouragement to consider this "home school thing" for my two youngest.
We know change is never easy, especially when it’s something you’ve spent lots of time and effort on. Even more, there are human beings at YouTube who look at every piece of feedback, bucket them into categories, and work with product teams to address them each week. So whenever you see a blue "Send Feedback" link, know that that's not some decorative ornament. It's for real. So give your feedback because we (humans) need it to keep creating ways for YouTube to showcase your channels.
In 3 months time, I wrote a book. I joined a website, Writersbeat.com, where I met my internet bestie/crit partner, whom you all know as Ruth Lauren Steven. After an initial major bitch moment from me (which we shall not discuss!), Ruth and I began exchanging critiques and became fast friends. We moved on to another website, Scribophile.com, where I met a ton of amazing friends who were, in addition to Ruth, completely invaluable in honing my writing. This book needed the rest of the year to edit, as it was sucky. Boring and sucky and will never see the light of day. But I learned a lot.
I'll also be happy to share with you stories about parking, shopping and dining at the Disneyland Resort.

AND THIS IS HOW IT WORKS IN REAL LIFE, PEOPLE. Everyone thinks they have the right to shoot anyone who "advances" on them, or just squats in a house. We have regressed to the Wild West, where everyone can pull their glossy six-shooters on everyone else, while simultaneously claiming to be the wronged party.
I bet many people don't notice the odd spelling of the beer, or forget it once they take their first sip. It's a strange beer. First of all, it's rather thick in a way most commercial beers aren't. It is sweetish and estery, and again, I picked up a plum note. I suspected--and later confirmed--that sugar was employed, for it had that characteristic estery quality that seems to come mainly from fermented sugar. However, here again the main identifying quality about Old Peculier is a bit of funkiness. It's not like the funkiness you'd find in a Belgian or even an Irish stout, and it took me a long time before I could figure out how to describe it.
The moon is in cancer. The sun eclipses all.
“Perhaps the most damning assessments of the Department’s handling of the fallout from Operation Fast and Furious have come from two Justice Department officials. Kenneth Melson, the former Acting AFT Director during the pendency of Fast and Furious, told Congress that, “it appears thoroughly to us that the department is really trying to figure out a way to push the information away from their political appointees at the department.” Patrick Cunningham, who had been tasked by the Justice Department with investigating ATF whistleblower allegations of gunwalking, would later invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions about his work.”

As a gymnast you can practice a specific routine for months and months. Even if you’ve perfected it in practice what counts is the meet. Sometimes you are going to fall off the horse (in this case the pommel.) It’s not the end of the world or your career, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad gymnast. It simply means that you need to keep your ego in check, learn from the experience, and try again.

We just really have good people in our lives. Over the past few weeks, we've watched as our grant grows, day by day, dollar by dollar. $10 here, $20 there, more frequently than it ever grew during a giveaway or fundraiser. God is FAITHFUL. His people are FAITHFUL. I have no idea how to respond anymore to the overwhelming support that you all continue to show our family. It is the most humbling and remarkable thing I have ever been a part of.
So I spoke with Ken and we decided to not allow any shows or movies that have any form of violence. It was hard to list them all and take them off the list because we hadn't realized just how much violence was present, and often very subtle violence. Once we did, we spoke to Maddie about it and asked her to please support this by not asking to see any show or movie on the "banned" list. She agreed.

Any claim to the superiority of faith over evidence and reason can’t be disproven by evidence and reason. This is why—in the short term anyway—atheists can only reach believers who are susceptible to rational argument. True believers literally don’t care about evidence and reason (although they might use it in an attempt to persuade the ignorant). For example, if it were possible to prove conclusively that the entire Bible was written by some prankster, it wouldn’t matter in the least to them. They would just say, “That was how God chose to bring us his word,” or, “God allowed Satan to create false evidence in order to test the faithful.” Afterwards, they would believe even more strongly than before. Faith isn’t just belief in the absence of evidence; faith is belief despite the evidence.

Islamic architecture has always been a great source of inspiration for me, but it has always been difficult for me to truly capture the essence of these magnificently hypnotic architectural marvels. A cornerstone of this architecture is the Girih (Persian for ‘knots’), which are essentially tiling patterns prominently displayed on the walls, pillars, as well as on the convex of the domes. These mesmerizing tessellations are formed with a few basic tile patterns repeated over and over again. You can find examples of these all across the globe including the Middle East, India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Spain and Turkey.

It took us all afternoon. We didn't finish up until almost 5 pm! We came inside, and grabbed my basket, and headed out to the bark park. When we got there, we saw lots of pups! Rocky was there. Benry was there. Cheyenne, Stuie and Gizzy were there! Oh, and their huBro was there with his dog too! I played with my ball for a while, and Ben kind of played with me. Every one else left, and it was just Ben and I so we ran around chasing each other, and chasing my ball. His Mom said she may try to bring him to the lake and see if he will swim with me on Sunday! I hope he gets to come play! I know he will love swimming!

The kids are loving our semester. Our ancient history co-op is going great, we are learning so much & having so much fun with our friends. The art class we found at the end of the summer is teaching all of us something each week, & it has renewed the kids' interest in drawing & writing. Michael has picked up where he left off on his novel, & I'm so proud of the progress he has made! He is also doing wonderful with his guitar lessons - something he has wanted to do for years. Emily & I are thoroughly enjoying our knit/crochet class, which we take at the same time Michael has his guitar class. Emily has gotten frustrated with her little projects, but turned her focus instead to handsewing a doll (without a pattern!) & crosstitching a ladybug using a kit I passed on to her. I love learning alongside my kids!
notes: first time doing bench press since my shoulder got hurt, I am happy with it as a start. For the pushups I realized I was doing less than I should be for the pushup challenge, so I stacked more towards the end to compensate for total numbers. Week 5 Day 1 Level 1 complete. My left shoulder was aching during the pec deck, so I cut it short. I am happy the twisting curls went better than they did last week! Biceps had a decent pump going after the last set, so I made sure to take a drink from the water bottle when the ladies walked by, so I could flex the biceps, HAHA.

The rooms aren't scary, exactly, but they are very - um, unsettling. It's not like there's a murderer or a dead body in them...it's more like I get this sinking feeling when I open the door, like, "Oh, crap, that room needs a LOT of cleaning up." I always kind of start to pick up a few things, and then it's just too much for me, and I leave the room. And that's about it.

Using an 8×10 view camera, I am photographing the ruins of a once monumental military-industrial complex as it tangles with the surrounding landscape of forest, fields and swamp. While certain structures offer a glimpse of what has transpired on this site, many of my photographs refer to contamination or violence through metaphor. TNT storage igloos are depicted in a serial typology to convey the massive scale of military weapons production, while the emptiness of the landscape, photographed with a muted palette and diffused light, is meant to evoke a kind of post-apocalyptic environment – one that is at times bleak and somber, yet also strangely resilient and beautiful.”
Team Guy and Team Kakashi know that there is a protective barrier of the Akatsuki hideout, being generated by 5 forbidden tags in the area.

So, I sadly dropped the Body Business membership in favor of this new gym, which I will hereafter refer to as "24-Year-Old Fitness." I know what I need to do, and will just get in there and do it without too much fuss, but I think I already hate this place. It's totally crowded and loud, and, as perhaps alluded to in my snarky nickname, it's just so...young. Like, UT student young. (Honestly, why do they go there? They HAVE a nice gym. They should just keep their taut little bodies away from the real people, you know?)

New content arrives. Valor points now give gear commensurate with the new raid content. The player has a steady income of this new gear from clearing 5-mans and/or older content (now nerfed with extreme prejudice). He jumps into the new content, regardless of where he was in the prior content, what gear he has, or how good he is. He gets new gear steadily, regardless of his ability to master any part of the new content, and certainly without having to master anything more difficult than what he’s done before. In initial 4.3 Valor Point announcements, Blizzard stated that Tier 13 set items would not be obtainable from Valor Points, a hint of a welcome reversal that proved to be a red herring: later announcements clarified that VP can now buy T13-equivalent gear in nearly every slot. Yin and yang have unraveled at both ends—progression and reward neither feed each other nor even pay attention to each other. The player plods along getting gear and seeing content, both at a predetermined rate. And the saddest part of all is what’s not in this picture: nowhere is it the slightest bit relevant whether, from one tier to the next, he improved at the game.

One topic that seems to constantly come up in conversation at the moment is the price of a pint (or a half, or two thirds, or whatever you’re drinking) and the general consensus seems to be that craft beer is too expensive to which I disagree. I work in the musical instrument industry, an industry that works from painfully low margins and one that sees shop closures on an almost weekly basis (sound familiar?) When I decide to put my prices up it’s because my suppliers have put their prices up and because of the rapidly increasing cost of shipping, manufacture and raw materials. If you want a hand crafted, heritage laden Gibson Les Paul then you pay a premium but you can buy a pretty reasonable made in China Epiphone copy for about a fifth of the price.

After lunch, we headed across to the second island where Nanny and Grampy took to the shallow water which for the most part was at the temperature of a warm bath! We snorkelled a bit more, but there was not much to see except a crab or two and some fish that live in holes in the sandy bottom.
Secondly, if you use the last of the toilet paper on the roll, could you, please, change the roll? Again, new rolls are kept right on top of the toilet tank, all you have to do is unwrap it and put it back in the dispenser. I assure you, it's really not that difficult of a task.
An important note: One of the reasons Democrats, leftists and avowed Marxists so easily steal away our rights in this country is because “we the people” have grown largely ignorant of the rights that are ours to begin with: and many of those who know our rights only know them abstractly. For example, many citizens know that we have religious freedom yet aren’t familiar with the way the First Amendment is worded. So they don’t understand that the amendment doesn’t just recognize our God-given right to religious freedom, but actually bars the government from interfering in our religious exercises. (In other words, when the First Amendment says “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” it ties the hands of government, not the hands of the people. Yet in our ignorance we’ve allowed these things to be reversed.)

I used to love a good cuppa cappuccino when we were in India. The Coffee Day ones were so amazing, I could easily have 2 to 3 at one go. But here, its not the same. Its way too milky for my liking. So whenever I head to a Starbucks or Costa, I end up ordering an Americano and then add a wee bit of milk. I prefer super strong, super sweet coffee's and I must add that the coffee maker/ cafetiere ones come no where near our South Indian filter coffee. But we are now so used to having it, or rather we are so used to the convenience of just pouring it out of a pot that we have forgotten how yummy it really is. Ro has made it a point to grind his own coffee and use it, which is fine when you take it black. But with milk, it all just goes for a toss.

McCormack’s understanding of Barth accounts for the objections that Van Til and subsequent evangelicals propounded regarding Barth’s account of scripture. McCormack answers Van Til’s allegation that Barth “espouses a subjectivism in which human faith is the condition of the Bible’s becoming the word of God.” While not resolving all tensions for evangelicals that are committed to a classical account of metaphysics and the historical Anglo-American account of Enlightenment epistemology, it creates space for dialogue between evangelicals that have divided over Barth’s proposals.
As you can see, I keep some very random things in there. My beloved Rookie All Stars, some smaller sets (some of which are even finished) that may or may not find a binder, and my Mike Piazza game used cards...yes, I have a boatload of them. No, I am not looking to get rid of any them. Yet.
Anger? I do not understand it. I am glad it is beyond my comprehension, because it means that someone is so deeply entrenched in their sins, that they have chosen evil so many times that they have grown to love it. I cannot say they are happy in their ways; that is contrary to eternal truth. But they are addicted to the satisfaction of it, the thrill, the adrenaline rush perhaps. They choose to remain lost and rebellious.

If you need to also strain honey from that beeswax, melt the filtered beeswax once again and then pour it into another bowl you never want to use for food again and let it cool. The wax will settle and harden on top and the honey will rest on the bottom. You can just pull the wax off the top and go on with the recipe. Then you can use some of the honey, too, and OH isn't that just handy.

Other things I remember about my mom were her frequent headaches, a very messy house, her perfectionism (which I believe hindered her housekeeping), her nervousness over finances (there was always a struggle to make ends meet), and her sadness.

The weekend I was home for Grandma’s funeral, I was supposed to be in Chicago for Nourished (a food blogger conference) and the Gluten-free & Allergy-free Expo. I wanted desperately to go and see my blogger friends again and finally meet some others in person, yet every time I prayed about going, I kept getting a “no” feeling. When Auntie Ai called me with the news, it was clear to me why. I was supposed to go home instead of Chicago. I was supposed to spend an enormous amount of time with my family. I was supposed to remember that I have more grandmothers still living.

With a fresh spin on high school comedy, albeit not revolutionary on the genre, it does add something new to films that have had permanently near obvious stereotypes written in them for years. Full of laughs and a fairly decent plot line to move things on along, 21 Jump Street is a well needed reawakening for the industry that plays on what has stayed the same for three decades or so.
There are a lot of games out there for the Xbox Live Arcade, open since the Christmas month of 2004. Through its eight years of existence, some really good and bad XBLA titles have come to be. Some good examples include the ‘Splosion Man duo, Limbo, and Super Meat Boy. Some bad examples include Zombie Wranglers, Tour de France 2009, and Blazing Birds. And another bad example might include the recently released title Warp, the second “XBLA House Party” released for the XBLA, PS3, and PC. In this game, you control an inhuman character named Zero, who seemingly looks like he was a rejected de Blob sidekick. Zero is taken to a military-grade facility, where he fades in and out of consciousness and at one point awakens to find that he is being operated on, having a disc-shaped object extracted from him. Soon after, through telepathic procedures, a fellow alien contacts our hero, saying that it can sense other aliens in the facility and planning the duo’s great escape. Zero then proceeds to fulfill his title as a facility escapee under your control, helping any aliens on the way, but not before reabsorbing that disc. It may seem kinda cute, but this game fulfills its M-rated properties: Warp seems like the perfect name for this game, not only manifesting our hero’s eponymous attack (where he warps through walls and even through people & objects), but also of the game’s oddly balanced warp between violence and cuteness.

The Confederation of Cinque Ports (pronounced "sink" ports (not as the French cinq) is an historic series of coastal towns in Kent and Sussex. These are Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Originally formed for military and trade purposes by Henry III and later Edward I the charter provided safe harbour, a quota of ships and men to sail them. In return for their support the ports were granted common rights and privileges, with freedom from taxes and custom duties and the right to hold judicial courts. The name originates from Norman French, meaning "five ports".
Employees in more than 250 stores were specially trained to crack more than 300 wheels at one time. A representative from the Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese Consortium was in attendance in Toronto at the Loblaws at Maple Leaf Gardens store as the stores attempted the historic endeavour which CheeseLover.ca witnessed at the Pickering store—mainly because we love the smell and taste of freshly cracked DOP Parm.

And I corrected them but they didn’t hear me. “You looked really skinny.”
While we were hanging out at the bubble tea joint, I started fantasizing about where to go for my first moto trip. I didn't want it to be too mountainous because I'm still terrified of unexpected things on curves. My BF made a good point...think of your trip as part of your training. That made me realize that if I was going to wait until I was 100% comfortable and confident in my riding skills, I'd be waiting forever. There will always be something I want to work on. Don't worry friends. I'll challenge myself but will still listen to my gut feelings of risk.

I learnt about the accent challenge from the blogs The Everyday Goth and the Walrus Room. It was originally a Tumblr meme, but is now making it's way around some blogs. I think it's loads of fun, and so interesting to hear people's voices. Here's my post.
this is a love story for those not faint of heart, but rather for those curious in the torment of love and the fusion of pleasure and pain. and for the rare romantics whose idealistic view of love is defined in the submissive gesture of giving one's self away entirely for that of another. this is dark erotica as its best; passion wrapped in suffering.
and it's done.
The Pirates emerged from their nine game west coast trip with a 5-7 record; good for third place in the Central and a game better than I feared they would be after all the tough pitchers they’ve faced so far this year. This weekend, the first place (and Albert Pujols-less) Cardinals bring their 9-4 record to Pittsburgh for a three game set.
Small wonder: unless you were one of those select few who caught it in theaters originally or when they showed it on an endless loop on HBO in the Eighties, you wouldn't have seen this movie. In fact, most people my age that I mention this one to don't even so much as remember this movie.

But I got ahead of myself. The paint I planned to use for the bathroom was left over from the house in Small Town, but I wanted to tone it down a little. The colors were a little intense, so I planned to tone them down with a little white paint. Halfway through my masking job, I got sucked into paint mixing. The colors? So not going to work. Still WAY too intense. Very juvenile. The colors were okay in the old house where the bathroom was solely a kids' bathroom, but in this house, it is the main first floor bathroom and I was hoping for something a little more sophisticated. Well, as sophisticated as you can be with a monkey shower curtain!
Principles? As I wrote yesterday, under the heading "Integrity and Openness" (among Core Values), Forest City Enterprises states:
Our politicians lie to us with a straight face, insisting that we all benefit from immigration, that immigrants are the main victims of racism, and that what is happening to this country is not doing untold and possibly irreparable damage. Shameless falsehoods which even they can not really believe.
He also stated that the pursuit of wealth and economic gain was forbidden in Islam, as is any trade in pornographic material, drugs, and alcoholic beverages.

3. When it comes to water fun in the summer do you prefer the beach, pool, lake or sprinkler? I'm not a fan of public pools, house pools are too much upkeep. Sprinklers don't wet you enough. Most lakes have too much "crap" in them (particulates, living things, etc) but you could make the same argument for beaches. However, if you've had the particular luck of vacationing in the Caribbean you know that some of the most beautiful beaches are found here, particularly around the Grand Caymans. I would take those pristine white beaches and crystal clear waters over any pool, lake or sprinkler any day of the week.

I woven a turned herringbone fabric in Harrisville Shetland wool, Purple and Gold as I started my project after we knew who we were exchanging with. My original plan was to weave fabric to use to make one large Legionnare's bag. However once I had woven the fabric and done rigid heddle straps, I began to mock the bag up. I did not like the way that the reinforcement straps cut up to weave of the fabric, so I went to plan B. I had previosly asked Lady Siubhan, formerly of the Dragon's Embroidery Guild now back in Lochac, to send me a page from Anglo-Saxon Dress in England. The page I requested showed a satchel found with female remains. That page also showed a belt pouch found with some male remains. As luck would have it I had just enough fabric to make similar bags in my handwoven cloth, approximately 8" x 11 " each.

WHAT IT IS: A 5k run/walk (approximately 3.1 miles). You can run, walk, or skip. It’s up to you. There’s no time limit and there’s just one requirement: that you participate! You can do it inside or outside, on a treadmill or on a track, or even do a swim or a bike ride instead of running/walking – just get moving!
Time to back up a bit because much more has happened that I’ve skipped. The film opens at a factory with one of those signs counting the number of days since the last accident and we see a number in the 4000s taken down and replaced by the number 1. Next we are at Joe’s house after the funeral of Joe’s mother. Joe is outside alone while his friends are inside with other guests eating and Charles is worried about Joe’s involvement in his film project. Alice’s father Dainard (Ron Eldard) drives up to the house and enters. Moments later Joe’s father Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is angrily pushing Dainard back out of the house and arresting him. The reactions of anger and guilt fuelled by grief are more important part of this film than the story of the alien creature.

Having to fully comprehend on the truth behind the copyright protection law will ease out your worries about the said to be copyrights ruling over the public domain novels.

The brightest spots of the game for the Stags came when there were four shooters on the floor capable of dribble-driving to the basket. Instead of exploiting DeMatha’s deep guard play the game plan predictably focused on a methodical inside game that ultimately slowed down the works on both ends. Mike Jones is a great coach, but I’m wondering out loud here if he had to do it all over again would he stick with the zone defense against Shabazz Muhammad for so long? Mike is a friend of mine and I know that he can take the criticism, besides who hasn’t gotten drunk off the Stags?

I paired up with an older release from R.icielli, a high waist skirt so tight that it defies all sense and reason – but looks so nice we’ll completely forgive the absence of any visible zippers or buttons. The shading is magnificent, accentuating every curve with particularly nice shading on the backside. It comes complete with a cinch belt, although this is entirely optional, and the upper lip which draws out a little from the body making it all the more interesting.

What's next? That seems to be the burning question. Now that I've hit those 5 years of service, it seems like the only thing anyone can ask me about what I'm planning on doing next. No, I have not gotten my masters degree. The main reason is that I have NO CLUE as to what I want to study. I'm dutifully paying off my undergraduate student loans and am, unfortunately, not really eager to take on more debt any time soon. That's probably most of why I'm not too crazy about going back to school. I love the idea of going back to school, but not the reality.
Reflecting on the part of the Bersih 3 0 part was – a feeling of belonging that I have so many people like the feeling of joy, that has the size of the crowd and the growing thinking, see euphoria to sing together - I realized that the most intense moments in which the importance for all participants on the contrary will be distributed, could the speeches of the leaders are not a fraction of the value of singing “Negaraku” Overall, this is, in other words, the power comes from a collectively – that democracy is strongest democracy to achieve their ideal power distribution target for all people, which calls the philosopher Hegel, the “struggle for recognition” With the completion of humility that we only play a minor role in the whole revelation is appalling that we ultimately play a role Paradoxically importance of this role is not necessarily lost in small masses, but to get involved as part of all citizens in a democracy is to many of today play Bersih 3 0 had their civic duty in the country they love – even if their individual voices are not heard, unlike the archetypal hero of literary vision of the importance of individual heroism, but it is also evident in the force in the movement Bersih their number and not a single person – the large number of participants was the main reason he called Ambiga success before we disperse to advise on the need for the Commission will not hear the government and the elections, a few isolated voices, little is any validity, their arguments are, but you can not to ignore thousands of citizens who show more than in Kuala Lumpur, even if all you do is sit down and singing is the key question Bersih that a movement of civil society, from celebrities and politicians, to be bitten by press conferences, sound and visibility can, but all legitimate power, why the push for democracy, so that people can lose meaning finally removed by assuming the role they are to society in a rally like this each plays a small role, but by the Cross appointed, no longer endure

As the parent of a child with special needs, you’ve probably experienced the same sense of helplessness. Whether your child is critically or chronically ill, mentally or physically impaired, develop- mentally or behaviorally challenged, you want to do something. You want to ease your child’s pain, but you don’t know how. You want to help your child realize his or her full potential, but you don’t know where to begin. You want to ask God about your child’s suffering, but you don’t want to be condemned for questioning His wisdom. You want to believe God is with you, but you don’t know how to find Him.

Herman Cain poses an existential threat to the locked-in democratic votes of the black community.

“Who’s in the House” is a hip-hop track about the presence of the Lord.

Somewhere along the way, we ran across a kiosk selling day cruises down the river - sort of like the Bateau Mouche in Paris, which offers a great way to see key sights in the city in a relaxed, short ride for just $15SG per person.

So having a few paragraphs of description of a character, their life, family history, their personality, and why they believe that their kingdom is the most wonderful place to be and how they are going to convert everyone to this line of thinking is great and rich, I think that the belief of “My kingdom of Hynthral is a just and fair place, and I will not rest till the barbarians of the outlands see the light” gets lost in everything else.
Bend the 20-gauge copper wire up against the back of the copper disk. When the wire reaches the top of the disk, bend the wire around a mandrel to create a round ear wire. We used our favorite block as a mandrel, but we have also used a ring mandrel and you can use a kitchen broom, a round chain leg or any other round item that is about the size you need for an earring as a mandrel. Continue to bend the wire around the mandrel and then down parallel to the disks until the wire is just below the disks. The length of the wire will help balance the earrings when worn so they set nicely.

These casinos certainly have a considerably higher overhead than online casinos. This really is why a lot of poker sites have opened up on the internet. They can not possibly cost you the same quantity that genuine casinos cost since they undoubtedly aren’t operating a high maintenance and costly operation. This can be why rakebacks are actually possible in the first location. They're the on the net poker room earnings that could be provided back again to excellent customers as an incentive to keep actively playing in their rooms. Take into account it bribe dollars since rakebacks are distinct from one web page to an additional. There is a web site that does not even offer you rakebacks simply since it is currently well-liked among game enthusiasts.

This is a rather curious statement given that the minority of doctors who support assisted suicide and euthanasia have been trying to change BMA policy for years, and have been consistently unsuccessful precisely because they do not represent the more widely held viewpoint that doctors should not be involved in assisted suicide and euthanasia and that any law legalising either practice would pose grave dangers for vulnerable elderly and disabled people.

Also, the meat sauce isn't your typical American one either, the recipe calls for a dash of cinnamon, a clove berry, and some nutmeg in the béchamel sauce. Fancy smancy, eh?!

The major draw for this Broadway boutique is, well besides its cuteness factor, is price point says Sara. Most everything is under $38! For a handbag or pair of shoes lately, that is an absolute steal! If you are in the market for a pair of summer sandals or wedges, this is where you need to go. Also, every first Friday of the month she hosts a champagne evening from 5-8 pm. So, now that we are into May, that means THIS Friday! She also let me in on a little secret too, this Friday she is having a major sale to make room for new merchandise. Buy 3 pairs of shoes for only $77! That’s less than one pair at Aldo! I know many of you have already discovered this hot spot, but for those of you who haven’t yet made it in, the approaching holidays are a good excuse. My mom loves this store!

His voice lowered as they reached the edge of his camp. “No one really knows. Some say that he killed her. Others say that she disappeared with him into the night. But, on autumn nights, when the moon is full and the winds are high, they say that you can hear his dark laughter on the wings of night.” He stopped and smiled down at her. “And that, Briana, is why beautiful young girls are not to be traipsing about in the night where gypsies might kidnap them.”

Did I mention he is like me so this is hitting a little too close to my heart. So all my holding back because it won’t really turn out right is staring me in the face. On my knees in prayer for this little boy came a prompting. I don’t know what each day will bring but I need to do my best with it and with God my best will be enough. I’m going to express gratitude for Heath’s efforts in doing his best even if he isn’t THE best at something. I have a talent for surrounding myself with very talented people. I tend to float through using their talents because they can do it better anyway. Well they can, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do it. I may never be the BEST at anything but just because someone is more talented doesn’t mean I’m not good. I need to jump back into life and do my best, It takes faith to get out of the boat!

“The responding officer coded the incident as a simple assault, despite their assertions that at least 30 people had participated in the attack,” Washington explains. “A reporter making routine checks of police reports would see ‘simple assault’ and, if the names were unfamiliar, would be unlikely to write about it. In this case, editors hesitated to assign a story about their own employees. Would it seem like the paper treated its employees differently from other crime victims?”

New Bandoleer collection was inspired by the iconic bullet belts in military wear, super heavy & beefy appearance can compare with the original factory strap. This new Bandoleer curve end bracelet is special made for 44mm PANERAI watch which fits perfectly. A total of 20 solid 316L stainless steel links compose the bracelet and gleam with a subtle brush finish. An ideal aftermarket replacement band for Panerai watch.

There are said to be 108 energy lines, or nadis, converging to form the heart chakra. Marma points are like Chakras, or intersection of energy, with fewer converging energy lines. On Sri Yantra, the Marmas have 54 intersecting energy lines where three lines intersect. Each has feminine, or shakti, and masculine, or shiva, qualities. 54 X 2 = 108. Therefore there are 108 points that define the human body and the Sri Yantra or the Yantra of Creation. The same rule is observed in the Sanskrit language, with its 54 letters, both representing the two genders and they are also called Shiva and Shakti respectively; again, 54 X 2= 108.
By the time we had collected our luggage and gotten through the airport it was after midnight, and then we had to figure out the queue structure, and watch while our taxi driver was unable to get our three suitcases into the taxi. At last, with one suitcase in the trunk, and two riding with us plus the driver in the small, four passenger car, we set off for our hotel, selected by Expedia for its closeness to the airport.
Let me make clear that fee income is a very flakey way of measuring success. I wish I had a pound (no, let’s make it £1.50 and increase it to £1.75 next week for no justifiable reason…) for every time a barrister suggested “progressing” their practice by increasing their charging rate. Increase the rate to increase income, an obvious route to success – provided you are operating in a completely ignorant marketplace. Perhaps this was once the case but right now the legal marketplace is anything but ignorant and indeed is rapidly increasing in sophistication. This sort of short-term approach to fees can be extremely damaging, particularly in the earlier years of practice and any modicum of commercial reasoning dictates that it should be resisted. The fact is that the market will dictate the sort of fees you can charge and if you can progress to the right areas of the market, the work will attract higher fees. But you have to do the hard work to get there first.

How do you practice building relationships? All you have to do is evaluate your current relationships and see where you can implement some of the principles discussed so far. If I asked your friends would they say that you are a good listener? You can also work on developing new relationships. Short or long term relationships can be developed every day. Where do you get your coffee in the morning? Do you know the name of the person who gets it for you? What about the receptionist at work? What do you know about her?
If you're not familiar with Graeme Base, it's time you met. To call his illustrations rich is a gross understatement. They're vibrant with color and detail. While all his books are worth your time, Animalia is my favorite. It is an ode to alliteration. Each drawing moves through the alphabet, illustrating the primary subject (ex. Great Green Gorillas Growing Grapes in a Gorgeous Glass Greehouse) as well as hiding in the scene dozens of similar starting objects.

Fifteen minutes later I was parked and walking to the South Philly Tap Room! They were tapping their keg of PtY at 2:00, and I got in just ahead of time -- "Lock that door!" someone joked as I walked in (do you think they wished I'd stayed away, dear Diary?!) -- and was happy to find my friend Christine Gumpper there, who offered me a seat at her table of friends, so I got to meet Derek and Dave, too! And just like that...it was Pliny Time again! We got PtY all around, and what do you think, Diary? It was just as astonishingly the third time around! Wow! The bar was buzzing with excitement.

The 1977 BBC version of 'Count Dracula' began my love affair with vampires when I was a girl. Brad -King of Finding Me All The Films and TV Shows I Long For - found it while we were in Toronto two weeks ago. I nearly kissed him right there at Sunrise Records! Warning if you watch it - the 1977 thing is unfortunate in the video effect department. But the casting is perfect for Van Helsing, Mina, Lucy and Renfield, and the acting is top notch. Jonathan Harker usually has a way of coming across as what Brad referred to as a 'wuss', which is bizarre considering the first half is really through his POV. No matter what version of Dracula, Harker has the same problem. I'd love to see yet another version made, because Harker deserves to be a cooler character. And I have yet to see the perfect Dracula. I'll be searching for him till I find him.
I have seen many relationships end although I have never seen a relationship (affair or not) that one person is solely to blame. From reading through your blog I would have to say it seems like there were a lot of issues but they were not dealt with (if there weren’t I don’t think you would have the issues you are having today). And now you have been left and feel betrayed and feel a huge need to blame and accuse.

We were able to do a blind taste test of some of these kids soups (chicken and stars & princess shapes). We tasted the original soup and the lower sodium variety. I got one right and one wrong. It was really hard to tell the difference. I don't know how they kept the flavor so good without artificial ingredients or MSG, but they did, and kids will love the taste while you love the lower sodium content.

The 307 asserts its individuality for the last time as it turns down Green Street and quite close to Enfield Town FC’s ground. Enfield has as many if not more component parts than Barnet so the two ends of the trip complemented each other quite well. Though Brimsdown has a station (and how well we know it) its main function seems to be as home to a range of light and not so light industry – we actually photographed a ‘smoking chimney’ of the industrial as opposed to domestic variety on the day that the Prime minister welcomed the establishment of yet more Starbucks and ‘drive in’ ones at that as a welcome addition and ‘a great boost’ to the British Economy – industry used to mean manufacturing and factories, even if many of them were not in London.

I used to do this a lot in university. I often had gaps of a few hours between classes and when I wasn't working on an assignment or reading in the public library I was people-watching. I used to sit in a chair in a public area of the local shopping centre and make up stories about the people walking past. Not like "that man is a student on his way to grab some lunch before a lecture" but things like "That man is an art student on his way to a studio where he's working on his latest piece. He dreams of being a painter but for now he's stuck working in an art supply shop at the weekends. He was picked on at school and channelled his frustration out on canvas. His parents didn't approve but in the end allowed him to do what makes him happy."

For nearly two years, Rio de Janeiro’s utilities, traffic systems, and emergency services has been managed by a single “Ops Center,” a huge hub of technologies provided by both IBM and Cisco. With 300 LCD screens spread across 100 rooms, connected via 30,000 meters of fiber optic cable, Ops Center staff monitor live video from 450 cameras and three helicopters, and track the location of 10,000 buses and ambulances via GPS. Other screens output the current weather, and simulations of tomorrow’s weather up to 150 miles from the city — and yet more screens display heatmaps of disease outbreaks, and the probability of natural disasters like landslides. There’s even a Crisis Room, which links the Ops Center to Rio’s mayor and Civil Defense departments via a Cisco telepresence suite.
Are you a mover around of things or a changer of furniture? For those decor, interior and furnishing junkies amongst us... I think you get my drift... I believe you know what I am talking about... I am most definitely a lover of change... in life and at home. I find it dull if I don't re-think our furniture and objects arrangement at least a couple of times a year... Mostly it's the objects because after a while furniture finds it's rightful place... and besides it is far too heavy... I have learnt through experience that when I am in 'moving mode' it is far better to do it myself or pay someone who doesn't know me... They have to listen to my just-another-inch-to-the-left talk... my darling doesn't... He is lovely but moving the house around on my decorative whim is not his idea of fun... The same could be said of hanging and re-hanging pictures... that is a sure fire way to create plenty of simmering tension... again, the whole two inches higher, one inch lower conversation is never a crowd pleaser when discussing home handy work... The problem is really all mine... because when I get these crazy ideas... I want to change or do or move asap... An impetuous perfectionist... that's me... a disastrous combination to live with if you prefer the status quo...

Gichuki Francis built his organization from the ground up over the last ten years. He operates TYSA (Trans-Nzoia Youth Sports Association) on his family’s pasture land outside of town, about 15 miles north of Kitale, Kenya. His father managed to acquire this land through 40 years of squatting around the time of Kenya’s independence. Francis was the 6th of 9 children, and the beneficiary of a good solid education from primary school straight through to Kenyan university. Gichuki, like Michael Jordan, has a degree in geography he doesn’t use. Other than his Kenyan education, he has no obvious “capacity building” experiences, such as living in another country or working for years at an NGO. Most of what Gichuki knows, he has learned from experience. He is a great listener and student of life – and absorbs knowledge from his surroundings at faster rate than everyone else. I think that is why he is successful.

But was she telling the truth or just trying to embellish her story for money? After her story was revealed, Judith was called everything from a party girl, to a call girl in various biographies of JFK. What better way to bolster her reputation than to claim that her real reason for hanging out with mobsters was because she was a go-between for the President of the United States? Sounds much better than just being a woman who fell for inappropriate men, who liked to walk a little bit on the wild side doesn’t it? Her story also dovetailed neatly with the conspiracy theorists who believe that the mob was involved with JFK’s death. The revelations that the CIA had hired Roselli and Giancana to help assassinate Castro also lent credence to her story.
When the pain becomes a memory
The campaign for Cantor’s “small business” bill was notable for the absolute absence of any talk of offsets. Boehner praised the Republican proposal to pay for lower student loan rates by slicing money from an “Obamacare slush fund” (a designation labeled a “Pants on Fire” lie by PolitiFact — in reality, it’s the Department Health and Human Services will use establish prevention and public health programs) for “not adding a dime to the deficit.” Meanwhile, Cantor’s jobs bill provoked not a squeak about deficits or borrowing. It wasn’t that Cantor tried to pass off a tax cut as a revenue-booster; he simply didn’t offer any explanation at all, and no one – neither Republican nor Democrat – called him out on it. I can understand why the GOP would be reluctant to point out this inconsistency, but where were Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi? For that matter, where was David Axelrod? While leading Republicans were tweeting about the president eating dog meat, the Obama team could have been calling attention to this rank hypocrisy. After insisting that one tax cut be offset, why weren’t Republicans proposing to offset the latest tax cut as well? It proves Steve Benens’s tart observation that conservatives are not interested in real debt reduction: “It’s almost as if Republicans panicking about an alleged “debt crisis” don’t really believe their own rhetoric, and only use the line to rationalize brutal cuts to domestic investments that they oppose anyway.”

Since there are two sizes, the diaper is very trim. There are still 3 rise settings for each diaper so you can really customize the fit. Size one would be great for newborns! One size diapers are so bulky at that stage. I would have loved to have these for both of our sons. Our youngest grew out of his newborn diapers in a month!
This article takes on a mid-style, particularly in the tone and language; however, it does retain some faint traces of high style through the sheer amount of references used. The general tone taken is a very informal voice filled with a lot of familiarity. Phrases like “That ain’t right” and “What the hell happened?” add to the conversational feel, making it more like a discussion between friends than a formal article. The article itself does not even have an author, with gives it the feeling of being written by anyone, so the reader can almost put themselves in to the writer’s shoes and take on the persona and the ideas. Some level of high style is retained in the sports references used throughout the piece. Although some are straightforward, such as referencing sunflower seeds or the Yankees and Mets rivalry, a huge amount of names dating back into the history of baseball fill the article, requiring a more experience baseball fanatic well versed in the game’s history. Despite this, the jokes are still funny, reference understood or not, retaining the average reader interested in humor, a common theme among their articles.

I'm not blowing me own trumpet, I'm just using this blog to document a good time in my life because one thing I've learnt about this acting lark is that at any moment it can go deathly quiet. You never have time to savour these moments because you have to keep your head down and keep going, this blog is all I have, apart from my feeble memory that is.
Neutral: They pop in to say hi, or give us the equivalent of an interplanetary “whats doin?”. Wow, we declare, aliens! Who’d a thunk it. Life goes on as normal. They may also become a mild nuisance, spamming our airwaves, or sticking around a la District 9, bloodsucking off our bloated socialist welfare systems and contributing to violent crime and culture degeneration. They could also steal our jobs. Damn foreigners.
Ok, rant over about money. This is the longest post (in effort to make up for all the lost days of my non-existence here)
You made apple and quince pancakes with quinoa flour for breakfast. That recipe needs tweaking but it was fancy enough to satisfy your need for weekend food pizzaz.

Alas, this post has descended into nonsense once again. Oh well. I will tackle my Get Stuff Done list, and maybe one day I will finally earn my ‘adult’ stripes.

- Find a cafe/bistro with a killer view and stake a table out near sunset. My love and I found a streetside bistro with an unbelievable view of the Eiffel Tower and we sipped on artsy-sounding drinks while watching the clouds turn glorious shades of pinks and blues and purples. Oh, and when the sun finally went down and the Eiffel Tower lit up, it was all kinds of amazing.

I received one of my rudest revisions when I saw a special broadcast of an episode of the Doctor Who serial Tomb of the Cybermen. It was a shocker to see the crudity of the sets, the woeful quality of the ham acting and the excruciatingly rough props. An "x-ray laser" pistol prop looked like a piece of jaggedly-sawn water pipe taped to a piece of scrap plastic which, naturally, was exactly what it was.

It’s even tougher now that I’m still avoiding soy…I have to make changes to recipes or buy more expensive items. I’m making due, though. I’ve been soy free and low fat for over a month now and I haven’t had any stomach pain, which is nice. I have been branching out and trying a few things with soy lecithin in it and so far that hasn’t bothered me. I’m convinced it’s an oil thing as some people can handle lecithin and not the oil. Either way, I’m feeling a lot healthier now that I’m eating more homemade things without preservatives and giving up the junk food.

The décor is pink and flowery—sort of like being on the inside of a sponge cake (yes, please). Petite and tidy, a cushy window seat overlooking Allen Street is the only place to sit in-house.
I cheated! Well sorta. I read a book without any words. It was beautiful though, and a nice break from text. I've got 52 pages left in Code Name Verity so I'll definitely finish that by my next update. I'm having stomach pain though so I'm going to take a break now.

A writer friend of mine calls these “said-bookisms” and they are evil. Here are a few examples of said-bookisms:
We made the fillings first, and let them cool/set up while we made the cookies. The cookies were the more precise piece of the puzzle. They are made from almond meal and powdered sugar, which is made into a paste with egg whites (egg whites that are four days old, mind you, so advanced planning is needed!). Then an Italian meringue (sugar syrup + egg whites) is folded into the almond paste, and then, interestingly, Chef Briony instructed us to "macaronage" - beat the batter so it forms a ribbony, shiny dough. In other words, after making such a fluffy meringue, we beat all the air out of it!

Thoughts on the dance scenes in the new one?
05.13: Vaxjo, Sweden
“I’m glad you asked me that,” she said.“Because it’s not true. What I said was, I want to be left alone.”
But then the performance is over, and everyone heads over to a bar to hang out. On better days, I love this. Have a few drinks, relax, get silly, dance a bit, laugh a lot. But last night, the drink just made me tired, not relaxed. I didn’t want any more. I wasn’t hungry, and just watched as everyone else had munchies. I saw others laughing, and felt myself smiling, but I was getting so tired. Someone next to me was speaking, and I had no idea what they were saying. I could hear the sounds, but I could not make sense of it. I was too tired. I yawn and try to excuse myself, thinking no one wants my quiet, downer presence. But I get many arguments, and pushed back in my seat – I’m not allowed to leave yet they say! They want me there. I love it, and I smile, but I really just want to go, but don’t want to be rude either. I yawn a few more times, and say my goodbyes, getting hugs and thank yous. The quiet cold night is such relief after the noisy bar, and I practically run to the van. I have a tiny cry in the safety of my van, just to relieve what was building up, then drive home. Completely satisfied. For me, this was a hugely successful day.

An infinity of existence,
There have been a few dog walks - we managed another lengthy walk from our Kiddiwalks book - it was a lovely hot day and we really enjoyed the Suffolk countryside around Wyverstone -
Strawberries and grapes (fresh fruit is always nice).
Me and my boyfriend (well me) decided to do a Disney night where we would watch our favourite Disney films. Unfortunately we couldn’t find all of them, the attic is a dark and scary place, so we made do with the ones that were within our reach: Snow White, Lady and the Tramp (one of my favourites), Fantasia (my boyfriend’s favourite, I was alright for the first 30 mins until I looked at the back of the DVD and saw how long the entire thing was) and Beauty and the Beast. What goes better with films than popcorn? I stumbled upon this recipe when I was flicking through Lorraine Pascale’s “Home cooking made easy” recipe book and thought it sounded fun and simple, which it is.

That, I'm afraid, is my failure. It is a white-hot spear of pain I will carry inside me always. I don't know that he will ever fully know or anyone else will ever understand how hard I tried. When it got to the point that loving him was hurting me, I had to leave. It felt like a matter of survival. I didn't want to do it. I still worry about how he's doing.
you may have seen this in my last post and wondered what it was?
So there you have it in a nutshell. Homemaking can be a dynamic career choice. Whether you use your time at home to learn as much as you can so you home produce and cook from scratch, or you're busy in the child raising years, or if you combine both, you can be rewarded for your efforts. There are many small ways to save money at home, they all take time and consistency but all those small ways add up. If you use the time you spend in your home not only for cooking, cleaning, raising children, mending, recycling etc., but also actively engaged in saving money, you will help provide for the family and pay off debt just as much as the partner who works outside the home.

Favorite North Shore Restaurant: This winner also has a killer Bolognese and Arancini, making it a worthy choice for dinner. 62 Restaurant & Wine Bar in Salem is gaining lots of recognition for its cuisine and the kudos are well deserved. Plus, they are bold enough to have an all Italian wine list, including plenty of interesting choices.This is another restaurant I need to dine at again very soon.
Pumpkins-would love to cover my porch with pumpkins all fall but they are sort of expensive, planting my own should help.
Did you say yes to the play because you were interested in it and will enjoy doing? Or because someone else wanted you in the cast? If it was the first reason - go for it, I say. But if it was for the second reason then my opinion is twofold (1) You need to say 'no' at times, and (2) You must be a really nice person to do it for someone else. Whatever the reason I hope you have a great time. Mum-me
The police, in five of the cases before court, agreed to pay R190 000 in damages to five of the security guards. The cases of the others are still due to go before court.
I love when the forecasters are wrong. Sunday originally was supposed to be rainy, but instead we ended up with sun! I didn't want to waste any of it so I headed outside to start working on the area we are going to put the chicken coop. My husband was only a week post op from his surgery and couldn't help. Sweet Pea had run a 5K the day before and then played a very rough indoor soccer game (a teammate of her's ended up with a broken rib) that morning so she didn't last too long. While she was there we got quite a bit done. Then I was left on my own, but it was worth all the work knowing why I was doing it.
Anyhow. So, in college, after hitting a peak weight of around 142, I lost weight (yay, Jerusalem Diet!) and kept it mostly off until I got married, went to India, and gained most of it all back. Darn the delicious food! Ah, I wouldn’t take any of it back for the world.
Walk. Play. Love.

I immediately went on-line and ordered the book. Two days later I was sitting on my couch wrapped in a blanket, after the kids went to bed, totally absorbed into her novel. It is a great book - lots of twists and turns. I loved all the inside references to DC landmarks and local hangouts. In record time, after some late nights, I finished the book just three days later. I have already passed it on and plan to keep passing it around to friends and family. I recommend it to anyone looking for an intriguing story about prosecutors and defense attorneys and a murder mystery.
I carefully cut out everything except for the cheese. OH and I threw in the ketchup at the last minute. It's just some wavy lines. If you want it at all.

Kate: “If you like mint and are addicted to lip balm, this is the perfect solution. It provides a cool, tingling sensation and makes your lips incredibly smooth. A bonus is the mint flavor which keeps your breath and lips smelling like you’ve just brushed your teeth. It’s made with 100% natural mint and has SPF 15.”

After I enjoyed my breakfast (with a little help from Arden, of course!) of a bagel with cream cheese and watermelon, I was able to get up and get showered and dressed all alone. Then I came downstairs to a perfectly clean house as we headed out to church! William took care of the boys as much as he could at church and let me relax.
