8. Unfinished, unpermitted home additions. They're easy to spot: an enclosed carport with an air-conditioning unit stuck in the wall; the outline of what used to be the garage door in a new room. Sometimes rooms don't have heat or air-conditioning systems; some don't even have electricity. When you try to sell your home, your appraiser won't count this kind of half-baked addition in the square footage, so your asking price goes down.

Lena Dunham's 'Girls': She's the twentysomething auteur of the moment (every decade needs one), and her new HBO series could rack up tidy profits if the network had a dollar for every time the words "revolutionary" or "Sex and the City" were invoked in its wake.

"Back in the '60s, I loved the songs I was writing, like 'Wild Thing' or 'Angel of the Morning,' but I would never think of me singing them," he explained. "When I came back, the songs were more from my own experiences, and I felt like playing them.

One of the selections, the Elvis Presley classic "Hound Dog," could have been mistaken as a shout-out to Boehner and other Republicans who have begun to take aim at parts of the job package.

The clear and literal message of the ad was not political, much less partisan. It was, as Mr. Eastwood explained later, one of optimism. The ad was a pep talk for the American people, meant to reawaken our competitive spirits and help pull us out of the deepest recession since World War II. Detroit's auto industry came back from the brink, and if it can, so can the rest of the nation. "If Obama or any other politician wants to run with the spirit of that ad, go for it," Mr. Eastwood said on Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor."
Workers on Monday discovered an influx of the creatures, called salp, clogging screens that are used to keep marine life out of the sea water used as a coolant, Cuddy said.

For the past several months, Mom has been complaining nonstop about how "awful" Beth is. She says things at the most random times to people she barely knows.

Smith was once thought of as an up-and-comer in the coaching ranks after leading Louisville to a 41-21 record over five seasons, including five straight bowl appearances. His star never shined brighter than in 2003 when he was named the Big Ten Coach of the Year for leading Michigan State to an 8-5 record in his first season. The win total was most by a first-year coach in the Spartans’ history, but things went quickly downhill.

Whatever the size, a bountiful table is a thing of beauty. Think of your tasting as a way to stimulate the taste buds by engaging all the senses. Let tasters taste not just wine and cheese, but their natural relationship to grapes, olives, honeycomb, pears, cured meats, breads, candied ginger, quince paste, plain almonds or fresh figs – all vibrantly colored, edible decorations.
And there are still plenty of diners who are more than happy to share a table.

McTeer, so convincingly cocky as Mr. Page, is the film's glue, and Wasikowska is its lyrical heart.

Can Rick Santorum win the Republican nomination? Sure. He’s leading in the polls nationally and in important states — and he’s doing so without so much as a campaign headquarters. Imagine what might happen if Santorum pulls off a few more stunning upsets.

Villaraigosa's stand is not new. When we met back in 1995, his first year in the California Assembly, he was enthusiastically, energetically and, yes, severely liberal.

Rob Portman, Ohio's other U.S. senator, just won election last November, and the poll shows his job approval from Ohioans is on the rise. Portman, a Republican, has a 40 percent job approval rating, barely a blip above the 39 percent "Don't Know." But that's a 10 point gain since March, when Portman's approval was 30 percent, and it's nearly double his 21 percent disapproval rating.

Leaving aside the fact that a 219-212 vote in the House hardly constitutes a “strong majority,” the Obama assertion that it would be unprecedented for the court to find a piece of legislation unconstitutional suggests Professor Obama must have been a pretty lousy constitutional law teacher. Since 1803, the central task of the Supreme Court has been to act as a check on legislation it deems unconstitutional.

Language isn't everything in acting—for proof, look no further than "The Artist"—and the odds are against Mr. Oldman beating out George Clooney, Jean Dujardin or Brad Pitt. Nor is Kenneth Branagh likely to win in the supporting actor category; he's up against Jonah Hill, an American whose vocal range is dwarfed by an emotional range that he conveys with droll understatement. (He's also up against Christopher Plummer, a masterful Canadian with acting chops indistinguishable from the English variety.)

For example, Hewitt found that 46 percent of employers that do not already offer automatic portfolio rebalancing are likely to add this feature to their workers' retirement plans. With this tool, portfolios are regularly rebalanced so that an employee's retirement assets meet their own targeted asset allocation. I'm a big fan of these tools because they help maintain a diversified mix of assets without the employees having to worry about when or how to change the allocation. Far too many employees just set and forget their workplace retirement plans, which can result in their taking more risks than they may want.

The dreams are, as you would expect, marvels of computer-generated effects, but also marvels of Nolan's imagination (he also wrote the script).

These can range from amusing to deadly.
Young was the first witness called by prosecutors Monday. The former aide is key to making the government's case that Edwards masterminded the effort to use nearly $1 million in secret payments from wealthy campaign donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.

Three hours before Friday's state semifinal against Avon, Mihalik and I talked in an empty Aurora classroom about how much he liked McGhee, and how awful he felt for McGhee's family, the football team, the school and the community in which Mihalik lives.

NHTSA officials used the exclusions as part of their rationale to close at least five of the investigations without finding any defect, because -- with fewer incidents to consider -- the agency concluded there were not enough reported problems to warrant further inquiry. In a 2003 Lexus probe, for example, the agency threw out all but one of 37 customer complaints cited in a defect petition. It then halted further investigation, saying it "found no data indicating the existence of a defect trend."
Her grandmother was nearby, the girl said, and then she started crying. Cordova also wept.
The Minaj brand is an adventure in rainbow bright colors such as lime green, bright pink and electric blue — sometimes all at once. Puffy ponytails, shaped Afros, a below the shoulders sleek mane in half blond and half blue are just a few of the duo’s greatest hits. Davidson cuts, colors and archives each wig at his home and makes multiples of her most popular styles. In recent months, his work has been getting a lot of exposure.
Inside politics: Forget Politics 101. For an in-depth look at the underbelly of politics, the University of Akron offers a 14-week course beginning next week entitled "Campaign Battleground."
There's no need to wax on about the natural beauty of Pennsylvania or the boundless potential of its people. That's boilerplate.
There really was a Joseph Mortimer Granville who did invent a mechanical device known as "Granville's Hammer," but "Hysteria" is not a historical biopic, says director Tanya Wexler.
Last year, Tomback proposed a 3 percent pay increase for all employees, plus two step raises for eligible teachers to make up for the one they did not get in 2010. The county executive and council did not make additional funds available for the raises; however, and the teachers union has the issue in arbitration.
As the contenders set off Saturday, one by one, on the stage that would decide the overall winner, Evans stared straight ahead, his face blank. Evans knew that although he had been the most consistent rider in this race, he had 26 miles, a blip in cycling, to close the gap.
She was the 20th century’s most famous sex symbol, but what Marilyn Monroe promised wasn’t really sex. It was maternal warmth and gentle acceptance, soft understanding and sweet forgiveness.
Officials say the 75-year-old woman had injuries that "resembled rat bites," and they speculated that she may have fallen and become trapped under trash. "When her 76-year-old husband tried to come to her aid, he apparently became trapped as well," according to a May 25 article in the Chicago Tribune. "The stench was so strong that fire personnel had to don hazardous material suits." FOR THE RECORD:
Pollution might aggravate a whole range of conditions; for instance in someone with preexisting cardiovascular problems, it might lead to a thickening of the blood vessels through a process of stress and a number of biochemical changes. This can trigger a number of problems in the body, depending again on which organ system you're talking about.
The PUC report echoed many of those findings in identifying a series of laws it said PG&E had broken. At the core, it said, was a failure by PG&E's management "to foster a culture that valued safety over profits."
With an emphasis on the cosmetic, this new stadium personifies the wretched but entertaining excess of South Beach. That's why I like it, because the venue is absolutely right for this market. In that context, it's a success.
The White House has cautioned anyone against drawing conclusions from the justices' lines of questioning.
"Meeting people, meeting other players, getting to compete in this kind of ballpark," Greene said, listing the benefits of attending the workouts. He has previously attended workouts with Atlanta and Tampa Bay. "It's kind of exciting. I'm kind of nervous, too. You wonder where you're going to go."
As an experienced home baker, I was well aware of the travails of this cake: It rises (and falls, oh, yeah) on the expertise of beating 12 egg whites into submission, with some help from cream of tartar. There's no butter. No oil. No baking powder. (And God knows there's no chocolate.) In other words: There is no safety net.

The Spartans led 22-14 and seemed to be settling in when Michael Culpo hit a 3-pointer for LIU before Green countered with a three-point play to give Michigan State a 25-17 lead. After LIU cut to 25-21, Izzo greeted senior guard Brandon Wood coming off the floor for a timeout.
Feng Mao Owner Jin Chun-Hua and her husband hail from China's Jilin province, a northeastern state that borders North Korea, and yang rou chuan, grill-them-yourself Beijing-style spiced mutton skewers, is the restaurant's headliner. Give the mutton an extra dip in an accompanying bowl of a cumin-driven spice mix and it becomes even better. Chicken, squab and quail are on the menu, as are assorted cuts of pork and beef. Most non-mutton skewers are available à la carte, which is good for offal eaters eyeing kidney, heart, liver and even bull penis skewers, the last of which arrives as tough, tiny slices that are best left to Feng Mao's most curious customers.
Here's a closer look at saving strategies:
Authorities declined to identify the roommate because he is a victim of a sex crime. They also would not provide his age, say in which dorm attack occurred or say whether it occurred on the Livingston or Busch campus, both of which are in Piscataway.
Q: I have, but I left it at home. I don't have it to refer to right now.
"I'm of the belief that if somebody has an emergency, they need to turn the sirens on," Conrad said. "Also, the firefighters will only be there over the summer, and most people have their houses closed up with air conditioning and wouldn't hear sirens anyway."

In all, there were primaries in Virginia, Vermont, Ohio, Massachusetts, Georgia, Tennessee and Oklahoma. Caucuses in North Dakota, Idaho and Alaska rounded out the calendar.
Coping with frustration becomes part of the natural evolution from high school stud who could take over any game any time he wished to collegiate novice who must realize that he's now just one of many quality players. The experience gained from this can only make Kearney and Trice wiser and more even-tempered next season.
Hennepin County Board Chair Mike Opat, who has laid low during the Arden Hills debate, on Wednesday said that his county's involvement in helping fund a Minneapolis stadium may come down to timing.

A water pressure test Thursday revealed indications of what the company had previously called a pinhole-sized leak somewhere on the line, the same pipe that exploded last year in San Bruno.
Initially asked if he had been able to discern anything about Sargent as a football player, McElwain smiled and said: "He's a great kid. A wonderful kid." Later, he added: "Here's the deal. We've evaluated film. The guy's made a lot of plays. He's got to get himself healthy. I can't answer for any of those guys who are injured because we weren't able to see them on film (this spring)."
Other starters weren't as successful. Tom yum soup ($3.95) lacked a characteristic pucker, and tod mun fish cakes ($3.95/half, $6.50/whole order) were flabby.
"Sometimes I come and I'm the only one here," he said.
øIn terms of novelty, "Little Deviants" has several mini-games that utilize the new rear-touch screen. In one variety, you must move your finger along the back of the device to deform the landscape. It is as if the screen is made of clay, and you are molding the landscape by pushing it from underneath. The object is to roll a Deviant around by creating hills and valleys so that it passes over keys that unlock the level-ending vortexes. Before rolling the Deviant into the vortex, you will want to collect stars that earn you bonus points.
The country format is no guarantee, however. Weymouth will face stiff competition from Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill, which opened last year at Mesa Riverview, only several miles away from AZ Country.

I already had shredded Gruyère cheese at home, but this works with most any similar cheese: fontina, Swiss, cheddar or pepper jack if you like a little spice.
Start your day at this neighborhood cafe and bakery with a bowl of the organic steel-cut oatmeal ($4.89). The less-than-400-calorie dish includes cranberries, golden raisins, almond-infused cream, brown sugar and a whole-wheat cinnamon-raisin-nut crouton.

For Girl & the Goat chef/partner Stephanie Izard, the reason behind her bread-baking program was simple. "We wanted to try and make as much in-house as possible," she says. Plus, she adds, "We didn't want to serve the same bread that other restaurants in the city were serving."
Burnett said the problem was all about mechanics.
Federal officials said their investigation is continuing.
In the week before March 10, Brown and his surrogates had started a new line of attack against the federation's measure: Because it dedicated all new revenue it raised to schools and local governments, it did nothing to stave off deeper cuts to health and welfare programs.
In any case, everybody's professing to be pleased as punch (packaged in a stainless-steel thermos, naturally) about the new requirements.
The top spot in the market share for the sports talkers continues to bounce between WXOS's afternoon drive-time show (Bob Ramsey, Randy Karraker and D'Marco Farr) and its midday show with Bernie Miklasz. The offering with the trio of hosts was at the top this time, drawing 5.1 percent of the sports-talk market. Miklasz followed at 4.5. It's the third straight quarter they have been 1-2, with the order flipped in each - Miklasz was No. 1 in the summer, the afternoon show at the top in the spring.
"It would be odd for a Christian to say Jesus Christ is not as important as the Buddha, or for a Buddhist to say we can give up on the Buddha for the light of the Torah," said William Schweiker, director of the Martin Marty Center and professor of theological ethics at the University of Chicago Divinity School. "We're talking about traditions that by their very nature have to claim to be ultimate."
Dennis or Randy Quaid? Randy
"Especially this year," her husband chimes in.
But sometimes there's no great pitching matchup to command the focus and no dominant slugger to allow the writer to get a head start on his essay. So the columnist ("beleaguered" is the proper adjective here) has to wait to see what turns up. Deadlines prevent waiting until the game is over to write the column, so keys clickey-clack through the game.
There's a decent chance the Bulls can beat Philadelphia in a seven-game series without Rose, but that wasn't the goal heading into the season. The goal was to avenge their loss to the Heat in last year's Eastern Conference finals and win an NBA championship.
"The parish wanted to sell that house," Morrisett said, adding that Feliciano and his family were excited about moving to their own home in Easton. "It was the American Dream for them," she testified.

For a series that started off so poorly, and in a place where Oakland has had so little success in recent years, the A's did quite all right at Fenway Park this week.
File this one under the category marked: it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Go see Godzilla in Phoenix: Hideki "Godzilla" Matsui, the Angels' designated hitter from last year (and his large scrum of Japanese media), has moved on to the Oakland A's and its venerable spring home at Phoenix Municipal Stadium. Also with the A's this spring, the Angels heartburn-with-a-mitt closer from last year, Brian Fuentes. "Muni" is now the oldest park in the Cactus League, opening in 1964 as the spring home of Oakland's cross-bay rivals, the San Francisco Giants. The park has great Southwestern flavor, with the beautiful red rocks in nearby Papago Park looming over the left field wall.
"He's just a great guy to be around," Habben said.
Lucas on Sunday evening passed away in Portland with his family by his side after a two-year battle with bladder cancer. He was 58.
We literally have politicians picking their voters, instead of voters choosing their politicians. Instead of elections being decided by the voters on Election Day, the outcome is decided by the politicians years before the election.

"That's Margaret, that's her personality," Senser said, referring to Amy by her middle name. He testified that she isn't erratic, as Russell put it, but rather "fiercely independent."
"The first three (innings) I was trying to get the first time through the lineup with just fastballs, but they swinging and putting it where our guys weren't. I started mixing it up later with curveballs and sliders."

"The discoveries it enabled, the international cooperation it fostered and the knowledge it gained -- often at great human cost -- has also contributed in countless, important ways to humanity and our common progress," President Bush wrote The Associated Press in an email. Bush oversaw the program's early days as vice president, a job that has by tradition supervised NASA.
Approaching by car, you find yourself on a scarred gravel road warning "Dead end."
That increase, she says, comes in part from employees being asked to pick up a larger percentage of their health-care costs. Many can't afford to.
We are not a global conglomerate, so everyone here knows one another. Everyone is dedicated to producing the highest quality, best-tasting ice cream for our customers.
Khut said he met with the mayor and chief at City Hall on Thursday, and with other members of the Cambodian-Laotian community. “The police need our help, and we need the police’s help,’’ Khut said.
The report said the Special Operations troops in the bin Laden raid were trained to search the home afterward for thumb drives, printed documents and what it described as "pocket litter" that might produce leads to other terrorists. "The end of the raid in Abbottabad was the beginning of a massive analytical effort," it said.
Emory’s MARBL received a grant to preserve and digitize the African-American scrapbooks in its collection and set a best practices standard that others can follow.
Between the $10 cover charge and the scores of dollar bills given to the performers, the show raised close to $1,230, said Joey Sorenson, the show director and former president of the campus club. The money will be used for a variety of club functions.
"That's my goal," she said. "To one day have an old-fashioned type picnic with fireworks over the lake."
His sledgehammer point: “Well, pal, if you’re healthy and 35 and you don’t buy insurance and you get hit by a bus and you need $10,000 in medical care and you can’t and don’t pay for it, that harms me, because I’m an insured taxpayer and I’m helping to pick up your tab.”
With such need in mind, Fang decided to devise a way for surfers to tap hours of down time squandered drinking beer, playing cards and snoozing in hammocks and instead participating in building infrastructure for coastal communities that are - or are fast becoming - popular surf destinations.
Reasons for pessimism: Minus NFL-bound center Alex Linnenkohl, who had a team-leading 38 career starts, this is the basically the same group that under-performed badly in 2010. OSU was 9th in the Pac-10 and 97th nationally in rushing last season (119.58) despite having tailback Jacquizz Rodgers. Also, OSU ranked 9th in the conference and 107th nationally in sacks allowed (35 in 12 games). Major improvement is needed, or the Beavers are in trouble. It wasn't uncommon to see Katz on his back, or to see Quizz pleading with his linemen for better blocking.
On the day the big guy gave his exit interview with the team, Oden told me, "It's not their move, it's my move. Everyone says it's their move. I think it's my move."
"In accordance with the settlement agreement between the Cleveland Clinic and the Cities of Cleveland and East Cleveland, we have been engaged in what we believed to have been good faith negotiations regarding the ramifications of the closing of a level two trauma center at Huron Hospital. At no time did the Cleveland Clinic disclose their intent to close the entire hospital. In fact, when asked directly about the future of Huron Hospital, Clinic Officials stated that there was no intention to close the emergency room, let alone the entire facility.
Prof. Kennedy's other innovation was the Boston Ceasefire program. In 1996, violent youth gangs engaged in drug dealing and other crimes were brought in by the authorities and given a simple message: "If anyone in your gang shoots somebody, we will come down on every member of the gang for all of his illegal activity." Suddenly gang members had a strong reason to enforce nonviolence on one another, and pressure from peers turned out to be more effective than pressure from police officers. Youth homicides dropped from two a month before the program started to none in the following two years.

If you're not an inhabitant, you are subject to rules and regulations - and if you work, moral integrity and honesty by your bosses. If you play professional athletics or coach or manage them, all that matters are wins and losses. You can be your world's biggest jerk, lie and cheat, deceive your employer, and sooner or later you're going to be back at work.
"If a session gets moved, it has to be replaced," Nutter says. "This is an appointment like any other, and I have to keep that appointment."
One of the launches propels riders toward the straight-up tower — no lift hill necessary. The tower is an interesting, top-heavy-looking contraption, sort of Seattle Space Needle meets Tinkertoys. Ride vehicles do a leisurely figure-8 maneuver, giving passengers a view of greater Tampa.
Gordon says he's long past looking at independently operated charter schools as competition, so long as they provide children with a quality education. He says he is more interested in highlighting the successful charters and trying to crack down on ones that fail.
Meeting up to 14 hours a day, they had three weeks to reach the finish line. Sometimes, in the real business world, they'd have one day; sometimes 1 1/2 years. The students' experience culminates at 5 p.m. today on the first floor of the UO's Turnbull Portland Center at 70 N.W. Couch St. with a display of the two dozen students' work. Designers from area footwear companies, many of whom are Edwards' long-time colleagues, are expected to attend and inspect the designs.
Why wasn't he arrested on July 20? Explanations from the Cleveland police fall short.
If you weren’t alive or didn’t have a computer in the 90s, “Leisure Suit Larry” was a hapless cartoon loser who was on a never ending quest to get laid. Under the skeevy surface, the “Larry” games were very well-crafted graphic adventure titles that happened to draw horny teens and snickering nerds in with loads of sexual innuendo (if you couldn’t tell by the title of the project). Leisure suits haven’t been around for forty years now, but the aptly named Replay Games is trying to breath some life into the lovable pervert.
Christie said earlier this week that surveillance undertaken without probable cause is not inherently wrong and must be considered on a case-by-case basis. He said those who battle terrorism are often confronted with many difficult and complicated decisions.
"It's a perk that should not exist," he said. Nash said the benefit has existed for years, but has become more objectionable in a time when the toll is up to $4 for cars heading from New Jersey to Philadelphia.
Ford's sales dropped 11 percent over last August but that had been widely expected. Last August saw strong sales thanks to the government's Cash for Clunkers program, which gave buyers up to $4,500 in cash to buy a more fuel efficient vehicle.
Stopa had not been previously charged in the case but instead pleaded guilty to a direct accusation, after waiving her right to an indictment by having a grand jury first hear the case.
Grade (1-5): - 2.9 A low grade, considering OSU returned four regulars, but until this re-vamped unit redeems itself for last year it seems high enough. Did OSU improve itself here, with players swapping positions, or was it simply re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titantic?
In Painswick, we stayed at Byfield House, part of which dates to the Tudor era. The owners rent several rooms in their spectacular home, in part to support the upkeep of the historic property and in part because they enjoy getting to know the people who pass through.
The faltering public support highlights another concern: the U.S. midterm elections next year. Democratic lawmakers fear they may become targets of Republican political attacks over the administration's handling of the war.
"We couldn't hear that much," Blues forward David Perron said. "But whenever the coach calls a timeout, you know exactly what he's calling it for. It's a wakeup call."
The gritty Martian soil eventually took its toll, though. One of Spirit's six wheels seized up in 2006. It limped gamely on, though, until a sandy patch held it fast at an angle that kept its solar panels from catching sunlight.
And voila! The zipper had arrived.
Hey, Doug: You've sized it up fairly well. Just about every year, though, I enter the meeting room with expectations and then leave it surprised by the discussions and results. It's truly a fascinating experience.
Singer-songwriter Kim Manning (P-Funk, the String Cheese Incident) recently came back to Sturgeon Bay for 10 days to record in the motel studio. "She also did a house concert," melaniejane said. "Which was really cool, this P-Funk roller skate girl. She assembled a band of local musicians, and it was great fun. She said this was a place she could reset and re-inspire. She started cranking out songs like crazy. A lot of people say that."
After scoring, Sneijder sprinted around the field, tapping the front of his head, then ran to a TV camera and tapped the lens. He was in the middle of all the postgame celebrating, too, as his teammates swarmed him when the final whistle blew.

Christmas season is one of my favorite times to visit San Francisco. Instead of staying near shopper-choaked Union Square, we booked a three-bedroom unit that came complete with a balcony to the factory's roof underneath the clock tower. The full kitchen and dining room were a meeting place for family and friends to play house in the factory.
He recently moved into a leased unit at Heritage Place Condominiums, which was built about 10 years ago and is regarded as the pioneer residential development in downtown Vancouver's renaissance around Esther Short Park.

"At this point, I remember only one line: `We'll eat you up — we love you so!' The funny thing is that, in my mind, the wild things aren't saying it. My mom is," McLeod said. "I vividly recall my mom reading that line aloud, adopting her best husky monster howl."

A: It's extraordinary. The improv is absolutely extraordinary. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's the most liberating thing I've ever done.
The Environmental Protection Agency has gotten completely out of control. It has dictated against every source of power this country has that would create enough jobs and energy to help cure our economic problems. The United States could become the power it used to be if it were allowed to drill for oil, mine for coal and produce natural gas without the constraining rules the EPA has created to block production.
This is a generally happy week around South Orange Avenue — even though the basketball team can’t hit a damn 3-pointer if its life depended on it, which, in fact, it probably did.

What's more, academics say, this kind of activity -- if not the acrimony -- is healthy.
Anderson earned $13,000 his first season as Gophers baseball coach in 1982, the job considered part-time despite the program having won three national titles. After threatening to resign, he became a full-time coach in 1986 at a salary of $25,000, which adjusting for inflation would be worth $52,525 in 2012.
Some of the guitar-makers arrive at work before dawn, and most were gone by the start of our 3 p.m. tour. To see the factory at its busiest, plan to visit before 1:30 p.m. In all, 76 people work at the Gibson factory, one of three (the others are in Nashville and Bozeman, Mont.) and the only one to offer tours. Tompkins said that the Memphis factory turns out 50 guitars a day, all made to order for individuals or retailers. "Every now and then you can pick out a really odd one, and you know it's probably for a (well-known) musician," she said.

He stressed that the 25-man roster would have been set sooner had he not wanted to wait to see how the duel between Cruz and Anderson played out for backup catcher. He met with Anderson and told the lefthanded-hitting catcher that he's proven he belongs in the majors. There is just no room for him at the moment.
