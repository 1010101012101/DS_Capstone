We have over-realized these days that it's so much easier to download our music, that we excuse the poor quality of the recording and lack of artwork and buy into our laziness.

others helped secure $3.3 million in federal funds for the long-planned northward extension of Highway 141 in St. Louis County. Mr. Akin's family owns nine acres of property near the highway. However, it seems far-fetched, at best, to suggest that's why he helped get the money.
The legal concepts are tinged with shades of gray. Borough attorney Kevin Riordan said the town is on firm footing based on a 1980s case in Middlesex County that allowed similar individual invocations. ACLU attorney Frank Corrado said any policy that allows for sectarian prayer violates the Constitution.
The president has wrung little reform from Wall Street and the banking industry, even though their reckless and sometimes immoral behavior contributed greatly to the 2008 crisis, and earned them a generous taxpayer-funded bailout nonetheless. Mr. Obama never succeeded in pressuring the banking industry to carry out widespread mortgage adjustment for millions of homeowners slipping into foreclosures, foreclosures that ensured the real estate market has sunk ever lower — and the whole economy with it.

The 2010 season was one for the ages for the senior from Mountain View High School in Bend. He began the year by breaking the world record in the heptathlon at the NCAA Indoor Championships, scoring 6,499 points. He set five event personal records to better Dan O'Brien's 1993 world record of 6,476 points.

The details: We'll start by noting that these colossal power figures were even more colossaly-er on the model we tested because it had the $6,550 AMG Performance Package. This option group says "We laugh at your adorable 518 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque, but we're really in the mood for 550 horses and 560 torques." (The added power comes from increasing the turbo's boost). The package also raises the ML63's top speed to 174 mph and adds red brake calipers; a unique steering wheel; and a carbon fiber engine cover.

The back story: Blur isn't a gay club — just gay friendly. But when it opened in the place of gay club 1470 West four years ago, the owners (who also operate neighboring Kelly's and the Chic-a-Boom Room) decided to keep the door-busting Friday night drag show tradition in tact. It hasn't slowed.

Season recap: The Sand Devils had finished runner-up four of the previous five years, but a season-ending injury to 6-foot-3 center Jessica Anderson after the first game threatened Page's chances to get back to the finals, let alone finally nab that elusive title. But this group's talent was multifaceted. The Sand Devils limited their opponents to an average of 34 points per game, while their offense racked up 60 or more points eight times. That turned out to be a winning formula for Page as it went 31-2 en route to capturing the Division III championship.

• Game 14 Recap: Portland Trail Blazers 89, Atlanta Hawks 92 -- Blazersedge: The Blazers play their best game of the road trip but can't string together enough consistent offense and commit just a few too many defensive lapses to come out ahead. The Hawks weren't clearly better, just clearly more dependable while playing a similar style to the Blazers. The Hawks can thank their two stars and their bench defense for the win.
The money a fan pays to park at Dodger Stadium will be collected by the new owners, but neither McCourt nor Guggenheim has explained how the parties will divide the revenue the team generates from the parking lots.
Example: Romney's new economic plan relies heavily on the assumption that big tax cuts will jump-start the economy -- and thus boost tax revenue and thereby erase the nation's debt and deficit woes. That sounds an awful lot like what didn't work very well for President George W. Bush.
PG&E's admission of negligent liability settles the issue of whether the company should compensate victims and families for their actual damages, which alone could run into the millions of dollars. Punitive damages are capped at roughly 10 times actual damages.

For me, pizza heaven only lasted the few short years that Shakey's Pizza Parlor existed at Great Northern shopping center in North Olmsted. This was the mid- to late- '60s. There was no better pizza (we always got pepperoni), and the place had a ton of atmosphere. You entered the dining room past a long glassed-in kitchen, where the pizza boys were often tossing the dough high in the air. On weekend nights, there was a piano player and sometimes a banjo player who played Dixieland and took requests from the crowd. Shakey's served pop in thick glass mugs. It was the perfect family dinner. --Pizzaboy Northeast

Benazepril is another medication used in some cats with chronic kidney disease. This drug helps open blood vessels and can decrease blood pressure and promote blood flow through the kidneys. Antacids, appetite stimulants and antibiotics can also be used with chronic kidney disease patients when warranted. Several supplements and probiotics are designed to help keep the kidneys functioning as well as possible. Since cats are often challenging to medicate, veterinarians need to choose which treatments provide the most benefit, are the least stressful to administer, and maintain the best quality of life for owner and cat.
In 1926, Carter G. Woodson, through his organization, the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (later renamed the Association for the Study of African American Life and History), founded and promoted Negro History Week. He selected February because Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass' birthdays fell during this month. His desire was for Americans to recognize and celebrate the achievements and accomplishments of black people. The response was overwhelming, as black schools, black churches and black and white community leaders around the country rallied behind this call and pushed Negro History Week to the forefront.
In 1963, the Ronettes applied that sound to holiday music on "A Christmas Gift for You." The album is now a classic, and a model for contemporary artists making Christmas music.

"The thing that’s unique about my business is my client base is almost everybody," said Steven DiMartino, 32.

Everyone is affected by the weather, and they want to know what it means for them."
Tannenbaum denied that tonight, but he had to send an additional $2.5 million to the Broncos to complete the deal. This was another telling glimpse inside the organization, one that explains a lot about this franchise and its 43-year (and counting) Super Bowl drought, one that makes Tannenbaum look like he didn’t understand the fundamentals of his job.

He has granted bail reductions in a handful of those cases - but only after 30 to 45 days and if the defendant showed a change of mind-set, strong family support and a commitment to drop ties with unsavory associates.
Then there is Beinart's hysteria-fueled treatment of the Israeli political scene. His fundamental contention is that the growth of Jewish communities in the territories has effectively faded the Green Line to the point of near-invisibility. This is the sheerest bunk. The reason Ariel Sharon was reluctant to build the security barrier is that he understood it meant drawing a de facto border between Israel and the territories. But he built it anyway, just as he also decided to get Israel out of Gaza. Since then, Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted the principle of a Palestinian state. Beinart offers a lengthy explanation for why Bibi's June 2009 Bar-Ilan speech was no more than a tactic of diplomatic delay, and maybe it was. But the fact is that Mr. Revisionist publicly accepted the idea of a Palestinian state—and paid no political price for it with his right-wing base.
Wolf, 28, of Roseville, who for years has arranged his schedule around Kings games, promised he won't be going to Power Balance Pavilion for a while  and maybe ever  echoing the angst and anger of fans across the region reeling from Friday's news that the proposed new arena deal was all but squashed by the Maloofs, the Kings' owners.

There's more to the Gruve than just the weensy wearable widget. It comes with a USB cable to connect it to your computer (Apple or PC), where you can store your daily calories-burned data, track your seven-day average and maybe get inspired to best your "best day ever."

Home sales vary by season, so sales in one month are best compared with the same month a year earlier. Last year's comparisons were skewed by the federal first-time homebuyer program that gave subsidies of up to $8,000 to buyers. The program expired in July of last year, and it probably prompted some people to buy early in 2010 instead of later.
To be fair, the Chicago Bulls' Derrick Rose, soccer's David Beckham and future No. 2 NFL Draft Pick Robert Griffin III have been or, in Griffin's case, will be featured prominently in Adidas marketing campaigns. Rose, Beckham and Argentine soccer player Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona are featured along with Perry in the Seduction campaign.

As my colleague Jeff Zrebiec reported this weekend from the 2012 NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh pretty much shot down the notion that the team would pursue one of the top unrestricted free agents on the market next month and general manager Ozzie Newsome said the Ravens aren’t going to attempt to sign Mike Wallace, a restricted free agent, away from the rival Pittsburgh Steelers.

Tebow, though, remains undaunted and consistent, ignoring the rants about him online and elsewhere.

Known as the DREAM ACT, the legislation that would allow children brought into the country illegally to attend and pay in-state tuition at public universities, was reintroduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in March.

Rooms filled with pale roses greeted nearly 400 stylishly clad guests at the annual Miracles Happen benefit fundraiser for the Diana Hyland Miracle Fund at Shaker Heights Country Club on Nov. 5. Partygoers enjoyed an oh-so-chic silent auction over cocktails before a dinner prepared by celebrity chef Zachary Bruell and the country club's executive chef, Matt Gambatese.

Peavy, Dunn and Rios - three-fourths of the White Sox' subpar group of 2011 that's being counted on to bounce back and have the 2012 team playing meaningful games in September - kept their fast-track starts going in the Sox' 4-0 victory over the Oakland A's on Monday night.
"Joevan was pretty passionate in that he wanted to play,'' Altman said. "He's given so much to our team this year, he wanted to suit it up, so that made the decision pretty easy.''

August 18, 1991. My daughter Aimee's first birthday. I grew up in Kalamazoo, but at the time I lived in Connecticut. My wife Mary and I were back in Michigan sharing Aimee with her grandparents and family and friends for her first birthday. And Ernie Harwell was in his first final year of retirement. I wanted to see him, and equally importantly, I wanted to see if he would do a Tiger Birthday Greeting for my first-born child.
"I saw him in pain. He's not one of those guys that's going to pretend or do that if he is not hurting," Ginobili said. "It's bad, but hopefully it's just a couple of games and he'll be back soon."
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau says forward Joakim Noah is doubtful for Game 4 on Sunday against the 76ers because of a sprained ankle.
Problem was the gangs worked for Tammany. The Democratic machine used them as shtarkers (sluggers), enforcing discipline at the polls and intimidating the opposition. Gang leaders like Monk Eastman were even employed as informal “sheriffs,” keeping their turf under Tammany control.
found no link to electronic problems, an issue raised by safety groups as a potential cause of the vehicle problems. A separate investigation by the Transportation Department and NASA has not uncovered any electronic problems, but the probe is expected to continue into 2011.
Industry observers say labor peace is needed for a quick launch of the United-Continental merger, delivering the cost-savings and efficiencies promised by airline executives who struck the Oct. 1 deal.
“Any win in the playoffs is a great win. If you go wire to wire with it, if you come from behind, if you do it in overtime, it’s about winning. It doesn’t really matter how it was done. Like I said, I’m happy to see the response from our team after the first period and in the last 45 minutes. It was a strong effort from that point out.”
“It’s definitely a conversation starter,” Brouwer said.
In 1962, we lived in Miami. I was in third grade, my sister in fourth. The Cuban missile crisis came to us in the form of twice-daily duck-and-cover drills, out in the hallway, and in the drone of low-flying jets. I don't remember my parents talking about it.
A nearby taxi driver who saw what was happening shouted if he should call police, Turner said. When Turner said yes and he looked to see if the man might have a gun, the man stood up and struck him in the head with his cane, Turner said.
Hey, Doug: The only blame in this Ohio State mess belongs with the NCAA rules that were made in the early days and don't fit into today's world. It's a shame Ohio State is paying the price for an incompetent NCAA rules committee. -- Dennis Danes, Ravenna
Talk about altitude overblown? Not if you ask Vanderbilt players.
Obama began his remarks by simply saying: "Obviously, yesterday we made some news." That drew the most enthusiastic applause of the evening.
Since then, Brown's auto repair business failed and the couple has filed for bankruptcy, making Brown rather more like the very people the law says it looks out for -- the ones who would be forced into bankruptcy because of medical bills.
Stars often complained about the straitjacket of being typecast. But they were looked after. Studio publicity departments were elaborate machines for projecting the good news and killing the bad. Some say the nature of archetypes became oppressive. Others contend that from 1920 to 1950, America made its greatest films, and enjoyed the absolute loyalty of the audience. There is no going back, but everyone points to the conditions of a hit TV show as being the closest to the model of the studio system. And as on "The Sopranos," say, surely the steady company of a group of writers and directors and a family of actors has been good for these series.
Other students wear "I (heart) boobies" rubber bracelets in support of breast-cancer awareness. The items are sold by the Keep A Breast Foundation, a non-profit organization, who said on their website their mission is to "help eradicate breast cancer by exposing young people to methods of prevention, early detection and support."
Her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, will be the commander of Endeavour when it launches in April, and his identical twin brother Scott is the current leader of the International Space Station crew. Mark Kelly has been training for the mission and said earlier he hoped his wife would be able to see him off. But despite her seemingly steady improvements -- the latest include singing with her husband and chanting Hebrew healing prayers -- doctors have been cautious.

As quarterback Vinny Testaverde returned from the Pound and was about to exit into the tunnel, he stood frozen in time, with his fists raised, his head held high and his eyes misting over while the crowd in front of him roared. He had accomplished his goal of giving the fans one last victory in front of the Cleveland fans, a 26-10 rout of the Bengals that snapped a six-game losing streak.
Maldonado's decisive vote to break the budget impasse last year in exchange for support for a ballot measure to create open primaries - which voters approved - cemented his reputation as a moderate while alienating some in his own party. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed the then-state senator as lieutenant governor when Democrat John Garamendi was elected to Congress, but Maldonado has held the post for only about six months.
Suthers said there has been an increase in the number of dispensaries and patients since federal regulations eased earlier this year.
After doing some homework, Jungling and Turpeinen decided to swap out 21 wood windows for thermally efficient vinyl ones in March. The job cost a little more than $14,000, including installation, some extra trim work and two storm doors. The $1,500 credit will come next year at tax-filing time. They're also expecting Energy Trust incentives that their window installer, All Season Windows, estimates at about $540.
The complaint describes those examples as “insufficient and unfair as it contains examples which are not prohibited by the measure and fails to list examples of actions the measure would actually prohibit.”
The Ravens are known for their great drafts, so of course their first overall pick, Alabama linebacker/defensive end Courtney Upshaw (No. 35), is going to be a beast. Never mind that he slid because he is a 'tweener; he is going to be mentored by Ray Lewis, which means he will be the next Ray Lewis. Suddenly, Iowa State offensive tackle Kelechi Osemele (No. 60) is a high-value pick.
Finally, two weeks ago — on a holiday week when no one was paying attention — the state dropped the last remaining charge against Cortes.
Or maybe he's bought some futures in the cinnamon market with his allowance, and now he's acting as a shill to protect his investment. Unlikely, yes. But a mother can hope, can't she?

Whatever: Ashley tells boyfriend Derek that it's tough being home because her mother won't drop the fact that Ashley attacked Danielle. "At first I was like yeah, you know, I learned my lesson, blah blah blah, I was handling it well, but then she just keeps on bringing it up over and over again." Ah, to be 19 and lack any trace of self-awareness. In voiceover, Caroline says that Ashley was wrong, but she was doing it to protect her mother. Except her mother did not need protecting, of course. Ashley says Danielle has it out for her and wonders who she slept with to pay for her brand-new hair extensions. Derek tells her he's tired of talking about her, and that he hopes that Ashley got it out of her system. And Ashley says -- all together now -- whatever.

In 2012, this kind of diversity has become the default. When you ask Los Angeles chefs about their favorite restaurants today, they are far more likely to mention Jitlada, Guelaguetza and Din Tai Fung than they are Spago or Mélisse, and they tend to be at least as excited about yuzu zest and kalamansi lime as they are about lobster and truffles. At least as many food people this year have been talking about the move of Mexicali Taco & Co. from a truck to an Angeleno Heights storefront as have been talking about Wolfgang Puck's splendid new restaurant at Hotel Bel-Air.

Owning a lifetime car is a different mindset. Most drivers change rides with age and maturity. In contrast, my 911 has evolved with its owner. When I was 33 years old, the two of us blazed from Los Angeles to San Francisco in a four- hour midnight run. Today, the car obliges a 58-year-old who prefers smooth, seamless shifts instead of sublime, screaming corners.
"Tripp Norton got a significant promotion to director of baseball administration," Duquette said. "Tripp is a good veteran baseball man and we are glad to have him."
Nevertheless, Chris Gardocki, the first expansion-era punter, never had one blocked. Bay Village's Dave Zastudil and last year's punter Brad Maynard often bottled opponents up inside their 20-yard lines. Rambling Reggie Hodges ran for a 68-yard gain on fourth down against New Orleans in 2010. It was the longest run ever by an NFL punter and, sigh, the longest of the season by any Brown. None of those guys made the Pro Bowl, though.
"Ideally, my originals have strong roots in the blues but also have something unexpected, like a chord change or voicing that takes it on a jag to left field, but not so far that you get uneasy," Cobb said. "Also from growing up with the Beatles, I love bridges. That is to say, most straight ahead blues is a 12 bar pattern that stays the same through the whole song. Lennon and McCartney and their disciples tend to have an 'A' section and a bridge called a 'B' section that takes you somewhere else for a bit. Some of their songs even have a 'C' section which is even cooler. I would never hold myself up to that skill level but those are my influences!"
"He was as determined as he could be," Backes said of Oshie, who had two assists. "He fights off a few checks. Then he takes it to the net and draws a few more guys to him. I had the easy part. Tons of kudos to him; he plays hard every night."

In addition to stretching valuable resources to train staff, the law has so many bureaucratic nuances that lawsuits are all but assured. Taxpayers and school districts will have to bear these costs as well, and with a multi-million-dollar settlement already granted in a North Jersey school district, the stage is set for a lot of litigation at a high cost to everyone involved.
Segal said she did not know Thursday whether she would issue a formal written opinion on the matter -- it has been limited to oral advice.
For the most part, Marecelita's plays it safe with hearty Tex-Mex choices and standard Mexican fare such as tacos, enchiladas and burritos. There's nothing new or adventurous here -- not that there's anything wrong with that. For little diners and their tired parents in the Hudson area, it's a fiesta in the making.
As a result, Colorado will play tonight, followed by a doubleheader Wednesday, preserving Thursday's off day. The first game is scheduled for 10:35 a.m., with the second game starting 30 minutes after completion of the first game. The Rockies will start Jamie Moyer tonight opposite of Pittsburgh's Kevin Correia — Moyer would continue to make history with every win — followed by Juan Nicasio in Game 1 on Wednesday and Jhoulys Chacin in the series finale. Nicasio showed better command in his last outing after fixing a glitch in his leg kick.

Because the competition takes place in the bracing air of the Cold War, Anatoly and Freddie are hardly alone. Their respective governments have a role in the outcome. Stephen Day brings commanding stature and a resonant baritone to handler Alexander Molokov. American Walter de Courcey (Colin Alexander) appears less savvy and more commerce-driven.

From its Reservoir Control Center in suburban Omaha, corps officials made calculations several weeks ago that are worrying people now at both ends of the river.

To finish: Bring wings to room temperature. Meanwhile, combine pearl onions, vinegar and 1/2 cup water in a very small non-aluminum pot; the liquid (1 part vinegar to 4 parts water, if more is needed) should amply cover the onions. Bring to a boil and cook about 45 seconds, just to loosen skins. Remove onions, trim root ends, peel and set aside. This can be done ahead.

Wynne helped popularize the concept of paying one admission fee, while other parks at the time charged visitors to go on individual rides. And he created a corporate culture where no employee - from ride operators to the CEO - could walk past a piece of trash and not pick it up and throw it away. It's an ethos that still exists today; whenever Roemer is out in the park, he carries a broom and pan with him, sweeping up any litter he sees.
Unfortunately for Cooper, more than 18,000 fans and a regional television audience witnessed one of his worst days as a professional soccer player. The disastrous day only added to the pressure on a high-profile forward who hasn't scored a goal in more than a month.

On Saturday, they held a fundraiser called Celebracion Gastronomica that featured foods from Guatemala, Colombia, Puerto Rico and Mexico. All proceeds will be used to aid the laid-off workers.
The government has no money of its own. The only way it gets money is by confiscating it from others. In doing so, government diminishes the ability of individuals and companies to create jobs. Payroll taxes hinder the creation of jobs. Excessive business regulation and meddlesome permitting hinder the creation of jobs, no matter how well-meaning they may seem. Compulsory insurance and health care mandates — including the future threat thereof — hinder the creation of jobs.

Keeping the illegal-immigration issue burning might help some Republican candidates who need a fired-up conservative base, campaign strategists in both parties said Thursday. And the federal ruling might let Republicans campaign for tougher immigration enforcement without embarrassing scenes of police officers demanding documents from U.S. citizens of Latino descent, a widely predicted fallout of Arizona's pending law.
"I think these kids come in so well prepared when they are freshmen, we just have to speed up their game," Cook said. "We just have to get them bigger and stronger. As far as knowing skills, they know 'em."

In the meantime, the federation sponsored three "Shabbat in the Park" events in eastside parks this summer, with rabbis from two local congregations leading the Friday evening sundown services and taking turns handing out lollipops to kids in the crowd. Hundreds of Jews came to picnic and celebrate, Blattner said. The events included klezmer music, prayers, challah bread and candle-lighting to uphold tradition, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream afterwards to break the mold.
Hazell's name was among six to 10 that first-year athletic director Joel Nielsen kept on a ready list of head coaching candidates. Hazell's winning legacy, polished at Army, Rutgers, West Virginia and Ohio State, put him on Kent's radar. His OSU resume, where he coached future NFL receivers Santonio Holmes, Ted Ginn Jr., Anthony Gonzalez, Brian Hartline and the Browns' Brian Robiskie, spoke for itself. Tressel promoted him to assistant head coach within a year.

Harbaugh mentioned another of James' skills: "The unstoppable nature of him at the goal line. ... You could not stop that team inside the 5-yard line."
Stadium opponents have decried the idea of giving hundreds of millions of public dollars to a billionaire for what they dub "Zygi World," a reference to the anticipated hotels, stores and other developments surrounding a new stadium.

Ironically, there are no dolls in this dollhouse—Lutyens preferred the environment to be the star. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling wrote original works for the library, Rolls-Royce and Daimler built limousines for the garage, and Alfred Dunhill rolled cigarettes containing the king's blend of tobacco. Some might dismiss the dollhouse as a curiosity rather than serious art, but the charm and resonance of this object are not so easy to forget. Go to Windsor Castle, home now to Mary's granddaughter Queen Elizabeth, and see for yourself. For all the da Vincis, Rembrandts and Rubenses on display, when you get home that night, you just might find yourself thinking about that grandfather clock, and whether it works or not. The lawn mower does.

Rondo bumped Davis with 41 seconds left in the Celtics’ Game 1 loss to the Hawks Sunday after being assessed a technical foul for arguing a call.

Aviation officials struggled to understand why, beginning in the 1990s, commuter and large transport jet pilots were reporting engine flameouts or partial loss of power. There have been no crashes to date attributed to engine icing. Pilots usually are able to restart or regain full engine power after dropping to lower, warmer altitudes, although the pilot of a small business jet had to make an emergency "dead-stick" landing at the Jacksonville, Fla., airport in November 2005 when neither stalled engine would re-light.

From Pope Leo XIII to Benedict XVI, and especially in the social writings of John Paul II, the rights of workers have been explained and defended. Based on the Gospel principle of the common good and the biblical teaching of care for the poor and the sick, the Catholic Church developed a coherent and detailed response to modern industrial society. The revised Catholic Catechism (Vatican, 1994) states that profit as an exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is morally unacceptable; that there is a basic right to a just wage and recourse to strikes; and the importance of unions in achieving workers’ rights as well as the collective bargaining process.

Staying open until sunrise, it was a place where people could stop in after the bars closed and drink coffee and tea while most people were sound asleep — hence the name. Now Insomniacs is primarily a bar, serving more beer and wine than coffee, and it's open only until 2 a.m., as the law dictates. Of course, coffee is still on the menu: $2 a cup, or $5 for all you can drink.

A duck confit has perfect crispness, while a bit of lobster on the plate makes for a contrast of textures while enhancing the richness of the dish; a half a grilled peach is a sweet touch.
