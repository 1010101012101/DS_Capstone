In the most shocking of surprises, the populist wine geeks didn't take the gold this year. A wine with huge integrity made it to the top, and what was even more shocking, it was a red Zinfandel. I specify "red" because there's this stuff called "white" Zinfandel, which is a pink wine made with the red grape called Zinfandel. Anyway, in the past 10 years, the folks who made the red Zinfandel have been committing all of the greatest sins of winemaking. The wines have been over extracted, overripe, over alcohol, until I was over IT! This wine that took first place is balanced and refined without giving up the brash and brawny character that we originally loved about Zinfandel, the truly American grape.
It's a daunting task. The Northwest and Middle branches of the Patapsco River, which form Baltimore's harbor, are littered with trash, unfit to swim in and plagued by algae blooms and fish kills.

The bottom is a toxic wasteland that makes many fish caught in the harbor unsafe to eat.

And, by the way, in the same article he makes a case that he's a pastor and not a historian or theologian. Well, he's dabbling awfully deeply into history and theology, and, unfortunately, people take what he says at face value. Theology is the tool of our pastoral craft. Of course, we are translators of that theology, but we must be theologians in some form. Theology also is closely related to history since theology has been formed within historical contexts.

The program budget for the Bureau of Environmental Services next year is about $325 million, including $114 million to finish the eastside Big Pipe project.

But Green foresaw too many important conversations. And Wood was happy to listen, whether eating out together or on the court during games or during practice or chilling in their living room or in the front room of the locker room. They talked about basketball and life and how few thought either would be in the position they are in -- Green as everyone's All-America and Wood as a one-time nomadic gunner who can't wait to get in an opponent's face.

After international fares slumped in the summer of 2009, airlines battled back. They kept their route networks trim, even after demand crept up, and forged competition-killing alliances, Seaney said.

For holding off on a deal, the Yankees were rewarded by Pineda, whose upside is far superior to the other options that had been available for the Yankees.

If both the regime and the opposition forces agreed to a cease-fire, there is no guarantee that Assad wouldn't stall on implementation of the political components of the plan. But countless lives might be saved. The "Friends of Syria" that met over the weekend in Istanbul rightly made their priority an end to the "atrocities committed by the regime," even as they called for "a Syrian-led political transition leading to a civil, democratic, pluralistic, independent and free state." The Western and Arab nations that have pushed for political change in Syria can continue to pursue that objective, but the urgent imperative is an end to the killing.

Teresa's husband Joe had earlier pulled his bankruptcy petition after he pleaded the Fifth Amendment when the trustee, John Sywilok, questioned him about concealing assets -- which is a federal crime. After the Star-Ledger revealed the about-face, their lawyer told People magazine in September that Teresa planned to drop her bankruptcy case as well because she is now earning enough money to pay her debts. But a consent order agreed to by Teresa and the Office of the U.S. Trustee (a division of the Justice Department) wasn't signed until Wednesday. Teresa's trial, set for Dec. 23, has been canceled.

Why can't we all just agree that we have been fleeced by the Baltimore Grand Prix and move on ("Md. warns it may seize Grand Prix firm's assets," Nov. 22)?

It's time to shop. And wouldn't it be great if you had an expert to consult for your holiday wine shopping? Hunting for a Wii or a diamond pendant is hard enough, but wine lovers have a remarkably finicky streak - trust me, I know this fact intimately well - which means you have about as much luck choosing the perfect wine as grabbing a random CD for the music lover in your life.

"The 382,000 students in Ohio who rely on federal Stafford loans to make college a reality deserve a simple yes or no answer from Josh Mandel on whether he would support Sherrod's bill to make college more affordable or vote to let their interest rates double," Brown press secretary Sadie Weiner said in an email.

We know our worth as human beings should never be measured solely by how we earn our money, but many of us play that game.

In our heads, however, where doubts churn and flaws fester, we are first and foremost what we do for a living. And we apply that same test to every adult we meet.

Gov. Jerry Brown, who refuses to address the bloated state government even as he spends more and demands more from taxpayers, argues that the state's Draconian carbon-emission cap-and-trade system, which imposes fees on businesses that produce carbon dioxide in the name of fighting global warming, will fund the train line. That amounts to yet another massive tax on businesses to fund something far less than necessary. How many more companies will head for the exits or expand their operations in states that encourage business creation rather than view private enterprise as a cash cow that can always be milked?

Melville and Hawthorne were friends for only a couple of years, from 1850, when they met, until 1852, when they stopped corresponding. As to why this was, one possible reason is Hawthorne's inability to get Melville a job with the U.S. government, which, notes the website "The Life and Works of Herman Melville," left the " Moby-Dick" author"embarrassed and chagrined."

Kin is the great secret of the Pearl District, so keep this under your hat. Award-winning Chicago chef Kevin Shikami arrived here last year, and began offering Asian fusion cuisine that reminds you why it was a craze before it became a cliche. Seared yellowfin tuna with crispy spicy tuna roll, with soy and sesame, brings East and West together on a plate, and it's a theme Shikami strikes often, combining sautéed duck breast with Chinese sausage-stuffed duck leg, or Kobe beef with foie gras with soy and wasabi. Kin sets its cuisine in a warm space of reclaimed wood and sculpted lights. Come summer, when the glass front wall opens to the street, it may be hard to keep the secret.

* There are other ways for this to happen, but I'm keeping it simple. The objective should be nothing short of winning the final two games and building confidence and a bit of momentum heading into the postseason. Two wins, and it's done, No. 1 in the West. Why should the Blues open themselves to the risk of needing Edmonton to upset Vancouver to hope for a chance to back into the No. 1 spot? Forget that. The Blues need to assert themselves by winning the final two games. And if they screw up the opportunity? Well, it's not as if it means they'll soil the bed in the playoffs. But it wouldn't be a good sign. The Blues had reasonably firm control of the No. 1 seed, then gave way to the Canucks. There is no good reason for that to happen again, not in the final 48 hours of the schedule, with so much at stake.

So no - I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. This danger will only grow if the region slides backwards, and al Qaeda can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.

Aiding Kamehameha's aggressive reputation was his possession of the war god, Kuka'ilimoku, which his uncle had bequeathed him, and four years of warfare with other Big Island chiefs after Kalani'o'pu'u died in 1782. His main rival ended up being killed in 1791 at the temple to Kuka'ilimoku that Kamehameha had ordered built the year before, in the same manner as Mo'okini Heiau. For the massive Pu'ukoholā Heiau, the stones would have to travel 25 miles by hand from Pololū to an arid site near Kawaihae. Now a national historic site that includes two other temples (including an underwater one dedicated to the shark god), Pu'ukoholā hosts an annual celebration of the unification of the islands with traditional ceremonies, games, hula and other cultural events. This year's Ho'oku'ikahi Establishment festival takes place Aug. 14-15.

Everybody in the country gauges the rest of their season off coming down here and playing you, so you're every team's Super Bowl. I told the guys it doesn't matter if you're Calvert Hall, St. Paul's, Loyola or us, when these teams come to town, this is where they base where they're at for their season. It's the standard, so you got to strap it up every time you go out there because they're going to be fighting for their lives. I think it says a lot about the conference. It's tremendous; just look at the products in college out of the conference. I've always had a great respect for the conference, and that's why I'm here.

It overwhelmingly passed the Legislature and was placed on the statewide ballot in 2010 as Proposal 2. It passed into law on its own merits and without any campaigning, with almost 70% of Wayne County voters supporting it. Yet there is still a disconnect between what the people called for and what some of their elected officials are doing.

Arizona could be next season’s Kentucky. Sean Miller has made it clear he won’t tolerate nonsense. Last year’s star recruit, point guard Josiah Turner, recently announced he is transferring. Lamont “Momo” Jones left the year before. Miller, with a lot of help from city legend Book Richardson, brought in the nation’s No. 2 class with four top-50 recruits led by center Kaleb Tarczewski (No. 9).

Fotuhi said some memory lapses are an “acceptable” part of aging. For example, Fotuhi gives a 75-year-old patient four items to remember. If the patient can remember half of the items and the other two after receiving clues, the patient likely does not have MCI. But if a patient can only remember one of the items and can’t remember the other three, even after clues are provided, that’s a red flag. Other common tests for MCI include writing a sentence and naming 8 to 10 fruits in one minute.

"I guess when you hear people like Miles Davis and Ray Charles -- we're talking the top black musicians, Ella Fitzgerald -- they don't know what bad notes are.

Natalie I think I`ve always known at the right time, in the right place, that the story would help other people and that`s what I`ve hoped for. You have to understand the culture of a university campus, especially the University of Nebraska, because they were heading for a national title. I was just as much a football fan as anyone else and it was a tough decision because a lot of people didn`t want anything to bring down the football team ... especially a sexual assault charge against one of the star players. I was out with my friends, a typical college night in a crowded place.
There's no doubt the Sox need to beef up depth in the infield. I don't think anyone is losing any sleep over the loss of Carrithers, who is 27 and had been in the Detroit organization. I did think that Martinez would make more of a favorable impression in spring training. Kenny Williams Jr., 25, is batting .212 at Double-A Birmingham in his fifth professional season, and injuries can't be used as an excuse any more.

The proposal was debated in private last Friday by the University System of Maryland's Board of Regents.

The Commerce Department's May 17 ruling, in response to allegations of dumping by the U.S. unit of a German solar panel maker, could fundamentally alter the solar landscape in the U.S. Dumping is when a company or industry sells its products below cost to capture the market.

"Probably my first playoff game when Ottawa beat us in the second round (in 2007) was most memorable for me personally. To actually get to play in a playoff game.

"[Anthony] can miss 15 shots straight and he's going to shoot the next one,'' Wade said. "He's got that Kevin Durant type of mindset.

That political clout is evident today, with city councils from Oakland to San Diego condemning the Arizona law and 50,000 people demonstrating in Los Angeles on May 1 in support of immigrants.

Those calls have become especially loud in violence-wracked corners of Latin America, such as Guatemala. During a recent summit of regional leaders in Colombia, President Barack Obama said he was open to debate on drug policies but ruled out legalization, saying it would lead to worse problems.

When he made his annual budget address to lawmakers in February, Corbett said the state expected to finish the 2011-12 fiscal year $719 million in the red.

"Putting these books on our shelves and even promoting author events is by no means an endorsement of their views or that language, but simply an endorsement of the overriding principle that people have a right to their own words and their own opinions, and so do those who choose to protest those views and those opinions," Hart wrote. "We cannot, as booksellers, make ourselves into censors of any kind, as that would be the ultimate betrayal of that principle."

"The law was passed partly in response to a lack of federal action on the issue," he continued.

This video isn’t particularly funny or interesting. I know that’s not a great sales pitch for your click, and given that only 65 people have watched it, maybe there’s a reason it remains undiscovered.

Why does this exist? I have no idea, but I think YouTube commenter “Mojito Quick” sums it up best: “Ya, dumb but I enjoy it.”

He also surpassed 300 yards passing for seven straight games and 13 times during the season, both beating league marks he already held.

In all, the study found that 8.1% of those deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan appeared to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of their return--well within the range of current estimates of 4% to 17% of recent veterans. But that figure doesn't convey big differences in disorder rates among the branches of military service: Army soldiers were almost twice as likely to show signs of post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder as Marines--even though both are widely deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and Navy personnel were about three-quarters as likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder as Army personnel.

So here we are, a month into autumn, and I'm finally coming to terms with it. Fortunately, the transition seasons, spring and autumn, are sufficiently thrilling to make one forget a so-so summer.

She didn't believe the other winners at first, thinking it was an early April Fool's joke, but they told her they were on their way over, Martino said.

Though it gives ample coverage to critics, this is not an anti-highway screed. Swift has a clear-eyed view of the interstate system's benefits (speed and safety) and drawbacks (homogeneity and ugly off-ramp development). His opening chapters make abundantly clear the pressing need for better roads in the early 20th century, and he evinces great respect for men like MacDonald and Turner, who addressed that need with careful research and engineering. Their prescription for cities was misguided, but an aroused citizenry checked its worst excesses. In fact, from start to finish "Big Roads" offers a reasonably optimistic portrait of democracy in action, with government officials striving to give the public what it wanted and to answer people's complaints when what they got wasn't quite what they expected.

In the past few years, major technology companies have become integral to interpersonal communication and information management. At the same time, many of these firms have tweaked user agreements in exactly the way Google has, helping the industry legally position itself for a mass intellectual property grab. That means whether you are using a photo-sharing site or a Web-based email account, you may have signed off on letting one of these corporations do whatever it wants with your data.

He dresses like a Victorian and speaks in an idiosyncratic English peppered with ineptly pretentious exclamations such as “Goodness of graciousness!” and “Be of silence!” He has a position with the British Native Commission, upholstered furniture and a silver tea set.
