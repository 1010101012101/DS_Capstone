What happens when we make our private moments public property? A recent survey suggests that 92 percent of American children have an online footprint by age 2. This raised a series of questions to me: To what extent do we own our children's right to privacy? How will children construct their own sense of self in a world in which one has already been constructed for them? How will this impact their own notion of personal privacy as they mature? What does it means to rely on the wisdom of crowds to influence personal family decisions?
Those cheers turned to jeers as the Rockies came undone by sloppy defense in their 7-0 loss to the San Francisco Giants.
The threshold calculus for measures such as state voter identification laws should be a simple one: Will the law at issue prevent more illegitimate persons from voting than it will prevent legitimate persons from voting?

This stoner comedy, better than their previous outing, relies on lots of inside jokes while taking great delight in mocking its 3-D format. It's probably the best 3-D comedy to date, with objects coming crazily at the camera at unexpected times. The sight gags don't work nearly as well in 2-D on DVD and Blu-ray, but they're still funny.

Tressel was in the business of winning football games. The inattention that verged on willful ignorance of Clarett's lavish lifestyle was followed by "Minimum Jim's" absurdly lenient one-game suspension of linebacker Robert Reynolds in 2003 for choking Wisconsin quarterback Jim Sorgi on the bottom of a pile of tacklers. It was a mean, nasty game on both sides of the ball, with players spitting at each other, but that is no excuse for such a dirty play nor is it justification for such a ridiculously light penalty. OSU was still in the hunt to defend its national championship then, and expediency trumped severity in punishment.

Tillman proposes cutting taxes to businesses in several ways, including a tax break for corporations that rent existing facilities and hire at least five to ten workers from the neighborhood.
Hey, Tony: I always try to look at contract negotiations from both sides. I understand Peyton Hillis is "only" making $600K but he has had one big season thus far. Though I agree a raise and extension is due (and am hoping one is reached), don't you feel Hillis's bellyaching and whining to the media is growing a bit old? -- Joshua Jones, Fullerton, Calif.
The suspension is Artest's third career ban of at least seven games.

The pace of Wilkinson's transition to his new position already has accelerated. His scouting trip to Ghana last week caused him to missed Thursday's home loss against Montreal and the team's game at Baltimore Saturday.

The state allows hunting of a certain number of black bears in the fall, but hunters are required to have licenses and register their kills with the state. California prohibits anyone from buying or selling bear parts, even if they are imported from other areas. Peddling bear parts is illegal in 34 states, including California, but they are highly prized in Asian markets. The gallbladder is "by far" the most often stolen part of a bear because it is very popular in traditional Chinese medicine as an aphrodisiac or cure for a variety of ills, said Lt. Kathy Ponting, who leads the Fish and Game unit that investigates illegal commercialization of wildlife.

He liked to grab a small cafe mocha and a newspaper in the morning at the Wild Horse Creek gift shop. He had a routine, one that gift shop supervisor Emily Major quickly learned. All he had to do was ask, "Can I get one of those, Emily?" She knew what he meant. When she said, "Have a good day," he sometimes responded, "I don't care if I have a good day. I want a good night."

The Grizzlies have some serious issues in the post, with Darrell Arthur out for the season with a torn Achilles' tendon and Zach Randolph out for a game or two with a knee bruise.

On Wednesday night, Florida lost one of the state's true GOP patriarchs: attorney Thom Rumberger, a respected lawyer who fought for everything from the Everglades to Fair Districts. Rumberger believed in hard-fought political battles — but not in stacking the deck by gerrymandering districts beforehand. He will be missed.

The Buckeyes also showed that in the loss to Nebraska two weeks ago, running 41 times for 243 yards while completing just six of 18 passes for 108 yards. Boren said in that game he played 55 snaps, a huge number for a fullback. But Boren is as consistently good at his job as any Ohio State player, and the Buckeyes are better when he's on the field. More running means more Boren, and that's a good thing, too.

Set your seedlings on the prepared soil, and test your arrangements before settling them in. Keep seedlings together where you can keep them moist and wait for an overcast day to plant. New roots are so near the surface, they dry out quickly in the harsh sun. A run of drizzly days will give your seedlings a chance to dig their roots into the ground. If you must plant in the sunshine, watch that the young plants don't dry out.

His 16-year-old daughter, Katie, greeted him at the finish line, where she was handing out water as a race volunteer.

Damning with faint praise? Sure, why not? It's better than no praise at all and certainly could have applied to a movie like this. But a willing cast, led by Mark Wahlberg as the bad guy gone straight who has to pull off one ... more ... job, and abetted considerably by Giovanni Ribisi as a dependably unhinged lunatic, makes the film a lot better than it could have been.

None of these new ideas is obviously right, of course, and none of them has won the debate yet. There are still plenty of supporters for Gen. David H. Petraeus' counterinsurgency strategy, which calls for training thousands of Afghan troops and holding off the Taliban until they are ready to take over -- although, in the face of setbacks, some counterinsurgency boosters have sounded distinctly tepid recently about the chances of success.

The regional cuisine of Tabasco state, known for its continued use of traditional pre-Hispanic ingredients and recipes, makes liberal use of freshwater fish and seafood. But it's also one of Mexico's biggest cattle producers and grows sugar cane, cacao, coffee, corn, rice, peppers, bananas, coconuts, pineapple, watermelon and a variety of exotic fruit. All these, in addition to Maya herbs and spices more often associated with the Yucatán, flavor Tabasco's tamales, which are usually filled with pork, pejelagarto (large freshwater gar), chicken or even iguana. Other local specialties include meat mixed with rice and wrapped in anise-flavored hierba (or hoja) santa leaves; tamales stuffed with chaya (a chard-like vegetable) or camaron (diced shrimp) and flavored with chipilín (a nutritious legume with a spicy herb taste); and chanchamitas de cerdo, pork seasoned with achiote (the earthy flavor of ground annato seeds).

Especially when they discover their old school is actively blocking them from getting a job or going on to a higher degree.
Cyril boldly asks Samantha if he can live at her house. She agrees to take him on weekends. It works out badly. Fearing rejection, he has a way of testing people beyond their endurance. "Why did you let me come here?" he asks. "I don't know," she says honestly. He keeps running away, and eventually is led into big trouble by Wes, a few years older, who slicks back his black hair, smokes, drinks and leads a "gang." The Dardennes are masterful in showing how easily Wes is able to manipulate Cyril to do his will.
The Wings and Predators have played an even series, just as most people expected. If Franzens near-goal had been a real goal, maybe the Wings would be up, 2-1, right now.

The 3-D gradient is adjustable on the 3DS, or it can be turned off completely.

A. Wakatobi Dive Resort ( wakatobi.com) has a camp-like feeling. It has five-star chefs and three boat dives offered to you on a daily basis. The resort is very small and only holds 55 people with enough staff to meet your every need. I say this is a great place to go for a water lover, scuba diver or book reader. I would wake up every day to a gourmet breakfast, go for a quick swim in the 85 degree water, eat lunch and then enjoy a nice massage in their spa. It is the best place to unwind and hang with people you love.

One of them, the veteran Marvel comics villain Sandman, is an impressive digital creation who looks like a cross between a beige "Hulk" and the silicon swirler in "The Mummy." (His solid-state incarnation, Flint Marko, is played, flintily, by Thomas Haden Church.) A second Marvel staple, the toothsome, fearsome Venom, is another ritualized manifestation of the bad black stuff: He's played in human form by Topher Grace, who has some fun with the role of a sleazy photographer. As if those two weren't enough, Spidey must further contend with the on-again-off-again rage of his erstwhile friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), who holds our hero responsible for the death of Harry's father, the extravagantly crazed Green Goblin, and seeks revenge by transforming himself into the much less extravagant New Goblin.

Memphis would be all about the music. After all, the Tennessee city is home to Beale Street, Sun Studios, Stax Records, the Rock 'n' Soul Museum, a Gibson Guitar Factory, and, of course, Graceland.

The 3-series is still, and again, an excellent car: state-of-the-art driver-assist technologies, great switchgear and materials, flawless dynamics, stellar fuel economy, even with the six-cylinder. Heck, even the trunk is bigger. And yet the F30 project still manages to convey a certain privileged incumbency and laurel-resting about it, if not raw profit-taking. The pace of excellence definitely has slowed with the F30.

The result? Catalonia is the seat of Spanish industry and one of the most important industrial districts in Europe, lagging only the likes of Italy's Lombardy and the German Ruhr in productivity.
