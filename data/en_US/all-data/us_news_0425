In "The Missionary" (1982), Palin plays Reverend Fortescue, who, after 10 years in Africa, has returned to England where a bishop (Denholm Elliott) gives him a challenging new assignment: to save the souls of London's prostitutes. Trevor Howard, looking old and ruddy, plays a wealthy, cantankerous lord whose neglected wife (Maggie Smith) plots to seduce Fortescue. Michael Hordern — who once played Jacob Marley opposite Alastair Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge — is hilarious as Slatterthwaite, an ancient butler who can't find his way around the lord's 400-room, 16th-century castle.

This is not an indication that I feel disenfranchised from our political system. Instead, I feel closer to our elections and governments without have to look through the filter of a political party. I vote in every election, whether we're in the midst of a national election or simply voting on a handful of bond measures. I don't feel pressure to vote for any particular candidate or issue based simply on political affiliation. I am able to base my voting decisions on a candidate's performance, platform and record and not on their political affiliation.

Police said the copper theft epidemic was fueled by heroin.
With filthy spreadsheet in hand, I developed a set of specific categories based on majority results of what people were looking for (and who was seeking the activity) and added categories as I went along. For instance, the numbers told me that in any given "anal" search, the numbers revealed that Men Seeking Women was the majority default for results, and Men Seeking Men was the lesser variable. So either the gay-anal assumptions for "Sodom by the Bay" were wrong (likely), or the gays prefer to use other online hookup services and local community resources for anonymous anal sex.
Once the cake meets heat, magic happens. The unyielding, dense slices yield, and continue to soften the longer the dough cooks.

Habitat for Humanity St. Louis hosted a community meeting March
His vicious elbow didn't just damage Oklahoma City forward James Harden. It damaged World Peace's reputation. His ensuing ejection didn't just hang the Lakers out to dry as they somehow managed to escape with a 114-106 double-overtime victory Sunday over the Oklahoma City Thunder. It left them wondering if they can win without him, since World Peace probably will draw a lengthy suspension. And his apology afterward that it was an "unintentional elbow" isn't just laughable because the Lakers' public relations staff refused to allow him to take follow-up questions. It's head-scratching because the replays show World Peace's blow was hardly an accident.

The great quake of 1933 helped define the region's reputation as "earthquake country." It was the first destructive quake to occur in the region after a period of rapid growth in the early 20th Century. The violent shaking traumatized newcomers -- many of them transplants from the less seismically active Midwest -- and caught government unaware. In the end, the 1933 quake changed the landscape, leading to improved school construction standards and a heightened awareness of earthquake risks.

Hey, Mike: Steinbach is recovered from his back surgery, but the Browns must decide if they want to pay him the $6 million he's due for 2012. If not, they could try to reduce that.

At first I was a little taken aback. I asked why he wanted to keep buying bonds, and my dad said that while he understands his gifts could probably earn more by investing them another way, the bonds represent something meaningful between his grandson and him. My father and his wife are on a fixed income, so there's little chance that Gerald will receive an inheritance. Giving Gerald bonds as gifts is my dad's way of leaving my son an inheritance while he's still alive. "One day I won't be around," he told me. "But when he needs the money for college he'll have those bonds to cash in, and I hope when he does he'll think of me."

So is the win for property rights a Pyrrhic victory for those who worship at the altar of private property rights?

"Everyone who looks at the plus-one model realizes that if you have four teams in play, you're still going to have the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth teams saying we got a bad deal, we should be one of those four teams," he said. "So there'll be continual unrest until you have some kind of a much larger playoff."
Viacom — a giant entertainment conglomerate whose assets include Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central — alleged that YouTube made more than 60,000 snippets of its content available for free, damaging the market for its movies and TV shows. As with so many disputes between copyright holders and tech companies, Viacom's lawsuit against YouTube hinges on the question of how much the website's employees knew or should have known about the files that users were uploading. The 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act shields online companies from liability if they don't have actual knowledge of copyright infringements and aren't aware of "facts or circumstances" that make infringements apparent. But copyright holders and tech companies have fought strenuously over how broad those safe harbors should be.

Another dislocated worker, said, "I had a huge mortgage payment that I knew I couldn't make from the unemployment compensation check. I was afraid of being foreclosed." It was not unusual for these newly dislocated workers to visualize the family being homeless.
We don't advocate burying rubbish in landfills, but increased recycling is a far better and safer answer to the solid waste challenge. It's cheaper, too, if one factors in the high cost of the adverse health effects of trash burning. There's also an urgent need to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. A coastal state like Maryland should be especially sensitive to the threat of rising ocean levels posed by climate change.

Most of these estates, or at least their outer gates and walls, can be glimpsed while driving by, but walking along the beach offers a better view and a peek at the posh oceanside cabanas associated with each mansion.

It's early afternoon and I'm leaning on the dugout rail, staring at an empty baseball field. Ned Yost appears beside me. He's come out to check the weather and we begin to talk about this losing streak. I wanted to know the worst streak he'd ever been in and what got that team out of it. Ned couldn't remember the streak, but he said generally a big hit is what ends them. One of those line-outs or double play balls we've been seeing finds grass and the pressure is off. Life gets back to normal.

Both of these movies were very well made and very divisive, the former for playing off the emotions of 9/11 and the latter for being too artsy-fartsy. Too many haters in both cases. Still, when it's all said and done "The Tree of Life" may wind up being the most remembered and ambitious movie of 2011 and will get the consolation prize of Best Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki.

A year ago, Butler and Connecticut shot 23 percent from 3-point range and 26 percent overall in the national title game at another dome, Reliant Stadium in Houston, looking like they were shooting cannonballs instead of basketballs. A recent USA Today study found that in last year's tournament, teams shot 37 percent in domes and almost 47 percent in non-domes.
It was lucky, then, that Caitlynn & Mitchell drew powerhouse Travis Wall for their second number of the night. It was perfectly synchronized, filled with so many technically difficult moves. It was beautifully sexy. It may have been the performance of the night. Said Mary, "Slightly naughty. A little intense. Gutsy. And I loved it."
The wiretaps began in 2007 and all had ended by August 4, 2008.

Is surgery necessary?
I do understand we are considered fortunate to own a small house and cars, but we really aren't considered rich. My parents work from paycheck to paycheck just to pay bills around the house. This affects me because since I am going to college, college tuition is very expensive, especially when you are working a minimum-wage job. I find myself having to pay almost all of my expenses for school because my parents can't afford it and I want to make something of my life.
Asked about the estimates, Massell said, “We were at the mercy of the state in its calculations.” The interchange “was our top priority, and if it meant continuing the toll, it meant it was a necessary evil.” However, he said, now that the state has good news about the cost of the projects, it can use the extra money to keep up Ga. 400, or reduce the toll.

Wages account for a portion of the agency's $2.56 billion operating budget for 2012, which is far less than the agency's capital sending plan of $3.66 billion. Agency staffing remains flat this budget year, at a level officials say is a 40-year low. Officials said the cuts are in part intended to help avoid layoffs by reducing per capita employee costs.

Using a state-of-the-art operating microscope and with proper surgical technique performed by a microsurgeon who is typically fellowship-trained, the success rate of a vasectomy reversal should be consistently above 90 percent. Sometimes a much more complex microsurgery may be needed if an additional level of blockage is detected during the vasectomy reversal. This blockage is closer to the testicle in a structure called the epididymis and requires a procedure called an epididymovasostomy. In very rare situations, significant scar tissue related to lack of blood supply from prior surgery may prevent a successful vasectomy reversal.
A: We've changed the concept of farm-to-table a little bit. Instead of going to Chino's Farms to buy expensive produce and then charge $30 for a plate of fish and pay for the server and white tablecloth, we've gotten rid of all that and are making it much more accessible for those who want to eat healthier food. It also means supporting the farms more.
Lately, the loft also has served as a refuge for protesters who have been sleeping each night on Wall Street. About a dozen people were at the loft when a city marshal arrived about 1 p.m. to enforce the eviction.
According to criminal complaints filed in the case, Fish was among the most furtive of those caught on surveillance video. He would constantly change cell phones and speak in an amalgam of English, Yiddish and Hebrew, to set up meetings.

Imagine the phone call between me and Siebert:
2. Wall-hung soap dispenser – This is a great accessory for anyone who is tired of having a bottle of liquid soap or a messy bar of soap on the bathroom counter. Plus, many bathroom sinks don't have an extra hole to install an “in-counter” soap dispenser. The slippery solution to both issues is a wall-hung dispenser. Also, if your dispenser is up on the wall, you'll gain more counter space.

Fay was "one of the ringleaders who created the independent movement to get the disability community organized," said former California congressman Tony Coelho, who has epilepsy and was the original sponsor of the landmark legislation. "People liked to pat us on the head and say 'Don't worry, we'll take care of you.' Fred was one of those who said, 'Thank you, but we'd like to take care of ourselves.' "
The REITs have to distribute at least 90 percent of their taxable income. As a C-Corp, we can choose to distribute that in the form of a dividend or reinvest it. During this financial crisis that we went through, arguably the worst financial crisis since the Depression, we quit paying a dividend. We're not paying a dividend right now, because we made a determination that we still have higher and better uses for the capital. And we're still operating in a very tax-efficient manner.

Presque Isle State Park, 301 Peninsula Drive #1, Erie, Pa., 814-833-7424: OK, it's not in Northeast Ohio. It's not even in Ohio. But this fantastic Erie beach is just an hour-and-a-half away by car -- and worth traveling much farther for. Located on an arching, 3,200-acre sandy peninsula that juts four miles into Lake Erie, it's arguably the best beach on the whole lake. In addition to swimming, boating, fishing and hiking, it also offers excellent migratory bird viewing.
Detective Rebecca Madison (Sarah Jones) is still reeling from seeing her partner die months earlier when she's sent to investigate a homicide that an FBI team, led by Emerson Hauser (Sam Neill), quickly swoops in to take over. But a fingerprint leads her to an Alcatraz inmate who clearly couldn't be the perpetrator. Or could he? After all, the victim was a former warden at the prison.

In the past in East Orange there were up to 140 "affidavit buildings." Landlords or building management sign an affidavit with the police department that gives officers access — either with keys or access codes — to patrol indoor common areas.

Kinkade's paintings depicting dreamy scenes of candlelit cottages, stone bridges and garden gates was shunned by art critics as tacky and kitsch but adored by Main Street Americans when reproduced on affordable canvasses, coffee cups and calendars. By 2005, the company was one of the top 50 licensed brands in the country, with more retail sales than MTV, said Dan Byrne, former president and chief executive officer of the Morgan Hill-based Thomas Kinkade empire. Kinkade and his founding partner, Ken Raasch, came up with the idea of "painter of light" on a road trip.
An inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in March. Over the past 12 months, the index is up 2.1 percent, just above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for consumer inflation.
CH: Initially, both Leon and I were collecting interesting historic views and Leon would then go shoot a current photo. It took two years to get a wide array of photos and information together, at which point we began the writing of the accompanying text. It was not an immediate conscious decision to divide the book as we did, but it just seemed to naturally flow in that direction. Leon, the Planning Board member and photographer of countless historic sites, began writing about pictures from an architectural viewpoint whereas I, the former teacher, dove right into to the history of the school system. Leon and I share a love of the historic but it is our divergent interests in history-his being in the structures and mine in the people who used those structures-that made us a well-matched team.
Anything that helps the public make a realistic evaluation would be in DeWine's -- or any other politician's -- best interests, too.
The panel, formally known as the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, was created two years by President Barack Obama to find new strategies for managing the nation's growing inventory of nuclear waste.

But the Lazarus story is also about rising from the dead. Are Pete and Don both approaching some figurative death that inspires a rebirth? Certainly, Don is being tested, as this episode includes more suggestions that Don, like Roger, just wasn't made for these times. When Roger comes into Don's office to talk about Megan's decision to quit Sterling Cooper Draper Price, Don confesses to Roger -- someone who understands -- how hard it is to grasp the idea of someone leaving a steady job to follow an uncertain dream. "I was raised in the '30s," Don says. "My dream was indoor plumbing."

Both players, and the driver of the vehicle — which belonged to Stoudamire — were cited for misdemeanor possession. Officers allowed the three to continue their drive to Portland after determining the driver was not under the influence.
It's easy to run against the Legislature, but there are good lawmakers. The next governor should set up portfolios - for corrections, education, transportation, etc. - and ask problem solvers from both parties to find ways to cut costs and improve services.

If George fancies himself the next great Pacer, the next in line behind Miller, he needs to -- yes -- be more assertive and do more than just the other things.
The officers took cover in time to avoid injury, then turned to shoot back. It was too risky, they decided, because they might hit bystanders. Instead, they chased the suspect, who was still armed, up North Broad and called for assistance. The person, who still had a handgun, was eventually captured.
"It's a judgment call," Matheny said. "I'll give it to them that both of them were close. Both of them worked against us. Both of them really hurt us."

Two decades before Arizona became a state, the Sussex family settled on a patch of Tempe land where generations witnessed the city grow up around their property.
Elkin Kistner, representing Breitenfeld, called the study "unreliable." Among the problems with the study, he said, is that it assumes that parents knew about the transfer law before they were contacted for the survey.

I believe in the governor's power to grant clemency, but I granted fewer than 10 pardons or reprieves in my first term as governor. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, my staff just didn't have time to deal with the issue, so at the end of my first term I pardoned only the inmates who had worked successfully at the governor's mansion that term.

The smell of sewage wafts through the air.
Forget about developing markets for Asian carp around the world or putting a bounty on them. There is no future in embracing Asian carp and trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

It was unfortunate so much emotion was going on at that time. That's it for today."

If the toilet is running, for example, one way to figure out what's going on is to add a little food dye to the water in the tank, said Long, of Home Depot. If the water in the bowl turns the same color, the flapper valve is likely the problem. The flapper seals the tank, then lifts to allow water to flow into the bowl when the toilet is flushed. If the seal isn't tight, water will leak into the bowl.

American greatness is not inevitable, just as success here typically is not inherited. Both are earned, and not easily. Each generation is presented with challenges, some larger than others, and each generation is forced to choose whether to face them or shrink from them. Mr. Eastwood's ad was a reminder that we are not a nation of shrinkers. We have the power to make a better future for our children, just as our parents did for us. We will have to work for it, but that is what we as a people have always done, and we can do it again.

You can do the same with Rachel Hawkins' third "Hex Hall" novel, "Spell Bound" — and when you're done, you can click over to a feature in which designer Tanya Ross-Hughes describes how she created the cover of the book. It's the kind of thing adults take for granted, but for a young reader, especially one who wants to be involved with writing, it can be a way of making publishing accessible, a way to be drawn in. "It's an opportunity for publishers," Lewis says, "but it's also an opportunity for us to create a home for larger conversations about books."

* One more thing: some will say that the Cardinals, in their dealings with Pujols, should have taken the approach that the Reds' used with Votto. Sorry, not the same. Not even close. The Votto deal happened because of the Pujols/Fielder contracts. Pujols and Fielder re-set the template for contracts given to proven power-hitting first basemen. The Pujols-Fielder deals dramatically changed the market. Without Pujols and Fielder shaking up the paradigm, the Reds wouldn't have been anything near 10 years, $225 million for Votto. Some will say: well what about Philadelphia giving Ryan Howard five years at $25 million a year two seasons ago? The Cardinals should have made their move then, right? That's simplistic for this reason: Pujols would have never under any circumstances accepted a five-year deal, even if it beat Howard's AAV by a wide margin. Not a chance. The starting point for Team Pujols was the Alex Rodriguez deal, 10 years for $275 million. There was zero chance of the Cardinals giving Pujols that kind of deal in advance.

Oversalting was an issue at my first meal, spoiling the mashed potatoes beneath a rack of lamb that, at $30, was oddly $10 more than most of the other reasonable entrees.

That’s not to say Luck is the wrong choice for the Colts. He should eventually round into an elite NFL quarterback. It’s just that the Colts have been stripped to the framing and need to rebuild. Remember, Peyton Manning had 28 interceptions his rookie year and his team finished 3-13. Luck will have lots of leeway in his first season. This draft could be an ultra-rare one in which quarterbacks were selected 1-2 and both went on to play at a high level.

Jared Polis and Ed Perlmutter recently voted for a compromise budget that did just that).

She looks like the quintessential San Francisco hipster: Tight-fitting crop tops, dark blue baggy jeans and bright red lipstick against her pale skin and jet-black short hair. As she flits about chopping lemons and crushing ice, she regales customers with tales from her life -- like the time she was looking for a roommate. "I wrote that I collect modern furniture, I keep really late hours and I like cocktails," she says. "People will respond that they're a vegan, they teach Bikram yoga and they get up at 5 o'clock in the

Equally wonderful is Ngu Binh, where owner Mai Tran, having recently moved from a pint-size space to a much larger one in the same mall, has seriously upgraded her restaurant's appeal by replacing the former funky untranslated Xeroxed menu with a shiny new photo-illustrated one. Now you can see that banh beo dia, silver-dollar size rice cakes, are served on a plate, whereas even thinner banh beo chen come in the little saucers in which they were steamed. Both, topped with shrimp and crunchy, porky mini chicharrones, are another ode to textural contrast.
Corbett, an award-winning journalist and author, spent countless hours traversing the dusty stretch of Old U.S. 50 that lies between Salt Lake City and Reno, Nev., while researching his two books, "The Poker Bride" and "Orphans Preferred: The Twisted Truth and Lasting Legend of The Pony Express."

The largest increases in homeless populations are notable for where they are occurring: in the suburban rings around cities. Anne Arundel County has seen a 231 percent increase in homeless students since 2005, Baltimore County a 140 percent increase and Howard County a 150 percent increase. The increase in Baltimore City, which still has the largest number of homeless students, was 75 percent.

The Getty museum, backed by a fortune left by its namesake, is the largest part of a massive hilltop cultural center on 24 acres. It includes superb collections of Old Master paintings, photography, 18th-century French decorative art and more. To reach it, visitors have to pay for parking and ride a tram up a mountainside. It's not a casual, drop-in experience.

This is a bar that serves as a glowing billboard for its namesake Oliver Ales, but in addition to a comatose vibe, it is set back by spotty service and lackluster cocktails.

With the loss, Rutgers is now 0-7 all-time against the No. 2-ranked team in the country. The highest-ranked team that the Scarlet Knights have ever defeated was that Feb. 27, 1982 game against West Virginia. ... Gilvydas Biruta's big day marked the first time this season that the sophomore has scored over 20 points. He's previous high in points came at Providence last season. ... Rutgers actually out-rebounded Syracuse, by a 34-29 margin. The Scarlet Knights held the Orange to six rebounds below their season average. ... At times, it seemed like the Syracuse Air Show Sunday afternoon. The Orange flushed eight dunks, with C.J. Fair putting down four of them. ... Speaking of dunks, Biruta flushed two Sunday afternoon, giving him a team-high 14 on the season. ... The loss gives Rutgers 10 losses in conference play and assures the Scarlet Knights of their 12th consecutive losing season in the Big East. Not since the 2001-02 season, when Rutgers went 8-8, has the program been at least .500 in league play. ... Among those in attendance Sunday were Eric LeGrand, Pittsburgh Steeler offensive lineman Darnell Stapleton and Indianapolis Colts linebacker Gary Brackett.

Gentz's court-appointed lawyer, Susan Reed, said any lapse in reading Gentz his rights to remain silent and to have an attorney "could be really crucial" if criminal charges are brought against her client in the Jan. 24 slaying. She declined to comment specifically on whether Gentz was told of his rights.
The restaurant industry would probably not support this measure. Apart from the cost of printing new menus, restaurants make more money when we buy huge portions. Large meals require a decreasing marginal cost of production, yet people have been willing to pay more for additional portions of food, and restaurants use this to maximize profit.
Many locals, such as Elean S. of Ormond Beach, said she and her husband gave up their walks on beaches that allow cars after too many "near misses" — even when walking in the shallow surf. "It's just not worth it," Elean said. "It can't be both a playground and a highway. It's one or the other."

For example, smoke-free outdoor areas, such as college campuses, restaurant patios, parks and beaches, can support healthy, smoke-free environments that help prevent butt waste deposition. Other actions could include better enforcement of existing litter/pollution violations; labeling cigarettes as toxic waste; raising the visibility of the butt waste environmental impact through various advertisements, social media and public service announcements; and mandatory "take back" policies, with the onus placed on the tobacco industry to assure safe disposal of butt waste. Some communities have placed more butt waste receptacles on sidewalks, beaches and in parks; this is great as a short term response, but more upstream solutions are needed.

The talk about Cassel isn’t new, of course, and around Kansas City it’s probably been exaggerated past the point of truth. As I’ve written here before, Cassel is more like the Corolla of quarterbacks: reliable, no-thrills-no-frills, able to get you from here to there but not the kind of car that will win you a race.

"Do you have any evidence that supports who may have started the fight?"
WASHINGTON — Roger Clemens' lawyer wagged his finger. His voice cracked. He called himself Columbo. He claimed evidence had been manipulated. He appealed to the jurors' hearts as well as their heads in his opening statement yesterday in defense of the seven-time Cy Young Award winner.
This is great stuff for the interest of the U.S., not to mention the Middle East itself. The people there want jobs and security. They want to get married and have families. They are tired of oppression and extremism. Sure, they have some rough times to get through and the learning curve for governance is long and difficult. But because of the Obama administration the U.S. finds itself on the right side of history. Instead of the empty bluster of a Dick Cheney creating enemies and ridicule at every turn, we have smart power sculpting events behind the scenes.

McDermott left her $116,019-a-year job under never-explained circumstances. York said she doesn't object to Faith's measure "except why is the state telling the city to do this?" without a limitation on state employee buyouts.

On Thursday, Novitzky sat about 20 feet from Clemens and methodically described the physical evidence he had collected from Clemens' former strength coach, which prosecutors hope will prove the former baseball pitcher did in fact use steroids and HGH. Novitzky, a tall man with a shaved head, deep voice and authoritative manner, spoke clearly and confidently, often making eye contact with the jury.
One aspect that can be quantified is the federal contracts that DeMaio received. He was able to get The Performance Institute on a special schedule for vendors that allow them to compete for contracts with each other rather than on the open market. Critics say that DeMaio's connections to the Bush administration helped get him into that exclusive club.

Her wraparound work blurs distinctions between utility and composition, abstraction and physical presence. Functional things such as electrical outlets and a fire alarm take on a decorative flair, and double doors begin to seem like a sculpture in their own right. Human presence isn't the first thing Ding's work evokes, but it's intriguing to imagine her installation/painting as a blueprint also for psychological complexities.
Graham and Ayanbadejo are the third and fourth free agents the Ravens have signed this offseason, with Graham being the first from another team. The Ravens also brought back veteran center Matt Birk and re-signed linebacker Chavis Williams, who played mostly on special teams last season.

When Colombian-born Tata Harper's stepfather was diagnosed with cancer in 2002, his doctor advised him to stop using personal-care products. This got her thinking about the potential dangers in mainstream offerings and took her on a five-year global quest to bring to market skin-care products "that actually work and won't sacrifice our health," says Harper, an industrial engineer.

So proud, and so willing to look the other way. There was ample room for Ohio State to have been embarrassed before. Maurice Clarett, the best player on the 2002 national championship team in Tressel's second season; Troy Smith, the 2006 Heisman Trophy winner; and Terrelle Pryor, the starting quarterback for most of the past three seasons, were the highest-profile players of the Tressel era. They were all suspended for receiving improper benefits.
The Thunder have an eye on the Finals this year, as well they should. They are bringing back their core players (Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins, James Harden) virtually untouched. Perkins has lost weight, Harden and Ibaka figure to continue their improvement and Westbrook and Durant are already well established stars. Team stability is rare in the West this year, and the shortened schedule should be a bonus for Oklahoma City. They’re a good bet to return to the West finals—and probably can go beyond that.
Now into midwinter, the menswear scene in San Francisco could be forgiven for hitting a bit of a lull. The sales racks are picked near clean by the carrion dogs of deep discounts, and though spring gear is starting to bud in some local shops, it's yet to fully bloom.

You approach two young women, who don't look to be the type to frequent a joint like this, but here they are. They say they're tourists from Memphis. They look honest, wholesome, not yet beaten down by the naked city. You take them at their word. You ask why they've come here.
Consider the current trend: Gibson Ranch will shutter next Monday as supervisors consider proposals to lease it to outside groups, including a private developer who hopes to make money off the park. Unable to find funds for the Effie Yeaw Nature Center in the American River Parkway, the county turned it over to the American River Natural History Association earlier this year.
Wild Wasabe is closed now. Late Friday afternoon, a Volvo station wagon plowed through the east wall of the building on Northwest Thurman Street, crashing through tables and chairs and injuring at least two people before breaking the opposite window and finally stopping.

Painting in this year's show is particularly strong, with powerful examples including Andy Hunt's "Icon II," a wall-size canvas in oil and gold leaf that reinterprets the face of a beautiful young starlet by slicing it into geometric fragments and rearranging it, Cubist-style.
