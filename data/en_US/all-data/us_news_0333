The Yizkor service this year will be particularly difficult for my family and me. Our mother and grandmother, Marilyn Roger, died two weeks ago, and her death is too new for us.

And we will tell her story over and over again, for the telling is praise.

Naturally, this leads to sibling competition that will always be present between the two. Thus, a pattern develops of who tattled last, what type of repercussion was received for which action and will pretty much continue for the next 10 or so years.

And if that's what companies are doing, shouldn't we at least know about it?

Cochineal, like pink slime, is one of those previously little known and perhaps off-putting facts of food production. But it's by no means a dangerous product, as far as anyone knows. Vegetarians would understandably be unwilling to use it, and now that more people know about it and are grimacing over the idea of eating food with bugs in it, there might be a bigger push against this ancient red dye.

When 10-year-old Michael's family moves to a new community, the shy but friendly and athletic boy enjoys an idyllic summer playing games, wrestling, swimming and basking in nature. He even has a kid romance with Lisa, a girl who has a crush on him because he's not like the other boys.

The Porchistas and Bern and the Brights played, of course. So did some of North Jersey’s most popular left-of the-dial attractions: Clifton-based ’80s-revivalists the Frozen Gentlemen, Jersey City soul act the One and Nines, Wayne’s string-drenched, psychedelic Waking Lights, soulful Like Trains and Taxis from New Brunswick. In a throwback to the old Independent Music Festivals that lit up the New Brunswick skyline in the late ’90s and became mini-conventions for Jersey bands — chances for musicians from all over the state to catch up on what their peers were doing — more than 20 bands compared notes and chords in the Essex County city.

The world's first parliament was established there in A.D. 930, on a site overlooking vast, rippling lava fields cut by the crystal-clear Oxara River. A gorge at one end is filled with water so clear I saw coins, tossed in for good luck, resting on the bottom seven feet down.

But most members of Louisville's new City Council represent formerly suburban districts, and critics of the new system say it has shifted resources and development to the fringes at the expense of working-class neighborhood in the region's core. Members of the city's black community say they have lost their political voice. As University of Louisville researchers Henry Savitch and Ronald Vogel put it in one paper, the merger created "Suburbs Without a City."

This hope proves to be the seed of his possible undoing as well as his possible salvation. The reward for becoming a true adult, as anyone will tell you, is the ability to love. McGuane has birthed a man, huge-hearted, hapless, yes, clueless, particularly when it comes to emotional dealings with women. (Really, Berl, an affair with the wife of the hospital administrator!

As John Stossel points out in his great new book, "No They Can't, Why Government Fails -- but Individuals Succeed," we are convinced by liberal academia and the mainstream media that politicians are somehow heroic. In annual Harris Interactive polls, people were asked to name their heroes. In 2001, Jesus Christ won. In 2009, Obama won, followed closely by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.
He also noted that a "smaller version" of the marketplace that wouldn't cross into Wells Fargo's lot is "still doable" if the bank can't be swayed.
Augusta has never admitted a woman to membership, and has even tried to portray its adamantine stance as a virtue: When activist Martha Burk launched a public challenge to its males-only membership policy in 2002, then-Chairman Hootie Johnson declared that the club would admit women at some time in the future, but not "at the point of a bayonet." It must be a long bayonet, because the club still hasn’t budged.
First off, the whole point of the federal research program is to find a technology that is unobtrusive, making it a far cry from existing interlock systems -- which seem partially designed to humiliate those forced to install them because having a tube attached to one's ignition signals to everybody who gets in the car that the driver has a drinking problem. The two most promising technologies under study are tissue spectrometry, which would use a touchpad and lasers to detect alcohol in human tissue, and distant spectrometry, in which sensors installed throughout the cabin could sniff a driver's breath automatically every time he or she gets in the car (apparently, the sensors can be placed in such as way as to ensure it's the driver's breath they're sniffing, not passengers').

There's always plenty to do in Chicago, but the people are real.
Now, though, the crowd — announced at 42,080, the largest in the building’s history, though there were more than a couple empty patches — had grown quiet and solemn.

Rather than fixating on deficit targets, official Europe should be watching the danger lurking in Spanish banks. Like the Irish, Spaniards overinvested in property during the easy-money days, and banks' losses on residential mortgage-backed securities will probably trigger some form of public support as the housing bubble deflates further. Irish property values halved between peak and trough, whereas Spanish real-estate prices have so far only fallen about a quarter from their 2007 highs.

Besides the "99 Problems" gamble, Lucca and coach Adam turned in a pretty and sparse "Yesterday" and Lucca honored coach Adam by covering Maroon 5's "Harder to Breathe" which was harder to remember since he missed a lyric and told Adam, "Dude, that song has a lot of words." Lucca can still win this thing on an anti-Christina platform alone but I'm willing to bet he won't do anything but siphon away votes from "Opera Mann."

First, America is a united country. Malawi is composed of many tribes, and although they coexist peacefully for the most part, tribal tensions are a clear and present danger. Politicians accuse one another of practicing tribal favoritism and at nationwide gatherings, Malawians from different tribes interact with each other reluctantly.

No one has ever seen its pollinator in action; some speculate that it may be the elusive green sphinx moth, or something even more rare, if not extinct. Botanical garden botanists have rappelled down the vertical cliffs to hand-pollinate alula plants in situ. Alula has been successfully propagated by Martin Grantham at San Francisco State University, among others - but is hard to keep alive. An attempted introduction at Kilauea Point is looking unsuccessful. It really misses its cliffs, where it's being displaced by the likes of invasive sanseveria, the familiar houseplant "mother-in-law's tongue."

øA: We've won some enormous victories. If you were to go back and look at the rates of cardiovascular disease and how they've fallen steadily over the last 25 years, there were two big factors. Changes in lifestyle, such as less consumption in meat, saturated fat, and smoking rates that have declined substantially. That's had a huge impact. And fabulous developments by industry. The modern pacemakers and defibrillators, the statin drugs, the better blood pressure drugs. All of these things have had enormous impact. Now the progress has slowed. Cancer has been a tougher road. There have been a lot of improvements, but they've been small and incremental. The really bad actors in cancer are still bad actors: pancreatic cancer, certain forms of lung cancer. We are extending lives of those patients, but we're not yet curing most patients. We need some breakthroughs here.
The XL expansion would allow the company to pump its heated slurry of sludge-like crude oil and solvent from storage sites near Calgary, Alberta, to refining facilities near Houston and Port Arthur, Texas.

In Michigan, the attorney general took the rare step in June of filing criminal subpoenas to out-of-state mortgage processing companies after 23 county registers of deeds filed a criminal complaint with his office over robo-signed documents they say they have received. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office has said it is conducting a banking probe that could lead to criminal charges against financial executives. The attorneys general of Delaware, California and Illinois are conducting their own probes.
Pastas cover the breadth of Italy, depending on the season and Smulewitz's whims. On the night I visited, house-made spaghetti was being tossed with a punchy combination of sardines, currants and pine nuts ($14) -- very Sicilian.

“We are not overreacting — we need to be ready for this,” said Christie, who urged people not to go to the Shore this weekend. “I’ve lived here my whole life and I understand the cry wolf syndrome. This is not one of those circumstances.”
Schoeneberg described Potter as a good mother who was very attentive to Wyatt. She took the child for regular checkups, and the baby was well-nourished. Potter had been up with Wyatt the entire night before the day he died, he said.

"I trust their opinions. They call you by name. This is a mystery store, and they know everything about it," said a regular, Portland resident John Tucker.
"He's a little bit more comfortable and can be who he really is," Wade said. "Last year was tough. I'm sure no one can deal with the things he dealt with publicly and all the scrutiny that he took. I thought he did a good job with it. This year it's a little bit more quiet and he can just focus on being LeBron James, the family man and the athlete and not everything else.
He cares now. That's why he showed up at that rally in Columbus and made those opponents of health care reform confront the reality of Robert A. Letcher.

"What happens on Wall Street has a direct impact on what happens on Main Street," said William Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities. "An adverse bond rating translates into additional costs that the taxpayers are going to have to foot the bill for."
According to the Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem for 2009-10, the average age in a nonreligious neighborhood is 40, while in a religious neighborhood it is 20 (in the ultra-orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, the average age is 15!). In Jewish elementary schools in the city, the number of ultra-orthodox pupils is twice as big as the others. Again, it gives a clear idea of what the future holds for Jerusalem: more poor people leaning on a smaller middle class to support them.

Many double-dipping homeowners told The Sun they had no idea they were getting an inappropriate credit. Some said they lived in a home before renting it out. For decades, the credit was applied automatically if buyers indicated at settlement that they intended to live in the home.
Something extra: If you go downstairs and look toward the street side of the closest wall, you will see a door. It takes you a minute to realize that you are below street level. In fact, it is one of the entrances to Old Sacramento's historic underground spaces, created years ago when the district was raised by one level to combat flooding. You can reserve a visit to the space through www.historicoldsac.org, but don't ask Shaffer to go through the door. He will just look at you like you are crazy.Mandango's

Some have questioned whether this is a “proper” activity for a girl. Others ask if it is healthy for any prepubescent to lift.
Since The Rock uttered these words after a seven year absence from WWE, we have wondered exactly what they meant – we all knew that he had obligations outside of WWE, and wouldn't be back every single week on WWE TV (nor would some people even want him around every single week on WWE TV). This past Monday on RAW, he vaguely clarified what “never, ever going away” meant: loosely, it means he will appear from time to time, with always something to look forward to in the sometimes-distant future.
Just making it to the international competition was an honor for the Cyborg Cats of Westminster Christian Academy. Craig Nitcher, 52, of Arnold, whose son Lucas, 17, is a team member, said they didn't make the finals, but they enjoyed an inspiring rookie season. "They are really jazzed," Nitcher said.
It's true that Obama canceled a ceremony at the White House, but it wouldn't have been the 21st annual one for the National Day of Prayer. Several other claims in the chain e-mail also are incorrect, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

Smyly allowed only one run for the game, a home run by Carlos Pena. But he only lasted four-plus innings because he didn't throw enough strikes. I guess you could say Smyly was "effectively wild," but frankly, I prefer pitchers to be wildly effective.

He said the Israeli delegation plans to observe a private ceremony, and that IOC President Jacques Rogge is expected to attend.
Chronicle is full of smart writing that isn't too smart. Matt Garetty (Alex Russell) is the cool intellectual snob of the trio, name-dropping Plato, Schopenhauer, and Jung - and getting his comeuppance when the three friends go to a rave, and the girl he admires from afar quips, "What did Jung have to say about Glow Sticks?"
Federal courts have jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of state laws—even those approved by voters as a ballot initiative—and have developed specific tests to do so. For instance, because the Constitution requires states to provide "equal protection of the laws," measures that treat people differently can be found unconstitutional, as the Ninth Circuit did with Proposition 8.

Athletes from both eras are united in their love of the sport and thrill of competing to the limits of their capabilities.
But by the late 1920s, the new U.S. 101 had drawn businesses from the bay front to the town center, and also signaled the end of an era when visitors came and stayed for weeks. With WWII came gas rationing. There were blackouts and people feared the Japanese awaited off the coast. "During the '30s and '40s, it was pretty lonely place," says Jody Weeber, archivist for the Oregon Coast History Center. "But it's always bounced back. Buildings change and owners change, but there is always the same kind of character."

The mechanism that will save the European monetary union is the increasing volume of financial transfers that will have to be sent to euro-zone countries suffering from the biggest economic and financial problems. Yet everyone knows that sending massive financial transfers is possible only in a state, and the EU, or the euro zone, is not a state. Only in a state there is a sufficient feeling of solidarity among its citizens. Only in a state—and unified Germany in the 1990s is an excellent example—can massive financial transfers be justified and made politically viable. (By the way, the inter-German financial transfers in that era annually equaled the whole sum potentially needed for Greece to survive). Twenty years ago, I happened to be the minister of finance in a dissolving political—and monetary—union called Czechoslovakia. I have to confess that the country broke up because of the lack of mutual solidarity.

A: Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a case of chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in nerve cells. It then can reactivate years later and cause shingles. This occurs in approximately one million people a year. It is unclear what causes this re-emergence of the varicella virus to cause shingles. You will never get shingles if you never had chickenpox.

"He was just so gracious … he was on his oxygen machine, and he was ready to teach me right there," Landeza says, although he jokes that Kane never remembered his name: "He always called me Berkeley!"
Anyway, I was determined never to be cold in Chicago, so I took myself to the Army-Navy store in Ambridge, Pa., and bought what was billed as an "Air Force Flight Jacket." The tag even said so. I don't recall the price, but I am sure it was well under $100.
At its north end, the corridor terminates at a great arched door facing Kelly Drive. It is the only place where you can enter the building at street level. The entrance also lines up perfectly with the door to the Perelman Building, on the opposite side of the drive.
These guys got together at an artist residency in Crete and the drummer's dad is Yes guitarist Trevor Rabin. That's a pretty good back story, but what ultimately matters is the undeniably contagious pop appeal of "Never Trust a Happy Song" -- a "positively euphoric debut," as Q magazine put it. If you think you've never heard them, chances are you have. There's an iPod commercial with "Tongue Tied" in it (first line: "Take me to your best friend's house ... ").

The self-reported data were supported by observations of the timing of orders issued for patient care. Five percent more orders were placed before 7 a.m. rounds than before iPads were in the wards. Eight percent more orders were placed prior to the time teams were scheduled to leave the hospital than before the iPads were handed out.
As for James Van Der Beek, he is played by James Van Der Beek, and he's terrific, as are the two actresses in the lead roles. Like Matt LeBlanc on "Episodes" and Neil Patrick Harris in the "Harold and Kumar" movies, JVDB plays an exaggerated (one hopes) version of himself as a pompous, self-involved dolt who fancies himself a Shakespearean actor. He also dresses up like Indiana Jones' father to teach acting classes to college students who just want him to do speeches from "Dawson's Creek" or tell them what it was like kissing Katie Holmes. Clips from fake commercials he's done and a fake role in a Guy Ritchie movie are hysterical.
Archaeologists unearthed its hard surface in 1918, but at first they didn't realize this might have been a ball court. It wasn't until a much larger court with definitive markers was discovered at Snaketown on the Gila River Indian Community near Phoenix during an excavation in the 1930s that the ballcourts were recognized as such.
Adolf Hitler'sNazis murdered 6 million Jews — 6 million girls, men, grandmothers, babies, uncles, neighbors, women, fathers, friends, sisters, colleagues, cousins, lovers, boys, mothers, aunts — 6 million human beings. Though Hitler's main target was Jews, he also exterminated 5 million other people, mostly Catholics, homosexuals, gypsies and the handicapped, to support his master race ambition.
Today, the building is fully leased, with 5,000 office workers and three stories devoted to Macy's, which took over in 2006. After Wanamakers went bankrupt in the 1990s, a procession of other stores - Hecht's, Strawbridge's, Lord & Taylor - came and went.

Lynn can appreciate offense, even if it isn't his. The Cardinals haven't had all their offense on the field for even one game this season and Lynn said, "That just shows you how deep our bench is, when you've got (Lance) Berkman out and you've got guys playing great."
A few of the Admiral's long-ago passengers showed up on the riverfront to say goodbye to the old boat, which cruised the Mississippi for nearly 40 years. Among them were Jim and Patti Rodgers of St. Louis County, who said the Admiral was their favorite dating spot in the late 1950s.

In that nickel look, starting safety Jermale Hines said he will probably slide down into his old spot at the star position, replacing Moeller/Bryant, while senior Aaron Gant moves into Hines' safety spot. Gant is a big hitter who has battled injuries his whole career.
When powered bikes become numerous enough or there is a bad enough accident, something made more likely by their higher possible speeds, the city may take more notice, he said.
I firmly believe that residents should pay their water bills, and my proposed moratorium does not suggest otherwise. But I've heard from countless residents, like Lillie Oliver and Jeanette Mellerson, who are extremely frustrated with the current system. They have lost faith that the problem can be corrected. That's why, until the billing system has been fixed, I feel strongly that no house should be sold through an auction solely because of an unpaid water bill.

Regarding "Feds raid hospital in fraud probe" (Page A1, Friday), we read article after article about hospital fraud. Exploiting the mentally ill for millions of dollars of profit is about the lowest level of behavior I can imagine. How do these hospitals and clinics manage to operate? Throw in the hundreds of private ambulances bringing in any number of the mentally fragile for what seems to be little or no therapy. Who is responsible for monitoring?
While prosecutors point fingers at Young and Mock, the defendants - through their lawyers - pointed fingers at each other.
Industry leaders have said New Jersey will suffer economically and environmentally if the remaining racetracks don’t get financial help.

While exploring Kauai's Na Pali Coast, I was struck by how this landscape is shaped by the forces of weather and waves. Sunset brought good light and the dramatic sky I was looking for. Acting quickly in the changing light, I set my tripod over a pool just outside the reach of incoming waves. A slow shutter implied the motion of the surf, while a graduated filter balanced the bright sky with the foreground.

What the trigger is we do not know. What is interesting, though, is that many of the same sharks return year after year and this is their hunting ground and kingdom. What is even more fascinating is that each individual great white shark has its own personality.

It's a sound premise, but only to the extent that the candidates can plausibly out-Reagan Reagan. If the commitment to limiting government is the decisive factor, things in the 1980s should have turned out a lot better for conservatives than they did. The GOP candidates who suggest that they will succeed where Reagan failed are implying that the Gipper spent too much time on the sidelines during the contest against big government. The problem with this is not that it flunks the piety test but that it flunks the laugh test -- Ronald Reagan was not just pretending to be a Reagan Republican.

There is a large monkey population on Bali. The island is a little paradise for them, a Hindu haven, in the midst of a primarily Muslim archipelago. In the Hindu world, monkeys occupy a liminal space, their agile forms jumping with lightning speed from the world of men to the natural realm to the sacred precincts of the gods. In the leafy enclave we were visiting, they were pretty much holy, and they knew it. And like all gods, these monkeys were not exactly patient or deferential toward the humans who came calling. We'd been warned not to go in the morning when they were hungry as they could be very aggressive. But in the afternoon, after they'd eaten, they'd be dangerous for other reasons. I have a friend who was once peed down upon by angry monkeys in the trees overhead. At first he thought it was raining.

Both are projected to hit 30 home runs and more than 100 RBIs by the end of the season, and they are aided by a lineup that includes 2011 All-Stars Jhonny Peralta and Alex Avila. The starting rotation, regardless of who ends up the No. 5 starter, should be one of the best in baseball with right-handers Justin Verlander, Doug Fister, Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello.

It wasn't until the mid-'80s that Chilton returned to making records, and his music took another turn, more relaxed and bluesy and about evenly split between covers and original songs, with a generally lighter feel than much of his crucial '70s work.

Season recap: The early season mistakes kept Catalina's coaches scratching their heads, but when they put their heads together they fixed the problems. After Gabusi moved some players to different positions, Catalina started to jell. Still, the team finished third in its region and lost its regular season finale, which didn't sit well with the club, Gabusi said. Motivated to prove that it was still worthy of winning a state championship, Catalina won its Class 4A Division II state opener. The No. 6 state seed then proceeded to beat the Nos. 3, 2 and 1 seeds in that order to win the program's first state title since 1967. Catalina scored seven runs in the ninth inning of the title game to break a 1-1 tie against No. 1 seed Phoenix Thunderbird and win 8-4. Catalina finished its season with a 22-11 record.

The days leading up to the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death, capped by President Obama's night flight to Kabul, brought foreign policy to the forefront of the presidential campaign.

It's a pleasure to find that Fresnadillo has assumed the mantle of horror classicist to make "Intruders," using shadows and directorial sleights of hand to coax forth its slow-building scares rather than just pouring on the usual guts and gore. This restraint is especially welcome given that his last outing as a director was "28 Weeks Later," the disappointing, bludgeoning sequel to Danny Boyle's excellent zombie movie "28 Days Later." For "Intruders," Fresnadillo has slowed the pace, dimmed the lights and trained his camera on the faces of characters you may actually want to see make it out alive and in one piece, unlike the disposable young things of many contemporary horror flicks whose idiocy and one-dimensionality almost beg for your sadism.
