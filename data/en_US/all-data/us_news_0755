Even if the Big East loses its BCS status, SDSU is making the move to the Big East primarily for TV money. SDSU expects to increase its TV revenue from about $1.5 million annually in the Mountain West to at least $6.4 million in the Big East.

Big East will begin negotiating a new TV contract in September, and the exact figure won't be known until a new agreement is reached.

Costumes aside, you can get in the spirit of the holiday with clothes in traditional Easter colors like yellow, pink, light blue, lavender and green.

We don't expect government to generate income. We expect taxpayer-funded services to be delivered on a not-for-profit basis, and when we think that's not happening, we get grouchy. Mention of tolls for new bridges evokes firestorms of protest. Portland's hastily implemented leaf-removal fee caused such blowback that the city instituted an opt-out program, the administration of which may well cost as much as the removal fees would have generated. When Portland contemplated the purchase of Portland General Electric, most folks said "no way," and bills that once read "City of Portland Utilities" have returned to reading "Portland Water Bureau."

Another saving grace is the restaurant's newfound lunch service. The menu is an abbreviated version of dinner, and it's at it best when, once again, the kitchen embraces simplicity: crispy beer-battered cod with those fantastic matchstick fries, tender mussels steamed in white wine, a decent shrimp scampi. Most successful is an ever-changing piece of grilled fish -- salmon, barramundi -- that's paired with those eat-every-morsel mashed potatoes and a few spears of asparagus. It's $15.95, and each iteration I encountered was just about perfect.

A little of incumbent Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic can go a long way. The fiery Democrat is famously abrasive, thin-skinned and combative.

He won't be mayor for life.

While that's a lot of money, it amounted to less than a quarter of a percent of the nation's gross domestic product, or GDP. Look at a GDP graph, in fact, and you can hardly see the blip caused by 9/11. The U.S. was in recession at the time, but 9/11 wasn't the cause. The Internet bubble had just burst, and the economy had been shrinking since the first quarter of 2001.

Fickell said the captains aren't likely to be announced before Tuesday, when the coach and players will hold their first news conferences for their Akron game week. . . . Remember this as Miami (Fla.) considers the eligibility of several starters related to NCAA allegations: that matchup Sept. 17 is Ohio State's third game of the season but only Miami's second game of the season. So, for instance, any two-game suspensions would be in effect against the Buckeyes.

Originally set in ancient Rome, the filmmakers have kept the city name but time-shifted ahead to a place that looks like any number of 21st century war-ravaged Eastern European countries (Serbia provided the shooting location).

IF PEOPLE TOOK a second to stop talking about the punt, if they thought about the most important development of the second half of the Eagles' season and not that one play at the end, most would say that it was the demonstration to Andy Reid and to everyone that Brian Westbrook can carry a big load at running back and that the offense works well when that happens.
The months-long case has been a test for the Obama administration and Egypt's ruling military council. The charges against the Americans highlighted Washington's waning influence in a region swept by uprisings and revolts that altered the traditional balance of power.

And that, putting it mildly, is bizarre.

There is still time for Kasich, who has not been directly involved in recent back-channel talks, to extend an olive branch to his political opponents. If a deal can be reached by the Aug. 30 deadline to withdraw Issue 2 from the ballot, Kasich can alter this state's image for the better. And if the governor asks, his adversaries will owe the voters whose support they seek a good-faith effort at compromise. So will his Republican allies in the General Assembly, who could render November's referendum moot anytime they wanted by passing a less incendiary substitute for SB 5.

Needless to say, it was tennis shoes from then on.

One course, for example, consisted of two soup dumplings filled with foie gras and arranged on a white riser so they look like a target, with concentric rings surrounding a small dish of dipping vinegar.

It was almost too much to take in with one bite, but fortunately there was another; even though we knew what to expect, it was just as exciting.

Again, I'm a dope. I'm also left-handed, which puts me at a dexterity disadvantage with center-console-mounted controllers. Can't be helped. But the Lexus system requires a daunting precision in one's control of the square, padded-leather joystick in order to navigate around the spacious screen display. The joystick, gimbaling at the front of the right armrest, is itself a marvel of engineering that uses magnetic torquing to create a snap-to-grid feel, electronic detents you can feel as the cursor connects with its target. This kind of haptic feedback is the product of years of biometric and ergonomic research, which has been, as I say, wasted.

It was all enough to keep the Blazers on the heels of the playoff-bound Clippers all night. In fact, at one point in the first half, the Blazers went on a 15-0 run and led 35-25. Then with 5:55 left in the fourth quarter, they took an 82-81 lead when Hickson dunked after receiving a pass from a driving Nicolas Batum. The lead swelled to 89-83 after Hickson administered another hard dunk and Raymond Felton made a three-pointer.

Henry Cavill, cast as Superman in Zack Snyder's "Man of Steel" next year, plays Theseus, a peasant who leads a rebellion against the wicked King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, the highlight of the film).

Around the time of menopause, many women complain of mental slippage. But, as if to inflict some perverse trick upon them, cognitive scientists have found that they actually perform no more poorly than women who do not have such complaints.

Those games hardened the Cardinals, and they promised they weren't simply happy to reach the Final Four. But they sure looked it early on, getting off to a slow, sloppy start.

It seems to me that the current administration won't be satisfied until the remaining wealth of this country is depleted. Don't think so?

Miller, on the other hand, leads more by example than with words. He often stays after practices to work his outside shot, setting up a mechanical ball return machine by himself.

Mills entered the season as a restricted free agent, however, meaning other NBA teams would have had to negotiate a trade with the Blazers for his rights. That didn't happen in the offseason, so Mills came to Portland clinging to the hope that the team might make a trade during the preseason to clear a spot. The clock is ticking on that slim hope.

Again, I am not faulting Ms. Jaquith. Perhaps she is the most logical choice but I would have been happier had the council said they are choosing to appoint her as opposed to having those interested in the position sending in their names. It was sounding like they were going to drop the names in a hat and pick one. Just appointing her would have been more honest. Seriously, it sounded like a prize drawing at a fair "just provide your name, address and phone number and drop it in the box, no purchase necessary. We will contact you if you have won." There was supposedly no need to enclose a resume but we could include one if we chose. Now, I read that council did have two "technicalities" to pass before being accepted by them: no conflict of interest for upcoming votes and no intent to seek re-election in November. Well, that could have been half the population of Pacifica had any of us chosen to enter our names. From what I read in the Tribune, it would appear that only eight others decided to enter, if that is an accurate account.

A neighbor heard the girls crying and told them where their parents were hiding. The Kanns knew they had to get out of France, and decided to risk the dangers of an escape.

In Indonesia, my wife, Daphne, and I had to learn a new language and assimilate a different culture. To my discomfort, I learned that payoffs were a normal cost of doing business there, from the bribe we paid to have a home telephone installed to the envelopes of cash to gain advantages in winning contracts. What an early lesson in inefficiency and immorality! Going forward, I chose to stay far away from these practices even though the "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act" had yet to be passed.
Marcus, the geography professor, said the awards are "an immense morale booster." His $6,000 award notification came just before he got a recruitment letter from another university. The letter went in the trash.

The dinner's proceeds support a good cause: scholarship assistance for Chicago-area students attending ND, a high-end-and-climbing university. (In fact, if you plan to enroll your toddler, start saving now.) It may be a sign of the times that the room was maybe two-thirds full for Brian Kelly; the Irish are coming off back-to-back 8-5 seasons and have won 10 games only twice in the last 10 years.
After Wilson's picture was broadcast by The Baltimore Sun and news organizations across the country, a reader from Chicago wrote in to suggest that Wilson and her cap were part of a political stunt designed to smear Mitt Romney, the GOP frontrunner for president.

The economy was humming along. Tax rates were low. So if health-care companies discovered creative billing policies — whether that meant asking three doctors to look at a patient who probably needed only one or two — nobody really seemed to care.

Traditional supermarkets, which were the dominant player just a couple of decades ago, now capture a little less than half of the grocery market, he said.
His backup? China’s lax labor, safety and environmental standards. It’s minuscule wages that make it attractive for manufacturers seeking cheap labor. It’s currency manipulation that keeps its export prices artificially low. All of these make it harder for American companies with a domestic workforce to compete, Brown says, yet make China attractive to companies that want to cut labor costs, especially for low-skilled hourly workers.

Ninemire enjoyed recalling one of the "little things" against UCLA on April 29 as being illustrative of her team. The Bears started the game in a 2-0 hole but when Reid stole home in the bottom of the first, it triggered three runs in what became a 10-3 victory for Cal.

Under the current system, billions of dollars worth of care is provided to people who cannot cover the full cost of their treatment, and those costs are passed on to everyone else. The insurance mandate would start to fix that problem by requiring people to demonstrate the financial wherewithal to afford the care they're bound to receive.

In Little League baseball, a sport where you see more than a few inside-the-park home runs, it's pretty special when a 12-year-old socks one over the fence. Saturday will be remembered as a very special day for the baseball fields at San Clemente's new Vista Hermosa Sports Park, which opened Feb. 25.

But professionally, who was he? What had the Orioles received from the Minnesota Twins in December 2010 when they acquired Hardy and his nearly $6 million contract for two minor league pitchers (Jim Hoey and Brett Jacobson)?
That's the crux of the story, of course -- the existential notion, set forth by the book with wondrous simplicity, that vast worlds, including ours, may be tiny to the vanishing point in the grand scheme of things. The problem, as with all Dr. Seuss books in the scheme of feature films, is that the story is small, albeit dense, and some of the padding in the script, by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, simply doesn't qualify as enchantment. (Nor does a frighteningly evil eagle named Vlad, or a glib reference, in a JFK voice, to putting "a speck on Mount Nool before the end of this decade.") When "Horton" sticks to the sweet, funny spirit of its source, though, all's right with the worlds, big and little.

The non-partisan Legislative Analyst examined the proposed contracts for public safety workers, engineers and scientists. The safety workers' deal would save less than 3 percent next year, the analysis said, while the two other contracts might save 6 percent.

The defense seems to be building on the way it ended last season, when USC shut out UCLA. The offense hasn't often resembled the unit that piled up 50 points on the Bruins. It didn't end spring playing championship-caliber ball. But Barkley is confident it will get there.

One thing Dolan learned: The Democratic Party was not for him. Democrats, he said, "protected and promoted a system instead of helping people." So he joined the GOP, which he said was a better fit for his anti-abortion, smaller-government beliefs. In 2004, it also was a better fit for Dolan's renewed political ambition in the largely Republican 98th House District.
Odierno initially defended his muscular strategy, but he decided on reflection that he was wrong and that a more sophisticated form of counterinsurgency aimed at winning Iraqis' trust and allegiance would have been a far better approach.
"I think it is really good for the current Gibault kids," Rueter said. "A lot of them help out at the camp and it shows them how difficult it is to coach. It teaches them patience, teaches them how to deal with the kids. Some of them may decide they want to be a coach or teacher, but most of them will have to deal with their own kids, so in that regard it is a good thing.

I believe moderation is a relative concept and I've coined a term for the way I look at food and diet: relative moderation. It means moderation relative to the person exercising it. Relative to the way you used to eat. Relative to your specific health challenges, your goals, your age and measurements, likes and dislikes, your level of willpower and the nature of your medical care and guidance.
Another part of the project is a generator. As part of the deal, the generator would serve both the tower and the municipal building. Since the township does not have a generator, the township offices were closed for a week after Hurricane Irene came through and knocked power out.

Starring Depp, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter, Chloë Grace Moretz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonny Lee Miller and Jackie Earle Haley, "Dark Shadows" opens, fittingly, in 1972, with the discovery of Barnabas' ironclad coffin in a construction pit outside Collinsport. Freed from his casket and chains, Barnabas promptly kills everyone in sight and makes his way back to Collinwood, where he reunites with the surprised caretaker Willie (Haley). In the original series, he had awakened the slumbering vampire Barnabas while looking for the family jewels beneath the mansion (all this gets revived in the remake).
That's probably because supplements are absorbed differently from whole foods, LeJeune says.
receiver was arguably the weakest position on Oregon's offense last year, which partly explains why Thomas became the team's top big play threat. Along with Huff, the pair gives UO speed on the perimeter. But with LaMichael James moving on to the NFL, Thomas could be called on to perform more running back duties. The position desperately needs an infusion of go-to playmakers. Hoffman, slowed by concussions in 2011, is a good downfield blocker (important in UO's run-based offense) but lacks the speed to frighten defenses. Vaughn showed flashes but never established himself as a top-flight receiver. He will have another chance this year, as will Hawkins and Dungy. The intrigue is in a host of young receivers. Blackmon and Sumler have speed to burn. They redshirted last year along with classmate, B.J. Kelley, a top-notch track performer. Oregon signed three wide receivers this year, but they won't be on campus until the fall. Lyerla, a five-star recruit in 2011, caught seven passes for 147 yards and five touchdowns as Paulson's backup and would appear to have the starting position locked down. However, the Ducks signed two four-star tight ends in February that will jump into the mix in August.
Many of the same folks who once lobbied for Greene now push for Matt Carpenter, who is not on the 40-man roster. Apparently those who observe Carpenter every day are less sure about him as a ready option than those who read about his exploits during spring

Last year was the first year I was able to officially bless animals, being a newly-ordained priest. Having all those different pets in one place brought back memories of other dogs who have graced my life, and the few cats I've owned, and some great and not-so-great days spent in dog parks. It was exceptionally touching to see parishioners I've known for years with their pets in tow. It reminded me of seeing friends just after they've become parents--even if they are nervous, or tired, or unsure, there is a new aura of lovingkindness about them, a certain permeability or vulnerability mixed with pride that never fails to stir up all my maternal and protective instincts. In other words, it was great.
James was fifth in the 100 meters outdoors in the Pacific-10 Conference Championships, and had a season's best time of 10.52 in the 100. James and Barner both were part of Oregon's 4x100 relay outdoors, which placed fourth in the Pac-10 meet.

Dungy spoke of the many men in his life who helped elevate him from a kid in working-class Jackson, Mich., to NFL player and coach, author and widely respected leader. He has spent much of his two years of retirement addressing the costs of fatherlessness, which he said could range from a lack of basic life skills to vulnerability to a fall into crime.
Now, some towns are appealing to the voters at a time when they have little appetite for higher taxes. The local votes create divides, sometimes between older residents and those with children. Signs supporting or opposing an override are kept in garages and stuck into front lawns each time a proposal comes up. Residents accuse each other of engaging in scare tactics.

After everything the Knicks have been through this year, it's sort of a surprise that their season is relying largely on Novak and Smith in addition to Anthony and Chandler.

Tonight—not Sunday—is this team's last chance to make this a competitive series.
