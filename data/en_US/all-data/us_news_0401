Gerald Herbert, APRon Paul won last year's CPAC presidential straw poll. Can he repeat next week?GOP auditions: No Republican has yet announced for president in 2012 and only one -- businessman Herman Cain, a very long shot -- has even set up a formal exploratory committee. But the noncampaign will be on in earnest next week at the annual Conservative Political Action Committee meeting in Washington. At least 12 Republicans with White House dreams will speak during the three-day pep rally/teach-in, which draws thousands of activists. Not yet scheduled: Mike Huckabee and Sarah Palin. One annual CPAC highlight is its presidential straw poll. Ron Paul won last year, followed by Mitt Romney, Palin and Tim Pawlenty. The first GOP debate is set for May 2 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. Maybe someone will be in the ring by then. Washington Post columnist David Broder, the dean of American political writers, says there's another early skirmish site to watch: The National Governors Association opens its winter meeting in Washington Feb. 26, with 29 GOP chief executives on hand. A clutch of current and former GOP governors are considering a run, but Broder says there's also buzz about an idea that used to be very common: Favorite-son candidates who run only in their home states and seek to hold their delegations until a consensus choice emerges, even at the convention itself. This could be wishful thinking -- political junkies salivate at the idea of a brokered convention -- but Broder predicts that Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour will put the idea before his colleagues this month.

Obama already has moved to eliminate a couple of special deals in the Senate bill that turned off voters when they became public, including extra Medicaid funding for Nebraska — derided by critics as the "Cornhusker kickback."

I have several retired friends that have moved to "tax friendlier" states because they could not afford to live in Maryland any longer. My own federal pension is being taxed over $4,000 per year in Maryland. Yet in several states, my pension would not be taxed, and why should it be?

“I think our confidence comes from us focusing on what we have to do best,” Liberty head coach Eric Mahlum said. “Nothing against St. Helens, they’re a good team, but we didn’t look at or scout what they did.

As a woman and a life long Roman Catholic, I would like to comment on the recent debate between U.S. bishops and the federal government on requiring birth control insurance coverage for employees of Catholic institutions.

By Wall's latest calculations, the preliminary number was too low instead of too high, but metro St. Louis still trailed the nation in job growth last year. A gain of 4,200 jobs would be growth of 0.3 percent, compared with 1.4 percent for the U.S. If he's correct that we'll eventually show a gain of 10,000 jobs, that's only 0.8 percent growth.

This romantic drama is the edgiest-ever film adaptation of the writings of Nicholas Sparks -- which isn't saying much. Beth (Taylor Schilling) is a willowy and gorgeous single mom running a kennel with her speaks-her-mind grandma (Blythe Danner). Logan (Zac Efron) is a brooding but chivalrous ex-soldier who tracks her down after finding a photo of her on a battlefield in Iraq. He charms her, but she's slow to warm to him. Director Scott Hicks lifts this material above previous Sparks-inspired movies ("Dear John," "The Last Song") by holding his revelations in reserve and producing a scene or two of real sexual heat. But at every turn, Sparks hurls obvious melodramatic obstacles in the way, telegraphs his story's every move and underlines every emotion. Rated PG-13; sexuality, violence. 1 hour, 41 minutes. By Roger Moore.

PGE is the ideal template, with much of the stadium built below street level to ease the movement of spectators, he said. The soccer renovation will give it a "sense of definition and enclosure," Crockett said.

Finishing dinner at Rome’s Ristorante da Fortunato, my friend Stefano explains that his greatest joy is an after-dinner drink called grappa. I try my best to enjoy the local firewater and fail. Sipping the grappa, Stefano instructs me: “You must not be in a hurry when taking a grappa!” He savors it carefully, sniffing the aroma and lingering over every taste. He then tells me that his ultimate joy is to have a glass of grappa — and a Tuscan cigar — while cruising on his sailboat to Corsica.

"Apollo" -- Jan. 13-Feb. 8, 2009, main stage. "The most adventurous production that we have ever produced," according to Coleman. Written and directed by Nancy Keystone, it's a multimedia epic about the U.S. space program, looking through the prism of Huntsville, Alabama -- where a community of transplanted scientists from Nazi Germany worked at the time of the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- and posing questions about costs, compromises and rewards in our race to the moon.

Outlook _ Record-setting QB Dalton Hewitt, the MCC Player of the Year in 2009, has moved on and is playing baseball at SEMO, leaving the keys to the Golden Griffins' high-scoring air attack to sophomore Brad Woodson. "Working the last four years with Dalton was an awful lot of fun,'' coach Gene Gladstone said. "But I really like what I've seen of Brad, too.'' The coach feels that Snyder (22 catches, 426 yards, 5 TDs) could emerge as one of the area's top wideouts. The Vianney ground game features Green, who combined for nearly 900 rushing-receiving yards and also picked off five passes last year. Green is joined by Gilmore LBs Andy Baker and Matt Guignon as defensive leaders for the Griffins.

5. If you missed seeing the movie "Buck" in theaters, you haven't yet seen one of the most emotionally affecting documentaries of the year. The good news is now you can, since it's recently out on DVD. The film tells the story of Buck Brannaman, who overcame an abusive childhood at the hands of his brutal father to become a real-life "horse whisperer." In the film, we see Brannaman's uncanny understanding of horses and the wisdom that gives him about humans, as well. It's deeply touching and unexpectedly inspiring without stooping to easy sentimentality. List price, $24.98; brannaman.com/bbdbpage.htm

When "Iron Man" clicked with audiences four summers ago, the reasons were both clear and refreshing: Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow, who returns here, had unusually potent comic chemistry, and although director Jon Favreau (one of the producers on "The Avengers") wasn't a genius at staging action, he knew how to establish a tone and stick to it.

Parks is certainly the better known of the two candidates and will likely collect more endorsements from L.A.'s aging black political establishment. He already has the fervid support of Rep. Maxine Waters, who has long resented Ridley-Thomas' efforts to build a political base independent of hers in South-Central. But with the help of the politically potent County Federation of Labor, which has already endorsed him, Ridley-Thomas is probably an even-money bet to win the seat. The outcome in the 2nd District race will not only shift the balance of power in county government, but it could also reveal whether business or labor has the allegiance of L.A.'s black community.

Dotted throughout the south stands in Sunday's 27-13 Broncos loss to the Indianapolis Colts was something old-timers say you never used to see: jerseys of the opposing team.

If anybody was brave enough to wear some, they often were made to regret it.

The Re-Theatre Instrument, a company mounting just its second production, started six weeks ago with a two-page outline that suggested how the themes of trust, loyalty, betrayal, political chaos and so on in Shakespeare's epochal tragedy could be re-purposed. Improvising around the framework of Shakespeare's original scenes, the cast and director Jason Zimbler created the script for "King Lear: The Rise and Fall of Baseball." The play imagines a time of purity and stability for the sport, and then the disintegration of its values when a benevolent despot cedes power to those who love themselves more than the game.
I met Andrew in the mid ’90s; he was working as a research assistant to Arianna Huffington, then on the Right.

That's a big change from 2009, when the company was struggling to survive after years of pilling up debt and building cars no one wanted.

And when you say you're considering private school again, is there even one in a rural area? (And, of course, private schools are not bully-free zones.)

Explain that the kids seem to be having trouble, and see what information you get back. Between giving your kids more time to get acclimated and taking a measure of the teachers, I think the answer you are looking for will become clear. — Margo, patiently

S. Dallas Dance is young. He will be just 31 when he takes the helm of Baltimore County's school system. And he has not stayed in any one place for long — a couple of years teaching, a couple as a principal, a couple each in administrative posts in Virginia and Texas.

His hiring in Baltimore County was announced less than 12 hours later, and at that point, he was already on a flight back to Houston. For Baltimore County parents unhappy about the way their schools have been run in recent years, that adds up to a heap of worry.

"I see no economic benefit with the city for having a stadium," said Grambsch, 64. "To me, it's a losing proposition. And it's also clear the Vikings aren't going anywhere. It's extortion, and I don't think we should put up with it."

øIf you stand at your window and look out you will see all sorts of people passing by, whether they are walking, running, jogging, biking or driving. Just because they are passing by doesn't mean you have to be available to them or invite them in. Set definite boundaries and stick to them. Stop being available to the borrowers, and ignore the gossipers. Usually we identify a betrayer because they have violated some confidence that we have shared with them. So, learn to keep people at a distance until you get to know them better.

It is one thing to campaign as an "outsider" and quite another to govern as one. Does the person have a track record of surrounding himself with professionals instead of friends? The difference was poignantly illustrated by George W. Bush's first chief of staff, Andrew Card, who, when he resigned his position, said, "I'm so glad I'm leaving the White House, because now I can be George's friend again." The president does not need friends in the White House; he needs "courageous followers," professionals who have the confidence to challenge a president when needed.

The shame of the other veto-worthy bill, a workers' compensation measure sponsored by Rep. Kevin Elmer, R-Nixa, is that there is a serious need for a good worker-protection bill.

Without this recommended allocation, the already taxed network of free foreclosure counselors and legal service attorneys will not be able to sustain the current level of service.

He moved to Seattle and got a job in a restaurant. It wasn't anything special, but it came with perks, like a tour of the Red Hook brewery, which was a step up from the Keystone Light his high-school friends had been fond of. There were tours of wineries available, like Chateau St. Michelle in nearby Woodinville. And the bar manager would let Bostock sample wines from the restaurant's wine list, which became a quick education.

The European "crisis" is back. Actually, it never went away -- and won't for many years. The problems are so deep and pervasive that there is no easy or obvious solution. Government debt and deficits in many countries are not sustainable, but the usual remedies of cutting spending and raising taxes -- aka "austerity" -- may make matters worse by deepening already severe recessions. Europe is caught in a trap that promises more political and social unrest.

After losing four states already (five, counting Missouri's non-binding primary), Romney can ill-afford more setbacks heading into Super Tuesday. Romney aides like to spin the fact that McCain lost 19 states last time, but GOP nominees in the modern era seldom lose more than roughly seven or eight, and it is worth noting that McCain failed to win the presidency.
Romney noted that Obama had visited National Gypsum Co. in February 2008. He did not mention, however, that the thrust of Obama's message that day was that he would take steps to keep jobs in America, in part by avoiding passing "unfair trade deals like NAFTA that put special interests over workers' interests."

Last Sunday, New Yorkers gathered in Times Square for the second annual Good Riddance Day, feeding reminders of the things they least liked about 2008 into an industrial-sized paper shredder. There's something so wonderfully archetypal about this ritual -- the only reason James George Frazer didn't mention it in “The Golden Bough” was that the ancient Celts didn't have giant shredders -- that we can't help but hope the tradition catches on. Heaven knows, there is a big pile of news from the previous year that we'd like to shred.

The production is stuffed with ideas, some better than others, and a harsh ending may irk some theatergoers (there were boos). But it was a relief, and very satisfying, to see such a smart, provocative and well-executed performance in the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College on Sunday.
"Survival of the fittest" is perhaps the most regrettable and misunderstood phrase in all of science. Absent from Darwin's work until the fifth edition of "On the Origin of Species," the phrase nonetheless has plagued Darwinism for more than a century and has been misused to justify social and economic hierarchy, unequal distribution of resources, imperialist conquest and now the suicide of our species.

2. When do you take 3-D scans? While a 3-D scan -- called a dental CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) -- shows terrific, cross-sectional images of your teeth and jaw, the radiation dose can be four to 67 times higher than conventional X-rays. Two major dental groups recommend CBCT only when regular X-rays won't provide enough information, such as before an implant. Experts disagree about it for planning orthodontia, so discuss it with your dentist.
Others are against the idea of the school board relinquishing 51 percent control of the fields to the township, which would be required for the sites to be declared open space.

Universal Pictures took the unusual step of releasing "Battleship" in international markets five weeks before its U.S. debut.

"The way he landed so awkwardly on his neck," said Cardinals TV play-by-play man Dan McLaughlin, reacting to a replay. "His neck was bent. It's not so much the cut on the forehead that you saw, but I'm sure they're very concerned about his neck area and his back."
Meanwhile, Romney is running a campaign so substance-free that his primary stump speech featured long chunks of reciting verses from "America the Beautiful," a scene of over-the-top emptiness straight out of a Christopher Buckley parody.
"That means you always have to be ready to protect your position in a campaign," he said. "One of the ways you do that is through money. The other is for volunteers. And we believe in saying thank you."
Yet as the campaign already has demonstrated, Congress has not done nearly enough to shine the light of disclosure on who is bankrolling efforts on behalf of particular candidates, including those sponsored by supposedly independent "super PACs." Disclosure is not a panacea for the distorting effects of special-interest money in election campaigns, but at least it allows voters to know who is writing the checks — and to speculate on what they might hope for in return.

“Maxwell’s is the first place I went to see bands when I was growing up, so it’s always exciting for us to play there,” said Greene. “It’s also where I think we sound the best. The Court Tavern (in New Brunswick) was always the place where we could play as loud as we wanted but shows there tended to get a little crazy. Now with the Court gone, you can’t play anywhere in New Brunswick. We were trying to set up a show with a friend’s band there and we couldn’t find anywhere to do it.”

"It must always be noted that these numbers are statistics-and complicated ones, based on tens of thousands of surveys from businesses and households, which are then massaged by a variety of quantitative techniques to produce the unemployment rate, the size of the labor force, and a host of other numbers. They are not absolutes, and they are not unequivocal facts. The definition of "unemployment" is not simply out of work; you can be without a job for years and not "unemployed" as a statistic; once you cease actively looking for work, you cease to be part of the workforce and hence are not "unemployed." "Employed" also says nothing about wages. You can have two jobs and still earn less than the official poverty rate or be unable to support a family of five, and that indeed is the case for tens of millions of people." - Primer by economist and money manager Zachary Karabell on how to interpret the federal government's monthly report on unemployment.

Save the best bubbly for streamlined cocktails that will show it off, such as the Classic Champagne Cocktail (see recipe). Once you start adding fruit juice, gin or other mixers, the subtleties of fine sparkling wine are lost and you may as well save some money with Prosecco or Cava. Both of these sparklers tend to be a little sweeter and fruitier than brut sparkling wine, but that's not likely to change the balance of the drink.

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office said total personal income tax collections would likely be more than $2 billion below Brown's expectation of $9.4 billion for the month. Because the state was already running behind, it would mean the take from income taxes would be $3 billion shy for the fiscal year that ends June 30 compared with Brown's updated January projections.
Nah. I mean, James is sensational and he could help the Broncos, no doubt. But he's 5-foot-8, 194 pounds and I think Fox wants both big and fast in his next running back. For speed, a better fit might be University of Miami's Lamar Miller or Cincinnati's Isaiah Pead. For size there is Baylor's Terrance Ganaway.

I planned to visit farms, talk to cultivators and eat oysters at breakfast, lunch and dinner even though it was May, a month spelled without an R, when customs tells people to avoid oysters. Almost 50% of Brittany oysters are consumed in France in December and January, during the Christmas and New Year's holidays.

Effective class warfare requires drawing a line and choosing a side. All this talk about millionaires effectively moves the line from income of $250,000 a year (the level below which Obama has promised not to raise taxes) to $1 million (the level below which you don't have to worry about the Buffett rule).

Today, it is available for rent, accommodating up to six guests.
