"Shaken baby syndrome" was cited Friday in the defense of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot teen Trayvon Martin. Hal Uhrig, a lawyer and former Gainesville, Fla., police officer who recently joined Zimmerman's defense team, explained that Zimmerman may have suffered injuries similar to shaken baby syndrome. Zimmerman has said he shot Martin in self-defense. THE BALTIMORE SUN

He also said he expected that the high school students brought in with the expansion will reap their own benefits from mentoring fellow students. "High school students (who get involved in mentoring) tend to benefit from greater involvement, develop needed life skills, and mature," he said.
This Team USA has pummeled the competition, and taunted, too, and mocked, and yeah, if we're being real, it's difficult to root for a team like that to walk away with the hardware. Which is why you've probably secretly rooted against your nation's men's basketball team in previous competition.
Years ago, friends Nura Maznavi and Ayesha Mattu were chatting over coffee at a cafe in Union Square. Topics of the day were life, love and happiness. And Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.

"Schizo," said one policeman. "Crazy," said another. "Public Square," said a third.
"It's a sprint, it is a boat race. You have to get off to quick starts. Generally if you get down early, 2 or 3 down, those -- you rarely come back. It's hard to make up ground when you're playing 18 holes. It puts such a premium on getting off to a good start, and the guys that do generally win the matches."

But if you float in conservative circles for any length of time, especially evangelical-based circles, the biggest complaint you hear about Romney is about his faith. Even Vice President Joe Biden recently defended Romney's Mormonism. "I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision," Biden told an audience at the University of Pittsburgh.
Income taxes are a potential third source of municipal revenue and are significant in places like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cleveland, but few cities in the West collect them.

One time I needed a deep, authoritative voice with a hint of gruffness, and the perfect choice was Dave Allen, the actor who had played the Popeye's Captain way back when. His career had moved on, of course, and by 1980 Dave was one of the most popular and respected voice guys in the region. I had never hired or auditioned him before that day, and I was a bit nervous and intimidated about our first professional encounter. Hey, the guy was a broadcast legend.

Another Ryan play in the third cost Noesi again when the shortstop went home to get Josh Hamilton in a close play at the plate with one out and runners on first and third. Hamilton was out on a close call, but a double play again would have got Noesi out of the inning unscathed.
øMares (24-0-1, 13 KOs), who recently vacated the IBF bantamweight title, fought for the first time at super bantamweight (actually a catch weight of 120 pounds) and seemed to give up neither speed nor power at the heavier weight than what he has been fighting at, 118 pounds.

The Raiders owned the town. Many players and coaches lived literally within a half-hour of the Oakland Coliseum, which further accounts for the strong feeling of abandonment. When Davis took the team, he also took friends and neighbors.
I had dinner the other night with John Madden at Harris' The San Francisco Steakhouse. He is a major fan of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
And Houstonians want to bike. One of the most dramatic changes seen in this year's Kinder Houston Area Survey was the sudden surge of Houstonians who want a less car-oriented lifestyle, with a majority saying they would rather live in a smaller home in a walkable neighborhood than a larger single-family home that required driving ("Mass transit threatens our love affair with automobiles," page A1, April 22).

Crank the standard height-adjustable driver's seat up, and the Juke offers a view of the road that's more akin to a crossover than a small car. The smallish cabin minimizes the distance between you and the windows, and the side mirrors are blessedly large. As bizarre as they look from the outside, the parking lights atop the hood clearly mark where the Juke's corners are; thick C-pillars, conversely, make over-the-shoulder visibility a problem.
Four decades later, we take it for granted, this idea of rock's commodification, but Willis is after something deeper: to call out, even celebrate, rock's contradictions, its inherent blend of commercialization and ecstasy. "You think it's funny," Joe Strummer sang in 1977, "turning rebellion into money." And yet for Willis, there's nothing funny about it, since what Strummer's getting at is rock 'n' roll's most fundamental tension: the quixotic desire to make revolution (cultural or otherwise) one product at a time.

A further US drawdown in Europe could prompt other NATO members to cut their own defense spending, with more nations relying on the EU-led (and US-absent) Common Security and Defense Policy structure.
Another likely factor in Schottenheimer's ouster was his decision to stand up to WR Santonio Holmes, who has been tagged as a problem in a locker room that turned sour this season. When Holmes began jogging through pass routes in a brazen display of non-hustle in the final regular-season game at Miami, Schottenheimer pulled him. The Jets can't cut Holmes because of his prohibitive contract, and the OC and the temperamental WR probably couldn't co-exist. So guess who had to go?
And Rep. Sara Lampe of Springfield is preparing for a run for lieutenant governor. It's widely expected that current Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a Republican, will run for governor in 2012, so that race could be wide open.

Drawing plays a visible part in Fouvry's address to a large canvas; but on paper, except at their most abstract, her marks turn crabbed and finicky. A page apparently lacks the open space her hand needs to outrun conscious intention.
The Oregon initiative was drafted after animal welfare groups were unsatisfied with a new state law that would transition chickens our of conventional cages into enriched colony cages by 2026, increasing each hen's personal space from 67 inches to 116 inches. The national proposal suggests 124 inches for smaller white birds and 144 inches for larger brown birds. Colony cages also allow birds the opportunity to express natural behaviors such as perching and scratching.

It could be good news for UC San Diego and its Div. I aspirations, too. Earlier this month students voted down a referendum 6,470 to 4,673 that would have doubled student athletic fees to fund a move from Div. II. But it was contingent on acceptance into a Div. I conference by 2014, and the Big West – the only viable option – had declined UCSD's previous overtures.

Delta's coach seats on 767s from MSP to Amsterdam have lacked in-seat personal entertainment, unlike Airbus flights. It can make a difference on an eight-hour flight.
President Barack Obama's statement that al-Awlaki "repeatedly called on individuals in the United States and around the globe to kill innocent men, women and children to advance a murderous agenda," didn't quite nail down the argument. Al-Awlaki could say what he wanted; what justified the U.S. drone attack was evidence that he'd been in direct contact with terrorists.
Today, while Jill waited in Miami, Joe Wilkins made the perilous journey to the orphanage in Fermate, a village in the mountains south of Port-au-Prince, in a rented, 5-seat truck powered by an engine that sounded like a lawnmower. From Petionville, the road leads up into the cool green mountains. No switchbacks ease the climb. The route eventually turns downward on a steeply sloped road.

During a calm market, a 400 point move would rank as the Dow's biggest in months. During this volatile week, it's the smallest. On Monday, The Dow plunged 634 points only to gain 429 points Tuesday and then sink 519 points Wednesday. If the Dow stays above 400 points through today's close, it would be the first time in its history that it had four-straight 400-point days.

“The process was a disgrace and it took a threat from the media to get them to move? It annoys me that they have no respect for the common man,” he said.
I enjoyed Paul Slavin's "The Perfect Storm" article. I could add a couple more contributors to our crisis: One is the fact that corporations weaseled their way into including themselves as beneficiaries of proposition 13. Because corporations are immortal if they choose to be, those corporations affected by Prop. 13 continue to be subsidized by the flesh-and-blood population. Another contribution to the "Perfect Storm" is our proximity to the ocean on one side and some very unstable hill on the other. Any business that draws a radius around any Pacifica location to count potential customers will not find as many as they would pretty much anywhere else.
Still, all is not perfect for landlords. The squishy overall recovery hasn't yet created the industry's main driver – an ample supply of new jobs. In Orange County, for example, unemployment runs near a two-year low, but the local economy still has loosely 170,000 fewer jobs than at the 2007 peak.
"How many of you saw your parents fill it out and mail it?" Democratic County Supervisor Rudy Molera shouted. "It's really important that it counts everybody . . . little people like yourselves."
China's total production capacity alone, at 36 gigawatts worth of cells, is more than double worldwide demand, said Johnson, the analyst. "This is quintessentially a commodity product," he said. Although American scientists are still at the forefront of emerging solar research, "when it comes to making traditional solar panels, the U.S has already lost the cost edge."

The fifth time came on that call she didn't like. Schiavone put a backhand into the net on the next point to make it 6-all. In the tiebreaker, two of Li's points came on volley winners, and one from a passing shot she hit that Schiavone volleyed into the net. The other four tiebreaker points ended with return or groundstroke miscues by the Italian.

Likening the L.A. regional plan's financing to the bullet train's simply isn't rational, and we're disappointed that Richard would make this argument. His command of transportation issues and, to some degree, his candor have won him admirers in the Legislature, where there's been bipartisan dismay over the rail authority's odd history of simultaneous disarray and happy talk.
As for automatically renewing leases, she said Chief doesn't give up a lease as long as there is a prospect of getting gas from it. "Holding leases, it's at the core of our business," Gittins said. "It's never any company's goal to lose a lease or let them expire."
In fact, I want to speak directly to America's seniors for a moment, because Medicare is another issue that's been subjected to demagoguery and distortion during the course of this debate.
The other big noise was "Terra Nova," a long-in-the-works adventure from executive producer Steven Spielberg and others. The set-up: it's 2149, and overpopulation has turned the world into a dying dystopia. What can be done? Take advantage of a time travel portal thingy and journey back to when dinosaurs roamed the earth, and set the reset button to start all over again with this civilization thing.

Union leaders, however, have been annoyed in the past by what they said was city indifference to their proposals.

Novice climbers need not apply: This is North America's tallest volcano (alt. 18,700 feet), known as Citlaltépetl ("Star") in Náhuatl. Its perfectly shaped cone encloses a 1,000-foot-deep crater, the product of repeated explosions in the 16th and 17th centuries. Luckily for alpinists, Pico de Orizaba has been quiet since 1687 and was made a national park in 1936.
"It has to do with job growth," she said. "It's a gold-rush mentality where the best and the brightest come to the Bay Area. The trend is for Gen Y folks, which is mostly what employers are hiring, and that particular generation has a preference for the urban core."
Completion of the so-called ARC tunnel, for Access to the Region’s Core, would have added room for 25,000 additional daily commuters, according to the Federal Transit Administration.

I recently moderated a press conference with scientists who are studying the effects of spring creep. Jake Weltzin, the executive director of the U.S.A. National Phenology Network and an ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, found that an earlier spring creates "mismatches" when some plants bud earlier and the animals that depend on them have not adjusted their internal clocks. For example, bees might fly to an area that provides habitat for plants they historically pollinate only to find those plants already have bloomed.

In Canada, according to the Canadian Veterinary Journal, from 1990-2007 pit bulls were responsible for one fatality while huskies and other "sled dogs" killed seven people. Perhaps it is because "sled dogs" are inherently dangerous and should be banned, or maybe there are just more of them in Canada. For the record I have a Husky and a pit bull mix, and both are wonderful loving dogs. I have no problem with taking responsibility for my dogs' actions, but my husky and pit bull should be held to the same standard.
"This is good for America, it’s good for New Jersey," U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said of the Senate bill. "It’s about putting people to work. It’s about getting people to work."
In a reckoning with tree swallows, the writer describes how “their liquid twitters, like paper clips being shaken in a little tumbler, define early spring just as much as clear light and bursting bud, periwinkle skies and high lazy clouds.”

Spellberg said the findings underscore the need for measures like the one taken Wednesday by the FDA. In 2010, the agency said that nearly 29 million pounds of antibiotic agents were fed to the nation's livestock each year. That practice accelerates bacteria's adaptation to the drugs, he said.
On the other hand, lion's head meatballs ($6.95) have more than enough pork. A fine dice of fresh water chestnuts punctuate three huge meatballs that are crusty on the outside, with a perfectly tender middle.

"Brave": Pixar and Disney tap the current fairy-tale craze with the story of a flame-haired Scottish princess skilled with a bow and arrow.

If elected, how would you balance the city budget? Specifically, what programs or services would you cut, what taxes or fees would you increase, and what other measures would you take?
The district should keep the college-prep curriculum but make it optional. At the same time, it should require certain basic academic subjects, particularly during the first years of high school, for all students and augment the last year or so with classes in practical areas such as computer science and auto mechanics.

That's it -- just three federal laws. A few states (among them California) have more laws, but these are often frustrated when people go to another state with fewer restrictions, such as Nevada. In most parts of the country, an individual can avoid a background check by buying from a "private seller" (often at a gun show), can buy an unlimited number of guns and can buy guns without either a license or a permit.

"At a minimum he is going to be a significant conservative voice on the national political landscape," conservative activist Ralph Reed said. "For a while, he was still kind of feeling his way to find the message that would click with the voters. You could see that he was trying out lines and he wasn't quite there yet. But before this is over, he may well be president or vice president, and that is pretty remarkable for a defeated former senator who thought his career was over."

Its location at the meeting of the Sacramento and American rivers was a boon and a curse: good for transportation and commerce, not so good for staying dry. Levees were built in the 1850s, but the flood in the winter of 1861-62 was a game changer.
For die-hards, who need a rally to believe concern exists, take heart. We still take to the streets.

--- Walter Cherepinsky, Walter Football: Mike Adams, OT, Ohio State. “Bryant McKinnie did a decent job at left tackle this year, but he'll be 33 in September, and with his skills eroding, he can't be counted on much longer. Despite a sub-par showing at the Combine, Mike Adams is arguably the top prospect on the board, so Baltimore could select him to be the long-term bookend tackle across from Michael Oher.”

Sugar is toxic, and possibly as addictive as cocaine. Meat is laced with antibiotics. “Pink slime” is unappetizing, as is its dubious and fishy counterpart, “pink slime of the sea.” And the plastic packaging that food comes in is just as worrisome. But never mind the evidence that, as a country, we are eating ourselves to death. It’s a free country, and we have the right to be our own worst enemy.
The church - and the underused University Hospitals satellite hospital, which partnered with Olivet nearly a decade ago - tend directly to the needs of an ailing city neighborhood, a community whose children number among Cleveland's poorest and least likely to get adequate healthcare.

WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's surprise visit Thursday to China yielded no immediate change in China's currency policy. But analysts predicted the Obama administration's efforts to mend frayed relations will result in a currency change, possibly within weeks.
It wasn't that the Broncos couldn't have used Tebow's skills. It's that Tebowmania is so oppressive, it can stunt the growth of even a player such as Manning from growing into the job as Denver's new franchise quarterback.

Stonhard offered to donate all labor and materials to upgrade the concrete floor that city officials described as "not particularly attractive, but functional."
Gray likes what he sees in coach Jerry Kill's offense. "It's a lot more spread, zone-read type offense," he said. "The quarterback is running a lot, so we have to be in great condition to do so. I see myself running the ball a lot, but if the time comes I'd like to stay in the pocket and stick to throwing. But if I have to run, then I'm going to run."

For politicians, the easiest thing would be to rattle a few sabers, hold hearings on birthright citizenship, direct more money at border enforcement and . . . go home without tackling the tough stuff. After all, they know from experience that pushing a complete solution will enrage a vocal segment of the population that thrives on making comprehensive immigration reform sound un-American.
Drake urged residents to report any fire activity in their area and, if possible, thin excess vegetation around their homes to reduce the threat to their property.
But I live here. I know and adore my neighbors (well, most of them). I have the sense not to walk down Washington Boulevard by myself in the dark while distractedly talking on a cell phone. But I feel very, very safe here. My neighbors notice when someone's car hasn't moved in a day or two, or when a smoke detector is going off. Some of the people I pass on the sidewalks probably are criminals or addicts, but they're still usually quite polite and will smile and say hello to me when I pass.

Does the fault lie with those who make the laws, rather than those who try to live with them? Couldn't we elect representatives who would tighten the tax code?

"During the first few days of therapy, I was exhausted," he said. "Every day the therapists pushed me to the limit - but they didn't shove. If you weren't feeling well, they would back off. When I didn't make my goal, they'd tell me, 'Don't feel badly, you'll make it next time.' My wife told me that every step I took was one step closer to my own front door, and, pretty soon, I wanted to walk farther every day. Now I'm doing three hours a day, six days a week, and I have so much more energy."

A: I think Curtis, as Jeff (Nichols, the writer and director) has written him, he's meant to be an Everyman. I don't think it's unusual nowadays for people, no matter what their class or their occupation or where they live, I don't think it's unusual for people to have questions or be uneasy about the state of the world. To me, it's a poetic version of what most people are dealing with on some level. Not everybody -- there are some people who are perfectly content and don't think there's anything wrong with anything. But I feel like a lot of people are dealing with some uneasiness and uncertainty.

The only sandwich issue I have at PQM is the "Better than a Gyro," which doesn't quite live up to its name. I'd take a fresh gyro from Greektown's Parthenon over this sandwich any day.

The little fellow looked as though he had lost his best friend, which was likely the case. I tried to get his attention. I whistled and waved and poked a slice of hot dog through the fence. No luck.

For sure, the style is here to stay. Some think it will become even more pervasive, given that climate change, with its rising temperatures, often is implicated in the spread of the style.

"He's probably one of the finest trombone players around, that's probably the first thing," Haydon said.

"We're not opposed to someone buying it and making lofts," said Tina Mode, who lives in the 2100 block of Delmar. She and her husband, Joe, gathered signatures from 75 residents who oppose the plan and live within a 300-foot radius of the property. "It's the elements surrounding it we're worried about."

UC Berkeley officials chose option three earlier this week, filing a lawsuit seeking an injunction to have more than a dozen protesters removed from the university's Gill Tract, a 10-acre research farm just off San Pablo Avenue in Albany.
Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace and Gromit cartoons, miss the boat with this animated outing. "Pirates" is stuffed with big-name voice actors (Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek, Brendan Gleeson, Imelda Stanton, Anton Yelchin and Jeremy Piven), but it's a movie that's entirely too late to the pirate party to offer much in the way of fresh gags. The plot centers on a lackluster pirate captain (Grant) who manages to capture Charles Darwin and who is then talked into setting sail for Britain by Darwin. Though it's amusing in small doses, this is the first Aardman film where the whimsy feels forced and the strain shows. Rated PG; mild action, rude humor, language. 1 hour, 28 minutes. By Roger Moore.
A spokeswoman for Howard's office said Thursday that the investigation is ongoing. She said she could not comment further on the investigation.
Inflation in March rose, with the Consumer Price Index up 3.6% compared with a year earlier, from 3.2% in February. But analysts expect prices to trend lower in the months ahead—giving the government more room for policy maneuvering.

The most vexing problem of all is the lack of cooperation from neighboring Pakistan. The Taliban moves easily back and forth across this porous border, launching attacks against American and allied forces and then retreating to sanctuaries in Pakistan. This is the situation in Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan. There, we visited an American military base that is carrying out dangerous raids on Taliban strongholds and weapons caches, with mixed success.

The dolphins' acrobatics are so well known here that crowds gather to watch. I joined a group last April, gazing spellbound with others on a veranda suspended over the sea. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was being welcomed to the French Polynesian atoll of Rangiroa by its most famous residents, a school of dolphins that lives in the pass that separates the atoll's lagoon from the Pacific Ocean. I had arrived at Rangiroa (pronounced Rain-GHEE-ro-ah) just a few hours earlier, flying northeast about an hour from Tahiti to the Tuamotu Archipelago, a string of nearly 100 coral atolls.
Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said the reason property taxes were kept in check is "not hard to figure out — we put a cap on. Caps do work. And this is stuff that I’ve been talking about since 2006. The positive is Democrats and Republicans alike driving taxes down."
That confusion resulted in a $79,000 insurance check to pay for a dome collapse in 2010 being deposited into the management group's account instead of the sports center's account. It's still not clear if all the money has been transferred to the sports center's account, according to city memos.

"The Democrats drew the short straw this election cycle; it's the worst anti-incumbent mood in years and there's nothing more divisive in this country right now than healthcare," Froehlich said. "Unless the Supreme Court finds the mandate unconstitutional in June, if the Republicans can take the White House - or even just the Senate - they'll throw out healthcare reform." This, he said, would at least lead to a healthcare sector boom.

The modest gains came one day after the Dow fell 140 points on credit-ratings firm Standard & Poor's decision to lower its outlook on the U.S. government's triple-A credit rating. Traders and investors said that many of those worries were being shrugged off a day later.
The Beavers had a bye for the first rotation, but the wait didn't serve them well as they struggled in the floor exercise. Kelsi Blalock lost points for stepping out of bounds and scored a 9.6, and Olivia Vivian fell off the corner of the floor while trying to stick a landing and scored only 9.175. As a result the Beavers totaled only 48.975 points and dug themselves a huge hole from which they were unable to escape.

A. The book wasn’t really about the “true facts” of London, but how people perceived the city. Smartie is like many of us who may embroider parts of their story. The fact that he’s touched on so many levels of British life was fascinating to me. He spoke well and had a great knowledge of many parts of the city. Instead of saying something hackneyed about soccer hooligans, Smartie was able to talk about hooligans and how fashion worked in other groups.

NEW YORK -- The oil rally is on again.
Two factors continue to confound the Blazers and Oden: One, before drafting him, there was no prior history of knee problems. The Blazers took images of both his knees before drafting him, and called the images "pristine." Second, every time Oden has rehabilitated from surgery, he suffers a setback at the same juncture -- when he begins running and jumping.

Sales have taken a beating along the way. For example, at Applebee's, one of the nation's largest midprice chains with more than 2,000 restaurants, sales at restaurants open at least 18 months slumped every quarter from mid-2008 through the middle of 2010. The chain's sales have grown modestly since then, compared with the low level of sales during the recession, but dipped again in the three months ending Sept. 30.

Federal assistance to individuals wasn't awarded to cover damage from the 2010 tornado in Wadena, Minn., which wiped out more than 200 homes and businesses. Nor was it authorized in the aftermath of heavy rains and floods last September that damaged an estimated 600 dwellings across about 150 miles of southern Minnesota, destroying all of the businesses in downtown Zumbro Falls. It was granted for damages from the 2009 Red River Valley floods and the 2007 flash floods in southeastern Minnesota, which killed eight people.

"I think to a certain degree, as you improve your talent level in certain positions and you improve your depth in certain positions, obviously it leads you to try to extend your roster," Mayhew said. "But we're still going to take the best player, we're not going to reach. That's what it's about. It's about not reaching for a particular position. We have a need or something that we perceive as a need, not going past five or six good players to get to a guy that plays that particular position."

But three weeks into the season many are coming to realize there was more to this draft than some had predicted. The Cavaliers' trip out West was evidence of that. In Utah, Enes Kanter has been one of the top rookie rebounders and Alec Burks has been quietly efficient in a limited role. In Phoenix, Markieff Morris is shaping up as one of the more astute picks at No. 13 with his blend of size and perimeter shooting.
McNabb led the Eagles to five NFC championship games in 11 seasons; no quarterback in that span went to more conference title contests. Then he was traded to the Redskins, and like many who come to Washington with high expectations, the system got the better of him.
“In this business, it’s hard to make everyone happy,’’ Miller said Monday night after he helped the Blazers beat Orlando 89-85. “You have to figure out when to distribute the ball, who to distribute it to, who’s hot, who to get going ... there’s a lot of stuff to do as a point guard and worry about yourself a little, too.

Dennis Leary was at the forefront of a trend when he opened this fine-dining diner in 2004. He'd just come off a stint at the now-closed Rubicon and wanted a place where he could control all aspects of the experience. He landed in a tiny space with stools (recently remodeled to add backs) along a counter and a few tables along the wall, lined with shelves of his favorite books. His menu - four appetizers, main courses and desserts - changes weekly, but might include polenta soup with rabbit confit; guinea hen with apple puree; sauerkraut and bacon; and gingerbread with caramelized pineapple.
Unfortunately, voters — and therefore the legislators who represent them — are unlikely to want to give the new revenue to the amorphous general fund or directly to the colleges to spend. Tuition reduction, by contrast, is a clear, tangible, readily understood benefit. The idea of bringing University of California tuition back down to a nostalgia-invoking $4,000 a year (instead of the current $12,000) is naturally appealing.

The impulse is laudable and on that point few would object. But the argument today isn't about whether to maintain a safety net; that was settled long ago. At issue is what to do about the reality that the government is promising grossly more than we can afford to deliver.

The United study attempts to dissect the city's study by challenging several of its assumptions, including what it considers "unrealistically low" fares on the new routes. Much buzz has surrounded the city study's finding that one-way fares to Bogota, Colombia, would decrease from $739 to $133, an amount that even proponents of the proposal have questioned. Although United concedes the average fare would decrease, its study says the city study overstates its own current fares and vastly understates the projected fares.
