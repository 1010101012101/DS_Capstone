The Sun should be commended for publishing such an extensive article on the "right to carry" laws in Maryland and putting it in clear terms that anyone can understand ("Gun laws' sketchy effect," March 11).

Autumne Franklin won Saturday's 100 hurdles with a time of 14.47 seconds. Set to compete at Harvard next year, Franklin earned All-Metro second-team honors last spring and then made the first team after this winter's indoor season.

The Spanish Basque paella ($23) was first-rate: loaded with flavor and overflowing with a very fresh assortment of prawns, clams, mussels and chorizo, all cooked amid the rice and held together with a delicious broth seasoned with red peppers and saffron. This was a hearty yet sophisticated take on a traditional Spanish dish that is not so easy to get right. The only thing I missed was the crispy, nearly burnt bottom of the rice, but that's not mandatory.

Mike Acker: Nic is a no-brainer. Keep him. This season Nicolas started to come into his own as an offensive player, which only ups his value. If he is going to be a steady feature off the bench next season he needs to develop a larger repertoire of perimeter moves and get a little more sure with his three-ball. That being said, Nicolas is a key to the franchise going forward, whether as a starter or as the sixth-man. Maybe the only scenario in which I would trade Nicolas Batum would be straight up for Dwight Howard.

The quick departure of Air Canada from John Wayne Airport comes after a long courting period between the airport and airline. Air Canada rose to the top of John Wayne Airport's waiting list in 2008. It was offered a chance in January 2009 to start service as early as the spring 2009. But the bad economy apparently slowed the move. Airline observers at the time said Air Canada most likely wanted to start service to western Canada to tap into interest in the Winter Olympics that began in Vancouver in February 2010.

Turner won't have as much time as White and his tiny band of believers did to build an insurgency. Depending on machinations at the Statehouse, Ohio's congressional primary could be as early as April.

Just minutes from the main street, I am transported to another world - 24 acres of spectacular mountaintop scenery. The views from every angle are intoxicating and seem to wash away worry in an instant. It may not be Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, but KTD's shrines and grounds are so reminiscent of it that Martin Scorsese filmed scenes here for his 1997 film Kundun, about the 14th Dalai Lama.
With only a few days to play, it's best to stay downtown, where many cool attractions - including the Beale Street partying corridor - are within walking distance, or a short drive or trolley ride.

As Occupy Wall Street enters its second month, let's look at what this group is advocating.

The novel "The Night Circus" (Doubleday: 387 pp., $26.95) is receiving a good deal of attention, and it's rightly deserved — even though some comparisons of Erin Morgenstern's fable to other popular books seem sky-high and unfair (to her).

The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled correctly last month that parking fees were being wrongly levied in many areas of America's national forests. A 2004 law is quite specific that it is impermissible to charge fees for parking or for "general use" of the forests. But while the court's ruling was perfectly in line with the law, the real problem is with the law itself. Under its provisions, if you use the bathroom while hiking in the forest, you can be charged, but not if you use nature itself as the bathroom. Picnicking on the ground has to be free under the law, but eating at a picnic table could, at least theoretically, cost you, as could using a trash can.

Randy Steven Kraft, likely California's most prolific serial killer, may have killed as many as 65 young men in Oregon, Michigan and California during a 13-year span. His killing spree came to an end when he was stopped on suspicion of drunk driving in 1981 with a dead Marine in his Toyota. He was a seemingly mild-mannered computer programmer with a high IQ who was convicted in trial of killing 16 men. But Deputy District Attorney Bryan Brown argued that a "score card" of his kills was found in the trunk of his car. It had 65 names on it. The 16 victims he was convicted of slaying: Edward Daniel Moore, Ronnie Gene Wiebe, Keith Crotwell, Mark Howard Hall, Scott Michael Hughes, Richard Allen Keith, Keith Arthur Klingbeil, Donnie Harold Crisel, Robert Wyatt Loggins Jr., Eric Herbert Church, Geoffrey Alan Nelson, Roger J.

"With the worst job creation record in modern history and the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, President Obama is trying to distract Americans from the real issues with a series of sideshows," said Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg.
By Time's telling, Obama clearly deserves enormous credit for the execution of the bin Laden hit. His measured approach to the exercise was key. There were a hundred ways things could go wrong, and waiting for just the right moment was crucial.

Pettitte is crucial to a government case that otherwise will rely heavily on the testimony of Brian McNamee, who worked as a strength coach for both Clemens and Pettitte and has said he injected both men with performance-enhancing substances. The government showed the jury photos of the three working out together in Texas during happier times — "Mac, Roger and me," as Pettitte put it.

Since passing the budget last June, Brown and Democratic legislative leaders have touted their work, saying they had slashed the $26 billion deficit left by Republican Gov.

For example, the ad running in Montana recalls Tester's votes for "government-run healthcare" then urges voters to "call Sen. Tester and tell him to stop supporting big government and start fighting for Montana's families." Crossroads GPS, the conservative group co-founded by Karl Rove, released an ad last week slamming Tester for supporting an Environmental Protection Agency regulation on farm dust. One Montana cable show pulled the ad, according the Associated Press, because the network determined that it was false; the regulation was actually never proposed, and the vote cited in the ad was a procedural measure. Tester is locked in a tight race with Republican Rep. Denny Rehberg.

Brooks, ironically, would find herself among the unlucky group of grieving survivors.

Carlisle improved to 11-3 as a coach with a chance to close out an opponent. ...

In addition to the immediate concerns regarding curriculum, testing and evaluations, Ms. Lowery at some point will also have to address the state's dysfunctional charter school regulations, which allow local school districts to summarily reject applications for opening new charter schools regardless of the quality of their programs or the desire of communities for alternatives to failing schools. The state board of education should have the authority to independently authorize charters when local school boards reject them for no other reason than that they don't want the competition. Moreover, Maryland's charter school law is virtually unique in requiring that teachers be hired by local school systems rather allowing such schools to hire their own staff. Ms. Lowery is going to have to lead the charge in the legislature for these reforms as well.
Enter Esi Edugyan's "Half-Blood Blues," a 2011 Man Booker Prize finalist making its stateside debut in paperback after first appearing in Europe and in Edugyan's native Canada. On the surface, with its colorful scenes of playing, drinking and bickering among a mixed-race ensemble called the Hot-Time Swingers, Edugyan's second novel could be a relatively conventional story of the jazz life. But she tweaks the formula by splitting the book's action between the chaos of 1939 Europe and modern times as old friends struggle to reconcile with a past that shaped them as men and as artists.
Still, that doesn't make the current system right, and it doesn't make the new way much better. Airlines have some of the most sophisticated reservations systems, particularly American Airlines, which has rolled out new technology called Direct Connect. If they're committed to transparency, then why can't they show us a price right now that includes everything?
After years of cuts, our military already runs lean — down to just 16 percent of federal spending (it was over 40 percent in the 1970s) with investment in research and upgraded equipment just a quarter of that. Our aerospace and defense manufacturing base is the envy of the world, but the supercommittee cuts would gut this industrial asset, putting more than a million Americans out of work and squandering intellectual firepower built up for decades.
Uphill from the plaza, along Calle Jacinto, the traffic washes away and the graceful colonial-era architecture coexists with jacaranda trees and bougainvillea. In the spring, their bright purple and red petals coat the sidewalks. Along the narrow streets, tiny plazas exist among the stately homes, with their large wooden doors and tiled accents. Among locals, the Plaza de los Arcángeles is known as one of the area's most serene nooks. Long stone benches are surrounded by greenery and stone arches. A tiny shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe is placed in the hole of a tree.

I've seen guys, first three, four games of a series not be very good, and then the last two or three, can carry your team."

The white sporting public (a.k.a. paying customers at the turnstiles) desperately wanted to be assured that there was a blond, blue-eyed kid who could out-run and out-hit these newcomers. The classic "Who's better, Mickey Mantle or Willie Mays?" argument was about more than baseball bragging rights. White America needed Mickey Mantle to be an idol, and the Yankees public relations machine, aided and abetted by a silent sporting media, delivered.

Jerry Brown trounced her, in part because he won 63 percent to 80 percent of the Latino vote, depending on which poll you view.
The streets of Union Square are packed this time of year, but harried shoppers can walk a few blocks up Bush to Claude Lane and find relief.

Jeff, Cindy, Pam and Mary Pat are what they call interpretive rangers. You won't see guns on their hips. The park has 37 interpretive rangers. That's about one for every 1,000 acres . . . and if you consider that only 16 of them are full time, well, the math works out to less than one for every 2,000 acres. Jared is a law-enforcement ranger, meaning he's a real-live cop. There are only 15 "permanent" (i.e., full-time) law-enforcement rangers; seven more work during the busy spring and summer months.

I can remember starting to drive faster because I knew I just needed to get to the office and find out more about what was happening. By the time I walked into our old newsroom on Hays Street, I think one of the World Trade Center towers had collapsed, and I soon watched the other one go down on our television. I could be wrong about this timing, but I do know I experienced something like what I just described with my own eyes and ears.
