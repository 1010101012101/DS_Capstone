The Patriots, who got here by winning their first game against a team that finished over .500 this season, will have an injured Rob Gronkowski out there. How much he'll be hampered by his injured ankle is a mystery, but it can be a big blow to the Patriots offense if he can't play to the level he has this season. One of the Patriots' advantages all season has been the play of their tight ends — Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez are statistically the most prolific tight end duo in NFL history.
The company asked for more time to reprogram computers because it is in the middle of installing new software.
Not so much with the incoming freshmen, but the transfer guys. I can’t tell you the number of kids we recruited in the past that really liked us, we really liked them, and they wanted to believe but they didn’t believe. And then when we play them, sure enough, these guys would come up after and say, ‘Coach, I should’ve listened, I should’ve come to you.’ It’s another validation for us. But as far as the transfer list, our list was ridiculously extensive. It’s the first time I’ve been involved in the selection process. The guys we have now are the guys we select – good fits, good players, good people, good students. It’s definitely an upgrade.

Think about it. Over the next ten years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. America has fallen to 9th in the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us – as citizens, and as parents – are willing to do what’s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.

To find that key, the new research looked again at the process that happens when oxygen in the brain is very low to see how it contributes to death of nerve cells. Researchers added new scientific tools to the study so they could see what might be happening at the level of molecules or even at the genes to help explain why adding extra oxygen during stroke did not always help.

These Nashville rockers filter heavy psychedelic rock through the reckless abandon of punk at times.

Unless Torre somehow returns to managing in the next two years, he becomes eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.

However, the event is primarily notable for what it represents: the arrival of craft beer in cans. The trend, generally credited to a fantastic Colorado brewery called Oskar Blues (unavailable in Illinois, unfortunately), has been spreading for years.

Goose Island will release 312 in cans on March 12 and now we have Sierra Nevada.

If you get stopped for being under the influence you're going to go to jail and it's going to be prosecuted. And I think it's been a fundamental change but it's been a good change for public safety, as difficult as it is for us to work through some of those problems.
The economists will argue about the fine points but the people know that something is profoundly wrong when 75 percent of government spending decisions are automatically decided by past formulas and not present lawmakers  formulas that ensure that government and its taxes always keep ahead of inflation.

I wasn't worried about leaving him alone for a few minutes because he's going through a "screaming phase," one of the more "enjoyable" phases of development where children are learning vocal control -- and therefore how to scream -- quite happily, ALL THE TIME. Luckily this is something they grow out of pretty quickly (or they never do and grow up to be lead singers in heavy metal bands). In other words, I could hear him very well at the other end of our house. And that is why, as I was finishing chopping up his apple, I suddenly froze. I couldn't hear the baby.

At Pompeii, I pore over my notes and maps. Finding toilets looked easy on paper, but the ancient city once had a population of 20,000, and is huge. Further complicating matters, some areas are closed for excavation. I look in corners, thinking maybe I'll discover a toilet everyone has overlooked.

Jennifer Hudson introduced Gwyneth Paltrow as country music's newest star. That's a stretch, but her plaintive performance of "Coming Home" was certainly sincere. Paltrow sings like a poor woman's version of Jenny Lewis: hers is L.A. country for sure. That said, "Coming Home" was penned by Nashville veterans. Hillary Lindsey, who has written with Taylor Swift and Lady Antebellum, is co-credited on the song. Lindsey has also penned or co-penned Carrie Underwood's best songs -- "Wasted" and "Jesus Take the Wheel" -- and "Coming Home" feels very much like an Underwood number.

Not long after his son was stabbed to death outside his apartment in Hampstead, Richard DeMario heard that police had arrested a suspect, and soon enough it seemed to him they had a strong case. The man had confessed in a video recording and left behind a trail of physical evidence, including a knife said to have been used in the killing and a shirt that prosecutors said was stained with the son's blood.
The pressure of living up to high expectations in the championship spotlight has derailed many a talented team, but St. Dominic didn't let that happen. Not that it was easy. After the final victory, Mennemeier told the Journal's Jim Faasen, "The last couple of days, I have tried to keep my emotions in check because the girls needed to stay grounded."
Every team had to deal with an abbreviated off-season because of last year's lockout. But that lack of familiarity was especially difficult for the Lions' linebackers with the additions of Durant and Stephen Tulloch and DeAndre Levy's move to the outside.

However, Seattle Times columnist Steve Kelley doesn't like the move. Kelley writes than a NBA team president told him Thomas is not ready. At 5-foot-9 -- his listed height; he's probably shorter -- Thomas doesn't have the blazing speed or dead-eye shooting to overcome his lack of height, Kelley adds.
We then started looking into who was moving to dismiss the taxi cases we reviewed. We discovered that city lawyers were behind a large number of those cases. When we asked them why so many cases were being dismissed they weren’t able to answer specifically and could only say that cases are dismissed for many reasons, including police officers and witnesses not showing up in court, not remembering the incident or, in some cases, plea deal arrangements.

The poll, conducted from April 16 to 18 among Hispanic likely voters in these states, asked voters the following question: "Arizona recently passed a law that requires state and local police to determine the immigration status of a person if there is a reasonable suspicion that he or she is an illegal immigrant. Mitt Romney has said Arizona's law provides a model for the nation on immigration. Does Romney's stance make you more or less likely to vote for him this fall, or does it not make a difference?"

"Catherine the Great" by Robert Massie (574 pages, Random House, $35) is a logical successor to Massie's biography of Peter the Great, as the author seems to be working his way through the Romanov rulers of Russia, not all of whom were so great. In Catherine's case, the transformation of a nervous, relatively poor German girl into a confident, imperious empress was the marvel of the 18th century.

14. Charl Schwartzel, South Africa -- Schwartzel finally will resurface on the PGA Tour until next week in the Players Championship, having last played in the U.S. since the Masters, although he did finish solo sixth in the Maybank Malaysian Open the week after the first major of the year. It's a long season for the South African, who the last two years has opened the season at home on the Sunshine Tour in January before coming to the U.S. to play on the PGA Tour. Then he finishes the season in the European Tour's Race to Dubai. Charl took this same break at home with his family after winning the Masters last year and playing in Malaysia. ... Schwartzel's finish in Malaysia was his best since he tied for fifth in the Honda Classic and then tied for fourth the following week in the WGC-Cadillac Championship. It seemed his game was coming around nicely for the defense of his title at Augusta, but he tied for 50th after missing the cut in the Transitions Championship and the Shell Houston Open. ... Schwartzel finished fourth in the Race to Dubai last year and doesn't have much work to do there to stay in contention, given that he ranks 10th in the standings. However, he needs to pick up the pace on the PGA Tour. He is 67th in the FedEx Cup standings after finishing 21st in the regular-season standings a year ago to qualify for the PGA Tour playoffs. However, without the burden of being the reigning Masters champion and coming back refreshed, he might be ready for a big second half of the season.
Which leads to the third step in this process. If we're going to get any of this done, we're going to need a movement. For 20 years, environmentalists have operated on the notion that we'd get action if we simply had scientists explain to politicians and chief executives that our current ways are unsustainable. That turns out, quite conclusively, not to work. We need to be able to explain to them that continuing in their current ways will end something they actually care about: their careers. And because we'll never have the cash to compete with Exxon, we better work in the currencies we can muster: bodies, spirit, passion.

Longtime readers of this blog know the rules. We do this every spring. The winner of Survivor: Jupiter is the player who appears in the most consecutive games during Grapefruit League play. One appearance in the field, one at-bat at the plate or even one turn pinch-running can extend a streak. A player who does not play in Game 1 is eliminated before he gets his cleats on. Last year's winner proved later to have an important cameo in the September playoff run: Adron Chambers. The young outfielder outlasted Mark Hamilton and Jon Jay to win Survivor: Jupiter 2011. The contest took to the middle of the schedule before a winner was crowned.

Hazing cases in marching bands have cropped up over the years, particularly at historically black colleges, where a spot in the marching band is coveted and the bands are revered almost as much as the sports teams. In 2008, two first-year French horn players in Southern University's marching band had to be hospitalized after a beating. A year later, 20 members of Jackson State University's band were suspended after being accused of hazing.

Jawan Jamison finished the season strong last year so we know what he can do. What many want to see is if the heralded recruit is ready for a breakout second campaign. I felt Huggins was a victim of coming from too good of a high school program. He’d have big holes, burst through them and then use his natural ability in space. At this level, you will be hit early and you will be hit often. A year of getting used to the game here should have Huggins ready to go. Look for Savon to run with a lower pad level, and more decisiveness at the point of contact. If he is, then Rutgers may have a two-headed monster at the running back position.

Once I sit, or I should say, as I'm crammed, into the tin of anchovies that is the cafe seating, I wait, and wait, and wait. My long-limbed friend gets leg cramps from a stool that sits too high for the dining table.

But the music is also challenging for its unusual structure, a huge Allegro flanked by slower movements; its shifting moods and textures, which range from lush romanticism to almost-Mozart clarity; and the abundance of its musical ideas. Kalmar and the orchestra lent acutely responsive playing in a tightly integrated performance that sounded exceptionally well rehearsed that few on stage were around the last time the OSO played it, nearly 20 years ago.

Pitching: Fresh from a demotion out of major-league camp, lanky sinkerballer Brandon Dickson tossed three perfect innings he did have a strikeout. ... Reliever Adam Reifer, who is distancing himself from last year's unlucky knee injury with every pitch, had a line of 1.1 IP, 3 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 3 Ks. Reifer reminds be of an interesting question that the Cardinals will face this season in Class AAA Memphis -- who is the closer. There's Victor Marte, the incumbent, and then a handful of young pitchers who could be there aching for that chance. It's possible to see all sorts of permutations for the ninth inning in Triple-A Memphis, with Eduardo Sanchez, Adam Ottavino, Reifer and perhaps a few others getting a look there depending on how the major-league bullpen sorts out. Sanchez, of course, could be in St. Louis just as easily as he could be in the ninth in Memphis. ... Ramon Ulacio had a line 0.2 IP, 2 H, 1 ER, 4 BB, 1 K. ... Stalyn Lopez followed with 1 IP, 6 H, 3 ER, and Jean Mijares had a simple scoreless 1 IP, 1 BB.

A General Motors plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., located along the Hudson River less than an hour from New York City, sits idle 15 years after the automaker shut it down.

"He was very forthright about seeking and supporting earmarks when he was governor of Massachusetts," Santorum reportedly said Wednesday at an event in Oklahoma.

You are right about one thing, Lee. In bypassing Hillary Clinton, Obama opened the door for McCain to shake up a losing race by choosing a woman as his running mate. But McCain chose the wrong woman.

Both men reported the incidents to their superiors.
"The Ides of March," based on Beau Willimon's play "Farragut North," which had a run at the Geffen Playhouse in 2009 in a production starring Chris Pine and Chris Noth, is directed by George Clooney, who collaborated on the screenplay with Willimon and Grant Heslov. This insider drama about political operatives waging war on the campaign trail is given a darkly elegant makeover that's snappily paced and, with one crucial exception, convincingly acted. (Ryan Gosling takes on the role assayed by Pine of the boy-genius press secretary, and though Gosling is one of the finest film actors working today, his emotionally heavy reticence isn't an especially good fit for a quick-draw spinmeister.)

Even if the Broncos' hot pursuit of Peyton Manning proves to be futile, the organization's actions in the past several days tell us all we need to know. Executive vice president of football operations John Elway and his fellow powerbrokers aren't stressed about the psyche of their current starting quarterback, and that's a cold, hard fact that even the relentlessly positive Tebow will have a hard time overcoming. One way or the other, I don't see Tebow being The Man in Denver. And while I love Elway and certainly understand his desperate desire to see Manning in a Broncos uniform, I think the kid is getting the shaft."

The law would require people suffering from a serious mental illness but who have refused treatment to be evaluated by a licensed counselor. The counselor would advise a judge whether the person “in the foreseeable future” is a risk to himself or others and needs in-patient care, or whether outpatient care would suffice. If a person ordered to attend outpatient counseling does not comply, a judge can order an evaluation for commitment to a hospital.
