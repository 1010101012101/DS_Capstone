Voice acting requires training and the luxury to do lots of unpaid auditions. Once you and your coach are confident in your skills, you make a strong demo. This is a competitive industry, and it's crucial in voice acting to show range. It's not enough that you have a great voice; you need to do more with it. Be prepared to be creative and spontaneous when necessary in the studio as well because sometimes clients aren't sure what they want until they hear you read their script. Los Angeles is the obvious choice for voice acting work, but even here in the Bay Area, I'm very busy with video game, commercials and corporate work.

Margalis reveals that the city will offer “a grace period” to those who wish to avoid fines, though all accrued taxes will still be due.

It’s complicated. Some 683 people have died below the rims (thus "in" Grand Canyon) during the known history of Grand Canyon after the early 1860s. Since the canyon became a national park in 1919, the number is 653 people -- but not all of them died in the park, because the canyon extends well beyond the park boundaries to the Navajo, Havasupai and Hualapai Indian reservations and Lake Mead Recreational Area. (We did not tally deaths on the rims unless they were air crashes or homicides.)

While applauding the recommendations on Xanadu, Sarlo rejects the conclusion the Meadowlands and horse racing cannot be saved, although he contends racing cannot survive without casino revenues. He supports gaming in the Meadowlands, but that is a fight he would be unlikely to win against Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester), who can unilaterally kill any bill in the Legislature. The entire South Jersey legislative contingent opposes any gaming licenses outside of Atlantic City, which remains an economic engine for the region despite its growing losses.

But a disturbing trend began in 1950, when St. Louis County created its park department: Wealthy people, under misguided notions of philanthropy, began giving away land to be used as parks.

But he also won because the county's black leaders mounted a poor showing for the candidate they preferred. With the potential that top county offices could become vacant this year, black county residents have every right to wonder whether their leaders have learned from the experience, or whether they'll be outmaneuvered in the next intra-party battle, too.
that comes to where you work and offers a variety of bakery-fresh cupcakes, at least one type of cake and some brownies? You say, "Give me some." Sarah's salty caramel cupcake is quickly becoming famous around town, and an orange Dreamsicle variety was delicious. Only one downside: A cupcake is $3. This makes me feel like John Travolta in "Pulp Fiction," wondering if a malt is worth $5.

"I probably put more pressure on myself than anybody else," Taylor said. "I felt I had to be good for our team to win, and in most cases that was correct. Being the guy who played a lot of minutes and being a senior, I had to lead by example. So, I tried to do everything right this year. I tried to stay out of trouble off the court and be an extension of coach on the court. I think I did a pretty good job."

Huckins says he's answered this question a number of times since the fliers went up for "Planet of Dinosaurs," the sci-fi movie and concert production he orchestrated in June. Huckins' jazz quintet, the Blue Cranes, performed an original score for the '70s answer to "Jurassic Park" as it played at the Hollywood Theatre. Voice-over actors relayed the film's dialogue and a prop team provided roars and crashes, all live, onstage and from the pit of the theater.

As county attorney in 1994 and 1995, he set in place a legacy of following the letter of the law — a process about which Lake had never been overly particular before his arrival.

"I don't care what anybody says, it's a strain when you deal with your family and you deal with people outside of it," Coyotes captain Shane Doan said. "And if you're going to lose a series 4-0, it's a perfect example that we're answering questions about what's going to happen next. You don't even get to think about the year. You have to think about what's going on next. That's the part that bugs you because you've only got so many years to play in this league and you want to enjoy them."

But as an elected official, the district attorney is a politician too, and any effort he or she makes to crack down on government misconduct — or to let it be — is at least to some degree a political act. To ensure that prosecutions do not become persecutions, voters must probe deeply into the candidates' actions and attitudes. Are they threatening to prosecute politicians because they are truly concerned about municipal corruption, or are they simply pandering to voters and perhaps hoping to use their power to push political rivals out of the way? It's not always easy to tell the difference.

What no one will likely be marveling at is the six-speed manual transmission. It's a Tremec TR6060, which is used in other high-powered cars like the Chevy Corvette ZR1, and it's not known for the smoothest or lightest of shifts. It's often used in these applications because it can handle all that power, but automakers like Nissan, with its GT-R, have foregone the manual transmission altogether to make their cars even faster.

Origen's fate, however, should be determined less by the restaurant's somewhat isolated location and more by the relationships that Clayton and life partner Trace Leighton cultivate.

Forever Marilyn, which recreates the famous moment from the 1955 movie "The Seven Year Itch" in which a New York subway grate blows the sex symbol's skirt up, has been one of the city's most discussed, most debated and most gawked-at works of public art.

I was with the Navy Ship Salvage Unit Foxy 29. I landed on Omaha Beach at the end of June 1944 on the LST-291 with a cargo of tanks for the Army. Our mission was to clear the heavily mined ports of Cherbourg and Le Havre of ships and cranes that the Germans had sunk to impede our supply ships. Although the Germans mined a number of these sunken ships, we located the wreckage by trolling the harbors with a long bar and dredge, similar to those used on commercial fishing boats. Luckily, we accomplished our missions with only minor mishaps.

Charyn Canyon is in the northern Tien Shan mountain range about 120 miles from the town of Almaty. A weekend trip or a stopover on a drive toward the Chinese border, this canyon is popular for hiking and rafting. Multicolored gorges reminiscent of Arizona landscapes surround the Charyn River and extend for more than 50 miles. One part is known as Dolina Zomkov, or Valley of the Castles, for its unusual rock formations. This canyon carved by wind, sun and water has been called the "Younger Brother of the Grand Canyon." For a closer look at this canyon, see Edward J. Fern's Reader Report on Page 9.

The death of Thomas Kinkade, whose paintings of cottages and churches in empty woods were among the most popular mass-marketed images in America at the turn of the 21st century, was less a loss for art than it was for real estate. Though never accepted by the high culture art world, Kinkade’s vision of pastel-colored buildings (he rarely painted people) with glowing windows and cozy porches proved enormously popular with lots of folks who, for the most part, hate high art. In many ways, Kinkade, who was born in California and died there April 6 at the age of 54, was as much a marketer as a painter. He sold his work through franchise galleries he controlled throughout the country and reproduced his hand-painted pictures as mass-produced prints on canvas, often with textures and hand-applied highlights (executed by employees) that suggested an actual painting.

Of course it's insane paying a wide receiver that much money. It's a position wholly dependent upon the quality of the quarterback pitching him the ball. Megatron's megahaul pretty much ensures that he will spend the remainder of his career in Detroit as probably no worse than the second- or third-highest-paid player on the team.

There's a revealing moment here, too. With all the speculation about the steering of Seastrunk's recruitment, and the tired debate over who might have influenced his decisions, this move to transfer feels like it was all Seastrunk. Far as we can tell, no money changed hands. Nobody worked around the wishes of key family members. Nobody pulled him close and whispered that they had a dream that foreshadowed his decision.

And at the precise moment you may have asked yourself a question — “Can the day get any worse for the Knicks? — that’s when Iman Shumpert turned east and his left knee went west, and he crumpled to the floor in agony, his screams audible 20 rows above the court. Shumpert, who will be out six to eight months after suffering a tear of his left ACL, was only the Knicks’ best hope to muffle and mute Dwyane Wade in this series, and as their best pure athlete was one of the few who could maintain the Heat’s exhausting and exacting pace.

Thursday at the Garden, the Knicks will be without three of their five starters — Stoudemire, Jeremy Lin and Iman Shumpert, who will have left knee surgery Wednesday.

The Knicks were 14-5 when Stoudemire didn’t play.

I prefer to scatter it over the top and let it melt into the filling.

-- In perhaps the most controversial of Steinberg's proposals, legislators could put an initiative - including a tax increase - on the ballot by majority vote. The danger of such a provision is that it might only encourage legislators to deflect more tough decisions to the electorate. But, in a phone interview last week, Steinberg said his intention was to give the majority party a chance to appeal to voters on the one decision it cannot make itself: to increase taxes, which requires a two-thirds vote. Last year, Republicans balked at even allowing voters to decide on a package of tax increases, forcing Gov. Jerry Brown to go through the initiative process.

There were moments when Paris could have used an editor to delete the superfluous ingredients from some plates. Two excellent medallions of Broken Arrow Ranch venison caught my attention with pureed parsnip and huckleberry-kissed demiglace — but skidded out of control with the overly sweet carrot custard on one side, and a chestnut-flour crepe stuffed with jarringly ripe Camembert on the other. I also would have loved the “purloo” unconditionally, its rice soaked in spicy tasso cream and jeweled with sweet scallop, shrimp, and perfectly poached oysters. But he should have stopped before plunking a glob of cheap neon-red and black fish roe on top.

Bill is now singing to his sweetheart and reunited with his family in heaven in the presence of Jesus. Bill accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior at an early age. It is a great comfort to know that he is safe in the arms of Jesus and that we will spend eternity with him.

When I was growing up, there were two or three theories in competition with each other.

Among them are the Toyota RAV4 and 4Runner, the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, Nissan Xterra and the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon (which come in versions with two rows of seats). A full-size spare is standard on all those models, but on the RAV4 you lose the spare when you buy the optional Sport Appearance Package.

Obama hasn't helped, Nixon said, and the mere mention of Romney drew an audible snort. "I don't really see a difference," Nixon said. So he's not putting a lot of stock in the candidates. He'll vote - probably for Romney, otherwise, what right does he have to complain? - but his main focus is completing a master's degree in education this summer.

Bill went with the can't-miss prime rib, 14 ounces for $25, which was still reasonable, though we had the same prime rib at The Distillery in midtown for half the price.

Q: I'm desperately seeking a recipe that was featured in a small article a few years back. The article was about plums, which were in season at the time. It recommended several ways to enjoy them, one of which was a salad. I believe it included goat cheese and nuts (either pecans or walnuts).
However, some people see me as a red flag and they are the bull. They just have to charge and keep charging. They feel they must tell me why I am so very wrong! I say that I prefer not to debate the issue, and I try to change the subject, but it doesn't always work.

Ryan Yuengel of Festus and Mizzou did, too. Brendon Neel (Festus/Jefferson College) and Tommy Branham (Festus/Southeastern Illinois College) also batted fourth. And before any of those four, all members of state championship teams, there was Zak Shy (Herculaneum/Jefferson College), whose bat powered the 2005 legion state champs.

Park next to Johnsondale Bridge and climb down the yellow staircase that leads to a four-mile trail along the upper Kern where the really serious anglers pursue wild trout. At places, the path narrows, bounds over rocks and climbs over downed trees. On the trail, don't expect bathrooms or running water, but you'll find countless brilliant fishing spots, many in the shade of willows and oaks. About a mile north of the bridge, I found a giant granite outcropping that juts into the river like a stone dagger. I sat on the dagger's point, my feet hanging over the edge and cast baited line into a swirling pool of emerald green. Time stands still in places like this. I might have fished from that stone dagger for an hour or five minutes. I can't recall.

That is precisely the problem with the Big Three U.S. automakers. They have been bleeding cash for many months -- $6 billion collectively per month for the last quarter. In plans submitted Tuesday to Congress, General Motors claimed that it will be unable to continue operating if it doesn't have access to $4 billion by the end of this month. Overall, it seeks an $18-billion "loan." Chrysler says it will need access to $7 billion as soon as possible. Ford, the company in the least precarious state, says it won't necessarily need to tap into its requested $9-billion line of credit unless conditions worsen.

Danger court: The NCAA has been holding Final Fours in domes since 1997, but this is just the fourth season of the setup that elevates the court in the middle of the dome, which was first trotted out in Detroit in 2009. The setup in New Orleans may be the best yet in terms of creating a basketball atmosphere in a dome and not having the upper deck look like it's in the next county.

Messi's third of the night at a festive Nou Camp showcased his dazzling skills as he raced clear on to Andres Iniesta's pass, dinked the ball over the onrushing Carlos Kameni and tapped the ball into the empty net.
That's not good enough. This re­covery is too anemic, and the chance of an economic stall far too high. Even now, polls show, Mitt Romney's empty "I'll do it better" refrain is attracting as many voters as Obama's "We're on the right track." And if the economy stalls, Romney's empty promise will look even better. And I'd put the odds of a stall at 50-50.
The cramped quarters at Station 2, built in 1975, forces the firefighters to pull down bunks and sleep in the engine bay. The proposed station would offer four bunk rooms, including a room for a battalion chief, a workout room, kitchen, larger engine bay, more storage space for turnout gear and a stainless steel decontamination room. If firefighters from Station 2 get blood on them, now they have to go to another station for decontamination.
"While the president acknowledged last week that Arizonans are justifiably fed up with inaction, filing a lawsuit is counterproductive to his statements of appealing to the American people's highest ideals to create a sensible and workable immigration policy. Arizonans are tired of the grandstanding. Political posturing on this issue has to end."
Kiedis was in a talkative mood, and in an unexpected turn, he made a foray into an arena at least as rough as rock and roll -- Newark politics. The frontman told the crowd that New Jersey's biggest city was "looking good" and "smelling good," and he tipped his cap to Corey Booker.
A. Not really. They complain about everything. Actually, their complaints kind of legitimized the movie. Frankly, I think the complaints are irrelevant because I've never seen any proof anywhere that Internet complaints have any impact on how a movie does at the box office. Look at all the outrage over "Spider-Man."

School Board member Paul Morris said Tuesday that the board believes Spiegel will no longer ask the district to provide his family's health insurance if he gets a full-time job elsewhere.
Brownback argues that slashing income taxes is the road to more jobs and a more prosperous state. Moderate Republicans say that supply side economics was discredited during Ronald Reagan’s time. They also point out that schools are vastly underfunded and insist that conservatives have provided no evidence that they’ll boost school funding even if state revenues grow.
First, the fortified rules are readable and understandable. They boil down and incorporate all default Ohio ethics statutes, so that a seeker after rules needs look in only one place. The proposal adds to that law new and unequivocal county prohibitions: 1) against nepotism and patronage; 2) against conflicting secondary employment; 3) against conflicting interests in board appointments; 4) against political contributions to elected employers; and 5) against improprieties in the filing of ethics complaints.

Minneapolis officials want at least a $30 million slice of the Metrodome's value, a move that would significantly cut into the money being counted on to help build a new Vikings stadium in Arden Hills.
"I saw something odd happen, and was wondering if you'd ever seen this," he wrote. "The player to my right had an 11, and the dealer had a 5. The player said, ‘Double for less,' only the stack he pushed out was bigger than his bet. He put it right next to his bet, and the dealer didn't seem to notice. To be honest, she'd been acting pretty bored all along, moaning about when her break was coming, and I don't think she was noticing much of anything. When he said he was doubling for less, I guess she was expecting to see two different stacks, and it never dawned on her that the bigger stack came last.

The death of the complex known as Pruitt-Igoe was seized on by any number of groups as validation of their viewpoints. Enemies of modern architecture said the soullessness of the design caused the problem. (Minoru Yamasaki, who went on to design the World Trade Center towers in New York, was the architect.) Conservatives said it demonstrated that government-sponsored housing inevitably collapses, or muttered that this was further proof that the poor were their own worst enemies, beyond the reach of state assistance of any kind.
To have a character offhandedly refer to other Nazis looking for occult relics in the desert is appropriate and fun; Johnston did effects on “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” To steal a major scene from that film for an ending, though, isn’t an homage; it’s like showing your hostess how much you liked her party by pilfering a teaspoon.

The only provision in place contractually is that if the Blues reach the Stanley Cup Finals all those games would air on KMOX.
Some of these specimens started as fragments of broken or damaged reefs just offshore; many have doubled and tripled in size since the aquarium opened in 1998. Luecke notes that site biologists will reintroduce most of the coral into the wild at some point in the future.

"He says," Young said, "'We trick kids because they think they're just going to play a game and we teach them how to think.'"
Indeed, the sense of this year's program is that governments, including ours, are falling behind non-state actors in driving the world, whether those non-state actors be terrorists, or individuals networking together with computers, or the World Wide Web itself, which can be used to rally movements in ways that states find hard to thwart or duplicate. A whole series of panels will look at technology and society and how networking is driving change.

Ms. Fleisher worked on thorny cases. She argued that an insurance company discriminated on issues of gender. She also fought for four women who filed a claim against the Maryland Transit Administration, alleging that they were denied employment because they were overweight. She also litigated against a car dealer who was advertising new vehicles for sale that had been previously rented.
When Ryan Braun batted directly in front of Fielder in Milwaukee last season, he received two intentional walks all season. Braun -- like Cabrera, a right-handed hitter -- hit 33 homers for the season, batted .332 and won the National League MVP. Yet opposing managers almost never had him walked intentionally in order to pitch to Fielder -- even when they had lefty relievers available to face the lefty-swinging Fielder.

Even more disturbing were the stories told by several Geauga residents from other streets, also speaking at the trustees meeting, who had suffered similar treatment when their streets got on County Engineer Phillips’ list of streets to be “improved.” Horror tales of ruthless cutting of large, old trees were made even worse by the cavalier treatment given homeowners who questioned the county’s plan.

Sharks: Many, many hockey analysts swooned when the Sharks acquired Brent Burns over the summer and picked San Jose to come out of the West. Lot of nail-biting going on this past week, as the Sharks were in danger of missing the playoffs entirely up until a few nights ago. They're the team that ousted Detroit the last two years in the playoffs, in the second round. So would they be the worst possible opponent? Well, they won three of the four meetings, the last one in overtime. They've got a power play that ranks 2nd in the NHL at 21%. They key for the Wings will be if they can get their power play to work, which, yes, why should anyone believe that will happen in the playoffs when it hasn't been the case all season?

The most recent example of this involves Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System. In 2002, PERS closed the records of retirement benefits paid to public employees. The Oregonian protested and then-Attorney General Hardy Myers ruled in favor of PERS. After John Kroger became attorney general, The Oregonian and Statesman-Journal of Salem both asked that the ruling be reversed. Kroger agreed the records should be public. PERS then took the unusual step of fighting the advice of the state's top lawyer and hiring an outside attorney at public expense. PERS sued both papers in an attempt to keep the records private. Eventually, the sides settled, as reported in the paper last month, and records will soon be released to The Oregonian and Statesman-Journal.

While I was putting this column together, it made me think about how many common expressions in our language are based on terminology or strategy from card games: Your strong suit. An ace. Play the hand you've been dealt. A wild card. Don't tip your hand. Deal me in. Play your cards right. In spades (referring to the highest-ranking suit). The phrase "grand slam" originated with the game of bridge. As strange as it may seem, it's very possible that if you ask younger Americans to define "trump," they'd just say it's that obnoxious rich New York guy who fires people on TV.
A. The trip that really sparked my interest in seeing the world was my first trip out of the country. In ninth grade, I went with a friend's family on a cruise to France, Italy and Greece, also spending a few days in Rome. I fell in love with Europe, especially the romance and history of Italy, and I adored the excitement of discovering new places and people and learning things you can only experience from firsthand travel. From then on, I was hooked.
Calculator in hand, I studied 11 other FireSky packages for that date, with a dizzying array of options. I decided the gas package was well-priced, saving me about $30 over a breakfast-and-room package.

Neither reservations nor the restaurant could give me a dollar value for the breakfast in the gas package.

The large Caesar salad with grilled chicken ($7.75) has beautifully diced romaine lettuce tossed with fat handfuls of grated parmesan, perfectly toasted croutons and a carefully sliced piece of chicken breast. But the romaine is drowned in a creamy dressing, the chicken is cooked past juicy, the croutons are more crunch than flavorful, and the wonderfully salty anchovies one expects in a Caesar have been replaced by acerbic lemon slices, leaving this salad with nothing to balance its one-note flavor of powerfully assertive garlic.

Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) -- the characters are named for "Superbad" screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg -- are lifelong boon companions and state-of-the-art nerds who are about to graduate from high school and go their separate ways. The skinny, gentle and socially inept Evan, who has worn a deep groove in the straight and narrow, is headed for Dartmouth; the economy-sized, potty-mouthed Seth is headed for oblivion. An unexpected invitation to a party at the house of cool girl Jules (Emma Stone) gets Seth and Evan fantasizing -- maybe they'll get drunk, maybe they'll get lucky -- and sets off a chain of events that tests their alcohol tolerance and their relationship.
