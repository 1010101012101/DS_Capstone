The city must have the $50 million in its accounts by mid-November in order to guarantee a balanced budget for this year — and avoid a potential takeover by the state. City officials Tuesday said there was no room for error or delay.
Prices are already easing at U.S. gas stations. The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded fell to $3.907 on Thursday, down nearly 3 cents from a week ago, according to AAA. Prices generally climb in the spring in anticipation of more driving during warm weather, but this year the climb started earlier—mid-December—because of concerns over Iranian oil supplies and the closing of a number of money-losing East Coast refineries.

Much will depend on whether 28-year-old William and 29-year-old Kate can summon the things every couple needs: patience, love, wit and wisdom. But they face the twin burdens of fame and scrutiny. Money, power, beauty -- it can all go wrong if not carefully nurtured.
But private enterprise wasn't the only sector upended by the economy.
Those unwanted pounds motivated me to set a goal to get back in shape. Deciding that achieving the weight on my driver's license might be raising the bar a little too high, I opted for returning the extra five. Who couldn't accomplish that?

Groupon provides tips on its coupons aimed at reminding people to tip on the full amount, not the discounted one, "and tip generously. That's why we are the coolest customers out there."
As much as any of her songs, Ain't No Way is a shining example of the spectacle that is Aretha Franklin's voice, which conveys an extraordinary range of emotions for more than four minutes. She begins in a state of simmering resignation and slowly ignites into a visceral and naked expression of defiance, exasperation and despair. It's a spine-tingling display of power and elegance, as operatic as much as anything.
Weider's film doesn't paint technology as evil, but something innately human. Without technology, he notes, he couldn't have made his documentary and he and his wife couldn't have given birth to triplets through in vitro fertilization.

Morris left Gahanna this year to become superintendent at Clark-Shawnee. He replaces Debbie Finkes, who was paid $95,188 a year. Morris signed a three-year contract paying him $110,000 annually.
Look in the headlines today for other examples of teams counting on their own first-round picks for production. Stephen Strasburg (1st overall) makes his return today to the Washington Nationals from Tommy John surgery. Justin Upton (1st overall) has been a key part of Arizona's shocking run to the NL West lead. The absence of Buster Posey (5th overall) has been a key reason why San Francisco was vulnerable in the NL West. Just this past weekend, the Cardinals got an eyeful of Yonder Alonso (7th overall), the Cincinnati Reds' prospect who is playing left field just to get his bat in the lineup.
Godbee said the department has about 240 reserve officers, but the goal is to recruit 200-250 more.
But that personality has also surfaced on the court since Mills entered the rotation.

Andy Dirks had a single, double and drove in three runs in his first two at-bats, helping give Verlander (3-1) a 5-0 lead.
The enigma that is Jay Gatsby has been one of the reasons there has never been a satisfactory screen adaptation of Fitzgerald's 1925 masterpiece: The impenetrable murkiness of Gatsby's character handily defies cinematic shorthand. But, like Draper, Gatsby's elusiveness is much more than a literary convenience. Fitzgerald, the Midwesterner who went East to reinvent himself, saw both sides of the American "dream." On the one hand, ours has always been a culture of hope and aspiration. On the other, our abiding belief in change and the ability to reinvent ourselves can bring us perilously close to the edge of self-delusion.
Ford is being held in lieu of $100,000 bail.
The bill allows state colleges and universities the option of setting lower rates for students who don't qualify for in-state tuition because they moved away before graduation.

Rod didn't really want a bunch of billionaires to pony up cash to fund a nonprofit group in exchange for appointing Valerie Jarrett to the Senate seat. He was just talking about it. And the fact that he stopped talking about the scheme after Jarrett withdrew her name means nothing. He just has attention deficit disorder or something. He quickly moved along, and so should we. There's really nothing to see here.

Who would have thought Pat Casey and his guys would be sitting in first place when we're 2/3 of the way through the season? Not many people, that's for sure. Though from the beginning, players and coaches said they were going to be better than everyone was giving them credit for. A few weeks ago in the dugout, Andrew Susac smiled and said, "I told you so! I told you before our first game we were going to be good. Now do you believe me?"
As usual, the telephone rang at a bad time, when I was crawling around the floor trying to find a missing thumb drive.

Right now, the Beavers are 3 ½ games behind the Ducks in the standings. Oregon has just one conference series (at home against USC) before the Civil War; OSU has two (at Utah and at Washington State).

If you’re looking for Jagger wearing his Rolling Stone colors that’s easiest to hear on the song “Never Gonna Change” co-written with Stewart. It has the same country rock ballad vibe as “Wild Horses.” The current single from the record “Miracle Worker” is a gritty reggae piece, but even better is the bright ’n’ breezy reggae of “Beautiful People” that places Stone in lead vocal position with Jagger and Marley testing their upper registers with backup.

Actually, that our state has to step up its game in regard to preschool isn't a new concern. The Illinois Facilities Fund has earmarked $45 million toward the building of new preschool facilities, according to the independent newsmagazine Catalyst Chicago.

"Leap of Faith," the musical version of the 1992 film in which Steve Martin played a crooked evangelist who has a crisis of faithlessness, is as slick as ice on Teflon. To be sure, Raúl Esparza, the hardworking star, is smooth in the wrong way—he comes across like a talk-show host, not a sequin-spangled faith healer—and none of the other members of the immensely likable cast give the impression of having traveled much farther west than Chelsea. But if you're looking for pure Broadway razzmatazz, "Leap of Faith" delivers the goods. Robin Wagner's set turns the interior of the St. James Theatre into a revival tent, and Christopher Ashley and Sergio Trujillo, the director and choreographer, put every square inch of it to effective use. The chorus rocks and rolls. The gospel-style songs, by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater, are rousingly lively (though the ballads, as usual with Mr. Menken, sound like '70s sitcom themes).

Perhaps China's loss of poise is temporary. Perhaps its leaders are playing to nationalist galleries at home because socialism no longer stirs popular emotions. (But that is a dangerous game; they may be hard-pressed to de-escalate future crises of a more serious nature.) Who knows?

You can snorkel alongside sea lions and turtles — you don't even need a snorkel to spot multitudes of colorful fish — or, if you like, reel in some prize catches.

Springsteen took a risk coming to South By Southwest this year. What did a classic rocker have to say to the newest generation of music aficionados anyway? Perhaps he knew that those aficionados have been raised on albums by Arcade Fire, the Hold Steady, Okkervil River, and other alternative rock bands who owe as much to the Boss as the Boss owes to Eric Burdon and Woody Guthrie. Tonight they proudly displayed their familiarity with Springsteen's entire discography, singing along to material old and new, shouting for new saxophonist Jake Clemons and cheering the memory of his uncle Clarence, and falling to a reverent hush during the ballads and acoustic breakdowns. The release of "Wrecking Ball" turned the middle of the floor into something not too far from a mosh pit.
A: Of course, I can't give away any punch lines, but I will be talking about a lot of backstage stuff, things I'm not supposed to say. Like the process of being nominated for a Grammy -- and losing, by the way. Getting to see all the celebrities, going to parties. Not that I'll be revealing anyone's -- how shall I say -- indignities, but my thoughts about my encounters with these celebrities.
A. "Leadership is important because your employees have to know what you stand for.

We don't have the jerk in the locker room you have to stay away from or worry about. Guys genuinely like each other.

But I see them. Brown, or black like me. Some scarred like me. Scared like me - once a ghetto child. Hardening - hearts half calcified - by life lived under the constant shadow of death, where chaos is the score that too often resounds between each breath.

"The idea that (Buchholz) can improve is absolutely paramount in all of our minds," Valentine said. "The pitches that he's featuring should be correlating to better numbers. Not a lot of the other arms in the league are featuring the pitches he's featuring. There's no doubt that he has plenty of room for improvement. I'm not sure that he's totally comfortable with all of his pitches yet. We just had a talk about what's going on, and it was the most relaxed that I've seen him all year, the most natural, so I think that's a good sign."

Which is not to say "Luck" is without its share of thrilling moments and stunning performances. They're in there, to be sure, if you're willing to wade through all the stilted and uninvolving stuff. It also should be pointed out that the deeper you go with this series, the better it gets.

Most vacancies arise from the predictable event of a judge taking senior status or retiring between the ages of 65 and 70. Under senior status, the judge continues to work, often at a reduced work rate, and the president may nominate someone to fill the vacancy. We are encouraged to give advance notice of our intention to retire or take senior status so that the replacement process can begin. If a judge gives one year's notice of his or her intention to retire or take senior status, the president and the Senate should commit to fill that vacancy within a year, or 16 months at the outside. The same timetable should apply if the vacancy arises in some other manner, such as death, disability or elevation to a higher court. I suggest something like seven to nine months for the president to make a nomination, three to five months for the Senate Judiciary Committee to give the nominee a hearing and an up or down vote, and two months for the full Senate to give an up or down vote on any nominee who clears the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mulbah and two other neighbors, whom he doesn't know, tightly gripped the comforter to break Surina's fall, he said.
Ostracized by the mean kids of the swashbuckling world, these misfits literally fall into the study of a depressed Darwin (David Tennant), who recognizes Pirate Captain's parrot as the last surviving dodo bird. This leads to a scientists' competition in London, which is only slightly less deadly than that of the pirates. It also puts them in the path of Her Majesty (Imelda Staunton), who has her own interest in the captain's pet.

Hynoski. Not only did he stone Spikes for much of the game, he pounced on Nicks’ fumble in the third quarter. What was most impressive was where he was when Nicks caught the ball -- at the line of scrimmage after getting a piece of LB Jerod Mayo, whom he thought might be blitzing. Good hustle by Mayo to get to Nicks, but great hustle by Hynoski to be in position to recover the fumble. Too many times you’ll see a guy quit on the play. He didn’t, and he’s to be lauded for that.
Today, for the first time since April 24, the Nuggets practiced at Pepsi Center. After a week away (and a film session Wednesday), the Nuggets regrouped in preparation for Game 3 on Friday.

Were "Call Your Girlfriend" to be re-recorded by a male singer (as it surely will be, if it hasn’t already), it would be a very powerful message sent to a man grappling with his sexuality. That was probably on Robyn’s mind when she wrote it, and possibly when she sings it, too. She keeps her voice heavy with ambivalence and concern; she’d like you to believe that she’s telling this story from hard experience, and that she’s been on the losing end of these dance-floor negotiations.

“I heard the song, and it was just a tremendous, tremendous horror of a tune,” he tells Popeater.com at the VH1 Save the Music Gala. “I noticed a few similarities in the melody, but it wasn’t enough to pick up the phone and argue with somebody about it. If anything, I just wanted my $1.29 back that I spent on iTunes.”
Readers meet Perkus through the eyes of a narrator, the guileless Chase Insteadman, a former child television star still trading on vapid adolescent charisma.

In the end, maybe the rash of misfortune and injury coming out of camp is a good thing for ASU football. Remember how some players openly spoke of winning it all? Maybe this lowers the volume and expectations just enough to keep this team from suffocating.
Despite the skepticism, after re-reading the draft-guide scouting reports on McClellin, I felt a regret similar to when I look back at the form to see what I missed in the winning horse I failed to consider, let alone put $2 on. Without having seen McClellin even in shorts as a Bear, I'll say this: McClellin is closer to Brian Urlacher than he is to Dan Bazuin. His versatility, size and athleticism make him a better candidate to succeed somewhere on the Bears' defense. When Bazuin failed at defensive end he had nowhere to go. McClellin has options.
And following a whole fall on the edge, including a surge from 10 1/2 games down in the wild-card race, Tony La Russa's team didn't dare mess with Texas, or any more drama in baseball's first World Series Game 7 since the Angels beat Giants in 2002.
Obama administration officials have been trying to choose between this Colorado rule and a legally-buttressed national rule, which bans most roads on 4.4 million of the 14.5 million acres of national forest in Colorado.

CHN officials say their building -- a $12 million development that relies on state tax credits -- will meet a need in Midtown.

The contract would mark a substantial boost for the aircraft, orders for which lag behind those for the rival Airbus A320neo. The order by Air Lease, created in 2010 by industry veteran Steven Udvar-Házy, highlights the growing importance of aircraft lessors, which are expected to account for more than half of the sales of both models.
And just in time. After serving as a councilman in Florissant for 32 years, Schneider ran for mayor of and won last year, beating five opponents. Whereas he used to play about 27 holes a week, his increased workload as mayor means that Schneider feels lucky to work in nine holes every other week. But he hoped that his golf adventure could inspire others to follow his lead.

A rockabilly musical set in the 1950s, this breezy show is a little like "Grease," which New Line staged a few years ago in characteristically raw style. "Cry-Baby" is even cruder, but it still tells the story of a good girl, Allison (the delightful New Line regular Taylor Pietz), and a bad boy, Cry-Baby. (Welcome newcomer Ryan Foizey, a tall, lean and rough-around-the-edges actor, fits right in to director Scott Miller's offbeat troupe.)

In Los Angeles, where it seems every architecturally significant modernist house has been documented, studied, photographed and published several times over, the 1958 Pasinetti residence has proved to be that rare surprise: a little known midcentury gem that intrigues visitors not just because of the design, but also because of the man who built it -- not Neutra, not Schindler, not Ain, but Georgescu.

"The contract has always said the city has the right to amend or repeal the ordinance, with no conditions," said Paul Griesemer, a partner at the Thompson Coburn law firm.

"I think ‘organized chaos' would be a better term," Hitchcock said. "This is why the players play. This is what happens when you have a lot of young players in the league. It's very emotional, and it's very intense. It is chaos, but it's still organized.

Spinach: Its powerful ingredients include magnesium, a nutrient most of us don't get enough of. The trouble with that? Makes you feel wimpy, because your muscles (not to mention your heart and intestines) need it to function properly. Your brain loves this green, too: People who eat three or more servings per day (1 cup raw leafy spinach , 1/2 cup chopped raw, or 1/2 cup cooked) of the stuff slow mental decline due to aging by as much as 40 percent. Other leafy greens that help here: kale and collards.

And "Smash" is artistically ambitious, presenting an array of characters that range from plucky and talented to likable and talented to kind-of-a-jerk-but-talented. But it's on NBC, not HBO, Showtime or Starz. In other words, the network is gambling that viewers who don't pay extra for premium cable are -- gasp! -- intelligent enough to want to watch something that's not utterly formulaic, or so familiar you can practically recite the dialogue along with the characters.

Trickier still is the question of how a widow with a skimpy acting résumé and a son who seemed groomed for a career in politics can be qualified to pass the torch to a new theatrical generation.

Steven Rosso, a St. Paul collections attorney, said in many cases the only information creditors have is an outdated credit file.

In the statement, Wallace says the capital plan is a "key component" of this year's budget, and encourages community members to attend the meeting to share their thoughts on the plan and budget.

Finally, technology is a key and confounding factor in men's home and work lives. While it appears responsible for allowing men to get more accomplished in their work lives while keeping up with homefront needs, it has clearly blurred the boundaries between the two, with a resulting increase in tension. In 2002--the first year the Families and Work Institute asked the question--32% of men said they were contacted by people at work at least once a week outside of their normal working hours. By 2008, 41% were.

For the first eight months or so, Anderson worked on what Duquette calls an "ad hoc basis" and didn't get paid by the Orioles or the players.

The flaw in the McCain plan, then, is not your central complaint, Dan -- that government is doing something at all -- but rather the plan's specifics. In fact, many of your critiques can be addressed -- McCain could narrow the scope to only owner-occupied primary homes, which would cut out speculators who bought five condos. The plan should also require borrowers who receive assistance to give back something in return. In exchange for a fixed-rate mortgage on terms the individual can afford today, any future increase in property value should be shared with the taxpayers at sale or refinancing (a proposal my colleague Andrew Jakabovics and I outlined early this year).

RAMS RUN OFFENSE VS RAVENS RUN DEFENSE: Whether Steven Jackson plays or not — and he's expected to be a game-time decision — it's hard to foresee the Rams' getting too much going on the ground. The Ravens have shut down the Pittsburgh Steelers' Rashard Mendenhall and the Titans' Chris Johnson, allowing an average of 70 rushing yards, the fourth-lowest total in the NFL. They've also had a top-five rushing defense for five straight seasons. Jackson, who is dealing with a quadriceps injury, rushed for a 47-yard touchdown on the Rams' first offensive play of the season. Since, St. Louis' running game has accrued 166 yards on 44 carries. Cadillac Williams and Jerious Norwood would carry the load if Jackson were out. Williams had 91 yards on 19 carries Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles, but wasn't a factor Monday against the New York Giants. Ravens inside linebacker Ray Lewis, second on the team with 15 tackles, has averaged 13.5 tackles in four career games versus the Rams.
