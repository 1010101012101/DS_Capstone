erratic for two seasons in a row, but help is on the way with an infusion of freshman talent and one of those players is Gavin Andrews. “Great athlete for his size. Great drive blocker. Moves really well,’’ says Cooper. “Gavin could have gone pretty much anywhere he wanted, but he really liked the atmosphere at Oregon State.’’ The Beavers liked what they saw, too. Andrews, also a standout heavyweight wrestler at Granite Bay, has the footspeed, the strength, and the athleticism that could translate well in the Pac-12. … also has the mean streak that OSU offensive line coach Mike Cavanaugh likes. “He goes total Jekyl and Hyde’’ on the football field, says Cooper, who also coached former OSU and current NFL wide receiver Sammie Stroughter at Granite Bay. … “Sammie put in a few good words,’’ said Cooper. … the physically imposing Andrews said OSU wants him to trim down to about 305 pounds, but maintain his strength even as he attacks his steamed broccoli and carrots. Andrews played strongside tackle at Granite Bay (and some defensive tackle his senior year) but may start out at guard for the Beavers, a position he hasn’t played since eighth grade. … Andrews ended his prep career with a flourish, playing a tremendous game on both sides of the ball in Granite Bay’s 30-24 upset of Pleasant Grove in the San Joaquin Section Division I championship game. In that game, Andrews clearly won his individual battle with highly-regarded defensive line prospect Arik Armstead.

"Moonrise Kingdom": People don't see Wes Anderson films because they wonder what will happen in the narrative, but because they want to spend time in an odd place inhabited by eccentric people invented by a creative genius. The "Rushmore" director brings his eternally youthful pessimism to his latest work, a search for two 12-year-old runaways on a New England island in the summer of '65. Anderson regulars Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman are present and accounted for, while Bruce Willis and Edward Norton are new to the party. (June 22)

Loyola player who must be locked down: OSU coach Thad Matta said Loyola's Robert Olson can stretch a defense with his quick release and ability to get off shots. Olson has made 65 3-pointers this season, 13 more than any Buckeyes player, and is shooting 44 percent on 3s, 5 percentage points higher than any Buckeye. OSU has defended the perimeter well lately and must continue that.
It wasn't always ideal -- his living room would be full of recording equipment sometimes -- but it was working out. Then he and Veirs had a little boy, Tennessee. Working at home became a little more difficult. And then, as Tennessee got bigger and louder, a little more difficult.

Other directors built on it. Anthony Mann’s westerns — “Winchester ‘73,” “The Naked Spur” and “Bend of the River,” among them — turned the white-hatted hero into something grayer. These were men — like the war-hardened Stewart, like his adult fans — who had seen things they didn’t want to remember and maybe done things they didn’t want to do. And they carried that with them.

After stirring controversy with his comments Monday, Romney was silent on the auto rescue in his Tuesday speech at Lansing Community College, his first return to Michigan since winning the state's GOP primary Feb. 28.

øIn the first quarter, China's economy expanded 8.1% year-over-year, its slowest rate in three years. China has also lowered its 2012 economic growth target below 8% for the first time since 2005. Emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa- which, along with China, are among the "priority markets" identified by the Obama administration because of their rising demand for U.S. goods - are also paring back expectations for expansion. And the developed world is grappling with a fresh recession in Europe, a slow Japanese recovery from last year's nuclear meltdown and sluggish growth elsewhere.
Obama's close ties to Chicago, as well as the city's infrastructure, its history of hosting large meetings and its ethnic diversity all played a role in its selection as the U.S. city to host the summits, he said.

Paul Benson, associate conservator for objects at the Nelson, can see the orange ball of Shuttlecock No. 1 through the windows of his office. It’s less an office than an operating room for three-dimensional art. Machinery and special lights dangle from the ceiling over pieces that are thousands of years old. A grandfather clock sits right in the center, patiently awaiting restoration.
What is one of the most important issues facing your generation? At the foundation, I have found the issue to be a fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether we will succeed, if things will work out for the best after hours of grueling work, has hindered us from putting our feet in the water and, moreover, diving right in. This fear encourages a lack of motivation to give all that we have for all that we want.

In a short featurette before the fictional narrative begins, directors Mike "Mouse" McCoy and Scott Waugh explain their decision to use actual SEALs, asserting that only the men who live the lives where "being dangerous is sacred" could deliver the authenticity they were seeking for a film that started out as a recruitment video but eventually ballooned into a $12 million dramatic feature that navigates the uncomfortable line between fiction, documentary and, yes, some good old-fashioned wartime propaganda.

That's all we've had - less than a month, actually - and yet the fantasy landscape changes quickly. But you know what they say: the more things change, the more they stay the same. There are exceptions to every rule - as I wrote last week, I believe Jason Heyward is all the way back - but by-and-large most players will regress toward our preseason expectation of them soon enough.

This is at least the third time the state has put the I-75/I-575 project out to bid. In 2005, it signed a contract for initial work, but eventually broke off that arrangement. It revised the project and put it out to bid as a public-private project last year, but canceled that bidding.
"I don't get scared about that stuff, I think it's kind of fun," said OSU senior defensive tackle Dexter Larimore, who ranks Wisconsin behind Penn State on his list of toughest Big Ten places to play.
Dark roux requires browning fat and flour while stirring constantly. The mixture will be pale at first, but as the flour browns, it gradually turns the color of peanut butter. This is a light roux. When the mixture darkens to light brown, it's a medium roux. When it looks like glossy chocolate syrup, it's a dark roux. At that point, the roux can be added to other ingredients such as celery, onion and bell pepper, or taken off the heat and stored for later. At Eat, they make dark roux once or twice a week for a variety of Cajun/Creole dishes.

In Fleming's last novels, Mendes said, Bond suffered from a "combination of lassitude, boredom, depression, difficulty with what he's chosen to do for a living, which is to kill. That makes him a much more interesting character, and some of those things are explored in this movie, because Daniel as an actor is capable of exploring them."
Last week's clear ruling was one of several this year that went against Chamber of Commerce interests in the nation's top court, perhaps a sign that the Roberts court isn't as pro-business as some critics thought after the 2010 Citizens United ruling that opened the door to secretive corporate giving in federal campaigns.

Couldn't happen to a nicer guy ... seriously. Moyer is a classy guy who proves every day that you don't have to throw 95 miles per hour to be a successful pitcher. You don't even have to throw 80 miles per hour, apparently. He has made three starts for the Rockies so far and pitched 17 2/3 innings. He lost his first two decisions, but that's a little deceptive since his ERA through those first three starts is 2.55, which ranks ninth in the NL among pitchers who have started three games.
The class itself comes in four flavors: endurance, hills, intervals, and speed. As it happens, I showed up for what I suspect is the most challenging: hills. But at least I could take comfort knowing cyclists at every other Life Time club in the U.S. were riding the same course that day.

Shipp, a veteran of the David S. Ware Quartet, has earned critical raves for his albums, which venture beyond the post-bop sound to update the innovations of Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane.

The Admiral left the St. Louis riverfront for the last time on July 19. The boat had been a St. Louis fixture since 1940, when the owner, Streckfus Steamers, completed the boat's sleek, million-dollar Art Deco skin. Hull weakness discovered by the Coast Guard in 1979 ended the Admiral's cruising days. Streckfus sold the Admiral to a Pittsburgh businessman who removed its diesel engines and announced a plan to move the boat there. He later sold it to interests in St. Louis, where it reopened in 1987 as an entertainment center managed by Six Flags. It flopped.

So there you have it. It is the reason I think the Giants will win. When the other teams have the ball, there is no edge here in coaching. In raw talent I think the Giants are simply better at playing without the ball than are the Pats.
Decked out in matching purple suits onstage in Indianapolis, Levert, Williams and Eric Nolan Grant flaunted harmonies as tight as their dance moves as they glided through a 90-minute set of their greatest hits.

An elite quarterback historically is found high in the first round of the draft, but not always. Eleven of the past 20 Super Bowls have been won by quarterbacks taken in the first round; four were the first player drafted overall.

INF Eduardo Nunez played left field for the first time in 2012 and started in the outfield for only the third time in his young career.

That buyer's market allowed Andrew Gonzales, a 24-year-old police officer in Santa Fe, N.M., to be picky about price when looking for a home for himself and his three-year-old daughter. He closed last month on a $132,000, three-bedroom home in Rio Rancho, a suburb of Albuquerque, after the price was cut twice. Just before closing, the home was appraised for $18,000 higher than the sales price, at $150,000, by a private appraiser.

Yes, I appreciate farmers. But on a more personal level, I appreciate how “my farmer” Agresto brought a farm-of-sorts to my Huntington Beach land-challenged home. Freckles romaine, sweet green lettuce dotted with splashes of burgundy, cuddle next to Bloomsdale spinach, a variety that combines bold spinach flavor with a high degree of sweetness. African Blue basil grows next to strawberries, watermelon radishes next to chard. A guava tree sends its branches out over a bed of magenta mustard.

"I couldn't believe it. I didn't even know what he was talking about,'' said the gentlemanly Parker, sitting in the clouded-green glass director's office of the new de Young Museum, whose creation has consumed him for more than a decade.

We booked the cruise, shore excursions, balcony upgrade and the missed flight all through Carnival. We want a vacation and we don't have the money because Carnival is holding us hostage. Could you help us? -- Denise Frantz, Cleveland
Meanwhile, the foundations of a strong economy -- public education, infrastructure development, commitments to research and development, and a secure safety net that protects our most vulnerable citizens from poverty -- go starved for funding.
The docking was overshadowed by the continuing Kelly-Giffords saga, with the flight director's news conference earlier in the day dominated by questions about the Arizona congresswoman.

Westlake erred in attempting an uplifting ending that doesn't ring true, but "The Comedy Is Finished" remains an enjoyable read. I only wish it had reached us sooner. But my favorite Westlake novel is still "A Likely Story" (1984), in which a freelance writer and his editor cook up a sure-fire best-seller. Soon, of course, everything that could possibly go wrong does. It's a hilarious look at the insanity of the publishing world and the freelance writer's life. Westlake knew that insanity well and for a half-century managed to triumph over it. He lived by his wits.

But they also raised concerns about the test's accuracy.
Carey: Pierre Peters Cuvee de Reserve Grand Cru (France). Another blanc de blancs, all chardonnay, but lighter and more ethereal than the Schramsberg with a beautiful biscuit dough aroma. One of the greatest trends in wine these days is the appreciation for "grower" champagnes, e.g., champagnes from the grapes grown on the property of the estate and not sourced from anywhere else, which gives the winery complete control when it comes to quality. $63.

What kind of man? "Think of all the good words in the English language," his former manager Johnny Keane once said, "and they all fit Stan." No scandals, no high-speed highway chases, no brawls over bad calls. (Musial was never ejected by an umpire in 22 years.) This guy's idea of a good time was to play his harmonica. Or to climb onto his rooftop in December and hang the Christmas display lights. Stan Musial is about as complicated as a hula hoop. His biography is chock full of examples of his generosity to friends and fans.
There is no contractual obligation to play there later, but Alnutt said "as we look down the road" MU would consider games on mutually agreeable dates with Syracuse either at Syracuse or possibly Yankee Stadium or the Meadowlands.

Take that closed-off original balcony of the Allen. There are no plans for the space, but the project budget calls for an elevator to be installed, making it accessible to the disabled in the future. It could become an intimate, 500-seat cinema.
But those were the highlights. Others in the GOP deemed it a Democratic "reelection plan" or an example of a White House that "just doesn't get it." The reaction of die-hard tea party members would be more widely quoted, but a lot of them skipped the speech entirely. Republican candidates for president had the predictable response, which is to say, they'll support the incumbent on any economic policy about the same time the Susquehanna River runs bone-dry.
Matt David, Fletcher's senior campaign adviser, accused DeMaio of "cooking up the complaint" as a way to distract and deceive voters. The campaign also released a Feb. 2 letter from the state Fair Political Practices Commission that cleared Fletcher of an allegation that he used money from his Assembly campaign account on his mayoral bid.

Another Auerbach production, this slow-grooving soul ballad sounds like it's been sitting on a shelf somewhere since sometime in the early '70s, combining the stately soul vibe of classic Bill Withers with the Band's Americana, while at the same time recalling the bittersweet ache of Otis Redding's "(Sittin' on the) Dock of the Bay." The last words out of Kiwanuka's mouth are "trying to find you something that won't fade away in time." Sounds like he found it here.
Vitale and Bilotti even go so far as to say the show violates, at least in spirit, New Jersey's hate and bias crime laws. "The bias-related acts displayed by employees of MTV Networks in the production and marketing of "Jersey Shore," by their nature, are confrontational, inflame tensions and promote social hostility," they write. "These acts are contrary to the spirit of New Jersey law and jeopardize the active and open pursuit of freedom and opportunity."

Washington Capitals: They seem capable to winning their division, but the long-term loss of center Nicklas Backstrom (post-concussion syndrome) and the near-term absence of Alexander Ovechkin makes you wonder. So does the recent struggles of goaltender Tomas Vokoun. This team has played well in spurts for new coach Dale Hunter, but other times it sleepwalks. Among the Capitals other teams are eyeballing: Puck-moving defenseman Roman Hamrlik, who could fetch at least a second-round pick.

By the end of June, the Court will announce its decision about the health care law, and a majority may well side with the government. Four justices signaled their view that the mandate is constitutional, leaving a need for only one more vote in favor. In addition, Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts both recognized that even if there is something novel about a requirement to purchase insurance, the market for health care is unique and can be governed by its own set of legal rules.
Others, like Anne Hayward, were drawn to the opposite. "I think I craved comfort foods the most. There's just a huge physical and emotional upheaval that comes with having a baby, even with an ideal birth. And for those who didn't have an ideal birth, like myself, that feeling is even more pronounced. Comfort foods were like a big hug to my exhausted self."

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Wrapping up some odds and ends as 70 teams (believe it or not) prepare for a bowl game:
A vapid Capitol representative named Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) arrives in District 12 to pull names from a bowl. To Katniss' horror, Primrose's name is selected. Knowing it's a death sentence, Katniss volunteers instead. Soon she and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the boy chosen, are on their way to the Capitol, for training and a kind of charm school. Not to make them more attractive, as Cinna (Lenny Kravitz),Katniss' stylist, explains, but to help make an impression.
Six other seats are selected by state agricultural groups, which held their election Thursday. Incumbent Carl Shaffer, a crop farmer from Columbia County and president of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, was re-elected to another three-year term.

Urban Meyer will have the team ready to rock and roll from Day One, but it’ll be a building season for 2013. The Buckeyes might not be eligible for the Big Ten championship or a bowl game, but there’s a ton of talent on both sides of the ball and QB Braxton Miller appears ready to blossom into a superstar in Meyer’s attack. At the same time the Buckeyes will play loose, since there’s no pressure with nothing to play for, and angry, because Urban is will make the team that way.
The Buckeyes join the Cornhuskers and Indiana as the only teams with three primetime games among the 14 night contests announced by the Big Ten on Tuesday. Ohio State will host Nebraska on Oct. 6 at 8 p.m., then play at Indiana on Oct. 13 at 8 p.m. and at Penn State on Oct. 27 at 6 p.m.

Kids say the darndest thigngs, part II: Danielle discovers from her pedicurist that Caroline is having a big fundraiser. She and her two daughters pile into her SUV for a jaunt to Franklin Lakes while she considers crashing the party, all the while claiming she doesn't care that she wasn't invited. One of her daughters offers some sage counsel: "You just shouldn't waste your energy on it." Says another (or possibly the same one, it was hard to tell): "I'm not going to sit here and let you make a jerk of yourself." Danielle: "You think that's what I'm going to do?" Both chime in: "Yeah." She turns the car around ... this time.

New sporting equipment seems to be outdated as soon as it hits the shelves. Advanced technology, improved performance, even the latest color scheme can quickly turn what's hot today into cold tomorrow. And golf clubs are no exception. Trust me, the corner in our garage occupied by my husband's dusty irons drives this point home. You could lighten the load of drivers, wedges and putters through a garage sale or by donating them to a golf course, such as The Children's Course. Or you could turn them into a coat rack: My husband's favorite is one I made from unused drivers. He still gets to keep his clubs (well, at least part of them) and I get more garage space for the important things, like flower pots and bags of dirt. It's "fore" the best.

Bernanke also expressed concerns about millions who have been out of work for more than six months. Those long-term unemployed Americans have made up more than 40 percent of the unemployed since December, he said. In the severe 1981-82 recession, long-term unemployment never exceeded 25 percent.
Earlier today, I met Endia and William Eason. Endia is 91 years old, and she's known for making some of the best pies in Cleveland. William is a former Marine who now lives in a nursing home nearby. Ten years ago, the Easons were approached by a broker who offered to help them take out loans and make some much-needed repairs to their house. The broker made everything sound easy, so the Easons agreed. But before they knew it, the broker had disappeared with their money – leaving the Easons almost $80,000 in debt and in danger of losing their home.
Maryland's restrictions on carrying a handgun outside the home have been among the strongest in the nation — and for good reason, given the death and destruction perpetrated by those possessing handguns in this state. So it is regrettable that the standard is now under threat because a federal judge, emboldened by a pair of recent Supreme Court decisions that have expanded the reach of the Second Amendment, has found a portion of the law unconstitutional.
On our way back to L.A. a few days later, we paid our final respects to the highway's farming roots at Sal's original Mexican restaurant in Selma.

The original owner, Sal Salazar, worked in the nearby peach orchards before opening the restaurant in 1942.

Just as Dave Matthews did at his own destination event, Metallica will headline each night of the Orion Fest. Orion is slated for June 23 and 24 -- a week after the Phish shows.

Religious institutions can qualify for an exemption if the services violate their beliefs, but not if they employ large numbers of people who do not share those beliefs.

They seized momentum with a 14-0 third-quarter run and held off rally after rally from the Jazz in the fourth. The Blazers scored 30 points, shot 50 percent from the field and committed just three turnovers in the fourth quarter, when they led by as many as eight points. Only a late scoring burst from All-Star point guard Deron Williams, who had 10 points in the final 31 seconds, prevented the final score from being more lopsided.

The biggest of these is the case involving health care in the state prisons. About 10 years ago, legal advocates and inmates began suing the state in federal court, claiming that the care in the prisons was so bad that it represented cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.

To blame the victims' basic goodness and commitment to providing aid for bringing this tragedy upon themselves is a deplorable explanation for an unspeakable and isolated crime that could have occurred anywhere. I have always looked at The Sun as a publication committed to community building that covers and is written for a wide demographic of readers; the inclusion of the comments of Mr. Nichols can only be viewed as a misstep in the newspaper's strong legacy of good reporting and journalistic sensitivity.

Gordimer brings these and other characters to life with her terse, unsentimental prose. Her writing can be poetic: "A motorbike ripped the street like a sheet of paper roughly torn."
