I think being optimistic. Being able to be clear about your vision. In my role, I'm a little different because I'm the boss and I'm the owner. What I think is critical is they understand the vision and that I make them feel like they're part of the overall team. You can't get to the next level in any business without good employees. You can't do it all yourself.
Monet didn't document his plans for the garden, so there is a limited amount of material to go on. "Monet never worked with exact precision," Vahe says. "It was a garden of sensations."

Excuse me? What would you call a free pass to Columbia and then Harvard Law? For a guy who thinks there are 57 states and that they speak “Austrian” in Austria? Who pronounces corpsman “corpseman”? Who became editor of the Harvard Law Review without ever having written a single article for the publication?

2010 A.J. Adam Dhron Hofberg Mosel Riesling Kabinett ($33, 8%): Andreas Adam's indigenously fermented wines showcase this tiny middle Mosel village. But they can have a quiet phase, as with the 2010 Hofberg. Petrol and citrus-pith aromas show an invigorating side, and the ripe apricot and anise flavors have a polished texture. A deep wine in need of cellar age. (Importer: A Terry Theise Selection/Michael Skurnik Wines)
Blake says you can order the real thing and have it shipped to your home for about $50 from bakeries like Gambinos or Manny Randazzo's King Cakes, or you can fake one yourself with an easy recipe listed on her site.

Many of the Stumptown's fans in Portland fell in love with its indie and irreverent roots as much as its flavor. For them, turning to an investment banker -- one with ties to now collapsed Bear Stearns, notes one local blogger -- flies in the face of its underground underdog image.
Last year, the pipeline safety agency shelved a study when no suitable co-financier or manager stepped forward. The subject was a type of seam weld present in pre-1970 pipelines - a majority of the current inventory - that is vulnerable to rupture.

At the core of its turnaround is MetroHealth's plan to reduce the amount of free care it gives, aggressively steering patients to primary-care physicians and signing up previously nonpaying poor patients for the federal Medicaid program, which will pay for their treatment. The hospital reported it has signed up 6,668 patients with Medicaid since January, earning the hospital nearly $25 million. Before, that money would have been lost.

TfL is leaving no stone unturned as it plans to deal with an influx of Olympic foreign visitors. Some £8.8 million is being spent on a promotional campaign, which includes a website—getaheadofthegames.com—that pinpoints expected travel hot spots.

A romance with humor, the movie also broods wistfully on the theme of searching for a place in the world that feels right. It doesn't exactly fit neatly into the broad categories favored by Hollywood. "It has a little bit of a fantasy element, with the mechanical man. It has some comedy. It has some drama. And it's played all very realistically," Fischer says by phone. "It's those movies in the middle ground that are sometimes harder to get made, but they also happen to be my favorite movies."
One of the more interesting topics of the talk was Bruce saying why the song The Promise was left off Darkness on the Edge of Town.
Looser liquor laws, such as newly allowed Sunday sales in Georgia, were another reason given. As far as liquor exports, Cressy said, recent trade developments have made it easier.

Christmas on stage
A number of House Republicans opposed the plan, too, because they felt Boehner's cuts didn't go far enough. Conservative groups like the Club For Growth argued the bill wouldn't guarantee future spending reductions or require Congress to send states a balanced budget amendment. They also noted that the final bill won't prevent a new commission from suggesting tax hikes.
A spokesman for Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester Jr., said, "The only people sitting around on the couch enjoying life these days are the millionaires who have been coddled by Gov. Christie. Everyone else is working as hard as they can to pay for the net 20 percent property tax hike they’ve endured under this governor."
Game 5:Mullen 7, Falcon 1
We pretty much left it to readers to bring their own skepticism to Brito's words. Judging from Talk of the Day, they did so.
Mr. McConnell is right. But he isn't a pundit. Why the hell is he reading his stage direction out loud? Last fall, he said that the "single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." Most conservatives agree with him, because without a Republican president, you can't repeal ObamaCare or do the other things conservatives believe are necessary to set the country back on the right track. Democrats see things the same way, but from a liberal perspective.

The annual survey was sent to about 8,000 employees. Fewer than half sent back a completed survey by the deadline in early February.
I am not particularly annoyed by the overall protests. It's an American tradition for the aggrieved to take to the streets. These folks need an economic lesson at the very least, and none of us should tolerate violence or destruction. But many of the Occupiers appear more open to ideas than our state legislators, who continually express similar ill-defined anti-corporate sentiments. To those who run California's grotesquely large and bumbling state government, the problem always is the same: the private sector, a good bit of which is fleeing to other states.
But the big break came from tests that would have seemed like science fiction back in the day when the best a lab tech could do was determine blood type.
So let’s rewind and take a look at how far we’ve travelled, around the globe and through time, with Chris Martin. A Londoner, he pulled a lick from a South American dance hit from 1990 that was first recorded by an Australian television personality a decade earlier, and he got the idea while enjoying an entirely different form of entertainment from the one that made him famous.
The guys may be babies, but their DNA makes it clear they are already Stooges, with an eye poke that sends Sister Mary-Mengele flying. From that point on, the eye-poking and the eye-rolling never stop. As the boys grow up, the head slaps and the rest of the highly choreographed hitting mayhem that characterizes all the Stooges interactions becomes the centerpiece of the movie. The success of the film hangs on pulling off the sight gags, with the Farrellys' getting the rhythm of a Stooges bit — basically action, bad reaction, then over-reaction — mostly right.

Tehran has denied that request as well as deflecting bids by the IAEA to interview scientists suspected of involvement in alleged covert research and development work into nuclear arms.
It was Bagnall who took a call recently from Pandarvis, whose wife had bought Yadah when the monkey was just a few weeks old. The small primate was OK for a while. Then Pandarvis suffered a workplace injury and went on disability, cutting the family's income and making Yadah a drain on the budget. He also became harder to handle.

What ties every room together is the Douglas fir covering the tall timber-frame ceilings and walls. "A modern open floor plan and metals could have given it a chilly feeling," said Larson. "The Douglas fir gives it a warm and rich interior."
But sources said Democrats had been told by Sweeney not to give ground on their votes. Several sources close to the nomination who were familiar with party strategy said Sarlo was concerned that if he voted with Republicans, he might lose his position as chair of the Senate budget committee. The sources requested anonymity because they are not allowed to divulge internal party discussions. Sarlo did not return a message seeking comment.

The shooting remains under investigation.
"We don’t want to make it feel like this is for elitists, for people who are already environmentalists. We want GreenFest to draw people who can come to learn," he said. "The major focus is kids.

-- The search to replace Joe "The Tank" Halahuni at tight end continues, though after April it looks like Colby Prince is the winner. Riley described Prince as "solid, knows what he's doing" and said the other guys are 50/50: "They'll get beat or they'll make a play, it's 50/50. They've got to improve that part for us to be a factor in the fall." True freshman Caleb Smith has the build of a future star, but let's remember that he's new to this college football thing.

The performers bring their iconic roles to vibrant life: Greer infuses Faustus with a Jack Black-style manic energy; Mixon is dryly funny as the conflicted Luther, and McNall delivers an amusing counterpoint to the Hamlet he played far more seriously at the Pearl a few seasons back. Also fine is Joey Parsons in several female roles, including the Virgin Mary.

Jennifer Siebel Newsom attends hundreds of community and philanthropic events a year and is one of the city's most-photographed women. Although her elegant, minimalist style is well documented, she doesn't consider herself a fashionista. "It's not my purpose and passion in life," she says.
For starters, the chips were crisp and salty, and the once-soupy salsa was now properly chunky. The Hacienda margarita ($9) came with a salted rim, even though the Web site says the restaurant's motto is, "Rocks, no salt.'' When I asked about the salt, the server said I had ordered it that way -- which wasn't the case. He took it back, but it was apparent the bartender hadn't remixed the drink but simply transferred the contents to another glass.
A: I'm slotted to do 10 books. I'm writing "Seductive Tables for Two" to be released in February. Phoenix photographer John Hall has been shooting my pictures since my son was a little kid.

We asked Bryan whether he knew any fun shots, and he poured a couple of chocolate-covered pretzel shots ($6; Frangelico, whipped-cream vodka).

That's an interesting coincidence, although Wilf does own real estate in California and has a fleet of planes.

Kelly Dwyer, Yahoo! Sports: For the Blazers? We have no clue why they made this deal, outside of benevolence. Camby deserves to play with a playoff team as his career winds down, and the Blazers (with embarrassing losses to Indiana and New York dotting the days up to the trade deadline) were clearly out of the playoff hunt due to the injury woes of Greg Oden and Brandon Roy, and the flan-based falloff of point guard Raymond Felton. Not to be cruel, but Hasheem Thabeet does not have a future in the NBA following the expiration of his contract this July, and Flynn isn't far off.

If youve ever looked to your freezer for a culinary assist at the end of a long day only to close it again because nothing sounds appealing, its time to stock up on some Culinary Center of Kansas City frozen dinners.

•A favorite: Anne Tyler finally has a new novel, "The Beginner's Goodbye," her first since "Noah's Compass" in 2010. Besides loving her insightful books, I also like her titles: "A Slipping-Down Life," "The Accidental Tourist," "Saint Maybe."
While Japanese-run restaurants, labels, stores and bars have come to dominate the scene, in Japan's high-end hotel business, foreign brands rule. Yet what's interesting is that they haven't thrived by simply imposing their outside vision of luxury accommodations on Japan. The Peninsula Tokyo (whose parent company is based in Hong Kong) has been successful, Thompson explains, by incorporating deep Japanese hospitality into its model. "In other parts of the world, I would have to train staff on how to behave toward guests," Thompson says. "Here, that's the kind of knowledge every Japanese employee already possesses on an almost instinctive level."
Dan Wetzel, Yahoo! Sports: "Behind all the laughs and one-liners though, this is what Rex Ryan is all about. Right here, right now. New York vs. New England, both teams perched at 9-2, an AFC East title and home-field advantage in the playoffs potentially on the line. It's the biggest regular-season game of the season and that's exactly the kind of thing Ryan always wanted to be involved in. He's a funny guy. He's also a driven, intense coach with an insatiable desire to win. Combine it and you get one of the game's greatest characters who has proven in a little over a season and a half he can back up every joke."
The outcome was a crushing blow to Livni's once-high hopes of becoming Israel's first female prime minister since the legendary Golda Meir. Livni had led Kadima, a centrist party founded by former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in the 2009 elections, gaining more parliamentary seats than Netanyahu's Likud Party, but she was unable to forge a majority coalition.

Two students testified that when Clementi requested the room again on Sept. 21, Ravi set up the webcam so it was angled at Clementi’s bed and invited his Twitter followers to watch. But Clementi was monitoring Ravi’s Twitter account and disconnected the plug from his computer.

Part of this story is already known. When Ricardo Zarate's modest Peruvian restaurant in a working-class neighborhood is followed by a much fancier Peruvian restaurant south of Beverly Hills, the quality of the cooking and the ingredients is the same. In fact, it is for Mo-Chica, the lunch counter near USC, that Zarate was named one of the best new chefs in the country last year by Food & Wine. When Roy Choi left a high-paid job as an executive hotel chef to grill Korean tacos on a food truck, his cooking reached people in a way that it never could have at the Beverly Hilton. He too was honored by the magazine. When former l'Orangerie chef Ludovic Lefebvre, a protégé of revered French chefs Alain Passard and Pierre Gagnaire, became obsessed with American fried chicken during one of the runs of his pop-up restaurant LudoBites, he spun off a fried-chicken truck that often sees lines wrapping around the block.
A: Attracting a team. That's where you can make a lot of mistakes. It's really hard to take things back from people. It's really hard to change their status with you - especially when you are creating a company. For instance, I called everyone who joined the company in 2007 the "founding team." And in the short term, it was great, because it really motivated a lot of people. But longer term, it creates some weird egos and things where people feel like they're co-founders. I had like 30 or 40 people who felt like co-founders. At the outset, be really explicit about what you're agreeing to and what you're not. I see lots of, you know, entrepreneurs and founding teams make assumptions about the relationship before they've all agreed on it.

The stimulus partly drives the rush on health care. The program was so ill-considered and so festooned with irrelevant liberal priorities as the price of hustling it through Congress that it becomes more of a drag for Obama every day. So health care has to be rushed through before Obama pays the full price for the failure of his previous rush job. Haste -- and waste -- makes for more haste.

The result: standardized test scores that are among the highest in the city, far above those in surrounding schools. There is little evidence that Synergy achieves this by handpicking star students. Many parents say they enrolled their children at Synergy specifically because they were failing at a nearby school.

Ohio certainly shines in "Take Shelter," although a good chunk of it may be destroyed if the apocalyptic visions come true. Producing quality film minus the money and marketing of the major studios is endlessly daunting, so I asked the people in Davidson's life why he is able to sustain an Ohio-based independent filmmaking career where countless others have failed.

You only learned in paragraphs buried deep in the news stories that the House was not even asked to consider the actual commission plan. To cobble together bipartisan support, sponsors of the ersatz Simpson-Bowles amendment kept all of the commission's spending cuts but slashed the amount it prescribed for tax increases in half. See how relentless pressure from the right turns self-styled moderates into conservatives? If there's a cave-in, it's always to starboard.

Culture. Beyond Elderhostel, other educational groups and tour operators from budget to luxury offer a wide variety of cultural tours. What's your interest? Literature? Music? Opera? Natural history? Native cultures? Spirituality? Cooking? Language? Options here run the gamut from low-cost walking tours in England's literature centers to expensive classical music or jazz cruises to three-week intensive courses in French or Italian cooking. If you ever attended a college or university, you probably get bombarded with tour and cruise promotions focused on some cultural theme and accompanied by leading professors in their fields.

In 2006, Coppola changed the property's name to Rubicon Estate, but he had begun to question the trajectory of his grand effort. In the fields, he saw old vines ripped out for replanting, mostly to increase yields. Rafael Rodriguez, who had managed Inglenook's vineyards since the 1950s - and was crucial enough to its success that one of Coppola's early moves was to rehire him for $40,000, an estimable salary in 1976 - was essentially forced out.
Folks haven't forgotten.
Much of the early criticism of "The Social Network" stems from the fact that it is nominally based on Ben Mezrich's book, "The Accidental Billionaires." When it was published, the work was widely criticized for playing fast and loose with the facts - not just by Facebook but by reviewers such as the New York Times' Janet Maslin, who said the book was "so obviously dramatized, and so clearly unreliable, that there's no mistaking it for a serious document."
OLCC commissioners could accept or reject liquor-license requests based on the legal interpretations of existing rules. Or they could ask legislators to change the law to allow alcohol service from carts that meet certain conditions, but the legislative process could take six months or longer, according to Allahdadi. And any new rules regarding alcohol sales from food carts aren't likely to cover all carts, which take many forms and inhabit varied locations. OLCC evaluates all alcohol-license requests individually, with input from local governments.

AND OF course, as Spielberg began to rake in the riches, this was held against him too. It has always been a truism of popular culture, no more so than in the '70s, that artistry and commercial success are mutually exclusive. And where exceptions to this rule were made, as in the case of "The Godfather" films, it was because they were recognized as gangster films in name only. They were really about the corruption of the American dream. Spielberg's early movies are rife with broken families and intimations of child abandonment, but they are glittery baubles when placed beside the dungeon-like Coppola and Scorsese pictures (especially "The Godfather" films, "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull") with their floridly Catholic sense of sin and redemption. Spielberg, by comparison, at least up through "The Color Purple," specialized in uplift, in the exaltation of the American dream. He himself became its personification.

The punishment Gee and Smith handed down on March 8 was a wrist slap for a wealthy coach -- a two-game suspension -- when the guilty players were serving five games, and a $250,000 fine. This was despite the fact that Tressel had twice been reprimanded in yearly evaluations by Smith's predecessor, Andy Geiger, for lack of timeliness in reporting violations and for failure to monitor automobile purchases by his players. (There is no written trail under Smith, who issues oral evaluations.)

But shining a light on ALEC and its supporters - a roster that includes many companies, from AT&T and Coca-Cola to UPS, that have so far managed to avoid being publicly associated with the hard-right agenda - is one good way to highlight what's going on. And that kind of knowledge is what we need to start taking our country back.

He is the enemy of big government, and of Democrats' "can't do" condescending attitude toward minorities. Cain exudes a positive and optimistic spirit.

Romney is a "patriotic American who has raised a wonderful family," and has been a successful businessman and governor, the president said.

I wonder if this is in any way analogous to church life. "Come as you are" is a popular catchphrase, but maybe it's not enough. The hospitable host still has guidelines, rules even, about what is acceptable behavior in his home. Jesus ate with sinners, in their homes, and pretty much on their own terms.

Unfortunately, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserts that Mr. Abbas can have peace with Israel or unity with Hamas, but not both. The Catch-22 is that Israel used the split in territorial control between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas as an excuse to not negotiate. Now that this has resolved, the very resolution is a reason to not negotiate.

Jaz is a cyber-scientist for an investment bank; Lisa is a promising editor at a publishing house. All is future and possibility. Until fate presents them with an autistic son.

A In the last movement of the "Appassionata" sonata, there's the coda. If you have a piano that responds very quickly, you can play it a lot faster than on a modern instrument without losing any of the clarity. And it's not for the purpose of showing how fast you can go, like a sports car; the music asks for it.

Answer: You don't. You can't. The right pieces are not yet in place or in range to cure all that ails the Padres, and some of those pieces may not materialize any time soon. Unless the franchise is swiftly sold to ownership committed to a significant infusion of cash, the short-term outlook is sameness.
But Van Almsick isn't letting go; this isn't his first PT rodeo. The youthful-looking 62-year-old has been in the Acute Rehab Department of St. Anthony's Medical Center since early January, following emergency open-heart surgery that left him weak and unsteady on his feet. He's in the final stretch now - only one more week before he returns to his home in south county and his wife, Susan.

Joyce knew something like this could happen when he set out to be a major-league umpire. (OK, maybe he didn't envision something quite this big.) Umpires know the oven can get really hot if a call is blown for all the world to see. It is why some of us never pursued umpiring beyond Pony League; we don't have the stomach for the intense backlash.

After being thrust into an odd scenario with two orbs, intimidating music, and a few swiping motions, I’m at a character creation screen of sorts. My sperm, which currently holds the rank of “squire,” has no bonuses applied. I tap a box and a piece of broccoli appears. I do it again. I try a third time, but a dialog box pops up and informs me “broccoli not have.” Does broccoli help your sperm count? Is this something I should know?
These days, though, most of us don't spend enough time in that happy place. All work and no play doesn't just make Jack (and Jill) a dull boy (girl). It also negates something that's hardwired into the human psyche, say play experts. You may have read about a recent dig in Pakistan where 1-in-10 artifacts from a 4,000-year-old city were fun-related. Or heard about a new theory that Stone Age humans were able to hunt, gather and live in groups because they played together in the same way we do today in childhood kickball or grown-up tennis: sharing laughter, friendly competition and cooperation.

SB805, with the proposed amendments, gradually takes effect over the next 15 years, giving Oregon farmers time to invest nearly $65 million in the necessary new housing for laying hens. Out-of-state egg producers will have to match these investments if they want to continue to sell their eggs in our state. We agree, for hens today, change can't come soon enough. We do believe our proposal will result in progressive standards that will set the bar for hen welfare across the country in the future. That's an Oregon solution of which we can be proud.
Ohio reduced its smoking rate by about 5 percentage points over four years starting in 2001 when it allocated as much as $60 million annually to tobacco prevention.

That is just the beginning.

I'm a firm believer that this is one of the best school systems in the state based on assessment measures, arguably the best in the country. How do we showcase that? How do we continue to develop our workforce? ... ...How can we go to the next level? Why aren't we leading? In Montgomery, they communicate, they collaborate, and they're effective at those. We could learn how to become more of a partner with our internal stakeholders, like the union groups, our parents, our PTAs, different CACs that exist and move forward from there. I get the sense there's a need for some more of that occur.

The contentious primaries illustrated the fight for the direction of the Republican Party in the post-George W. Bush era.
