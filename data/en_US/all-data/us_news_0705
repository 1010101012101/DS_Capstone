It's far from certain. Start-up businesses are highly risky ventures. And the number of shares a company issues could remain small. That means there may be little market if investors want to sell their stock. Crowdfunding could make a lot of money for a sliver of early investors. But many more people will probably lose money.
When I'm in better shape, we actually descend the steep side and climb back up, then descend the steep side again and continue on. It's a nice way to get some really tough elevation in there before miles of flat roads. That wasn't happening this time. My legs were already a little rubbery.
But in the short term, at least, the cuts are not expected to have a big impact on New Jerseyans.
Thank heavens the two men are Tommy Lee Jones (who also directed) and Samuel L. Jackson. Jones plays White, a professor who, that morning, attempted to kill himself by jumping in front of a subway train known as the Sunset Limited.

There are other changes in the new, third-generation iPad—called simply "iPad," with no number, which goes on sale on Friday at the same base price as its predecessor, $499. But the key upgrades are to those core features—the 9.7-inch screen and the data speed over cellular networks. These upgrades are massive. Using the new display is like getting a new eyeglasses prescription—you suddenly realize what you thought looked sharp before wasn't nearly as sharp as it could be.

The road maps are focused on identifying and building on the core strengths we have today. But we know that new opportunities will emerge from this strong base. For example, new companies, collaborations and partnerships will develop from our core strengths that will generate new ideas, new technologies and new products. In turn, this will stimulate the region's manufacturing-supply-chain companies to transition into the advanced-energy industry, ultimately attracting more funding, companies and resources to Northeast Ohio. All of this activity is a result of focusing on the region's core strengths.

UO’s offense vs. Arizona State’s defense: Running back Kenjon Barner is a quality back. Freshmen De’Anthony Thomas and Tra Carson certainly are talented. LaMichael James, however, is special. The absence of the program’s all-time leading rusher and scorer can’t help but hurt. Barner has been productive but in limited spurts with 1,085 yards rushing (167 this year) during his three-year career. Thomas and Carson have combined for 326 yards on 49 carries this season with very little coming while a game was in doubt. They must run against a defense led by linebackers Vontaze Burfict and Colin Parker, and safety Eddie Elder. ASU is second in the conference in scoring defense (19.5 points per game) and total defense (349 yards per game). This is a better unit than the one that held Oregon to 385 yards of total offense last season. ASU has forced 18 turnovers, including 10 in the last two games. Oregon has one turnover since committing four in its season-opening loss to LSU.

No doubt millions of Americans will regard it as great that 10 years after the start of our involvement in Afghanistan and one year after the elimination of Osama bin Laden, President Barack Obama signed the accord with President Hamid Karzai affirming the withdrawal of NATO troops in 2014 ("Obama: U.S. to 'finish the job,' May 2). So far, so good. But wait, as Paul Harvey would have put it, "the rest of the story" is the U.S. has made a commitment of another 10 years of aid and advisors and undoubtedly more billions of dollars than the administration cares to estimate publicly.

This is the problem... When you have a Rolls Royce in the driveway instead of in the garage. Dwight Howard is not a Honda or a Toyota, he's the Rolls Royce on this team. You make everything work through him, you take care of him because you know he is more valuable than the other players on the team. Stan Van Gundy is the auto worker that believes he can get the Honda and Toyota to look better and drive better than the Rolls Royce. Paints the Honda and Toyota as though they are better. Parks them in the garage while leaving the Rolls Royce outside to brave the natural elements. The problem is when he comes out of his little world, no one sees things the way he does. And his way is proven to not work.

No, it was never anything I dreamed was even a remote possibility. I came to it much later in life when I found myself with two small children and a lot of time at home. And I started writing and playing songs, and then I thought I would look for somebody to improve my guitar technique. And I happened to find this guy who was also interested in writing and playing songs, the guitar teacher. Then we started writing together and performing with his brother, and then because the two of them were in that world, we brought in more musicians as time went on. Then it morphed into a desire to record, so we did one CD. Then we had more songs so we did another CD, and it slowly grew from there. I think that shedding my past and image of myself by leaving my profession and career in my former country gave me the complete freedom to throw myself into this thing without having the burden of my image of myself hanging over me.

I'm still not entirely sure why these movies don't have better buzz as they are both really solid flicks, but both will be bringing up the rear on Oscar night. I guess "War Horse" is getting the shaft because it was directed by Steven Spielberg and the Academy loves to shaft Spielberg for any movie he makes that is not set during World War II. They really got him this year by not even nominating his "The Adventures of Tin Tin" for best animated film. Take that for delivering 30 years of beloved, quality films, Steve!
The new Star Tours attraction that will soon debut at Disneyland adds several layers of 3-D realism to the 1980s-era simulator ride, making the experience less like watching a movie and more like being in the middle of the action.

"My visit got delayed a couple of days because of bad weather here in Texas, so he would've been there if I would've gone when I was supposed to,'' said Tannehill. "He actually had some obligations he had to go to.''
in our pizza poll; Seamus McDaniel's came in first in our burger poll. I smell a trend: hometown favorites that have amassed a big following over the years but don't necessarily live up to the hype. There's nothing wrong with this burger - it's big, beefy and comes with all the right accoutrements - but there's also nothing that screams "No. 1." Maybe I should have taken the option to sub provel for my cheddar, but something tells me that wouldn't have helped.

We reached out to more experts and read additional academic studies. We heard the same thing again and again – simple safety straps could greatly reduce the risk of a TV tipping over and killing a child. But manufacturers aren’t required to include the straps with the TVs, and a number of electronic stores that sell TVs don’t always carry the straps. Advocates called for the straps to be included at the time people walk out of the store with their TVs.
Biggest year: 2010, with 26,054 entrants and 22,361 finishers
It's not stretch to say that this was the biggest win for this program in almost six years. Not since the road win on March 3, 2006 at No. 8 Pittsburgh — which helped clinch an NCAA Tournament spot for the Pirates — has this program enjoyed a win of this magnitude. Based on what this team is currently doing (and perhaps will do throughout the season), the win over UConn is one that will put this team on the map. Seton Hall had a very solid (if not, very good) NCAA Tournament resume before Tuesday night's win. Smacking Connecticut around convincingly is going to be enormous for their profile going forward. Now, the Pirates certainly can't go in the tank and lose to the Providences, DePauls and South Floridas of the league, but this will afford them some breathing room if they're stacked up against similar profiles in the at-large pool at the end of the year. Before this opening three-game stretch of Big East play, we felt that Seton Hall needed to go at least 1-2 to feel safe about being an NCAA contender for the rest of the season. Instead, they went 2-1 and are strongly in the equation.

Nearly a month after an unarmed black teenager was shot to death by a neighborhood watch captain, police in Sanford, Fla., have yet to make an arrest. Seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin was returning from a convenience store near the house of his father's fiancee in a gated community Feb. 26 when watch leader George Zimmerman spotted him and called police to report a "suspicious" person. Moments later, Mr. Zimmerman confronted the teen — ignoring the dispatcher's advice not to follow the youngster — and shot him in the chest, apparently as Mr. Martin pleaded for his life.

San Francisco's old auto row on Van Ness Avenue is getting its luster back.
To turn into an effective human pathogen, a germ has to be able to spread easily among humans. That means it has to make the human host shed it into the outside environment where it can be picked up by another host. Transmission is a subtle business, and the ability to transmit, to manipulate the host into producing symptoms that get the germ out of one body and into the next, has to evolve. That evolution can take place only by the germ cycling among people. Not bats. Not pigs. People. And enough of them that the virus gets better and better adapted to its new hosts. Only then can it turn, temporarily or permanently, into a human-adapted germ.

The Christ the King transfer was supposed to form a potent 1-2 backcourt punch with Austin Williams; instead he carried much of the scoring load when Williams went down with a knee injury in January, averaging 16 points per game.

In the midst of this breakdown a few other storylines managed to creep in; Amanda is becoming jealous of the chemistry between Emily and Jack, which makes me wonder what IS happening between them. Are they the Ross and Rachel of our generation? Ashley and Nolan walk away arm-in-injured-arm at the end of the episode (have these two ever spoken?). Is Nolan next on Ashley’s desperate attempt to climb the social ladder? If reality television has taught us anything, it’s that a woman who desperately wants to marry rich will continually lower her standards until she is able to.

Obviously, vetting a vice presidential candidate's background is crucial. But often, nominees are lured by the siren's song of strategy.

Los Angeles voters need to know how well the six candidates for district attorney grasp the facts of direct filing and whether and how often — and why — they would exercise that option. It may be interesting to know how much money each candidate has raised, who has endorsed them and what they say about each other, but before making their decisions voters must extract from the candidates more fundamental information about their knowledge, their attitudes, their values and their abilities. The attitude toward charging youths as adults is one of several key areas in which the candidates must be probed and prodded.

Two pizza shells, pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese, that's what came in the package of "make-at-home pizzas." Every week, my mom would buy two packages for our Sunday night dinner. Every Sunday we would have pizza, made to order. My dad would have his own, each of my brothers would have his own, and my mom and I would split one. I would usually be the one to make them. The kitchen counter would be set up like an assembly line. Large pieces of aluminum foil first and then the shells with sauce carefully spread out on them. I had made them so often that all I would have to ask is "The usual tonight?" and everyone would say, "Yes!"-- Kathy Marusczak, Burton

It is a skyscraper, though at 768 feet not an especially tall one.

I use natural fibers and try to impact my environment by making things to order; I don't over-produce. I also try to sustain the economy that supports me.

It’s a nickname that the shrewd pop star encourages. Much of Lady Gaga’s appeal is maternal. She is an alternate-reality parent who offers her Little Monsters acceptance and unconditional love, and who creates a safe place for misfits to express themselves. Never mind that many of her listeners choose to proclaim their individuality by dressing up exactly like Lady Gaga; it’s all too easy for grown-up cynics to make fun of that paradox. For young people taking tentative steps toward establishing identities of their own, mimicking Gaga -- a woman who seems to be entirely self-fashioned -- offers rewards that may not be immediately visible. The outlandish costume may be entertaining, but it’s ultimately secondary. It’s a sign that marks an internal transformation; a conversion, if only for a night, from victimized outcast to superpowered monster.

While there's an important story here  how these women take in endangered animals with the intention of later releasing them back into the wild  the main attraction is the general adorableness. While so many movies offer a seemingly pointless 3-D element, "Born to Be Wild" has some spectacular moments. Thanks to an economical run time and a touching story line, "Born to Be Wild" feels like a ready-made afternoon of family fun.
Juliet Noriega, the wardrobe supervisor, said she would return to the show in a heartbeat. In fact, she said she was contacted earlier this year to come back to do the pageant.

That's all the more evidence that shows like All-American Muslim are needed. Recall what The Cosby Show did for Americans' perception of race  yes, blacks can be affluent and upper-middle class and funny. Then there was Ellen for gay Americans, which laid the groundwork for the portrayal of gay parenting in ABC's Modern Family. The show doesn't shy from the often effeminate characteristics of its popular co-stars. Most viewers get the humor, and are willing to live and let live.

Wow! Mill Valley hasn't received such attention since the song of the same name, recorded by third-graders and their teacher in 1970, was an unlikely hit single. Nonetheless, I would add a disclaimer that applies to similar "towns" tucked within a large metropolitan region like ours. A village-like suburb might feel like a bucolic world unto itself, but reality is much more complex.
The problem with Barnz's conceit is that, the film's title notwithstanding, the protagonist isn't a beast. Unlike the hairy animals of the previous movies, he's merely a not-very-sightly human: his "beastliness" looks like the work of a bad plastic surgeon and a seriously overzealous tattooist. The whole point of Cocteau's poetic romance is that the hero, for all his civility and courtly manners, is also an extremely deadly animal - a natural predator who when he falls in love with Belle has to muster every ounce of his willpower to refrain from killing and eating her.

Though she's amply proved she can handle heavy emotional demands, in the likes of "Friends With Money" and "The Good Girl," Jennifer Aniston prefers to deliver her goods in reliable ways. Year after year, she graces light comedies with a uniquely relatable blend of smarts and sex appeal for which men (understandably) desire her, while women (amazingly) seem not to resent her. In the words of David Wain, who helms her and Paul Rudd in the upcoming ensemble comedy "Wanderlust": "She's so special. She's like a superhero, yet she's totally down to earth. Some of her movies over the years have been better than others, but she always shines." A decade as one of TV's unforgettable "Friends" made her an undeniable known commodity, but longevity in the medium was by no means assured. On the contrary, Hollywood lists dozens of tube stars whose bigscreen dreams quickly sputtered out or remained stillborn. Aniston stands alone in having parlayed 10 years in a single recurring series role into an uninterrupted string of bigscreen leads. Meanwhile her technique, the secret of that success, has earned her insufficient credit. Of giant B.O. hit "Marley & Me," a cynic might sniff, "All that mattered was the guy and the dog. Any actress could've pulled off that second-banana part." Yet Aniston's casting was indispensible in four unsung ways: ** She's adept at broad comedy. (She starts off "The Bounty Hunter" locked in a trunk; as one of the "Horrible Bosses" she strips down to leather to sexually harass an employee.) Not many 40ish women would let themselves be dragged across the room by a runaway hound. ** She has a high boiling point -- a tendency to react to chaos with just a raised eyebrow. A thesp who screeched at her dog's first mishap would have nowhere to go in subsequent reels. Aniston parcels out her pique at the pooch, eventually exploding for maximum mirth. ** She can leaven her lightness with poignancy. It's not easy to factor a miscarriage and post-partum depression into a warmhearted family comedy, but Aniston manages it handily. ** You can readily believe Owen Wilson would do anything to keep her. Pic's spine is the tension between concern for his family and caring for a clearly unstable pet. The yummy Aniston keeps that tension in balance. In "Wanderlust," she again matches a strong male co-star in charisma and warmth. Says Wain of a pivotal late scene, "She really has to convince an audience to have sympathy for a woman deciding to stay at this commune where everyone has free sex, and let her husband go. Somehow she's able to navigate that, and deliver it with feeling and understanding." Any carping critics seem to not consider everything Aniston can do. One thinks of another skilled light comedienne of years past who successfully balanced wit and sex appeal in a string of similar roles: Once Myrna Loy became Nora Charles, she more or less stayed Nora Charles to no one's complaint. Aniston's may career take a turn that is unexpected to her audience. But even if she forgoes the deglamourized parts that can be awards fodder (as did Loy), people are sure to scan the TV listings for years to come and say of her, as they do of Loy, "Oh, I love her, she's always good." As legacies go, that one's not bad at all.

There's no question Muti has brought new vigor, a sleeker and more refined sound, and a renewed sense of artistic purpose to an orchestra that had grown rather adipose during predecessor Daniel Barenboim's controversial 15-season tenure, which ended in 2006.

Clearly not caught up in the October euphoria, the Handbook's predictions offer a blunt view of the new-look Cardinals' lineup. Not a single regular starter is projected to have an on-base percentage better than .400. Only one regular is expected to get more than 100 RBIs, but no one is expected to hit more than 30 homers. Matt Holliday is the only everyday player predicted to hit better than .300. Those projections may be purposefully conservative and not all that unusual. They're not the ones that catch your eye when scanning the agate-type charts. The games played do.
