Ward, now 35, grew up in DeLisle, a rural town near Mississippi's coast that served as the basis for the setting in "Salvage the Bones." It is her lodestone; when I talk to her on the phone, she's there, staying at her mother's house. "People ask me about staying here. I think they assume that I wouldn't want to come back to a place like Mississippi, which is so backward and which frustrates me a lot," she says.

Luckily, the high-altitude, geostationary satellite rotating in sync with the Earth is not the Lady Mary’s only hope.

By the time the EPIRB aboard the Lady Mary activates at 5:40 a.m., the low earth-orbiting satellite is 20 minutes beyond her and just out of range.

"That's part of the equation," President Theo Epstein said. "He embraces the competitive aspects of the game and doesn't try to pretend it's just another day.

Then there's the integrity of the Christian religion -- already shredded, unfortunately, in the minds of many skeptical Americans. The extent of this thrashing, even among young people raised in the church, was documented last year in the influential book "unChristian: What a New Generation Really Thinks About Christianity ... and Why it Matters." Based on extensive polling by the respected (and Christian) Barna Research Group, the book details how young Americans tend to see Christianity debased by its attachment to right-wing politics and its seeming disinterest in the love and compassion parts of Christian teaching.

When Should Surgery Be Considered and What Is Involved? In many cases, the conditions causing spinal stenosis cannot be permanently altered by nonsurgical treatment, even though these measures may relieve pain for a period of time. To determine how much nonsurgical treatment will help, a doctor may recommend such treatment first. However, surgery might be considered immediately if a patient has numbness or weakness that interferes with walking, impaired bowel or bladder function, or other neurological involvement. The effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments, the extent of the patient's pain, and the patient's preferences may all factor into whether or not to have surgery. The purpose of surgery is to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves and restore and maintain alignment and strength of the spine.

Without playing the violin here, I was one of those whose family had been very wealthy until I was born. They sadly squandered most of what they'd acquired financially. In late 1938, 16 months after I was born, my father walked out one Sunday morning to get a newspaper and never returned, leaving my mother to raise me singularly the remainder of my pre-adult years. Those were in the pre-World War Two days and during that war, I became a 'latch-key" kid from age six until age 10, with my mother working for the War Department. She arrived home from work to the Projects in which we lived at about 9:30 every weeknight. She taught me how to open and heat cans of soup. Prior to her arrival I spent every night alone, listening to symphonies, other music-oriented programs, newscasts, serials and comedy shows on radio, and mostly in the dark. I chose the dark because it allowed me to more vividly see the fires belching from Pittsburgh's major steel mills below, manufacturing their products for the war effort. The memories are vivid. Little did I know they'd further craft any imagination or creativity within, but they did. I think those times, and the times that ensued during my teenage years in Queens and Manhattan, made me "tougher" than those who had been born into privilege and financial independence.

A new Outrigger initiative involves collecting the hotels' discarded newspapers and phone books.

Honolulu residents can put the boxes, which hold about a quart of used oil, into curbside bins, where the city then takes them to its H-Power plant for recycling into electric energy. The program prevents oil from clogging ("Hawaii Five-O" fans will appreciate that the program is called "Whoa! Fat").

NASA currently pays Russia to ferry crew and cargo to the space station.
In a sense, nearly all phones Americans buy are Chinese. They are, after all, assembled in China. The most valuable components, the chips, come from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the U.S. Huawei is linked to the same global phone manufacturing chain, buying the same chips and using the same factories for final assembly. The company's phones also look like other smartphones that are stylistically similar to the iPhone, and run Google Inc.'s popular Android software. What would really be different about the Huawei phones is that they're designed in China and marketed by a Chinese company.

A. Don't wait any longer to enjoy your new St. Augustine lawn. This grass seems to like the cooler months and makes lots of growth during the fall through spring seasons. Also, there are few pests at this time of the year and you can control the water to prevent root-rot problems. A severe winter could damage the grass but it would affect both new and established lawns similarly. Even when browned, the turf almost always regrows new shoots from runners close to the ground as the warmer weather returns.

The kitchen stuff wasn't so bad. "I actually do like to cook and do enjoy baking," Hutcherson says. "I know that sounds a bit contrived, but it is true.

But by 2011, the density had declined inexplicably to 202, with a low of just 23 fish per acre in the fall of 2008.
First up in the new series is an experimental brew Scarmana made, which he's calling Double Chocolate Belgian Quad. It's a beautifully opaque beer with a nose of chocolate-covered bananas. I could have smelled it all day without ever taking a sip, but I'm glad I tasted it, too. At 11 percent alcohol by volume, it's a massive, complex beer with low bitterness and sweet flavor from chocolate malts.

For me, the piece de resistance took the form of an order of sizzling stir-fried squid. Reputedly one of the most popular spicy dishes in Korean cuisine, ojingeo, as it is known, was served on a hot iron platter. Chile sauce imparted an extra burst of flavor on the calamari, carrots and zucchini while subsequently raising my internal thermostat. One complaint: too much time on the burner compromised some of the squid's tenderness.

James Loduca, a spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, on Gilead Sciences' HIV drug Truvada. The FDA's staff said in a report Tuesday that the pill is safe and effective when used to protect uninfected people from getting HIV.

All those blog posts about cancer weren't indexed just to make it easy for others. Lake plans to write a book about his experiences with cancer and with being a parent while having cancer.

It seems to him that most books by those with cancer are inspirational or written by women or both, and he wants to get as far away from that as he can.

Though Cox Cable and DirecTV have agreed to carry the Padres, Time Warner claims Fox' demands represent a 400 percent increase over the club's 2011 pricing and reports "not much progress" toward an agreement.

Spending money and time on a game series gives fans the false impression of "investment." The only thing the time and money gets you is entertainment. Everything else is at the whim of the creator.

Director Robert Kelley gathered an excellent cast -- including the dog -- and the amazing TheatreWorks team put together a fine set, lighting, costumes and sound; but the key to it is letting Steinbeck's story unfold on stage, in its many layers of meaning.

The SmartPark garages are among six the city owns downtown. The system generated controversy in 2010 after the Transportation Bureau chose a Tennessee company to manage day-to-day operations, drawing accusations of unfairness from two Portland bidders.

"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is aware of and monitoring reports of potentially suspicious items onboard cargo flights that landed safely at Newark Liberty and Philadelphia International airports," TSA spokeswoman Ann Davis said in a statement.

One recent study found that 93 percent of teens who were getting text messages about their medication said it changed - for the better - how they handled their asthma. Automated "robo" calls from pharmacists and doctors with reminders about taking medications and other health-related tips also work better than anything we've used before. Many of these services deliver a patient-education text, and it turns out that kids like to get that, too.
Moreover, the railroad said it cooperated with state investigators, noting that "fact disputes and disagreements are a part of every trial."
If he loses Tuesday, Lugar will become the latest Republican senator — though the first this year — to fall victim to a split within the GOP between the more pragmatic establishment and the conservative tea party factions. In 2010, tea party-backed Republicans unseated Utah Sen. Bob Bennett, and, in several states like Colorado and Delaware, overtook Senate candidates who were recruited or preferred by party leaders in Washington. The contentious primaries illustrated the fight for the direction of the Republican Party in the post-George W. Bush era.
The InterContinental boasts a top-drawer concierge staff to help guests get tickets and navigate the neighborhood. This is a chain signature, so I put a young man at the desk to the test.
Offline, you'll want to devote a drawer, safe or filing cabinet specifically for tax records.

What was nice about women in the workplace then, and it's similar right now, is that they weren't trying to be men, Kneen says. Even as women in pantsuits take hold in the later '60s, it wasn't in an oversized manly shape, although that would become more popular years later.
Obama's haul points to the fundraising advantages of incumbency and to the staggering cost of the coming election, which in this cycle will feature a new, powerful role for independent groups that can raise unlimited sums. Those groups could out-raise and outspend the parties and the candidates this year.
As long as Delta limits Economy Comfort to international flights, however, I suspect that smaller legacy airlines Alaska and Hawaiian can comfortably resist any changes. Still, Alaska should feel some competitive pressure from United, especially because Alaska's first-class cabins are so small that hardly any of its flyers, including high-ranking frequent flyers, have a good chance to escape the cattle car.

Feldbrugge deferred questions to Shoeberg, who said Monday he proposed the change because he thought it made sense to put a Washington County city under Washington County law enforcement. Landfall, a former private trailer park, previously contracted with Oakdale police and at one time even had a small force of its own. Landfall contracted with Maplewood in 1993.
The BRRG was accepted as the 50th member league of the WFTDA in December of 2007. There are a limited number of spots on the teams, so tryouts and practices can be intense. As Maggots says, “You’re my pal, but when it comes down to it, it’s either me or you.”
As it turns out, he didn't. Oh, certainly children will enjoy "Hugo," and their parents will, too. But what Scorsese has really made is a beautifully crafted love letter to movies, the passion of his life. What sounded like an odd pairing winds up being a perfect fit.
for a while now. Talk about playing music with her. Johnny Cash once said that music played by people who are related sounds better. And he should know since his wife was in the Carter family. I think Sara and I have an intuitive way of making music together.

We realized this when we heard a crash of dishes in the lower storage of that cabinet. We screamed for him to stop. He never apologized and he laughed it off. We inspected the damage as best we could, but were unable to move the cabinet because of its weight.
Mike Acker: The only reason I would say don’t try to move Babbitt is because I’m not sure how you could move him, or what team might want him. Luke might someday become a contributor, but Portland needs to get scoring off the bench, and Luke won’t be ready to contribute good minutes in 2011-12. Babbitt struggled to catch up with the pace of the NBA game, and he could benefit from more time in the D-League or in game situations where he can be successful and productive, but it might be in Portland’s best interest to let some other team try to develop him.
Although Uechi gained a big following for his fusion-tilted sushi, he's veering toward the more traditional at Kiwami, though you can, of course, get some of his best-known dishes, such as the crispy rice cake with spicy tuna, here as well. To hedge his bets (not a bad thing in these times), he's also offering some more substantial meat and seafood dishes.
Thats a lot of money, and Avril isnt fussing about making eight figures. But a multiyear contract, though it seems like a longshot for now, remains in the best interest of both parties.

Aaron looked on the bright side. "The trash is sometimes as colorful as the birds," he said.
Treasury said it was still examining selling securities with a floating interest rate rather than a fixed rate. It also said it continued to study selling securities that could be auctioned with negative yields, which essentially provide a means for investors to pay the government for the privilege of buying those securities.
And here's another thing that sets this particular Legacy apart: In this 2.5GT form, it can only be had with a manual transmission. In this case it's a short-throw six speed that felt quite satisfying. Stick shifts are becoming rarer these days, and I can't even remember the last time I got to manually row through the gears in a midsize sedan.
Defense attorneys Larry Pozner and David Lane said the Boulder DA probably wants to keep Karr in Los Angeles as long as possible. A judge in Los Angeles will conduct another hearing if Boulder authorities have not picked Karr up within 10 days.

I can't speak for the quality of the food, but how can you go wrong with a giant chicken on your roof? You can't.
The Zips made eight 3-pointers in 20 tries. That is an effective shooting percentage of 60 percent, because a team would have to make 12 of 20 2-point shots, or 60 percent, to score the same number of points.

“This is really the place I want to be,’’ Lopez said. “I was drafted here ... I love being a Net. It’s the only thing I know. I like everyone in the organization. I have good friends here. I’ve enjoyed my time in this area, and would have no objections at all to continuing to be here.’’
Though no physical evidence tied to Kyron's disappearance has been unearthed, searchers have uncovered evidence from unrelated crimes. They've found abandoned stolen vehicles, and discarded purses in the woods were tracked to an identity theft and burglary case from the late 1980s.
So even if chained to a computer, the monkeys might never generate words, let alone classic passages. The rules of probability don't apply in the same way they do to the theoretical or software monkeys, because these primates had their own preferences. "It questions the whole idea of animals as random generators," says Mike Phillips, professor of interdisciplinary arts at Plymouth, who led the research. "I think Shakespeare might be species-specific."
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland Browns and NFL fans, it's time for you to say who all of the teams should pick in the first round of the draft on April 26.
"I don't do anything lightly, and I am never surprised that when God calls me, it is to do more than I asked or thought," Bruno wrote in the letter. "The doctors are of a mind that we can beat this, but I want to be honest with you: I am frightened."
A: I'm a slow process filmmaker. Every time I make a movie, I demand a lot of time, especially because I try to make genre movies, but I add different elements as well to the genre stuff, which means time. It takes a lot of time to combine all of the elements that we put on the screen. It's a thriller, but on the other hand, I need to express very personal feelings in the movie, which means in terms of the writing process, it took a lot of time to finish the story, almost two years.
In fact, in the first week of January, he bought a plane ticket from Portland to Dallas, his hometown. The departure date was Feb. 17, the first day of the All-Star Break. The All-Star Game is Feb. 20 in Los Angeles.

A visit to these gardens is a treat for all the senses: the visual treat of the foliage and structures; the smell of the herbs and flowers; the sounds of birds and of leaves rustling in the breeze; the feel of the pathways under our feet and the sun on our faces.

Speed bump: It turned out the world was not waiting for a big-screen, big-budget, format-busting, live-action version of the two-bit Japanese cartoon series "Speed Racer." Despite being directed by the Wachowski brothers ("The Matrix"), and starring Emile Hirsch, Susan Sarandon and Christina Ricci, the movie was a box-office dud. Some critics and fans argued that the movie's highly stylized look was breaking boundaries and are salivating at how it'll look on Blu-ray. Now's their chance to find out, since this is available on conventional DVD and Blu-ray formats. Rated PG; 135 min. (135 minutes!? Sheesh!)
Dutrow's attorney, Mike Koenig, filed an appeal with the New York Supreme Court's Appellate Division in mid-March, arguing due process and rights violations because of an alleged conflict of interest on the part of New York Racing and Wagering Board chairman John Sabini, who is also secretary/president-elect of Racing Commissioners International.

It took some tugging to get them the next day to Monte Alban, the ancient pyramids of the once-mighty Zapotec empire. Boys who love exploring ruins in computer games are less enthused about the real thing. Once there, though, the underground tunnels delight.
Nelson and his brother own the old Eagle Mine, a once-prosperous gold mine that was opened in 1870 and ran continuously until the beginning of World War II in 1939.
Ngu Binh This is a fantasyland for fetishists of subtle textures. Almost every dish involves some substance made from rice flour, and the textures of these various rice products are subtly and radiantly distinct. Banh uot tom chay is sheets of supple rice noodle, wrapped around firm grains of ground shrimp. Banh bot loc tran is transparent rice flour dumplings wrapped around shrimp; the texture here is strange and ephemerally slippery, like a marriage between mochi and jellyfish. Don't forget to dip everything in nuoc mam, the bright orange fish sauce that comes with every dish.
The Justice Department would not comment on which automakers were affected by the conspiracy, how many models were affected and how much the price-fixing scheme inflated vehicle prices because the investigation continues. But Pozen said there's no doubt consumers were hurt financially.
That worked out fine, live on Saturday night, and on Monday morning we got a request from the National Cartoonists Society for the phone numbers of Siegel and Shuster. The Society was going to threaten to strike if Superman's original creators did not get a piece of the action. Eventually -- and I want to believe Mickey and I had a part in this -- Siegel and Shuster each got $20,000 a year for life.
And finally, it is Sink herself who is the answer to the trivia question at the top about Siamese twins. Yes, I know the proper term is "conjoined." But these guys actually were from Siam (now Thailand) originally. North Carolina's Chang and Eng Bunker were the nation's first, settling near Mount Airy, N.C. (better known as Mayberry to you Andy Griffith fans). Chang and Eng married two sisters and had 21 children between them — one of them Sink's grandmother.
PLAINFIELD — Each passing day, every grim clue and unanswered phone call has seeped the last strands of hope from Veronica Ramessar.
In internal memos circulated last fall, officials in the state's attorney's and sheriff's offices discussed detective Douglas Epperson's descriptions of the questioning in the murder case of Jeremiah P. DeMario, who was killed in 2010. Charges in that case were dropped because of other problems with evidence, but concerns about Epperson's conduct wound up leading the state to withdraw reckless-endangerment counts in the separate death of Isaiah Simmons at the youth academy. Epperson was lead investigator in both cases.
