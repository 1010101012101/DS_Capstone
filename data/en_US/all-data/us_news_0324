I think the real controversy isn't about the pipeline itself, because we have lots of oil pipelines in the United States. The real opposition is to the oil sands themselves. And it's an argument about carbon. It is a tough issue for the administration because environmentalists are part of their base. But it may be the biggest shovel-ready project in the country if you take direct and indirect jobs. It's hard in an environment with 9 percent unemployment to say no to it.

He claims to be keeping a promise to himself and his wife in deciding not to run. My observation is he could not win if he tried.

This, too, goes with the territory. Part of a general manager's job is to convey a vision that creates hope and moves tickets, to paint pretty pictures until his team is capable of its own artistry. That job is made doubly difficult in San Diego by payroll constraints and perpetual churn, by fire sales and patchwork rosters.
"These guys have been the story for us from day one, and I don't think it's fair for either guy to get away from things, to allow a guy to get off his game," Hitchcock said.

We need him playing well. We need him with some starts, just like Brian. My tough decision comes in a couple weeks, so I'll make it then. But I think both guys playing is healthy for our team."

Another friend delivered the speech: the Rev. Robbie Fahnestock. We met in 1975, and at the time, he had problems with drugs, alcohol, gambling, money, sex and food. Anything that led to obsessive, compulsive behavior, Robbie abused. His high school class voted him most likely to be found comatose in a motel.

This is a cut of beef from the shoulder area, often heavily marbled and loaded with flavor. We are seeing it more and more at upscale eateries because the price tends to be lower than more-common cuts like a rib-eye or New York strip. In the hands of a highly skilled chef, this is a great chance to show off. I'm reminded of an exceptional "bavette" steak at Ravenous Cafe, for instance, that was a revelation  tender and bursting with the best kind of beefy flavor.

I am one of the first liberals to admit I voted for Proposition C because I have seen my private insurance rates go up twice in the past year so don't give me this baloney that if everybody buys health insurance our rates will go down. If anyone has seen Frontline they will know that the Obama Administration cut a deal with the insurance industry because Rahmbo was too chicken to go against the insurance lobby. I also feel bad for working class people who can barely afford to get buy right now so now they got another bill, thanks Obama. I would have preferred that we go to the public option since it will keep the insurance companies honest and maybe take the health care costs away from businesses (large and small) so we can be competitive in this global economy since other countries in the world provide coverage for their people. I'm sure if your some narrow minded conservative you probably are going to say that this going to raise our taxes but isn't increase health care costs another form of increasing taxes.

Most foreigners were allowed to leave the country, but the French were forced to surrender the Cambodians, including Schanberg's research assistant Dith Pran, to all but certain death.

Adam Dunn, White Sox: He has improved markedly since last season, when he hit a mind-boggling .159 with 177 strikeouts in 415 at bats and looked like a guy the team pulled out of the crowd.

Like they say in sports: If you have to lose, you always want it to be to the eventual champion. I never heard from her again, but during that phone call, she told me that if I had proposed, she would have accepted. I didn't quite believe it because she was seeing two guys at the time.

In his directorial debut, Michael Brandt (he also co-wrote the screenplay) doesn't know how to add menace or mystery to the proceedings, so the movie just plods ahead without a sense of momentum.

In Jialin Tian's "Macaron Magic" (Jayca, $17.95), she introduces readers to a world of exotic, brightly colored Parisian macarons. Most of her fanciful creations begin with two basic recipes, for shells and Swiss Meringue Buttercream. By adding color and flavorings, she creates magic. Italian meringue is an essential component of the shells, but because it's hard to make the meringue in a stand mixer with one or two egg whites, Tian uses four, which makes enough shells for about 90 macarons. (Hey, they are small, and they freeze well.) If this seems like a lot of work, pace yourself. Make the fillings one day, shells the next. To add variety, we divided the batter and the Swiss Meringue Buttercream in half to create Meyer lemon and rose water-scented macarons. We dyed the shells bright yellow for the Meyer lemon and a pretty rose pink for the rose water. Finally, we couldn't help but strut our Southern-ness by adding pecans to the shells, and bourbon to the ganache.

3. Today (Oct. 19) is the fifth anniversary of the curveball that froze New York City. OK, well, it just froze Carlos Beltran. But the city felt it's chill. On this same date back in 2006, rookie Adam Wainwright faced Beltran with the bases loaded and the pennant on the line. Wainwright fired a first-pitch changeup and then a final-pitch curveball. Beltran took the hook for a called third strike and the Cardinals won the pennant. They went on to win the World Series against Detroit. Where are the principles in that moment now? Beltran is about to become a free agent after finishing the season with the San Francisco Giants. Yadier Molina, the catcher who called the sequence of pitches, is getting ready for Game 1 of his third World Series appearance. Wainwright, meanwhile, threw a bullpen on Tuesday and is continuing a steady return from Tommy John surgery. He has yet to try that curveball, though he is encouraged by the movement on his sinker because of the extension he's able to get with his rebuilt joint. Wainwright is joining Bruce Sutter and Bob Gibson to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. They are the last three Cardinals to finish a World Series with a strike out.

His 30 rebounds came in the Lakers’ most impressive regular-season victory at San Antonio while Bryant was injured. Now his 10 blocked shots were delivered in the Lakers’ playoff tone-setter – and the only real piece of news to come out of that opener against an unready, inexperienced Denver team was Bynum so embracing the pivotal defensive aspect of his job description.
We aren't trying to challenge our guests and we aren't laying down a gauntlet. There won't be any preaching at the tables, though our servers will be happy to answer questions about what we are doing here and why. But we figured, why limit ourselves to local meat and produce? So we are challenging ourselves. We may change things a little as time goes by, but we wanted to do this.

Similarly, inadequate nutrition in pregnant women is the cause of many congenital abnormalities among infants; parasitic infections reduce the nutrition available intrauterine for fetal development. It is true that some of these congenital abnormalities can be corrected postpartum (Operation Smile and Smile Train are two organizations that give plastic surgeries to correct congenital deformities in low-income countries), but surgery is a more costly and inferior solution to prevention. Improving the diets of pregnant women by reducing infections is a much better response. Reducing parasitic predations avoids the later pain and suffering of children and parents, and also is much cheaper than surgery.
The month of October has been dedicated to increasing awareness about the importance of the early detection of breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, because of improvements in treatment and early detection, millions of women are surviving breast cancer today.
2. Got to admit, I thought Chris Volstad was going to be better than he’s been so far. He’s 0-3 and the Cubs have lost all four of his starts, and on Wednesday one of his old bugaboos returned. Volstad was prone to serving up home runs with Florida, and David Freese’s 2-run shot in the sixth inning turned a good outing into a bad one. The plus side is that he pitched well enough to take a 2-1 lead into the sixth, but still, his April is over and he’s stuck with a 6.14 ERA. It’s too soon to reach any conclusions -- especially given a strikeout-walk ratio of 4-1 -- but he hasn’t been the guy in cold weather that he was in Arizona, and that’s disappointing. He’ll be severely tested in his next outing, Monday in Cincinnati. It will be the first of his career at Great American Ball Park.
For someone running for secular office, the former Pennsylvania senator has expressed a lot of thoughts about Catholicism, Christianity and religion in general, but even his supporters must have been surprised when he denounced President Obama as embracing a "phony theology" during a recent campaign appearance in Ohio. A spokesman explained that Mr. Santorum believes the president to be Christian but that his political ideology was discredited because it would deny individual rights in favor of government control.
The Buffalo Sabres didn't just miss the playoffs on the final day of the regular season, they missed a legitimate title shot. Two years ago, Philadelphia got in by the hair of Claude Giroux's overtime shootout goal in the season finale. A few weeks later, the Flyers were in the finals, losing in six games to Chicago.
Reid and other top Democratic senators met with Obama at the White House at mid-afternoon, and congressional aides said the topic was the end-of-year legislation.
Tuesday is Election Day, and despite the growing popularity of early voting in Ohio, that remains a very special civic celebration. There is something inspiring about trekking to the polls on a crisp November day, seeing your neighbors and participating in the democratic rite of decision. One caution: Since some precinct boundaries and polling places have been changed since last November, you might want to double-check your location before heading out Tuesday.
Since then, they've contributed to each other's films — Tsangari helped produced both "Dogtooth" and Lanthimos' new film, "Alps," and he appears as an actor in "Attenberg."

Hard to say with the world or Wall Street, but at least Hollywood gives a few clues: It always stakes out release dates early, particularly for big films. (So, just in case you care: Keep March 12, 2012 open, for “Dr. Seuss’ ‘The Lorax.’”)
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Plain Dealer staffers walked away with top honors in the categories of informational and illustrative graphics in the 2012 National Headliner Awards.
It also helps that the Monsters have proven to be a good feeder system. Last season, alone, Lake Erie sent 14 players to the Avalanche, who surprised many and made the playoffs under first-year coach Joe Sacco. Sacco coached the Monsters for their first two seasons before being promoted; David Quinn replaced him in Cleveland.
"The threat was very real," said Oregon's FBI Special Agent in Charge Arthur Balizan. "Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale. At the same time, I want to reassure the people of this community that, every turn, we denied him the ability to actually carry out the attack."

eatery, you'll look up to find your waiter holding a microphone and belting out some of your favorite songs. Two of the waiters on the day we were there are former "American Idol" finalists. Themed entrees, such as the Cheese Release Me grilled cheese or the Love Me Tender fried steak, are cooked in an open kitchen, but the highlight for us was the full-service soda fountain. Our ($9.99) brownie sundae was so big the six of us couldn't finish it. It was crowded on the March day we went, and we hear that long waits out the door are common in summer months.

OK, Pekes have their issues. Lots of them. They are brachycephalic, meaning they don't have a normal dog jaw. Ever looked in the mouth of a Pekingese? The teeth are crammed in there in a sort of mish-mash of disarray. The dogs' muzzles are nearly flat, and they have a ton of eye problems, many caused by the big skin folds in front of their eyes, which can sometimes irritate the eyeball.

Under the new proposal, racino gambling would be permitted only at Canterbury Park in Shakopee and part of the proceeds would go into a "multi-stadium revenue fund" that would help build not only a $1 billion Vikings stadium but also a new $50 million ballpark for the St. Paul Saints in downtown St. Paul. Hackbarth said that, after the two stadiums were funded, the money might be used to build other large infrastructure projects in Minnesota.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Maybe Rutgers had simply used up its good fortune for the season in the first six games.

Showalter has organized the book by decades, beginning in 1650, when Anne Bradstreet, a settler from England in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, wrote the first book by a woman living in America. Bradstreet's "The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America" is a collection of poems describing the difficulties and joys of being a settler, wife and mother. It was published in London and required no fewer than 11 testimonials by male friends, family and critics to convince the publisher that it was indeed written by a woman and worthy of publication. It was followed by Mary Rowlandson's 1682 memoir of her abduction by Narragansett Indians, "A True History of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson." It was in this genre, "captivity narratives," that American women first distinguished themselves as writers.

Memories of the quake are still sharp among those who were there.

Yet consumers are benefiting. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan is 4.79 percent, barely above the record of 4.71 percent. And 15-year loans are at their lowest level on record.

Context is everything in life. Taking a few steps will bring tears to a man's eyes if he thought he would never walk again. Wedding cake tastes different if the groom never showed.
