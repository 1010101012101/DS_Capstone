We all will be surprised by the impact that generosity has both on us, as well as the others we bless. The way out of ourselves, is by investing into the lives of others. Take advantage of the opportunities to be generous this Holiday Season. May our generosity be gauged by the degree of Christ’s generosity to us!
Then I write the last line first. From a workshop by the Harlequin author Molly O’Keefe, I got the concept that the entire book hurtles toward the last line. By writing the last line first, I would get the “theme” or message for my book. Here’s an example: “But happiness waited for them both here. Here—where they had found home.” This story will be about a couple not only falling in love, but also finding out where they belong in the world.
“God loveth a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7 KJV). How is this verse reflected in verse two of Chapter 25? (“Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to receive the offering for me from each man whose heart prompts him to give.” (Exodus 25:2 NIV))
This magnetic chest plate becomes the beginning of the Iron Man as Tony designs the first crude Iron Man suit in the cave, seeing it as his only way out, and still refusing to build the missile they want him to build. Tony does escape, using his iron suit to fly and fight his way out, and he lands rather hard and ungracefully in the dessert.

I used stamps from Owly Hoo, Crafty Friends and Scripture Sayings to decorate the rattles . . . not exactly the first stamp sets you would think of when doing a baby card, right? That is my point! You can find SO MUCH MORE to use these stamps with when you look outside of the "themes" on the sets!
Today, women are being raped and molested at the drop of a pin. In the villages, in towns and in cities, children, little girls and women are being disrobed for lust, for jealousy, for enmity, for god knows what other unjustifiable reason. Mothers watch their children being raped by their fathers. Excuse me for sounding violent but shouldn’t the mother be doing a Bobbitt if not murder? The kind of trauma that children undergo when they are physically violated is just indescribable. Gandhari, the mother of the Kauravas allowed her sons to get away with molestation and cheating. All because she was a mother. Wasn’t she a woman first? But no, she too like her blind husband wanted to close her eyes to any injustice that her children did. God gave her an intellect and eyes to discern and judge right from wrong but she chose to put herself in the illusionary tower of spoilt maternal emotion. No wonder we have spoilt brats even today, who do not even hesitate to lay their villainous hands on just any woman and run their cars over sleeping people on the pavement.

Who is to judge if a food culture is good or bad? Is it fair to compare food cultures? Setting one culture up against another? I don’t believe so. Because every distinguishable food culture has its origins and is driven by certain factors. The main factors being the people and the ingredients available. I’ll start my culinary thought journey with a culture that has developed in just 500 years, and ending it in a country which still enjoys a bright star all around the culinary interested world – France.

FOR THE POLISHED APPLES:
Some history from the back cover which may be of interest:
Losing my father when I was twenty two was not only excruciating but I was totally oblivious to the stages of grief. I focused on the pain of my younger siblings and my mother and drove full throttle into life thinking all I needed was a brand new sports car purchased with inheritance money to do it. Wow, was I wrong. My body basically shut down with daily migraines and I was just stuck. During a visit to the doctor’s office, she asked me “Have you grieved the loss of your dad?” I must have looked at her with a blank stare because she answered for me, “I don’t think so”. So I finally allowed the pain to touch me, punch me, kick me and the tears flowed for weeks, or months. There were no more migraines and I became more aware of the steps to getting my life back. I had already completed the anger stage. Check! I brought that one right to the funeral home with me. I distinctly remember cursing him out, under my breath for leaving me so early in my life. Lack of maturity was only part of that, the rest is just about a daughter who never thought she was good enough. I needed more time to prove him wrong….or prove myself wrong.

LA: Once I want to go for a project, I call an acquisition's meeting, which is a phone conference where I will present 1 to 4 titles to my boss and a few other board members, discuss what the book is and why I want to go after it. I've only been turned down at this stage maybe four times in 100 books, which is a testament both to their trust in me but also that we've been a team for six years now and have a pretty good understanding of what it is we're going for with the line. Once approval has been given, I email or phone the agent with an offer and negotiations start. This is a boring, tedious process and not worth going into here. Then the book goes into production and we put an illustrator on the cover and the fun starts. Having been at this for six years now, I've obviously seen plenty of books that I either passed on or was outbid on come out from other houses (as has everyone). I'm very proud that when I've tracked their performance, I've been pretty accurate in my judgment as to how the books I've passed on would do, and also right about how good the ones that got away were.

Having studied Medieval history, I am of course inclined to find coins of the Middle Ages. My scope is not limited to historical artifacts, though. Ancient, Medieval, Modern, whatever it may be, I would very much like to see, hold, and inspect the elements and designs of any coin. Coins provide an insight into the perceptions and lives of those who use them. The designs, the mottos, the materials, all are indicators of the civilization to which they belong. Being able to look at such items, to study them, or just to enjoy the aesthetics of them, is a pleasure.
I've been on a bit of a non-poetry reading frenzy lately which began with the following three Plath books I was sent: Bitter Fame by Anne Stevenson, The Haunting of Sylvia Plath by Jacqueline Rose and The Silent Woman by Janet Malcolm. The most interesting, for me, was the Rose book. There was much more of a focus on Plath's poems in it including some stuff I hadn't previously read much about such as the possible influence of cinema films on Plath's work, more on the influence of African folklore, and a rather extensive almost Freudian-like emphasis on sexuality in the interpretation of many Plath's poems. The infamous Bitter Fame was a pretty dull read and the Malcolm book offered an interesting perspective on the history and difficulties facing Plath biographiers.

The morning was still windy, but not terrible. We hiked about ten miles to Scizzor’s Crossing and then took siesta under the overpass, napping, reading, and cooking lunch. The trail angel filling up the cache there told us that a whopping 105 hikers went through Scizzors the day before so we shouldn’t depend on the third gate cache, meaning our next guaranteed water was 25 miles ahead. We filled to capacity.

The Wild Hop IPA was originally showcased in cask form at last October's Wetherspoons Real Ale festival. It's a very well hopped golden ale that thinks it's an IPA. It uses a variety of U.S. and U.K. hops and it's an interesting and aggressive beast that screams with coarse orange and grapefruit bitterness that carries through to a slightly abrasive finish. I found it a beer that lacked balance. It was tasty and fairly refreshing beer but I found that it lacked balance. There was too much hop action going on that it overwhelmed what malt backbone there was. Others have really enjoyed this beer because of the big hop profile and normally this would be something that I would be looking for too but with this beer it doesn't quite pull it off.

March feels a bit less busy than February in some ways. But all of my formerly postponed tasks have been re-prioritized so I am really just as swamped. My on-campus hours have eased up a bit which is nice. Next month brings my birthday, the end of the term, and travel to San Diego. I have never visited this city and will be staying in Little Italy (which feels fitting as a current resident of Pittsburgh's Little Italy) so bring on the restaurant, sight-seeing, and shopping suggestions! I will be there for a conference but hope to also have some fun.

I’ve asked about hygiene and seasoning. Doesn’t this increase the chances that microscopic critters and such survive the meal and wait, lurking, for the chance to hitch a ride on some asparagus stir-fry and wage atomic warfare on my small intestines? I have been assured this is not the case, and while I’m usually a Sap for Science, I didn’t pay attention in the class that followed on why seasoning is safe and even desirable (something something about iron content increasing in your food as it stays in contact with the skillet, etc.)

I doubt the owners of Fresh Market are aware of the nuances inherent in the missing sign.

There is something profound about our job. Junk removal. On the surface it is what it is. We go to people’s homes, mostly, and we get rid of their unwanted stuff. Old couches, reffridgerators, TV sets, bathtubs, yard waste, washers, dryers, cardboard boxes, desks, wardrobes, clothes; the list goes on and on. Think of something you have at your house, we have probably thrown it away.

But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can’t entirely explain. He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.
To learn to notice when the beginnings of that resistance are being felt, to learn to let that sense of resistance go….to practice noticing and remembering that…over and over again…practicing, practicing, practicing….to keep reminding ourselves of that dynamic.

This weekend we went to Cascade Mountain, a really amazing ski resort. We arrived Saturday morning and skied the whole day. My neck is really sore from all the fun!! We stayed overnight at a hotel and ate breakfast there. Now we are all back home. I did all but one of the green hills (easiest), two blue hills (harder), and 1 black diamond (hardest). I ended up getting stuck and having to scoot down one of the blue hills on my bottom. It was really funny. How was your weekends?
More than ever it is critical to a film’s credentials to get the soundtrack right. A stellar list including Muse, Paramore and Linkin Park were enlisted for Twighlight’s official release. Aside from being a highly useful aid to visual cues as previously mentioned, a quality score has the potential to be highly profitable as well. According to Amazon, the soundtracks to ‘The Bodyguard’ and ‘Saturday Night Fever’ have sold more than 15 million units apiece (as well as providing a more than useful platform for one Whitney Houston, obviously). To put this in perspective, ‘The Eminem Show’ was the best selling album for the United States for the year it was released. It sold approximately 7.6 million units.

Opening up a Japanese crochet book can be a bit daunting. You flip through the first half of the book see all of these beautiful styled photos, want to make everything and then come to the second half of the book and realise all of the instructions are in Japanese. Not a problem. All of the books and magazines I have seen have wonderful diagrams which explain the stitches. The crochet symbols that are used are exactly the same symbols as those use in English crochet books or magazines, such as Crochet Today.
I had an idea that the Ikea linen curtain also lends itself to being a really good fabric for cross-stitch (I used to do it a bit back in the '80's) and I found this really cute pattern for a tapestry wallet in an 1863 La Mode, of a Cherub with a garland of flowers, and have spent the last couple of days working in Excel to get a feel for the look and the colours of it.

I have been thinking about writing but am not feeling writerly. You can blame a few changes at work. You can't, however, blame my nearly losing my fingertip 3 weeks ago. THAT was an incredibly lame accident involving a construction trailer at work, a badly set lock with a backwards bolt, some mysterious cause of slamming door (which may have been my knee and may have been a defective door closer) and my fingertip half ripped off. Literally. Half. Ripped off. From one side of the nail to the other side of the finger. And between 1/4 and 1/2 an inch of bone was exposed along the side where the bolt caught me. Voila! A huge flap of skin was accordian folded to the tip of my finger that was crushed in the bolt. Bolt holes are small and it hurts when you get your finger LOCKED in one.

“Plus, there is no guarantee that jobs created from pipelines will be safe, well-paying, and permanent.

Last year, the Petroleum Human Resources Council sought an additional 100,000 migrant workers to work on tarsands infrastructure.

That’s the bad news. The good news is that we’re not helpless. We can fight back against these methods of shackling our right-brain with our own ways of liberating it. One of those is to avoid fluoride in water and toothpaste; hopefully we can do this while our pineal gland is still working and so prevent complete calcification. Minimize your use of mobile phones; Ian holds them up the left side of his head as a placebo! Don’t watch TV, or at least take everything you see on it with a pinch of salt. Refuse vaccinations for your child, and don’t let them be medicated with Ritalin or Junior Prozac. Another means that is not advisable except in a controlled environment is sleep deprivation. I remember seeing a news story just a few days before coming to Shift 2 about a Cornishman who’d just broken the record for the longest time without sleep: 11 days. He was interviewed at the end of it, looking pretty haggard, but still able to coherently answer the reporter’s questions. Ian told us about a friend of his in Cornwall called Tony Wright, who’d written a book called Left in the Dark about how he’d achieved right-brain awareness through staying awake for a few nights and not sleeping. I wondered if they were both the same person, and it turns out that they are; see: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6690485.stm. Sleep is something we specifically need for the left-brain, the right-brain never sleeps, which is why dreams come from the right-brain while the left-brain is kipping. Forcing the left-brain to shut down by starving it of sleep, while you’re still awake, is a good way of experiencing the right-brain’s consciousness. It is in this state of consciousness that we can fully harness the right-brain’s power, which is why then we are hit by things like synchronicity and premonitions and the ability to manifest the physical world around us. This happened to me once during a very busy period of work at my hospital. I did 5 double shifts in as many days and had a major incident during one of them. I remember going to the toilet at three AM and hearing voices calling my name in the cubicle, and when I turned on the tap on the washbasin I saw faces in the water smiling at me.

“As comics readers gazing own from a higher dimension perpendicular to the page surface, we can actually peer inside characters’ thoughts with balloons or captions that provide running commentary.. We can also control time in a comics universe. We can stop on page 12 and look back to page 5 to check a story point we missed. The characters themselves continue to act out their own dramas in the same linear sequence, oblivious to our shifting perspective. They can go back in time only with the help of supermachines, like the Flash’s cosmic treadmill, but we can look at 1938 Superman next to 1999 Superman without colliding the two stories anywhere but in our heads.”

1) Exercise. If a dog is properly exercised, the occurrences of obsessive barking are almost entirely eliminated. Walking, jogging, or biking with your dog are the best ways to exercise since they help you relate side-to-side with your dog (which is extremely important to all canines). Other exercise forms would be fetching, a trip to the dog park, fetching up and down the stairs, or having your dog learn to ride a treadmill. I recommend at least a 30 minute walk twice a day for a barker (you can read about mastering the walk here).
With a national debt of $14 trillion, gasoline at or above $4 a gallon, and the cost of everything rising, it is astonishing to think that Americans today spend an estimated $45.4 billion annually on their cats, dogs, birds, and other pets.
Yet, for some reason, you are out there protesting Israel (the most ‘gay friendly’ country in the Middle East) and supporting Palestine (who is controlled by Hamas, who I already pointed out would happily murder you).

I went searching for the perfect tent, and I found it. It's Christmas tree shaped, in shades of green. And it even comes with its own angel on top.
But then again, I guess life itself is unexpected. You can't ever really expect anything, because it will no doubt change or differ in ways you didn't think possible.

Your feedback on the mantle was amazing (I'm in the process of implementing some of the clever ideas, with my own quirkiness tossed in) so I'm soliciting your opinions again. Photographing the DIY tablecloth the other day, I really couldn't ignore what has long bugged me: a dead space in the dining room. I put a plant stand there, but plan on murdering those plants (it's more humane than the slow death they are now enduring) . . .

These ugly fuckers came from Asia. They've attacked our tomatoes. They are attacking our sunflowers. They have swarmed our siding and are looking for cracks to invade our home. The weather outside is perfect and I have to turn on the air conditioning.
I got up, put the running garb on and stepped outside. Into 34 degree windy weather. Geez, just yesterday afternoon it was in the 70s. The HIGH 70s! Today was supposed to get into the mid to high 60s, but 34 degrees? Really?!

I have to admit I was a little shocked. I mean, when we'd started planning the wedding we originally talked about spending only $5000. However we had absolutely no idea how much various things costs, and we knew exactly what we wanted, and where we wanted it to be.

There's a technique I use when I'm going through a difficult situation, or want to achieve something new in my life, which is to accept the fact that my current situation will change, because ultimately it can’t not. Even the mighty Roman Empire vanished into the dust of history. Once I have meditated on this and truly accepted that change is inevitable, then it's just a matter of negotiating the point in time when that change is going to happen. In my mind, it’s no longer a question of if, but when.

Stephan Douglas accused Lincoln of wanting to “impose on the nation a uniformity of local laws and institutions and a moral homogeneity dictated by the central government” that would “place at defiance the intentions of the republic’s founders.” Oh how he was right! Lincoln must be please by the way he’s making the founding fathers roll in their respective graves. The 9th and 10th Amendments exist for a reason. It’s time we return to individual liberty, individual responsibility, the limited-government principles of the Constitution, and rule of law.

Of course, it’s not all bad news; many people – female and male – have very positive retirement plans. But, as the article indicates and my own experience with coaching and advising older people bears out, many individuals simply don’t talk to each other in any meaningful way about retirement beyond a shared acknowledgement that it will be good to leave the rat race behind.

Once we had toasted the Rose, our party headed across the street to the trusty ol' Le Garde Robe wine bar for a bit more BN guzzling. The wines on offer from the makeshift kerb-side counter were excellent - defying ten years worth of experience with BNs which were, in retrospect, undrinkable.

She is like a forest creature, wild and free. Warrior trained along side her brothers. She guards the life and spirit of the forests that surround them, as well as those who live in the valley with them. She also guards a secret, for she is more than just a simple Elven maiden tending to the care of the elements they live in. Within her lives the talent to communicate with the very trees she treats, they tell her tales, stories, tidings of things that have passed. To them she is their guardian. To them she is Tratchar, she who heals their ills, beloved of the Sentinels and their salvation. Beautiful and proud she is no man’s possession, nor shall she be, this she is determined she will never be.

Thirdly, and this may be the most important, the Psalmist reminds us of the location or the seat of our hope and joy. Again, contrary to human wisdom, we are reminded that true joy, happiness and hope comes from within. It’s in our hearts. You can take my home. You can take my health. You can take my career and my financial stability. But you can’t take what’s inside me.

Edward Gibbon saw the battle of Poitiers in France in 732 as a key turning point in European history. Had the Muslims won at Poitiers, “the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.”

Dr. C really cares about Beth. She keeps trying to keep her alive long enough to get better. I stayed in the waiting room because even though the Dr. is good I doubt Beth's motives. Somehow the suboxone gets lost or stolen etc. etc. The Dr. knows that I quit paying for this treatment long ago because of this behavior. She continues to treat Beth when she begs to come back even without the copayments. Beth once attained almost three months clean with this Dr. It was the best she ever did in or out of rehab.

Sometimes I read books like this, and I wonder if I’m just missing the joke. Like, maybe if I had some English degree from some liberal arts university, that I’d “get” it and swoon over what Lipsyte is saying about culture. And what a great satirist he is. I wonder if I sat and thought about the book for hours, would I draw conclusions about Purdy and Bernie and Milo and Maura and all the other pathetic characters in the book? I probably could. I used to do that when I took mandatory English classes at my liberal arts university. But you know what? Now, I read for pleasure. And I just don’t give a shit about these people.

This movie has such an interesting story and we can all relate to it. Who hasn’t been through a messy break-up they would love to forget. Who hasn’t lost a loved one and been overwhelmed by the grief and heartache? When Carrey’s character finds out what his ex has done it hurts him, he feels the pain of that loss and can’t live with it. He decides to go through the same procedure and realizes in the middle of it that he made a horrible mistake. When we exit relationships the reasons for the break-up are the freshest things on our mind and it seems like erasing them would be an easy decision. It comes with a cost though, Carrey soon gets to the memories that made him fall in love with Winslet and he isn’t willing to sacrifice those. He desperately does everything he can in order to save the love of his life from being erased but ultimately fails, sort of. I think the overall theme of the movie is that true love finds a way, and it does as we see. Sometimes certain people belong together. Relationships are a rocky business and they can sometimes take all our strength to persevere. I think it takes an understanding of that in order to make a relationship work, and all too often people aren’t lucky enough to figure it out.

It's always a dangerous season. The walk into the forest happens at roughly the same time each year, when tall spindly giants shed their golden, auburn, and scarlet locks to form a crisp, cushioned and comforting welcome mat under your feet. And so, you may enter with a spring in your step.

I’m extremely lucky that writing has become my day job, for the time being at least. So once I have the house to myself around 7.30am, the first couple of hours are spent on the settee with my laptop and a snoring dog by my side. I work best during those first couple of hours. If I’m mid draft, rewrite or edit, I’ll continue through until 4 o’clock-ish. If I’m near to the end of a draft, I can work on it from 7.30am until I go to bed, stopping only when I have to until it’s finished. I love that feeling when my characters don’t want to stop talking.

To those cretins who proclaim such an idea is socialism, I reply they are too late. Socialism is rife among the fortunate; it is merely those left out who have yet to commit this supposed sin.

While the intervals were not as fast as my best work, they were a lot closer to what I wanted than any other recent speed work has been. The ten quarter miles ranged from 1:58 to 2:02. The corresponding paces ranged from 7:52 to 8:08. I did a 1:30 recovery between intervals (except for the last two) and 2:30 after the sixth.

Initially, the separation between what Thrall is and what she’d prefer him to be was more stark. We had less details. The storytellers then opted to steer us toward the Aggra Concept of Go’el by giving us glimpses of Thrall’s fears, desires, and doubts through the Elemental Bonds questline in Patch 4.2. Here, we were shown that Thrall apparently does desire A) a mate, B) a family, and C) to lay down his arms and have peace with his enemies. There has been little to no mention of any of this prior to patch 4.2. Yes, that’s 6+ years of Thrall without any such in-depth exploration of his character.

When I first started decorative painting in 2000, I went berserk buying all the latest paints, brushes ... and surfaces. I can't tell you how many surfaces that I still have - that at the time I felt was "too good to mess up" with my beginner painting skills.

The gig was a success (well I think it was). The stage was plenty large enough for me although the large groups were a bit cramped on there. The sound was good with a couple of good sound guys who just efficiently got on with the job and delivered really good results - impressive given the range of groups and solo artists. Everything was running late - I never really knew why, it was already late when we got there in the middle of the afternoon, due to that I had to cut to a set of about 30mins - I was pleased with how I did that on a personal level, i.e. calmly and evenly.

And you can see this when you look at somebody.
When considering how our bodies, Deleuze connects psychoanalysis interpretations of behavior and how they are used in such a way to be repressive. One of the ways in which Deleuze discusses desire is through sexuality, or what is considered a sexual deviance such as Masochism. To Deleuze, the psychoanalytic interpretation of Masochism is flawed. What it describes is only as a bizarre way in which to achieve pleasure. A way in which pain wards off anxiety and reaches a climax, or a way in which there is simply a goal and certain self-prescribed means to reach that goal. This viewpoint, for Deleuze, is a large oversight to the real purpose of Masochism as a behavior, to sustain the journey toward pleasure. It is the desire itself that the masochist finds fulfilling rather than an end goal or conclusion of that desire. He sums up this idea by saying “the masochist’s suffering is the price he must pay, not to achieve pleasure, but to untie the pseudobond between desire and pleasure as an extrinsic measure. (Deleuze and Guatarri, p.155)” Pleasure must be delayed as long as possible because receiving it only “interrupts the continuous process of positive desire. (Deleuze and Guattari, p.155). In this sense, pleasure is attributed as the end point of desire, and so, prolonging its arrival achieves immanence of desire , or what Deleuze calls the plane of consistency specific to desire (Deleuze and Guattari, p.154).

Omer Arbel - Difficult question that I usually leave critics to answer. There are certain objectives and obsessions that I can track through our work, but as with anything, an insider's view can only be that - an insider's view... with its "built in" biases and blind spots. I think our work is Romantic - I mean this not in the contemporary sense of the word - but rather in the 18th century sense of the word, stemming from Romanticism. We believe in the enigmatic emotional potential of objects and spaces... and we aim to focus and amplify this potential in our work.

I suppose if I were going to say anything about what I’ve learned it would be this: It isn’t easy, some of it is down to good luck (assuming you have the writing skills in place). Finding someone who loves your work is the best good fortune and you have to do it twice if you want to land an agent and then a publisher. So your story has to be different and the best it can be.

“We started by looking at a picture of a village in Kenya where Akido lives. We thought about the ways in which it was different to where most of the children live in Portsmouth. The children came up with lots of differences: the colour of the houses, lots of chickens, goats and cows. They also noticed that some things were the same: Akido has a pet dog, just like some of the children, and lives with his mummy. The main activity was to think about how far away it was to get to Kenya – so we all put our coats on and imagined we went on an adventure. Kenya is a very long way away, so to get there we had to:

Osama bin Laden took more than American lives that fateful day in 2001. He took something deeper; he took our sense of infallability. But yesterday our fine military - the best in the world - reminded us "that you can hit us, you can knock us down, but we're gonna get up and when we do, we're gonna find you and kick your ass!" Some may lament the 'eye for an eye' attitude, but sometimes that is exactly what is called for (no small irony that he actually was shot in the eye). Let's not forget that this slaughterer of innocents, in his final moments, used a woman as a human shield. A heartless coward to the end.
The steel arrow points that Three Rivers Archery has are far better than the old brass arrow tips as well. The old brass arrow tips would often buckle or dent, whereas these new steel points are practically indestructible. They sell whistling steel points as well, although I am not sure why anyone would want a whistling arrow point. What is the point?

2. Using the bubble wrap as a guide, draw images on the paper of different road trip sights. Get your child involved by talking about what you might see and asking them for suggestions (even if you're unlikely to see one, keeping them on the lookout for an elephant could occupy a lot of time). Depending on their age, use colors, numbers, letters and symbols to give the game an educational element. If they are old enough, kids can draw the images themselves — or give them a sheet to make their own game. If you're not comfortable drawing, find clipart online to print or cut out pictures from magazines and glue them in place.
And of course, any skinny woman who bitches endlessly about women always getting the raw deal, being perpetual victims, and also having a sense of entitlement – I would not waste my time even acknowledging her.

In the end, I was quite impress and swayed by Deep Church. The issue I have are minor and I like the way that Belcher is working to bring the positive of both extremes in the church debate together. I would love to hear from others as we work out the issues of worship and culture. Do you think Belcher found a reasonable middle point?
Making millions of records accessible, the internet has allowed family history research to grow by leaps and bounds. I have been able to trace 3/4 of my ancestors back to Germany. I found one of my family lines in church record books from the late 1700′s and found what town they were from. I have also been doing my husband’s tree for over a year and at first he didn’t think I would find anything. Finding a John Smith from Kentucky is like finding a needle in a haystack. Well, his family tree is turning out to be large and quite impressive. I have been able to trace through his mother’s line that he is descended from dozens of the first settlers of Quebec in the early 1600′s. Some of these ancestors were also some of the first residents of Detroit and the first settlers of Monroe, MI. His family tree branches on his father’s side are no less impressive. Several of his family lines lead to ancestors who migrated to Kentucky from Maryland in the late 1700′s and were some of the state’s first settlers. Some of them were from prestigious families and there is at least one person who I believe is to be a patriot of the Revolutionary War.
Such a large number of misfits should come as no surprise in a country which has seen such a upsurge in the radical individualism of youth since the 1960s. The US Army has had to market with campaigns such as "Be all that you can be" and "Army of One." This is, of course, rather ironic, since the Army never has been and never can be a place for individualism. But the ad campaigns do reveal how systemic and important individualism really is in this country.
There’s an anxiety of influence factor that Lehrer touched upon that can be very detrimental to a group endeavor. Anxiety of influence occurs in creative processes when the members hold back creatively because of outside influences. Usually, it comes from disapproving family members or just perceiving that you will be judged personally for your work. Shaking this can be difficult.

While I was wondering about it out loud, Lovely Husband observed that our young adult years are such an important time. And he is right. At that age we are no longer children and we are not yet adults. It’s a time of life which gives us a unique freedom. It is vivid, vibrant, full passion and zeal. It’s the time of life when we are exploring so much on our own, but also in the company of our friends. We think about the “meaning of life”, we indulge in wild parties, we push boundaries, we discover our independence, we savour the intense flavours of love, are swamped by heartbreak, we find ourselves, we lose ourselves and we find ourselves again. We join protest marches, we try to save the world, and in doing so we save ourselves. The good and the bad, the highs and the lows are all caught up in an intense whirlwind of living and feeling – of Being - in the most utterly vivid, sometimes painful and, frequently, guileless self-absorbed way.

I looked back at Gino and suddenly, I saw all too well how it would be from here. Gino would one day leave me, just like he left the others.

'One of the most well-known stories about St Jude begins in Edessa, the capital of a small kingdom in the area of what is now Urfa in Southern Turkey. The king of Edessa, Agbar V 'The Black', had contracted leprosy and, having heard of Jesus's miracles, wrote to ask Jesus to come and heal him. Eusebius quotes the letter as well as Jesus's alleged reply: Agbar, Ruler of the city of Edessa, to Jesus the Saviour, the good physician, who has appeared in Jerusalem, Greetings -
3 Khaleej Times story, “Global, not Arab, spring’. It ain’t over till it’s over,” is an oft used line to qualify an unfinished sporting event that could go either way. The same is equally true of the economic and political events that have unfolded around the world during the last year, surprisingly starting with the Arab world. While at least four Arab leaders have been forced out this year, even more governments in Europe have been ousted. The unrest and political events in Britain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and the US (Occupy Wall Street has inspired similar protests around the world) begs the question: does politics determine economy or economy determines politics?
Looking ahead to Acts 3:19,20, we can see this offer in action as Peter speaks to those Jews worshipping in the temple,
However, the fog signal wasn't enough to prevent continuing disasters along this stretch of coast. Four years to the day after the Acuelo was impaled on Colorado Reef, a three-masted Welsh ship, Rydal Hall, crashed in the fog onto Frenchman's Reef. Only 21 members of the 30-man crew survived, and none of the cargo did. Salvage was impossible--the broken ship languished almost a month on the rocks before cracking apart, meanwhile spilling tons of coal into the water and onto the beach. Further wrecks of ships carrying railroad iron and lumber littered the rocky coast as more vessels met their demise on the rocks. (source: information signs at Montara Lighthouse)

PR experts have three reasons for this, and according to Francesco Guerrera they are “the shiny object,” “the loyalty issue,” and “the lack of choice” http://on.wsj.com/HyZfr2. The first has to do with shorter attention spans that prevail today. Investing and consumer publics move on faster than traditional media so there is little impact on the brand’s bottom line. Next, customer loyalty helps dispel negative attitudes about the brand and restore positive brand equity. The last, lack of choice, is about a lack of alternatives. Other related companies are usually facing similar issues, so often there is no better choice out there. If it were a bigger crisis, this would be where a rebranding along the lines of Burberry’s would come into play. Burberry softened and lessened their iconic pattern when it became trendy among gangs. Granted, that’s a more serious crisis and a worse comparison to be made than what Skittles faces in this case. Profits and reputation may take a hit, but it will be quite minimal and Skittles should bounce back fast. After a while, Skittles’ brand identity association with this event will not be its primary identifying factor. In some cases it’s better to do nothing at all. Skittles has played it smart from the start and, because of that, they will reach the pot of gold at the end of their rainbow and come out alright on the other side.

Yesterday was the opening night of The Death of Klinghoffer at English National Opera.
The play was very good, encompassing all the familar comedic bits from The Addams Family TV shows and movies. The actors playing Gomez and Fester stole the show. The other actors were adequate but in my opinion they had a mediocre script/songs to work from. The sets were very creative and beautiful. We could see all the action and the acoustics were so good we didn’t miss a word. Over all, it was worth the price. Andy liked it. You can read a right-on review of it by Mark Meszoros in the News-Herald, With a great Gomez, “Addams Family” avoids gruesome death.

Since Peter’s return we have sort of fallen into a comfy little routine of letter writing (emails, really). Where I used to either read (news!) or watch a movie before bed, now I grab a cup of tea, burn a candle, turn on some nice music and write my sweet friend all the events of the day.
Izzy was finally extubated in the morning and she is breathing on her own, even though she is still receiving oxygen for respiratory support. She could have been extubated yesterday, but she decided otherwise. Beanie thought she would rather just sleep through the day and not breath over the ventilator, except for a brief period of time when she got mad at an unsolicited diaper change and showed us who is boss. While Beanie was on la-la land, her neurologist came by and programmed her VNS device. Between the gastrostomy button in her tummy and the VNS gadget in her chest, I feel like we have a bionic baby.

While I worked all day Friday, my mom went grocery shopping, stopped at the party store, made the birthday cake (I did the decorating when I got home), cut up fruit for fruit salad, and made the pizza dough for Friday night's dinner. I don't think the party would have happened without her. Dinner wouldn't have, either! Thank goodness for moms! After we got the boys to bed, I decorated the birthday cake. It turned out pretty cute.

Much more prominent in the novels than in the series. Novel Dark Passenger (DP) is portrayed as a separate, conscious entity that lives inside Dexter and drives much of Dexter’s Need to kill. It’s described as being able to enter a person who has experienced a severely traumatic event, especially as a young child. While some feel this “possession” element of the novels spoils the storyline, I think it adds an interesting supernatural element and allows for more storytelling freedom.

Ray Dennis Steckler was one of the only guys who ever was able to kill off his ex-wife legally! What a freakin' genius, he even did it more than once, and got her to pay for it, because on top of all that, Carolyn Brandt produced this film as well!
Mark Strong has the thankless task of playing yet another bad guy. He does it so well, which is why he keeps getting cast in these roles. He serves his purpose as an impediment to Delysia’s happiness. To his credit, Strong refuses to resort to a cartoonish caricature and gives Nick a kind of reptilian charm that is fun to watch. Lee Pace has the dashing romantic leading man shtick down cold but he’s no doorstop and doesn’t make things easy for Delysia. Michael’s ultimatum forces her to make a decision about the men in her life. The obvious chemistry between them makes you root for these two crazy characters to wind up together. It’s also great to see underrated character Ciaran Hinds playing Pettigrew’s suave, potential love interest. Like McDormand, he underplays his role and the scenes he has with her are some of the strongest in the film. They provide a respite from the madcap antics as they play two people bound by societal rules and are yearning to break free of them.

There is a lot of experiential evidence from people who have been using kombucha over many years. Many of the benefits reported include improvements in energy levels, metabolic disorders, allergies, cancer, digestive problems, candidiasis, hypertension, HIV, chronic fatigue and arthritis.

Three times Jesus said “Peace be with you” in this passage. It was interesting to discover where our tradition of ”Passing the Peace” comes from.

This past weekend, we toddled off to the gun store to see if we could find ones that the boys would be able to handle. The store was packed with people, and the line at the gun counter was several people deep. When it was our turn, young Levi behind the counter showed us several different types of rifles and pistols with great patience and humor and gentle pointers. Of course, we weren't actually buying the guns that day, just looking, which made the fact that he spent 30 minutes with us pretty amazing. When we were done, and Levi thanked us for coming by, I pulled out an old phrase that I thought I'd abandoned years ago:

I’m sure it’s hard to understand this pull back. It’s so strong. It feels like an anchor and I can go only go so far away before it reminds me of its existence. I’ll never escape, it’s not like an illness or something. I’m feeling this quite a bit lately, a lot tonight. It happens when I’m lonely, or stressed out, or thinking about my friend who died a year ago. I think things like, ‘fuck it, I’ll just run away and hide out in some flat somewhere and work as an escort, and live that fake life for as long as I’m sellable for’. In my current financial situation, it would be so so so easy to use that as an excuse, but an excuse is all that it would be.

An article profiling some of my work at FortWhyte Alive, and some of my side interests, ran in the Winnipeg Free Press this past Saturday. A series of web videos accompany the article; if you've been on a tour of FortWhyte with me, you'll likely see something familiar in them, and if you've never been, I encourage you to watch them, and let me show you around!
YAAAY!!!!!! I finally got some of the first castings of my 1/350 Gozanti master and they are SPOT ON! JPG Castings will hopefully have a batch of these ready for Wonderfest. The fit for all the parts is spot on, the detail is EXACTLY what was on the master. Jimi even used a new sample batch of resin that is really easy to work with.
Brenda isn't as crazy-dumb as she looks though. She points the gun at Paul, forces him to stand next to Natalie, then does an eenie-meanie-minie-moe to decide which one will get shot first. Before she can pull the trigger, Reese pops up again and stabs her in the arm. Natalie gets the gun, and Brenda taunts her so she shoots Brenda, who crashes through a window. This movie has a serious window fetish.

I thought about learning to golf so I could meet more men. I spent a lot of time wracking my brain to think of where men are, particularly single men. I even went one Saturday and just walked around a Bass Pro Shop.

Jesus understood his Father to be “most merciful” — indeed, reading the parable through, we might say that it is “his property always to have mercy.”** This relentless mercy tends to produce one of two responses: wonder and gratitude on the one hand, a bad case of the sulks on the other. The General Confession begins by calling us to recognize the mercy of God as an inexhaustible wonder, in light of which we can admit plainly, without guile or rationalization, every bit of dirty dirt we carry, from our unshod feet to our tangled hair. ***
We do not have freedom but a guise of it. We are allowed to walk around making as many small choices as we want to, we live in our own home where we believe that no one has the right to enter unless we deem it so – or a warrant is produced-, we believe in whatever religion-or none- that we wish, we raise our children by our decisions until they are old enough……. or so we thought.
I understand that this is the life we signed up for. I understand that "I didn't get issued with his sea bag." And I understand that we live a great life. We have a military health benefit that I am incredibly grateful for. We have a decent income. We have a better chance at job security than some civilians. And I am grateful. We are blessed.

It is of particular attention that faced with an unending resistance in Iraq, the US had planned to spark a civil war between the Sunnis and Shias. In this context, a study of the Rand Corporation, titled ‘US Strategy in the Muslim World After 9/11′ was conducted on behalf of the then US Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force.

I don’t, honestly. I have a brother who is three years older than me, most of the music I listened to came from his collection. He had broad tastes in music, and I latched onto the NYC punk records he had – particularly Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers.

I've been slowly combing through Gardner Dozois's 1991 collection Modern Classics of Science Fiction. This is science fiction broadly speaking. This collection skips a lot of frequently anthologized works in favour of less appreciated classics. They are all gems. In January I read "The Golden Horn" by Edgar Pangborn (originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1961). You ever do something that was sort of selfish and had such terrible consequences you know it will haunt you for the rest of your life? You know that feeling? Yeah. Pangborn nails it.
I could list my resume, but that would really be no fun. So, like any project, lets just dive in and hope for the best result!
After lunch was a tour of the R&D labs. We passed around some swabs of pure aromas (myrcene, DMS, and some others). What better way to top off a great day of tastings than to test our sensory perception? We proceeded to Sensory and were separated in tasting booths to attempt two triangle tests. The first test was 2 fresh Pale Ale samples and 1 spiked with Skunky mercaptans. My fatigued palate failed to identify this one correctly (or maybe I just liked that skunky aroma?) but I successfully detected the next test which was an aged sample. Our group reassembled for a preference test and we picked the pub-only Pale Ale over the Draft Pale Ale by a 6-4 margin in a blind taste (I preferred the malty balance of the Draft at this point in the day).

I saw some fresh octopus - that would be tasty on the grill!

The past few years- the spotlight papers get sent home with the children- and we, as the parents get to help the child fill them out. "What is your favorite color?" "Do you have any pets?" " What is your favorite food?"... etc... This year the primary presidency decided that not enough spotlight papers returned back to them, so they handed all the spotlight papers to the teachers in primary, and got the kids to fill it out in church.

Keeping self-harming people from speaking on your forum deprives them of a necessary venue through which they can attain help. If Tumblr truly believes that calorie restrictors and physical mutilators need help, then allowing them to write on Tumblr is one of many crucial ways that their ideas can be challenged and they can be convinced to seek professional assistance. Blogging is inherently interactive, and people challenging those beliefs is a great way for someone to have their mind changed.

Jaywalking is also an important tool that you need to master to gain an advantage on most pedestrians. If you always wait for the little flashing man to tell you to walk, you’ll end up walking inside of big crowds after every traffic light, struggling to break free from the pack. If you are in Montreal, make sure that there are no MUC Police peoples around, as they occasionally give tickets for jaywalking. I’ve also heard horror stories of certain countries where jaywalkers could even serve time in jail, not just receive a fine. So, jaywalk responsibly, and don’t get hit by a car. Getting hit by a car can seriously throw off your overall pace.

So, this post won't have anything to do with her school, just Jay's.

Dollhouse – We love Joss Whedon because he creates these wonderful fully contained universes and peppers them with characters we care about. Yes, there have been some inconsistent episodes but I’d prefer inconsistent Joss Whedon over almost anything else on television. Despite the naysayers FOX haven’t mishandled this show; it was never going to be a hit. But no matter how quickly his shows are cancelled Joss Whedon always delivers the goods.

My love of classic soul and genuine R&B grooves just hasn't been reflected in this here blog of late, so there I was the other day, blasting William DeVaughn's wonderful 'Be Thankful For What You've Got' (a hit in 1974) so all the neighbours could enjoy it as well and I knew I'd be bunging this one up pretty soon. Then I remembered Massive Attack's version from their first album, Blue Lines (1991) and wanted to throw that one at you. In the end, you have a choice. Choose both. Beautiful. Enjoy.

The first stage of the new Portal will launch this summer. This will allow students to see information on their timetable, e-mail, appointments, library books, exam results, twitter etc to name but a few services. They will also be able to access web based information about University Schools and Departments. This is all built around the “5 minute” concept – bringing the key items together in one place so that students can check their key information in 5 minutes. Staff likewise will be able to link in their calendar, e-mail, many other services and have access to web based information from other University schools and Departments.
As a wee little company, in a remote part of Oregon, in a recession, with less than two years since the doors opened, advertising is very expensive. I just simply can't afford it. The goal has always been to not have to, so we don't. Initially I used the local rag, and put a few ads in Beer NW magazine (server was down when I wrote this). Now I'm finding that I don't have to. Word of mouth seems to be starting to yield new visitors; can't beat that. More interestingly is the free publicity that has come about in the last few months.
Sam Adams Light is not just a lighter version of Samuel Adams Boston Lager® but rather the culmination of over two years of tireless research and brewing trials to create a flavorful Light beer. And it has proved to be worth the wait. Brewed using only the finest two row malt and German Noble hops it has a smooth, complex roasted malt character that is superbly balanced with the subtle orange fruit notes of the Noble hops. Sam Adams Light® finishes crisp and smooth without any lingering bitterness, leaving you yearning for more.

(Oddly enough, the trick to writing near-term predictive science fiction that survives seems to be naming the book after the year it is supposed to take place: 1984 and 2001 still stand up quite well despite the fact that those years have come and gone. Oh, sure, you can argue it’s because they are outstanding novels, and I wouldn’t disagree. But it’s also curious that they are both named for years now past.)
In the meantime, I have had some interesting comments and discussions about yesterday’s post. In particular, Walski showed me a posting which questions whether the Federal Constitution is the fundamental basis for Malaysian law.

Publisher’s blurb: Often little-known but extraordinary, the quiet heroes of one of the most destructive wars in his-tory left indelible impressions among those whose lives were touched by their actions. Up against firing squads, torpedoes, rogue waves, P.O.W. camps, and all the living hells of warfare, they persevered, they saved lives, and they valiantly served their country. Distinguished and decorated, these men used unconventional methods and quick-thinking tactics to excel on the front lines.

The moral of the story is that I think we were all glad we got to see a few races, but they were not as fun as we expected and the glaring heat was just too much for us to handle. So we took a few token pictures and got ourselves out of there to find some breakfast.
An interesting weekend for coverage of beer.
I was there with Julie, after that we went diner, having a good time. I missed a train and arrived at home around 1:20/30, impossible to sleep before 2:AM, and woke up every hour, to finally wake up at 9:AM...
At this point I got up, put my dish away, and went over to his table and asked him if he was talking about chanting nam-myo-ho-renge-kyo. Of course he was!!! I offered my liturgy book to the man and actually he offered it to the woman who jealously took it for herself. Both of them wanted my contact information. Neither of them knew that the SGI Culture Center was around the corner. They had never heard of it. The woman, I learned, is a dancer and a healer, and the man is a theoretical physicist.
One thing I was curious about was the brewery's lock on hops, inquiring as to how Blue Mountain would weather the storm, especially being such a young operation working on such a small scale. Taylor replied that with his hop farm producing enough Cascades for the beers they brew, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to supplement their supply, and they wouldn't have to worry about purchasing that particular hop on the open market. Without their own crop, they'd be paying up to 2000% more than they would have a year or two ago for the same type of hop, as Cascades are immensely popular and increasingly scarce.
But, I’m nervous the warrior is entertaining the idea because he’ll do anything to make me happy. But I want him to do it because it’s a life he wants. It’s his body and I know he wasn’t stoked about the vasectomy in the first place, or the sperm retrieval for IVF.

I had to have a coffee to get me home, and a cup of Rwandan at Brew Ultimo did me just right. But just to show that a beer-lover's totally great day isn't always over...when I came home and grilled up some bockwurst, with caramelized onions and steamed broccoli for our family dinner, I decided to settle in with a sample pounder of Narragansett Cream Ale, their new year-round brew...and it was excellent, just a bit sweet, just a bit bitter, and 100% refreshing. It was a great day in Philly with Pliny the Younger, but it was good to be home!

With Polly many of the daily questions are sartorial in nature. Dressing Pip each morning is relatively simple: I pull out of his drawer some variation of the same button-up shirt and khakis that I wear most days, throw on some athletic socks and tennis shoes, and run a brush through his hair. Polly’s wardrobe choices require a whole other set of considerations: Is today a dress day or a pants day? Do I put bloomers on if she’s wearing tights? Which pair of shoes is supposed to go with this outfit? How do I get these hair clips and hair bands in without her screaming in pain?

I believe at about the same time, my lease for the shop was coming up. Head Office was jumping my rent an astronomical amount and took it to the most extreme the lease allowed even though they knew my circumstances. I figured they just wanted to squeeze me out, but instead I contacted my lawyer and we began a long and arduous battle with them too. I was also way behind in payments to them for tire inventory, they were pressing me for that too. Not what you’d expect, but it was what transpired.
And my body, needed pure energy. I know finding recipes that are warm and filling yet healthy are hard to find in the winter, but this one still feels like a hug.
This is inspiring me to stop being so selfish about how I treat my wife, and how I treat our relationship. That I shouldn’t think about me coming first, and I don’t need to think about or be concerned with how she treats me, my concern is how I show her love, not how she should be showing me love.
Thanks for reading my little blog these last three years. Any time I find out someone's read any of these essays, rants, or even just a long, winding sentence I wrote, it makes me feel just like that.
Because nothing makes me feel older than going to the clinic for my yearly gynocology exam and being surrounded by young pregnant women and then when it's my turn to see the nurse and doctor our conversation turns to things such as menopause, hot flashes, incontinence, medication, and hypertension.
I will also say that blogging has forced me to rethink lessons, try harder, and become inspired to express my creativity...something that was beginning to get lost these last two years. Creativity was at a high for me when I taught 1st...I'm glad that this blog has helped me find it again.

Another reason to write shorter is that it will force you to write better. “The only art is to omit,” said Robert Louis Stevenson. “If there is anywhere a thing said in two sentences that could have been as clearly and engagingly said in one, then it’s amateur work.” When I write freelance articles, I’m usually required to write no more than 800 words. My notes and interview transcripts run thousands of words, and it all seems important.

In the beginning it was working wonders, around the 2nd week I noticed a difference in that my lashes did appear fuller and slightly thicker. That then tapered off to nothing, in fact they looked like they were falling out a little - not good. So I stopped that because a) in all honesty I found it a huge chore.. mainly due to my own fault of being too lazy to wash out an old mascara tube and wand, so I ended up applying from the mahoosive bottle I had! And b) after further reasearch I wondered if I had purchased the incorrect castor oil, I dont believe mine was the pure oil, so I ditched the trial with the intention of buying some decent, more expensive pure oil.. Then life got in the way and with pennies dwindling I haven't yet had chance to buy it.. However, since then I've rediscovered a new product, or at least found somewhere that sells it (it seemed to have dropped off my radar for a while!). Soooo, next month I will be purchasing a 'proper' eyelash treatment and will be sticking to it. More to come on that!

I gave my head a mental shake. A well-to-do friend was selling her 1-year-old Toshiba unit for 6 million ($300). Cost to install? Đ300,000 ($15). Deal! Even her friend wouldn’t visit because her house is too hot.
But what’s wrong with that? A fully formed movement is not going to spring from the ground. It has to be created. And who can say what exactly needs to be done? We are not talking about ousting a dictator; though some say we want to oust the dictatorship of capital.
An old man sat at his ancient desk, that most faithful of companions. It had supported his weighty, isolated mind for nigh on half a century, helping write letters to distant kin that died one by one while he lived past them all. He had finally felt death approach in the last few days. Its hands in its pockets, slinking around the corner and glancing intermittently at its wristwatch, it had the self-justified impatience of youth that is always so strange to the old that have forgotten it.
He was not happy—and yet, I loved every minute of it!

The gospel affects not just my destiny, it affects my day. It makes me hang in there, because Calvary love is my example. "Tough love" is important - been there, done that, got the T-shirt. But "tough love" is only as effective as the tender Calvary-love that supports the whole relationship. If there is no relationship, "tough love" is a moot point. No one cares. No one is listening.
“Any kid would be lucky to have a friend like Harold,” is what my mom always said when I complained about something Harold had done. It didn’t matter if he beat me at NCAA12 for 46th time. Or killed me at Texas Hold’em for the 23rd time. No really. He kept track. Each time he beat me at anything, he’d write down the date, the game, and the score in a green composition notebook that he carried around.
Turning our workings on their head for a moment, it becomes clear that if we are to provide owner-occupied dwellings for persons on average earnings, then such dwellings must never cost more than four times such average earnings, nor should the land upon which they are to be built, cost more than four times such average earnings per acre.

No problem. He will phone Justin, who has benefited several times from help from us. (anything from 40$ until payday, to a couple of beers on an evening with the husband unit.) UMMMMM Justin is hemming and hawing about what he can and cannot do. Driving out to get me, and take me to work? In the “CAN’T column.
There's a trick in there. I believe that we are not suppose to doubt our worth because of our FAITH that God knows what She is doing. I think FAITH is the bandage for self-doubt.
Christian says this has nothing to do with him, and Sheamus said he would give up his Uncle Fargas’ lucky green testicle.
PILM: Very true. What do you think the future of music holds in that regard, with this current younger generation so used to over compressed, super loud disposable music? How are we going to keep music having the dynamics that it used to have?
The next time the sun rises, our funky little mountain hamlet will be holding its civil elections. In a township of two-hundred, not including drop-ins, dogs, and ground squirrels, this may not sound terribly impressive, and, depending on the level of small-town intrigue, it isn't. Still, someone needs to help count ballots.
There was beauty to be found in the mangled corpse of what was once Seventy-one, for from this cadaver of a weak-willed woman, she would create a machine of efficiency, power and terror. The others agreed, moving in and tearing at Seventy-one until nothing but the naked essence of her remained. They would finish the job without her.
Sleek, Stiff, Resilient. What are we communicating this Fall 2012?
CL: How nice, how come the Senator or anybody else didn't bother to protect the non-Muslim soldiers from Hasan after knowing that Hasan was a threat for months? Why is it that everyone bends over in a politically correct effort to make sure that Muslim are not offended? When do non-Muslims stand up for each other? Our #1 policy in this war is not to offend the Muslims. These are the same policies that are sinking the UK in regards to Islam. So why are we following them?

If Malays are so proud to wear their religion on their sleeve, why do they not demand that the sermons cover corruption issues?
They say that wearing the burka is humiliating – who says? Muslim women who wear the burka? No. It’s women who don’t wear the burka, men and women who aren’t Muslim, men and women who haven’t taken the time to understand the issues and benefits of the burka. Men and women who have little respect for Islam. And they get those so-called scholars, whom they have influence over, to declare some ruling publicly that the burka is not Islamic, just to justify their position. These so-called scholars have no right to try to change laws in Islam and mis-lead people.

Then came Standard Foxtrot and my heart just sunk. Four months ago, I’d never heard nor had I ever had to execute a heel turn. Heel turns are the hardest thing in the world for me (and apparently quiet a few other dancers). I had to do a Standard heat uncontested, which meant I was out there with Tina alone and petrified of my heel turns. Super Tina, corralled me through and it went OK thanks to her. Then I blew and I mean BLEW the Quick Step. I didn’t fall I just couldn’t keep time and messed up all the shapes and spin turns.
I had been moving forward almost since the first day after the mugging with a few set backs here and there. I can honestly say everyday has been a step forward into a better, happier life. But, it was not easy.
So my questions to you, dear blog readers, is what sorts of questions would you ask an author or an author/illustrator? What burning things you have to know? Or what question would you be too embarrassed to ask to their face?

I have big plans for these shelves, once it is warm enough to take it outside and do some work to it, so we will see how this space evolves over the next few months! For now, I am just going to smile at the colorful changes and go read a book.

A live example I can think of is there was a guy I worked with and I *felt* he was interested but wasn’t really sure. Eventually I thought he was just being a nice guy, but then he dropped the hammer and I was like “HUH where’d that come from!” LOL. IOW’s he was always joking with me and making me laugh but he never really flirted with me in the process. So after a while the original idea I had that he had an interest faded and I suddenly believed he was just a funny guy who loved to joke around and tease. So I thought nothing of it. Well one day he got serious and after a bit of laughing at his jokes and things he just came out and asked me if he could call me. It was just a little awkward and weird b/c it threw me off guard since it was so unexpected and b/c he quickly went from one mood to another. I am not saying it’s a bad thing, but it is awkward when you do too much playful teasing and bantering without mixing in your interest so that when you drop the hammer it’s no surprise to her and she was kinda expecting that all the teasing and flirting was a means to an end.

Since Gu Yue Tien is known for its innovative Chinese cuisine, we decided not to order a whole fish but instead went for the signature Pan Fried Cod Fillet with Picked Vegetable glazed with BBQ sauce (RM22 each but looking back at the bill we were charged RM26 each). Bummer! Price aside, the fish was actually well prepared, flaky and fresh and the the tangy pickled vegetables went well with the dish. Would be nice if the cod fish was in a bigger portion though as I wouldn't mind eating more of this dish.

Whenever I can correlate a real-world pattern of social importance with search behavior, I like to seize the chance. So I took the top 100-most correlated-with-teen-births Google searches and broke them into 9 categories, ranked in order of their interest to me. All of these were correlated with the teen birth percentage at the level of .84 or higher. Your interpretations of these are as good as mine. (Background and previous Google search posts are here.)

This sounds all too familiar, but when you look at his actions compared to other leaders such as Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan, and Truong Chinh, it is apparent that Giap had Vietnam’s interest first. When North Vietnam defeated the democratic South and implemented the Communist government in 1975, Giap advocated the safety of South Vietnamese workers and professionals instead of killing them out of vengeance.
The incredibly isolated cases of this happening are nothing compared to the "honor killings" throughout the Arab world. Kind of hypocritical to worry about these isolated cases compared to how women are beaten and abused by their husbands, fathers, and brothers in Gaza and throughout the West Bank (and pretty much every Arab country). Do you find blogs of Arab men and ask them about honor killings? Yeah, I was pretty sure not.

In the 1st post of this series, I talked about the 1st step of getting results when we pray. What a blessing! Any journey begins with the same question and if you missed it, click here to read about it. Do you want a new car? A different home? Peace in a relationship? A cure for your anxiety, worry, or fear? First, you must know the answer to this vital first question. If you walked into the post office wanting a passport there would be a procedure before you could receive it. Spiritual realities are just as simple as following a step by step procedure as well. Procedures have a way of removing the emotional interference that is such a distraction. Now, I can focus on the steps I need to carry out and keep things simple in my walk with God.
After visiting the lighthouse, we got into the car and drove the few miles to the outskirts of Hannibal to visit the Mark Twain Cave. The cave is actually part of a cave complex with two cave systems, Mark Twain Cave and Cameron Cave. The Mark Twain Cave was discovered in 1821 and Cameron Cave in 1925, making them the oldest and youngest show (or tour-guided) caves in Missouri respectively. Visitors can tour one or both of the caves and we opted for the Mark Twain Cave tour because

Fall beers tend to be a bit darker than summer beers and contain more spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.). The alcohol percentage doesn’t change too much when compared to summer beers but still ranges from beer to beer. These are beers that can be enjoyed outside with a heavy jacket on. Not as heavy or dark as stouts (or winter beers) but definitely darker than many of the wheat beers enjoyed in the summer.

Right before I left, I heard a visiting cop citing examples of the incredibly silly things he's "investigated". For instance, the time he responded to a call at a house and arrived to find a large group of people watching TV, eating, just generally hanging out. The officer couldn't indentify who had called or exactly what the call was about. Finally, a woman pulled him aside and said she had called because, "That guy over there keeps looking at me."
This time last week, I had just come back from a week at The Hurst, the Arvon Foundation's centre in Shropshire. Like the other Arvon centres, it is a lovely house in a beautiful place, peaceful and tranquil, with lots of space to think and write. It was the playwright John Osborne's house, and so has lots of writerly associations and reminders, with playbills up everywhere and loos sponsored by Maggie Smith.

I've ranted this before on some DVD board sites, but I don't think I've mentioned it here on my Blog. One of the things that really gets me is the silly security stickers that keep CD and DVD cases closed.
Anyway. Enough of that. I've been a bad DT member on all points, sucked at replying to messages and emails and even worse at keeping my blog up to date and scheduling posts!! On the bright side though.. I have treated myself to a new camera and some SU! goodies. So that should get me going.. once I actually get the time to sit down at my newly organised (ish) desk. I still gotta get that finished. Gahh.. the list is never ending!!
Seriously, I wake up confused as to what the real time is when Daylight Savings Time happens. Ridiculous! But I went to church and I talked about Uganda and youth group. Two things I’m really excited for in the coming months.

At the risk of sounding even older than I am, let me say that there are things I miss about “the good old days” of my youth. Yes, life had its trials back then, too, and—especially having just finished reading “The Help,”—I realize that being white and growing up in the 50’s and 60’s was a whole different experience than my black friends had. But, still, there are by-gone things that I miss. For example…

French spent a lot of years wrestling in both the amateur and professional ranks. He has wrestled in many different promotions around Canada and the U.S., but French hasn't been near a ring in a few years. There was a wrestling show in Smiths Falls, our old home town, this past Friday. I got tickets, and French reluctantly went along.
Later there was the winger, Quincy Owusu-Abeyie. Already better than what we had in the first team 2005, he was an Overmars, Pires and Kanu smoothie. But ouch, baby! Someone added some spice to the mix because that boy was audacious, outrageous and downright paceous. Speedy enough to be the tracer that would light the way to our new home at the Emirates.

So your little son starts to act a little girlish when he is four years old and instead of squashing that like a cockroach and saying, “Man up, son, get that dress off you and get outside and dig a ditch, because that is what boys do.” You get out the camera, and you start taking pictures of Johnny acting like a female, and then you upload it to YouTube, and everybody laughs about it, and the next thing you know, this dude, this kid, is acting out childhood fantasies that should have been squashed…
IT WENT GREAT! I feel like it was my best Showcase so far. We had a couple of mess-ups, all due to traffic issues while doing our opens. We knew that could happen, and we just need to work on that before Dance-O-Rama. But everything else was fantastic! My posture was great, my expressions were better, I was on time for most of the mambo, I was just dancing in the music and not thinking.

Japan and South Korea are exempted for 15 days while Cambodia does not need a visa for 14 days.
He sang of social injustice and protest. He talked about love, and the story of how he and his wife met. (They have been married since 1969, and I was inspired and humbled by their love story, which is still going strong.) He joked about Woodstock, about where his music has taken him, and he spoke like he’d known us all our lives.

She needed to turn their heads down before the fall began in earnest, which took away the option of waiting to see what the Wilder would do. Pevan led the turn again, trying to guess where the creature would be in another eighteen seconds. Federas spread beneath her, clearer and more accurate than any map.

Esquinca is relying on an experienced core of players to keep his team on the right track. Senior forward Martin Hernandez, junior defender Christopher Carrillo, junior defender Ricky Mejia and senior midfielder Adrian Saucedo provide a balance of leadership across the board.
But it requires me to warm up in a similar fashion—or else I can't really get in a groove and enjoy the elation of accomplishment when I finish. It's funny because I need about the same amount of time at the keyboard as I do on the sidewalk. Twenty minutes is the magic number.
We often think of deposits as money “saved”, put by for a rainy day. But in fact, when we lodge a pay cheque, while for many of us it many not languish more than a few days (!), nevertheless, that also creates a deposit.

Once we have successfully completed the course, we will be able to sit for the board exams.
We attended the Bowerbird Bazar at the Queen's Theatre in Adelaide city centre a couple of weeks ago, which was also sponsored by the Australian arm of Etsy. So you can imagine the level of quality and excellence amongst the traders. Very Etsy.
The Working Man’s club on Barton Street is now the Friendship Café, dedicated to the benefit of (Sunni) Muslims. At least three properties on Charles Street have been bought up so that an Islamic centre, with parking, can be built at the back. The Barton & Tredworth Community Trust runs a madressah. It’s trying to sell the premises, due to financial mismanagement, but there’s little danger that a new venue won’t be found for the madressah if the new owners don’t want to share the building.

Personally, I salute the courage of the Egyptian women. The men over there have no courage. I know. I've been there.

Gageler’s argument appears to rest principally on the proposition that section 42 requires an application for registration of a trade mark to be rejected if “its use would be contrary to law”. This, Gageler argues, shows that positive rights of use in a trade mark are not conferred by the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) in that they can be diminished or extinguished by other laws both Commonwealth and State. However this appears to conflate considerations relevant to the creation of a trade mark with the question of whether once created it is a proprietary right for constitutional purposes.

Modern cities are incredibly fragile organisms, which tremble on the edge of disaster the entire time. During a severe blizzard, it is electricity alone that prevents a midwinter urban holocaust. We saw what adverse weather can do, when 15,000 people died in the heatwave that hit France in August 2003. But those deaths were spread over a month. Last weekend’s weather, without energy, could have caused many tens of thousands of deaths over a couple of days.

I'm excited to announce that we plan to produce these interesting mini-batches more often. We think that being able to taste a similar or identical wort fermented with two different yeasts side by side is not only fun but halfway educational too. It's certainly a way to recognize how important of a contributor the yeast is to the flavor profile of most beers. The next one to expect on tap will be a batch of the Six fermented with a newly available strain, Wyeast 3655 Belgian Schelde. It should be on within the next couple weeks. After that we'll have a yet to be fermented variation of the Seven - any ideas or requests for yeast strains? We'll be picking some up by Tuesday the 16th and welcome any suggestions.

As a result, the sonata is two-part. Purcell confirms the significance of the dominant by inverting the procedures of phrases 1 and 2 to make 1a and 2a.

I've been loving all the Christmas music flowing through my speakers these days.
The media always say that no player goes out to injure our players. rVp was out for 5 months because Chiellini thought that he was part of an Itie rival “family”. El Capitan was out for 3 months because the BarcAliens didn’t like the fact he was trying to save Mother Emirates Earth. The Mercenary Gallas was more or less a regular customer.

So on Friday, he offered what he called an “accommodation.”
Never mind that he had his own money and did what he wanted with it. His money was “his money” and my money was “our money”. Heaven forbid if he had to use “his” money for anything that was part of the marital needs. It also doesn’t take into account the money it cost me when I had to pay the taxes on his income (or excess income) over and above what was allowed for his social security disability… he did work consistently even though he was “disabled” – not like he coughed anything up to help cover those expenses, incurred because he wouldn’t take responsibility for working with Social Security to coordinate his work with this disability benefits.
During dinner the bride and groom came back out… and it was then my turn to give my speech and do the vows for them. (it went well… they were very moved) … we went back to our tables.. and the host decided to play some silly games with the people in the crowd. After that…. the entertainment was called up on stage. Two male Chinese singers…(not very good… they seemed to have drunk a lot before hand)… a dancer…he did a…kind of Michael Jackson ..dance impression….(poor MJ would turn over in his grave if he saw that one).… a very handsome, Black American man did a love poem in Chinese ..(had a nice James Earl Jones voice)... and I had the last spot… to perform my traditional Chinese song .. in Chinese of course…. I think I surprised everyone with my performance…. I got a standing ovation. (I could see Michael’s smile from the stage)..One person told me they had never heard a foreigner sing that traditional song before.. and especially in Chinese….(I was a little proud of myself)
Thank you so much for looking! I hope that you will come over and join us on this months challenge!
The inclusion by hospitals of this item should not be seen as suggesting that all midwives attending homebirths need to carry such equipment. There would need to be some compelling evidence that babies born at home would be better off. Hospital babies, many of whose labours are induced when they not quite ready to be born, depressed by narcotics, and premature, ... are the ones that would clearly benefit from the Neopuff TM.
Just leave a message on the post for the seller and we will make sure they get it.
D has been so supportive. She has been very encouraging of my runs, even though there are times when I can hear her mental thoughts saying “really you are going to run again? I wish you would do the dishes instead.” But she doesn’t say this. She helps me find time to get a run in, even if its only for a mile around the block. Yesterday I took the kids for a bike ride and gave D some alone time. When I got back we played outside and this was the first time I ran around the block. After we came in for the night I looked at my bike ride and run on Endomondo. She laughed and said “My wife the triatlete” LOL NO NO NO – I quickly responded. Your wife can’t swim so that will never happen. I can walk, run, or bike but cannot swim. I am so blessed that I have such a great wife.

1. Tyson Gay Injury – It’s been quite some time since we’ve seen the sport’s top sprinters going head to head, even in Majors. When Tyson Gay announced that he would not be competing at nationals and was ending his season, the Bolt v Gay matchup that we had all been looking forward to was once again put on the shelf.

Their menu is not bad and they have some decent noodle dishes and Malaysian fair. Always trying something new I ordered the Asam Laksa the other day. Big mistake as this is an acquired taste. It is a noodle dish in a rich fish mud stock with a large sardine. This is not a small sardine you find in a can, it’s a large unclean whale of a fish with a taste to match. Needless to say I could not finish it.
I seek a woman of no flimsy construction who can tolerate the cyclone of death that my guitar will unleash upon her. Think about the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when the Holy Spirit (or whatever the hell that poorly rendered gaseous conglomerate was supposed to be) ravaged the Nazis by melting their flesh from their mortal bones. This is what my guitar playing does, except there is only vapor left, no bones. I cannot stress this enough: I will play guitar so fast the Earth will be rent asunder and armies of hellions will spew forth to wreak havoc upon the human population.

Gabriel's attitude towards Ireland, his home country, is colored with the polite regard and subtle contempt with which he treats other people in "The Dead." He wants to find favor in the eyes of his aunts' guests, so he holds forth on certain old-fashioned Irish values ("genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us"). At the same time he's embarrassed of his country; in his eyes, his wife's major fault is that she came from the Irish countryside, because he's the sort of man who thinks of himself as worldly and prefers to vacation in Continental Europe.
He bought me a glass of champagne. Okay, I said, ask away. But when you're done, I get to ask a few questions.
Smells like a tart pale. Kind of on type, but also with a hint of rice.
That is the idea one person posited to me. In fact, they went so far as to say that weak heroines were the villains and do not belong in fiction at all.
Because of the goodness in the one bar of chocolate. Oh, and i meant the Dark ones only.
It is obvious to all that Romney believes that government’s primary economic role is to protect and serve the rich folk and the poor folk should not depend on a socialist form of government to protect them. Tell me, why wasn’t the Wall Street bail out considered an example of socialism at work?
Uh, about this chapter. To tell you the truth, I really don’t care about Shallan right now. This is one of the few things that really bug me in books/mangas/whatever. Why introduce a character who’s going through a lot of shit, and then pause and move on to another character who isn’t going through much shit at all? You’re making me lose interest. I mean, at least take that character to a point where we know he’s going to be okay, or things look up a bit, and then bore us. It isn’t fair to me as a reader – YES I HAVE RIGHTS DAMMIT — and it stops the flow. It does, it seriously does.
Or … un-woot here. Jemma returns to Elijah when it’s rather clear in this novel that Villiers is in love with her – and her with him.
I am still loving Project Life - I have been doing it since June 2009 and went completely digital in 2011. It is so much quicker and easier than traditional scrapbooking. My boys love looking through the books at all the photos and remembering the different things that we have done throughout the year. Makes it totally worthwhile.

All of this pales in comparison, however, to what I saw happen during the now infamous video in which a campus poilceman brutally used pepper-spray on non-violent, seated student protesters at UC Davis.The start of the video below is the disgraceful act in question.

Luis was running up the path, out of breath and drenched in sweat. Luis qualified as the laziest assistant Prof. Sinclair had ever hired, so to see him moving so quickly was a surprise. Something was wrong. Even though the graduate student had good Spanish, Luis jabbered with such excitement that he could not make out what was being said. After repeating himself three times, Luis simply shook his head, gestured for Pete to follow, and sped back up the path. Pete followed.

These are mostly scratch built, though centered around the gas tank. The tank was a bit from a Robogear Sprut model. If you play orks and don't know about the Robogear models, do yourself a favor and go look them up. I think they're OOP, but you can usually find them on ebay or other reseller sites. They're a fantastic source of bits for orkish vehicle conversions.

When I was a little girl, visiting my grandparents' summer place in the middle of nowhere Connecticut, my greatest joy came in trips to (what was to me, at the time) the most amazing place on earth: The Victorian House, a ramshackle old Painted Lady with an incredible series of rooms packed to the brim with every kind of knick-knack, kitchen item, old book, vintage fur, enormous carved highboy, broken doll, old postcard and vinyl record an estate sale could produce, plus a fabulous little squash-faced Pekingese who always manned the counter. I could amuse myself for hours in the costume jewelry or book section (here I found my first copy of Desiree and learned that my namesake was Napoleon's first love...) and spent many long hours tentatively brushing my fingertips over inlaid furniture and shining sterling tableware.

In the blogging sector of my life, the words I heard were irrational, ignorant of data, egoist, unthinking.. bordering on lunacy and never to the point. But hundreds of such interactions have thrown up a few divine, sane people, intelligent, original thinkers and for these people had I kept the doors open to all and sundry. (Now closed however!)

Hillary Rodham’s thesis gave him a mixed review, conceding that Alinsky was “a born organizer” and “a man of exceptional charm” in “a peculiarly American tradition” but ultimately judging him unable to create larger social change. She was “tempted” but declined his offer of a job and went on to law school.
Big Brother Owen even stayed the night with us in the hospital that first night. I wanted him there with us so much and I was overjoyed that no one said anything about it. The next morning we were able to hang out and get to know our newest family member.

It has not been the best night in terms of random luck -- my iPhone had died and the craft beer bar was closed when we arrived after yakiniku -- but the silver lining is that I found craft beer cans at yet another Circle K in town. It seems the word is spreading. It's now up to three Circle K's here in Ise that are selling Yona Yona Ale and Ginga Kogen American Pale Ale. My post dead-phone stop into the Circle K nearest to my place turned out positive indeed.
"Very important day, today." Okay, I'll go practice.
Third, both writers have written stories that are recognized almost universally as powerful, highly-enjoyable, and wonderfully imaginative. Anyone who can come up with characters like Lucy Pevensie, Elwin Ransom, Samwise Gamgee, or Theoden of Rohan is a person I want to know on a deeper level.
Although this is a method developed within statistics, EDA can be applied not just to numerical data but to any situation where we need to understand the phenomenon before us. For example, I had not noticed that the number of scenes between hallucinations in Videodrome reduces by constant factor until I sat down and wrote out the narrative structure of the film (see here).
My dad's fly fishing rods break down into four pieces for easy storage. When he's ready to store his rod and reel, he'll place the end of the rod with the reel in the open 24" pocket and the other three pieces of the rod in the 30" pockets. He'll then cover the end of the three 30" pockets with the fabric flap and tie the straps located on the end of the cover around the whole thing to keep everything in place.

We are invited to this sacredness of time-an ability to sabbath once a week. In a jumbled sort of way, just as we are invited to become co-creators with God, we are invited to be co-sharers of Sabbath.
Still, the barbarians did make off with a bit of the livestock, a few villagers for ransom or slaves, and a few of the buildings were burned down. But I call it a minor Empire victory. They took minimal casualties, half the town was intact, they still had some of the livestock and most of the villagers.
I made my way in to work, trying to think of good stories to tell my workmates but apart from "it was so quiet I could actually hear birdsong when I got home and it made me scared", there was nothing to tell.

We also got bowls of miso soup, two additional orders of blue fin tuna, and an order of white snapper. Everything was so delicious.

4 Ways To Fight Pharisaism With The Gospel
#721/722 - The Golden Coach (1952) & French Cancan (1954) - (#507/484) Back to back Renoir is pretty hard to beat. These succulent, gorgeous films, both coming during the auteur's exile in the Hollywood, are simply beautiful to look at and beautiful to listen to. Both playing games with the idea of stage and screen - what is real and what is not - these two films, along with Elena and Her Men (not on the list, but should be) make up a trilogy of sorts on this very same idea. The River may be Renoir's greatest work outside of France, but these two come a close second and third.

Just read this wiki-entry on Black Ops lead character Alex Mason as to how much background info there was on him at the end…considering this is a “hollywood action game”, where background details dont matter, Treyarch was able to create a lot of depth for the lead character: it was all there if you looked. I loved how Black Ops mixed real historical events with fiction. Surely Ronald Reagan, Oliver North and co will be involved in Black Ops 2?
The lyrics are based on an actual battle between American and British forces in an area known as the Louisiana Purchase. That was a huge piece of land that covered roughly one-third of what is now the continental United States. It extended from the Gulf of Mexico north to include small parts of two Canadian provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan. It stretched between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Mississippi River to the east, covering roughly 828,000 square miles (2.14 million square kilometers). President Thomas Jefferson secured the purchase in 1803 for around 78 million French francs, worth about 60 million dollars at that time. That's about $233 million dollars in today's money, which is less than half of what you could win in the big MegaMillions Powerball lottery today. The purchase doubled the size of the United States at the time and made citizens of the roughly 92 thousand people who lived in the territory at that time. Napoleon Bonaparte called it an affirmation of power for the United States that would ultimately create a maritime rival for England that would one day humble her pride.

We have real choices and we can do what we will of our lives!
Enough of that. Let us get into the story. In the first few scenes, we are introduced to three and a half minutes of Klingon ships flying in a straight line. They encounter a giant blue cloud. Being Klingons, they decide to destroy it, but it winds up destroying them instead. A nearby starbase is also destroyed by the cloud, but not before letting Starfleet know the blue cloud is heading for Earth.

The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. I recommended this book to my husband, and it took him over a year before he finally gave in. When he began reading it, he came in to me and said, "Listen to this." He reread the opening scene to me with awe. He continued to share morsels throughout the book, he loved it so much. I said, "I told you so." Now, go and do likewise. Don't take a year. You won't regret it.

By appointing individuals who represent the magnificent mosaic that makes up New York City, the benefits of a diverse workforce are established and recognized. We reject the argument that diversity compromises merit. Diversity and merit can be achieved by casting a wide net to highly qualified individuals, who are often overlooked and/or may live and work in New York’s outer boroughs, people that relate to the concerns of average New Yorkers.

I was just hanging with my friends and in walks Mr. S in a cute ball cap:) He asked me to dance and we danced the rest of the night away. By the way we no longer dance in public. We are way to OLD for that. Mr. S was on his way to the Final 4 in Charlotte, NC. His friends talked him into leaving a note on my car that night with a # to reach him. Soooo he was really cute and I called and left a message. He was not there of course because he was in NC and did not live at that # anyway. I kinda forgot about the whole thing until...

The previous year I had joined Junior Achievement, which was supposed to teach kids about business. When I went back in the fall of 1967, I learned that one of the new sponsors was a radio station and the company’s likely ‘product’ would be a radio show, for which we would sell advertising. Since I already had an interest in radio and even had my license, I joined immediately and made no secret of my eagerness to do everything. I became president of the company, announcer on the radio program, and the show’s most successful advertising salesperson.

Finally they were all better. Her father was at work and her mother was brushing Sue’s hair, getting her ready for school.

What first caught my attention was a catfish skimming the bank for food. Slowly, moving slightly against the current so as to travel slower than the creek, he was better positioned to eat what he could find on the bank. He had in his attendance a smaller and differently colored cat fish. I never saw a catfish in real life. I was in a deeply relaxed state of mind as I studied him. The keener interest I took in the catfish the more I identified with him. My immediate sensations were those of mud and water slowly moving over my skin. I attained a level of awareness that was attuned to what was of interesting on that muddy bank. My eyes were opened looking intently at the catfish and seeing all that was around me yet my awareness was attuned to the creek’s movement, the bank and the relaxed and meandering hunt for something to eat. The something would be found by nibbling and rustling this mud on the banks of this creek. For that is where I was. That part in me that had sight, smell, touch and texture. That part was seeing the creek from the perspective of that catfish.
During my shower, she got into my alphabet beads and dumped them all over the couch, except for the ones that she put in her mouth. Also, she stole a chocolate from Nik, and apparently used it for a full body skin treatment, so I gave her a bath. She pooped in it.
We caught dinner at Inkanto near the bustling Plaza de Armas. (For it being the 'low season' since it is technically monsoon season things are pretty busy here, I'd hate to see it in the high season! I love traveling in the off season.) We had intended to try another restaurant recommended by the Lonely Planet that offered traditional Peruvian dishes, but alas... where it was supposed to be is now a Starbucks, so either they went out of business or I really need to work on my map reading skills. I'm thinking it's the former. No matter, the nearby Inkanto offered both Italian and Peruvian dishes, so I had another round of Lomo Saltado (a beef/onion dish I'm growing to really like) with risotto and Jim had a Peruvian style lamb shank served with gnocchi which was also very delicious. Jim also had his first pisco sour mixed drink, which is very popular here. He says it is a lot like a margarita, since pisco is a lot like tequilla.

I realize I’m a little crazy… in the sense that I have a very mild case of OCD. This applies to things like having control over a situation, cleaning, where things are placed/misplaced. I could tell you EXACTLY where something is placed, as long as I’m the one who put it there, or it hasn’t been moved since the last time I saw it. I can tell when one little thing has been moved, and it actually bothers me. I can’t stand messes, so if I’m having people over, more than half my night is spent tidying up. The boyfriend pointed out that this is a problem.

6 “Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them. 7 Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. 8 Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. 9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.”
Thank you StopAndScrap.com. And have a fabulous day everyone!^_^
This article comes with my standard disclaimer: Although it worked for me, it may or may not work for you, and I offer no warranties or guarantees of any kind. I present the following for experimental use only. Don’t put it on a production server unless you, personally, are satisfied that it works the way you need it to. If it stops working, you have my sympathy but that’s about it. If it breaks your system, you own all the pieces. I am not your technical support, so don’t complain to me if it doesn’t work, but if you leave a detailed comment maybe I or someone else can point you in the right direction. Just saying that something doesn’t work is not a detailed comment, and if you leave a comment like that, don’t be surprised if all you hear is crickets chirping. Still here? Let’s get started then.
Throughout the book, there seemed to be some pacing issues. I completely am fine with the slow set up as Carson built her world and provided the reader with enough information to understand the plot, but after that, the pace seemed to be a little bit jerky. One hopes to have a plot build, reach a minor conflict, build some more, reach another conflict, build again to the climax, but The Girl of Fire and Thorns never really settled into a rhythm for me.

I hope to see you at these events!
Bronson is director Nicholas Winding Refn’s semi-biopic about Michael Peterson/Charlie Bronson, the United Kingdom’s most notorious prison inmate. With the exception of about four months here and there, Bronson has been locked up his entire adult life, moved more than 100 times (including in and out of maximum security asylums for the criminally insane), and is currently serving out a life sentence with pretty much zero chance for parole.

As we get into work everyone crowds around me and asks how I am. They all are suitably impressed by my bump. I am less happy about that and ask how they would like walking around with a big lump and with co-workers who weren't tactful enough to pretend they couldn't see it.
But I for one believe her words still have a future.

Looking up the sources and everything else available only turned up two things, this figure, and the drawing at the top of this post.
We'll see if he turns out to be worth this very unusual amount of effort I'm putting forth. But I think he will. He answered my email today, even though we're meeting tomorrow, not leaving my questions hanging out there. I like that. It's different from my usual experience; thoughtful. Even though he can't seem to recall every detail our conversation the way I can, I think he is genuinely interested. And I think I'll be putting my best foot forward tomorrow. So we'll see what he has to offer and where it goes.
Photography- These gigs are very sporadic and tend to be the same clientele. Every now and again, I will get a new client but they come to me from word of mouth. I don't advertise for these gigs and they usually come in spurts. I do love taking pictures and I could definitely make more money doing this if I were to try and bring in new clients. But, from these gigs, I am able to really stock up on bulk items that keep my groceries down. They are often on weekends and last most of the day.

Remember I recently did a mixed media collage - my first commission ....and I was asked to do another....
This led to nights of crying in bed, coming to terms with the fact that I live in a world where someone decided that in our lifetime we must go to school to be successful. Now this is where I really have to wonder how it came to be that with this beautiful world, where every person has one shot at living on it and experiencing it, how does someone feel like they have the authority to decide what will be the acceptable society? Who decided, out of all the paths life could have taken, that we must go to school for the first quarter or so of our lives, that we must do this in order to be accepted in society as productive and intelligent? And why did everyone agree to it?
An allegedly Catholic sister who fails to uphold the authentic Catholic faith in her everyday work is giving scandalous false witness to her neighbor, while attempting to live the consecrated life in an undisciplined and seriously disordered way.
It has been 6 months since I took a fall down some stairs and as I like to say ruined my back...
Marinade would be: In a food processor, combine a large thumb of ginger, x3 Kaffir lime leaves, a bunch of corriander, juice and zest of 1 lime, 4 garlic cloves, 2 sliced and diced chillies, sesame oil, lemongrass stalk and sea salt. Blend together well and use half of this mix to marinade the chicken. Save the other half for your broth.
Daughter loves horseriding. It's her favourite thing in the whole wide world. She's been having lessons every week for about two years now and it's very slow progress, but today she took part in her first ever horseriding competition. She did a dressage test.
This example is also felt by a number of sports fans. I was watching Wisconsin in the NCAA tournament and had turned on the game part way through the first half and Wisconsin was in the lead, but the more I watched the worse Wisconsin played. Out of frustration, I turned the television off. A few minutes later, I turned the game back on and the Badgers had regained their lead. Yet again, the more I watched, the worse Wisconsin played and their lead dwindled. This scenario replayed itself a few more times as I was convinced that my watching of the game was “jinxing” my beloved Badgers. I was the cause of them playing badly. So for the sake of my team, I turned off the television and went and did something else. While it is irrational to think that my watching of the game was the cause of poor play, fans and players become superstitious that certain actions unrelated to the game can cause a team to win or lose.

I have had well over 100 different prophetic dreams in the last few years that were telling me this was going to happen.
