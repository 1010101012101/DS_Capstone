But embarrassment and dishonor is worth the juicy, pink, grass-fed patty rubbed with salt and pepper topped with thick-cut Benton's southern bacon and all coddled in a buttery pillow-top bun soon delivered to my table. It's probably one of the top 10 burgers I've had in the last few years (though admittedly it's probably number 10 of 10). Featuring a nice touch of minerality, it isn't a change-your-life burger like the soft/crispy patties dripping with tallow fresh from the griddle at Edzo's. I suspect part of this is that Butcher & Burger doesn't grind their meat in-house like Edzo's. (Owner Josh Woodward, who spends a great deal of time chatting up the front of the house stops by and confirms this fact when I ask.)

The 201-horsepower ILX 2.4 ($30,095 and up) is an honest Acura: mechanically satisfying, dynamically stimulating. The 2.4 comes only with a six-speed manual transmission. Developers spent time and attention making the shifter feel robust, mechanical. Not as enticing as, say, a Subaru BR-Z or the B&M shifter on some Hyundai Elantra Touring wagons. But pretty good.

In 1964, Scottsdale created a refuse division and began providing municipal refuse collection service to its residents. Back then, the only way to collect refuse from households was by hand. That wasn't good enough for Scottsdale. In 1969, with a federal grant and an innovative spirit, Scottsdale embarked on a historical journey that led the world into the age of mechanized residential refuse collection.
For the first time, the Yankees reliever discussed publicly the circumstances that led to the freak accident that may end up costing him his season.

What you serve all depends on how ambitious you want to be. You could go with some "typical" gamer food - Mountain Dew Code Red and other high-caffeine content drinks, Doritos, and lots of Domino's pizzas - or you could serve up some treats inspired by food from video games.
But there's a substantial difference between a state law and a federal mandate -- between a workable compromise hammered out in a legislative session and an administrative rule handed down to the entire nation. The difference grows more obvious when it involves the two most absurdly politicized topics in American culture: religion and women.
Over the past few months -- and as recently as last week -- metro Detroit hospitals adding the test include Hutzel Hospital, Detroit; St. John Providence, Southfield, and St. Joseph Mercy Oakland, Pontiac, according to doctors and hospital spokespersons.

It's also unclear what, exactly, caused the defect in the disk's casing. It could be the result of a one-time incident or the result of years of stress on Howard's back or a combination of years of stress and a preexisting condition such as a pronounced curvature of the spine.
Franklin was running late -- nearly 45 minutes behind schedule. All was forgiven, though, as soon as she stepped up to the microphone. That once-in-a-lifetime voice of hers remains a national treasure.
EDISON -- An overturned tractor-trailer on the New Jersey Turnpike northbound this morning near Exit 10 in Edison Township blocked the right land, according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation website.
Polls continue to show support for the elements of comprehensive reform. In an Arizona Republic poll last summer, 62 percent supported a path to legalization for the current undocumented population - the strategy reviled as "amnesty" by opponents of comprehensive reform. Pearce's infamous law, Senate Bill 1070, got less support, at 55 percent.
4:13 p.m.: One of the demonstrators says the 6 p.m. dance party in the South Park Blocks -- scheduled after the march -- is gonig to "be rowdy."
Its breezy, old Hollywood air comes from an incomparable list of superstar guests that has ranged over the decades from Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant and Clark Gable, to John Lennon and Jack Nicholson, to the androgynously elegant Marlene Dietrich, who convinced the hotel's Polo Lounge restaurant to change its "no slacks for women" dress code in the 1940s.
Yet this particular Raiders draft, for McKenzie, serves almost as a distraction. He's deep in the demolition phase of construction, and it's a massive undertaking. Sixteen weeks in, he's still clearing cobwebs.
He picked up two stacks of paper and carried them to the jury box. He put them on the ledge. They appeared to be perfectly even. He lifted one sheet of paper from one stack and put it on the other. If this is our evidence, he said, gesturing to the stack with the extra sheet, we win.

Barack Obama was also the beneficiary of good luck, but, and you may disagree, he was also the more skillful player. Like McCain, the party's primary rules played to his advantage in two senses. First, if the Democratic Party had used winner-take-all rules, Hillary Clinton probably would have won the nomination after Super Tuesday on Feb. 5 because of her advantage in large states. Second, while the lengthy primary contest created heated divisions in the ranks, it made Obama a stronger, better-known candidate and burned up most of the media fuel surrounding the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. and William Ayers before the fall campaign. And then, of course, there was the luck of the economic collapse.
Mullet said Russell's spirit does, as well.

JANET NAPOLITANO came down with amnesia after she abandoned her job as governor of Arizona and moved to Washington, D.C., to be Homeland Security secretary. Ensconced in a Democratic administration, she forgot all the arguments she once used to demand that the Bush administration address immigration reform and reimburse Arizona for the costs of the broken border. Put in charge of Obama's effort to craft immigration reform, she couldn't get the thing out of neutral.
While there is no single, unifying agreement within the Republican Party with regard to civil unions, we do agree on one thing: we are the party of small government, personal freedom, and family values.

In an open letter published Friday on the UC Berkeley website, campus officials acknowledged that the Occupiers' actions "helped to raise the public profile of urban agriculture and generate constructive conversation about its value." Their tactics, which "we abhor," nevertheless "sharpened the college's focus" on existing plans for the area to be used for urban farming, according to the letter from Provost George Breslauer and Vice Chancellor John Wilton.

Affordable housing lawyer Rafael Mandelman has an affable approach. But when asked what he's for, he checked off all the San Francisco progressive boxes: a "wealth tax," historic preservation, public power, more tenant rights. This seat needs a more independent thinker.

We've always known plenty about the State House itself. Builders started work on it in 1772 and finished it about 10 years later. It served as the nation's capital between 1783 and 1784, and the Continental Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris there in 1784, ending the Revolutionary War.
Chatting at her neighborhood Curves Fitness Center in St. Paul, where she has earned a star on the wall for performing 1,000 workouts, Hempel talks about exercise, food, family and life with an animation that suggests unflagging enthusiasm, her conversation punctuated by laughter and the occasional "Oh!

But if stress persists — or is perceived as persisting — it's a different story. The adrenal glands release another hormone called cortisol, and cortisol increases appetite and may also ramp up motivation in general, including the motivation to eat. Once a stressful episode is over, cortisol levels should fall, but if the stress doesn't go away — or if a person's stress response gets stuck in the on position — cortisol may stay elevated.
His 1,800-foot walk on a two-inch cable will merge the Flying Wallendas family history with the colorful daredevil folklore of Niagara Falls that dates back more than 150 years, when the "Great Blondin" made regular high-wire trips across the Niagara River gorge, downstream of the falls.

Ryan's proposal aims to slash the deficit and the size of government while offering sharply lower tax rates in return for eliminating many popular tax breaks.

The trip is the latest chapter in a five-year effort to save the 80-year-old plant in the Highland Park neighborhood of St. Paul, which has produced the long-running Ranger pickup, a light-duty truck that hasn't been redesigned in years and is slated to end its U.S. run when the plant closes.

But the Norton case didn't fundamentally reorganize the city government, according to Jonathan Entin, a law and political science professor at Case Western Reserve University. And that could be enough to distinguish the Norton case from the Cuyahoga charter.
Guthman found that the committee had confiscated pages from a hotel registry that could have corroborated Rader's contention that he had not been in New York during the weeks in question. Guthman also found receipts, library records and bank deposit slips that showed that Rader had been in and around Seattle at the time.
It's difficult for me, as someone who consumed the Attitude Era live, to imagine Undertaker / HHH, in a Hell in a Cell, at WrestleMania, for the last time ... without it being the most violent match in recent memory. Despite the lack of blood in recent years, we will see a "crimson mask" or two (or three) in this matchup that will define a generation. Not only that, the violence we will be subjected to in this match will have an even greater impact because of how scarce it is in WWE today. This one won't be for the faint of heart.
In the current quarter, TriQuint said it expects revenues between $170 million and $185 million.
Cookson, a Republican, said the bill only seeks to keep any discussion of sexual orientation out of the classroom and doesn’t specifically mention homosexuality. He believes schools should focus on core subjects, such as math and science, and leave everything else to parents.

fighting terrorism is not finished and while we have satisfaction of bringing justice to a terrorist, the creed of terrorism still exists. We should not lower our guard at this time, as that's what the perpetrators of crimes against humanity count on. We all have to collaborate at local, national and international levels to defeat the terrorism. The fight will not be won in short period of time, there will be some failures, but we can not give up. The world is not fighting an army of a country, we are against a distorted ideology. It took years for these ideas to take roots and

THE LINCOLN LAWYER
I'm not the biggest fan of the horror genre, although I love "The Walking Dead" and "American Horror Story." But after watching both the hours that air tonight (the first of them twice), I find "The River" to be a slow slog through a ridiculous plot, with unappealing characters (except for Hope) and tired camera tricks. Even the exotic setting is wasted as scenes alternate between hand-held camera footage and what looks like security-cam tapes. The series is also heavily subtitled, if that bothers you.
Two 7-year-old children were wounded in separate shootings Thursday on the South Side, officials said.

He wanted to know all about living in St. Louis and what kind of fun things there were to do here. I probably mentioned the Cardinals or the Zoo, but I remember being surprised that he had never heard of the Admiral. You know, the famous Admiral, the world's biggest riverboat? No? You sure? Really? Another popular thing about the Admiral was its steam calliope, whose familiar shrill notes would echo for miles. That sounded really cool when heard from Bellerive Park or Jefferson Barracks, but it sure wasn't welcome music when the Saint Louis Symphony was performing a concert under the Arch.

The labor force shrank by 21,000, to 5.1 million. When job seekers get discouraged, they are no longer counted in the labor force, which makes unemployment look lower even if jobs don't increase.
Chris Fecarotta, standing outside Wednesday's Bulls game, says it was immediately obvious to him when he moved here nine months ago: "This is a football town."
It's true that Troutdale has refused to play ball. Except for a few warranted exceptions, the city parked at the edge of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area stands alone in missing a 2009 deadline for complying with Metro rules designed to protect water quality and wildlife habitat. The result now is that Metro has decided to consider enforcement actions that could cost Troutdale a boatload of money.
SLU's win over La Salle certainly wasn't a classic. Rick Majerus took me to task for saying it wasn't much to look at -- "If you like pretty basketball ..." he said. I don't know that I like pretty basketball, but 37 turnovers combined doesn't get your game tape sent to the Louvre.

As Basil came on the field for field goal work, coaches first raised their arms, asking the fans to attempt to rattle Basil with their voices. Then the fans were invited even closer, just yards away as Basil connected, making four of six attempts, with defensive lineman Johnathan Hankins celebrating after blocking one. Basil said he would have been worried about shanking one into the crowd only if he had been golfing.
Painter's grandfather, Francis Asbury Young, came to Arizona from Ohio by train in 1886 with his wife and 2-year-old son, Lawrence, Painter's father. "They homesteaded at 107th Avenue and Camelback Road on the Agua Fria River and talked about how the Indians here were friends of the White man."

IF THE clothes make the leading man, Luke Wilson is angling to play the handsome high school lit teacher -- you know, the one who made you cry when he read aloud from "A Separate Peace." He rarely veers from his Kennedy-era haircut and typically shows up at events in rumpled khakis or cords and a preppy blazer. Then, there's that squint. More musing than macho, Wilson has perfected a studied squint -- or is it a wince? -- that precedes his answers to the tough questions.

"I don't think it's on our radar because patients might have a lot more issues that they think are more pressing than that," Dr. Thy Nguyen Huskey said. "But if you can't swallow, you can't eat."
Romero also said it's hypocritical to try to limit the duration of protests "when we celebrate the occupation of Tahrir Square (the site of anti-government demonstrations in Cairo). Certainly no one was citing the Egyptians for their overnight, multiday protests. We ought not to criticize the Occupy movement for demonstrating their points of view with similar zeal."
Much of the St. Paul licensed general contractor's work involves buying, fixing up and reselling homes, so his income depends on keeping down expenses.
Hollie -- She sang "Rolling In The Deep" pretty well, but it lacked the emotion and feeling to put it over the top.

Beer Guy: This was my first trip to Five Guys, even though the place has been on my should-try list since it topped Consumer Reports' best-burger survey last year. Turns out, Five Guys lives up to the hype. The double-patty burger was the juiciest on our trail, despite being cooked to a chain-mandated well-done. I also liked the soft sesame-seed bun, which sopped up those burger juices while maintaining its structure. The fries: In case the stacks of peanut oil in the dining area and the peanut shells on the floor weren't reminder enough, the menu will tell you that the fries are cooked in cholesterol-free peanut oil. Our overflowing batch was a tad greasy, but the flavor and seasoning were top-cut.

In 2010, the district, in an effort to cut cost but keep Villarreal's benefits in tact, entered into the agreement to share his time - and compensation - with the Otay Water District. San Miguel, however, is solely responsible for his retirement benefits because he remains a San Miguel employee.
The cruising world started '08 with a strong push. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 2.5 million passengers sailed on 1,063 North American cruises in the second quarter of 2007, the highest level in the last four years. That number is a mere 20 percent of all 2007 cruisers - 12.6 million, per estimates by the Cruise Lines International Association, which represents the major cruise lines. To accommodate these vacationers, at least 12 new ships took to the seas.

Well, they have to avoid doing anything stupid. The spot is their's to lose. A loss to Richmond or Fordham wouldn't be fatal, but even one would hurt. Two would be costly.

Williams can't remember exactly when his father started abusing him and his brother. The passage of time has sanded down the rough edges of his memories. His father had always been a stern disciplinarian, someone who struggled to control his temper. But at some point, roughly around the time Williams was 9 years old and Ronald was 7, the hitting started to get worse. Williams, a A-student who was enrolled in several gifted programs, started to lash out. He felt like he didn't have anyone he could talk to. His grades plummeted, and he no longer wanted to play sports. One night, he and his brother decided they were going to run away. They spent the night sleeping in a park on one of the coldest nights of the year in Florida.

The national debate over health care and the affordable care act that has roiled the country may have some questioning the future of medical care, but it has not dimmed the hopes of thousands of medical students like Lewis.

Aspirin's not for everybody, so talk with your doc first. And if you notice a gnawing sensation or any digestion differences, call your doc, pronto.

• Five things to take from Lakers' 103-92 win over Trail Blazers -- Mark Medina, L.A. Times: The Lakers should complain to the media every 1 1/2 weeks. That way they'll play inspired basketball with lots of energy. That was evident in the team's ball movement; the Lakers cracked the 100-point mark for the fifth time this season and assisted on 18 of the 30 field goals. That was evident in the body language teammates showed after each basket, ranging from high fives, finger pointing and smiles. That was evident in the aggressiveness as the Lakers outrebounded Portland, 42-27.

Find compensations for the increased expense. Anne Banas, executive editor of SmarterTravel.com, thinks hotels may bring back the gas-card incentive. When fuel went up four years ago, many hotels offered customers a gas card or some compensation to help ease the pain. But, Banas said, make sure you do the math to ensure you're really getting a deal. Look, too, for extras that hotels will include that save you money.

Cutler said after the NFC title game that he didn't know who caused the injury, but it appeared to happen as he threw an incomplete pass from near his end zone with 4:11 left in the first half. Cutler was hit hard by two Green Bay pass rushers, including nose tackle B.J. Raji, who appeared to hit Cutler's left knee. Cutler stayed in for the rest of that eight-play series, which ended with a punt, and two more possessions sandwiched around the halftime intermission before his knee swelled up and became increasingly unstable.

Ed Wood. Sweeney Todd. Ichabod Crane. The Mad Hatter. The partnership between Tim Burton and his go-to actor is getting stale. Spin the wheel to pick a pop culture oddball, put "Johnny Depp is ..." in front of it, and start building sets. Just as the Adam McKay-Will Ferrell collaborations ran dry of wacky professions, the point of diminishing returns must arrive. And so it has with the drab "Dark Shadows." Never before have they attacked such uncertain material with so little gusto or levity. The film has a terminal case of the blahs.

øWhile the characters look different in Skylanders Cloud Patrol, it's too bad they all tend to have the same powers. In other words, switching between Skylanders is purely cosmetic. This is not the case with the console version of the game, Skylanders Spyro's Adventure. The only exception is the mobile game offers an "element of the day" bonus, where you'll get extra coins if you have and use a character based on that particular element, such as Earth, Air and Water.
Mr. Thompson of St. Louis and Mr. Hall of Jefferson City are Republican strategists based in Washington, D.C., who, in their spare time, developed a line of barbecue sauces.

Look out west: to Anaheim, where the addition of Albert Pujols means the Yankees no longer have sole claim to the best player of the generation in Alex Rodriguez ... and also no longer have the indisputable, impossible-to-top, worst contract in baseball. To Arlington, Texas, home of the first back-to-back AL champions since the Yankees finished their reign of 1998-2001, which added Yu Darvish, which was a strike away from winning the whole shebang a year ago.

I duplicated the combination with cauliflower, broccoli and Brussels sprouts. Although the pairings sounded odd, as each vegetable cooked and caramelized, the flavors became deeper and more complex.

From November 1979 until December 1982, the state lost about 131,000 jobs, equivalent to one-eighth of the state's supply. Not until December 1986 did jobs reach the earlier number, and forestry jobs never recovered. Two decades later, during the next deep recession in Oregon, manufacturing took a big blow. The state's strongest remaining manufacturing industry, high-tech, is based primarily in the Portland area.

The bottom line is this: I don't agree with "swarley" and other critics that Plain Dealer reporters were lazy or taking care of their friends.

On that night, the chefs also shaved purple asparagus ($12.50), which has a vaguely garlic-like flavor, into thin, crunchy strips and tossed them with pecorino cheese, loads of black pepper and citrus vinaigrette. On another night the salad might include a spring medley ($13) with dices of fennel, cauliflower lightly charred from the wood oven, chopped egg and a balanced vinaigrette that fuses the various components. Generally there are three salads on the menu, along with a crudo, which might include gossamer slices of local halibut ($13.50) topped with tiny coins of radish, mint, lemon verbena and delicate, spicy turnip greens.

"The President's stagnant economy remains the number one threat to workers in the United States, and spreading falsehoods about our budget isn't going to put a single American back to work," Lansing said.

Redfern said there is also movement toward bringing a constitutional amendment that voters could decide as early as November 2012.

It may turn out that the availability of land at Aberdeen Proving Ground is a plus, but it was also noted last week that APG has a major drawback insofar as it lacks anything approximating an exit ramp cloverleaf off I-95. Going back a generation to the 1970s when the post was at a high point in tank testing, traffic was notorious in the mornings and evenings as the drag race from the various gates across Aberdeen to I-95 clogged relatively narrow roads. The Route 22-Aberdeen Bypass helped, but even after the RIFs (reductions in force) of the 1980s, the Route 22-Beards Hill Road area remained a place to avoid after about 4:27 p.m. on weekdays.

Instead, expect the candidates to charge forward and eventually suggest that the problem was someone or something wasn't conservative enough.

He has starred on Broadway in a number of shows; most recently "American Idiot" and a Vegas revue of Queen music sanctioned by the men of Queen themselves. Giving up a career singing Green Day on the Great White Way in order to audition, he came out swinging with "We Are The Champions," a song on which even Freddie Mercury's voice comes dangerously close to cracking on the studio recording. Tony nailed all the high notes full-throated and powerfully. Cee Lo alone turned to see this performer and questioned whether his fellow judges' ears were burned off. We never get the reason why they passed. No time for losers, I guess.

“Man, a lot was said,” Dooling said. “Obviously I contributed tonight. It was in the 3-point category that people notice, but we did the job defensively. We were able to slow (Jeff) Teague down, Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, all of their players. That’s what stands out mostly in my mind.

The National Association for Business Economics said Monday that forecasters have raised their expectations for employment, new home construction and business spending this year. But they held on to their average prediction that America's gross domestic product, or GDP, will grow at a rate of 2.4 percent.

But now?
If he merely trots out the things he has already talked about — the unspecific package of a public-works infrastructure construction and repair bank and various tax incentives to business to resume rehiring — he will open himself to a new barrage of criticism. Nor can he afford, before the bipartisan joint session, to cast his appeal in the sharp partisan rhetoric against Republican obstruction in Congress that has marked much of his oratory since the debt-ceiling fiasco, widely read as a cave-in on his part.
Wildeboer would not say how many Martinrea employees will be affected by the Chrysler shutdown.
We turned to urban design specialist Vikas Mehta, an assistant professor of urban design and architecture at the University of South Florida, for the answers.

But he has never worked on any city projects.
"We were hopeful that some kind of middle ground could be reached short of us having to spend up to six figures to be compliant," she said. "Five months is not a realistic or reasonable time for us and for many others, like arenas, conventions centers, and other, smaller non-profits like churches, and anybody else using wireless microphones."
On the other hand, I found that, when Android did err, it had a more extensive and easier to use manner for correcting those mistakes than the iPhone did. Android was also more reliable; sometimes the iPhone returned no text at all.
