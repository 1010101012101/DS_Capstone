Schools receive about 79 cents for every dollar consumers spend on the lottery. The rest pays for prize money, lottery retailers and administrative costs. In fiscal year 2009, the lottery sent $255 million to Missouri schools, when its advertising budget was set at $1.3 million. In the current fiscal year, when the advertising budget is $9.3 million, about $259 million will go to schools.

"As written, the Senate health care bill allows taxpayer dollars, directly and indirectly, to pay for insurance plans that cover abortion," Nelson said in a statement.

» Analysis: A premium talent as a former Florida Mr. Football and Parade All-American, he started Purdue's first four games in 2010 before tearing his ACL but appeared in 10 games as a reserve last season. He completed 67.7 percent of his passes in 2010 but that percentage dropped more than 10 points last season and he has thrown nine interceptions and seven TDs at Purdue. He is splitting snaps in the spring.
The Pirates were at bat. Chris Carpenter was on the mound. One out. Two runners on base. Garrett Jones, a lefty, at the plate. Carpenter's first pitch was outside. His next pitch was low.

Yummy Snacking Pepper: This snack-size petite sweet pepper is nearly seedless. It ripens from green to yellow to an eye-catching apricot-orange or red.

The plant is pretty, too, in a container, according to the company's website.
The ultimate success or failure of grand executive ambition is measured by its effect on the other ideological side. Opposition to the Reagan revolution culminated in Walter Mondale – earnest and hapless. Resistance to the Great Society suffered a landslide defeat along with Barry Goldwater.
In general, servings are big and prices are not (an express lunch is offered at $7 or $8); thus it's an obvious choice for a large family gathering, cemented by the array of big, unclothed tables, and servers who aren't afraid to call you "hon." That doesn't mean Greektown Grille is lacking in sophistication: With cloth napkins (increasingly, a rarity), a full bar with expert mixologists on hand, and lovely mosaic glass artwork to its credit, Greektown Grille compares favorably with many of Clearwater's long-standing favorites, or even those fabled Greek Olympians to the north in Tarpon Springs. Yes, in Tarpon you may find a better lamb shank or spanakopita here or there, but Greektown Grille has entered the local arena exhibiting real know-how, and that's no myth.
Today, people are allegedly trading their Tide - but not for "another leading detergent."

"I'm very impressed with Dr. Thornton," LiPuma said today during an interview at Tri-C, shortly before the college's board of trustees approved renaming the building.
Thwarting those efforts appears to be the primary motivation for challenger David D. Hack, 71. He is a Vietnam veteran and military clothing entrepreneur who promises to focus "on Hudson alone" and vehemently opposes tax-sharing. This approach assumes that Hudson -- or any other community -- can wall itself off and remain immune from problems facing its neighbors in the region. That is wishful thinking.

Bankruptcy poses a smaller challenge when the product or service sold by a company does not involve a long-term relationship after the sale. If Campbell's Soup were to disappear tomorrow, the unused cans of soup in my kitchen would remain as valuable to me as they were when I bought them. The situation of an automaker is quite different. If Chrysler were to disappear next year, the value of my new Dodge Caravan would plummet. My fear about a Chrysler bankruptcy is that many consumers would respond by marking down the probability that a new Chrysler can be dependably maintained or profitably resold. This in turn would reduce the prices consumers are willing to pay for Chrysler vehicles. Consumers' pessimistic expectations would make the ultimate liquidation of Chrysler more certain.
Neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, affects babies who become addicted to drugs in utero -- especially opiates -- and go through withdrawal once they are living outside the womb. Symptoms include seizures and tremors, respiratory distress, vomiting and an inability to eat without becoming sick.

But Murff said he wondered whether these amenities would be any more popular than the average hotel fitness room. After all, most leisure travelers are on vacation from everything, including their workout routines. They expect to put on a few pounds while they're away. For those guests, he speculates, having a piece of exercise equipment delivered to their room may be an effective feel-good amenity that reassures them they are at least doing something to prevent weight gain.

But he also offered what he considered a hopeful sign: Rescue crews had found a cache of self-contained breathing devices from which several appeared to be missing, perhaps taken by the miners.
Second, I booked the airline ticket. A longtime Delta frequent flier, I cashed in 280,000 miles for a first-class "Round-the-World" ticket - might as well go in style.

"Rose was a beautiful girl, and when we met, I fell hard. But her mother said I was too young. She finally said I would have to provide a home for Rose to show I was man enough to get married. I built it next door to her house, though it was a problem getting the material up the hill. I tried several ways, all of them hard and slow. Finally I hit on one that worked. I loaded the gravel, lumber and cement into three wagons, each pulled by two horses. At the foot of the hill I unhitched two of the wagons and hitched all six horses onto the third wagon. It took six horses to get that wagon up the hill." Eventually the home was finished and he married Rose at nearby St. Paul's Church.

He finished two points and one rebound shy of matching career highs.

MacInnis was nearly 37 at the end of the 1999-2000 season. Pronger was still young at 25, but he'd already played five-plus NHL seasons and had plenty of experience. That's the thing about Pietrangelo and Shattenkirk; they've stepped up and carried much of the load, just the way MacInnis and Pronger did so long ago. But Shattenkirk is only 23, and Pietrangelo is 22.

The No. 2 overall draft pick played less than 12 minutes that night for the Minnesota Timberwolves, but he still looked so tired. The games kept coming and coming in this lockout-shortened season, offering Williams little time to catch his breath and even less practice time to work on his game.
In contrast, studies of Mr. Gates's leadership style suggest he followed a much more traditional path: He tried to meet the needs of consumers, not create them. Mr. Gates was far more collaborative than the imperial Mr. Jobs.

Kehoe was granted reconsideration, which is generally a routine courtesy. But Kehoe, a Democrat, is the chair of the influential Appropriations Committee and her measure is being supported by Senate President Pro Tempore Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento.

But the biggest, most immediate threat of all is one we've known about for years and could fix if we had the political will. We need to shore up the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta's deteriorating 1,300 mile levee system that protects the fresh supply of water that 65 percent of Californians drink. An earthquake could cause the utter failure of the levees in minutes, a catastrophe that could obscure other damage. A break in a strategic location would allow the salt water of the San Francisco Bay to pour into the fresh water of the Delta, destroying the fresh water that provides half of Silicon Valley's supply. This could happen any day. But the state holds the levees hostage to a broader and more controversial comprehensive water plan. It is an irresponsible gamble.
Not everyone was left so disgruntled. Other leaders, such as Clayton Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell, said they're happy with the final list and will tell people to vote for it.
NEW YORK – Ahmad Bradshaw coped with the loss of Brandon Jacobs when the Giants cut him last month. Then, when there seemed to be some indications Jacobs would be back with the team, Bradshaw got his hopes up they’d remain backfield mates.

… She should not have been driving — period. Even if the second accident didn't happen and she was just picked up for driving with a suspended DL, she should not have been driving.

In a small room crammed with big furniture, 94-year-old Jackson lay in a hospital bed, her right arm hugging a stuffed bunny in a Jesus Loves Me T-shirt. A small TV with rabbit ears next to the bed was tuned to The 700 Club, and a church choir sang as Lee placed her hands on her patient's abdomen and gently pressed, checking its firmness and for any pain. Jackson, her eyes barely open, said nothing.

There's no question that the Academy, a venerable organization that cherishes its traditions, faces challenges in making substantial changes. For example, the governors are selected branch by branch, with no one branch allowed more than three members on the board. New applicants are voted on only once a year. After a period of rapid growth and relaxed standards for admission in the 1990s, new memberships were limited and requirements were made stricter in 2004. Today, a certain number of work credits as well as sponsorship by two current members, an endorsement of a branch committee or an Oscar nomination are necessary before an applicant is even considered. Membership is for life.

Elway also can offer Manning a roadmap on how to maintain his sanity in a geographically isolated, Broncos-crazy town that lives and dies with its football team. At one point in his career, Elway complained about being in a "fishbowl," and that was especially true when there were two newspapers at war. Eventually, though, he found a way to maintain a semblance of privacy, something Manning protects vigorously.
"He's set on making a club -- and not just making a club, but being a difference-maker," he said. "It might not be in the next year or two, but I believe he will be a guy that, before it's said and done, people will realize what they have in him.
Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Lori Grifa showed up to answer questions about lowering the cap from 4 percent to 2.5 percent and eliminating most of its exemptions, as Christie has proposed.

He has a 1.86 ERA after two starts. I loved when the Rockies gambled by taking Matzek. Now, they need this investment to pay dividends. Matzek was the best left-handed prep pitcher in California since Cole Hamels. Barring injury, he needs to become a good big-league starter.

Should a reporter simply say that the justices asked skeptical questions, or try to give the reader his informed impression about what they may portend for the resolution of the case? In this case, lamentably, the second option seems to be the appropriate one. But maybe there's one devil's advocate who will rule on the side of the angels.
The Answer: Many companies regard a person's credit score as an indicator of whether he will be a responsible and reliable employee.

State law is designed to prevent people who commit significant crimes from working in nursing homes or other care settings. Health care workers undergo criminal background checks, but their new employers can ask the Health Department to overlook previous wrongdoing and allow them to work. There's nothing in the law that requires regulators or caregivers to disclose such variances, leaving seniors or their loved ones largely in the dark about who may be caring for them. The state Department of Human Services can also grant exceptions to individual workers.

He had been making $50,000 worth of bath salts a month. But Missouri recently banned chemicals found in synthetic drugs. Now, Seratt is at least temporarily out of that business while he waits for a court ruling on lawsuits he filed seeking to overturn the state law. In the meantime, he is producing a new line of powders and herb products that he contends are "all natural or FDA-approved."

As Mr. Santorum's rise to the top of the GOP field demonstrates, this "I-am-the-real-religious-candidate" strategy works. It worked for Zia-ul-Haq when he won the 1984 referendum by asking Pakistanis, "Do you wish Pakistan to be an Islamic state?" And it seems to be working for Mr. Santorum as he is essentially asking GOP primary voters, "Do you wish America to be a Christian state?"

Of all the TV series that have won the coveted post-Super Bowl slot, I can't think of a more unlikely -- and therefore crazily inspired -- choice than "Glee." It's positively subversive that the most macho of sporting events should be followed by a TV show that celebrates show tunes, music geeks, nerd power and the kind of wholehearted embrace of gay identity that you just don't see much in the world of professional football. The Sunday "Glee" episode features such highlights as the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band dressed as zombies for a mash-up of "Thriller" and the Yeah Yeah Yeah's "Heads Will Roll." I. Can't. Wait. Obviously, start time is a tad flexible, but "Glee" is expected to begin around 7:30 p.m., on Fox (KPTV/12).

Camp Curry: Founded in 1899 by Indiana schoolteachers David and Jenny Curry, Camp Curry's original concept was to provide affordable room and board for weary travelers. True to that vision, Camp Curry still offers no-frills accommodations in canvas tents trimmed by green wood. The tent cabins are a bit drafty but provide a good, low-cost way to stay in the park. Tent cabins lack private bathrooms; some have heaters for late fall. The usual layout is simple: two beds, a nightstand and a lamp. Located next to the front porch is a bear-safe locker for your food. During the 1920s, the camp offered music, dancing and entertainment; today, the amphitheater is mostly used for ranger talks and some light entertainment. There's a food court with a diverse menu that offers Mexican food, pizza, burgers and hot dogs and a cafeteria nearby. Contact: (801) 559-4884, www.yosemitepark.com/Accommodations.aspx

"We're in a more pronounced recovery here," he said. GM now expects U.S. industry-wide sales of 14 million to 14.5 million this year. That's still lower than the peak of 17 million in 2005, but better than the 2009 downturn, when 10.6 million new vehicles were sold.

The St. Louis Regional Sporting Spaniel Club, of which Takmajian is a member, is working to get official American Kennel Club recognition. That would enable the club to hold "hunt tests," at which the dogs prove their abilities in front of judges. If the dogs demonstrate their skill to 'scent," flush and retrieve with the right degree of accuracy and discipline, they earn ribbons. If they get enough ribbons, they earn "junior," 'senior" or "master" titles, thereby proving the many hours of training that have honed their instincts and transformed them from tail-wagging fur balls into lean, speedy killing accomplices. This, the organizers hope, will help cement the spaniel's reputation here as a good, serious hunting dog.

Such focus group reactions are “greater than what you see in real life” because people assembled in a conference room and instructed to watch a speech pay considerably more attention than the average viewer, noted Greenberg, who has conducted such studies for each State of the Union speech dating back to the Bill Clinton administration. Still, the reactions provide a rough gauge of the speech’s overall impact, he said.
"What was the butcher knife in the grass for? To threaten me in case he lost his other weapons? To lighten his load? Or to cut me up after he killed me in my car and throw my parts to the fishes before burning the car?" the newspaper quoted Smith as saying. "In the context of what I know, I suspect the latter. The billfold theft was a front for an intended assassination that almost succeeded."

Here it is: the song that every band in the entire Britpop movement of the '90s was trying to write. At this point, I doubt Damon Albarn would bother to deny it. Forget the "psychedelic" tag -- back then, all it meant was that the band threw a little flanger on the bridge. There was nothing indulgent about the Small Faces. They specialized in tight pop songs, like this one.

By the time the ECB chiefs met in Lisbon, the euro zone was in danger of coming unglued. Two weeks earlier, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou had gone on national television from the remote Mediterranean island of Kastelorizo to publicly ask Europe for help.

Description: After its overhaul in 2003, "JK" became the "it" playground for Pacific Heights and Richmond District moms and their nannies. It's one of the loveliest settings for a playground in all of San Francisco, if not the Bay Area: sunny and sheltered, surrounded by softball and soccer fields, with the verdant Presidio as a backdrop. On the playground itself, a mini-climbing wall, spinning cups, and a spiderweb dome are a few of the highlights.

Another cause for Democratic optimism is the welcome improvement in the economy. Still, it remains in dire straits.

The four kickers selected over the weekend represented the most since the league reduced the draft to seven rounds in 1994. It was only one fewer, in fact, than had been picked in the previous four drafts combined. In the 18 drafts 1994-2011, the average number of kickers picked in seven rounds was 1.8, and in six of those years, there was one or none. The previous two years, Alex Henery, tabbed by Philadelphia in the fourth round in 2011, was the lone kicker selected.

5. Spritz on a toning spray (this step is optional but obviously super quick) to set your makeup, and you are out the door. I like the cool mist of the spray because I like anything that adds hydration, and it does seem to 'set" my makeup. Even without the eye routine, a little spray is nice even if you just fill a spray bottle with filtered water. Our Webster Groves supermodel Karlie Kloss recommended Caudalie Beauty Elixir ($16 for a 1-ounce bottle at Sephora) in the February edition of Teen Vogue, but don't let the "teen" shout-out fool you. The mist is actually formulated for "mature" skin and is designed to smooth skin, tighten pores and stimulate microcirculation (whatever that means, it sounds good, right?). I'm a fan of M.A.C's Fix+ spray of water and vitamins ($10 at M.A.C Cosmetic counters).

Clearly, Boorstin was a scold and a culturally conservative one at that. He detested the manufactured, the contrived and the confected, and he coined a term that was so widely embraced it would become the subtitle of the book's paperback edition: "A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America." The pseudo-event was a "happening" that was not spontaneous but that was designed precisely to be reported or reproduced. A news conference, a photo-op, a movie premiere, an award ceremony, even a presidential debate — all these are staged, in his analysis, simply to get media attention or, in postmodernist terms, to get attention for attention's sake. They have no intrinsic value or at least not the intrinsic value they purport to have. Similarly, a celebrity is a "human pseudo-event" — a personality who is devoid of any intrinsic value save the value of being advertised.

After winning two games in a row by three points, the Gladiators were walking a tightrope. They're a well-rounded, well-coached, fundamentally sound team that's been winning games by playing tough and not making a bunch of mistakes.

Like criminals in a blackout, anonymous reviewers, in the book's words, "loot the intellectual property of the authors whose work they review" (by delaying publication while pinching the ideas for their own projects) and "damage or destroy the reviewed authors' property" (by denying their competitors grants and publications).

The seeds have a sedative effect but can also cause vomiting. The flowers and roots have usefulness in treating congestion but only if administered in proper proportions. The entire plant contains too much risk of toxicity for anyone but a trained herbalist to use.

Triathlons can be an expensive sport to jump into with all the equipment. But people will spend $3,000 on a pair of race wheels that might save them 30 seconds to a minute, but they won't practice their transitions. Probably one of the best buys for your money is a pair of elastic laces for your shoes. You just throw those on your shoes, and you can make them fit like slippers. Another one of the big hurdles that really separates the really good transition people is learning to leave your shoes on your bike when you get off your bike. But that does take quite a bit of practice. But it's well worth it because it makes you look cool.

What much of the moviegoing world does not realize is that Astaire had a remarkable life before Hollywood, one in which his dancing partner was his sister Adele. She left the stage in March 1932 to marry an Englishman, Lord Charles Cavendish, and pretty much disappeared from view. Today her name is probably best known to crossword-puzzle solvers, for whom the clue "Dancing Astaire" must be answered with "Adele" when only five letters are available. Unlike her brother, who left a vast archive of films, television appearances and — by no means least — superb recordings of the dozens of classic American songs that were written for him by the likes of George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and others, Adele left almost no trail beyond the memories of those who saw her on stage, most of whom by now are dead. You can, and should, go to YouTube and listen to her and Fred singing"Fascinating Rhythm" — with powerful piano accompaniment by George Gershwin (!) — but that's about it.
