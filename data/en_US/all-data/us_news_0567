Our first stop, the 15,000-square-foot Walkabout Waters, offered something for all three kids. For 6-year-old Cameron, there was a shallow pool for splashing around and swimming. For the older kids, there was an elaborate network of ladders, rope bridges and slides where they could explore, shoot water cannons and get doused by two gigantic water buckets that tipped every five minutes or so, dumping their load from about 60 feet up.
Board members acknowledged the switch could be disruptive to many parents and students, who had grown to cherish a schedule that sent elementary kids to school for nine weeks on and three weeks off.
That involvement -- geothermal heating and cooling, quality windows, the right amount of insulation, solar attic fans -- later inspired him to start a company to create environmentally sound homes, which translates into more comfort and less drafts during both the summer and winter weather as well as lower utility bills.

Such alms amount to the toll that pays for the light bill.

Reasons for optimism: The Ducks rotated players so often on defense, especially along the line, that it almost became difficult to distinguish starters from reserves. The result is a 2011 defensive front that although minus some impact players, most notably defensive tackles Brandon Bair and Zac Clark, and defensive end Kenny Rowe, has plenty of experience to build upon. Six veteran players appeared in all 13 games in 2010 and have a 109 games of combined experience. Defensive ends Turner and Jordan each had 33 tackles and combined for 11 tackles for loss and 4 ½ sacks last season. Turner will be the leader of the group and Jordan, at 6-foot-7, 231 pounds, is a converted wide receiver the team would like to see develop into the disruptive, drop end Rowe was. Inside, Heimuli and Keliikipi enter camp as starters at defensive tackle. Ebert, a junior college transfer out of Iowa Western C.C., could instantly work his way into the rotation.

The biggest threat to Republicans, who are currently flushed with victory, is, McCarthy thinks, the delusion that "they won the election. They didn't win anything." Rather, Democrats got themselves fired. McCarthy is too polite to say that the Democrats were terminated because they, like the president, misread the 2008 elections as much more than the electorate's pink slip for Republicans who were spendthrifts at home and blunderers abroad.

In return for funding projects that maintain their authentic qualities and natural beauty while developing unintrusive tourism facilities, the government monitors the town's adherence to certain requirements. They must maintain their traditional architecture, promote local festivals, support their artisans and provide a minimum standard of tourist services. The specifics are many and complex, and several towns have been de-listed for failing to comply.

The NATO force deployed in the east is primarily made up of Americans.
One of the more ambitious projects is a "moss mural" that Vorderbruggen is trying to grow on a wall outside the Rainbow Chinese restaurant at 2739 Nicollet.

The words were applied with moss spores mixed into yogurt, beer and "retention gel," a glop that has to be watered pretty much every day. That job has fallen to Vorderbruggen.

That I can always get behind! But we definitely walked a pretty thin line sometimes.…"

Baltimore prosecutors have too often had trouble convincing juries that city police were trustworthy, and this won't help. Stacked on top of the recent convictions of several officers in a towing kickback scheme, the guilty plea of an officer who ran a drug ring while on duty — sometimes out of the Northwestern District parking lot — and the conviction of another officer who shot an unarmed Marine veteran in a drunken, off-duty confrontation, it may not take much for Mr. Neverdon to sow doubts. Phylicia Barnes' family deserves justice in this case. It would be simply tragic if a police officer's panic over his own missing daughter prevented them from getting it.

It's really going to be up to him and how he improves to see how much playing time he gets. We expect him to play and be productive for us."

As the lead steadily grew for Zumwalt West, Jones helped to build the lead every step of the way.
Two years ago I spent a month in France, and would tell people I was from Saint Louis, MO. Young people had never heard of St. Louis, even though I told them it was named for a French king/saint. Older people would say "arch" or make an arch with their hands. However, many had heard of Washington University St. Louis because of BBC TV programs in France about the brain research being done here.
One trait these two veteran politicians share is a high level of competence. It's unfortunate they are running for the same statewide office. Either of these two candidates, who both offer legislative experience and straight-shooter reputations, could do a capable job as secretary of state.
After opening a slew of Mat Kearney shows last week on the West Coast, he returned home to open for Rodrigo y Gabriela at the 1stBank Center earlier this week.

Whether on Team Cena or Team Rock, it has to be hard to walk away from this documentary without an increased sense of respect for the dedication and accomplishments of each man.
 Businesses in specialized fields sometimes have to get similar certifications for their employees from different state and local agencies. For example, technicians at SunWest Engineering Constructors, a Pomona company that builds, maintains and inspects fuel systems, must hold some 15 government certifications, on top of company-required ones. CEO Pamela Lawrence says she spends $3,000 a year to keep each employee in compliance with state regulations.

That doesn't cover all of the story problems with "The Road," but it goes a long way toward covering them up.
Arrests have been falling dramatically, however, in recent years, especially in Arizona. The 123,000 illegal immigrants arrested in the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector last year represents a 42 percent decrease from the 212,202 illegal immigrants arrested the year before, and an 80 percent decline from 616,000 arrests in 2000.

The Blues got better as the game went along. They finished the second period with a flourish but still trailed 1-0 entering the third. They continued banging away until they had a 2-1 lead.
Fear not. You still get your money's worth. The new P90X is just as daunting as the old one, if not more so. It's got exercises I can't even think about doing, let alone sustain as long as Horton and friends do. And I haven't even watched all the videos yet.
The team will have a table set up at Farrington Stadium throughout the Utah series to collect basic needs for children such as clothing, school supplies, books and toys. Donations can also be made inside the Carson Student-Athlete Center.
Another likely impact is more hotly contested general elections, said Jessica Levinson, a visiting associate clinical professor at Loyola Law School who is involved in political reform work. That's because districts with high numbers of people registered to one party could see two candidates from that party duke it out in November.
American Assets Trust Inc. bought the portfolio for $92 million, but Ashforth still manages the buildings, and Langley will take over their management.

One of my friends is a curryholic. That's right, my pal Colleen DeBaise is addicted to curry, particularly Thai curry. I think she likes curry more than I like chocolate. She even traveled in April from her home in New York to Bangkok to attend a week-long cooking class where she learned to make such things as red curry of duck (gaeng phed ped yaang).
With its Pacific Northwest setting, murky lighting and plentiful rain, "Chronicle" plays like an extended episode of "The X-Files" might; DeHaan in particular comes off like one of the series' more-memorable characters. That's a compliment. It isn't a great movie, but one could imagine -- and hope -- that it becomes a cult favorite, outlasting other films of its ilk.
His hard work has been worth it, he said, and he feels "as close to 100 percent" for the first time in four state tournaments.
Their remodeling plan nixed a formal dining room. Instead they placed the refurbished table and chairs, which Albertsson's parents brought back from Sweden, at the far end of the kitchen. The furniture's clean lines complement the Ikea kitchen cabinets they installed above Calcutta marble countertops. Another Scandinavian touch is the use of open stainless steel shelves to display stacks of plates.
Three men have been charged with sex trafficking and solicitation, and seven others were arrested. Police Inspector Todd Milburn said the ring was fairly sophisticated, using the Internet to promote the business.
The "Iron Chef"-style contest will be judged by event co-chair Katrina Basile; Indianapolis attorney Jan Carroll; real-estate businessman Joe Everhart; Robert Whitt, executive director of White River State Park; and one party attendee, who will be chosen randomly at the event, to be held at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Indiana Landmarks Center, 1201 Central Ave.

Telegrams between the couturier and the German-American actress reveal the intimacy of their relationship. In one of the exhibit's highlights, Dietrich's famous dalliances with androgyny are demonstrated by her men's clothing bills that are on display. One receipt for four men's sweaters clocks up an extravagant 19,000 francs (the equivalent of $4,000 today).
Ms. Newhouse blames this same lack of communication between sponsors and users for today's often imperfect results. A "build it and they will come" mentality has popularized the idea of a "destination" building that will attract tourism and serve as an economic regenerator for depressed areas, a concept that began, iconographically, with the sail-like shapes of the Sydney Opera House in 1973 and, economically, with the Bilbao Guggenheim's revitalization, in the late 1990s, of a dying industrial city in Spain.
“It allowed us to stay under the 4 percent cap without totally eviscerating municipal staff and services,” Dugan said at a township committee meeting Tuesday night.

That role figures to be at leadoff where the Angels' offensive dysfunction has started. Their leadoff hitters combined for a .195 average and .250 on-base percentage through the first 20 games this season. Trout started at leadoff just once in his 32 starts with the Angels last season. But he was hitting .403 with a .467 on-base percentage and 21 runs scored in 20 games at Triple-A Salt Lake – all as the Bees' leadoff hitter – before his promotion and Angels manager Mike Scioscia put him in Saturday's lineup at leadoff.

The report on the program used an example of a driver who paid $125 for each of the two devices installed on the cars in his family, a maintenance fee of $3.50 a day on each and other fees for regular tests to make sure the devices were properly working. The costs can be an obstacle to participation for some people, but for others, it's better than being idle -- and restless -- at home or dependent on others to get around.
Will ownership assess the moves made by general manager Doug Wilson in the last 10 months and decide someone else should do his job? Will the general manager stick with coach Todd McLellan?

Beverages: Sodas, beer and a range of cocktails. Emphasis on tequila — they only have one type each of red and white wine.
All these years, I have managed to camouflage my symptoms — although the emotional uncertainty follows me about like a second shadow. When I put on my makeup, I do it one feature at a time so I do not have to consider my face in its entirety. Hairdressers lose me as a customer the moment they spin my chair so that I'm forced to look in the mirror. I shop for clothing in stores that have communal dressing rooms so that I can rely on feedback from others rather than acknowledge my own image.
The last time the government recorded an annual surplus was 2001. Deficits returned after President George W. Bush won approval for broad tax cuts, pushed a major drug benefit program for seniors and launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Marsh also attributed the health of Johnson County residents to the abundance of parks, trails and other recreational opportunities.
Almost everyone seemed to agree on one thing: The Queen Victoria is a beautiful ship with elements of Victorian decor - marble and mosaics and crystal chandeliers - and touches of Art Deco and Art Nouveau. It's smaller and cozier than the Queen Mary 2. The Queen Victoria occupies a different niche, the captain said: "It's intimate, a ship where people can get to know people."
The Colts are counting on him to have that same impact. He's not that far removed from playing; he officially retired before the 2011 NFL season because of injuries. And he was a decent player in his time with the Colts and Titans, leading both in tackles, including a career-best 145 for the Colts in 2003.
The tiny church, which only seats about 120 people, set up speakers in its courtyard for another 120 or so who wanted to stay for the service but couldn’t fit inside.
I was just reading some editorial about how President Barack Obama is so naive and goes around the world apologizing for past American actions. The premise is that our foreign policy is in shambles because of him. That is so naive.

The philosophical divide between mainstream hawks and mainstream doves is hardly absolute. President Obama ordered the bombing of Libya and the killing of Osama bin Laden. In his Nobel Peace Prize speech, Mr. Obama wisely, albeit awkwardly, conceded that the aphorism "violence never solved anything" is wrong. "To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism -- it is a recognition of history, the imperfections of man and the limits of reason."

The surgeon uses a CT scan to decide ahead of time where the implant will go, then uploads that plan to the boxy, one-armed robot. In the operating room, when it comes time to shape the bone, the surgeon guides the robot's drill by hand — but when it gets close to the edge of the planned cavity, the robot offers some resistance and won't let the doctor cut beyond the planned space.

They are short phrases that can be added to statements to turn them into questions that get your prospective customer to start saying yes long before you go for the close. You ask these little questions throughout your sales presentation to engage your customers and get them used to saying yes. Psychologically, they will then be more likely to say yes when you ask for the sale.

Feelings among coaches in the Gateway Athletic Conference regarding expansion to include Winfield and Orchard Farm generally have been positive. But there are some coaches who understand some things will be different and that change isn't always good.
At age 44, Bullock thought she had left behind comedies such as "Two Weeks Notice," which she defends as the last good romance that she was offered. But the cynical script for her new flick "The Proposal" (opening Friday) changed her mind, because she would get to play the kind of role she always wanted: a bitch.

Which isn't to say that there aren't kids who face terrible cases of bullying. The immensely powerful and highly acclaimed documentary "Bully," whose makers hope to create a nationwide movement against the "bullying crisis," opens in selected theaters this weekend. The film follows the harrowing experiences of a handful of victims of harassment, including two who killed themselves in desperation. It is, above all, a damning indictment of ineffectual and indifferent school officials. No viewer can watch the abuse endured by kids such as Alex, a 13-year-old social misfit in Sioux City, Iowa, or Kelby, a 14-year-old lesbian in small-town Oklahoma, without feeling angry and motivated to change youth culture and the school officials who turn a blind eye.

The takeaway: Southern Miss received a ticket to the dance for the first time since 1991 despite a 5-5 finish. Neil Watson leads the team in scoring and assists. LaShay Page (11.5 ppg) is the Golden Eagles' main deep threat, with 72 3s this season. Former Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy, who resigned amid problems with alcohol, has turned Southern Miss around. The Golden Eagles have won at least 20 games three straight years.

The tower's lowered assessment will mean that city public schools and other tax-supported entities will take a slight hit, Bushmeyer acknowledged. But he noted that while citywide reassessments in 2009 and 2011 produced generally lower property values - and lower tax bills - state law allows some taxing districts to raise rates to make up lost revenue.

career expectations. It has not been a stellar season for the switch-hitting shortstop, and that was true with the Dodgers as it has been with the Cardinals. But he can bring the glove. Since his first inning with the Cardinals, Furcal has improved his plus/minus scores to his right and to his left. He has, as you probably saw, increased the range the Cardinals have at shortstop, to the position's left and to the right.
Funny, after all these years, one truth still rings clear: No one can save us from us but us.
2005 Nivole Moscato d'Asti by Michele Chiarlo, Piedmont, Italy ($14-$16, half bottle) - The color is a superfine mousse, light gold and shiny.

"She was scheduled to go to Spain next week," he said. "She was still performing. At the Blues Awards in Memphis a few weeks ago, she was absolutely glowing.

For the readers who wonder how we do the things we do, the answer at the World Series is: with desperation and prayer.
Much of the argument Tuesday centered around the conservative justices casting about for what bright line can be drawn to determine the extent of Congress' powers to regulate interstate commerce. But the court's long-standing interpretation of the Commerce Clause has been broad. Not every check on the power of Congress is constitutional; some are political. We are in the midst of a presidential election in which the incumbent has pledged to uphold and execute the Affordable Care Act, and all of his prospective Republican opponents have pledged to repeal it. The people will have the power to decide the appropriateness of this regulation at the ballot box, and that is the proper venue for it.
For the past several years, fans have been critical of the creative team's treatment of John Cena. Some fans have misdirected their gripes toward Cena himself, but he wasn't the one making booking decisions.

The denim theme came from female legislators in Italy who began wearing denim to protest a Supreme Court decision there in 1998 that overturned a rape conviction because the victim was wearing tight jeans, the release states. The court argued the victim "must have necessarily helped her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual."

"You can shoot 100 photos, and maybe only one captures a personality," he said. "Portrait art can instill that human quality that a camera can't.

Ms. Jacobs said, "Employees have not received any cost-of-living increases or raises in the past four fiscal years." True. But the 2011 CAFR also reported that per capita personal income in the city has dropped to $43,999 in 2010, the most-recent year reported, from $51,887 in 2007.

It seemed to be ripe for the losing. The Kings seemingly try to pry defeat from the jaws of victory quite often. They’ll fight hard for three quarters, get themselves a nice lead and then completely fall apart in the fourth quarter. It’s almost like clockwork.

The editor of Washington's leading gay newspaper was gay-bashed in Amsterdam, “the most tolerant city in Europe,” but by Muslims rather than the pasty rednecks who killed Matthew Shepard, so liberals don't have a dog in this fight.

The U.S. economy is expected to slow later this year, dragged down by slowing global growth, rising anxiety about the elections and the specter of gridlock in Washington over urgent tax, spending and debt deadlines. The Bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and the payroll tax cut of the past two years expire at year's end, when last year's debt deal also will force across-the-board cuts in federal spending unless Congress and the president strike new deals, but there's no consensus on that.
