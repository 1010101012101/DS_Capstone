I didn't get invited to New York for the draft. Everyone says they are surprised about it. I'm cool with it though. It would have been awesome to be one of the 26 players there and be part of the tradition of going to New York and being called up on stage to hold a jersey. But this way I get to spend the day with my family and friends.

The gap between UConn and Butler took a while to become apparent, but it eventually did. In the first half, if you believed the popular story line leading up to the game, there was, indeed, the good, the bad and the ugly. The good was little Butler, representing all the little guys in college basketball. The bad was Connecticut, which barely avoided those NCAA sanctions that might have kept it out of this tournament in the first place. And the ugly? Well, that was the game itself.

Walk's tour, which he will lead again Thursday, is intended to introduce city people to nature, said Leslee Spraggins, director of The Nature Conservancy in Illinois. The conservancy periodically teams up with the Lurie Garden, whose staffers gave the plant tour, for urban nature programs. It is a fit pairing, Spraggins said: the Conservancy is a part owner and manager of the Indian Boundary Prairies near south suburban Markham, which helped inspire the native plantings in the Lurie Garden.

The Oregon football cards were a team promotion, said Kira Homo, electronic records archivist at the University of Oregon. Homo confirmed that kids who collected the full set of 20 from 1953 – and possibly the sets from the two other years in which they were issued – could redeem it for a game ticket. That could explain why so few of the cards are in fans' hands today.

It's also encouraging that the fire union agreed to overhaul its overtime rules, which should save taxpayers millions of dollars a year. One change requires that firefighters, unlike what often happened in the past, will not get overtime for simply working a shift that occurred in a week when they also took a vacation day. Now, Schulte says, firefighters will get overtime pay only when they actually work overtime. Most working people would find that reasonable, even expected.

Joining the lobster-squid drama together with its family aftermath allows us to view Cowperwood as a man-child of desire.

Memory, or the lack of it, is at the story's center. A head injury has left the young hero, Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), impaired in maddening ways. Like Leonard in "Memento," Chris, who works as a night janitor at a bank, has such fleeting short-term memory that he can manage his life only by making entries on an endless to-do list. But the resemblances to Christopher Nolan's virtuoso puzzle picture are outweighed by the differences, for "The Lookout" is a straight-ahead drama, perfectly accessible though psychologically intricate, coupled shrewdly to a crime thriller.

There are plenty of ways to rationalize borrowing against your retirement account balance, but the real cost is the loss of potential earnings on a tax-deferred basis in your run up to retirement. And it's the intangible nature of this lost future income that undoubtedly makes the consequences of borrowing much harder for many to appreciate.

People ought to get off PPIs from time to time to see if they truly need long-term treatment. They can use other medicines, like Maalox, Tums or Rolaids. Avoiding foods that stimulate acid production is another worthwhile treatment. Those foods include chocolate, peppermint, spicy food, citrus fruit, tomatoes, alcohol and caffeine. Elevating the head of the bed with 6-inch blocks under the bedposts is helpful.

øE Ink screens like the one on the Nook, as well as those on Amazon's rival Kindle devices, do a terrific job of replicating the experience of reading on real paper. And unlike the Apple iPad and other tablets, they are easy to make out in the bright outdoors. But up to now, such screens were rendered useless without a light, same as a physical book.

Whether Hulu can grow into a major force or not, it's already become a pretty cool place to hang out. Its technology is good enough that Veoh and other popular sites such as Fancast frequently embed Hulu shows on their pages. The contents are helpfully alphabetized on a master list, where you might find more than one hidden treasure (egad, the short-lived '70s western "Alias Smith and Jones"?). You can even search for shows that Hulu doesn't have, and the site will direct you to where you can find them.

For-profit nursing home operators cried foul in a recent television commercial, which urged Ohioans to lobby state senators to restore some of the funding.

Comparatively, single-ticket sales for "Jersey Boys" were 38 percent of total sales after that first week.

Seen one way, the film-noir heroine is just another exhibit in Hollywood’s constant — and continuing — madonna/whore treatment of female characters.

A: That's a great question. I don't know the answer. I don't know why Nike for instance doesn't spawn innovation in architecture. Ziba has played its role -- it hired John (Holmes, a principal at Holst). It's really about how a company sees themselves.
The statement is evidently to address that poor guy's saga in response to The Watchdog request. However, the first 60% of their statement pats themselves on the back for their drug and weapons bust, including a bunch of minutae about the drugs and Mr. Chong's admission that he was at the location to "get high with his friends". Not pertinent to the issue and he was not even charged, so who cares.

False. Attempts to remove splinters by pulling can leave fragments that are more difficult to remove and likely to cause infection. It's better to use a sterile needle to scrape away overlying skin to expose the splinter before lifting it out with the needle tip or a clean tweezers. Watch for signs of infection: increasing pain, foul odor, colored pus, red streaks or fever. Long splinters that penetrate deeper tissues probably warrant a doctor visit, especially if you suspect fragments have broken off inside.

Becky is working with a print with numbers on it, to make a skirt. Laura Kathleen thinks it looks like "Judy Jetson with a vacuum cleaner." In a little girl talk with Anya in the lunchroom, Laura Kathleen continues to slag Becky's design. Becky walks in on this chat, and Laura Kathleen adds that Becky's skirt could read a little bit math teacher. Becky surmises that if Laura Kathleen is in here consorting with the enemy team, she could be trying to throw Becky under the bus. And that Old Project Express Bus Line No. 9 is always just around the corner, as we know, belching fumes and waiting to roll over some unsuspecting designer caught with her seams showing.

She spoke to a tough room that night — the Bedford Hills inmates were both victims and perpetrators of violence, impatient and curious. Adrienne's book, "Of Woman Born," had been recently published — and the uncompromising revisionist view of motherhood in its pages was the subject of her talk.

The neighborhood's centerpiece is the turntable for the Powell-Hyde cable car line. Crowds wait in line to take the lurching, clanking pleasure ride over to Market Street. The lines in turn attract squadrons of street musicians and guys who paint themselves silver and stand around waiting for you to drop a dollar in their collection box. But the late autumn weather thins the crowds and those working them. It's a more sedate experience compared to July.

Filner's best idea is the immediate imposition of a $100,000 cap on the pensions of high-paid managers, whose retirement benefits are not locked in by collective bargaining agreements. Another good idea is his call for a five-year contract with employee unions to try to lock in salary costs, helping keep down the long-term pension tab for those with guaranteed retirement benefits.

Experts on China saw two potential ways to resolve the crisis over Mr. Chen. One would be for Beijing to let the blind human-rights lawyer and his family emigrate to the U.S. The other would see Mr. Chen end his apparent stay under U.S. protection in exchange for guarantees from China that he wouldn't be arrested or harassed if he remained inside the country.

Two years ago at Pebble Beach when a similar number of tickets were sold daily, elbow room was scarce. One USGA official now admits it was probably too many people for the course to handle. But the thinking is that Olympic will accommodate the crowds better. Here's why: Olympic has no ocean-edge holes that confine spectator access to one side of fairways. And compared to the 1998 Open setup, the USGA is constructing 14,000 new grandstand seats. Olympic members also authorized the removal of substantial trees -- including dozens that came out during a major redo of the eighth hole, a par 3 that has been rebuilt so that a few thousand people can fill up the side of a hill overlooking the green.
The European Central Bank's roughly €1 trillion ($1.31 trillion) of emergency loans caused interest rates of troubled euro-zone countries to plummet earlier this year, easing fears about Europe's debt crisis. But lately rates have again been marching higher.

Second only to reading was my love of crafting. I grew up when home economics classes were a big part of junior high curriculum and practically every home had a sewing machine. My catalog included every crafting cliché: hand-sewn aprons, needlepoint pillows, crewel embroidery doorstops, knitted afghan squares, decoupaged recipe card boxes and the always-popular macrame jute plant holders. In college I majored in English and read Shakespeare and Milton and Zora Neale Hurston. My crafting took a temporary back seat to my studies, but my sewing machine was never far away.
There is some part of it that is personal to you, too, said Phillips, who is co-host of the Evan and Phillips show on the Mad Dog Radio channel on Sirius XM Radio. If you hired the manager and signed him to a contract or an extension, you are very aware of the fact that it will be perceived as a failure of yours that you have to fire somebody that you hired.Instead of looking at the job of the manager, people may look at the job the general manager has done.

Writing the TV series "Lost" and the sci-fi thriller "Cloverfield," Drew Goddard made a reputation as the man to see for familiar-seeming story concepts twisted into phantasmagoric new forms. Directing his first feature, "The Cabin in the Woods" (which he co-wrote with the prolific Joss Whedon), Goddard offers a uniquely warped vision of movies about scared college kids in the forest. His take on the old spook story isn't high-concept, it's in the ionosphere.

"Cobbled together" is now not only OK in Milan, it's almost mandatory. It shows the workmanship.

Jolie literalizes this theme by bringing Ajla and Danijel together again at the military camp, where he is a commander.

The 6-2, 270-pound Simon is the definition of the word powerhouse. His relentless approach is just as evident on the field as it is in the weight room. "Donald Duck could be the strength coach if John Simon were the only guy in the weight room," said Urban Meyer. According to Mickey Marotti, who has trained more than his share of Freaks in his days at Florida, Simon benched 225 38 times, timed a 4.6 40 and broad jumped more than 10 feet, but the new Buckeyes strength coach says the Freakiest thing about the defensive tackle is his weight room intensity. And, it's that which makes just as big of an impact on his teammates 365 days a year as it does on his opponents on game day.

There's learning a list of 40 words you're supposed to know on sight. There is addition and subtraction. There is listening to stories and being able to sort out the order of events.

A hotly anticipated UFC heavyweight title showdown between Junior Dos Santos and Alistair Overeem was cancelled when Overeem tested positive for an elevated testosterone to epitestosterone ratio. Questions had surrounded Overeem and performance enhancing drugs for years, due to Overeem’s massive size explosion that took place while he was fighting in an untested environment overseas. Stepping into Overeem’s place will be former champion Frank Mir, who tapped out Dos Santos’ mentor Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira in December.

The selection in Gordmans stores (Burnsville, Roseville and Woodbury, www.gordmans.com) looks similar to HomeGoods, but Gordmans one-ups HomeGoods by offering more coupons and a nice clearance section. Buyers often get a 20 percent discount coupon for a future purchase, so if you have multiple items, you might want to split them into two orders so you can apply the coupon.

I opted for the latter, which resulted in the two girls being ten minutes late to arrive for warm up. Lepeltak could have just brushed off the fact that two of his strongest players didn't abide by his rules to be on time, but he did not. Rules are meant to be applied equally to all, so Natalia and Rachel sat the bench for the first three minutes of that game, rather than starting it as they normally would. Natalia was upset because it wasn't her fault, but she respected Bill for his decision. It was an example she's never forgotten, nor have I.

At first, I couldn't find it. I knew it was at a bank building, but the bank had changed hands a couple times and I didn't know the name of the building.
