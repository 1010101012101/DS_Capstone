Yahoo hired Thompson to reverse years of financial lethargy that set in at the company even as more advertising shifted to the Internet. The funk has weighed on Yahoo's stock, which has been hovering between $10 and $20 for most of the last three years. Yahoo shares fell 27 cents to close at $15.40 on Thursday. That's well below the $33 per share that stockholders could have gotten in May 2008 if the board had accepted a takeover offer from Microsoft Corp.

Lawlor said the existing transmission grid lacked capacity to move Kansas wind power to eastern Missouri. A similar challenge faces wind farm developers in Iowa, northern Illinois and elsewhere. Even if capacity was available on existing lines, it would be difficult logistically - the equivalent of driving 500 miles on winding, two-lane country roads.
Another buyer might have balked at the deal she was offered. Lee figured she had no choice. She put $3,000 down and drove off in a 2007 Ford Fusion, agreeing to pay $387 a month for four years. The interest rate: 20.7%, nearly triple the national average for a used-car loan.

Johnson launched BET, which stands for Black Entertainment Television, in 1980. The channel started with very few shows, including a gospel music series and a video music program with a set so flimsy that the host's podium once collapsed on the air.

The cheesesteak ($7.95), made from Black Angus top round, is better than anything on the Seaside boardwalk. Period. The bread alone sets it apart from those mushy boardwalk rolls.
It does make sense to take one adult-strength aspirin, which prevents blood clots and may help keep an artery partially open. Chewing it will get it into your bloodstream quicker than swallowing it. The brand doesn't matter, as long as it's uncoated. Tylenol, Advil and other pain-relievers that aren't aspirin-based won't have the same effect.
Regular unemployment compensation lasts 26 weeks. Congress repeatedly has extended those benefits to a 79-week maximum. In states like Ohio, with exceptionally high unemployment rates, jobless recipients qualify for 20 more weeks.

The screener, John Whitfield, allegedly told the man to get to the back of the line so he and his luggage would get to the X-ray machines when Whitfield's shift started.

Being overweight or obese has long been tied to an increased risk of several types of cancer, including cancers of the colon, esophagus, kidney, pancreas and -- in postmenopausal women -- breast. But there hadn't been much evidence on the effects of diet and exercise for cancer survivors.
The force also has made costly mistakes. In 2003, officers arrested 700 people during an Iraq war demonstration, some of whom were just passers-by.

While the focus is still on the guys (Finch is living a pseudo-sophisticate lie, Oz's sex bomb of a girlfriend isn't bringing happiness into his life, etc.), American Reunion does take some effort to show how the girls are making out, so to speak. In addition to American Pie veterans Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari), there is newcomer Selena (Dania Ramirez), whom nobody paid attention to back in school, and who now fixes drinks - and transfixes the male clientele - at the local bar.

Clearly, no matter how good the price or how popular the destination, a one-off daily deal can serve only a limited market. Accordingly, I assume that dashing deals will focus on only the most popular destinations. And, at least so far, the agency does not offer you an option to ask it to notify you when a deal appears in someplace you want to visit. But if you're shopping around for a good spur-of-the-moment vacation idea, Travelocity' new offering should be on your list.

The biggest whopper in Hardin's opening statement, however, might be this: "We welcome Andy Pettitte's testimony." Hardin - who once represented Pettitte – acted unthreatened by Pettitte's expected appearance in the coming weeks, but in pretrial hearings, the Clemens team has worked feverishly to limit Pettitte's testimony. As a result, jurors may hear all about Pettitte experimenting with HGH in 2002, but not that he received the drug from McNamee.

One other big difference: Riders on this coaster can control the speed, choosing to brake through tight turns and straight stretches or letting the car fly along the tracks from top to bottom. (One negative with this self-braking system: When the rider in the car in front of yours wants to go slow, you're stuck going slow, too -- or you run the risk of ramming into him or her, a serious violation of coaster-riding rules.)

The picture gets less rosy, though, because this year's graduates are competing with those who entered the job market during the recession and in the early stages of recovery.

LeBron James attempted to show he had shaken off his poor Game 5 on the Cavs' first possession by going for a backdoor cut dunk. On film, the Cavs saw Boston had been overplaying passing lanes and they ran several of those back-door plays in the first quarter. But they were undercut by some sloppy passing and ball-handling.

According to the sources I follow, the one European purchase on which you can find a bargain is a vacation property. I've seen several reports of huge drops in property values. If you've ever wanted a cottage in some idyllic European countryside or an apartment in the middle of a sophisticated city, now might be a good time to look. But that price drop doesn't have much to do with recent changes in currency exchange rates: Instead, Europe, like the U.S., has suffered a big drop in housing prices, generally, that is likely to last quite a while.

When research began to show that trans fat was unhealthy, the Girl Scouts announced they'd have the recipes reformulated for zero trans fat per serving. That doesn't really mean "zero," by the way, because partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is still the second ingredient listed in the Samoas, for example, and can still be found in the long list of ingredients for several of the cookies.

Hey, Justin: I have not seen enough of Harangody to form an opinion. But his lack of playing time is some kind of comment on his game.

Lowdown: Three starters along the offensive line, Holmes, Bo Thran and C.E. Kaiser, left the program following their senior seasons. But just one position, center, will likely see a virtual rookie fill the role. Armstrong will enter camp atop the depth chart at center having made just one career appearance, against Portland State. He will compete with redshirt freshmen Hroniss Grasu and Hamani Stevens. The line's other projected starters, seniors Mark Asper, Darion Weems and Ramsen Golphashin, and junior Carson York have appeared in a combined 103 games, easily making Armstrong the least experienced player among the prospective starters. His task is to replace Holmes, an all-conference player, and do so in the heart of the offensive line. Armstrong was an all-state selection at guard out of McQueen High School in Reno, Nev., where he also played defensive line.

In both instances, one of the biography's great strengths is that O'Brien approaches the other artist not as a subject -- as a scholar would -- but as a character, which is what any great novelist -- as she surely is -- would do. Thus, while the poems themselves hardly make an appearance in this life of Byron, O'Brien has copiously mined his correspondence, particularly the incomparable love letters, and the diaries of his last -- and, one senses, most important -- lover, Teresa Guiccioli, the Italian countess with whom he finally found the contentment that accompanied the composition of his masterpiece, "Don Juan."

Last Saturday, Seton Hall's season came to a close on his home home court. The loss was to UMass in the second round of the NIT, not the NCAAs. The Pirates weren't the 13th team in the league, they finished 10th. And perhaps that's the most appropriate way to put Seton Hall's 2011-12 season into context: A little bit of the good, a little bit of the bad, but a lot of unexpected things along the way.

Apologies to Cleveland fans, since the Cavs have the second-best record among this group, but their schedule has just been too soft for me to read much into it.

"This is how we in many ways distinguish ourselves from the Europeans," Rockland said. "Americans, I think, still have this fantasy of just taking a road trip. The road trip is something that Europeans don’t do. First of all, gas costs 10 bucks a gallon instead of almost $4 or $3.50 or whatever. And the notion of: You take a road trip? You take a kind of road trip like you take in this country and you can go on through 12 countries."
For Auslander, part of the point is humor — just look at that name, Solomon Kugel, half biblical wisdom, half noodle pudding. But equally important is his sense of outrage, all the more profound for having no way to be reconciled. In a universe where reality itself conspires against us, he suggests, the biggest delusion is that of hope. "Pessimists … don't start wars," Solomon's analyst tells him early in the novel. "… Hitler was the most unabashed doe-eyed optimist of the last hundred years. That's why he was the biggest monster. Have you ever heard of anything as outrageously hopeful as the Final Solution? Not just that there could be a solution — to anything, mind you, while we have yet to cure the common cold — but a final one, no less! Full of hope, the Fuhrer was."

Woodward gives a grim account of the secretive visit Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) made to Islamabad and Kabul on Obama's behalf early in his term. They confronted Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari over his intelligence agency's ties to the Taliban and the impunity with which Al Qaeda operates in his country and came away without much confidence in his ability to remedy matters. Things were worse in Kabul, where there was an angry confrontation with President Hamid Karzai — who, according to U.S. intelligence, is a manic-depressive subject to wild mood swings despite medication — over his government's corruption and general ineffectuality. U.S. military briefers told Biden that "'we haven't really seen an Arab here in a couple of years.' For all practical purposes, there was no Al Qaeda (in Afghanistan). That confirmed what Biden suspected. Al Qaeda — the impetus of this war — was a Pakistani problem."

Ron Hubbard introduced the electro-psychometer, or E-meter, to aid in detecting the unhealthy and potentially damaging subconscious memories these thetans carry with them.

I am totally OK with Jack Wagner now looking like a cross between David Bowie and John Elway. Jack's excited to be with a redhead because he's been partnered with a lot of blondes. (Cough, Heather Locklear, cough?) Foxtrot to Nancy Sinatra's "Sugar Town." There's a lot of weird business at the beginning with them lying on fake grass and doing leg lifts? Anna is wearing the yellowest shoes that ever yellowed. As Tom notes, the routine appeared to have two endings. Not sure if that was intentional.

"Most independent insurance policies are age-based, which means that the older you are, the more expensive the insurance premium. For people over 60 this can be a major factor.

How long have they been in business? Are they a national or international public company? How far in advance are you paying for your trip? Do they self-insure or use a well-established insurance company to underwrite their policy?
