Inheritance (The Changeling) takes the journey into a different direction. The track is a twisting and impactful mesh of church organ, littered sonic violations, and resonating intrusive discord. The track scrapes with a salt in the wound intent whilst locking a mesmeric hold that brings it all into a testing and rewarding sinister event.

Once the dough is finished rising, divide it into however many pizzas you want and then let it rest for 30 minutes (or freeze the rest if you will not be using it all). After thirty minutes, roll your dough, put it onto a lightly oiled (olive oil) pan or pizza stone, and add toppings as desired. Bake at 500 degrees for 10-15 minutes until the edges are browned and crisped.

That's Jason Kenney bragging about how he increased immigration levels and kept them high while Canadians were losing their jobs - many of them recent immigrants - as the economy tanked; juxtaposed with a letter written by a young Canadian woman expressing her frustrations at trying to get a foothold and succeed in a discouraging job market where despite her high level of educational attainment a job as a receptionist is so far all that is available to her (and we wonder why immigrants with Phds. are driving cabs).
That song... it won't leave my brain. It started with the little Music Together class we take Naia to and this was the song she latched on to and sang and asked to hear over and over again.

It is clear that the IPCC models , on which AL Gore based his entire anti CO2 scare campaign ,have been wrongly framed. and their predictions have failed completely.This paradigm was never well founded ,but ,in recent years, the entire basis for the Climate and Temperature trends and predictions of dangerous warming in the 2007 IPCC Ar4 Summary for Policy Makers has been destroyed. First - this Summary is inconsistent with the AR4 WG1 Science section. It should be noted that the Summary was published before the WG1 report and the editors of the Summary , incredibly ,asked the authors of the Science report to make their reports conform to the Summary rather than the other way around. When this was not done the Science section was simply ignored..

Actually, I think the main reason why was a series of conversations during Saturday and Sunday afternoon that gave my phone bill another severe thrashing. The attitudes of key opinion-leaders have been gloomy for some time already, but it was the content – in terms of sheer scariness and variety – that probably gave me the colly-wobbles as I went to bed last night.

Once again, I felt that this book was just the beginning and was mostly character building for the sequels to come.
You tip your head back, loving the feeling as I savour every inch. I take my time with you, playing gently, building up to longer, deeper moves onto you. I want to treat you, tease you, lick you, taste you and want you. With a long, slow suck, I pull my bonded lips from you and work my way back up your hot body to your neck where I nibble at you, followed by soft kisses. Your hands grab my butt and massage it, I start to circle it and grind in your hands. A sensation of tempestuous desire to be joined as one with you captivates my mind.
Now, on the surface, the idea of a Coaches Registry I believe is a good one. As a matter of fact I thought that the lead organization of the sport in this country was already collecting this data on our coaches. I think that would be a tremendous aid in working towards the “30 medal goal” in major championships. Such a collection of data would be very useful in trying to match up athletes on the brink of success with coaches that possibly might be able to help them get “over the hump”. Especially in areas where we have been absent from the medal stand for some time.

And since our lives are collectively the backdrop for one big theatrical stage, Bonnie felt that as comrades in arms, now was the time for another revelation that would simply put…rock our world! It had been a minute since all four of us were able to celebrate a girls night at one of our homes. This time we had come out in all of our magnificence at Bonnie’s house for dinner, drinks and a good ole fashioned overdue gossip session. As was our custom, we dressed for the evening just as if we were embarking on an evening at an uptown restaurant. It was a code we followed to the “T” and that was that we could turn anything and/or any place into a special occasion. So, we always turned up looking fabulous in all our regal splendor!
I found another recipe online that I wanted to try so I thought I'd give it one more shot. I had also made up my mind that if this bread didn't turn out it would be a long time before I attempted it again (even though it kills me to pay so much for a loaf of bread at the grocery store!) because one can only take so much failure in the kitchen on the same item!
From sizzling gold to silver shinning the fully embroidered Elie Saab cocktail number sits like a daydream on Emma. A dress that might have looked odd on most others provides her an delicate attraction. And the indication of a absolute personality makes it more sensual. Chopard earrings add the real magic. The actress was spotted wearing a grand Bottega Veneta outfit and a stunning full skirt in flame-coloured satin. The look is styled with glossy back hair, and misty black eyes. Graceful earrings by Lorraine Schwartz go together the neckline and makes Emma Watson look just perfect.

All this is making me seriously consider banning TV outright. I know that makes me a sellout in regards to radical unschooling but I think at 2yrs old as nice as it sounds for Iris to be able to moderate her own TV appetite there are forces working against her that are making that difficult. I think TV shows these days are made to suck kids in and keep them watching for as long as possible. I'm guessing the longer they watch the more brands they begin to recognise and the more they are able to be marketed to. Ideally I would like to strike a balance and just let her watch small amounts but with Iris she seems to want all or nothing.

5. Croce di Oro (Cross of Gold)
Now, I've been accused of many things in my life, but no one has ever called me a poker face. I usually wear my stress on my sleeve, and I guess this is no exception. Today, a friend who senses that I'm in pain wrote me a quick note that said "listen to this today", with a link embedded. I clicked on the link an hour or so ago, and it turned out to be a link to a presentation I gave a couple of years ago. In September 2009, Flo Gascon gave me the opportunity to speak at the inaugural Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference in San Diego. After trying out a few topics, I decided to talk about passions - what they are, why they're important, and how critical a role they play in the future of our children. I loved writing it and loved delivering it, because it's a topic that I have a lot of passion for.

The people’s reactions to Rue and Katniss in the movie are just disgusting. If you are one of those people who think Rue isn’t black, turn to page 45 of your beloved Hunger Games book. And to say Jennifer Lawrence is too fat is hitting a new low. She looked pretty good. If you’re going to whine about how “It’s not that she’s too fat, it’s just Katniss is running around in the woods eating rabbits and that’s it!”, get into your stupid head that it’s a MOVIE, not real life. Grow up, quit embarrassing yourself, and get off of Twitter.
4. Amy Ryan, Win Win – I just like Amy Ryan. In this movie she plays a woman who may be just about the perfect mother, standing in stark contrast to her role in Gone Baby Gone a few years back. “Wife” roles traditionally aren’t the best acting showcases but Ryan shows what someone with real talent can make of one.
The loose linework, owing a greater debt to contemporary European art comics than anything published in the English language, will not be to everybody's taste, but perfectly supports the queasy tone of The House That Groaned.

Rileigh is hugely sarcastic, and though it felt like some of this was trying too hard at times, it still lent itself to plenty of laughs. This was the part of her that I could appreciate it, and while she definitely came off as weak at times, she still had a certain drive in her that helped her face down whatever was thrown at her. Her banter and interactions with her best friend, Quinten, were hilarious and fun, and Gibsen did a great job of keeping Quinten tied into the story even after the whole samurai thing really starts coming into play. Though it could be seen as Quinten having little importance, I felt like the simple fact that he was still there spoke volumes, rather than Rileigh just being too busy or unwilling to tell him the truth of what's going on.

We started off at Shoal Creek Saloon, then went to the Mean Eyed Cat and then finished at Deep Eddy. A night of slightly divey, cozy and fun bars. I love a bar (as opposed to a pub) that has a bit of a rough edge to it, but only in looks, not in clientele.

Well after all of that, Kit declines to say anything for the video. Next in line are Skip and Arch, the film's goofy comic relief characters. Arch, by the way, is portrayed by the same actor who played Biff in the Back to the Future films. Wow, so some of the cast are people who actually had movie careers. Nice. Skip is Muffy's cousin, and he seems to despise her side of the family because of their wealth. Let's keep an eye on him....Oh, and the guy behind the video camera is Chazz, a scruffy-looking slacker.
I have seen this in real life as well, men who control women and treat them like slaves, and it absolutely sickens me. Women will have a look of fear on their face; a fear that states they are afraid to make one single mistake. They fear the consequence of the mistake and fear it may be the last they make. This is what I have never understood about men, they feel the need to ‘keep their property under control.’ Come on guys, didn’t our parents teach us better than that? I know my dad did, he taught me the upmost high end respect that I mentioned earlier. That’s one thing out of many things that he taught that I love about him. He is a prime example of how men should act towards women. But men these days feel the need to be brute, tough, manly, and like they are top dog. Back in high school as playing around was fine and fun, but in real life, it is not a game. These are lives, feelings and emotions that you are playing with and destroying.
This was mildly annoying, but I didn't stay irritated for long, because I realised that at the same age I made exactly the same mistake. In the late 1960s, I bought in to a popular depiction of the women of the early twentieth century which was similarly patronising and censorious. It's only now, through reading their letters and diaries (and novels) that I have come to admire the women who lived through the two World Wars. OK, so their economic horizons were limited (Oh how my generation benefitted from exposure to schoolmistresses who these days would be running hedge funds, publishing houses or government departments) but they were no less clever, funny and diverse than us.

I can only assume that its impromptu concert had proven too demanding for its voice, because just as I reached the front of the crowd, the singing dog stopped singing, turned around, and coughed violently and with unerring accuracy directly into my face! What a way to end its canine concerto! Still in a state of shock, I was swiftly dragged away by my mother, who was convinced that I would surely develop some hideous tropical disease. Needless to say, I did nothing of the kind but, not surprisingly, the whole incident remains one of my more vivid if unusual memories of childhood!

It was day two of our freshman year in college when I complimented my shy Japanese-American roommate on the lovely, hand-woven necklace she was wearing. In response, she immediately unfastened the necklace and handed it to me with a smile. I admired it then tried to give it back but every time I reached out my hand she took a step back. “It’s yours,” she said. “Please keep it.”

The man was Chag Van Raighan. Even tiny and blurred, the elfin cast to his features was unmistakable. Trying not to lose herself in the impossibility of what she was seeing - she'd certainly never kissed him! - she reasoned out the rest of the puzzle. If Van Raighan was in the Witnessing, then it couldn't be one he'd seen himself. A Witness could Witness another Witness's Witnessing, with some loss in clarity. That might account for the fuzzy background, though if it did it was a particularly bad case.

The wife returned the children to their beds, tucked them in. I looked out the window to ensure that the house was not ablaze. This seemed like enough at the time. I turned on the television, hoping to get an update on the weather. Our oh-so-reliable Time Warner Cable...was out. It took the internet with it, as we soon discovered, when the wife tried to pull the radar up on her laptop. We called Time Warner Cable, told them what happened, and then decided it was time for bed.

This is where you make the customer feel obligated by giving them something extra. In real life the dinner invitation is a good example. Only sociopaths don't feel the need to reciprocate a pleasant dinner invitation. In fact, the rule of reciprocation is so strong that it can lead to a lifetime pattern of tit-for-tat dinners with people that you eventually come to classify as friends.

Mr. Speyer, VP-head of strategy at Wing, a Hispanic marketing agency owned by Grey Advertising, feels his experience isn’t uncommon. Mention a brand in a status update and watch it appear as a page you might “like.” Facebook enables marketers to reach huge population swaths or a segment of fewer than 50 profiles—about 0.000008% of Facebook users. All planners have to do is toggle through a list of demographic and behavioral variables and watch the pie slice get thinner.

All historians agree today that the schism which eventually became a permanent form of separation between Eastern and Western Christians did not occur suddenly. It was the result of a progressive “estrangement” (the English term used by the French theologian Yves Congar), and cannot even be dated. The churches of Rome and Constantinople were often separated for long periods of time already between the fourth and the ninth centuries. Those early conflicts were sometimes caused by heresies, held in the capital of the Eastern empire (Arianism, 335-381; Monotheletism, 533-680; Iconoclasm, 723-787; 815-842) and rightfully rejected by Rome. Sometimes Rome and Constantinople differed in their attitude in the field of eccliastical oikonomia (the “Neo-Nicean” position, inherited from the Cappadocian Fathers, 381-ca. 400; the attitude to be adopted towards the Henotikon, also referred to as the “Acacian schism”, 482-518), and communication was broken on those grounds. Whatever the issue and whoever was at fault, it is clear that, underneath the debate on a concrete theological or disciplinary problem, there was a developing difference on the repective authority of the “apostolic see” of Rome on the one side, and on the other, the idea of a conciliar consensus prevailing in the East.

Ggotseom has many high points, but where it succeeds the most is in the characterisation of its three protagonists. While we hardly learn any facts or details about them and they themselves seem to share little of their background with one another, each woman is portrayed in such a way that their suffering as well as the essence of their personality are conveyed eloquently. Rather than through dialogue, which is surprisingly limited in the film, this is achieved through the characters’ actions as well as each actress’s physical performance – their facial expressions and bodily gestures. Ju-jin, for example, has no more than a handful of lines for the entirety of Ggotseom but her empty eyes say everything we need to know about her inner torment.

No new outbreaks occurred after Jacob ordered that all drinking water be boiled. The Wheelers and the Jones rushed to catch up with the wagon train, but discovered that it had been attacked by Cheyenne warriors. All of the emigrants had been wiped out, aside from Naomi, who first became a captive and later, a wife of a Cheyenne chief Prairie Fire (Jay Tavare). The Wheelers and the Jones families were also attacked by Cheyenne warriors. They managed to repulse the attack, but Jacob ended up seriously wounded by an arrow in his chest. The surviving emigrants tried to move on with a wounded Jacob, but the juts and bumps of the trail made it impossible for him to endure the pain. Instead, he insisted that Thunder Heart Woman, Jethro, Mr. Jones and the children continue west to California without him, since he would only prevent them from crossing the Sierra Nevada Mountains before winter. They left him behind with great reluctance.

A much older Roman holiday that falls on April 25th is the Robigalia. (In a Google image-search for Robigalia, the above is what I found–and in absence of anything more certain, why the heck not use that?) Robigalia was a festival in which the sacrifice of a rust-colored dog and several sheep at the sacred grove of Robigo and/or Robigus (the former female, the latter male) in order to bring the plants to full flower and fruit, and to drive away mildew rust from infesting the crops. It’s an agricultural holiday, therefore, and one that doesn’t have an awful lot to do with folks like me–insofar, that is, as I’m not an agriculturalist or someone involved directly in such matters. However, the fact of Robigalia falling on this day was in my mind earlier, and during the last period of sleep I had, I had a dream that sort of re-oriented the holiday for me in a strange sort of way that I’m still trying to parse. The following poem is what I have written to work toward that…
I have also added in regular sweepstakes that I enter on a regular basis. They are much harder to win, but the prizes usually have much greater value than blog giveaways. They also have instant win games with a lot of sweepstakes, and those aren't as hard to win. I've won several instant win games for things such as gift cards, t-shirts, and household products. I don't win on a lot of these sweeps, but I try to not get frustrated. Because I have won several smaller ticket items, that keeps my spirits up. Just last week, I won a swag pack from Nine West which will include shoes and a shirt, and I'm not sure what else. Of course, I have to brag about my biggest win--a trip to Jamaica!! I won the trip about 2 months ago from a one-time entry on a twitter contest, and it shocked the hell out of me when they picked me! I have filled out and returned the affidavit, and still waiting on them to let me know how I actually will book my trip. It's very special to me, because my hubby and I never got to go on a honeymoon when we got married, so this will more than make up for that.

Just one more example of how sexism screws things up for everyone, I guess. If a man can only relate to a woman as a collection of disembodied parts, he’s going to have a hard time forming strong, emotionally rewarding relationships. If a woman thinks of her own body as being made up of disembodied parts, sex is going to be really weird and awkward and not very satisfying. It would really be to everyone’s advantage if people would learn to appreciate boobs in a more grown up way, as part of the whole person/experience.
This recipe was simply too good to not share with as many people as possible, so I've posted it below. The only special comment I have regarding the recipe is be sure to read the entire recipe before you begin any steps. I always fall for not doing that, and sure enough, I missed a kind-of-important beginning step, which was to be sure and cut the zucchini and then sprinkle it with salt and let it sit for about 10 minutes before broiling it. This will help zap out moisture, as zucchini is known for retaining a lot of water. Other than that, the steps are easy and it's basically the same process as making lasagna the traditional way.
When Errol Flynn’s first stab at a western, Dodge City, proved to be a financial hit Warners wasted no time in casting him in another. They reassembled as many of the cast and crew from the previous movie as possible and threw in a few more stars for good measure. The result was Virginia City (1940), and although this one wasn’t in technicolor the sweep of the narrative was every bit as epic as its predecessor. It’s not quite the movie of Dodge City but it does come close, only let down by a couple of questionable casting decisions which I’ll look at later.
I was only half right. She wasn't remotely gorgeous. She was about the size of a Jack Russel Terrier, and she looked as though she'd been swimming in the creek--which I quickly learned was exactly what she had been doing. She had floundered her way across the wide, murky creek from lands unknown; probably the farmland across from the ranch's property, from which dumped, mistreated and abandon dogs frequently wandered into camp. But this soggy little pup was desperate for some attention, and when I picked her up to stop her following after the bemused cabin of girls, something unexpected happened.

When writing this review, I discovered that this is the first in a series, and I'm quite excited about that. As I finished the last page of the book, I wondered if (and hoped) there would be more in store for Anya and the remains of her family.
A side effect of this book is being overcome with the urge to Google photos of baby tigers. I’m not sure why but who cares. They are shriekingly adorable:

My mother drove the three hours to pick my sister and I up that night. It was on that ride back home that I began to feel it—something cracking, something opening–deep, deep in my body. The next morning when we viewed his body in the basement of the funeral home, I remember one minute I was staring at his waxen, long eyelashes that used to sweep across those big, terrified eyes. I just remember those lashes, and the next thing I knew I was launched into a full-blown panic attack. That was the beginning of PTSD’s temperature starting to rise. I moved home and lived with my mother until I was well enough. I went to college to pursue writing. I made the Dean’s List. I had a baby girl named Emma Jane. I was on top of my game for several years, dedicated to psychotherapy and a guinea pig to different anti-depressants, trying to find the right one. My moods were out of whack (still not diagnosed with anything but depression and anxiety) and I was having flashbacks, but nothing that I felt was dangerous enough to mention. I wanted to be well. I had to be well. I was strong, wasn’t I? I was a fighter, wasn’t I? I fought against my abuser and my mother because of her abandonment. I was invincible. Then why this creeping sensation? Why these shadows? I think you know, or your body knows, when something is coming. Busy your life all you want, but when issues go unattended, they’ll come back.

One should not confuse the two. Thus: the physical explanation, which is a symbolization of the world by means of sensation and thought, can in itself never account for the origin of sensation and thought; rather physics must construe the world of feeling consistently as lacking feeling and aim--right up to the highest human being. And teleology is only a history of purposes and never physical!

Of course, these days, electric turbo-weasels are all the rage in the trendy nightspots around town. No celebrity (from the A-list to the Z-list*) or member of the Metropolitan-trendy elite would - these days - consider themselves properly dressed without their custom-built electric turbo-weasel prominently displayed somewhere about their person (or, if their person is unavailable, about the body of some flunkey or hanger-on, often just employed for that specific reason).
Clean your equipment well and sanitise it as you normally would. Put your chosen volume of water in a pot on the hob and then add the appropriate amount of Malt Extract, this is 10g of Malt to 100ml of water to give you an OG of around 1.030 which is good for starters. I don't boil starters as I don't think there's any need, but I will heat it up to 70c for at least 5 mins to sanitise it.

So the discussion re Masterchef teams began as Mr.7 said in response to one of the adult contestants talking of how horrible it was to be picked last. "I always get picked last for teams at school" he said. I felt AWFUL for him....those that know him well know that at this point his drooping shoulders were touching the floor. It is just too horrible to think of the awful sadness he must feel every time. I wanted to scoop him up in my arms and make it all go away and never happen again.
I should.
rolls and table look-ups can get rather tedious at times. For a successful hit there are 2 die rolls (roll to hit, roll damage) and you have to look up the hit location on a table. That's not so bad, but for a critical hit there are 3 rolls and 3 tables to consult. Add in the math necessary for figuring actual damage by subtracting the target's toughness and armor and it all gets a bit much to handle for 6 pcs and 8 beastmen late at night.
This is the most difficult part about being a pet owner. We will always outlive them.

And finally there is Terry Eagleton's The Event of Literature (Yale), "a concise, witty, and lucid book" that asks what the nature of literature actually is. I take that description from the publisher, but I inserted the serial comma as that is my nature. Eagleton's works touches on various disciplines, but he's best known as a Marxist theorist. Literary theory was the hallmark of many a college English department for many years, and if you want to read more about the passage of many an avid reader into the world of theory, you should probably read Jeffrey Eugenides's The Marriage Plot.

God created man with the perfect condition compared to other creatures. The first man, Adam, was given the understanding and knowledge of the names of objects in nature. Adam can give a name to an object, for example: the name of swans, destined to an animal that has a small head with long neck and can float and swim in the pond, and another name for the object that exists on earth.

Last year, Grameen Foundation began a three year journey, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to increase the number of active monetary savers by 1.45 million people, especially the bottom poor living under US$1.25 per day. For this project, we are working with three microfinance institutions, CARD Bank in the Philippines, CASHPOR in India, and ACSI in Ethiopia. I recently had the opportunity to visit all three MFIs over a four week period, to work with our project managers on the ground, learn more about each project, and visit clients in the field. I will be writing several posts over the next few weeks, so I wanted to introduce myself briefly, and give a bit of background on savings and our project:

These developments gave new meanings to authenticity. The American late sixties emphasis on community roots was now extended to a demand that rock was to ‘serve the people’. The roots of rock in blues were mythologised and links to the music of ‘oppressed people everywhere’ were welcomed. The search for roots sent several groups searching through the national musical inheritance mixing it with rock, often with decent results without however opening doors for a wider movement.
it was way more work than anticipated.

I thought that this was the future for me and the small company that I had started in 2004, but life had other plans for me and I wasn’t able to continue with my business. The idea never left me and I still dreamed about doing this one-day and I would continually dream up things that I wanted to do for my business.
To bring this bitch full circle, last week, the air conditioning unit was running, but no air was being moved in the house. The fan in my air handler, which blows the air around and moves the cool air into the house and pulls the hot air out, was burnt out. It needed a new motor. So, I called the same guy who had done a coolant refill for me. He changed the fan out and air was moving again.

I’m not sure how he has done in Italy however I am pretty sure that if it doesn’t work out at San Siro, Aqualani won’t come back here, at least not permanently. It’s a pity as Aqualani in our midfield would represent a much needed contrast to the increasing blandness of Downing, Adam and Henderson. I may be wrong but I get the impression that personally he wants away. Time to cut our ties and take a loss, if only to trim the wage bill? Sadly I think so.
A Military Demarcation Line within the 4-km wide Demilitarized Zone has separated North from South Korea since 1953. There are periodic incidents with North Korea in the Yellow Sea over the Northern Limit Line, which South Korea claims as a maritime boundary.

Let’s hope some day they will be responsible. Although I doubt it, because history shows otherwise. For example back in 1976 events (Thongchai Winichakul was one of the students’ leaders then) when many protesters have been slaughtered by para-military ultra-right thugs, the whole thing has also started because some Thai MSM newspapers has published some doctored photos, thus causing a very strong reaction from already too radical conservatives. Were they EVER held responsible? well, the most they did was – Bangkok Post has “apologized” for that case, and even that was done mostly because rival newspaper has raised this issue mostly for reasons to decrease their ratings as a competitors. THAT’S ALL ! Thus I doubt it very much that anyone of Thai “reporters” would ever be held accountable.
This Christmas holiday, I had three weeks of vacation from law school. When I started my Christmas vacation, I could not fathom having enough activities to keep me busy. I didn’t know what to do with myself! The first few mornings when I woke up, I kept having to tell myself, “It’s ok, there is nothing you need to be doing…just relax and enjoy!” Easier said than done. All in all, I think I did a pretty good job of just relaxing and enjoying :) When there was a lull in the excitement around my parent’s house, I seemed to resort to baking, and whipped up two cheesecakes, popcorn peanut butter balls, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, French onion soup, turkey meatballs with cranberry dipping sauce, and sautéed potatoes during my stay. Needless to say my parents aren’t looking forward to me leaving any time soon!

LITTLE NIPPER'S REVIEW
There’s no books upon your shelf
A torrential river gushing
I would often talk with our veterinarian in Kansas City about end-of-life issues for our dogs, and his philosophy was simple but mature: you are responsible to do for your dogs, who are voiceless and powerless over the diseases/illnesses they have, what offers them the best quality of life, within the limits of your resources. John taught me that when we "signed on" as pet caregivers, we took on a responsibility to do for them what they could not do for themselves, within our finite boundaries. And our goal was to help the dogs have their best quality of life. As I looked at Kodi last week, happy and wagging her tail and full of energy and vitality, it was clear that she is not "done." She has a strong quality of life still possible for some undetermined length of time. That's what I signed up for, to help her have that. It was clear that the amputation was the way to go.

It looked so good..mine didn't look as good but it sure did taste good. They are very easy and quick to make not to mention healthy. I served them with Honey Wheat Sandwich Buns. I also made a "special" sauce to go with them which was great...no need for any other condiments! I was scared Hasan wouldn't eat them. I didn't tell them there was no meat. He kept asking what was for dinner and I just said burger. He loved it and didn't miss the meat at all! But he refused to have the "special" sauce and had his with some ketchup.

Raseed is the classic pious, religious conservative who has been taught that suppressing one’s desires is key component of religious belief, which he channels into his notable battle skills. Adoulla heartily enjoys life’s pleasures such as good food and drink and has quite a sharp tongue – however, through his actions as ghul hunter and care for the wellbeing of people, Adoulla shows an equally pious belief. Other views from women and foreigners are also presented in an
The drive's about five hours. We'll see how the tiredness goes. If I'm in a mental state of decrepitude by the time I get to Hereford or thereabouts, I'll seek a cheap business-type hotel, and continue early.
Despite it's small appearance from the outside, there's actually quite a lot of space inside of the bakery and it even has some tables for folks to sit at if they plan on eating in, which was exactly what we were there to do.
You know that Daughter has 152 activities planned in hour-increments every minute of our stay there. Track days, school football, Chuck E Cheese party (help me), flag football Saturday, and I'm sure there are several other events in there before we leave Sunday morn.
Of the 28 students from Harvey that competed in the state conference in March, 14 placed first in at least one event, and five others placed second. These 19 students will compete at the national event.
This is going to be fun! You also have the stories of my impending downsizing to look forward to, as I have promised myself (on the advice of a dear friend) not to let anything, useless, broken, or bad into my new place.
Dear Dad and Ben,
Large flightless birds used as mounts or beasts of burden. These stats are for the heavier, riding crodlu. More muscular battle-trained versions have a Strength of d12+1 and a Fighting score of d8, but they're slower with a Pace of 10.
All right, Mrs. Potato Dick are still kicking it! This felt like a bit too much of a retread, as it very closely followed the template of the Crunkmas Karnival bit. How was Gross-Ass Crap for Orphans any different than Wack-Ass Junk for Immigrants? But then the hits just kept on coming, and I thought, “Okay, this one can stand on its own.” And the Ass Dan death bit was different, and clever, this time around. B+

We do need to “link up,” in the Body of Christ. Prayer is powerful. But the most dynamic power is in its unity. “If one can chase away a thousand, two can chase away ten thousand.” Of course we know the numbers don’t make sense. But in God’s universe, they do. And this is what He wants us to understand. How important this reality is.

Apparently someone in the White House thinks so, which makes the life of Julia the most interesting general-election foray by either campaign to date. Interesting, and clarifying: in a race that’s likely to be dominated by purely negative campaigning on both sides, her story is the clearest statement we’re likely to get of what Obama-era liberalism would take us “forward” toward.

At the turn of the century the main building was expanded to include a chapel, music hall, and recreation room. The school was decorated with tapestries and exquisitely-carved pieces of furniture. There were several auxiliary buildings on the grounds, including a kitchen and an eight-room brick infirmary known as “Lamar Hall.”

I must admit that I was a little nervous at the thought of attempting anything close to the peach cobbler, the first dessert of my project. Even though the final result came out good, my clumsy measuring, recipe instruction rebellion and a plastic-wrap fight to the death brought on a little beginner’s dough-making breakdown. But all things get better with time, so I was ready for round two with my rolling pin. Lace up my oven mitts and send me in the ring.
I was hanging out with my kiddo yesterday, enjoying some down time since it was raining and her softball practice was cancelled. We baked a cake, watched a little TV, nothing much.
‘Write about what you know’ is a bit limiting. So do the research. You want to write about teenagers in a modern school… do you really know how they talk and behave, or are you relying on personal memories of school, long out of date? You want to set a book in America, but you’re not American… your two-week holiday in Maine or Miami is not going to cut it, no matter how many times you’ve watched the reruns of Friends. I don’t wish to sound like Donald Rumsfeld, but there is stuff you don’t know, that you don’t even know you don’t know. I read a fantastic book recently, a sci-fi time-travel novel set partly in Tudor England. The author had done masses of research into the period, most of which really paid off. But she was Californian, and so she put a full-grown, fruit-bearing orange tree into an English orchard, which bumped me right out of the story for a few pages. Her ‘normal’ was not my ‘normal’; but she didn’t know. I still loved the book, but it would have been better without the orange tree.

I'm not very good at keeping up with BOMs. Not good at all. I started Barbara Brackman's Civil War blocks....love, love, love them....but only did four. Life got in the way. But I printed all the patterns and someday I'm going to make that quilt.
We all enjoyed this cake as it was lovely and light and it was nice to have something plain for a change. Perhaps it could have done with a few drops of vanilla extract to give it a bit more flavour. This cake could easily be dressed up for a children’s party with some simple butter cream and sweeties!

I added the little welcome greeting to the door also but I feel like my other door looks naked now. So my question to you is what should I do, leave it plan or add something to the other door. My daughter thinks I should add something like, "to our home" I just am not sure, what do you think? Use your Em-agination and come up with another saying to help me out.
‘performance’ was spoken word, so it’s a bit of a surprise that this was also not a minor hit: mind you, although his hit was also awful, it’s nowhere near as toe-curlingly bad as this horror, and he did have the major-label might of Pye behind him, rather than the tiny independent Monarch company – a label which specialised in pipe band and country dance music but who also released ‘comedy’ records by Scot's wifeswapping children's entertainers The Krankies and 70s camp stereotype Larry Grayson - with their miniscule promotional muscle.
His own picture was among the grouping. There were few pictures of Meg, which made sense. DJ wouldn’t want to decorate with pictures of himself, either. He shifted through the small rooms. The spare bedroom held a computer on a desk covered with stacks of ... stuff. Papers, books, a coffee cup. DJ was certain it made sense to Meg. On the top shelf was another picture of himself. Taken in Afghanistan, DJ recognized the building behind him. He’d been hot and covered in grit, if DJ recalled correctly. Sunglasses perched on top of his head glinted in the sunlight. He’d received a commendation and had been willing to smile for the camera. He’d sent the picture to his mother as a ‘proof of life’ gesture. Apparently, his mother had shared. A bookshelf held too many books for the shelf and there was no order of stacking. Softball trophies stood in rank on the very top. Various ribbons hung from the bats and around the necks of the little gold ball players. He’d missed those days, DJ realized. Swallowing the surge of emotions and the second-guessing, DJ moved to the bedroom. He ignored the cat sitting in the small hallway. He gave a glance into the bathroom and found the rubber ducky shower curtain to be amusing. Not as amusing as the collection pf actual rubber duckies lined up at the top of the shower wall.
Usually foreign nationals who are the most in need of competent legal advice – those living illegally in the U.S. or who have been arrested and face deportation – are the ones most likely to fall prey to the false promises of a green card from these scam artists.
Add the butter and sugar to a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to cream them until smooth and light. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue whisking until the batter is smooth and the sugar starts to dissolve, about 30 seconds. Add the vanilla and salt and whisk to incorporate. Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and baking powder over the batter then add all of the coffee. Gently whisk the batter until it is smooth and most of the lumps are gone.
I only added a couple of England because… it was just…O.K. Scotland was my favorite. It was my favourite before I had even gone there, and it met and exceeded all expectations. And then there is Cuba. Have I mentioned I love film? Especially vintage.
They are a a pair of headphone sets that connect under one 3.5mm headphone jack. So the idea is that you can plug into your mp3 player, or really anything with a 3.5mm audio-output jack and listen along with a friend. The sound quality on them isn’t amazing or anything, but they solve a problem.

Yesterday I explored a Spanish cemetery. As with most things, they do this also a little differently here. Since cremation is not widely practiced here, they have had to build up to make room for all the coffins. The coffin is inserted into a niche, and these niches can be rented for a pre-determined number of years.

Josiah, my son, was loud and strong from the beginning, but at the time I didn't care. I had very little interest in him. I just wanted to go to sleep. I can remembered feeling exposed as she stitched me up. The tugging and pulling I felt as she did it made me sick to my stomach. I remember feeling like nothing but a piece of meat. When she was finished, I mumbled something like everyone has seem him, you can go home now. I am not even sure anyone heard me, but after that everything was a blur. I don't remember what my ex-husband said or when he left. Or his mother, who was there, or my friend. I don't remember transferring rooms. I don't remember how. I just remember being in the bed and having my my uterus pushed on and my pad checked. It hurt like hell and was again humiliating having someone pulling at your underwear to check your pad. I asked if I could do it, and the nurse said something like I heard you were trouble. I shut up and let her do it. She was so smug and her touch was rough. I felt scared and alone and wished they allowed husbands to stay overnight. Round four over.

So now the final part of the holiday to get through is New Year. I am lucky in the sense that Kates hates New Year just as much as I do. All the pressure to go out and have fun, screw that. I’m not paying the best part of £40 to go somewhere that would normally cost me nothing on any other day. We always have an anti New Years Eve by having a nice meal in a restaurant in the early evening, take a stroll around London, and then go home to glare at people out of our window.

Usually I eat healthy things now, whole foods and fresh veggies and such. These is not much processed food around the house anymore really. And I do know typically the number of calories I consume in a day. Normally if I just wanted to stay as is without doing much work I would be eating about 2000-2200 calories a day. But because of all the things I do, and the muscle mass I have just to maintain what I have I have to eat about 2800-3000 or so.
One florescent light, its cover open, bounced with the movement of the car. She watched the cover swing backward and forward as the train moved along turning sharply first left, then right. As the cover swung in front of the light, it caused a strange plastic flicker. So smooth was the train’s movement, the yellow flicker of light was the only sign that they were speeding along underground at 30 miles per hour. There was a mass grave of dead flies stuck in the corner of the light. It struck her as curious. They were not underground insects; how did they come to die here?

But the real damage was done less publicly. South Africa had followed the British university model in which the crucial academic body was the university senate, composed of all the professors. What this guaranteed was that in day-to-day governance universities were run as a republic of the scholars. This was, in the last analysis, the best guarantee of academic freedom and academic standards.
And that might leave a mark.
The last three shows where our singer ended each set early (replete with self-disparaging, self-fulfilling comments throughout), an upcoming show nobody was asked about until after it had been booked, and now an unforeseen family vacation. I'm washing my hands. Flanked by musicians who seem to actively work against our interests while trying to keep my sanity and convince promoters and venues that we're reliable is a bigger battle than I can fight alone, so I'm not going to try.

Still a very visually pleasing series that looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray just as it does on DVD; the series captures the endearing artwork of the manga and that is a very good thing. If you have the means, this series deserves to be seen on an HD setup.
We finished off our wine, had a few laughs and headed around the corner to the club. When we arrived the tension with our male friends was palpable, almost to the point of hilarious. Rayanne and I had brought dates to the club before, but never as a team and this seemed to upset the pack order somehow. Nothing was ever said out loud, but the guy comedians were starting to act weird. My date went to the bathroom and Niko stepped up to me, “That’s what you consider a date?” he said. “The guy’s a toothpick. I didn’t know you liked pipe-cleaner-dudes.”

It's not going to be back with us until at least the 20th January - which feels like a very long time away. But at least once it's fixed we won't have to keep the screen at a certain angle to keep the picture on, listen to the noise of the fan trying to take off and have a full set of keys on the keyboard. It should have gone into be repaired ages ago - but it was almost useable so we've not bothered.

The course goes up a long incline from that corner and even though I've run it plenty of times before, I'd never run it after running 6+ miles. It was rough. I distracted myself by eating my Shot Bloks and I was thankful for the water station at the top where I slowed down to drink some water. I'd been worried that the water stations would be too far apart but they were perfectly spaced.

This weekend I blew out my knee playing with my kids; don't know all the details yet, but it's probably one of those surgery things. Anyway, sitting in a chair, feeling sorry for myself, provided the perfect opportunity/excuse to crack open a bottle of Founder's Devil Dancer Triple IPA. This beer weighs in at a whopping 13% alcohol by volume and it is simply incredible. If someone hasn’t tried homebrewing they have no idea how hard it is to do a 13% alcohol beer that is that perfect and clean, with nothing poking out. Big beers like that are very hard to pull off, with a lot of technical challenges. This one was smooth and pristine, even as it warmed to room temperature which is where flaws really begin to show. It is not at all complex—my guess is that the grain bill is very simple and that Founder's utilized a California Ale yeast strain which ferments very clean. Distinctively sweet, but not cloyingly so, with a perfect high hop level to balance that sweetness—Devil Dancer has a thick mouthfeel and a distinct alcohol presence that is warming but never harsh. Absolutely incredible and by all means one of the best barley wines (or triple IPA, if you want to go with the new-fangled nomenclature) I have ever had. Highly recommended if you can get it locally (which, alas, I cannot—I won this bottle in a bet.) I do not recommend tearing up your knee just to have an excuse, but if you do then this beer certainly represents a significant consulation.
In the meanwhile I may just have to start a collection of those pretty green bottles as I continue on my quest to become a beer connoisseur.

We then visited the Chateau in Usse which inspired the writer of "Sleeping Beauty." It is gorgeous from the outside, but it is decorated with a plethora of mannequins and wax figures illustrating French life as well as the story of Sleeping Beauty. AND, the mannequins are dressed in costumes reflective of the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries with a little 1970s thrown in for good measure. Super freaky and totally confusing. The above picture is from the "Tasting in the Wine Caves." I decided to join the mannequins.

Subcomandate Marcos has become a wildly popular figurehead for the indigenous peoples of rural Mexico, whose message has resounded broadly throughout the world with all peoples that feel they are being exploited and unheard by their governments. The sentiments of the Zapatista are not that dissimilar from the movements of the "Arab Spring" or Occupy Wall Street, or even the Tea Party. The message is apolitical, but it's implications could and should be at least a wakeup call for corrupt politicans around the world, if not a call to movement for the rest of us.

Once upon a time, me and my then-fiance worked in a really great restaurant. He waited tables and I hosted. I mean it when I say we adored working there. It was one of my favorite jobs I’ve ever had. One of the reasons we loved working there were the people we worked with. We were very good friends with one of the managers – the young one who was in charge of scheduling. He was a newlywed himself, and he had honeymooned at the exact resort we had booked. I had already had my surgery for endo and was doing much better, but still had to take days off occasionally for pain. Since the schedule manager was such a good friend, I thought I could share with him my true reasons for taking off work, rather than having my fiance just tell them I had a cold or something.

To be perfectly honest, this demo completely snuck up on me. It could have been because my interest level in this title is lukewarm at best. It also doesn’t help that it’s releasing very close to a couple of high profile games in the month of May either. Still, I can’t resist the call of a free demo, so after it finished downloading, I dove in. After playing through the demo, I can honestly say that my thoughts on Dragon’s Dogma haven’t really changed much. Still the game is trying to do some interesting things so lets take a closer look.
Oh how I love this family. I could go into all the reason I love them and what they mean to us, but just suffice it to say - they are dear to us.

Jacie Tripplethree appears to be the perfect woman. She's a beautiful actress with an uncanny sense of humor and perfect comedic timing. No wonder Adam, an aspiring television writer, wants to build a series around her. The problem? She's an actoid - a robot designed specifically for acting - and the studio believes that her unprogrammed sense of humor is a defect that needs to be removed. While Adam fights to preserve Jacie's consciousness, he finds himself beginning to fall in love with the charming robot. Will Adam get the green light on his series? Will robot love prevail? Will Jacie win her fight for actoid rights?
Now I need to know..... I know if you break a mirror it's 7 years bad luck! I didn't hang the mirror, nor did I drop the mirror, so does that mean that I don't get those 7 years of bad luck? Do you actually have to break the mirror yourself to get the 7 years bad luck? If superstition is correct and I get the bad luck, with the size of that mirror, its going to be a massive 7 years, LOL.

This morning I've woken to a much cooler day with a dull grey sky and rain falling gently outside - bliss! Yesterday, as Grace played happily in our backyard while Sophie had her morning nap, I sat on our patio, Yates Garden Guide in hand, planning some things to do in our garden once it cools down more. With the recent extreme heat Perth has had lately, there have been a few casualties around our place and I haven't had a very good record with our pot plants which seem to dry out very quickly.

Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN has made reference to the ills of this kind of economy, in one of his recent sermons. Of course, he had spoken to diverse media establishments, before now, on the vision of blood flowing on the streets; blood which should not be flowing for any reason whatever. He had told the world that hatred, jealousy, political mischief and political miscalculations would most often, lead to bloodshed. Blood is being shed, till now, by the militants in the Niger Delta, and the Boko Haram sect in the north. Such situations have also occurred in Ivory Coast, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia. There are threats of Boko Haram’s likely invasion of Mali, too. Blood is flowing because of “struggles for power”, even when those who eventually secure power are not likely to invest progressively in human and mineral resources.
We plan on using recycled paper for the save-the-date cards, wedding invitations, and place cards. We also want to print a list of ways that our guests can help the environment on the back of the place cards. I'm still searching for a place that we can get organically-farmed cut flowers or flowers that were grown without using any pesticides. For wedding favors we plan on giving out seeds that represent seeds of love where our guests can plant their own plant or tree. Recently I've been researching where I can purchase a wedding gown made of organic materials because I'd really like to wear a dress made of something completely eco-friendly. Lastly, we plan on creating a registry filled with eco-friendly items such as organic cotton sheets, recycled glass vases, and bamboo dishes.
The largest Tyrannosauras rex ever found is 42 feet long. So this dragon is longer than a full-grown T. rex. Picture the head: how do you put a couple of teeth into Beowulf's neck and not--even by accident--just gobble him up? The teeth are the size of bananas: if they are touching his neck, his head is coming off.

I got a call at 3 AM from my mom saying that Gram was being taken to the hospital. Dad had already left and she didn't have her truck, so she asked if I could take her. Of course. I got up as fast as I could, and made the drive to my mom's house. On the way, I called my sister because I knew she was spending the night over there, baking with Gram. Her voice, and what she told me made my heart sank. "It's not good ." What does that mean? I could not comprehend the situation and it was all I could do to not speed on the way to the hospital. She told me in detail what had transpired in the past 2 hours, and I was further confused.

I guess it shows that when there's a voice telling you that an element of your novel doesn't work, it's important to listen to that voice, rather than sticking your fingers in your ears and saying 'lalalalala can't hear you' which is what I've been doing for the last few months!
Yes, I still long for the world that once was; the innocence, simplicity and luxury of naivety that we once lived, but that world is gone forever. We live in a new world now. We've found a 'new normal', and for all of the negatives that we have come through, it's not without positives. We love deeper, cherish stronger, prioritize better, and appreciate everyday together more sincerely than we ever have before.
Once again it has been a busy and yet productive weekend, Andy and Jordi attended an executive meeting for the UCU on Saturday and gave some up dates with the campaign followed by some much appreciated applause. The members did a whip around seeing us raise a nice little donation for campaign materials; it is always nice to see committed individuals.
My final three days in Nepal (for the time being at least) were taken up by a bandh. As well as reinforcing the points in my last post this did show up some of the best sides of Nepal.

After a tumultuous past, Greta Kendall has focused mainly on her bridal shop, located on the first floor of her beloved Queen Anne Victorian near Aspen. For two years she's fought to save her house from Stephanie Harwood of Harwood Development, who is intent on razing her home to build a new mall. But now Greta's running out of time. The town council is about to approve the final plans for the mall.
I'm Sharon Carol Sta. Maria Lamb. Spontaneous. Crazy. Blogger. Nature Lover. Computer Baby. Graphic Designer wannabe. Frustrated Programmer. Twitter Spammer. Tumblrista. Creative Bum. Dreamer. Funny. Netizen. Owl. Panda Baby. Polar Bear. Facebook Stalker. Music Lover. Adventure Seeker. Eiffel Tower lover. Coffee Slave. Certified Day Dreamer. Furry creatures aficionado. Happy-go-Lucky. Hopeless Romantic. Current job: Customer Account Executive -- in short, dakilang call center agent ng bayang Pilipinas. This is where my thoughts linger and my emotions chill. Sometimes words and thoughts really need some place to stay in order to preserve the great memories of the present. I guess my emotions just need to be documented in order for me to fully appreciate my life... in its deeper sense. Who am I is such a cliche in my world. I consider myself as a complete stranger to my friends, a hopeless romantic who never tells what her heart longs for and a frustrated self proclaimed artist who is stuck in her nutshell waiting for her moment to arrive. My dream job is to be a wedding planner... seeing fairytales come to life equates to bliss. How I wish I can make lovers dreams come true. I finally let go of my fantasies of being a lawyer... I guess I don't want to make my life complicated. You see I'm just a regular kid who loves adventure and freedom. But I'm not a regular girl... I'm a bit too conservative to some but hell I'm crazy. Some people think I'm stupid, some think I'm smart and that's because I can outwit people most of the time but nah - I'm just a bit aware of everything around me. I don't call it intelligence, I define it as common sense. I live between two extremes.

It was clear to the north of the summit and fog was blowing in from the south. The view to the north was spectacular and the whole Olympic range was visible. While I ate lunch, the chipmunks and a mountain goat patrolled around looking for handouts.
But of course! We needed support! Support from a group was the missing ingredient; it might even override the fear….the fear that still says that I don’t fit in anywhere.
Then suddenly they will see what they have rejected and fought against and there will be great weeping and gnashing. Yet even now it is not too late to turn. The Lord cries out, behold He stands at the door and knocks. He will yet be found by those who seek Him in the day-time, but the darkness approaches. Seek Him now while it is yet light, for he who inhabits the darkness approaches with great fury and will destroy without mercy……. bro Frank
Today’s appointment was a, “I don’t know what to talk about, you choose a topic,” I was of course avoiding the subject of weight and we kicked off the conversation about me not being there last week and discussed the toothache and dentist appointment and of course Mr Therapist is aware of my dislike for the dentist! I also knew there was a topic to talk about… and at the back of my mind, somehow somewhere I plunged right into talking about it, as openly as I would do with E.
The first complaint came from a woman who said she felt mistreated after she disclosed to a screener that she was carrying breast milk. A man who is Sikh filed the second complaint, saying he was subjected to extra security even though he had not set off any alarms. The woman’s complaint was based on gender and the man’s, religion, said coalition program director Amardeep Singh.
As I ha said yesterday was a good but busy day. It started out as a normal Saturday with my going out to eat with Meta. Lunch was light but good. Then we went home and I dicked around for a while. After a few hours and some “bickering” over what to have for food we went to several places to pick up supplies because we noticed that we had very little to cook but stir-fry…lol

I was actually surprised at the vividness of it all. The smell, the feel, the hurt, all resurfacing. And while I’m sure most of you know that I don’t leave a wealth of comments (I’m working on it, I’m working on it…) I did feel compelled to drop Jeremiah a line, stating “You touched a nerve today. I remember too well staring into that glass. Hoping to see some kind of light, but only hating the pitiful face that stared back at me instead.” And even now, as I proof-read this last line, my eyes begin to well. Oh, how I wish I could hug that kid. How I wish I could tell him that everything was OK. That it wasn’t he who was all fucked up, but rather the world around him. How I wish I could tell that kid that being shy isn’t a disease, it’s not a retardation, it’s just how some people are. How I wish I could tell that kid to stop hating his reflection, to stop hating himself. How I wish I could tell that kid – well – tell him that he was loved. That he is loved. That he knew it, had he only paid attention.

By any meaningful measure, then, our president has followed the least-successful economic policies of any U.S. leader since World War II. As recession seems ever more possible, the IMF warns of a U.S. “lost decade.”

I love reading Dumas because it’s fun and swashbuckling and wild—I can imagine him being totally down with the new The Three Musketeers film adaptation, which already looks absolutely out-of-control. He takes swipes at all quarters, including his own characters; D’Artagnan can’t help making fun of Porthos’ reliance on his brawn over his brains at one point, which goes over his friend’s head. And it all comes wrapped up with a neatly bittersweet ending, which I love. Yes, his works can be intimidating on the basis of sheer size, but I like to encourage people to give them a shot. You just have to remember to take it in small doses—just like Dumas’ original audience—and hang in there. They’re completely worth it.
Wow, it's been a week and a half and I am quite glad to have a whole day where I have nothing planned and nothing specific to do (aside from the usual house stuff that is!) You see, a few months ago, I decided that I was in danger of digging my rut deeper and deeper and not doing anything to climb out of it; and so I began to find other things to do, not to mention people to meet!

I know a LOT about knitting and crochet. I’m beginning to learn more about spinning. I am happy for these three subjects to be my primary areas of research and learning. For the rest of my interests, I’m happy to enjoy them without knowing too much. I can sew a few pieces of material together and thereby I quilt; I can put one foot in front of the other slightly faster than I may walk and thereby I run. I don’t really want to wonder or worry too much more about it and I don’t need too until… I need to!

Originally the room was going to be Coral and Navy and Gold. That is it. Nothing else. I was struggling a little trying find fabric that matched the Coral Mirrored Dresser (Krylon Coral Isle).

Yes I know, too keen, we did beat the worst of it but oh my Moniave to Dalry with a very strong headwind, painful! The bacon butties in New Galloway were very welcome indeed. What a place to cycle in though, we are so lucky living here, it's an amazing area.

On November 9, 1868, the Colorado, a large Pacific Mail steamship carrying hundreds of passengers and the US mail, ran aground on the unseen shoals off Point Montara. Although the ship eventually floated free and all the passengers--and the mail--survived, the near-disaster left its mark on public sentiment.

Speed did not equate to comfort. Roads were rough and the coaches ran in all weathers, making travel unpleasant, especially for those riding outside. Passengers often had to disembark to lighten the load when the vehicle went up a steep hill. On the plus side, mail coach travel was safer than on private stagecoaches. The guard defended the mail with a blunderbuss and two pistols. As a result, mail coaches suffered fewer highwaymen attacks than private stagecoaches, although some did occur.

I have to admit, the first third of the film wasn't capturing my attention and I nearly quit watching it. I am so glad that I hung in there because the rest of it was to interesting and inspiring! If you haven't see it, you've got to!
Then last night after I got home from a really fun "31 party" I thought it was really getting chilly in the house. That's because our furnace went out! Good news, we have electric heaters on in every room...temp in house 79 degrees! Help me I'm about to sit around in a swim suit! It's hotter in here now then when we run the furnace!!! We're scheduled for repair service! Woo Hoo! :0)

It doesn’t take a genius, however, to see that Hitler strays into suspect territory in the second half of the passage above when he talks explicitly about nationalism and, of course, ‘the mission of the Aryan man’. This should not be that odd to contemporary leftists in the sense that, say, SWP Leftism is itself worlds apart not from Nazism, but other versions of communism, such as Stalinism, Maoism, and even the more acceptable (to the SWP) versions such as Trotsky’s original position, or Che Guevara-ism, or Castroism.
I got further confused as to where we were to get off this time. We were on the C line and had to get off at Av de Mayo, I thought we had to change to the A line to get off at Lima, but all we had to do was walk underground to Lima station.Limabeing the same station as Av de Mayo. Viv wanted to head straight for the salida, but I insisted we head for the A line. Once there I knew where we would come out of the ground and we would be only one block from our final destination.
The scenes of Caravaggio at work are crisply edited, built around exchanges of glances: Caravaggio works in this film by arranging tableaux of living models who perfectly hold the poses of his paintings while he stares at them. The painter spends more time looking, observing, than he does actually putting brush to canvas — so much so that in one scene, after Caravaggio has spent seemingly endless minutes looking at the scene he's arranged, Del Monte bursts out laughing when the painter finally, tentatively, touches his brush to the painting to adjust a minor detail. Jarman, one of the most visual of filmmakers, clearly possesses this same painterly sensibility: the instinct to look, to stare intently, to soak up every detail of a scene before finally attempting to capture its essence. In the scenes of Caravaggio painting, Jarman cuts methodically between the painter and the models, who sometimes meet his gaze, sometimes look away as dictated by their pose. Implicit in this exchange of looks is also the painter's eroticizing of his subjects, a homoerotic desire that shows through even in paintings where Caravaggio has transformed a worldly young man into a pouty, cherubic angel or warrior saint. Jarman aligns himself with the painter in this by populating his film with pretty young men who are as much subjects of the filmmaker's appreciative gaze as they are of the painter's brush: it is one more way in which Jarman seems to be telling his own story as much as Caravaggio's.

Someone googled “How do you determine the conflict in a story” and ended up at my blog. Although I have written about conflict before, I had not addressed that particular issue; I wasn’t even sure I could come up with a simple answer if I had to. Then I realized that to determine the conflict, first we have to know what conflict is. In a story, conflict is desire meeting resistance.

God is sovereign. Whatever season of life – sugar high happiness, normal try-to-get-up-in-time-for-class days, or those days when you just want to lie in bed and cry your heart out – there is a reason. God doesn’t change. He was, is, and will always be who He is – unchangeable, perfect, holy, loving. So don’t ever, ever doubt His existence or love for you in times of trial! Remember what was sacrificed for your life in heaven – He humbled himself in obedience, to the point of death on a cross. He died as a human, the almighty holy God, and died a death that the lowest criminal, the scum of the earth deserved – a painful, humiliating death as the people who celebrated as he entered Jerusalem and showered him with love cursed his name and spit in his face. The full wrath of God, separation from Him, our guilt, our shame. The perfect and innocent Jesus, did that for us, out of love. Don’t ever doubt His love for you.
Case in point? I penned this post along with about four others in an evening last week. I write, edit, schedule in rapid-fire sequence. Then I do a final proof and tweak before they go live.

To list under my aching breath the things I have this very moment and am blessed to be steward of and the ways I am okay this very moment.

Recently there has been a lot of noise about the Tiobe index in which search engine result counts are compared for various programming languages. Looking at search engine results is an approximate, but very inaccurate method of measuring popularity. One problem with such a method is that the mere mention of a programming language on any web page (regardless of context) is interpreted as “popularity”. There is no notion of how old a web page is. If C++ gets mentioned in a blog post from 1997 that’s counted towards current “popularity” even if the author of the blog post no longer uses C++. Search results including “I hate XYX programming” and “XYZ programming sucks” get counted as “popularity”.
Paris plus rain, plus a night sky, plus lights, equals one of my favorite things. Rather than duck for cover, hit a museum or otherwise camp out inside, I embrace the rain, open the umbrella and enjoy the show. What show? Light dancing on the glowing pavement, moody people tucked under umbrellas and into trench coats, the juxtaposition of warm, glowing interiors and the dark, wet cold. I'll eventually tire of the rain, and will choose a café in which to warm up and enjoy a café creme, but not before I enjoy every sight and sound.
LC: The top four are a less surprising mix, though I would not necessarily have guessed that Poseidon would be up there. He was beastly to Odysseus because of Troy, but really, it wasn’t just Odysseus who brought about its downfall. I’ve always thought that Poseidon was over harsh in that particular case. I am also scared of the sea—I don’t want to go out further than I can touch—so he was never going to be my favourite.

After cooking a corn dog for Bronson he was sitting at the table eating his lunch. I went downstairs to talk to Randy in his office. When I came upstairs I yelled, "Bronson!" when my nose caught a whiff of something burning. There in the microwave was a second corn dog with 9 minutes remaining. Not sure how long it was in there, but it was plenty done!! And he didn't even want to eat it. Can you imagine??

The problem with Ringer from day one has been its employment of increasing degrees of insane complexity not as a way of driving plot forward, but of obscuring the fact that the plot isn’t going anywhere. For a show that sets up a “sisters at odds” premise in its first episode to not have them come face-to-face in the ensuing season is nothing but narrative wheel-spinning, and has left all the actors involved with the unenviable task of explaining away their constant heel face turns depending on the necessities of that week’s craziness. Andrew Martin goes from doting husband to possible killer depending on Bridget’s suspicions, his daughter is either an innocent product of a broken home or a manipulative rape-crying mastermind, and Siobhan’s lover Henry starts off as a bravado junkie in a turtle neck before descending into a murderous arch villian (in a turtle neck). It’s all too much, and yet not enough – like straining your eyes at a photo for an hour before realising that the picture itself is blurry, not your vision.
The hop collection was rationalised: varieties that could be obtained elsewhere, duplicates (plants that had different names but where identical in character and genetics to other varieties) and hops that had been superseded were removed.

Brewer and his party stayed at the 21-Mile House three times, each time camping out rather than staying inside the tavern. Brewer's entry for a blistering May evening in 1864 reads:
There may have been several battles along the way but this is the big one, the one that counts. Theseus finally lands in Crete and descends into the labyrinth to fight the minotaur and win the prize of his people’s lives. Often the hero first comes face to face with death and his own mortality. It is at this point that the hero realises their true identity, often as a leader. Mattie must face the man who killed her father, Ned Chaney. Rango must face the Mayor, the worst of several baddies. P.K. must face Whittlin’ Walt, the most notorious desperado in Nevada Territory.
The important thing is the direction the Mets are finally headed in. The question is are they committed to this total youth movement? Time, the rest of this season and the upcoming winter will go a long way towards answering that. We shall see. My hope is they realize this is the right thing to do; rebuild it from the ground up.

The beer was pretty awesome, though. We ran into William Reed right away, and he insisted on getting us two cups of Vienna Lager (great, malty but not thick, wish they'd make more of this). I tried to return the favor with the superlative and much-welcome Charles Bridge Pilsner, but he'd wandered off into the crowd and I gave it to Richard "Victory" Ruch. The Maibock (destined to be named DAX after the winner, shown here in the center of a long shot on his victory strut) was gorgeous, beautifully drinkable, and if I hadn't been at the edge of silly at that point, I'd have had another. I did get one sip of one of the eisbocks, and it was scary good.

Jesus had the glory and still has it, but now the people have to get to know it. And glory has to be brought unto him now (at that time) on earth. Without God showing the people that Jesus has the glory by his Father, people would not know it and would have it difficult to accept him, Jesus, as the promised one spoken of by many prophets before Roman times.

The crazed cultists were not quite as visible back in those days, but even then they issued death threats. I got one myself, and I cherish it as a badge of honor to this day. When the government of Iran upped their bounty on Rushdie (issued in conjunction with Khomeini's fatwa, because apparently Good Muslims need millions of dollars to contemplate committing murder), I wrote a column for a paper on the topic that was similar in tone to the Mad Muslim posts you find around here. A Good Muslim wrote in that she had seen me crossing the street the day the column ran and that she had thought about running me over with her car for insulting the Holy Men of Islam and the Good Muslims who heed their words. An apology was demanded by her and many other letter writers. None was given, except in a very sarcastic follow-up column.

What confused me even more, is that fact that during my 10 week internship, counselors asked me daily if I was hired yet. My internship supervisor was the one that pointed out this job, stating I would be fantastic at it. Furthurmore, I've never, ever, even gotten so much as a talking to in previous jobs. Typically, I'm commended as one the best, hardest working employees they have. In graduate school, I've maintained a 4.0 GPA while working full-time night shifts. It seemed odd to me that within 1 1/2 weeks of being hired (at the same place I've been interning at) that all of a sudden I would let all of my professionalism, appropriateness and work ethic go completely out the window.

I love how it turned out, although when I look at it at times, I can't help but think it still needs something, although I don't know what. I used my favorite medium, my trusty Tombow watercolor color markers. Then I added some Sakura glitter jelly roll pen over some spots to highlight it a little bit. Although I don't think you can see it in the picture, it really adds to the image in a way I can't explain.

And all this rhetoric that JW and imaginary friend present, about us birth siblings, sounds like it came straight out the Middle Ages when the only religion that was allowed was the Roman Catholic Church and all other belief systems were subjected to any matter of bogeyman traits. What next Joan, are you going to have us put on the ‘rack’? Nice going here, Joan, I’m sure you are making more friends and converts to your illogical thinking with your continued attacks upon your birthsiblings and our religious beliefs…you are SO good at that, you have been condemning our religions for decades. You MUST have the pulse of the planet at your fingertips to be so all wise and knowing about what is or isn’t! Dream on!

It’s your 3 year anniversary and you come home for a wonderful night with your lady- instead you see your clothes packed by the door. You are wondering, what did I do now? She comes out- arms crossed- saying “I’m sick of being your girlfriend, it’s been 3 years today and I’m not doing it anymore!” You -still in shock- wonder what’s wrong with her? Everything is going great between you two, why mess it up with all the complications and the legal stuff?

For me, the weather-watch begins in earnest a couple days prior to departing. A quick dash over to the National Weather Service site told me that we were in for some unsettled weather in store for our trip – exactly what I wanted to hear as unsettled weather adds drama and excitement to most scenes. There are a plethora of sites offering forecasts, but I go right to the main source and the most experienced meteorologists in the business for my forecast. Partly cloudy skies and a chance of a thunderstorm was in the forecast for the Grand Canyon. Though we did get some nice clouds, I never did hear the crack of thunder. I try not to get overly excited as many forecasts never actually pan out, but I also never venture out without checking. I routinely will change planned location shoots to try and optimize the best light I can find for my participants. In Page, I actually had to eliminate a planned shoot at one location because the forecast called for an 80% chance of thunderstorms. The road was not paved and the area we had planned to photograph was a wash area during flash floods, so I did not feel it met with my safety expectations given the latest weather information. As it turned out, the rain never materialized, at least in Page, but we had no idea what was happening in the surrounding mountains and that is where the flash floods begin. I decided to take the group back to Horseshoe Bend where we had photographed sunset the day before and we were treated to entirely different light from a gorgeous sunrise!

Seems my power problems for years should have been looked at a long time ago. My battery pack had been overheating since around the time we bought the laptop, resulting in the connection sockets sparking out (yeah, I’d turned a blind eye to the occasional orange light I witnessed, just thinking it was a pretty colour and all) and the whole thing melting around the power cord. Now it’s got new parts, and this morning is the first time I’ve opened up my computer without being afraid to breath and accidentally jiggle the power out of it.

Complaints, though expected can have an impact to the relationships. It brings more stress to the one who is caught in the middle of both parties who are having conflicting interests. Come to think of it the common reason that brought them all together in one place is love. The kids were the product of love, if they are being possessive and jealous of their parents, that is because they love them and they are afraid that they might lose them to that someone new. On the other hand, the new someone has his/her share of complaints and demands because he/she is in love and wants to have a wonderful and lasting relationship with the parent of the kids, the mere fact that he/she is trying his/her best to be considered in the family is a manifestation of love. If he/she is complaining, that is because he/she feels like his/her love is not reciprocated accordingly and the jealousy is a result of his/her fear of losing that special someone because the love and attention he/she receives is not as much as he/she expects because he/she is sharing the love and attention with the kids. The kids are blessings and alongside with bringing them into this world is a lifetime responsibility imposed by both parents on themselves, because the kids never asked them to bring them into this world rather they both during the time they were still together, have consented to an act which both of them are aware can result in another life form. So for either of the parents to abandon their children for their own selfish desires is perverse, more so, leaving their own children to please their new found love.

I will admit that my dinner wasn't entirely paleo, although eating Thai generally makes it easier to opt for paleo meals. Well, my dinner consisted of mostly meat and vegetables, and a little bit of gluten... and corn. My drink, I'm sure, had plenty of sugar in it. It was delicious though. I had a blast Monday night. It was all around a wonderful evening.
Although there have been albums in between, Songs of the Ungrateful Living is the spiritual follow-up to his 1998 breakthrough, the multi-platinum Whitey Ford Sings the Blues, an eclectic mix of rock, blues, country, pop and hip-hop, which topped the Billboard charts and sold more than 3 million copies on the strength of its crossover hit, “What It’s Like.”

The article details the practical problems of disposing of the radioactivity, pointing out that in most other states the waste would be pumped underground again but that in New York there is no licensing for that so the plan is to the deposit the waste into the rivers providing drinking water. Theoretically, the waste was to be sent through treatment plant to remove the radioactive waste. But New York likely doesn’t have any treatment plants capable of handling the radiation. Also if the radioactive material is filtered out the result is a sludge that is so highly radioactive that there are only a few specific landfills in the country to which it can be sent.

It sounds like this winter has been mild in a lot of places. I wonder what affect that will have on the plants and critters in the spring and summer. I just hope that whatever comes up now, will not be harmed by colder weather that could yet come. We need more moisture, too. I suppose I should get some water on the new plants out there. Some of the spots are bare dirt. I hope the little roots are OK under there.

Yesterday, while browsing through the April/May 2004 issue, I came across an article which featured little handmade felt dresses, skirts and shorts by South American artist Lluba Obando Choi. I loved them, and just had to try some myself. It was fun, and again a little different than what I usually do.

On the one hand, the West is addicted to a diet that's killing us. On the other hand, we spend less than 20% of our income on food and spend less than, what, 10 hours a week? preparing food (on average).

Behaviors like public put-downs, yelling, and blaming an employee unfairly can have far-reaching effects, like decreased productivity and high turnover. Treating employees like crap can also hurt the bottom line in the long term, according to a study published by the Journal of Applied Psychology. Workers who experienced this kind of behavior were found to engage in more destructive behaviors like speaking badly about the company to outsiders and being unsupportive toward co-workers.
The narrative of Islam as the “religion of peace,” ironically, did not appear in my life till the age of the war on terror (which, granted, covers the bulk of my thinking years so far). Because in Sirah I learnt of war after war after war fought with everyone from Christians to nonbelievers, so when I think “Islam,” it’s not doves that come to mind.

The BBC has a bad French Presidential election first round. Their inbuilt left wing sympathy made them spend much time exploring the rise of the Front Left, speculating that it might replace the National Front as a home of protest. In the actual event the National Front thumped the Front Left and has placed itself in range of the ultimate prise.( Not inconceivable if the next few years bring the economic apocalypse that doesn't seem to be of put by Euro zone rescue and more European solidarity. )

Of course. I would certainly listen to what they had to say at the very least. I’d be crazy not to. Again, look at it from a business perspective. You have to understand that traditional publishers can shift tens of thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands) of books because they have the infrastructure, the money, the marketing ability, the experience, the contacts etc. etc. to do so. And like I said before, it’s very appealing to have a team of professionals around you to deal with the various facets of publishing a book. They would probably have to shift 4 to 5 times more than what I could sell as a self publisher to match my profit (yes, I said profit because it’s self-publishing, you don’t get royalties, you get profit), but that would probably be quite easy for a large publisher.
I also cut several pieces of wood to form both a shelf -- for placing some plants currently still outdoors, which will also have to come inside for the Winter -- & as a "shelter" where the tortoises can retreat to find a darker, calmer spot, in which to meet their needs of a place to conceal themselves, as they would do in nature.

We do not need an inerrant Bible to demonstrate the veracity of the historical points just mentioned. We only need a trustworthy record of Jesus’ teachings, claims, and deeds from those in a position to provide us with accurate information. So long as the salient details of Jesus’ life, teachings, and resurrection contained in the Bible are accurate, that is enough to validate Christianity as being true. And we can demonstrate that the salient details of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are firmly established as historically accurate using the standard principles of historiography employed by secular historians.

It was a rather stirring ending to the main event but Butler would return for an encore. “Jenny” saw him pair up with Felicity Groom for some genteel, acoustic folk. He then decided that because he’d spoken a lot tonight – both through his friendly, between-song banter and the thoughtful messages in his songs – he would leave us with an instrumental number. It was “Ocean” the epic, artistic piece that he described as being about peace, love, wars, killing and how he feels about his family, friends and fans. Butler says it articulates what he is unable to put into words about these wonderfully, complex topics and emotions.

I mean, is debate what we should be engaging in with non-believers? Does arguing do anything other than create in each party a greater desire to prove their own point? To “win” … ? And, do you think a non-believer is going to be brought to the Lord because your handy-dandy iPhone app provided you with a few Fast Facts? Is that going to move him/her to explore the possibilities? To a belief in and a relationship with the Lord? I dunno … just seems to cheapen your testimony. You don’t know your God well enough to convince me with what’s in your heart? You love your God so much that you rely on an iPhone app as opposed to having learned these truths through study and reflection? Or experience? If anything, wouldn’t this convince a non-believer even further of his/her point? That the God we claim to love and give our lives to, that created the universe, hasn’t changed or inspired us enough to even be able to clearly explain who He is to another person, without the help of our iPhone?

Beginners often make the mistake of not relaxing the arm during the recovery and of moving the hand too high and too far away from the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often forget to use their shoulders to let the hand enter as far forward as possible. Some say the hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely bent down, giving thrust right from the start. At the beginning of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.

Unlike Stephanie, many people freeze in a moment of panic such as this. Often when we’re faced with an intimidating situation our fear paralyzes us, and we do absolutely nothing. This is the very problem that Timothy faced in Ephesus. There were all sorts of powerful men in the church teaching things that clearly violated the Christian doctrines that God put into place. Was Timothy standing up to them? Was he rebuking them for introducing heresy in the church? Actually, Timothy was so paralyzed with fear that he was doing absolutely nothing to stop these false teachers. Paul recognized the immediate spiritual danger for the Ephesian church and admonishes Timothy:

We had a wonderful time at the beach, being with my parents and siblings and all their children. Our buckets were filled. Of the 13 grandchildren, William is the oldest and 9 of them are boys. It was wild and crazy and simply marvelous.Most of the days were cloudy and overcast in the morning before the sun made an appearance for the afternoon. This was perfect for William. He was able to run around in the sand and surf without being too uncomfortable or restricted. Due to one of his current prescriptions, his skin is very sensitive to the sun and he must be covered up and slathered up.
Nicole Haas has been writing poetry since she was a young girl and now she’s the mother of Wyatt and Cody. For the very young, she’s written a clever, rhymed tale, Freedom Bee, a Hive Story ($8.99, Tate Publishing, Mustang, OK) about a hive whose queen bee begins to demand all the pollen for herself, resulting in the worker bees losing interest in gathering it. The old hive collapses, a new one is built, and the queen learns her lesson. Along with its eye-catching illustrations, it’s a way to teach a useful lesson about individual freedom. In addition to the paper version, one can download a free audio version. Also for the pre-school set, Kathy M. Miller has authored and photographed a sequel to her first book about Chippy Chipmunk which garnered 15 national book awards. The new title is Babies in the Garden ($19.95, Celtic Sunrise) that is filled with more than 80 photos of the first days of chipmunks out of the burrow. Children 4 and older will enjoy this story of four chipmunks as they encounter birds, butterflies, rabbits, and even the resident cat!

As you plan your actions, think about your fiance to be and make sure it’s a proposal she will remember for ever, and do all you can to fit it to her personality. Consider her favourite things, people, places, and try as much as possible to incorporate it into the proposal. You could even think of getting her to do something she’s always wanted to do with you but never got round to. It says a lot when a guy gives the proposal a lot of thought and it gives you massive brownie points and respect among all her mates when she tells the story time and time again.

Herro! Blobert here with the news.
The title “Dalek War” is a little misleading since it promotes the idea that this is some kind of action-packed extravaganza with Daleks trundling rampant, killing everyone and everything in sight. That isn’t quite the case, and yet it doesn’t make the set itself any less of an extravaganza from a presentation standpoint. Both stories have been given a thorough overhaul, and they’ve never looked better than they do here. Where the real magic becomes apparent, however, is in Episode Three of “Planet,” which has existed only in black and white for the past 30 some odd years – until now. Several techniques, including the new kid on the block, color recovery, have been joined together to achieve this feat, and the results are astounding. Visually, the differences between it and the other five episodes of the story are negligible. “The Silurians” colorization from “Beneath the Surface” was impressive, but this restoration leaves that one in the dust.

In my Roman Mysteries I was meticulous about getting historical details, events and people as accurately as possible, but I made my hero – the 10-year-old detectrix Flavia Gemina – as independent as any 21st century schoolgirl. Maybe more so. I needed to make Flavia and her pals accessible so that children could identify with them and enter the world and so absorb the details of the period. It was a balancing act, challenging but fun. I tried not to let too many inaccuracies creep in, but one or two per book were necessary.

Barsoom is farther from the sun than Terra. It's smaller. It has a thinner atmosphere. It's closer to the asteroid belt. These factors all played a part in Barsoomian evolution progressing much more rapidly than Terran evolution.
But I never did find out exactly what the Latino Consent Decree is, or was, or might have been. It happened in the 1970s, and continues to compel Minnesota taxpayers to fund the activities described above, year after year.

I recently wrote about linguistic inflation for Macmillan Dictionary Blog, asking self-referentially if the phenomenon was “insanely awesome”. John Petrie, in a comment, told me about a “Campaign to Stamp Out Awesome”. The person responsible calls it a “nauseatingly ubiquitous (and by now, completely meaningless) superlative”. He sells stickers with this message.
I would avoid main alpha cities, but still be close enough to large ones, Beta and Gamma cities, cities with a population of 250.000 or 300.000 give or take. This is important in case you end up needing more advanced medical care and trips to the city become more frequent, or if for financial reasons you or your wife are forced to find a job and none happen to be available in the population 50.000 city you happen to live in.

You can count them on two hands. Maybe you’d have to count with your toes. There aren’t many, but they’re out there. Some singers and musicians have the knack for taking an old sound and making it entirely their own. They don’t sound derivative. They don’t sound like a cover or tribute artist. They’re not blatant ripoffs. At the same time, they sound entirely familiar. Part of their appeal is that they have captured the best of what came before them.
While we got them for a cheaper price they were brand new (had only been swatched) so I'm going to review these as if we'd bought them brand new and paid the £14 Space N charges for Lime Crime.

*Note: Depending on how spicy you like it, you can use more or less red pepper. The one teaspoon here gives it a pretty good kick, so I'd try that first before using more. However, I would not recommend omitting it altogether unless you are adding meat to the sauce, which will give it some extra flavor.

My family life was stable and possessing and displaying good character was stressed. Even the hardcore gang members would make sure you were going to school, staying away from drugs and reading comic books instead of hanging out with them if they deemed you to have the potential to do something better with your life. Hell, the leader of the gang in my neighborhood was an avid fan of rock music and paid me to teach him how to play Dungeons and Dragons. Like I said, atypical.
We urge Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak to conduct a thorough and swift investigation, and charge those responsible for these violent acts, including those allegedly committed by police personnel towards journalists. Compensation must also be given to those whose equipment have been deliberately damaged. The Prime Minister must also adopt firm measures to ensure all uniformed personnel understand and respect the role of journalists.
And let me tell you, if something like this ever happens to my husband’s truck? Heaven help the neighborhood…

The best way to sale a used car back then involved listing it in the “Carolina Trader”, a local classified advertisement paper with a very dedicated readership always looking for a bargain. My wife called the paper about my car on a Thursday with the advertisement appearing in the new edition on sale the following Monday afternoon around four o’clock. Some will no doubt think I am exaggerating but I arrived home from work about that time and the phone started ringing less than thirty minutes later. Right then I should have known something was very wrong.
In 2010, we applied for Anna’s visa. We were given a 12 month tourist visa which was promptlt stamped with the 676 No Further Stay condition.

A couple of decades ago, in preparation to repaint the master bathroom in our house, I removed the mirror, and leaned it against the wall in our bedroom. The cat came in; paraded back and forth in front of it, then walked behind it.

No, my bag is not "perfect" - but it's mine. I made it. And I had fun making it. And that'd be enough right there to make me love it.
My love of supple coeds and astute blood-shedding is repeatedly put to test in Pieces, as both come in close contact with one another with an uncomfortable regularity. The fact that the majority of the victims all had it going on in terms of being attractive didn't help matters. As wonderfully shameless as it is, this heady mix of alluring and bloodcurdling had me questioning my loyalties at every turn. Take, for example, the aerobics sequence. A scene like this is my reason for living (I was like a malnourished kid in a leotard store). The synthesizer music (with vocoder-enhanced vocals), the kicking in unison, the super tight exercise clothes, and the overall chromatic splendour of it all was a thing of perverted beauty. Only problem is, one of them has to be murdered to move the plot forward. It's quite the dilemma, and it's not the only time it happens. Every coed who comes face-to-face with the killer's chainsaw is just so darn cute and sexy, that it's a shame they all have to be violated in such a grotesque, yet highly creative manner. Just for the record, the waterbed stabbing and toilet evisceration were my favourite death sequences.
But of course it is not to be. Islam will not allow non-Islamic people to live next door to them in peace, and so this terrible onslaught of violence waged against innocents will continue until the final day of reckoning.

I have a a feeling this movie’s message is ‘If you don’t accept the way I live my life or the choices I’ve made, then you don’t love me and you’re a hater’. But that’s not the message of the Catholic Church. So not only does the movie miss the mark on portraying faithful Catholics accurately – sinners who struggle but keep getting back up and not caricatures of nosy busybodies who have to control everything and everybody (sad to say that there are some people like that – ever go into a Catholic blog combox at some places?) – but it purposely errs on Church teaching as well. But then again, anyone going to a Hollywood movie for catechesis might not be all that interested in what the Church has to say anyway.

Seriously, why do some children think they need to stick things up their nose. I would have thought he would have learned from the screw incident of 2010. Apparently, that trauma wasn't lodged deeply enough in his brain.
It is a singular but instructive fact that the desire on the part of some to exalt this sacrament, as the means of inducing regeneration, has led to a depreciation of this term, by a lowering of the spiritual value of its connotation. Inasmuch as facts will not allow us to affirm that the administration of the ordinance is followed, in the vast majority of cases, by any moral results that can be discerned, it has been concluded by many who belong to the High Church school that the benefits of regeneration are not to be looked for (at any rate directly) in the moral region; the grace that is bestowed is a capacity or potentiality rather than any thing that affects us consciously; it is the implanting of a germ, which may or may not develop and fructify, rather than the occurrence of a moral or spiritual revolution.
Go ahead. Give yourself permission to be grateful. Somedays it's harder than others, particularly if the kids are sick, the car won't start, or you've missed an appointment. But I firmly believe being grateful helps us get through the tough days a little easier. I look forward to reviewing these posts a while from now and, with any luck, it will remind me what a full life I have, making any difficult days just a tad better.

While this language doesn't support the DNC's argument about a mandate, it's the same type of argument that conservatives are litigating against in Obamacare. They say the withholding of Medicaid payments unless states expand the program is illegal control of the state governments by the federal government, and that's exactly what Romney wanted to do with the mandate program - require states to impose mandates or lose their funding. While this argument isn't expected to do very well, the Supreme Court decided to consider it.

The thing to keep in mind is that everyone was in the booze business during this time period. Grocery stores, pharmacies, soda fountains, and almost any merchant you can think of sold some type of alcohol. In the 1840's the average person drank twice as much alcohol as today. It was part of daily living, and was considered good for you. With that kind of consumption, the demand for booze was high, and sales were unregulated as well. The result was a tavern, grog shop, or liquor vendor within easy reach almost anywhere.

Everyone in heaven had wings; Colton’s were smaller than most. He learned that the righteous, including his father, would fight in a coming last battle.
Currently, Rattlesnake Figure (Carving), 2010, is Houseago at his best. This hunk of redwood, as Leah Ollman correctly observed in the Times, has “the latent energy of Michelangelo’s slaves.” However, I am finding that I can go much further. Houseago pairs Michelangelo’s Dying Slave, 1513-1516 with German Expressionist wood carving (which Ollman also mentions). This is no mere happenstance. The Platonism that drove Michelangelo, his belief that a figure resides in the rock, that its very essence is part of the rock whether or not Michelangelo released it, directly communicates with the Romanticism that drove many Germans up to Baselitz and Balkenhol. The mysticism of the German forest implies its ability to whisper primal secrets into the ear of a hiker or a philosopher on a walk. That a forest can take on a archetype or mythological persona that could drive sculpture, does not seem to be lost on Houseago. These are two very different and quite complicated visions of sculptural essence, and Houseago finds both, Platonic and Romantic, in the same piece of wood.

Listening to Increasing Our High, your feet tap and head sways, and when the gravely lyrics rise above the distorted guitar, you start to wonder: what’s this guy so angry about? Everything. He’s pissed about money, pissed about rules. He’s pissed about women and power, peoples’ perceptions and what the world expects from him. He works shitty jobs (“Dirty Work”) for low pay and he’s mad about it, though not mad enough to quit drinking so much beer and sitting around stoned watching TV (“Bum”) to pursue a better line of work. Yet beyond the particular sources of his ire, lies an indiscriminate, almost adolescent rage. Vasquez is just pissed, period, one of those fiery guys who might have been born with a chip on their shoulder and who give you the finger simply because they can.

Speaking of the Wall, the first Pink Floyd album where Waters wrote all the lyrics, one new observation I made of his choice lyric pattern became apparent while hearing “Mother” from that album, “Brain Damage” from Dark Side of the Moon, “Wish You Were Here” from the album of the same name and “If” from Atom Heart Mother (maybe others?). He changes the number of syllables per line every so often and ever so slightly in an odd but still rhythmic pattern that bolsters the impact of his words, which are often very self-reflexive, tortured and existential. It clearly makes him the stand out lyricist of the band.
The skiing season in Gulmarg usually commences before Christmas (around middle of December) and continues till middle of April. In January-February, 1998 the first National Winter Games of India were held at Gulmarg, for which the facilities were enormously improved and upgraded. The resort acquired two Kasse Bohrer snow beating machines used for preparing skiing slopes, and five snowmobiles, which can be made available for going up the mountain. Good quality equipment, including skis, boots, sticks, gloves and goggles are available on hire on the spot from the Government-run ski shop.

I have evolved into a new online life that I still defining. Yesterday I chatted with a woman from Wales by accident on facebook, at least I believe that she is a human being. I am doing job searches that are so much more intensive than any that I would have done back 30 years ago. Back in the 70′s I would have taken my pack and been hitchhiking down the road feeling bad but knowing in my heart that things where going to work out ok in the end. They usually did with a few adventures inbetween.I hooked up one time with a buddy, after getting fired from a railroad crew( falling down drunk we dismantled the bunk house) and flew one way into a remote northern mining town( with enough money for a couple of beer) because we heard that they were hiring just about anybody. They were and we were hired on the spot. I worked that job until the spring and left with the snow back down south to join in the summer party that stretched across the prairies.I sobered up at summers end, in Calgary, just in time to join the railroad again.
There was no doubt in my mind this song would be number one. I’m talking the original Johnny and June but if you automatically think Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix that’s okay, too. The important thing is that you know who Johnny Cash and June Carter are!
At every beach, there are familiar landmarks. For Pasir Ris Beach, this is one familiar sight.
The blurb tells you the plot pretty much as simply as it is possible to put. It’s a difficult one to explain without giving away too much, and I’m not going to even try. What I can say about the book, however, is that it’s hilarious. It’s fairly easy to see which bits are probably Gaiman and which Pratchett, particularly if you’ve read both, but they work together splendidly. My particular favourite bits tend to be the discussions between the angel Aziraphale (former Guardian of the Eastern Gate of Eden) and the demon Crowley (former Serpent in the Garden of Eden); after all, when you spend thousands of years with someone, a friendship tends to form, no matter what side you are on. I don’t think it’s possible to read their legendary Drunk Conversation with a straight face. Another favourite is a certain Rider of the Apocalypse who runs a diet and fast food company – his bits have some of my favourite quotes. (You can see I haven’t quoted anything. This is because they A) often require the whole setting to work or B) might spoil the fun reading them yourself provides.)
Can it be about me?

Dogs have an innate ability to read body language that as humans we don’t. Trainers and behaviorists spend countless hours learning and developing their own skills to read body language so they can communicate with dogs and understand the meaning of the of the body language displayed by the animal.
Last week I drank in my vacation in small increments -stopping to breathe in the peace of not being responsible for work. I spent time reading and eating, and sleeping the deep sleep of one without extra burdens.
I may have overdosed on red in this house, which could explain why you'll find little of it in our house now. We ended up selling the iron table and chairs on Craigslist. Apparently, wrought iron isn't kind to little heads who happen to run into it. . . .

And thank goodness she did because the world needed her literature a lot more than it needed another lawyer. In 1977, Silko published Ceremony. On the surface, the plot seems a lot like House Made of Dawn, except that Ceremony is the book that changed my life, and House Made of Dawn is just a book I like. Ceremony tells the story of Tayo, a fellow mixedblood who returns to the reservation after World War II suffering from serious PTSD and a heavy conscience due to the battlefield death of his cousin whom everyone held high expectations for. The black sheep of his community, Tayo drifts through his days in a hallucinatory haze becoming more and more alienated from a toxic world full of substance-soaked illusion and forces of destruction.

We are still hoping to own The Goddamn House someday, but have decided to buy everything else in the city in the meantime. We're looking at both investment properties and back-up homes for The Goddamn House, so we've been studying listings, obsessing over houses, and writing offers all over the place.
In 1991 Roy Schwasinger went before a senate committee to present evidence of the banks and governments criminal activity. He informed them how the Corporation of the United States was tied to the establishment of a New World Order which would bring about a fascist one world government ruled by the international bankers. So in 1992 a task force was put together consisting of over 300 retired and 35 active US military officers who strongly supported constitutional law.* This task force was responsible for investigating governmental officials, congressional officers, judges, and the Federal Reserve.
I stopped in at my local, L'Insolent, for a feeling-sorry-for-myself drink. I told Afsanet, my friendly barmaid, of my problems. She handed me a card and said, "The X-Ray place is down the street." Just go there. And it was. And I did. And they took me right away, without an appointment. And it only cost me 35 Euros ($50). And I found my vaccination record from when I was a baby. I know. Incredible. But I haven't been in the hospital lately - not since I had a boob job and nose job 30 years ago and my uterus boiled 4 years ago. I don't have those documents. I figured I'd just show the doctor how I can make my boobs dance and that would be enough.

He’d realised a long time ago that people like their routines. “Creature of habit” he muttered as he watched the man from no. 26 shambling along the road to fetch his paper. Tom knew that the old guy left his house at five to seven every day, to reach the newsagents just as it opened. The shuffling walk was accompanied by the tap of a walking-stick, click-scuff-scuff, click-scuff-scuff; the sounds beat a rhythm as regular as the old man’s routine, he’d know it with his eyes shut.

Deep Garnett, earthy colour. A lifted nose of leather, herbs, coffee, figs, plums, oak and smoke. Lovely rich fruit in the mouth, fresh and dried, with supple tannins, savoury flavours, leather, earthy, sweet and sour nuances – almost saline at times. This is multi-layered, complex and fine. I thought this was a glorious wine, perhaps the fact that this was from magnum made it especially good – 92/100 points.
I had a conversation with my dog yesterday that was waaaaay more interesting than anything Lubiano could ever say. Can any student taking one of her classes get their money back? Or how do I apply for a position in her department? I'm pretty sure I write just as well as she does, and I have many more interesting stories. How can Duke survive with crap like that?
On the back ground of the tag I used shabby shutters and spun sugar distress inks before covering in clear embossing powder and heating up. I then inked on Victorian velvet and walnut stain to ooze into the dips.
Bewitched. I Dream of Jeannie. The Exorcist. Charmed. Buffy. Dr. Who. Dracula. Dark Shadows. Twilight and The Twilight Zone. Sookie Stackhouse and Bill Compton. Dresden Files. Harry Potter. The fascination and appeal of magic and supernatural entities pervades societies and cultures. The continuing appeal of these characters is a testimony to how they shape our daydreams and our nightmares, as well as how we yearn for something that is “more” or “beyond” what we can see-touch-taste-feel. Children still avoid stepping on cracks, lovers pluck petals from a daisy, cards are dealt and tea leaves read.

It should worry us that we do not invent things. We do not go to the moon. Our societies are not well-organised. We have the shortest lifespan of all the races. Something must be wrong with us. Why are we not like others? Our scholars will be quick to say that these are not the only ways of measuring intelligence. They will quote other scholars to adumbrate their point, but the fact remains that we are not showing intelligence. Others are showing it more than we're doing. If they are not more intelligent than we are, let someone tell me how to put it. God himself must be frustrated with his black children. They must be an embarrassment to him. He has given us everything he has given to other of his children; why are his black children not manifesting their own gift?

The main reasons parents give their kids their first drink is because they want them to have it in a safe environment, have a conversation about drinking, and be a bigger influence on their attitude toward alcohol than their friends. (The Scotsman)

The pattern I used for this quilt is High Seas by Lizzy House, from her 5 Magical Projects book (all using 1001 Peeps). I used a bunch of different fabrics when making it, including lots of Outfoxed (in the blue/coral colourway), Denyse Schmidt, various Kona Solids, and some Amy Butler. The pattern did call for a border, but I decided not to - I like the way the waves appear to continue off the sides of the quilt.

*) The MDL is said to have taken ‘inspiration from the black power movement of 1960s American’. More specifically, we are talking about the Black Panthers group. What was that? Well, for a start, its members were racists, black supremacists, Muslim supremacists, misogynists - and that’s just for starters. But they were black, so SWP/UAF types think that this black racism, misogyny, machismo, etc. is OK because blacks, as well as the Muslim browns, are part of the Victim Class of ‘white imperialism’ … vomit.

4. Maintain My New Body/Run More. I worked incredibly hard to actually hit my weight loss goal that I am going to need to put in the time and effort to maintain my new body. Instead of "Operation Dumbo Drop" there on the side of my blog, I have put a Maintaining Log for 2012. This is kind of a two-fold resolution in the fact that I'd really like to add up my running miles this year and try to beat my goals every month. This is the resolution I am most excited about and I pray that my old 31 year old muscles will help me achieve this goal. We shall see...

I don't really understand why they couldn't just drop my niece in Phoenix on their way to Vegas. That seems like far less hassle, not to mention much cheaper. But when I asked, my brother said they couldn't get the flights to work out, blah blah whatever.

The problem-to-solution approach from the CSS Cookbook is great and it’s already helping me to understand the importance of using particular types of coding to allow for easy adaptation to HTML5 when it is finalised and accepted by the majority of newer browsers, and also to look and function in an acceptable way if really old browsers look at the site. This is important as the site must look presentable and professional to a broad range of people. Most visitors to this site will have good standards of technology, but some members of the site demographic groups may not use the latest versions of browsers or other technologies.

The concept of ‘form’ has always interested me; it is in many ways a fleeting concept and yet given a lot of weight by those who comment on our nation’s favourite sports. It’s both a catch all term used to define whether someone is generally doing things right or doing things wrong but also a relative term balancing a performance in one moment of time with a performance once made or a potential or optimum performance. Thus, if I play football to my normal standard I am on form whilst if Theo Walcott plays like me he is off form.
I'm bored with my regular routine so I'm putting off house cleaning until Friday so the house will hopefully still be clean when everyone comes for Sunday lunch.
The glittery snowflakes were made by die cutting plain white snowflakes, adding a little colour to the centres using promarkers, I then completely covered each snowflake with Glossy Accents and then coated with Glamour dust, bit messy and fiddly but the final result was worth it. I also glitzed up the little white mulberry poinsettias by dismantling them and coating the layers with glossy accents and glamour dust, I then reassembled them and added some silver spacers and pearls for the centres. The cute "With love to you at Christmas" stamp is from Stamping All Day, there's a link in my sidebar if you fancy a look.

Julia had such a great time with her Daddy at the local park that I thought I would post some pics from the evening! She is not afraid of climbing on the larger play areas and is always watching the bigger kids. There was a Chinese girl playing with her friends and she must have been about 10 and she asked us if we were Julias parents and then after we said "yes" she said um um ummmm well....I used to look like her when I was little. It was so cute...Julia kept staring at her and she kept staring at Julia. I often wonder what goes through Julias mind at that moment.

Pauline is an eternal optimist. She shares stories of optimism on her website and features videos of how she has triumphed over the things that are challenges for someone without arms or legs. She has learned how to feed herself, use the computer and even drive! She doesn’t believe in the word “can’t.” Her website, Small Victories, is a place for those who feel down or are in need of inspiration to come and read and share stories of success. She currently serves as a motivational speaker and a source for inspiration for those with disabilities, and recently Pauline collaborated with author Les Brown to feature her story in his book, Fight For Your Dreams
The least Sajid Khan could have done to have at least one thing correct in his new movie HOUSEFULL 2 would have been to spell the word correctly! Perhaps he introduced the extra L in the title to signify the lousy nature of the movie! And yet, despite having turned out an extremely mediocre comedy, he has been richly rewarded by the Houseful boards at the theatre screening this movie. So one thing is certain: HOUSEFULL 3 will be on its way!
You know, I never think about the reader per se. When I edit, I obviously aim for clarity for the reader’s sake but she is not in my head as I write. So how the story is perceived doesn’t come into my writing equation. I don’t workshop my fiction so usually the first inkling I get of whether something has worked or not is from an editor’s perspective. And I prefer it that way.
Can't travel 500 miles up the country without eating though, most especially with children. Motorway services have never been a favourite but avoiding them is near impossible. Our plan has always been to scoff our own road-rubbish limiting service stops for caffeine fill-ups. With kids in tow the quality of our road-rubbish has gone up; now it even includes some of our five-a-day. Blimey. Fruit? In a car? What happened to the wotsits? But the caffeine fuel remains essential; as does the opportunity to let the kids run free. They don't take well to being strapped down for hours on end, especially toddler girl who announced 'I want to walk' in a very loud voice just hours into our mammoth drive up north. With impeccable timing she chose to drop off mere minutes before our service-stops which left her less that cheerful on the return to the car. By the time we reached Carlisle I was quite prepared to let her out for the much demanded 'walk' - all the way to Edinburgh. Thank god for strawberries. These red lovelies proved to be the saviour of our sanity. Both the wee ones happily munched them while we let the i-pod shuffle us up the motorway.

Speaking of progress, my youngest two who will be in 5th grade next year have informed me that they want to homeschool again. Both say they are tired of the way the kids in school behave. Since one is autistic, I can really see for myself how he stands out and the kids treat him like some weirdo. He is becoming more aware of it now that he's getting older which is sad. I'd almost he remain oblivious and believe that everyone is his friend.

The Long Crendon Rec’ is one of those places I’d driven past far too many times not to have seen a game there. It’s basic, a typical village sportsfield, shared with cricket, the changing room block at one end. What makes it special is the surroundings, the trees, the thatched roofs, even the pub gate backing on to the ground. The local school used to use this place as its playing field, that became a village centre, it did seem strange to see gaming machines in something still so scholastic!
So I began to ride her once a week, for the purpose of jumping with her. She was amazing and well, hot tempered. The great trouble with Amalia is that she thinks she can do it all on her own and she wants the rider to just hang on (for dear life) and let her handle it. Most time she is right, I must give her that, she is really good but she can not read numbers so it is a problem when you compete if the horse suddenly goes the wrong way.
