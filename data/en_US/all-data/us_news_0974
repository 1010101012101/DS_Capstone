Be cool yourself: "Bees are defensive, not aggressive ... and they also gorge on honey before they leave the hive, because they don't know when they're going to get groceries again. So they're kind of fat and happy, too." Don't spray a swarm with water or insecticide or throw rocks.

It appears Cudi is headed down a rabbit hole of Marshall half-stacks and psychedelic rock, and tracks such as “Marijuana” and other stand-outs from his criminally slept-on second album could very well become mere artifacts. And it’s a shame, because the progression from his first album to second was vast and encouraging and even hinted his rap style could still grow into something sharper. Instead, we wait with skepticism and trepidation for the next leak from an album we probably won’t want or need. Strange, indeed.

Richardson and Nerinx freshman whiz Racette opened a gap on the rest of the field coming into the final half mile of the race.

She passed Racette halfway down the hill and pulled away down the home stretch to win by 6.6 seconds.
From there it was all downhill, with Meshkin, board Chairman Sandra French and former chairman Frank Aquino airing petty complaints and swapping accusations of deceit and lying, and Allen Dyer unexpectedly chiming in with the request that members drop their effort to impeach him, presumably since what was happening on the board was so much worse than anything he ever did.

Likewise, the dark visions of Dominguez (born 1947) are at once personal and mythic. The title of his sugar-lift etching "Mujer Murcielago" -- "Murcielago Woman" -- references a very famous Spanish bull that survived the ring: A figure that is half-woman, half-bull takes form in a cloud of swirling black lines. And his hypnotic, almost demonic "Jose Marti" is a portrait study of the great 19th-century Cuban poet and political philosopher.

In the case of Chernobyl, United Nations reports have estimated that fewer than 50 people had died of causes directly related to radiation exposure. Most were rescue workers who had received high radiation doses; 28 died within the first few months. As many as 4,000 people are expected to eventually die of radiation-related causes. A 2005 report said about 4,000 thyroid cancers were directly related to radiation exposure, mostly in people who were children or adolescents at the time of the disaster and drank milk highly contaminated with radioactive iodine. At least nine died.

At the end of the World Series, the Indians exercised a $7 million option in Carmona's contract for 2012. He put that contract in jeopardy by playing under a false name. At least two sources say the Indians have a good case if they want to void the contract, but that doesn't appear to be their intent. If they didn't want Carmona, they could have traded him or made him a free agent by not picking up his option. Besides, if Carmona can't get out of the Dominican Republic, he won't be paid anyway.

There are pockets of hope. In Minnesota, resistance to building a new stadium for the Vikings has been fierce—so much so that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell popped in the other day to deliver a not-so-subtle message. He surely let it be known that he's got Los Angeles on speed dial, ready to send them another team if the Land of a Thousand Lakes won't agree to pay for more than half of a $1 billion stadium that owner Zygi Wilf (estimated net worth: $1.3 billion) just has to have.

Both UV-A and UV-B radiation have been shown to be harmful to the eye. While UV-A has lower energy, it does penetrate deep into the eye and may injure the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sight in the center field of vision. UV-B radiation is presumably more dangerous because it is short wavelength radiation with higher energy. UV-B is mainly absorbed by the cornea and lens of the eye and can damage those tissues.

"We've played very well the first two games but we come away empty because we just haven't been able to make one extra play," coach Rick Carlisle said. "We've got to turn that in Game 3, and it's not as simple as just coming home and it's just going to happen. We have to make it happen."

Truth to tell, with Ned gone, the second season is slightly more difficult to fathom at first because Ned provided a kind of through-line, since he had the job of being the king's hand and was more of a family man, compared with some of the more barbaric tribes. We got to know Ned, his wife, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), and their kids. Now, with Ned gone, it's up to eldest son Robb (Richard Madden) to seek justice for his father's death.
The personification of these Royals so far is Eric Hosmer, busting with promise and often crushing big-league pitching while trying to get out of his head that he's hitting around .200 for a fan base that expected so much more.

* The Rams, as expected, rejected the CVC's initial plan to spruce up The Edward Jones Dome. The key words being: as expected. So let's hope the Chicken Littles among the fringe media and some of the more hysterical fans can hold off from rushing into the streets in an instantaneous state of full-blown arousal. Please remain calm. Please refrain from fear mongering. Please take sedatives if it helps. This is a necessary step in the negotiating process, and nothing more. The Rams' choice to decline merely moves us closer to actual negotiations. The Rams have until May 1 to make a counteroffer to the CVC. This gives both sides time to discuss the situation, and see if they can find common ground. And if the CVC rejects the Rams' counteroffer -- as I would expect -- it's not the end of the game. I don't think anything can really be accomplished until all of these procedural datelines are out of the way. That's when the real talks will begin.

Boop is so down on gas grills, he pretty much refuses to use them. "I'd rather be a vegetarian than ruin a good piece of meat," he told me just yesterday. Look, don't pay too much attention to Boop.

Anyway, if you're stuck with gas-lava-charcoal, try using some of those expensive wood chips they sell at BBQ stores, or rip that loose board off your neighbor's fence.

Yes, there's the foie gras, an enviable wine list and French influences throughout. But the vigilant orbit of chef/owner Gabriel Rucker -- the James Beard Foundation's 2011 Rising Star Chef of the Year -- makes this place. He chats up diners, picks music on Pandora and guides staff in his clean open kitchen, all while ensuring plates come out impeccably presented, crouching down close to sculpt them just so. He fields questions about the mache -- a salad of lamb's lettuce and tangy grilled celery root, mellowed by brie and almonds. He slow-roasts lamb shoulder all night before deep frying it for a carnitas-like texture on the outside, then flanks it with lemony green-garlic fennel risotto, tomatoes and strings of curried pickled fennel.

There is a pervasive myth in America that strong leaders can, through force of will, take the country in new directions. Such directors of change are rare, if they exist at all. Franklin Roosevelt came to power when the people were ready for social change, and his ideas were an extension of existing state-based reforms. When Roosevelt tried to direct change through packing the Supreme Court or intervening in Democratic congressional primaries, the public rose up and swatted him down. Ronald Reagan did not direct a conservative revolution either; he channeled and gave voice to a growing public dissatisfaction with government. Reagan got his tax and regulatory reform and his defense increases. But he never unraveled the New Deal safety net. He never brought the force of the American people into his battle against communism in Central America. Like Roosevelt, Reagan facilitated changes percolating up from the people.

As bizarre and unlikely and indeed impossible as this revelation is, as much as he first wants to deny it, it doesn't take long before he realizes that this extraordinary piece of information actually makes sense, that it even sheds light on so many of the senseless things that have happened to him in life. The pieces of the puzzle fall into place, and he knows that a great and simple truth has been revealed to him: his identity, the essence of his being. His IS a wizard, the child of two remarkable wizards who had died trying to save his life, and that truth goes on to guide everything he does, every choice he makes, from that moment on.

between the fish and rice balls, leaving slices of red snapper and tuna especially bland. Not all was for naught, however. I liked the smoky, salty flavor of the cured mackerel, and I thought the shrimp tempura roll was a step up from the usual fake-crab California option. Being from Pennsylvania, I have a weakness for an occasional Philadelphia roll (smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber). The Mr. Sushi roll uses unsmoked salmon and swaps avocado and asparagus for the cucumber. What can I say? It works.

There are no absolutes here. For one thing, there isn't a single umbrella way for any journalist to do a thorough background search on any subject. Years of police procedural TV shows have led many viewers to believe computer database searches of criminal histories and fingerprints are instantaneous and definitive, but that's an almost laughably fictionalized version of how actual criminal records searches work.

Ball to Oregon State, and game to the Beavers.
When we exited the elevator on the fourth floor, we were greeted with a lobby for patients and visitors, a consultation room, and a long white expanse of hallway. Everything is white — the floors, ceilings, doorways, and walls; everything is spotlessly clean and hospital-like .

I recognized artwork by the likes of Picasso, Monet, and Renoir, all framed in unbreakable materials.

1:09 -- TOUCHDOWN -- The Giants add another score on a 10-yard pass from Manning to Bradshaw, but the drive was fueled by Henry Hynoski, who had 3 catches on the drive and a hurdle over Terence Newman. Yes, the same Terence Newman who Bear Pascoe leaped over in the first quarter. If it's not Newman's worst game, it's at least his most embarrassing. Those two guys aren't exactly leapers. The extra point makes it 21-0, Giants. That's the biggest lead the Giants have had since...well, it's the biggest lead the Giants have had this season. So for the first time, we'll see the Giants play with a comfortable lead this early in a game. And it couldn't have come at a bigger time.

Since moving to St. Louis in 1995 the Rams have made a series of risky coaching hires. Their first HC, Oregon's Rich Brooks, was pulled from the college ranks. Steve Ortmayer, the GM at the time, made the hire because team president John Shaw was consumed by negotiating the Rams' move from Los Angeles to St. Louis. Brooks was and is a good football man, but the NFL didn't fit him well. After winning his first four games as Rams coach, Brooks went 9-19, lost control of the locker room, and was fired after the 1996 season.

Loaded question. It is both rewarding and challenging. The reward is to actually see people's lives change positively, to see their faith stretched and increased, to see minds and attitudes change.

It has been a challenge, but one in which we have been graced to have victory and success.
But what is it exactly that hooks you, and why? For me, it comes down to a few fundamental truths: The game is fast and dangerous, which makes it thrilling.

Watch for Facebook "like" scams. Facebook will generally alert you via a pop-up window and ask you to confirm your actions if it is not confident in a link you are accessing. If you have already mistakenly clicked on a link that added to your "likes and interests" on Facebook, you will need to edit your interests on your profile and remove any links to spam sites you may have acquired. Do this by selecting "edit my profile" by your profile image. Next, click "likes and interests" and remove anything suspicious. If you see something strange coming from the Facebook account of someone else, you know what I'm going to say: be a "Facebook friend" in the best sense and let the account-holder know.

My long view begins with the gas line days of 1973-74, when a recently minted owner of a 1966 Ford Falcon began the daily commute between his home in Arbutus and Gilman School in Roland Park. Domestically, huge price hikes at the pump and draconian gas rationing (remember the "even-odd" license plate system?) nearly destroyed new automobile sales, a crushing burden for a father employed as a "commission only" car salesman. Fortunately, the Ehrlichs survived; we also took note as our elected leaders promised that "never again" would an OPEC cartel impose its will on a defenseless America; "never again" would hostile regimes be able to inflict such damage on the world's most vibrant economy.
