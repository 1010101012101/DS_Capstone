In fact, there's nothing peaceful in a jump from the bridge. Once a person dives, depending on where he or she jumps, the body plummets 240 to 250 feet in four seconds, traveling about 75 mph, and hits the water with the force of a speeding truck meeting a concrete building. Some die instantly from extensive internal injuries; others drown in their own blood.

That’s when Jordyn Peck, a sophomore, started Shaker Heights’ run. He scored two field goals and had an assist on another. That seemed to energize the Raiders, who started to run and force the issue. That, along with controlling the boards, earned the Raiders the momentum and eventually the lead. Peck finished with 13 points, four rebounds and four assists.
If there was a season to get the new "Big Three,'' it was the debut campaign. Miami had unexpected growing pains and some obvious flaws: point guard and depth. It was there for the taking, and the Bulls couldn't take it.

Standing on a glass bridge peering into the water below, a young girl had a question too urgent to wait for a staff member. "Mom, what is that?" she asked. Her mother identified the creature as a black-tip reef shark, swimming just a few inches below us. The experience was sort of like snorkeling among sharks and rays - without getting wet.

The report credits the change to "strong pregnancy prevention messages."

Rio de Janeiro: Rio enjoys a reputation as a dreamy, steamy city, but there's far more to the place than bronzed beauties in thongs. Start with breakfast on the terrace of the elegant Mama Ruisa, an airy 19th century villa turned guesthouse in Santa Teresa, Rio's trendy boho village. Then take a stroll around Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, the iconic saltwater lagoon on the city's beach strip, ending at Fasano al Mare restaurant in the Fasano Hotel for lunch with a prime view of Ipanema Beach (and the aforementioned bodies). Head to Arpoador Beach for a swim with the surfers, then catch the tram back to Santa Teresa, stopping for a quick pop at Bar do Gomez, a colorful local watering hole spilling onto the cobbled streets. If you're still hungry after trying the empanadas, spend the evening eating artisanal Brazilian food on the jungley patio of Aprazivel, also in Santa Teresa.

Hey, Hoynsie: Last week a man claiming to be Kevin Kouzmanoff's friend said he didn't sign with the Indians because they wouldn't offer him incentives. If he's right, why would the Indians not offer incentives? If he doesn't make them, it doesn't cost any money. If he does, I would assume they would be worth paying for. -- Tom Goodsite, Kirksville, Mo.
Los Angeles city government still has not reckoned with the defining question of what constitutes its "core" services and what it can afford not to do. It has properly protected the Police Department, closed a few small agencies and consolidated some functions. That work should continue, and Villaraigosa should lead it. He has barely a year left as mayor. He would burnish his legacy and leave this city on sounder footing if he would devote his remaining time to balancing the budget and fixing the defects that have created this structural problem.

Would Jets owner Woody Johnson have fired then-head coach Eric Mangini had the Jets made the playoffs that year? Highly unlikely. And if Mangini stayed, then a certain defensive coordinator in Baltimore with the famous bloodlines wouldn’t have gotten his big break.
By breeding a mouse that can live without the SIRT1 gene, Sinclair showed otherwise. His study is published in the journal Cell Metabolism. Mice who lacked the SIRT1 gene got no benefit from Resveratrol. But those that had the gene responded to Resveratrol with improved vascular and metabolic function, reduced inflammation and overall, cells that use fuel and clean up waste more efficiently. Even chubby mice responded to Resveratrol with improved function.
"It's abstinence-based, but realistic about what can come from unprotected sex," said Beth Horner, assistant superintendent of Columbia schools.

It happened a year ago at Stanford during the second phase of her technical sport. She had gone from one left-foot hop to another smoothly enough. But by the time she landed on her right foot, ready to spring forward into the pit, she had veered off course. Instead of landing squarely on the runway, McLain hit the concrete edge of the runway where it meets the sandpit.
Whatever the culprit, I need to do something. Or rather, keep doing something. Balance isn't nearly as much fun to work on as strength, agility and speed, but I know it's every bit as important, central to daily life and long-term functionality.
“If anybody calls me, I would say I think he does have a different outlook on things,” Dungy said. “This is not a guy that’s going to take anything for granted.

"It would be undeniable that they were targeted for criticism and undermined by Dr. McCollom," assistant Prosecutor Barbara Marburger wrote in a memo to commissioners last March.

McCallin: Unfortunately what you are seeing in Colorado is that because state funding has gone down most recently from $706 million to a little under $500 million for state institutions, there's been a switch and what happens is that when state funding goes down, some of the cost of public education is going on to the student. About five years ago approximately 60-70 percent for the funding of higher education was coming from the state. Today that is flipped: 60-70 percent is coming from the student.

That show was a dark comedy. What few laughs "NYC 22" has are subtle, although Kinney's performance as a seen-it-all-before, gum-chewing field training officer injects some welcome dry humor into the drama. His character begrudgingly goes by the nickname Yoda, a nod to his duties transforming new recruits into capable crime fighters.
two or three wines for about 40 pesos, the most expensive tasting we encountered on our two trips. I bought a bottle of Angelica Zapata malbec 2006 for 180 pesos, about 25 percent less than what it costs in Brazil, which has high import taxes on wine. (Duty-free is still a better deal than the winery.)

Casino gambling was promoted in 1992 for the historic mining towns of Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek, with proceeds promised to historic preservation there and across the state. Since 1993, State Historical Fund competitive grants totaling $247 million have gone to 3,379 projects statewide, giving many towns a new life. Half went to government entities — towns, counties and the state. The Governor's Mansion received $709,591 over the past 11 years. More than $30 million went to the state Capitol. The legislature has decreed that approximately $17 million from the SHF will go to repair the Capitol dome. The Colorado Historical Society, administrator of the Historical Fund, gets $5 million a year until 2045, totaling $185 million, for its gorgeous new History Colorado Center, which opens in April. You don't have to be a purist to think that's not truly historic preservation.

"We've got to do much better than that," said Steve Nash, who made 5 of 7 shots. "I felt good about our team early. It just went downhill from there.

We have to play extremely hard, play together and play a lot smarter than we played tonight."

MSU will look to work the ball inside and get the ball to Draymond Green at various places on the court.

Shyne thinks the contradiction is in people's minds. "I learn and study as an Israelite but live in a world where we have to use guns. It's a tough world out there," he said while premiering two videos in a Jerusalem club this year. "I see soldiers with guns at the kotel — the Western Wall — every day." But he said weapons should be always be used in self-defense: "Better to be judged by 12 than carried by six."

One thing led to another, and the idea to continue the "Buffy" story in comics was launched. "I've learned so much about character-driven genre fiction from Joss," Allie says. "Every conflict, every plot point, every bit of drama really stems from who the main characters are. Joss has a phrase that he uses with his writers -- 'What's the Buffy of it?'" For example, if you've got a tale of a three-headed monster that comes to town, and Buffy fights it and kills it, Whedon's concern always is: "What makes it about Buffy?"

This chef buys pig's blood by the gallon  he needs it to make boudin noir, the famous French blood pork sausage that was the first dish I tried at AQ. I was blown away. It was edgy and forceful, but it also was elegant and finely realized. With its deep-red hue, the pork's flavor had great depth, yet the texture was impossibly tender and velvety. Set off with a foam that cut into the richness of the pork, the dish also included a small serving of Brussels sprouts, whose outer leaves had been peeled away to focus on the sweetness inside.

The sinner, self-avowed, is a former dolphin trainer, Ric O’Barry; he caught and trained the five dolphins who played the title role in the TV series “Flipper.” The series was so popular that it spawned a vogue in marine amusement parks, which turned dolphins into entertainers. (To an extent that “The Cove” never makes clear, the Taiji kill is a byproduct of efforts to catch dolphins that may be sold to such parks for as much as $150,000 per animal.) To atone for his own role in the fateful celebrity of smaller cetaceans, Mr. O’Barry became an eco-activist, freeing captive dolphins on many occasions.

But Apple has only released milestone announcements -- 500 million songs sold on July 18, 2005; one billion by February 23 of this year; 1.5 billion by September 12. In the company's earnings reports, iTunes sales are bunched together in a category called "other music related products and services." Mr. Munster, the Piper Jaffray analyst, assumes that 50% of that revenue is derived from iTunes. (An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the accuracy of that estimate.) By connecting the dots between milestone reports and his quarterly estimates of iTunes sales, and assuming a constant rate of sales in between, Mr. Munster arrives at his estimates for monthly sales.

For the better part of a year, Mitt Romney has tethered himself to an array of positions designed for the Republican presidential primaries, stances that put him to the right of where he's been through much of his career and raise questions about where he really wants to go.

It was not until a year later that I discovered who had gone to Michigan with Buddy, when I sat with Rosemarie; her husband, Bert, and five of their six adult children to do a follow-up story. Everyone I hoped to see that day was there except for Jimmy, the youngest. Cryptically, Rosemarie explained that “it would have been just too emotional for him to be here.” Rosemarie later confirmed to me (although not for publication at the time) that it was Jimmy who had gone to Michigan with Buddy. In the ensuing years, I would occasionally call Rosemarie just to talk — we had become friends. But I had become increasingly interested in Jimmy. I suspected that he was carrying an immense burden on his shoulders, even if he had just gone along with what Buddy had asked of him. I asked Rosemarie if Jimmy would like to talk with me. Always, she replied: “He is just not ready.”

PG&E inspected Line 109 in 2009 using a method that was incapable of finding flawed seam welds. Yet two stretches of the line have such welds, according to PG&E records. PG&E officials have said they had been intentionally boosting the pressure on lines with such welds every five years or so since 2003, but stopped the practice after the San Bruno explosion. The company says it had been elevating the pressure because federal regulations - based on peak pressure levels - would otherwise kick in and limit its ability to meet peak demand.

Now before I begin getting hate letters from happy residents of Glen Park, I want to say my point is not that Bernal Heights is a better place to live than any other place. The point here is that neighborhood pride is extremely high -- whether deservedly so or not, we have drunk the same Kool-Aid. And this neighborhood boosterism has helped drive prices beyond the norm. As attorney Rebecca Eisenberg -- who recently moved from Bernal Heights to Noe Valley -- put it: "I love Bernal, but now that I am gone, I recognize what a cult it is!"

3. Memo to Major League Baseball: You’ve got to do something about how you calculate blown saves. It’s a crime that Dolis got charged with a blown save on Thursday when he entered with a one-run lead, bases loaded and no outs, and then got a double-play grounder that allowed the tying run to score. There’s no way that should be held against him, not Marmol, who officially remained only 2-for-4 in save situations. The guy that creates the meltdown should bear the statistical blame. Why not do it this way? If a reliever enters in a save situation and leaves with runners on second or third base, who eventually score to tie the game, the pitcher who put them on base is charged with a blown save. Something’s got to change.
The sullen, withdrawn loner in my first-period class is, as usual, staring at nothing. I want to put my hand on his shoulder to remind him that he is one of us, not a passive observer.

If he put his hand on my arm and told me he didn't like my class, I'd feel angry and defensive.

For a time Saturday, McIlroy looked as if he might duplicate his course record performance. He birdied the first three holes and four of the first five to jump start his tournament.

As I've reminded throughout the years, the real story isn't about a holiday; it is about a holy day. It's about two people summoned from their home and forced to travel to register so the Roman occupiers could count them. The couple had no place to stay. One brief look, and the innkeeper announced there was no room at the inn. Their baby was born in the cold, in a working barn, set in a rough manger on a straw floor.

If the Broncos were to draft Martin in the first round, they definitely would need to draft a defensive tackle in the second round. Defensive tackle is their biggest position of need in this draft, but tailback isn't that far behind. Willis McGahee rushed for 1,199 yards and averaged 4.8 yards per carry last season, but he turns 31 on Oct. 21. And he is not a polished pass receiver, which the Broncos would like to have at tailback in their Peyton Manning-led offense.
The latest and ultimately greatest obstacle inside PNC Arena for the Terps in their 80-49 loss was very much an old one. As it authored another chapter in Maryland's decidedly undistinguished defensive history, Notre Dame turned a regional final showdown into a glorified layup line, with unimpeded trips to the rim coming almost as easy as its path to a second straight Final Four.

But mostly, the proponents don't talk about problems, and they certainly don't talk about the lack of standards for labeling or quality control. They talk about how great dispensaries will be. They talk about the jobs that will be created. They talk about the millions that will be generated by program taxes and fees.

A: No. What's causing these injuries? Number one, it's unavoidable. These guys are bigger, stronger, faster than ever. They train all year. Number two, the equipment.

We had reached Millau, home of the Viaduct, completed in 2004 and one of the world's tallest bridges. It towers high above the Tarn Valley. It's as graceful a vision as the paragliders who float above the two steep limestone plateaus it connects — the Causse Noir and Causse du Larzac.

The Lakers have now won 12 of their last 13 games, and their only loss since the all-star break was a nail biter at Miami.

Where was I? Oh, yes: the world's all-time coldest wind chill. That's what you're going to be feeling at this point in an Obama second term. If you like his contempt for judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and representative democracy now, wait'll you see how "flexible" he'll get starting in January 2013. The CFPB appointment is not a small thing. Indeed, its new director, one Richard Cordray, embodies what's gone so disastrously wrong with American government: you'll have to be in compliance with him, but he doesn't have to be in compliance with anybody, whether the Senate or the Constitution. As I say somewhere in my recent book, you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life. More and more aspects of the citizen's daily existence are regulated by rules and officials both of which are ever more disconnected from any meaningful accountability to the people's representatives. As the president says, look for even more "flexibility" in a second term: more non-recess recess appointments, more executive orders, more bewildering innovations from the commissars of the hyper-regulatory state.

If I were a player, it would drive me crazy. It would keep me up at night. But the professional mindset doesn't allow that.

"To see Major League Baseball react to the situation in the manner in which it did, it just fortifies the importance of the professionalism and integrity of the game."
But even at more affordable state colleges, students feel the pinch. Andy Tran said it's harder to qualify for financial aid. Some students take out multiple loans. He's not getting any assistance.

In the end, the restaurant comes off as amateurish and not ready for prime time. I'm not expecting three-star service. But is it too much to ask for a little common sense? Or thoughtfulness? I'd love to get a cease-and-desist order to prevent servers from continually checking in to ask if everything is "great." And the $30 corkage fee for a restaurant with such a weak wine list isn't the swiftest move either.

Yes, Portland is experiencing a budget crisis. But because Americans have notoriously short memories, we should remember just how we got into this budget crisis in the first place. It wasn't because public workers' wages were too high, pensions too generous, or health care plans too expensive.

But ships move through canals in both directions, and so the impact of a new set of locks in Panama cannot be measured solely in terms of lost cargo. Just as the expanded canal will enable more all-water trade between Shanghai and Savannah, Ga., California ports could expect to benefit from an increase in the volume of goods arriving by sea from Europe, Africa and South America. In one local example, the Port of West Sacramento's new harbor crane, which arrived earlier this month, transited the Panama Canal en route from its European manufacturer.

Maybe a rec-league coach could have won a title with six likely NBA Draft picks in the lineup, including two projected to go in the top three. But Calipari deserves credit for getting this group to put their egos aside for the benefit of the team. In a sport dominate by the AAU culture, that doesn’t happen often.
O'Brien fielded questions from a 3,000-plus packed auditorium of students, faculty and alumni, where the Dalai Lama had enlightened audiences just a few days prior. A select group of 200 student leaders had the opportunity to meet with O'Brien before the show, offering a variety of gifts (Conan cookies, paintings, even a resume) and lingering hugs. Here, he expressed his thrill to be on the La Jolla campus: "One of my favorite things to do is to talk to students, who I'll probably be working for in a few years."

Athens, epicenter of the Greek financial crisis, offers particular bargain-hunting opportunities. Hotel prices are down 22%, crowds should be smaller and businesses are particularly hungry for tourist euros.

But when the game beckoned for a hero, it was the rookie point guard who always answered the Bat Signal. Statistical gurus will use numbers to say Irving was among the league's most clutch players.

It's brunch time on Saturday at the Peninsula Tokyo, and a line of dark-suited men and kimono-clad women suddenly assemble inside the hotel's entrance. Moments later an ancient Rolls-Royce pulls up front and a bride dressed in a extravagantly decorated Shinto wedding dress climbs out and steps slowly through the lobby, carefully balanced on her wooden zori. At the end of the receiving line stands Malcolm Thompson, the hotel's general manager, who bows and then claps with the wedding guests. Flanking the British-born Thompson are a couple of elegantly attired Japanese men who look like boardroom presidents but spend their days in the lobby greeting guests. "We realized early on," Thompson says, "that some Japanese guests felt intimidated if everyone working at the hotel was much younger than them, so we hired older gentlemen to make them feel at home."

that this year's field is wide open. Very difficult for me to handicap. There are 15 modern-day candidates and a maximum of five will make it. (The two Senior Committee nominees are voted on separately.) Back to the moderns: I think Aeneas Williams (Cardinals, Rams) has a shot but I don't have any real sense of how much support he'll have. There's a big push being made for former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. If selected, DeBartolo would go in as a contributor. I believe it's important to honor contributors -- non players -- but I don't like players and contributors being placed on the same ballot. I don't like having to choose between, say, Willie Roaf and a team owner or coach. It isn't fair to either side. I'd like to see our friends at the Pro Football Hall of Fame change this and put the contributors in a different category.

It has been more than two years since McKee, a construction magnate who built WingHaven in O'Fallon, unveiled his $8.1 billion plan to redevelop two square miles of the near north side into office buildings, warehouses and thousands of new homes.

When Bon Jovi received a nomination last year, detractors argued that the popular Jersey group lacked the artistic merit required for enshrinement. Supporters reminded us how few groups were still capable of filling stadiums — something Bon Jovi does with ease.

It may not have been a deliberate rebuke, but to Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates, it must have felt like one.

Fortunately, a Texas judge recently wrote an opinion that provides pertinent clarity about the tension between judging and majoritarianism. The Texas Supreme Court, on which Don Willett sits, struck down a law for violating the Texas Constitution's prohibition of retroactive laws. The law immunized one company from a pending lawsuit by a man dying of asbestos exposure. The question was: Should the court blindly defer to the legislature's judgment that its police power -- its general authority to protect the public welfare -- trumped the constitutional ban on retroactive legislation?
