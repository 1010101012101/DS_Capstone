Ronnie Van Zant put it best at the end of "Free Bird":
The format feels familiar at first, because we've seen countless bands profiled through their rise, fall and struggles to remain relevant on the old VH1 show "Behind the Music." But Anderson and Metzler break through that show's often-shallow approach, with the band offering incredible access to its creative process and, perhaps more surprisingly, its members problems, both personal and professional. It's a refreshing approach; the warts-and-more-warts style somehow makes the film ultimately more uplifting.

BRAZIL: Brazilian soccer is known as “the beautiful game” because of its effortless mix of technical ability and innate sense of style. This concept is also a musical one. Antônio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto (with help from others) fused traditional samba and jazz, creating bossa nova.

Last fall Sotheby's and Christie's International auctions for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art did well, a major improvement over comparable May auctions, although not as well as fall 2008. That seemed to indicate that though things are improving, they won't soon be returning to the dizzying heights of the art market boom, partly fueled by newly minted millionaires from places like Russia and China.

After visitors experience their own harvest at the institute, Ward hopes they will go home and start growing some of their own vegetables and herbs. Introducing new ways to educate is the Farm and Garden's way of reaching the largest possible audience.

The exhibits inside the museum are a timeline of the civil rights movement. Visitors can walk through a Birmingham city bus in use at the time that Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. Newspaper headlines and black-and-white television news reports paint a picture of unease, chaos, change.

French onion soup is hard for me to pass up when it's on a menu. There's really no such thing as a bad French onion soup  you're pretty much guaranteed some kind of success simply by melting cheese, cooking the onions until they're limp and velvety, and heating the broth. But the flavor profile of this popular soup is wide-ranging, from robust and beefy to mild and sweet. This version landed on the sweet side, reminding me of the French onion soup Matt Woolston sometimes serves at the Supper Club.

As the goalkeepers wandered out for warm-ups, the crowd erupted and I witnessed the phenomenon that is Hope Solo. She’s an extremely talented goalkeeper and athlete, and her smile was contagious as she high fived some waiting fans as she ran out to complete pre-game drills. The crowd yelled messages of encouragement. Ok, they yelled a lot, and the screams varied from actual words to just extremely high pitched wails. Solo did her best to keep on task, waiving to the crowd at points while going through her pre-match drills. The noise got more deafening as the full teams moved out for pre-match drills. I heard plenty of yells of “We love you” with the player’s name at the end to just about everyone, while the signs of support were now scattered throughout the park. As the crowd started to fill in, the noise became more apparent but instead of the usual crescendo of chants for the Timbers, the atmosphere felt more appropriate for a popular band.
He takes us downstairs, where workers are finishing construction on Ginny's Supper Club (the room has just opened for business). The sleekly designed space will host different kinds of music - jazz and Latin, for example. Only this one, Samuelsson notes, "will have really good food."

Sometimes it’s because the cultural gulf between the lovers is just too wide.

France is a traditionally Catholic country where church and state were formally separated more than a century ago, when Muslims were barely a presence.

There are a host of reasons for these cost controls. Large banks face declining revenue from a federal law reducing swipe fees that are charged each time you use a bank debit card.

The interest they can charge on loans is low.

But a plan won't prevent another major flood from occurring or protect people whose lives would be at risk if it did. Only repairs to the levees can do that. Parts of the Metro East flood-control system date back to the 1930s. River water is seeping underneath the levees. Old pumps and drainage tiles must be replaced. Making those repairs could cost as much as $180 million. But 65 percent of the cost eventually could be recovered if Congress appropriates funds to pay for the work - as it should.

One popular gerontology program sensitizes workers to dealing with older customers. Trainees wear blurry glasses to experience what the vision-impaired deal with in reading forms; they don earplugs so they can empathize when customers are confused in phone conversations if the speaker doesn't enunciate. The class includes grief counseling, as employees handling claims often deal with people who have just lost loved ones.
Back in 2009, with seniors Tim Tebow, Ryan Stamper, Riley Cooper, Brandon Spikes all preparing to play in their final collegiate game, Meyer stole every headline and all the media attention from that year’s Sugar Bowl by retiring, then un-retiring, then nobly mustering up enough energy to coach the Gators to a 51-24 win over Cincinnati.

Was the act of pulling away from mainstream American culture too hard on the traditional family unit? Melissa, who loved her childhood and her parents, doesn't have the answers. But her memoir is an important piece of the puzzle. Today we both admire and ridicule such attempts at countercultures. The Colemans and the Nearings were not hippies or druggies or even, for the most part, political protesters. They worked hard to create an alternative economy that still exists and is growing in rural America. This memoir is evidence of their great sacrifices.

That’s because they no longer know Smith as a “game manager,” a label stuck to the former No. 1 overall pick when no one distinguished trait emerged in his five snake- bitten seasons before this one. And although football lore could ultimately leave him stamped a quarterback with no big-play ability, Smith has been doing his best to change that perception amid this unforeseen run to the conference title game.
In 2006, partway through her junior year in college, Zagunis put on hold her education at Notre Dame to devote herself to the 2008 games. She moved back to the Portland area to work daily with women's saber coach Ed Korfanty, Oregon Fencing Alliance fencing master -- and Ward.

James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, said as much last week in explaining his relatively optimistic take on the job market. "It's true 2010 and 2011 were disappointing years because of special circumstances, but that doesn't mean 2012 is going to be a special year," he said. "I think the most likely outcome is for sustained growth and a further decline in unemployment."

Gans said that it was too early to conclude whether the law affected immigrants' ability to get jobs. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, 2008, was implemented as the recession was beginning. It will take further research to determine how much of an effect the law had on immigrant unemployment and how much simply was due to the recession, she said.

"I was eager to work with the guy. He's so affable, and everyone who's met him just thinks the world of him," Payne said. "He was perfect for the part. He wasn't perfect for Jack in 'Sideways.'

And, boy, was I lucky."

The city's public transit system carries about 5 million passengers on an average weekday, and the entire system has never before been halted because of a natural disaster. It was seriously hobbled by an August 2007 rainstorm that disabled or delayed every one of the city's subway lines. And it was shut down after the 9/11 attacks and during a 2005 strike.

In some of the country's most ambitious dog houses, meat has strayed to the unusual — rabbit and duck and heritage pig, topped variously with chutneys and aiolis and other exotica. Jason Fernandez, owner of the 6-month-old Hot Willy's Sausage and Italian Beef Superstore in Ybor City, has kept his vision more on terra firma. That didn't stop the Wall Street Journal from including the newcomer recently in a best-hot dog roundup. Opened at the beginning of the year, the casual stand has a number of things going for it.
Luck makes few mistakes and works constantly to improve. Tall and strong, he has the size to take a hit and is not afraid to stand in the pocket and make a throw with pass rushers bearing down on him. While lacking the exceptional athleticism of Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III, Luck is a deceptively mobile QB who rushed for 957 yards in his college career, and he can make throws and accurate reads while on the run. The scouting combine only confirmed his standing as the top player available in the draft. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.67 seconds - fourth among quarterbacks - and finished first in the broad jump (10 feet, 4 inches), third in the three-cone drill (6.80 seconds) and fifth in the 20-yard shuttle (4.28) at his position. He earned an overall grade of 97.0 on a scale with a maximum of 100. Luck has no clear weaknesses and could be a once-in-a-generation talent, and he'll likely start right away for the team that selects him.

Think big. "With one child, it's very simple to pick up their dishes from the table and put them in the dishwasher and pick up their laundry and do their homework with them," Newman says. "But your child needs responsibilities. Before you do something for your child, ask yourself, 'Would I be doing this if I had two or three or four kids?' Because you're doing your child a disservice if you don't let him have any responsibilities."

Wall Street is expecting the Labor Department tomorrow to announce seasonally adjusted job growth of 200,000 for March, which would be down from 230,000 in February.
Previous reports have suggested that amnesty would be handled as a "stretch exception" -- one that would let teams waive a player, but stretch his salary cap hit over double the length of the remainder of the deal, plus one year. So if a player is owed $12 million over two seasons, he could be waived, and although he would still have to be paid, his cap hit could be stretched to five years at $2.4 million each year.

For his off-Broadway debut, he’s upped all the antes. Over the course of nearly three hours, “Burning” and its cast of 13 leap back and forth between New York and Berlin, the early 1980s and the present.

Nearly half of Rock City's attendance is repeat business, much of it generational. Donna Thomas of Cleveland, Tenn., said she first visited Rock City when she was 8 or 9 years old. "Later I took my own children there so they could see seven states at once," she said. Now her daughter has her own memories of the site because her husband proposed to her there.
For Menard, the win lifted him five spots in the standings to 14th, putting him in contention for a wild card into the 12-driver Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. The final two spots in the field will go to drivers ranked 11th or lower who have the most victories. The two currently in position? Menard and Denny Hamlin, who is 11th in the points.
SDS President Jason Spadaro said the project was not currently feasible. Uncertainty over the renewal of the federal production tax credit, which expires at the end of 2012, means few new wind projects are going forward. California's new limits on renewable power imports have also slowed development in the Northwest. Finally, Spadaro said the state's decision to scale back the project undermined its economics.

THE ROUTINE: "I bolt the door to the room, and if there's an adjoining room, I check the door to make sure that room is locked. I cannot tell you how many times people have walked in on me.

Then I open up the ironing board, I make sure it's functional, I look to see that there's no water in the iron and I put it in a corner of my room so it's ready to use. And then I unpack. ... I have a plastic liner from the drycleaners and I put that in the drawer first."

Peters averaged 11.8 points and 9.3 rebounds for the NCAA runners-up as a senior. Making those statistics more impressive is that she played only 24.2 minutes per game -- the least of any Notre Dame starter. That's largely because she was the team leader in fouls, with 102, but only fouled out three times.
Cherry Hill attorney Walter Kawalec III, who represented the school district and Klug also declined comment, stating he had not been authorized by his clients to speak about the case.
I have a remarkable talent for inventing reasons to pull the covers over my head and go back to sleep. Doug remarks on this often. Likewise, I can make nearly anything so complicated, even I decide it's too much trouble to bother with.

More coverage: The Internet buzzed after Kate Middleton and the fictional Bella Swan (in the "Twilight" movie) wore wedding gowns with long sleeves. Would strapless gowns topple from their perch? Not exactly. "You put a sleeve in the gown and to get a beautiful fit you need a tight armhole, and that really eliminates movement," Durham said. "I've seen brides spin their arms around like a propeller when they're dancing. Sleeves hinder that." Kate's example is being felt, however. Cap sleeves are gaining popularity, as are illusion necklines, as in a strapless dress with a sheer overlay that rises to a boat neck. Longer veils are back, too. More than three in every four women in a David's Bridal survey conducted last fall planned to wear a veil. Many brides are wearing their hair partially down with a veil, as did Middleton, for a modern twist.

I can vouch for Pukalani Falls. My husband and I renewed our vows for our 10th anniversary. Lovely! They also let us bring in the minister who originally married us. Just be prepared that if you want a morning wedding, you have to be there before sunrise or the morning sun will wash everything out in the photos. If you're not an early riser, go for the afternoon/evening wedding.
Patsos is nothing if not a liberal user of his bench players. When I go to Reitz, I try to sit behind the home bench, which affords me the opportunity to see the coach at work. For Patsos, at work means quickly yanking players out of the game, yelling at an assistant coach about said player’s performance while the player sits next to the assistant coach, then putting the player back in a minute later. During one early-season game, he subbed out all five starters within the first two minutes of the game, only to put them all back in a few plays later. That said …

In Oak Grove, the question on everyone's mind is "Who approved closing our library, and why didn't we know about it until now?" The easy answer is that in 2008 the county commissioners, led by Lynn Peterson, decided to abandon the library in Oak Grove because the community is not an incorporated city. When the voters approved a tax increase to support the new library district, few were aware that Oak Grove was once again being ignored.

In a sense, she wasn't kidding. Emotion may still be a ways off, but through her work as a social roboticist, Ms. Knight is teaching robots like Data how to read, replicate and respond to human social cues—first on stage but, ultimately, in real life. Robots are everywhere, she said, but the scope of what they can do has been largely limited to "the three D's"—dirty, dangerous and dull. The way Ms. Knight sees it, a robot could help someone make friends, communicate with a doctor or assimilate to a new place if it knew the kinds of gestures and language that make people feel at ease.

The experience: After the ice melted, my hostess dedicated all her attention to me, encouraging me to relax outside in the cheerful garden beneath the trees and a Tang-colored umbrella at a wood bistro table. She sat with me, explaining the vineyards that flourish just steps away - some scraggly, some meticulous in various stages of pruning - and the agricultural character of the property. It was clear she enjoyed her work, describing each wine as poetry in between slipping away long enough here-and-there to let me savor privately.

The point, he said, is to curb the federal government's appetite for debt gradually, so it won't have to take drastic steps later.

"I think I've gotten maybe a little freer playing the piece. When I first learned it when I was about 21, I played it much more from the standpoint of a classical pianist. One of the things I've realized is, ‘Rhapsody in Blue' - unlike the traditional one cadenza that so many concertos have - has a whole bunch of them. There are several extended segments where the piano plays solo, and that allows you a certain degree of freedom."

In his televised address to Congress, Obama sought to provide a jolt for the economy, still staggering on his watch, and for his own standing at one of the lowest marks of his presidency. He put forth a jobs plan that he hopes can get bipartisan support and spur hiring in a nation where 14 million people remain out of work and the jobless rate is stuck at 9.1 percent. Public confidence in his stewardship of the economy is eroding.

As you read Nostrana's menu --a collaboration between Whims and talented co-chef Deb Accuardi --a few things are clear. Ingredients are beautifully sourced, and little touches are special --homemade fruit mustarda to accompany fine cured meats, or raisin-pocked onion relish to pile on earthy rabbit crostini. About one-third of the menu changes every day, keeping palates and ideas fresh.

"We were hoping to inspire Americans to commit to taking one 'combat shower' a week, until all the troops come home, so for those 3 minutes in the shower, they can connect to and share in the sacrifice of our armed forces," Hale wrote. "I've heard many soldiers say that things are very different from WWII, where the war seemed to affect every family. ... I've not seen any kind of 'poor me' attitude ... I think in part because this is an all volunteer Army ... but I do get the sense that soldiers feel like most Americans have no idea of the burden that our armed forces and their families have carried this past decade."

"Each season of 'Buffy' was about introducing a new Big Bad, then assembling the team needed to defeat the villain and testing that team's integrity, putting personal pressure on each of them in an effort to find their weaknesses," McWeeny says.

"We have been committed to Weaver. We have donated money to the school and volunteered," said Kristen Lockridge, a parent from Long Beach of two students who had planed on enrolling her younger child in kindergarten at Weaver next fall. "We have built our life around Weaver. We are just asking that families already attending Weaver aren't split up, with children having to go to different schools."
Under the 1st Amendment, they add, any ambiguity should be resolved in her favor. This would be a harder case to make to the court if Stewart had been openly contemptuous of her conviction or if she had said she would violate the law in the future; the judicial system long has taken remorse (or its absence) into account when it comes to sentencing. But her actual comments don't justify a quadrupling of her sentence. The appeals court needs to make sure that the harsher punishment wasn't a reaction to Stewart's assertiveness or her ideological identification with her client.
Aquino would not name the specifics of the contract still under discussion. The contract, like Foose's appointment, will be approved with an official board vote and be made public.

The Cardinals' early work against Reds starter Homer Bailey proved enough. It came three days after they reached Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Yovani Gallardo for four home runs, including three in the third inning of a blowout win.
The giant Kenersys turbine also is proof that at least one Cleveland corporation is willing to put up money to help. Lincoln, a global manufacturer of welding equipment, is financing about $4.5 million of the $5.9 million project because it sees the purchase as a smart investment and a way to help the region.
The cottages have free, high-speed Wi-Fi Internet access, but other than that communication with the outside world was a little tricky.

1. If you're already overweight, you're better off working on your health than obsessing about your weight. A 2005 study showed that women in a "Health at Every Size" program lowered their blood pressure and cholesterol for two years while women in a weight-loss program lost little but their self-esteem in the same period. We should all -- fat, skinny and in between -- eat healthier and exercise more.
Team officials had said they hoped to draft a wide receiver, and Streeter is a tall vertical target who may help them expand their downfield passing attack. A hair under 6-foot-5, Streeter has excellent straight-ahead speed for his size. At the scouting combine, he ran the 40-yard dash at 4.40 seconds. But his route-running, catching, and other areas of his game could use polishing.

Maxwell said that communication between the school system and county government must improve for more collaborative efforts in crafting the budget.

Huhn said radar data shows the plane flew southeast in a straight line from Falcon Field at an elevation of 4,500 feet.
The track's dwindling purses have made it difficult just to break even during its summer racing season, even with a winning horse. That has caused many breeders to cut back or get out of the business. Because Canterbury relies heavily on state-bred horses to fill its races, it faces the prospect of having too few horses in the coming years to run a viable racing season.
The Cavaliers (12-17) called time and set up a play for Irving, who had a subpar second half. He finished the night 8-of-21 from the field with 23 points, four turnovers and only one assist. But there was little question who would attempt the last shot. Irving in-bounded the ball to Jamison, who gave it back to the 19-year-old around the 3-point arc. The rookie drove to the basket and was fouled by Tyreke Evans before he came close to attempting a shot.

"Our approach against Moyer was just to try to see something over the plate and be aggressive, but not so aggressive on stuff that's falling off the edge of the plate," Dodgers right fielder Andre Ethier said. "There's a lot of movement on some of the pitches he's throwing, so you're going to swing and miss sometimes. But you've got to keep taking your hacks and not be discouraged if you're swinging through some of those pitches or even strike out."

The U.S. has been leery of foreign control of U.S. energy companies in the past.

CNOOC Ltd. had outbid Chevron Corp. by about $1.5 billion for Unocal.

The original 2006 film “Happy Feet” was about a misfit penguin who, instead of having his breed’s gift of song, had a special step. It was a bizarre idea for a film, but gifted with a good vocal cast and some lingering affection for “March of the Penguins,” it became a surprise hit. This beautifully animated but uninvolving sequel has the same old flock of dancing penguins face new perils and the arrival of a mysterious puffin. Things spring to life whenever old vocal pros like Robin Williams and Hank Azaria get a scene. But like its heroes, the movie remains leaden-footed and flightless.

The organizations often back the company's priorities.

Considering that Paul Schurick faced as much as 12 years in prison for his role in a 2010 election day robocall that fraudulently urged voters to stay home from the polls, the sentence handed down today to former Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.'s 2010 campaign manager may sound a bit light. Mr. Schurick will serve no jail time and pay no fine. He was sentenced to 30 days of home detention, four years of probation and 500 hours of community service. And he shamefully continued to insist on the courthouse steps after the sentence that a clear attempt to suppress black votes was actually a "counterintuitive" effort to turn out African-American supporters of Mr. Ehrlich. But that is not to say that the former political operative's conviction and sentence were insignificant, or that some good can't come from this sorry episode.

The solution: Nick Sekscenski, a certified personal trainer at the Merritt Athletic Club on Fort Avenue in Locust Point, says supplementing your workout with strength training is a necessary addition to any fitness plan. "The more muscle you have on your body, the more calories you're going to burn while resting," he says. Lifting weights might not burn as many calories as jogging a few miles, but it will increase your metabolism for a longer stretch of time, he says. Sekscenski points out that building muscle does not require bulking up — simply lifting light weights and adding lean muscle mass will do the trick.
