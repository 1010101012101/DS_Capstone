The Nets likely need Wallace to retain any hope of keeping point guard Deron Williams, who has said he will opt out of his '12-13 option and become an unrestricted free agent. Wallace also surely realizes that with his numbers down significantly this season, he might be hard-pressed to get a contract that will pay him $11 million if he chooses to opt out, and he might be better served to remain with the Nets.
Bonamici pointedly noted that the Democratic committee was operating independently of her campaign -- and she was winning a strong 54 percent of the vote. Instead, the 6 percent that went to Libertarian James Foster and Steven Reynolds of the Progressive Party seemed more damaging to Cornilles, who was getting just over 39 percent of the vote.

Some of the last words she said to me on her deathbed were, "I don't think I was a very good mother." At that instant, I saw that she had known all along of her shortcomings.

I then walked over to my wife's PC, which doesn't have Google Drive software installed, and accessed the file by logging into the Google Drive website. I was immediately able to read the file.

Either way, I had immediate access to the file but the process was far from seamless because now I had two files -- the original Word file and the Google document that I had just edited.

Personal Safety: The No.1 concern for anyone clearing land is personal safety. From small nicks and cuts to gaping wounds and sprains, clearing land is not only physical, but can involve the use of dangerous equipment. Always wear eye and ear protection when using weed eaters, chainsaws and chippers. Ankle-high boots, thick pants, long-sleeved shirts and gloves should be worn like a uniform. And taking regular, hydrating breaks will keep the likelihood of injury low.

Hey, Tony: I was not a Eric Mangini fan but I can say without a question the team was better prepared on game day. The team is putting Colt at a disadvantage and he will never make it the whole season. We give a team 14 points on special teams? You've got to be kidding me. At this point do you feel the only other opportunity for a win will be against the Rams? Do you think 3-13 is the best they can do? They are regressing each week. -- Joe Maloney, Woodland, Calif.

These officials told chairman Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak and fellow committee members the program is to prevent job losses by giving companies an alternative to having their operating licenses revoked.
City Council members and others invested in the status quo will assert that a poor area must be paired with a rich one to get noticed, or that there is some crucial historical link between, say, USC and Westchester 20 miles to the west that require them to be in the same council district. Nonsense. Those arguments are merely evidence that incumbents have figured out how to make Los Angeles' odd shape work to their advantage. They are not evidence that Los Angeles' political structure is working to the advantage of its people.

"His whole body of work is one long memoir," Dickstein said. "He is not the same as William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and so many Southern writers who give us extreme characters and explosive situations.

"I tell you what: I think it's kind of good," Kubiak said. "We need to get back on the field and play a lot better than we did last week. It's a tough turnaround physically, but mentally, probably the best thing we can do is go play another game here real quick."
They were only a few hours away from the night they'd anxiously awaited, carefully plotted out and were finally on the verge of executing.

After stabilizing the military situation in Afghanistan with a surge of 33,000 troops in late 2009, Obama is now withdrawing forces, and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has expressed hope that the U.S. combat role in the country will end in 2013, a year earlier than NATO originally estimated. Meanwhile, the U.S. is gingerly exploring the possibility of a political solution in Afghanistan while reorienting its anti-terror strategy to targeted attacks on individuals. Someday — sooner rather than later, we hope — U.S. troops will be gone and there will be less of an opportunity for clashes of culture like the conflict over the burning of the Koran.
Findings about Imagine's St. Louis real estate and contractor dealings in recent days are 'serious" and "need to be investigated." Chapman said.
As for the "safeguards" in this bill, the only thing really required to be eligible for this benefit is to have been breaking the law for at least three years. The requirement that they sign an affidavit pledging to apply for permanent residency is meaningless unless we grant another amnesty.

Then, too, more assertive US leadership could have wound up this tragedy months ago, at a lower cost in dollars and lives -- and America would have had more opportunity to shape the post-Khadafy regime.

The effects of the revolving-door syndrome reverberate through the ranks. Legislators don't have time to get to know the issues in depth, and feel the demand to raise money to campaign for a new office once they are termed out. Each effect plays into the hands of special interests that possess the knowledge the politicians lack and the contributions they desire. Neither contributes to long-term thinking about the major challenges facing the state.
Jim Tierney, president of the American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees Local 2384, said officials should use the study to strike a balance between attracting and maintaining quality employees while saving money for Phoenix.

"It's very hard to find all those fees in in one place," said Susan Weinstock, director of the Safe Checking Project at Pew. "Right now, you find out about them in two ways. Either when you go to the bank and ask about them, or you find out after the fact when you incur it."

Her defense attorney, however, portrays her as a suburban housewife with a techie side to her and a goal to launch a more sophisticated version of match.com. Her case is very similar to the one depicted in racy newsstand ads around Manhattan, showing a scantily dressed Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of a suburban housewife who banks on prostitution.

I still struggled with the question of what Foursquare offers beyond its novelty.
Stewart came to Orlando, Fla., this past week to attend the 45th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off, which she taped for her TV show. (I still can't believe that a Pennsylvania woman won a million dollars for pumpkin ravioli.) While in town, she also swung by a local Macy's to judge the firefighters' chili cook off, which I attended, and to introduce her new line of cast-iron cookware. Between judging the chili and signing recipes, she granted one, and only one, media interview during her visit. I scored it -- five minutes with Martha.

If I roll up a painting and put it away, it's fair game for reworking completely. ... The one thing I can control is what happens in the studio. Trucks wait outside, deadlines don't get made, I promise 14 paintings and there are six. But once something's done, it becomes part of many histories, and I don't control that.

The song they performed on the January show, a slinky bit of minor-key dance-pop called "The Boys," owed an obvious debt to Kelis' catcalling hit "Milkshake." The band's gently lascivious choreography underscored the track's sex-appeal boasts: lead singer Kim Taeyeon made come-hither hand gestures while her bandmates pulled PG-13 versions of Lady Gaga's alien body bends.

Yet for everything Benu has to offer, it's an experience that might not appeal to everyone. One reader wrote me after a recent dinner, saying it was "a rip-off. One needed a magnifying glass to see what was on the plates. Actually, no flowers, no candles, waiters dressed as monks. We knew we were in trouble when the waiter himself warned us about the food portions PRIOR to ordering!"

If Romney does win, he might hope that he scores better than 24 percent -- his standing in the final pre-caucus poll by the Des Moines Register. For pundits in search of meaning might note that 24 percent would be the lowest percentage for any winner, even lower than Dole's 26 percent and Jimmy Carter's 27.6 percent in 1976. (Carter actually finished second to "uncommitted" that year, but his star was born.)

California at the time was somewhat of a Republican bastion, so the 1962 defeat stung. Rebounding from the losses, the Lincoln Club helped engineer some success for the GOP. Not only was the club active in supporting Nixon's successful 1968 presidential run, it backed Ronald Reagan in both his winning 1966 gubernatorial campaign and later presidential races.

It brings us the dark underbelly of children's television, taking us behind the scenes of a contest to find the newest puppeteer for popular kids' show "Sunflower Hour."

There is a warmed egg yolk on a spoon, injected with a dense broth, that explodes with the flavor of black truffles; braised oxtail contained in a cube constructed from paper-thin wafers of grilled bread; and a garden of tiny vegetables—Atxa's version of the Modernist classic gargouillou—planted in a raised bed of dark-black beetroot soil.

And how that new maturity pushed him to reach for a record that was not so much about youthful rebellion and “the never-ending now” but a “reckoning with the adult world” where tramps like us – well, baby, whatever we were born to do, now we were mostly just trudging off to our factory jobs, and trying to hold our families together.

The Meteorlight K-9 led dog ball was by far my favorite (as it was Dean’s). After losing countless balls inthe dark, this one was almost impossible to lose! We tried the disco version that appears to glow in all the colors of the rainbow. The ball is also mouth friendly not like other hard plastic lighted balls that we’ve tried. The on/off button is a bit tricky but the LED light has never turned off after long throws and hard bounces. At $12, I would buy a dozen of the Meteorlights to use during the winter!
The filmmakers, most of who have never worked with puppets, let alone The Muppets, closely collaborated with the puppeteers who have been portraying these characters for years.

Please, I am not seeking to denigrate Native American cultures. My concern is religion. The 2001 edition of the World Christian Encyclopedia estimates 10,000 distinct religions worldwide. Any one of these may have multiple variants — what we call denomi nations; there are 33,000 for Christianity alone. All have beliefs that may be whatever they may be, each as true as any other (unless maybe Justice Scalia would vet the "irrational" ones for us). And many — in the U.S., at any rate — with believers prepared to assert a right to act on their quite sincere beliefs. Could me, myself and I become a religion? Why not?

Woodson said he'll switch Anthony over to power forward, where he scored 29.8 points per game in April when Stoudemire was dealing with a back injury. From there Woodson can either put J.R. Smith in at shooting guard and Landry Fields or Steve Novak at small forward, or he could put in Fields at shooting guard and Novak at small forward while leaving Smith as the sixth man. Fields started for Shumpert in Game 2, but with Stoudemire out of the lineup, Woodson might want more scoring and that gives Smith the upper hand.

"Important from Washington!" said the "Telegrpahic News" (sic) on the front page Sept. 23, 1862. "Proclamation by the President." Two subsidiary headlines spelled out the details: "Slaves in States in Rebellion to be Free After Jan. 1st, 1862" (sic) and "No more slaves to be returned by military officers." Those headlines had to tell the story, because the text that followed was simply the Emancipation Proclamation, in full.

The offseason's major acquisition, outfielder Carlos Quentin, probably is out for April following knee surgery and his is one sorely needed bat.

øMinnesota, for instance, hired Jerry Kill under an offer letter dated Dec. 5, 2010. He and Minnesota officials didn't finish signing the full employment agreement until Oct. 24.

The flop came 5c 3s 2h, giving Juttelstad the nuts but also giving Gagne an alluring open-ended straight draw, which caused her to make one of her first aggressive plays and lead out for $300,000 -- an unnecessarily large bet into a pot containing a little more than half that.

So far, he has hired six dancers and will dance himself).

The novel mutual fund-ETF hybrid structure grew out of a patent that Vanguard secured before it sought regulators' permission in June to introduce the soon-to-be-launched products.
Less ideally and more realistically would be a replay of Smoot-Hawley, just when the wobbly world economy doesn't need a fight between its two largest members. Economic nationalism, once unleashed here and there, might prove hard to control. But there's a big difference between then and now. Smoot-Hawley was blatantly protectionist. Dozens of tariffs increased; many countries retaliated. By contrast, American action today would aim at curbing Chinese protectionism.

George Barisich, a shrimper from St. Bernard Parish, La., hadn't seen an Asian tiger shrimp in more than a decade. Last year, he brought up two in his nets. To an industry still reeling from the effects of the 2010 BP oil spill, the sightings are causing renewed distress, he says.
TORONTO — Ben Uzoh had 12 points, a career-high 12 assists and 11 rebounds for his first career triple-double, and the Toronto Raptors routed New Jersey 98-67 in Thursday night's season finale, a loss that slightly improves the Nets' chances in the NBA draft lottery.

Subtlety is not always a hallmark of Palm Springs' gay community. But then, unlike in many towns, it doesn't have to be. As many as half of Palm Springs' 40,000-or-so adult residents are gay; it has become, some locals contend, the gayest city in America.
"If you can't do it in free agency, if you can't do it with trades, then you you need to do it with the people you have on your team right now," Adelman said about improving the team. "Do we do that?

Step Two: Be open. In 2007, the tech tax emerged, in part, because lawmakers worked fast and furious — and without careful consideration and sufficient public input. Too often, tax policy is influenced more by lobbyists representing deep-pocketed clients than the public interest. Sunshine is usually the best cure for such wheeler-dealing.

WASHINGTON -- Top House Republican leaders are weighing in on the competitive primaries in the two open U.S. House seats in east-central Indiana, according to recently filed disclosure reports.
The Broncos' right guard is coming along. He had a bothersome screw removed last week from his once mangled left ankle. Now he only has seven screws and a plate keeping it all together. A 73-game starter going back to 2007, Kuper should be lined up with the first-string offense around June 1.
When Maryland's legislative session ended in early April, legislators failed to pass an income tax increase that would pay for increased spending in the budget, possibly putting into effect a so-called "doomsday" budget that would result in hundreds of millions of dollars of cuts, including a $50 million cut to the University of Maryland system. O'Malley has indicated that he plans to call a special session by mid-May to avert that scenario. "The budget as it currently stands would do a lot of damage," he told reporters last week.
Because of how thin the position is, Smith should become a starter by the season opener. But he'll have to prove himself. After all, the last time the Vikings traded up to pick a safety they thought would come in and start, they ended up with Tyrell Johnson, a second-round pick in 2008.
