By this time, Fil was already heating up with rage and anger. We tried calling his mom all the way in Bangkok (since the tickets were supposedly for his mom), it rang but no answer. Fil eventually decided to go back to the main entrance and double check. I was actually afraid that Fil would start a fight already!
Q. Why is the Higgs particle so important?
O wait, did I tell you about…. uh….I guess there isn’t much to tell you people about. So I think I will end this babble and start a game or something to relax before going to sleep. I hear thunder outside so hopefully I will be able to sleep when I want to go to sleep. Wallflower seems to be sleeping through it all so that’s a good thing. And without the jokes: I am really worried about her sleepingpatern. Just don’t know what to do about it.
The largest consumer of kelp, however, has been Japan. The Japanese have incorporated kelp and seaweed into their diets for 1,500 years. During the seventh to ninth centuries, only the Japanese nobility consumed seaweed.
Yet Hong Kong-based newspaper Ming Pao reports that false marriage certificates may be easily obtained in Shenzhen, the city just across the border in Guangdong province. Genuine-looking fake documents can be bought for only 700 yuan (US$111), the newspaper said, and can often fool Hong Kong law enforcement. Some legislators worry that fake documentation will be used widely unless the territory’s health department conducts on-site verification.

“Witchdoctor” by Alvin & the Chipmunks – I know that in the classic days of “ohh eee ohh aah aah” AutoTune was only a dream of some future musical techie but speeding up the turntable is lots of fun whether you’re doing it yourself (I loved it when I was a kid!) or hearing it on a cartoon. It was like huffin’ helium without turning your brain cells to mush.

It is perhaps not so surprising. It is the words that contain and communicate the drama. And this is perhaps why hearing audio recordings of Shakespeare’s plays is so satisfying a way of experiencing them. And also the most convenient: it is very difficult to catch up on the plays in the theatre – even if one happens, as I do, to live within reasonable distance of theatres putting on these plays. Over some forty or so years, I have seen only sixteen of these plays on stage (although, admittedly, there are some I have seen several times, and many others that I have seen on screen – mainly in the variable, but at times quite wonderful, BBC Shakespeare series). Most of my experience with these plays have been through the printed page rather than through performance, and, while there are those who claim that these plays must be experienced in performance and only in performance, experiencing them on the printed page has proved so enriching over the years that I find it hard to think of reading these plays being in any way a lesser experience than watching them.

And so we are confronted with a film that not only exploits sensitive topics and subjects; it revels in them. And Jiang Wen paid the price for his genius. Although the film opened at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and ultimately won the Grand Prix (the second place prize behind the illustrious Golden Palm), it was banned in its native China by the Chinese Film Bureau. Both the Chinese censors and the Japanese producers balked at such ideas as showing Japanese soldiers killing Chinese civilians and Chinese people as backwards and gullible. Reportedly, the Chinese Film Bureau dispatched men to Cannes in an attempt to block its premiere and seize the film’s negative.
With regards to this, Edwards summarizes:
Thanks for stopping by today. Hope you like it.
Of course I understand that by nature God is long suffering and full of mercy, grace, and love. He knows I will fail everyday at trying to obey Him, just as we understand our children are not always obedient. But let me offer this; it is different to fall short and not always succeed in perfect obedience as compared to having a lackadaisical attitude towards my failures. The standard is clear. The command right out of the mouth of Jesus, himself, says this, “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” Matthew 5:48.
Okay, sorry, again, about the long post today. Hope you have a beautiful Monday. Thanks for stopping by and I'll see you back here tomorrow!
New Look? You like?! I was inspired by this Ladybug's new look (and attempted it, but was reminded of my computer literacy and impatience with anything computer related). I even fooled around with Wordpress but also realized I was in way over my head. Anyway! I love the new look, it's about time!

(No doubt when Cardinal Law dropped the ball in Boston in 2002 and the bigger picture of institutional abuse and cover up became apparent nationwide, John Paul II was eager to appoint a loyal soldier, Rigali, who may have owed JPII a Vatican favor or two or three (?), to keep a lid on the Krol/Bevilacqua abuse cover-ups in Philly. While John Paul II owed little to Bevilacqua, he owed his very papacy
Around the same time as First Utterance hit shelves (few as they were), singer/songwriter Scott Walker had begun to gain something of a cult audience thanks to his increasingly haunting take on baroque folk & pop with albums such as Scott 3 and Scott 4.

And then it struck me - anyone else would have thrown the body in the dumpster, but I went the extra mile and buried it where another animal wouldn't dig it up and leave the carcass for me to find tomorrow or the day later. And I didn't throw it away because you're not supposed dispose of dead animals in the dumpsters that our fair city has for us to use in the alleys. That I followed the rules or propriety, and did the right thing to do instead of the expedient thing, reminded me that I did the right thing. Had I still been in Shaker, I would have called for someone from the city to do it. Seriously, would my father or brothers ever been able to do this? Not just no, but Hell No!
The three unwinds in the story all bring to surface various themes and challenges Shusterman portrays through the novel. Connor is faced with dealing with his anger. How does an unwind who has been betrayed by his family and the entire world find a way to control his anger? Connor plays the game of emotions as he battles his inner anger and finds a way to cope with what has happened to him. Risa deals with the challenge of perfection. She has spent her entire life in the State Home where she became a pianist. Though accomplished, she did not meet the talent of those State Home orphans who are able to avoid unwinding. Eventually she finds that her talents grow and expand as soon as she is no longer under society’s label. Through Risa’s story Shusterman declares that we are all talented in our own ways but not always in the ways society wants us to be. Lev deals with the horror of realizing that everything he has grown up with and believed about God is smashed to pieces. Shusterman makes a huge statement about religion through Lev’s story and contribution. Ultimately Lev finds that he does not have to conform to society’s definition of God; he can believe in a God who doesn’t believe in unwinding.

There were several babies that crawled over to where I was standing, reaching up to me. I quickly grabbed two of them, one for each arm. A few minutes later, one of the Ugandan women that worked there yelled at me. “No! Put them down!” Confused and hurt, I promptly set them back down on the ground. Screaming and crying they looked up at me, again reaching up, wanting to be held. It was an awful feeling and I began to cry with them. I was able to hold myself together and choke back most of the tears but I felt so helpless. Later, one of the women told me that they don’t want the babies to rely on being held. So, I did as the “mamas” were doing and sat down on the ground. My lap was then swarmed like the beach at Normandy. I tried to interact with them by rubbing their backs and holding their hands. One of them fell asleep in my lap and the same happened to my husband. (Melting again.) We kept exchanging awkward looks. Like “what the hell are we supposed to be doing right now?” Believe me, I’m used to chaos. I think I mentioned that I have something like 9 nieces and nephews just on my side, but this was different. I felt so overwhelmed.

Anyway, somehow Baby Boy broke his appliance on campus yesterday, after hours, of course. I spent a considerable amount of time talking to on-call nurses, lab techs, and doctors who know nothing about Baby Boy's medical history and his situation. His doctor is highly specialized and the only one who does this procedure in this area. In fact, Baby Boy was the first person in Texas and only the third person in the United States to have this procedure done, it's been a lifesaver, but it can be frustrating to only have one person to go to when we have complications.

Let me start by saying that I have been really into coupons lately, buying a couple Sunday papers each week and printing some from the internet. I save at least 15 to 3o dollars a week from coupons! Well, this week I forgot to get my Sunday paper and lo and behold.....there were two Sunday papers in my condo's recycling bins. (We all share like 5 bins) Now, I didn't go looking for them, but when I opened one to put in our recycling they just jumped out at me saying..."Look inside me, I might have coupons!" And they did! So, I am looking around to make sure no one is thinking I am a trash digger, and I am taking the coupon inserts out of these papers. Who throws away coupons! Seriously! So, if you do, please give them to me, sheesh!

I hope you're enjoying the last summer wherever you are, because if you're like me, who gets excited easily just by seeing assorted berries laying in front of you like jewels, or the smell of the air early in the morning at at night, or just the joy of wearing flip-flops, shorts, or pretty dresses, you'll be dreading waiting for the next summer to come. I hope all these projects (work and non work) scheduled around me for the next few months will keep be distracted from the weather, at least then I can start baking with salted caramel, banana, chocolate, citrus, back again. There's surely something special in every weather you got :)
In the 1900′s fashion had a growth spurt. Some of the major fashion designers up until the 1940′s were Paul Poiret, Coco Chanel, Mainbocher, and Christian Dior. The styles went from an athletic boyish appeal to more of a statuesque. Short hairs, corsets, hobble skirts, feathered hats were in around 1910 and eveningwear as well as biased-cut dresses weren’t introduced until the 1920-1930′s. Clara Bow, Josephine Baker, and Greta Garbo were some of the women who were known in these times for their originality with these trends. In the 1940′s suits, trousers, and more structured like clothing were introduced. The movie Cover Girls, hit the scene giving fashion an even more unique personality, hence the platform shoe.
I prepared all week for it's homecoming. I cleaned out the fridge and the freezer.

I know I have taken some measures to make myself not feel like that (changed jobs for instance) and I’ve managed to wrangle myself a pretty decent chap that doesn’t make me feel that way.

Sadly, many people around the world, including Americans, will indeed give their uncritical support to a totalitarian world government and the oligarchic interests behind it. They have already bought the 9/11 lie, so they’re basically captured animals who can be led down any political path, no matter how horrible and evil.

However, my problem is sometimes I don’t feel inspired to create anything with them. It’s really hard to come up with a piece of quality work or something of value for a blog, article or story line. I need something to inspire me - that trigger from the idea that gets me going, writing something I feel so passionately about, that once I start putting pen to paper and write the first word, it is a catalyst for everything else whirring around in my head, to transpose on to the piece of paper where your pen is yielded; an effortless transition from brain to pen to paper and before you know it, the piece has written itself.
But there is also a nice irony at work. The tea party is opposed to massive government spending and bailouts. But QE is a way for the central bank to finance that government spending and to pump money into the banking sector. So on the day that the tea partiers may be celebrating, an unelected central bank will be carrying out a programme, probably totalling several hundred billion dollars, that will cut against everything the partiers stand for.

Nowadays, the writer says, even if you have platonic friends of the opposite sex, people around you generally still wonder if, wink, wink, there's any funny business going on. In our culture, he writes, "We understand romantic relationships, and we understand family, and that's about all we seem to understand. We have trouble with mentorship...comradeship...friendship....When we imagine those relationships, we seem to have to sexualize them."

Oh and I fancy a rant. The picture has my new stylish way of necking 30p a bottle Beck’s, but what is with the label? The whole box had bizarre labels. Wolves howling at the moon, references to music, and on this one a declaration to love music and hate racism. Now I would agree the two go together. The BNP lot do like there Wagner, displaying not only racism but an obvious dislike of music. But do I need this on a beer bottle? Why? What is the point? Has it changed me? No, not one bit. I wasn’t a racist before my bottle of cheap lout and I’m not one now. Is this a badge to proclaim my right on opinions, or a reminder to the German’s that make it not to start rebuilding gas chambers, or a view that the cooking lager aficionado’s of this world need to be to be reminded to be decent members of society? I have a horrible feeling this nonsense has cost me about a penny on my bottle of lout and am unimpressed.

The number one goal with this project was to keep only what I'll use, and only what I have room for. Keeping in mind that I might have to pack this stuff up, I was able to get it all in order, pared down a little, and most importantly, put away in their new homes.

This is a typical example of relatively accurate information delivered with an “attitude” to imply a coming catastrophe. Look at the temperature chart above. The global temps did indeed rise several tenths of a degree before 1940 which shows why measurement over a century would show a sea level rise. Then for 35 years the Globe cooled during the massive CO2 output of the post war industrial boom. Then global temps rose quickly from 1976 to 1998 which would result in a rapid warming and expansion of the ocean just NASA says which makes sense given the date of their data set, but since most of this happened before the post war industrial boom how is this mans fault?

SPICED CHOCOLATE CAKE
This comprehensive anthology of digital short films furnishes a unique opportunity to discover how some of the world’s finest directors respond to the challenge of making a film on a shoestring budget, and those seeking out more challenging fare will certainly find it here. Although the lack of editorial restraint has resulted in widely varying production values and an unfortunate lack of cohesiveness, the project has also inspired some of the most engaged cinema we’ve seen in some time. Most successful in this respect are the documentaries: in particular, the films of Eric Khoo, Pedro Costa, Bahman Ghobadi and of course, Bong Joon-ho’s mockumentary. Less happy in this regard are many of the experimental films, which seem blithely unconcerned with reaching beyond a small coterie of art house afficiandos, and by way of compensation don’t even offer the peripheral delights of stimulating visuals. A few appear to even flaunt their utter disregard for technical matters. Whether from narcissism or lack of inspiration, no fewer than five of the films deal directly or indirectly with filmmaking, with predictably uneven results.
When I started texting with my thirteen-year old daughter, Meghan, about a year ago (click here for further details on that nightmare: My Two Left Thumbs), she took it upon herself to educate me about which emoticons were “acceptable for society” (yes, that’s a direct quote), and which ones weren’t.
Damned if that don't look and smell like the Boston Lager, just a touch fruitier and toastier. On second thought, the hop smell in there reminds me of the Boston Ale. A little high on the carbo, but has a nice maltiness all over the tongue. It has some sourness on the flavor, not sure if that's supposed to be there. It's not bad man, nice maltiness to it like a brown ale should. I'm a little partial these days to the bigger flavor beers, like the Indian Nut Brown by Dogfish or Real Ale's Brown Ale. It seems to get a little better as it warms up.

Intellectually, Laurel was a lightweight. While Chaplin “found himself” almost instantly at Keystone, floundering only for a few weeks, it took Laurel 11 or 12 years to discover his character — and then only with a partner as a catalyst. While recent effort has been made to elevate Laurel to the status of the great comic directors, in reality he was never any more than a comic journeyman. To his dying day, he had nothing but defensive scorn for those who tried to “say something”, insisting that he just wanted to make people laugh. Of course he did — some of their shorts he did with Oliver Hardy are the funniest movies ever made. But there is nothing in the team’s canon to equal the best of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon, the Marx Bros, or Fields as films.
My mom eventually moved back to Florida and although I went back and forth between two homes, it was still Tracy who took on most of the parenting responsibilities: homework, discipline, involvement in church, unconditional love, extracurricular activities, etc…

The result is a 9.2% beer that falls fairly far outside the style on a number of dimensions--it's substantially drier, obviously a lot stronger, and the glass I received yesterday had no head (the pic at right is slightly misleading on that score) and was nearly still. But let's leave aside the style consideration--Belgians are not much for style, anyway. The real question is how it tastes.

We see Najib mocking the effects of tear gas on Anwar. So maybe Anwar didn’t get that much and maybe he’s really milking it for the publicity. But the tear gas was no laughing matter to the thousands of other Malaysians – young and old, men and women – who truly suffered its effects. Even hospitals were not spared!
Deogratias is told in flashbacks; at first it is a bit confusing (what is happening when?) but it quickly becomes apparent that Deogratias's appearance lets the reader know whether the setting is the present (1995), with Deogratias dressed in rags, or the past (1994), with his clothes fresh and clean and whole. And, of course, the change in his dress is not just because time has passed; the battered outward appearance reflects Deogratias's emotional and psychological damage.*
Then came the Civil War. Many in the county enlisted at Estill Springs in the 8th Kentucky Infantry. In spite of his age, Daniel was one of them. His headstone gives his year of birth as 1806, but on censuses, we see his year of birth being anywhere from 1800 - 1806. The cousins that I am in contact with don't know where this date comes from, but we'll go with 1806 as it's not uncommon for ages to be listed wrong on censuses. I've got one ancestor who aged fifteen years between one ten year census, and then only aged six year on the next one.

I'm not sure why I thought it would be a good idea to head to a theme park on my half day but somehow I did. A group of close girlfriends (we all work together) all had yesterday afternoon off, so we decided to do something - go to King's Island and ride roller coasters. Now, normally I'm a roller coaster FREAK - the higher, faster, longer all the better for me. What I don't do is anything that spins or swings - makes me sick in a heart beat. So, we all get there giddy as schoolgirls and head in. Everything is great - 4 of the girls want to go on the new ride that swings and spins, so 2 of us when to Drop Zone - where it raises you up slooooooowly to unimaginable heights, you sit there for a loooong time, and then it lets go. I have a little issue with heights, but that ride was SWEET! Total free fall for several seconds. Nice! Then we went on to another ride, which I was fine with - roller coaster. The third one is the one that jacked my ass up. You get in, get strapped down, and then the seats drop back so you're laying on your back. Then they take out out backwards. OMG. So not a good combination. Thankfully I didn't vomit, but it was bad enough that I went on home right away. Took a long, hot shower, curled up in the couch and waited for my momma to bring my son home. We both went to bed at 8:45 and I zonked out the entire night. Now this morning I'm still a little dizzy. Good Lord, I'm getting old!

Texts from your old pal Tommy:
As a participatory act in transformative history, Shoup’s work serves as an excellent primer for readers unfamiliar with economic theory and analysis. His work reminds us that history’s progression, acquisition and loss, building and tearing down, are about power and not a neutral and natural process: there are winners and losers. That the winning and losing is discussed in terms of alienation and self-actualization makes this work an important contribution to history broadly, and both American and labor history specifically.
You can get a glue gun from most diy type shops (B&Q Homebase etc) and the glue sticks are pretty cheap, the normal clear sticks can be found in pound shops, and you can even get coloured glue sticks and ones with added glitter as well, so they are quite versatile for any number of crafting jobs.

I had promised to take a pudding and we stopped to buy it, choosing a sticky chocolate and a sticky toffee pudding from the supermarket in Boringland, between here and Norwich. They turned out to be jolly good - each was supposed to serve four, but between four adults, a little girl and a baby, we scoffed the lot. Zerlina and Gus are easy to feed, it has to be said. Little z will eat most things, including vegetables (lots of carrots for preference) and Gus looks to be going the same way. His father had already given him his lunch by the time we arrived, but he accepted bits of carrot and so on to keep us company. He sat on my lap afterwards and tucked into small spoonsful of my pudding with Gusto (see what I did there?)
Yes I'm wearing my "high waisted" shorts again, I was just so unsure what to wear with this outfit and I took these pictures then put it with a different skirt and it worked even better so I'll probably post those up at some point in the near future.
The Jolly Green Giant has been around since 1928, and was originally conceived to promote the companies variety of unusually large peas that they sold. When The Jolly Green Giant started appearing in commercials, he was deemed as too scary and menacing, especially when he walked. This is why you see the giant simply standing in the valley with his arms crossed, and uttering nothing else but his jolly "Ho Ho Ho".
The blogger's answer is 'character'. The post links to the author's Character Chart, which opens in Word and is so exhaustive I think I'll retire now I've read it. I'm not a great one for planning at the best of times, but I really don't need to know the date of my character's grandmother's birthday in order to write consistently. Really, I don't. And as for preferred home decor style, whether they have ever been fined, and their favourite board game - huh? Am I doing it all wrong? The characters come into my head and I watch them do things. Then I write it down. They are like real people. I can tell what real people are like even if I don't know when their grandmother was born or whether they wear contact lenses.
I tell them my husband is deported and sometimes they leave it at that. Others ask "Why" (and others try and guess! like it's a game or something) but I always answer truthfully that he got in trouble. Some leave it at that and still others have to ask "What EXACTLY did he do?" At which point I always die a little inside because the answer sounds bad and it's not fair because they don't know the circumstances that led up to it, just the bare facts.

The box was great, especially the tray of Brazil nuts and chocolate buttons (!) but I had eaten most of the box by 11am. I then raided the sandwich bar at work for crisps and a Muller Rice. Probably too much, but I was still hungry. I am definitely more of a meal person than a graze person. I like to feel satisfied!
But, now I have another issue. Specifically my teenage daughter. I have always kept my dating life and home life separate. I have chosen to stay at the man’s house in the past or wait until all the kids are away to have him over. I have never introduced another man to my children. Let alone had him spend the night. BUT, it is different with Mark. We’ve known each other for years. We are already at the “comfortable” stage in our relationship. He’s already told me he has no doubt we will marry (and I tend to agree). Things feel different this time. They feel right. On all levels.

Tonally The Fog strikes a midpoint between the atmosphere heavy, surrealist subgenre of horror films from the seventies, like Lets Scare Jessica To Death and The Messiah Of Evil and the more sensationalistic brand of horror that the new decade would provide. Just because the film deals in agreeable haunted house scares does not mean that it’s incapable of some truly eerie moments. Carpenter’s Fog is a truly ominous presence as are the muted lights of his characters struggling through it (I can’t help but wonder if the film was another stylistic influence on Alan Wake); even without the presence of ghost pirates it creates a threatening atmosphere. Though there are a few gore shots Carpenter scores his best hits off the power of suggestion. He never reveals the true number or nature of his ghost pirates. There could be anything lurking in that Fog. Anything.
And this costing concept applies very well to all of you.
Authors love to incorporate conflict not only into their stories, but into the very fabric of their characters. It is conflict that drives the plot forward and engages the reader. The more adverse the conflict is, or a state of opposition, the more rewarding the victory is to the overcomers.
The Baroness, eager to show off her latest slice of chiseled man candy, and the Baron, itching to unveil his girl zombie and boy zombie (who have been dressed in orthopedic corsets and puffy shirts), the Frankenstein's sit down for supper. Suffice it to say, the awkwardness that transpires over the course of the meal is off the charts in terms of off-kilter one-upmanship. Since no-one is gonna come right out ask me who I thought came away from the bizarre show and tell victorious, I'll just go ahead and state that I thought the Baron won the day when it came to outdoing his spouse/sibling. He did, after all, make two people from scratch. All the Baroness did was hire a man to have sex with her on a semi-regular basis. The look on Nicholas' face when he sees that his friend's severed head has been transplanted onto the body of one of the Baron's zombies is pretty consistent with the trauma that normally accompanies that painful moment when you discover that the head of someone close to you has been relocated to a completely different torso.

I also knew today I was going to be able to get in my 4+ miles even though I had not done it in a couple months. I could just feel it in the air. My iPod started me off with "Womankind" by Annie Lennox from The Women soundtrack and really got me moving. The beat is great and very uplifting. I just added it to the mix a couple days ago and it is definitely a winner. I also like the next song from that same soundtrack called "I Feel It All" by Feist. It has a great beat but is a little bid subdued so it kept me from bursting out of the gate.

In our ultrasound a few weeks ago the ultrasound technician noted that the little girls head was just a tad smaller than the little boys head. She said it probably wasn't anything to worry about and the Dr said the same. Of course, the next few days I spent googling and worrying a lot. I am still a little worried but am trying to remain very positive until our next ultrasound in 2 weeks.

1. I enjoy categorizing, quantifying, comparing, and contrasting my sports indulgences. My most recent epiphany came this week when I realized that my two soccer loves, Tottenham Hotspur FC and FC Anzhi, both suffered similarly bizzare and crushing losses at the end of seasons in which they had overachieved and made it to the cusp of greatness: Anzhi’s 2-1 loss to Torpedo in 2000 on a dubious 95th-minute penalty when even a tie would have given them the bronze medal in the league (watch for yourself – do you think the Anzhi player (green) had a handball at 1:32?). Anzhi suffered relegation two years later. The last two years have completely revitalized Anzhi, but they’ve still never medaled in the top flight of Russian soccer.
— Law enforcement types favored the tougher possession law and opposed the medical-marijuana initiative, but lost on both. The medical-marijuana law has been amended a couple of times by the Legislature, but only after a consensus product was negotiated.

Persona limits are 24 ounces and 24 plants (6 mature and 18 immature). Doctors must grant permission, but they do not write “prescriptions.”
And good for him. At least he hasn’t dressed as a giant panda and made a joke about there being more pandas than MSPs suspended by their parties in Parliament.
Christ gave up His own life so the church could live. How can a husband possibly compare himself to Christ loving the church? I think he can by purposefully putting her needs, and even wants, before his own. I think he can demonstrate Christ to her by being understanding, patient, kind, and not placing expectations of what his opinion of who and what she should be, on her.

Winter, the kind with snow, finally began here on Friday. It was short-lived though. I shoveled steps, decks, ramps, and pathways blanketed by six inches of heavy white stuff until my arm muscles turned wobbly. My mittens were stuck frozen to the shovel, and despite the frigid temps, my head under hat was laden with sweat. I felt like I had just finished an exhaustive hour-long gym workout. But like I said, the gorgeous winter snow was short-lived. Rain soon swept in and reduced the mass to about an inch or so of undulating ice. I have yet to try the car on the long downhill rink we call the driveway. A walk to the mailbox yesterday revealed coyote tracks, emerging from the woods into our drive and across the road. Bello, my feline walking companion, curiously sniffed the tracks, looking about with caution. I suspect that the coyote had walked as we did only a short time previous.
I hated what I wore. Most of the kids who I admired wore better jeans, nicer shirts, and cooler shoes. I wanted to be accepted and fit in, and I wanted people to think that I was cool - but I knew that would never happen with the way I dressed and with the types of clothes I wore. My clothes screamed "poor" when all the cool people were rich. No combination was good enough, no shirt was cool enough, for me to overcome my belief that my clothes set me so far apart from others that I would never be accepted by those I thought to be cool.

I have a few children who are always ready with a word and then I have those who struggle. The obvious words are the first to be shouted out: ape, apple, acorn, and.... I want each child to have a word on the chalkboard so I give lots of hints. While helping one child, one of my girls raised her hand while calling out "Miss Bonnie, Miss Bonnie, I have a word". Certain she had thought of the word I was asking for, I called her name. "App". "Ape? Ape is already on the board." "No, app" showing me her hand while pretending to push buttons with a finger on the other hand, "app".

George Wickham is an old childhood friend of hero Fitzwilliam Darcy and the son of the Darcy family’s steward, whose dissipate ways estranged the pair. He is introduced into the story as a handsome and superficially charming commissioned militia officer in Meryton, who quickly charms and befriends the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, after learning of her dislike of Darcy. Wickham manages to charm the entire Meryton neighborhood, before they realize that they have a snake in their midst. Elizabeth eventually learns of Wickham’s attempt to elope with the young Georgiana Darcy. Unfortunately, he manages to do the same with her younger sister, Lydia, endangering the Bennet family’s reputation. He could have been the best of Austen’s rogues, if it were not for his stupid decision to elope with Lydia, a young woman whose family would be unable to provide him with a well-endowed dowry. Because I certainly cannot see him choosing him as a traveling bed mate, while he evade creditors. Here are the actors that portrayed George Wickham:

I was always moving art or furniture, and creating vignettes from whatever had caught my eye that day while meandering in the mountains behind my parents’ property.

Moreover, Santorum may actually have a better shot at Wisconsin and Minnesota than Romney. Additionally, despite Romney's winning the primary in Ohio, had Gingrich not been in the race, Santorum would have prevailed. I suspect Romney has less appeal in Ohio than a candidate who, like Santorum appeals to the lunch pail Reagan Democcrat. The smart play for the Republicans is the counterintuitive choice, Rick Santorum has the better chance to win.

The AT teaches us consciously to inhibit old tense habits of movement and to replace them by more economical patterns based on a new self-awareness — a new set of conscious ‘directions’ addressed by the mind to the body. Freeing the neck, allowing the head to go forward and up and the back to lengthen and widen, results in free and efficient breathing and in correct positioning of the other parts and organs of the body. This produces true relaxation. It requires learning a new body-grammar and allows us to discover the wisdom of the body and a new freedom for it. Having this freedom, the body moves with maximal balance and co-ordination and minimal effort.

Bell’s, a blended Scotch whisky that has been around from as early as 1825, is a well-known brand that is found in most pubs, bars and restaurants. After finding a bottle on my recent move, it would be unprofessional of me to let it sit there and not be sampled! So here goes - on the nose there’s a light nutty aroma with fresh fruit coming through as well. On the palate, a rather smooth oak taste lingers with a slight nut and spice coming through. A warm tingle after-taste follows which leaves a long flavour (which will be making you want to finish your dram rather quickly!) and at 40 % it’s not too strong and overpowering as some blended whiskies can be.
It took me three trips but they finally had boudin eggrolls tempting me from under the heat lamp - you have to get there early, way before the lunch rush.

This will make a great summer top - probably using the same pattern as I did here - the striped fabric is a polyester suiting that was also on clearance. I will be using this to muslin some pants (someday!). The print on the right is my favorite - it's a matte jersey and it's so soft and fluid. It will probably make me crazy to sew it, but it was so pretty I had to get it!
Am I ready for it?
STEP 2: Quickly rinse the mushrooms and slice them thinly. Place the sliced mushrooms in a skillet coated with non-stick spray, add the minced garlic, and sprinkle a little salt and pepper. Turn the heat on to medium-high and saute the mushrooms until they release all of their moisture and no more water remains on the bottom of the skillet (5-7 minutes).

He has said that I can have as much paper as I need. All I have to do is cough up everything I can remember about the British War Effort. And I’m going to. But the story of how I came to be here starts with my friend Maddie. She is the pilot who flew me into France — an Allied Invasion of Two.

Louv's message is about enriching our lives, making our lives stronger and more full, by not just protecting the living world, but also by celebrating it. I am liberally using terms he also used, from book jackets and my notes, because he is a strong and compelling author and speaker.
We are anxious to compare this to Vicksburg, MS where we visited in February. The Gettysburg Battlefield is bigger, I believe. The history that surrounds us and the town is amazing and gives us a sense of wonder just to be here years down the road honoring what held our country together.

The next time Connor sees his Gram he will be almost four months old. So much will have changed in that time. Babies grow so quickly and it saddens me that our family doesn't get to watch our children grow up.
Individuals with AS often lack the ability to use skills related to executive functioning like planning, sequencing and self-regulation.
I remember back in high school having to go up or down a flight of stairs to get to every class. I used to charge up the first five or so and get progressively slower eventually mentally pleading with my sluggish limbs to carry me up the last two or three stairs so I wouldn't be late to class. It seemed like the end of the world looking up that flight of steps. Boy, those were the days.

It disappoints me that 12 honest citizens could so easily be distracted by a wholly irrelevant arse snap. How could they be sure it belonged to the defendant in any case? There was no question of exposing her rump in open court, which might have given the judge a stroke, and you can’t accept the word of a queer-basher. As a result of their pusillanimity, a truculent hussy will be free to inflict further aggravations on innocent lesbians and their collaborators.
We're mostly ready. Not at work, but hey, if I can just finish two or three things, I'll rest easy about it. We've got our plans laid out for leave and are 90% sure about our plans for childcare. The upstairs is as clean and organized as it has ever been. It's nice up there - I want to spend time there. Amazing that a mere few weeks ago, we couldn't walk all the way into one room and had dedicated pathways to navigate the other. Everything up there now has a place (save the linen closet, which we are working on today now that we've gotten new shelving). The carseat has been installed and the hospital bag packed since the night before the cerclage removal. The co-sleeper, pack'n'play, swing and bouncer have been assembled and have batteries ready and waiting. The nursery is pretty much done, though DH is going to go over the carpet with the steam cleaner one more time (there is a persistent sort of stain in one corner - it gets lighter each time, but isn't gone yet). We've interviewed a pediatrician, and while I won't claim it was love at first sight, the practice's policies were in line with our own and she is board certified and affiliated with the hospitals I wanted and takes our insurance, so it's as good a place to start as any. If we don't really click with her, there are hundreds of others to choose from.
This is obviously a rather time consuming technique to finish raw edges, but I believe the end result is worth the extra trouble. The light weight rayon will not add bulk to your seams, it gives a very vintage feel to the insides of your garments, and it really is pretty!

The thrice-yearly school census, the details of which are specified in regulations, will continue to hoover personal data from school management systems about every state-funded school pupil and dump it on the National Pupil Database. This is a permanent data collection that includes information about behaviour and attendance. Exclusions for bullying, substance misuse and sexual misconduct each have their own codes, forming a permanent record of offences that were probably committed in the view of a headteacher- because the test for excluding a pupil is that the alleged behaviour occurred ‘on a balance of probabilities’.
(Because of this, we especially enjoyed watching a couple in a caravan opposite spending two hours trying to set up a satellite dish, before finally getting the Scrabble out. We're not wild campers by any means - we don't have a lovely bell tent and cook around a fire, but I made my own mind up about caravans many years ago. I did a lot of caravanning as a child, and firmly believe that once you open a cupboard to reveal a set of sherry glasses held into place by special clips, you are no longer allowed to use the phrase 'getting back to nature'.)

I can't write such scenes because I can't bear to be that close to violence. Sometimes I wonder if they need to be so graphic in telling a story (and sometimes I wonder if I'd have more success if I could write that way).
After a discussion of what types of clothing are worn in the winter and the importance of staying warm, the children were given paper hats, mittens, coats, scarves and boots to “dress” their paper dolls. It’s important to know, that this age group will not necessarily glue the appropriate clothing in the correct places! That’s okay…it’s important to let them create on their own.
I found a few things, but most of the pins were full of sugar substitutes ... 1/4 cup of splenda or six packets of sweet and low and honestly friends, I just couldn't bring myself to make anything like that no matter how hard I tried. It just sounded --- chemically (please don't send me nasty comments about your love of splenda, I know lots of people love it. It just weirds me out.) I was about to lose hope when a pin from My Recipes popped up.
We all agree a one-party state is not good for democracy. How important it is then to make sure it’s not just a shoe-in for more Tories in the coming election. Think before you put your cross.
However, the reality is, like all of Idema's so-called business ventures, it is a fig leaf designed to hide the hairy nakedness of a criminal venture by means of honest people like Penny Alesi and Herbert Doe (last name withheld per request by informant) with titular authority over Isabeau Dakota.
This need to fuel blackness causes Blasians to acquire a skewed view of what it means to be black — the stereotypes become more apparent as we try to pronounce this identity. We wear baggy clothes, grow out our fros, listen to a lot of rap music — whatever. Anything attributed to black culture is latched onto and we exhibit these qualities to let others know we’re as black as Wesley Snipes and the next brother. Except we’re not. My hair isn’t kinky enough. My skin isn’t dark enough. My speech is too proper and I don’t fit in at black church. So where do we go? Maybe we should try the Asian side.
Regarding Germany’s long-term energy goals, its renewable energy use would rise from 17% to 35% of its total energy usage by 2020. The WEF stated that this policy was “intended to bring Germany long-term economic and environmental benefits by putting it at the forefront of green technology.” In other words, Germany would be at the forefront of renewable energy (or one of the few); that this position would create new economic opportunities, which would be good for business, which in and of itself would create new jobs far in excess of 11,000. It does not appear, based on the argument presented in the WEF report, that switching from nuclear to renewable energy would have an impact on the economy. Even if one accepts the figure that 11,000 would lose their jobs, is the argument that Germany needs a nuclear industry so they can work a valid one?

What makes Charles magically human is what he said to me next and I have to quote him directly: “At this point, my condition forced me to make some decisions about my faith. I began to pray and to read the Bible unceasingly. God revealed the process of redemption–justification, sanctification, and glorification–with these scriptural verses: ‘I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me (Salvation). “Galatians 2:20 I thanks God for the gift of justification: “who was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification.” Then I began sanctification: “I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for sanctification.” Romans 6:19, “For ye are brought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.” I Cr 6:20

Yes, there is a new album by Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, and a very fine one. Carter passed on in 2002, but he was a prolific songwriter, and he left behind many songs that had never seen the light of day in his lifetime. In this case, Tracy Grammer discovered some recordings they had made together that she had thought were lost. Carter was the songwriter for the pair, and one of the best. He alternated between spiritual and earthly themes in his writing. Carter’s spirituality was not tethered to any specific religion, which freed him to write lines like “Rock me Goddess in the gentle arms of Eden”. Nor were his beliefs in any way a hodgepodge; rather, he found common ground in a wide variety of spiritual traditions, and he expressed that beautifully in his writing. Till We Have Faces is one of his finest songs of this sort. The song could be a mysterious telling of earthly love, or it could be a description of a ritual binding of body and spirit. It’s probably both. It’s the kind of song that prompts the listener to explore their own spirituality, which is exactly what the best writing of this sort should do. Grammer’s vocals and fiddle work here are also just beautiful. The background vocals are by Claire Bard, who I need to learn more about.

With the Jubilee only a few weeks away,I thought we would start looking at how we could incorporate it in to our play. I set up a little play scene on the table. I am not really sure what it is meant to be, but I thought it looked a bit like a street party with the King and Queen in the background. I wanted to add some gazebos (maybe made from K'nex) and some bunting but I know it would last all of 10seconds with under 2 year olds.

#1. Poochie with a butterfly. This was the first tattoo I got for my 18th birthday. My dad had died two years earlier and I wanted to get my first tattoo about him. Ever since the day I was born he called me Poochie. Very rarely did he call me Alexa or Alex as my family calls me. Since he died, I really don't think I've been referred to as that, so I wanted to get Poochie to remind me of him. I got the butterfly just for what they mean with transformation and rebirth. This is on my left inner wrist.
I believe a disconnect occurs when we have a future orientation. Yes, I understand the future orientation intimately. I lived there for many, many years.
While that may sound like a far-fetched, and, some might say, obscene thing to say, every word of it is true. You see, after, to quote the prologue of Café Flesh, "the nuclear kiss" destroys a good-size chunk of the planet, the survivors of the two warring sides struggle to replenish their ranks. It would seem that the majority of the population have lost their ability to reproduce. Those who can, however, are treated like heroes, and are encouraged by the provisional government to copulate as often as possible.

With his place in guitar history firmly established, Yngwie has continued to inspire guitarists worldwide for over a decade. He has released many classic albums including Marching Out (1985), Trilogy (1986), Odyssey (1988), Fire & Ice (1992), The Seventh Sign (1994), Inspiration (1996), Facing the Animal (1997), Alchemy (1999), Attack!! (2002) and Unleash the Fury (2005). He has also shown his versatility by producing his first completely classical work, Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in Eb minor, Op.1, in 1997. October 14, 2008 will see the release of his latest studio album, Perpetual Flame which he produced and engineered himself. The Fender® Custom Shop has also introduced the new Yngwie Malmsteen Tribute Series Stratocaster® guitar, a reproduction of Malmsteen’s beloved instrument that will be produced in limited edition.
NM: Thank you! Well, I’ve written another YA novel which may or may not find a publisher (It takes a few risks. And, although you’ll hear that the YA market is vibrant, it’s really only vibrant for paranormal romance and I can’t tell you how this is NOT paranormal or romance…) I’m planning two more Crabbit Publishing non-fiction titles, first the provisionally-titled Dear Agent. And I’m writing a novel for 9-11s (I love that age group) which I’ve started but which I’m finding incredibly hard. So I want to devote some time to that.

The suggestion of a must-report policy is the most concerning, but here’s another one that strikes me as problematic:
Too Faced Primed and Poreless is like a cross between my two current favourite primers: my Jemma Kidd Skin Rescue Bio-Complex Veil and L'Oreal Base Magique. The Jemma Kidd is a slightly oily feeling tinted primer, which provides such good coverage that I find myself using less foundation when I've primed using it. The L'Oreal Base Magique is a souffle primer that requires warming up between the fingers, but then smooths onto the skin like silk. So essentially Too Faced Primed & Poreless is like a thinner, more slippery tinted souffle primer. It doesn't add colour like the Jemma Kidd, but eh, it's got to count for something.

Artists came first to Taos, attracted by the extraordinary architecture of Taos Pueblo and the colourful culture of its inhabitants, as well as by the radiant light of Northern New Mexico. According to legend the painters Ernest Blumenschein and Bert Phillips were travelling from Denver to Mexico in the summer of 1898, when a wheel broke on their carriage. As luck would have it they were only a few miles from Taos, and that's where they went for help. They went no further.

For the last three years, convenience and grocery store owners in Colorado have been lobbying the state legislature for the right to sell high alcohol beer. They have been restricted to selling lower alcohol beers, like Budweiser, Coors and Guinness. Liquor stores and bars, who opposed the law change, can sell beers with higher alcohol, but were not legally allowed to sell those low alcohol beers, but law enforcement always looked the other way. (The law was imposed to keep higher alcohol beers out of convenience stores because teens with fake IDs tend to hang out there.)

Catch Me If You Can is an Intelligent, well-written film further intensified by its two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. But while based on a true story, I found it to be too unrealistic. Nevertheless they did a good job in keeping me intrigued the whole way. DiCaprio and Hanks’ acting were so convincing that you don’t doubt their character’s ability to influence and persuade others with their charisma. The film a tad too long, but altogether it was wrapped up nicely.

The star-burst pattern is a stencil by Coffee Break Design. The lady in the middle is actually a button. It's also one of Coffee Break Design's products. The pop-up is a little bit of serendipity. I wanted to use the lady, but I only liked the way she looked in the center of the star-burst which I'd already sprayed it onto the page. So I created a pop-up. It flips to the side to allow the page to close. I did some hand-doodling and some paper collage for the border, to finish out the page.

One caught our eye, but not in a good way. Now we hadn't tasted this beer, but we all felt suspicious about it. Why? We didn't like the name, Ole Slewfoot. Or the look of the pumpclip.

Oh sure, if it was a world beater, word would get round, but it wasn't. Just decent. I predict a slow mover.

2. Speaking of Ninkasi, I had a pint of the Total Domination. Whoa. My brother-in-law likes traditional English styles of beer (we scored an early perfect ten in his mind with Doryman's Dark), and when I had him sip the Blue Dot, he marveled. Later, I got the Total Domination, which like Blue Dot is a symphony of green, and he was intrigued. It's not as intense as some hop monsters--all the edges are smooth and approachable. It's just a saturated kind of citrusy hopping that hits all the notes--bittering, flavor, aroma. Yesterday, he ordered a pint and it appeared to grow on him over time. I don't want to project too deeply about his experience, but it's possible that over the past two days, I watched the birth of a hophead. A beautiful thing.

No Electricity = No More of These Things:
Peace, such a tough topic given the state of the world today. So many nations across the world are at war with one another, or sometimes with others within the nation, and so many people are at war with one another, or sometimes at war with themselves. As individuals and nations, people are crying out for peace, and yet war rages. War between two people is really just about a lack of love. When two people fight with one another it is because they fail to act in love. If they could consider the other person’s point of view, if they could step back from the situation, if they could just see the other person as a brother or sister then perhaps they could get passed the difficulties, but so often people cannot. In these situations what is needed is love and forgiveness. Somehow we as Christians need to find a way to break into the struggles between two people and show them love in order to enable them to forgive one another and move on. This will never be an easy thing to do, but it is only by breaking these cycles that wars between individuals will be resolved. As we walk with the Spirit we must endeavour to live at peace with those around us and to work to resolve conflicts between those we know and love. On a wider world scale, peace is even more difficult to achieve. When two nations are at war, conflict resolution is never easy, especially if the war has been going on a long time – ask the people of Israel/Palestine. So often in these situations we feel powerless. We feel that there is no way that such a conflict can be resolved. There is no way that everyone can be happy and so we think that the war will just continue forever. Perhaps a ceasefire could exist for a while, but it will never last. When we feel these things, we must look to the places in the world where conflict has been resolved. Look at Northern Ireland. For so long troubles raged and most people thought the conflict would never be resolved. Feelings were so raw, hatred so ingrained, fear so prominent…and yet look at it today. Okay, so it’s not perfect, but it’s an awful lot better than it was twenty years ago! So we can have hope for peace in troubled regions. If Protestants and Catholics in Ireland can put aside their differences for the sake of peace and a better future for their children, then maybe peace can come elsewhere too. Peace is not just about the absence of war, it is much more than that. When we hope and pray for peace, we don’t just want the fighting to stop, we want justice to be done. I’m a historian, or at least I was for a while whilst I was a student. I studied predominantly twentieth century history. Many of you who studied history even to GCSE level will be able to look at what happened in Europe in the twentieth century and see the problems that an unfair peace can bring. After the end of the First World War, the peace treaty that was drawn up was stacked massively in favour of the victors – and the German people did not forget this easily. During his rise to power, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party played on people’s sense of betrayal and the anger that they felt about the treaties that ended the First World War. Perhaps if the earlier peace agreements had been fairer, the Second World War may not have taken place. Obviously, this was just one of a number of factors, but it was certainly a factor. So when we look for peace now, we must learn our lessons from history. We mustn’t just look to stop fighting, but we must look for as just and as reasonable solution to the conflict as is possible, in order to reduce the risk of future conflict breaking out. Similarly, in many countries, peace is maintained by fear and aggression. Dictators or totalitarian regimes can rule countries that to the outside world appear to be peaceful, and yet they are far from it. Freedom of speech may be limited an often people are imprisoned if they threaten the stability of the country – even if this is just by writing something in a newspaper or holding a peaceful protest. Again this kind of peace isn’t necessarily preferable to conflict. Peace is only really peace if it comes with justice and freedom. There is a hymn in the Methodist hymn book, Hymns and Psalms that speaks about the desire for peace. Some of you may know it, though I’m not sure how well known it is. It is by Alan Gaunt and reads: We pray for peace, but not the easy peace built on complacency and not the truth of God. We pray for real peace, the peace God’s love alone can seal. We pray for peace, but not the cruel peace, leaving God’s poor bereft and dying in distress, we pray for real peace, enriching all the human race. We pray for peace, and not the evil peace, defending unjust laws and nursing prejudice, but for the real peace of justice, mercy, truth and love. We pray for peace: holy communion with Christ our risen Lord and every living thing; God’s will fulfilled on earth and all his creatures reconciled. We pray for peace, and for the sake of peace, look to the risen Christ who gives the grace we need, to serve the cause of peace and make our own self-sacrifice. God, give us peace: if you withdraw your love, there is no peace for us nor any hope of it. With you to lead us on, through death or tumult, peace will come. The message I leave you about peace is this: If we are to walk with the Spirit, we are called to strive for a peace that is just and true, between ourselves and others, between communities, peoples and nations, however difficult this may be.
AWP: Napoleon Bonaparte, (1769-1821) Emperor of the French, who established the bureaucratic structure of the modern French state, and reactionary pragmatist regarding women, said in a letter written in 1795: “A woman, in order to know what is due her and what her power is, must live in Paris for six months.” Does this claim resonate with the lives of the women in your book? In what way does Napoleon’s statement hold true with your experience living in Paris? How is Napoleon’s statement understood by women of today?

I ran to my mother’s room and grabbed one of her handpainted glass antique lamps and broke out both windows. Smashing the lamp to pieces and screaming at the top of my lungs hoping a neighbor would hear. My attempts to get help went unnoticed and didn’t feel the sting of the needle as Kurt stabbed me with a syringe during my tirade. My face went numb as they placed the brunette wig and large sunglasses on me. Once at the airport, Kurt helped me into the Cessna and buckled me in. I only woke once on the trip as my head fell on Kurt’s shoulder and he moved. Several of Joe’s roadcrew were left behind to have the windows replaced before my mother returned home from work that evening.
I appreciated the final moments of the novel where Mikhail and Lisbeth are reunited in friendship. Although they are in constant communication throughout the book via computer, they finally come face-to-face. Mikhail asks for friendship and Lisbeth allows him in, realizing all romantic feelings for him are gone and realizing she is finally linked in true friendship to another person.
Larry Derfner – The Nation – In his first public statement on the conflict with Iran, David Grossman, the leading Israeli novelist of the past generation and the strongest voice of his country’s moral conscience, told The Nation that he opposed an attack on the Islamic Republic by Israel or the United States, saying the likely consequences were more daunting even than those of Iran building nuclear weapons: here.
Oh er missus who'd have thought little old me would be nominated for a Mad Blog Award and in the Best Writer category. So I was merrily scrolling through my phone this morning at Chill n Chat and I saw The 1970's Diet in this category. I couldn't believe it.

This time I really got a good look at it and Liberty is truly beautiful. The boat then travelled up the East River, going under the Brooklyn Bridge and as far the United Nations building. Unfortunately, as it has been for the duration of my stay so far, the weather wasn’t perfect and visibility was somewhat poor but being able to see the Statue of Liberty more than made up for this. Once the boat tour came to an end, I made plans to meet up with Ingrid in the evening to be shown around the pretentious New York club scene.
At this point I deemed it an emergency. I walked up to his SUV. Which now he screamed at me from locked shatter proof windows.

This date coincided with a pre-existing pagan festival, which, in Germany, included rites to protect one against witchcraft. This led to a hybrid legend developing, in which witches were said to meet with the Devil on the eve of May 1, on the Brocken peak. The night of April 30th became known as “Walpurgisnacht,” and the annual meeting was dramatized by Goethe in Faust.

Nina was just waiting for the right family to come along and that’s when she was rescued by my “kids,” Amber and John. When she was adopted, Nina was already nine years old, stiff legged, gray whiskered and scarred with dog bites, her jaw slightly askew having been broken, no doubt during the baiting.

Adam brought energy, smiles and life into everything he did – whether it was trekking through the woods or bombing down a ski slope, playing and loving on his nephew and nieces, or sharing a joke with a group of friends. I met people as close as childhood friends who were his groomsmen to as new as Safeco Field employees he met at the last Yankees-Mariners game…sharing tear-stained smiles and choked moments of laughter was fitting for a man who brought lives together with his charm and genuine spirit, who wanted every moment to be a great story to share to the next person he met.

“There are times in a person’s life when, even in the midst of them, you know you’ll never be the same. Moments that forever serve as journey posts…..I saw God. The God who can’t sit still when the storm is too strong. The God who lets me get frightened enough to need Him and then comes close enough for me to see Him. The God who uses my storms as His path to come to me.”

I was 30 years old when I got the idea to walk around the world from my good friend Rich. It was a cold January evening when I told Rich I wanted to go on an adventure. I had two in mind. Drive to the tip of South America or fly to Australia and drive across down-under. Rich said, that’s been done before. I said, it’s 1970 what hasn’t been done. He said, no one has walked around the earth. I said, you can’t walk on water, he said, if you try you will get your feet wet but you can walk the land mass of the earth touching all three major oceans on both sides. Just walk the land in a circle and fly across the oceans.

We had left over rice noodles from when I made Spring Rolls last week, so I attempted to make my girls some Filipino food. I am a Filipina (never been to the Philippines though), but sadly I don't know how to make any authentic dishes and when I try, I make it healthy, so it kind of loses all the filipino-ness from the food.

Brian couldn't describe with words the peace and joy that flooded his life when he walked away from everything and followed after God. The world can give us its version of glory, but Brian explained that we were created to desire God. Nothing we consume will quench our yearning for God and His glory.
It is my contention that this dilemma can be genuinely disorienting. A proper consideration of the issues that bear upon it, will force you to confront assumptions of fact and value. What’s more, it will force you to think seriously about the degree of confidence that you place in your moral and factual beliefs.
The one thing I love about this look is the fact that every single item of clothing and jewelry is unique and pairs really well together: the rusted gold watch and belt, light worn out jeans and the oversized vintage collared-top. A favourite, thats for sure.
If you did the kind of thing to someone in the street, deliberately, the way Balotelli did that, deliberately, on the field of play, you’d be arrested and charged with assault. We’re not taking “mistimed tackle” here, and we’re not talking “he went in a little hard” – he clearly and deliberately (watch it on youtube if you don’t believe me) looked, lifted his foot, and tried to break Alex’s leg (or at least injure him).

The Golden Compass is wonderfully inventive. Just as a side note, I also greatly admired the movie, with its cool steampunk look. Lyra is a great heroine, you just love Pantalaimon, and you get very attached to many of the other characters. Full of action and suspense, The Golden Compass is a great book.

And Jesus, I thank You, for covering over all of our sins, with Your very blood. And Holy Spirit, I ask You to please, help us to love each other, and to forgive as we have been forgiven. In Jesus’ name, amen.

I’ve been around the block so the pattern of good old Liberal politeness while being excluded from positions of responsibility is not new to me. This is a phenomenon seen all over the Lib Dem party, across the country. As an executive member of the Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats group, I’ve spoken to many black and Asian members at party conferences who have told me about the challenges they face in their own local parties. I have heard the stories from party activists in other boroughs.
Prior to the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Afghanistan was hardly even a world player in growing poppy, which is used to produce both illegal heroin and pharmaceutical-grade morphine. In fact, the Taliban had been actively destroying poppy fields as part of an effort to rid the country of this harmful plant, as was reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on February 16, 2001, in a piece entitled Nation’s opium production virtually wiped out.

So what did we create?? Bethany just happened to be heading for her VIP tour to Ben and Jerry's (so jealous) so she chose to make business cards using all our great ice cream photos to hand out to whomever she met from the scoop shop employee to the new Ben and Jerry CEO (yes she had lunch with him. And yes, I am very jealous once again…seriously an amazing experience). I digress and back onto MOO. Me, I am putting together an Ice Cream themed basket for my daughter's school raffle and made some great ice cream themed greeting cards and round stickers to go with them. I was torn though..I have seen their mini cards and so wanted to get them but thought it'd be a waste since B got cards and we as a blog only hand out so many actual cards. But check out the mini cards. They are so friggin cute and definitely are conversation starters.

They actually beat us out of the RV park the next morning after Lynda and I stayed up until around 3 AM checking email and the sky, to see if we could spot the northern lights. No northern lights, but why did we even think we would see them? Because that reliable young lady in the restaurant told us we would. Duh!

Svein Sevje said in an Israeli newspaper interview Tuesday that while the Norwegian bomb and gun rampages that killed 76 people and Palestinian attacks should both be considered morally unacceptable, he wanted to “outline the similarity and the difference in the two cases.” Palestinians, the ambassador told Maariv, “are doing this because of a defined goal that is related to the Israeli occupation. There are elements of revenge against Israel and hatred of Israel. To this you can add the religious element to their actions.”

“The romance with the automobile, which has been the essence of Houston for most of its modern history, is clearly fading,” Klineberg said. “The suburbs are more crowded, gas prices and traffic congestion are soaring, fewer households have children at home, and the lure of urban amenities, both in downtown Houston and in suburban ‘town centers,’ is generating a sea-change in area residents’ living preferences.”

February in England is so often a sunny soft month, contrary to our expectations and beliefs. I remember many occasions when my daughter and myself would eat outside our cottage high up on the Bere peninsula, overlooking the river, on a sunny February day. As I think this I remember, to my shock, how so often I was ill and wrapped up in the weak sunshine. February seems to be an annual lowpoint, at least for me; the year's equivalent of the nadir of diurnal biorhythms; and once again I'm at a very low ebb physically. Stress and continual exhaustion take their toll, and flu has wiped me out.

Its easy to see how the NACTs are lining up to grab Auckland. John Banks heads a list of rightwing NACT candidates for the new Council. The left is as yet not putting up a serious fight. Len Brown has come out in opposition to the sale of public assets but only because there has been no referendum on the sales. But even this poses a threat to a NACT victory, so the dirty tricks brigade is in full swing to destroy Len Brown. That is not helped by Len Brown's naivety and his weak campaign organisers.

Everything is looking good. I’ve gained 28 pounds, and although people are starting to comment that I must be due any time now, I’m measuring right on target. The comments, I confess, have made me a little nervous, as I started measuring ahead of dates right around this point with Finn. I developed polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) – to the point that at 38 weeks I measured 44 cm, just 2 cm shy of what I measured full term with the twins. The condition was caused by Finn’s intestinal malformation, caused by Down syndrome, neither of which we knew about until after his birth. I’m not afraid of Down syndrome. But the thought of having another baby who might need almost immediate surgery and hospitalization? Yeah, that puts me in a cold sweat. All that to say that I was very relieved today to learn that I’m measuring right on target.

As we headed to class, we were about 10 minutes early and I poked my head in the room because it looked like the class had already begun. Ummm... that wasn't my class. I was in the wrong BUILDING! This is why I have a planner... I should have USED it. I had written down in there what building I was in and for some reason I was convinced I was in the same building as her. I had to book it across campus in 10 minutes (which required driving, as it was down the street a ways) and just barely made it on time. Luckily, I have great school friends because, they saved me a seat next to them. ;)
In Darwin’s day the cell was viewed merely as a blob of jelly but now we know that molecular structures contain many complex parts which must be present at the same time to function properly (i.e. they cannot evolve step-by-step). The interesting thing is that the molecular machines in the cell are more complex than even an iPad or an aeroplane and filled with intricate parts which all need to cooperate with one another to function properly. The implication is that such irreducibly complex structures cannot be built by natural selection because by definition, natural selection requires each component to be immediately useful to the organism as the molecular machine is being built (or else it is eradicated).

Stir in the last 4 ingredients and return to a low simmer. Check seasonings and adjust salt if needed or others to suit your taste. I normally add a tad more chipotle chili powder. This last addition of spice is to layer in more flavor, to bind of sorts while intensifying the seasonings essence without creating a bitter aftertaste that overcooking chili powder can sometimes do. Simmer on lowest setting for another hour.
Well, it's an end of an era...

This version of Charlotte Brontë's classic novel has been innovatively adapted and by Shared Experience's artistic director Polly Teale. Central to the play is Teale's exploration of the idea that Bertha Mason, Rochester's first wife, is a manifestation of Jane's passionate inner self. The beauty of the play is that Teale manages to create a thrilling piece of drama whilst remaining faithful to the plot of the novel.

The drawers/window seat. There were no cabinets/drawers/window seats in this area. The old owners had a little round table with chairs.

The story lends itself well to darker retellings as well as romantic ones. Perhaps young men and women are lured into the Other Kingdom to dance for the Faerie Queen’s pleasure.

Vinay: Being at KIS gave me the independence I needed to grow as a person. It gave me mental strength….I learned how to handle situations on my own. I learned about diplomacy and how to be a good speaker. I used those abilities in Drama, which I enjoyed being a part of. Living as a community helped me build strong, family-like bonds with people. I learned to have empathy, and helping people became important to me. I was able to do this with Social Experience and Youth Rise. Bryan Plymale is my favourite teacher….he taught me so much about charity and sustainability. He has such a positive and motivating attitude….he’s my guru!
…..except for our broadband connection. Whether the fault lay in the router or the laptop I don’t know and J didn’t much care either way. The fact that he couldn’t connect to his favourite site was enough to spark a tantrum of gargantuan proportions! Being told to wait just fanned the flames higher. J screamed, stormed and menaced. Added to the problem was Dad’s disappearance from the house (as he fled off to teach a student) leaving me to grapple with setting up another computer to allow him to watch a DVD whilst sorting out the connection problem on the other and preventing J from harming himself. The connection wizard finally and after several irritating pop up windows/reboots, (which on our very slow computer is beyond frustrating,) sorted out the problem and normal service was resumed. J realising that his plans could now be fulfilled transformed into a happy boy, tears instantly drying on his cheeks, a smile lighting up his face.

Judas, the traitor, helped them, and the temple guards arrested and bound Jesus in Gethsemane, outside the city. They and their accomplices had come armed with weapons in case they had to subdue him, or torches if he should hide and they had to search for him.

Today I wanted to share something I made for my granddaughter's birthday coming up next week! (She doesn't go on the computer or I'd be worried about her seeing this! LOL). Anyway.... for Christmas she got one of the American Girl doll's doggies, and that makes 2 doggies for her now and she really wanted a bed for them. So.... since I made her curtains for her room, I bought extra fabric to make sheets and pillows for her AG doll bed, and this little doggie bed. The doggie bed at AG costs $22.00! You're kidding!!! LOL! Anyway.... this month's set, Paw Prints from Our Daily Bread designs provided the perfect little paw print stamp for the inside fabric. I stamped it with Stazon Ink directly on some fabric. When stamping on fabric, you want to let the stamp rest on the fabric for a moment longer than on you do on paper, to be sure it has absorbed all the ink.

It was difficult at first. It was annoying to have to pull out a notebook and write down a sentence or two while you went about your day. It felt awkward and made me feel self-conscious but by the end of the course it had become so natural. I felt naked without my notebook. Two years later I still carry it around with me. I use it to write down quotes I like, ideas that come to me and books I want to read.

DH, Macie and I hit up Di.sneyland on Saturday. Now, the backstory is that Macie has had about 4 days of pooping 5 or 6 times. Sometimes soft, sometimes hard, but lots and lots of poop. We don't know if something in her diet changed that we can't pinpoint, or if she has some of daddy's spicy sauce on her rice and that caused it, but generally, it just means she's had a really red bottom (ouch!) and we're ointmenting it up.

I only want to comment on three more things about it.

Said the leader of Golden Dawn,"The day of national revolution by the Greeks has begun against those who are selling us out and looting the sweat of the Greek people." Golden Dawn members typically wear black, display an emblem similar to the Nazi insignia and are are extremely anti-immigrant. Television ads run by the group during the campaign referred to immigrants saying, "let's rid the country of this stench."

I had a dream I was in history class in high school. Some autist was sitting behind me and kept repeatedly poking me in the back while saying "Delinquent" every time he poked me. This really pissed me off so I ended up pushing him to the ground and beating his face in.
All three lists offer information on a wide variety of great imported beers and Japanese microbrews available for home delivery in Japan. Orders can generally be handled online, with payment by credit card, bank or postal transfer or COD.
So, I'm cracking the whip (metaphorically speaking of course!) and getting my troops in order a bit. No more leisurely breakfasts, followed by bickering over who's turn it is to wash the pots. Jimmy's classic comment this week was, "It's not my turn, I washed them yesterday." YESTERDAY????? See what I mean, they haven't a clue and it's probably my fault for not getting them more organised sooner. I want to stop feeling embarrassed each time the postman comes to the door, I want to get this work/play balance sorted out so I don't feel like the skivvy so much. And I'm going to kick the children out into the garden more so they get more fresh air and I get a bit of peace and quiet!!! I need to get this right as I have been getting so low, getting all tearful whenever Conor has left for the yard and I'm on my own with the children. I really did want to do this home educating malarky, but I think I need to take control a bit more and expect more help more often. Otherwise it won't work.

Here’s the last picture we ever took of Avery. It was taken approximately 15-20 minutes before her lung collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest. She was sitting on her mommy’s lap looking at me and all it took to get her to smile this big was for me to keep saying “Hi”.
If the good news of Jesus were shared by deserving people, by people who lived outside of the “real” world, by people who were BETTER than others, Christianity would have flopped. Good thing God knew better than to choose THOSE people, right?
Established authors, for the most part, do fine selling through online bookstores. It’s new authors who lose out if browsing in bookstores becomes a thing of the past. Advances for unproven and non-bestselling authors have already plummeted, by all accounts. Literary diversity is at risk.

Honor receives her brother’s last letter from Iraq three days after learning that he died, and opens it the day his fellow Marines lay the flag over his casket. Its contents are a complete shock: concert tickets to see Kyra Kelly, her favorite pop star and Finn's celebrity crush. In his letter, he jokingly charged Honor with the task of telling Kyra Kelly that he was in love with her.
There are plenty of questions to be asked? Will Labour in Newport oppose their Government in Cardiff's plan to build an extra tunnel at Brynglas? Will they allow the potential destruction of 150 homes and the blighting many more? Or will they say and do nothing? Will their government in Cardiff finally sort out the opening of the Ebbw Vale to Newport railway? Will the cities elected Labour representatives vanish from sight for anotherr five years?

Some of the details…
Many of us have probably already watched Katy Perry’s music video, “Part of Me.” In that one particular scene after confronting her cheating boyfriend, she went into a public restroom and started chopping off all her hair in a fit of tearful rage. After that, she signed on for a tour with the marines in Iraq and began a grueling training to become one of the meanest fighting machines the world has ever produced.
Looks like a vintage shop somewhere, don't you think?
So as soon as I got through the aquarium I headed up to the Imax alone. The next movie had started and I couldn't get in. So I went to the main gate and found the lost and found desk. I explained that my daughter had lost her camera. They asked for a description and I told them purple. That's all I could remember. The guy reached over like he was headed for some forms and I thought, oh great, I've got to fill out a form! But he reached past it and pulled out a purple camera! WOOHOO!
Other things that were on the upside this week were getting a better cube at work (it has windows and isn't on the other side of the men's room!!!) and I found a long lost friend. I haven't tried to contact him, but I will soon. At least I know where he's located. He's a priest that was an old family friend. I knew him when I was Phoebe's age and he has always been the sweetest, nicest person. He was very influencial in my life and my desire to be such a good person to all people. He used to write me letters when I was growing up from India where he was a missionary training new priests, Rome and last was from Sao Paulo, Brazil where he had a parish when I was in college. He's back in my old hometown area and I have the information for the rectory where he's staying. I'll be calling very very soon to see if I can speak with him.
The new apartment is pretty much... the bomb. I know that phrase is old and perhaps a little tired, but if it fits, well, it fits. Imagine if you will: entering your domicile, but oh! First! You've gotten your mail! Out of the box right next to your door! RIGHT next to your DOOR!! I know that's more exclamations than a lot of you like, but you go get your mail in the pouring rain and then traipse back across the complex and fumble with it as you try and open the door. You'd be excited to find it right there for you when you come home, too! If you have to go potty, you just turn left and there is the bathroom, with a window high up near the ceiling that lets in so much light you need only flick the switch at deepest midnight. If not, just continue down the hallway, beside the 18 foot long floor-to-ceiling closet until you come to the galley kitchen, which is open onto the onlyroom. I call it that, as it is the only room: it's a studio. Bedroom/living room takes too long to type. The onlyroom possesses the star attraction of the apartment, even better than the DISHWASHER! (How did I not mention the dishwasher?)
The most meaningful sentences of a lifetime are always accompanied by a look, a glance without which words wouldn't mean the same. We might have not given it some serious thought so far, but those looks remain in our memory, no matter what.
“The horse ran a valiant race,” Sheppard said. “And, it’s not like he was struggling during the race. The rider wasn’t aggressive with his whip. After he crossed the finish line, I was talking to the riders of other horses that I had in the race. I looked over and saw that he was down.”
I used this beautiful girl from Digi my World, "Winter kids 2", and colored it with acuarelable pencils. I used a white oval embossed with "star, circles and dots" folder and another turquoise oval as mat. This girl reminds me of my daughter as her snowsuite is turquoise and her skates are white, her long hair and the pink cheeks.
We then headed to The Wild River Brewing and Pizza Company, whose pizza was recommended by the previously mentioned barmaid. We walked over the enormous bridge joining Brookings and Harbour, which is the adjoining harbourside community. The bridge was very long and incredibly high and not great for pedestrians or vertigo sufferers, I could see why Americans drive everywhere. It was then a long walk to the actual venue along a main road with no paths, plus there were some unusual people around – again not really for pedestrians. We decided in advance to take a taxi back, praying that there were actually taxis in this town. We ordered pizza – which was nice although they chose to cook only certain toppings for some reason so I had lots of uncooked green peppers on top – and ordered Wild River ESB on draft (4.3%, the weakest yet!) which was a pleasant English style bitter, a mixture of hops and malt and copper coloured, and it drowned out the memories of the uncomfortable walk quite nicely. (And we did manage to get a taxi back to Brookings, fortunately).
It's all quite homey and heartwarming. And look! Bobby Flay drinks Pellegrino just like me!

I realize television shows don’t always make good on their promises, or even get the chance to do so in some cases, but the first Episode of Outcasts left me hungry for more, and I look forward to watching the remaining seven episodes. If you too were disappointed by Terra Nova, were a fan of Battlestar Galactica’s gritty human drama, or just plain love sci fi, I strongly recommend you give Outsiders a try.
Recently I tried to convince Bruce that it was soft-porn (aka Art), so I re-watched it with him, and no, there's not nearly so much nudity as I thought. He told me there was bugger all nakedness in fact, and that it was a fucking weird flick and he was going to hit me several times quite hard for making him watch it when he could have gone out for a rub and tug...
20.) Without Me, There Would Be No Ethics Bill - NOT EXACTLY, you didn't
I found this idea some time ago on a wonderful blog. When my old computer crashed I lost all sorts of terrific places and information so I designed this from memory. Well, my memory must not be too great because it took me two days of fiddling with it to get it just right..lol.
I know I don't want to be there, especially not without the man I love.
I have used all sorts of bags in my search. An over-sized handbag/tote - I found the one big pocket hopeless for organisation. A quite pricey Oroton nappy bag, pretty, sure, but it for me it felt bulky and never seemed to fit all our stuff, it also did not wear terribly well. A nappy back-pack, practical yes, ugly yes and Oh so heavy. I was beginning to think I was on the search for the impossible and I would never find the right bag for me but I have!
With my mother still living in Trinidad, my sister with her family in Alaska, and my then-girlfriend (now wife) Melanie out of town for a family reunion, Jimmy was my primary source of support. He allowed me to punch things when I needed to, fetched me cigarettes and caffeine, and drove me around at all hours of the night simply because I couldn’t bear having to sit still, all the while listening to me bawl my eyes out and preach my hatred against the world. Once the waterworks were opened, there was no turning them off.
Sleuth - Okay, I need to quibble about the poster for a second - "Caine Law Pinter Branagh"? One of these things is not like the other, and it's not Branagh, though he hasn't made a decent movie in about 10 years. This actually looks like it could be a lot of fun, though, as long as Jude Law can somewhat stand up to Michael Caine in prolonged one-on-one scenes.

Marketplace has until now been found with considerably contempt from your industry per se countless report that not only will it undercut their company, but might pressure a lot of payday advances corporations to shut their opportunities for good. This is because of in part to the fact that a large part in the payday advances industry banks on reliable consumers who supply go back company for these institutions. It is often originally approximated that the new legal guidelines could cost the about Dollar100 trillion in earnings from expenses inside the fresh. This might significantly impact a marketplace which includes noticed monumental growth since it first started to completely survive from the 1990′s.
This is slightly more difficult; you’ll have to worry about an early-game Marine + Marauder attack. Or, even the Marine + SCV rush, which has recently surging success. To really survive against this, you’ll need a lot of Zealots and a lot of Cannons. Massing Cannons is extremely productive. Also, you’ll probably want to go with a Void Ray + Carrier + Mothership attack rather than just Void Rays. However, you’ll want to obtain an early Void Ray anyway to possibly harass your opponent’s economy and/or expansions. Just be careful: If your attack is too slow, your opponent’s Scanner Sweep can pick up on your aerial intentions. If possible, do a lot of teching. Upgrades, especially in weapons, will help. If map space allows, you can even consider moving your main air force out of your main base, just so a Scanner Sweep won’t get vital information.

My first attempt was on Barry M's Navy.
The first week I spent just getting into order, finding my way around, getting stuff we needed for the flat (still not completed, but we have decided to give up on it, both of us tired of walking around shops). I also had to go to the Police licensing department 3 times before a guy was kind enough to inform me that I no longer needed a temporary drivers license. First time I went the guy just handed my papers back to me and informed me I could only get a temporary license with a residence visa, but I thought that was when you exchanged your old drivers license for a UAE one. S then went to another police licensing department close to where he works, and was told more or less the same thing. After some more research we decided to try again, that maybe not many people asked for temporary drivers licenses.
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.

Even after you’ve fully beaten LADX with 100% completion and 0 deaths though, you’ll come back to it every now and again simply because it’s just such an awesome game!

Narrative and Creation Story
It was around this time that I was reading “The Mixed-Up Chameleon” in my elementary school class. For those who are unfamiliar with the story, allow me to summarize Eric Carle’s masterpeice of children’s fiction. A chameleon is going about life very carefree. He is gray and dull when he is hungry and sparkling green when he is full. He eats flies and changes colors when he sits on things – ya know, a chameleon.

He proposes that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala be given the job, partially to overcome the injustice of her losing out in the competition for top position, but also to bring into the World Bank a person of stature and experience who can offset the limitations of Kim’s background. Of course, even in the unlikely event that Qureshi’s sensible advice is followed, it fails to address the fundamental issue of creating a more legitimate, just, and effective structure of global governance.
I made it back from my annual retreat with my friends. Everything went well except for the earthquake in Japan which put a mild damper on things and the absence of Alex which put a bigger damper on things. I won more games than normal and had a very good time.
Eastern Catholics (those Catholics which celebrate other liturgies such as the Byzantine, Armenian, Coptic or Syrian liturgy) generally adopted the later Roman practice of delaying communion until “the age of reason” once they entered union with Rome (1500 – 1700s A.D.) and thus discontinued infant Communion. This is explained by Pope Benedict XIV’s encylical Allatae Sunt (On the Observance of the Oriental Rites), given 26 July 1755. First, Pope Benedict XIV explains that:
My friend is always a super early, very responsible type. I was concerned when she hadn't arrived by 9:20. Thinking she might be stuck in traffic, I called her cell phone and got her voice mail. She's been out of work since Friday with her blood pressure. Still nothing by 9:30 and just her voice mail. That's when Duane got up and we conferred. If I left on the next bus, I would be two hours late and that's a half a point. Duane said, "Well, the perfect attendance you were going for November is shot anyhow, just call in and take the whole point." Besides, I would have been a nervous wreck when I finally arrived, and had a lousy day.

Words can't describe how beautiful this island is! The water, the mountains, the jungles. *sigh I will say that if we were to ever be fortunate enough to go back, we would just go to a resort and keep our outings booked with tour guides. The region is very poor and you get LOTS of people trying to "sell" you things and take advantage of tourists. In the morning we did the jungle zipline. Then a traditional Jamaican lunch that was alot tastier than I imagined. Then we drove over to the Dunn's River Falls for a hike to the top. We started at the beach and went all the way up. Needless to say, my calves were screaming at me the next day. We had a very active and adventurous day in Jamaica, and that's exactly how I wanted it.

I had heard about this marriage event on the radio and checked it out a couple months back. We were not sure if Josh would be off that weekend, so we didn't pre-order tickets. If he was off and we could get a sitter, we would just pay at the door. And it worked out that he would be off and his parents & sister would keep the kids for us. Perfect.

If there’s one trend that I absolutely cannot stand, it is the functionalist view that every course of action pursued by Humans should necessarily serve some sort of goal, or practical application. This, of course, rapidly gives rise to the idea that all Human actions can be thought of in terms of their monetary value; in essence, reducing all Human interactions to quantitatively-described financial transactions, thereby (paradoxically) cheapening the value of Human life.

By the time I was 8 years old, my calloused feet might have passed for a hobbit’s, thanks to frequent barefoot explorations across the grounds. My sister and I knew exactly which trees to grab onto as we raced down the path from our grandparents’ house to the creek and waded toward our favorite sections: the Cinderella Steps, the Foot Washer and the Water Slide. We made frog houses in the sandbars, used a strainer to catch minnows, and explored the dried-up pond in which my mother once saved her younger sister from a water moccasin.

So what’s the alternative? The next possibility he considers is that, rather than choosing to do something wrong, perhaps the theist without evidence is defective in some way, broken, or ill, or otherwise malfunctioning. That’s all very well, he says, but the theist might also say that the atheist is broken or ill or malfunctioning or full of sin or whatever, and doing the wrong thing for that reason. How do we decide which one is actually malfunctioning?
I love serving meatless meals for my family. Not only is it more healthy but it is very budget friendly. I am super blessed that my family loves chickpeas.

Every year, the NFL Draft is a combination of the most optimistic and most exciting weekend of the season. On this weekend in late April, every team has the opportunity to improve themselves, even if they don’t draft in the top ten or even in the first round. The funny thing about opportunity is that it can easily give way to desperation. Bad teams, especially if they have a coach or GM who is one step away from the unemployment line, have a tendency to take this great opportunity and turn it into a screw-up so bad that Leon Lett would say “Wow, sucks to be them”.

When working out becomes a staple in your everyday routine, it becomes less of a chore and more of a necessity for life. This begins to creep into your subconscious and before you know it your good friend Mr./Mrs. Conscience haunts you for having missed your daily exercise routine. Next thing you know you’re craving a workout, or some form of energy release. Last night I was knee-deep into a video game (yes, I’m an avid gamer) and tossed my evening workout to the side. It was fine until about 8 o’clock. Then suddenly I’m receiving all of these messages from my brain constantly letting me know how disappointed my body was for missing the workout.
To prove my point, I've assembled a collection of my past photographs. All except one woman is French and I knew she wasn't when I snapped her picture. I suspect this time you won't be able to guess which one she is. There's a good reason why you may not find her, but I won't tell you now.

“If you really loved me, you’d make time for me,” a friend scolded me last weekend, sitting on my couch at the tail end of a low-key party the roommate and I decided to host in honor of the last evening cool enough for a fire out back. It was close to 1:00 in the morning, my clothes and hair smelled like smoke from being out near the fire for hours, and I admit up to this point I’d been half asleep and only half paying attention to what was going on around me. This statement kind of jolted me. Mostly because while I feel guilty, there’s not really anything I can do about it for the next several weeks.
Paul was indeed an authority on this subject, having been involved in religion, experiencing the violent opposition of religionists and then warning us of the danger of such people. He experienced the fruit of religious activity among the churches of Galatia. From 3:1, we read,

Next up is a wonderful dramatic piece from Iceland, not that this year’s Icelandic entry lacks a sense of saga. Hugarro, which my online translator says means “Peace of Mind”, is sung by Magni Asgeirsson. He has one of those voices that makes you think he’s experienced a lot of troubles in his life, and this was his 4th attempt to represent Iceland at the Eurovision Song Contest. Last year he came 2nd with “Eg trui a betra lif”; and this year he slipped down to 3rd, so he’d better pull his socks up in the future. The opening keyboard sound has something of the Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence about it. See what you think.
The book leaves us with some appropriate questions to ponder. For all practical purposes, teens feel powerless. They crave the independence they perceive adults to enjoy, but they are stymied at every turn. But they are saddled with not being old enough to do many of the things adults do, while taking on very adult-looking physiques and many of the urges that come with adulthood. Daniel begins feeling these urges for Mollie, and you get the sense that she feels the same way, not that either of them know what to do or how to talk about it. They are powerless to act because they don't yet have the skills or abilities to do so.

Fast forward to this year. There is a long, sad story behind my attempt to make a sheath dress that ended with some very pretty silk shantung sewn into a dress that will never be finished. I now know what I did wrong, and it actually might have been possible to correct that last tweak that made the shoulder princess line veer off instead of going straight, but when I tried on the dress I discovered that sheath is not my best look.

The Emergency Tax is an amazing thing, kind of the creamy center of a towering cake of taxes Pennsylvanians pay when they buy booze. First, there's the actual cost of the packaged beverage. The federal excise tax is added at the producer/importer level. Then the fun starts. The State imposes its set mark-up (for "profit", which in the case of so-called "control states" is really an additional tax, since it all goes to the State) of 30%. Now put that luscious Emergency Tax in there, adding 18% of the cost, the federal excise tax, and the 30% mark-up onto your bill. Think that's rapacious? Wait, there's more! That's right, folks, now you get to add the 6% State sales tax (7% in Philadelphia County)!

I mentioned that "Work It" was debuting last night. Imade the observation that everything about it looked horrible - not simply because it was disgusting but because it seemed to lack anything worthwhile whatsoever. Including humor. Early reviews are now kind. One review is headlined "Work It Is Officially the Worst Show on Television". If it didn't suck it might survive more than a handful of episodes but it does so it won't. I'd be surprised if more than 10 of these ever see light of day. Buh-bye....And good riddance.

Anyways, so if I was FAAB, and didn’t identify as a man, what right would I have to call myself a fag? I never identified as gay even as a MAAB person. When I told my parents I was trans* in high school they didn’t believe me, and my mom said she thought I was just gay and in the closet about it. They didn’t believe that I was primarily attracted to women and female people (why would someone transition if they would become queer?). Being out as trans* and letting myself express a less binary gender has let me open myself up to being attracted to men and male people, but to me this is anything but heteronormative sexuality. When I’m out with my best friend I like that people don’t know whether we’re a pair of dykes or a pair of fags. I think this might be partly why I’m always so attached to visibly queer and gender nonconforming folks in my life.

Adversity brings out the true character of the individual and this squad has shown that the trait most regularly deemed to be missing, is in fact there in abundance: mental strength.

Yet they continued to play their ‘game’ and reward has come.
Introverts are more sensitive to stimuli and new situations. They begin tasks slowly but then work deliberately with fixed concentration. They persevere with difficult tasks through to completion. Extroverts soak up new stimuli, and dive into tasks enthusiastically. They are easily distracted and tend to give up on difficult tasks more quickly than their introvert counterparts.

Read a lot – don’t be afraid of genres that you’re not necessarily into and be sure to get your nose into some of the classics and some nonfiction. The point of reading as a writer is to expand your universe, not to check up on what everyone else is doing and copy it. Write a lot, even if it isn’t publishable. You have to start getting in a groove and making mistakes so that you can see what works and where your comfort zone is. Live your life and say yes to opportunities – even a trip to the grocery store could give you an idea for how a character might behave. I feel like I know so much more about emotions than I did when I was in my teens and twenties since I’ve gone through that much more life – and I hope I’ll keep feeling the same way with the more time I get under my belt.

It began when the Philadelphia school district decided to eliminate their free lunch program for children in need and instead provide free lunch for all students. I looked at Scott and warned him that this was the first step in schools declaring that parents could no longer send lunch for their own children to school. That schools would either say that they could feed our children better or that they were worried kids who eat the school lunches might feel singled out for not bringing a lunch of their own. And so today the article was finally there. A Chicago school district has banned lunches brought from home because they believe they can feed our kids better.

Kansas City Restaurant Week (Friday 01/20 – Sunday 01/29) is happening as we speak, well I guess as you read. There are 139 local establishments participating. Each restaurant has a fixed menu for $15.00 per person for a 2-course lunch and $30.00 per person for a 3-course dinner. The prices do not include beverage, tax, or gratuity. All of the restaurants are donating 10% of the meals purchase price to Harvesters. In 2011, this event raised $80,000.00 providing 400,000 meals to the less fortunate.

One is tempted to ask the question “where in deed is the heart of darkness today ? ” Is there a realistic fascist and racist threat coming from the extreme political right in Europe, who managed to gather less than three-hundred activists in Aarhus ? Or is the real threat of fascism and racism so systemic, so entrenched that we are walking in the very center of it without smelling the boot of fascism right under our noses ? Is it Aarhus, yesterday ? Or is it NATO Head Quarters, the Pentagon, the European Parliament with it´s anti terror laws that have utterly undermined civil liberties, FEMA camps, US-Administrations with Patriot Acts and National Defense Authorization Act`s – every day ?

I've know my friend for 22 years now and met nearly everyone in her family with the exception of her youngest brother. When I came back to Tennessee to start the caregiver position for them I met him. It was a brief encounter and he was leaving to go back home in a few days so I never got to know him well, until January, when he came back for 7 weeks to do some work. After leaving we have spoken almost daily to share what his dad is doing and how well. While he was here he noticed I was having trouble with my laptop and he offered to have it fixed if I decided I wanted to. I told him no, I was willing to put up with it and we left it at that.

It is finally hitting me that I leave for Paris TOMORROW! I’ve been preparing for this trip for a while now; I originally applied to a direct exchange program that seemed a bit too academically rigorous last spring, and then I learned about the CIEE Contemporary French Studies program. I wanted to be able to travel and get to know Europe while I studied abroad, and I knew if I was too focused on school I wouldn’t be able to do that. In order to learn French better, CIEE requires that we live with a host family and have a “language buddy”, a local Parisian who wants to learn English. Though I know nothing about my host family or where I will be living, I can’t wait to move in! I meet them on Friday night after living in a hotel for a three-day orientation. Then we will have a week of French-intensive instruction, as well as a group day trip to Metz, France. Classes don’t start until January 23!

First of all you need to toast the desiccated coconut. Toasting the coconut takes it from something which is slightly bland, very dry and resembles sawdust, and turns it into something much more flavoursome and delicious. To toast the coconut, place it into a dry non-stick frying pan or skillet and heat over low to medium heat. Keep an eye on the coconut whilst you’re toasting it and give it an occasional stir to keep the cooking even and just keep it on the heat until it smells aromatic and the coconut is lightly golden

(Note: We axed the cooking plank and it was still excellent. Also, we only marinated the steaks for about 8 hours, we just started it after breakfast and pulled it out before we started preparing dinner. Also, if you need a wine pairing with it, I’m sure it’d be fine to pair it with a nice cabernet or maybe even a pinot noir, but if at all possible, you must try this paired with a sangiovese. Santa Cristina is a great bet, but Dogajolo makes a great sangiovese too. The Santa Cristina will be a bit dryer because that’s 80% sangiovese blended with 20% merlot whereas the Dogajolo is a bit sweeter because it’s 80% sangiovese with 20% cabernet. But they’re both fantastic. And if you can manage to have chocolate with it for dessert, even better.)

I still stand by all my research that gave us potential insight to the other layers of the story. I have taken my notes based on facts and information presented within the story itself not conjecture and speculation. I've always been a person whom believes in only what I can see. We all can see the layers and themes in the story and we can even entertain that some of what we saw wasn't real, again all based on the "information" they gave us.

Finding a good epic fantasy nowadays is like trying to search for a four leaf clover. Okay...maybe that's a bit exaggerated. But really, there aren't many of them. It's like we've lost our love for them. Yes, there are plenty of adult fantasy novels, but for some reason the river runs dry in the YA selection. That's why I was very excited to pick up Finnikin of the Rock. I love finding a story set in a world so far from our own I don't even get how the author came up with it.

Nothing beats getting figures from someone who can´t or won´t use them, and send him your extra figures or the occasional failed project that got you so excited once. You get OOP figures or just plain cheap stuff, without paying no third party and spending only on shipping.
Thus the plan evolved:
Whenever something terrible happens, Selma retreats into a fantasy musical world, and these are by far the most powerful and affecting sequences in the film. Von Trier makes the most of his leading lady's considerable talents, each of the songs achingly beautiful. David Morse and Peter Stormare join in with the singing too. They can't sing for toffee, but nor do they need to be able to. Dancer In The Dark is a realistic musical, its fantastical elements contrasting with the grit and realism of the story. It's quite a cruel trick by von Trier to have something horrible happen to lovely Bjork every time she starts singing.

Yes, it can be so delectable, pleasureable beyond imagination! Words that come to mind are: emanation, radiation, pulsation, serpent energy. And the feelings seem to originate in the areas nearest the spinal column. Thoughts drop away and the energy moves through the body, moving it (the body) in ways that allow for an even greater depth of feelings. Sometimes the body twists and contorts, as though squeezing the energy through every nook and cranny of the bodily cells. The physical movements of the body then become very serpent-like, undulating rhythmically. The sense I have of this is that the body and energetic field around it are adjusting to receive higher voltages of the blissful, creative energy.

That is what gets me most about the film. Diggler is a troubled child, already as low in life as one can get, with Horner as his surrogate father. Diggler runs off, is nearly killed in a hate crime attack, then comes back to Horner to live happily ever after. Or die of AIDS, which seems the more likely outcome. The end result is not the Manson family, but it is really close.

So, what have we learned today? That this movie is the equivalent of testicular cancer! There is nothing about this heinous film that I can even recommend one bit. It's awful. It's rotten, wretched goop; the absolute bottom of the barrel. Frankly, if you like this movie, I’d have to call your tastes into question. There’d have to be a good argument for any quality found in this droning, boring, bloody nonsense. I wonder if I have hateful enough thoughts about the film, like Val Kilmer did about the cops who beat him up, then my hate will be manifested into vengeance, and the film will cease to exist...well, probably not, but hey, it’s worth a shot! Now if you’ll excuse me…

I liked this movie, but I had some things that irked me about the film and I want to mention them. Overall this was an excellent movie, but I would have done some tweaking if I was the producer. I was able to read about half of the first book before going to watch this movie, so some of my thoughts might be biased. I’m not as strict as the J-man when it comes to reviewing a movie outside of the scope of the book. Although I do agree a movie needs to stand for itself, sometimes books have too much detail and a little knowledge from the books helps. It’s a fine line.

Bedtime is a funny thing for me. Now that I am an adult (please withhold the snide remarks) I have the freedom to stay up as late as I want. I know full well that if I get to bed around 9 or 9:30 that I am alert, well-rested and better able to maintain a positive attitude the following day, yet I still fight it like an elementary school kid who is worried about missing out on something.
That’s a brief summary of what has been exhausting due to my circumstances, but we’ve had several friends and family having to deal with death, illness, disappointment, and uncertainty. I don’t remember a year before where I’ve prayed this much for other people and that’s not because I made a 2011 New Years resolution to pray more.

I’m sad to say it, but I’m not sure I like monk healing. There are aspects of it that are very neat — being able to cast surging mist while channeling soothing mist, for instance — but there are too many buttons, I’ve never liked HoTs, and the mechanics seem a bit arcane. I appreciate a certain degree of complexity in DPS specs, but healing, by the very nature of the role, should be simple and user-friendly, I feel.
So here goes!

Before sex, he’d told me he was clean, and I believed him. But it wasn’t his words that swayed me. It was my gut feeling about him. It was my very own patented woman’s intuition, my internal goddamn Geiger counter that had deemed him not only safe for consumption, but worthy of chocolate cake and orchids. Repeat sex, even. A Relationship. How could I ever trust myself again? I’d let him balance the nebula of my stillborn universe on the tip his thumb, then watched as he flicked it off into the darkness, the glorious falling flare of a three-minute cigarette.
I watched the sunset in silence tonight, as if it could prepare me for frivolity, as if I could store it. There was a bright square in the midst of that glorious display. I thought, "How strange that this block of light should be suspended above all that sets...hung up, unable to pass on...another kitchen ghost with unsettled business". I tried to photograph it. After one shot, my camera said Out Of Memory. Oh man. God is speaking Annie. Pay attention. We cannot capture and hold. Life is a succession of filaments. Be aware.
Boys are monitored more closely than girls for the development of ‘appropriate’ personalities and interests, being called a ‘sissy’ has a negative value and is laced with contempt and derision. The term ‘sissy’ has feminine connotations and boys who get labelled with this term exhibit traits which boys have been taught to despise in men as they are ‘unnatural’ due to their supposedly innate femininity. These boys are thus threatened by the existence of ‘feminine’ boys and become insecure and try to prove their masculinity in the often cruel treatment of the boys who have been labelled ‘sissy’.

The following is my current tally I have been continuously questioned about by the bloggers, general public CAVE people but for some reason not ever have my clients and/or my industry asked me to produce this list. But to make it clear it is not out of my inability to provide such approximate value, give an estimate to over-all long-term economic impact or report the types of projects, it was so as to not seem arrogant. My results have been what some might say quite remarkable and some would say unbelievable, so rather than argue I just kept my statement simple, but impact. I have maintained for the past few years that my economic value to my industry has been approximately “100 projects, 50,000 jobs created and over $1B in economic impact and investment.” So after yet another barrage of naysayers and even an attack on my ethics and conduct related to my work in our industry. They even sent all my professional board colleagues a nasty set of invalid media articles from the less than the main stream media and based mainly on blogger commentaries, citing that I should be somehow ashamed of my accolades, my conduct in achieving my results, and somehow accusing me of breaking our official code of ethics. I spend 16 hours researching my historical timeline and the projects I have touched and worked on to help them achieve success. While I feel such malicious and defamatory bloggers will never be capable of accepting the truth or admitting they were wrong in their comments and accusations. Nor will any amount of disclosure or discourse sway them from their conspiracy minded thoughts. None the less, my timeline of work and career economic value using the aforementioned business case came out much greater than my much more humble previous statement of how I felt to portray a 22 year history of prolific hard work to help others find a dignified way to provide for their families.
Today is 8 weeks that Little Dude has been with his daddy and away from his drugged out mother. In 8 weeks he has gone from a sickly, underweight, scared baby to a happy, talkative, healthy little boy. In those 8 weeks he has thrived (he’s grown a whole inch!). Everyone talks about how happy he seems and carefree. A 3 year old should always appear happy and carefree. They shouldn’t be screaming and crying and making themselves vomit when they have to go back to their mother’s at the end of the weekend. At 3 life is supposed to be easy. There should not be anxiety attacks when you are 3. And at 3, a child should definitely not be mimicking smoking a bong or meth pipe.
For the same reason that warning labels exist telling people not to iron a shirt while still wearing it or to not place your cell phone in a microwave to dry it, those “Don’t” signs exist because someone in the past has done it…and usually with disastrous results.

But I’ll make the case anyway, because it reveals something that is philosophically interesting, even if it’s not practically useful. Imagine the perfect but in my view improbably if not impossible circumstances in which capital punishment is used as a fair, non-cruel and correct way of punishing certain criminals (correct in the sense of avoiding miscarriages of justice) and thereby deterring further crime. The intention of being retributive is almost impossible, even in ideal circumstances, as I have argued above, unless we give up traditional notions of cruelty which few proponents of capital punishment are willing to give up, so we can leave that aside.
Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength. A contemporary has said, not unjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people.
Chambliss, Orrin Hatch, etc. claimed, for example, that we would all suffer terribly if we were to alter the worst health care system in the civilized world, and the media presented that side of the argument as an equally thoughtful viewpoint to counterbalance the force of reason.

The topic of today’s talk—what Christ accomplished on the Cross—is of course a prime subject of contemplation during the Lenten season, as we prepare to prayerfully commemorate Christ’s passion, death, and the inevitable consequence of His death: His holy Resurrection. As we call to mind and repent of our sins during the Holy Fast, we also call to mind that which has saved us from the eternal consequences of sin. We call to mind Christ’s life-creating death on the Cross, which He underwent for the salvation of each one of us.

I know it isn't the best form to gush about a book by simply saying "OMG SQUEEEE YOU HAVE TO READ THIS @*($&*^#!!!!!" but it's hard not to do that with this book. There was a bit of buzz for this one when it first came out and, I admit, I fell in love with the cover. I finally read it when I snagged a used hardcover copy (for $3!!). All I can say is, all of the hype was completely deserved.
3. The new Bill is to be modelled on a system currently in place in the US state of Oregon where the annual number of assisted suicides has increased dramatically by over 450% since being legalised in 1997, where one in six of those dying are depressed, less than one in 20 receive psychiatric assessments and some patients have actually been denied medical care and offered assisted suicide as a cheaper alternative.

Not only did they confess their own sins but they confessed the sins of their fathers. This was also the reason that all of the foreigners were not allowed to participate in this ceremony. Israel had a sense of solidarity here. They recognized that their fathers had brought sin upon Israel and wanted the whole nation to be cured and the sins of their fathers still loomed over the nation. They recognized Israel needed healing and this extended beyond just themselves.

I think what I liked the most about Of Poseidon was how the author took a genre that has already been done many times before and created a new version all her own. Instead of calling the characters "mermaids," they are called "Syrena." Their fins aren't scaly and slippery, but velvety. They're able to change into human form when they need to. I loved discovering all the little details about the Syrena and what made them different from any other paranormal creatures I've read about before-- it made the story very unique!

After Mr. Singh’s explosive talks I was wondering how the next speaker would capture the attention of the delegates, but Mr. Siva Kumar’s thoughts on people management simply blew the lid away. His examples on people management proved beyond doubt that little things done with concern can go a long way in knitting together a committed team, and solve the attrition problem.

After getting fit I logged a 20 mile bike ride averaging 18.7 mph(@ mile 15 I was averaging 19.2!)! Not only that but the route was hillier than the routes I was riding when I was still in-season! These are numbers I didn’t think that I would hit until my 2nd or 3rd training phase of this season!!!

At first, I would describe these situations as incomoda, or uncomfortable. But that wasn’t quite the right word. It didn’t encapsulate the social hyper-awareness of it, of the moment and the persons involved. Americans, especially our youth, relish awkwardness. Our media celebrates it. We construct tents to fester in it, and turtles to swim around in it. A rather cruel side of my humor involves deliberately creating these situations to see how others react to it. A Spaniard would never think to do this.

The "last" exorcism refers to the exorcism he attempts to perform on Nell Sweetzer, a young girl cut off from the world raised in a community where nothing is as it seems.

Sam: Sam is still in denial over the extent of Corrine’s illness. Sheldon repeatedly tries to get him to see that she may require more help, but Sam is sure he can handle it, by taking time off to care for her. Corrine rapidly declines into a manic episode, obsessed with the stars and constellations she used to name for Sam when they were young, and making lunch for the entire office. Her mania increases, and when Sam tries to restrain her, she lashes out and strikes him with a candlestick. He tries to hold her back, and she ends up crashing through his sliding glass door. He takes her to the hospital, where Sheldon suggests in-patient psychiatric care. Sam is still in denial, but as Corrine comes out of sedation still delusional, it seems as though his resolve may be weakening. Hopefully Sam will become receptive before something even worse occurs.

Nehru appeared to be just as much in minority in the new cabinet as in the old. But instead of accepting political defeat, Nehru threw down the gauntlet. Addressing the Youth Congress (a misnomer even then –– most of the ‘youth’ leaders were in their 40s!) meeting in March 1948, Nehru blamed the government for ‘making brother’s hand uncleaned in fraternal blood’ warning that ‘if not with reform, the payment will be in the currency of revolution’. Ten days later, the president told the nation that he had asked Nehru to step down as the economy minister (he was replaced by Rajendra Prasad, a relatively unknown legislator).

There's an old attorney saying that they've never had to defend anyone against something that wasn't said.

I had my 26th high school reunion last weekend. What a riot that was! We had a pretty good turnout--107 people out of a class of about 200, and only a few of them were spouses! It was great to see people I haven't seen since we graduated, and some since our 10-year reunion. It was also quite interesting to find out that a BUNCH of people are local and I NEVER see them around town! What's up with that? I suppose it's because the only place you would actually SEE anyone in my small town is if you happen to catch them at the town hub: Stewart's. LOL. This place needs a pub. For real. Oh well. I've got a lot more Facebook buddies now, and hopefully we can expand the circle for the next reunion five years from now. I'm thinking we'll have to make it a weekend event, so that we have more time to visit with each other. I figured out that I only had about 3 minutes to spend with each person last Saturday. And I KNOW I didn't get to talk to everybody! *Sigh*

Every year, i enjoy watching the progression of the scultping of cheese into a fabulous cheese sculpture. Early in the Fair, the artist is there, working on the piece. We got there when she was carving part of the mild cheddar base and we got to enjoy several samples of this work of art! I asked the artist if she ever imagined that she'd be a cheese sculptor when she grew up. She laughed and said she knew she was going to be an artist but had never dreamed of worked with cheese.

God himself is a missional God. The whole Bible can be looked through the lens of Him working through the Israelites, Jesus, and Christians for the purpose of his Name being glorified above all other Gods in all nations. From Genesis to Revelation we see example after example of God using his people to do this.

This is a mighty brave statement from a girl who, this time last year, was in the midst of one of the most painful, horrific times of her life. Yep, me. I had been suspicious for some time that my boyfriend, and father of my five-month-old daughter, had been cheating on me. As a matter of fact, I KNEW he was, with every fiber of my being. I knew in the way one intuitively knows something that they cannot prove, that is. For months, my snooping had been escalating to obsessive levels. I was so desperate to prove that I wasn’t crazy AND that he was the world’s most deviant liar that I had gotten pretty creative.
Why have my hackles been raised? For two reasons: firstly, celebrity (or celebutante) authors, and secondly, a recent article pertaining to a poorly written e-book series getting snatched up for traditional publication.
I was wondering how important the communication and management between editors for a journal might be in ensuring effective and fair dissemination. I imagine that most are top down with the Editor in Chief(s) managing the bulk of the decisions. However, I suspect that some journals have significantly expanded their boards with many more EiC positions and have moved reviewing submissions to more as a panel (like many granting agencies). This seems like a pretty good idea to me but perhaps not as efficient in handling exceptionally high volumes of manuscripts.

This whole scenario reminded me of Paul and Silas in prison. “About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.” (Acts 16:25 NIV) They were beaten and thrown in prison and yet they praised God. They were singing away just enjoying themselves. They weren’t upset or downcast. They didn’t have bad attitudes were not sitting around feeling sorry for themselves. They took what was given to them and they offered praise to God. I would love to have that kind of joy. This story is just one instance where Paul lives out his conviction to be content in every circumstance. He and Silas were mistreated. They were beaten. They were thrown in jail and bound, yet they praised God. They sang to Him and as a result the earth shook and the prison doors flew wide open. God unlocked the door and they walked out. Hallelujah!

Seriously though, I've been completely giddy over the past few days with the announcements being made by Stampin' Up headoffice. It's probably best that we settle down a bit and look at some crafty goodness instead.
Coworker 2: You can pay me and I”ll try to get the key to go turn it on.
He was “talking to them” I knew it was him as soon as we walked in the door. I hollered “Shut up” he did for just a minute and then he began his mournful howling again. Far Guy said “That cannot be my dog.” News flash to Far Guy..your dog is very spoiled and he has separation anxiety.
Here is a video clip of The Tynemouth Priory and Castle.From what I can make out a guy called Frank Gillings made the video. Check his site out Tynemouth Pictures and video in the north east of England
Following the above suggestions should give you a pretty well-stocked and versatile beer selection at home. What do you think? What beers are staples in your fridge?
But that's not why Judd is our VEA Soldier of the Week. Nope, she gets the nod and perhaps a mockingjay pin of her very own for her righteous response to a flood of snarky commentary and speculation about the state of her face, which has been puffed up recently by steroids she took for a nasty sinus infection. Judd used the occasion to offer up an indignant yet nuanced reply that took on the whole machinery of patriarchy and the way that public as well as private conversations about women's bodies are used to rob them of their power and dignity by reducing their personhood "to simple physical objectification." It's a smart, fiery piece that acknowledges women's complicity in the problem. "Patriarchy is not men," Judd explains. "Patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. . . .It is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it." Sing it, sister!
The story first appeared in the June 23, 1951 issue of the Saturday Evening Post as "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms". It was later antholgized in Bradbury's collection The Golden Apples of the Sun, its title changed to "The Fog Horn", and it is by that name that it's been known ever since. My guess is that "The Fog Horn" was Bradbury's original title and that the Post editors gave it the other one; it sounds about like the magazine's style in those days. Since the movie's original working title was Monster from the Deep, I'm also guessing that Dietz first hired Harryhausen for the project, then came across Bradbury's story and decided to incorporate it, and to appropriate its title, as an afterthought. If so, then it must have been a pretty early afterthought, because the movie adopted not only the title...
Come and behold Him,
Today I've been to a Quilt Show. I found out about it from Arlene from one of the forums that I'm on. I decided to walk, and it took me 40 minutes to get there. I am glad to say I arrived on time at 10 am. The first person to greet me was Arlene. I also got a warm welcome from the Totley Brook Quilters. Great, there was a shop for me to buy some more books and some new fabrics. The ladies are also excellent cooks. So I have a lovely cup of tea and come cake. Yum Yum. Then there was the exhibition to look around. There were some lovely quilts. All different sizes and on display inside a church. As usual I had my camera ready to hand. And here are just some of the quilts that I saw.
Almost complete we finally got round to hanging the bathroom mirror which had been resting on top of the vanity only to have it come crashing down a couple of hours later and smashed to pieces, chipping out a bit of the doorframe on its way down and a little nick out of the porcelain basin......bugger! (actually that was not really the word I used, but you get the idea.) We have yet to get another mirror, but it won't be this side of xmas, a phrase which we are using alot these days.....so the bathroom even though it is the first room to be done has still yet to be signed off officially!
It's been almost an entire year since I wrote in this last. It seems crazy that it's been that long, but at the same time January feels like 10 Januaries ago, if you know what I mean.
Congrats Marlena. We'll be sending you our Guest Designer button and details on the next challenge very soon.
It was during my second month of intravenous drug use when our relationship soured and would never be the same again. Marge, the great opportunist, would try and rob something from me which I wasn't so fond of at the time but was trying desperately to keep: life.
