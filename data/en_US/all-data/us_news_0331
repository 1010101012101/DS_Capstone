Finally, if you're already in retirement and still paying off your mortgage -- with no end in sight -- don't even think about prepaying. Instead consider this radical idea: refinance to a 30-year fixed loan. You might be able to obtain a lower mortgage rate, which would boost your cash flow. And because you pay most of your interest upfront, you may pay less in taxes thanks to the mortgage-interest tax deduction.

Colvin is hitting .310 with eight RBIs as the Rockies’ primary bench player. He has five extra-base hits, including two triples, but has struck out 16 times against only one walk. He might start once a week for Michael Cuddyer in right field and much less often for the white-hot Carlos Gonzalez in left, so to play regularly he has to take time from center fielder Dexter Fowler, a better defensive option given the vast acreage of Coors Field.

“I would say yes,” Fischer said. “Though we try to limit increases and decreases. To avoid that, I look at consistency over two billing cycles.

"I thought both of them did a good job. The one thing I will say is that I don't have a problem with Derek and Billy disagreeing on some issues. I think that's healthy. I disagree with my closest friends and family about things. But I think we've got to make sure we're all together on this."
It was the last that had us on edge the most. Hudson wore a vintage silver Gianni Versace chain mail dress with a gaping neckline, and when she leaned over to the microphone, we thought, well, the FCC is about to get $500,000 richer.

Well, it soft-focuses on the period. Like "The Help," "Memphis" tells a story of racial discrimination in large part through a likable white character; you can't help wondering how big Huey's role would be if a couple of black artists had created the show instead of DiPietro and Bryan.

The next two days were filled with 20 more temple visits. It sounds like a lot, but we met a German tourist who had been in Bagan for a month and was on his 500th temple.

øSuperhuman physiques: Getting into thunder god shape is no easy task, said Hemsworth. "I remember looking at the comics and noticing that (Thor) was about four or five hundred pounds and I thought, 'Well, I can't get that big,' " he said.

I've just spent six months taking (the weight) off, and I've got to say: it's harder taking it off (than putting it on)." His go-to comfort food? "I'm a big sucker for chocolates and sweets and ice cream." And spoilers for Thor 2 were scarce. "I haven't got a script yet," said Hemsworth. "We start later in the year."

Today the story is that the Ducks, after three "preseason" games, will have an opportunity to show what they truly are about, one way or another.

The buildings of the city streets at the theme park are just facades, but the storefronts give the illusion that there are businesses that are open and attractive.

"Ultimately, it's a business," he said. "For people to say, 'Gee, it's not fair this person would come in and make this offer' is silly.

It tasted as if the kitchen had mixed up the sauces - the sauce under the pork tasted like caramel, and even the puree underneath had an unidentifiable sweetness.

Cutler threw 39 and 40 passes, respectively, in back-to-back losses to Seattle and Washington, while the Bears ran only 14 and 16 times, and fell to 4-3.

Even Rick Bayless, that hopeless traditionalist, will feature the region on the next season of his PBS show, starting next month. His meals in Tijuana, he has said many times since, were some of the best he can remember.

A starter of yellowtail presents translucent slices of fish that dissolve on your tongue, matched by pellucid shavings of radish, the ensemble sprinkled with lime and white soy sauce for an elegant, bracing dish. I expected a plate of smoked trout to be chilled, but it was wonderfully warm, blended with crème fra‹che and horseradish, accompanied by slices of potatoes, topped with a cluster of fried dill and backed surprisingly by a succulent slab of pork belly. The best single opener proved to be grilled sardines and fried artichokes in a cream sauce.

"I was sort of sitting there at the table, and it kind of dawned on me that maybe we really should sort of honestly think about making it into a series," said Hewitt, whose duties include directing and executive producing the TV show.

Admittedly, Oregon has a lot of work to do to meet the diverse needs of all of our students. And the NCLB law did accomplish one important victory in requiring schools to report achievement scores separately for various groups (i.e., African American, Latino, low-income and special education students). Unlike NCLB, however, the requirements to earn a waiver will actually help us better meet the needs of those students.

Le Pen contends the neo-Nazi label doesn't suit her and is used to discredit her party, although her National Front, founded in 1972 by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen _ convicted numerous times of racism and anti-Semitism _ has long been described that way. Experts say the party is deeply anchored in extreme-right ideology.
First match was Thursday, May 13, 2010, hosting Crystal Palace Baltimore. I was meeting a friend at the stadium, but left work too late to get a decent parking spot so ended up missing the first 20 minutes of the match. Finally get inside and went to sit with him and his pop, who goes all the way back to the NASL days. We were sitting on the 18th Avenue side when I looked over to the North End and asked, "Are they singing Christmas songs?" They were not. The Timbers Army was simply walking in a Timbers Wonderland. It took all of five minutes inside the stadium to realize I wanted to be a part of this.

My suggestion is to actually dumb it down and put it all on your players to make plays. Lean toward a man-coverage game plan, challenge your corners and safeties to cover, command your pass rush to get to the quarterback and start dialing up some of those exotic blitzes we’ve only seen in spurts. This can’t be fancy-shmancy football against Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers. It has to be old-fashioned, me-against-you defense. I’d be okay with allowing guys to play off the line and not have to jam receivers off the line. In fact, I’d tell them to be aggressive and try to jump some routes (especially CB Aaron Ross) like the Rams did when they picked off and defensed a few passes on their way to an upset of New Orleans. If your guys get beat from time to time, so be it. But trust they’ll overcome a few lost battles to win the war. It has to be done.
In February, the commission ruled that PG&E could charge customers who opt to keep their old analog meter a one-time fee of $75 and then $10 a month after that. In some cases, PG&E will need to remove SmartMeters it has already installed, and analog meters will have to be read manually.

Hunting a primitive/limited season, such as archery or muzzleloader, can also be an effective strategy, Davis notes. While most hunters opt for the trusted method of rifle hunting, the challenges of stalking wary animals within close range offers its own set of benefits.

TMM, which helps online adult entertainment companies track sales, sued Hale for defamation in 2008. As part of her defense, Hale would have to reveal a confidential source.

A trial court judge ruled in 2009 that Hale was not a journalist and therefore not afforded those protections and an in an appellate decision last year affirming that ruling, that court for the first time sought to establish a clearer definition of a journalist.

Nothing is inherently wrong with campaign-style rhetoric from the White House; George W. Bush used it repeatedly to pass his tax cuts and in his attempt at a Social Security overhaul.

When they're playing the game itself, the film is exciting and well-executed by director Gary Ross.

"King Lear" is no picnic: The play's world is one where "machinations, hollowness, treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves," as Lear's confidant, the Earl of Gloucester, puts it.

We need to get over the idea that "fair" is life's ultimate goal. If it were, we'd add up the total of government services and split the pie evenly. We don't. The rich pay more.

Somehow, what constitutes acceptable, aggressive tactics and excessive, unnecessary contact has to be more clearly defined. Athletes are taught to exploit a foe's weakness  a sore shoulder, a bad hand, a loss of foot speed.

Housing prices are still falling, with one failed government mortgage relief program after another hammering any natural recovery in the housing market.

Desktop bronzes were collected by Frick and his peers as expensive desk toys, miniature sculptures you could appreciate in private; not, perhaps, quite the same as a table-top Zen garden you can rake with a tiny fork, or an N-scale model Bugatti (all the doors work and you can lift the hood and peek at the engine!), but toys all the same.
No sooner had the Olympic celebrations ended than Tewanima returned to Second Mesa and the Hopi life he was forced to abandon.

Natalya looks a bit like Kelly Macdonald, the female lead in HBO's "Boardwalk Empire," set during Prohibition." Any further resemblance to the HBO show, or the forthcoming Ken Burns documentary "Prohibition," is a happy coincidence.
Which brings us back to DeChellis. He loves basketball at the highest levels. He talked fondly of all the spoils that come with coaching in the Big Ten: charter flights, nice hotels, raucous crowds in historic arenas, scheming to stop the 6-foot-10 forward who shoots like a guard but is built like a linebacker. It is natural for someone who grew up dreaming of basketball glory to want to reach that level.
Coach Kris Kleeman's team missed shots and mishandled the ball.

La Strada gives new meaning to dinner and a movie. The latest addition to downtown eating -- 2050 East Fourth St., Cleveland, 216-861-3663 -- is as much a movie set as it is a Mediterranean restaurant. The cinematic lighting, a mix of blues and oranges, thoughtfully illuminates the metal, wood and stucco interior. And you can tell it was inspired by Federico Fellini; the Italian master's films are projected on the walls most nights. Plus, the cuisine, a wild mix of Mediterranean and Italian, is as worldly as anything projected at Tower City. And it's only a five-minute walk from there. Rate this place a 9½.

Breivik has stated that he wanted to teach a "lesson". I hope the lesson that we do learn is that the great religions do not teach intolerance, hatred, and the killing of innocent human beings, and that a terrorist act does not define the faith of the executor. It is about time that we stop identifying terrorist attacks as "Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Hindu... terrorism". These are acts of terrorism committed by radicals and extremists. This will also help dispel stereotypes that people may have of other faiths.

Ameren's plan seems to indicate the same. According to the plan, it costs about 4 cents to save a kilowatt-hour of energy - far less than the 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to build and operate a new nuclear plant, or 12 cents for a natural gas-fired plant.
Sure, Mellencamp is from the red state of Indiana, and he wrote all of those patriotic-sounding tunes like "R.O.C.K. in the USA" and "Small Town." But when it comes to matters of the country, Mellencamp is far from nationalistic. To say the least, he's fed up.
"The post offices that they are closing down are located in the poorest parts of the city, the ones least able to use the Internet or cell phones for taking care of paying bills," said Tom Dodge, an American Postal Workers Union member from Westminster who is organizing a series of protests on the issue.

When she launched her free after-school program in this struggling Eastern Plains town two years ago, Jodi Walker didn't set out to thumb her nose at state regulations. Kids at Their Best was supposed to be something for kids in the grip of poverty to do in the afternoon besides sit at home alone or roam unsupervised. The goal was to expose them to a little art, help them find something to aspire to. Walker said she never imagined that doing all that in a rural setting would make accomplishing her goals and following state rules seem so mutually exclusive.

“We didn’t lose to the better team, we lost the game ourselves,” Covotsos said. “They hit the ball well, but we had them under control. I like our fight. We did outplay them for the last five innings, but it’s hard to come back when you’re down eight runs against a good team.”
Cooprider is no stranger to community theater, having acted in, directed and written award-winning plays.

But like many projects in government, which seemingly move like a glacier, there’s been quite a bit going on behind the scenes in anticipation of the “brick and mortar” part of this project. And like most projects in government, there are multiple agencies involved and this also adds to the time it takes to complete things.
Unpack the acronym: North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO was created in 1949 to protect Western Europe from the Red Army. Its purpose was, in Lord Ismay's famous formulation, "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down." NATO, which could long ago have unfurled a "mission accomplished" banner, has now become an instrument of addlepated mischief.

Among all the painfully underfunded programs in California, which ones should receive extra money if the state were to suddenly bring in an extra billion dollars a year? That's like asking a cash-strapped homeowner who comes into a few thousand dollars which house repair he would tackle after years of deferring the most basic projects. Replace the dying furnace or the balky toilets? How about the dangerously faulty electrical wiring?
Allowing them back on the force perpetuates a public perception of lax oversight that reflects poorly on the many brave, honorable officers who risk their lives daily.
In fact, City Attorney Rick Doyle told IA that the $553,000 doesn't include bills his office expects to receive for a series of lawsuits filed by unions since the $553,000 figure was released to the council in mid-March. He expects that will cost the city hundreds of thousands of dollars more.

"All in the Family" was among the earliest sitcoms to garner buzz for tackling serious "issues," and by season eight, the scripts played to this perception. There were more than a couple of two-parters. Depressed when his tavern falters, Archie gets hooked on happy pills. When a close friend is murdered, Edith questions her faith. Some of these themes seemed forced, but one yielded a career pinnacle for Stapleton. As family and friends gather next door for Edith's surprise 50th birthday party, she is attacked by a rapist who has been terrorizing the area. The episode shines a light on attitudes towards victims in that time; Archie initially wants Edith to keep mum, so as not to draw neighborhood gossip. As scripted, quite a few laughs are implanted in the attack, which plays oddly today. But Stapleton's portrayal of Edith's hysterics during the attack, and her post-traumatic stress afterwards, rings painfully true.

Christie has said the plan to tax the rich is a "cute idea" but the "math doesn't work." The state is still unclear on the success of a one-year increase on the income tax paid by New Jersey's highest earners.

In April, officials were uncertain whether they were in the clear.

Matheny will make his debut on the road, like four other permanent managers before him. He will not debut against Pittsburgh, like four other permanent managers did since opening day 1946. Starting with the day that Hall of Fame manager Billy Southworth left the organization after the 1945 season and Eddie Dyer inherited a team that would win the World Series, 12 non-interim managers have done what Matheny will do tonight, taken over the Cardinals. Here is how each new manager has done in his debut:

AT&T noted that the only information hackers would have been able to steal using this attack were users' e-mail addresses. But that can be enough to launch a highly effective attack, since the attacker also knows that the person receiving the e-mail is an iPad user and an AT&T customer and would expect to receive e-mail from Apple and AT&T about their accounts. Criminals could use that knowledge to trick them into opening e-mails that plant malicious software on their computers.

Carbon restrictions in the United States will add to manufacturers' costs, said Brown, a Democrat seen as essential in his party's effort to win a global warming bill.
