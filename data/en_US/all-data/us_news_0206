And because he ran a campaign that turned overly negative, Lugar turned off many of those who have long appreciated his measured tone.

Seriously, “Fright Night” is not downright awful. It simply displays nothing we haven’t seen before these days on either TV and/or the big screen.

_ WHAT WILL DEREK JETER HIT? In recent years, the Captain has become perhaps the most polarizing player in the majors. Really, try to find a single fan who stays anywhere near neutral when talking about the Yankees star. At this point last year, Jeter seemed washed up at the plate and in the field. Since homering for his 3,000th hit right before the All-Star break, he's completely rejuvenated. Manager Joe Girardi is being diligent in giving the 37-year-old shortstop proper rest, and the results appear to be showing. The call: Jeter hits a robust .321.

It may be hard to recall, now that Streep has become our thespian in chief, that her acting hasn't always been universally acclaimed.

As it relates to gas grills, the same principal applies. Ironically, I am paying the price for a bad gas grill decision right now. Last summer, I went to a big box retailer and purchased what I thought was a bargain. It had the side gas section similar to an indoor stove, and a cool infra-red searing area, and all for under $300. It was sexy and high tech. But, the beautiful green paint is already peeling, and the electric ignition switch no longer works, even after a battery replacement. I'll be replacing the darn thing within a year, and I won't be cheap about it this time. I would rather have something which lasts, and that will save me money.

I could see the realization spreading over her face like a cloud. She had often complained about not feeling good in thin-strapped summer tops at school, opting instead for t-shirts that covered more skin. "Fine," she said. "I'll wear the purple one."

Hijackers, by that point, had control of one other airliner and were about to seize two others. With initial news reports assuming that some terrible accident had occurred more than 90 stories above the streets of Manhattan, this generation's day of infamy had begun.

When most of what we know about another country comes from the news, and that news is all about diplomatic showdowns, nuclear brinkmanship and "axis of evil" labels, it's easy to forget that behind all of the politics, ordinary people are living ordinary lives not all that different from our own.
"Now it's time for Congress and the White House to move forward and focus on the long-term budget battle and our nation's crippling debt," Blunt said in a statement.

Complete data on college presidents' pay is easily accessible only back to 1991. Yet even in that relatively short span, many college leaders have seen their salaries double in inflation-adjusted dollars. Carleton's president today gets 2.4 times more than the president did 19 years ago; at NYU, pay has risen by 2.7 times. Measured another way, it takes the tuitions of 31 Vanderbilt students to cover their president's $1.2 million annual stipend. We have yet to see evidence that lofting more money to the top enhances the quality of instruction.

And that's the most wildly optimistic view. Under the government's definition, a family of four must be living on $22,113 or less to be considered in poverty even in the priciest of communities. If one uses other, more realistic standards — qualifying for the school lunch program, for instance — the percentage is much higher. Among some groups of people, it's even worse: The poverty rate for African-Americans is slightly less than 30 percent.
Considering that Stanford (48.2 points per game) and Oregon (46.0) are easily the top two scoring teams in the Pac-12, Luck was asked if there will be added pressure on the offense to gun for 50 on Saturday.

These courts have also noted that the powers the Constitution grants to Congress are limited, with some powers to make some kinds of laws left to states. These courts have reasoned that if Congress can require people to purchase insurance, it can do anything, like force people to buy broccoli because it's healthy. The Constitution cannot give Congress such broad power, these courts say.

Strawberries are the perfect fruit to grow at home and will return year after year without a whole lot of work. Just remember a few things with strawberries. They need regular watering and fresh fertilizer every few weeks. Strawberries grow best in the spring or late fall.
As worrisome as that is, it also suggests a significant flaw in "The Rogue," which is McGinniss' reliance on unnamed sources. Throughout the book, only a handful of people - including Gary Wheeler, Palin's onetime head of security, and Walt Monegan, whom she fired as Alaska's director of public safety - are willing to go on the record; everyone else is afraid of reprisals.

Ryan’s annual boast that his team will win the Super Bowl once again fell flat — and the Jets’ championship drought earlier this month celebrated its 43rd anniversary. For Ryan — same goes for Fireman Ed and any other Jets fan — who picked the Giants and Ravens to advance to the big game, this Super Bowl pits his two most-hated rivals against one another.

A: Crape myrtle trees bloom on new wood and so they need to be pruned in the winter or early spring to increase the summer's flowers. The only way to "force" it to bloom only on the bottom is to prune it inappropriately or at an inappropriate time of year. The tree should bloom all over at the same time, although it is possible the area receiving more sunlight may start blooming first.
The proposed solar farm would occupy approximately 11 acres and have 6,864 solar modules on an aluminum and steel racking system, according to documents filed with the Porter County Planning Commission.
The Nets without Dr. J were 24-58 in 1977-78, drawing an NBA-worst 4,855 fans per game at the RAC. The team moved to the Meadowlands in 1981, and while they won their first playoff series as an NBA team three years later, they arrived without star power or buzz.

"He begrudgingly found himself in an African American church on a Sunday morning – out of place, uncomfortable, and ready to leave. But he accidentally found something he wasn’t looking for: faith and prayer in action. Compelled by this experience, he began to seek out men and women across the country who 'believed', and these people became the subjects of the thirteen stories in the book. As these stories progress, two narratives unfold: Hallman’s story and exploration of faith in his own life, and the stories of the people he met."

That's the magic of theater, and it, obviously, is not confined to one geographic location. It's not even confined to certain venues on the road. For example, some St. Louisans had the chance to see Liza Minnelli's show, which won last night's Tony for best theatrical event, when it played at Lindenwood University in St. Charles. On any given night, you might find an outstanding theatrical experience at a regional theater, or at a trendy new venue, or in a church basement, or, of course, on Broadway.

The surprise for me is that the L.A. Craft has such a sense of authenticity. The menu offers a master class in contemporary American cuisine. You won't find recipes with 17 ingredients or unnecessary frills. Each dish relies on simplicity and elegance, superb ingredients and expert execution to make its point.

Kurt Warner found Faulk 12 times, and he racked up 204 receiving yards. Faulk added 54 rushing yards on 10 carries, for a total of 258 yards from scrimmage. In the process, Faulk become only the second player in NFL history to record 1,000 yards receiving and 1,000 yards rushing in a season. (Roger Craig did it in 1985 for San Francisco.)

“New Jersey forever struggles in the shadow of the New York identity,” says Peter Woolley, director of the FDU poll. With no major cities, the Garden State is often seen as a subsidiary of either New York or Philadelphia. It’s the place next to the place to visit. It can be argued that the shore, which was the No. 2 answer in the poll, is the only region in the state that is consistently recognized as having a distinct culture and character. Perhaps the subsequent appeal for a unified New Jersey is best articulated by NJ 101.5’s tagline: “Not New York…Not Philadelphia. Proud to be New Jersey!”

Marshaling the troops: Kim and Danny Provenzano show up at Danielle's house before the Brownstone benefit. (Remember? All this is to help out a little baby with cancer?) "People are less likely to attack you when in the presence of a man," Danielle explains. Yeah. Danny has invited the head of the Hell's Angels among others, to escort Danielle in. On the way in, she tells Chris, who's manning the door, how pleased she is to be able to attend. She says she calls this "a psychological F.U." And to think we thought it was good manners. Chris gets a look at Kim's fancy outfit and tells her she's in for a surprise, meaning it's a casual event, but Kim doesn't understand and relays the message to Danielle, who instantly gets her hackles up.

Key votes, including those of Sens. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., and Scott Brown, R-Mass., hung on the outcome of the talks.
Yet to some extent, bench play in the playoffs this season could be more of a factor than in the past. That is because the lockout-shortened 66-game schedule has teams playing about four games per week instead of three, which has slightly increased the injury rate. Over the first month and a half of the season, there were more than nine new injuries per day—up from seven per day during the 2010 and 2011 campaigns, according to Doug VanDerwerken, a Duke Ph.D. student who researched the topic for the analysis site teamrankings.com.

DROP OUT — There came to the writer’s notice the other day the case of a boy — by no means a bad one as boys go — who four or five years ago quit school at the end of seventh grade.

Utility, grocery and gasoline prices keep rising. The surcharges, fees and taxes on bills rise due to higher prices, including 41 percent of my phone bill. The banks raise fees, including a 35 percent increase in my safety deposit box, yet banks created the mortgage crisis and had to be bailed out by taxpayers. My income keeps dropping. I must pay taxes to bloated, wasteful and inept government entities. Politicians yammer, blame the other political party and collect campaign funds and gifts from corporations. Corporate executives raise prices and jobs overseas and exploit tax loopholes in order to collect their millions in bonuses. I am painfully aware of this maleficence, malevolence and malfeasance.

Cinco de Mayo: The holiday that the United States most widely associates with Mexico (often mistaking it for the country's Independence Day) is celebrated with far less fervor south of the border. Puebla, not surprisingly, is the exception: Cinco de Mayo is the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla, in which a ragtag Mexican force defeated a professional French army in 1862. Overlooking the fleeting nature of the victory — Napoleon soon regrouped, conquered Puebla and ruled until 1867 — May 5 became a patriotic symbol of triumph over foreign oppression. The city's annual observance, spearheaded by a massive civic parade in which even France participates, culminates in a battle re-enactment attended by rifles, cannon, swordplay, dancing, a bullfight and fireworks.

Sijbesma, chief executive and chairman of Royal DSM, recently met with The Baltimore Sun to explain how Martek will be part of the global company.
Decision on leader is crucial
The solution: A roast for $72 with new potatoes and rosemary. The more the butcher cuts, the more you pay. So a 5- or 6-pound roast costs less than individual strips but provides about 9 ounces of meat per person. And swapping new potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, olive oil and rosemary for baked potatoes means you don't have to spend on sour cream and butter.

"We're going to spread the map as far as we can for as long as we can," said Rich Beeson, the Romney campaign's national political director. "I compare the map to something like molten lava.

Some users on TripAdvisor.com and other travel websites have complained about the slow ride, but I found the drive through this fast-changing agricultural and industrial region fascinating. We drove through villages where farmers had spread out rice to dry by the side of the road and young men were lashing just-killed hogs to the backs of their scooters. Along the way, we also passed brick kilns, factories and coal mines.

Melissa says she has to avoid getting a headache, per doctor's orders. Melissa's practicing in a bedazzled neck brace, to which Maks adds a sparkly hard hat. Melissa's having a hard time with the idea of showing sexuality in her salsa. Understandable; it's going to be weird to see little Laura Ingalls all sexylike. Maks's shirt is completely unbuttoned, and, y'all, Jaleel might not have been joking - that's some serious spray tan. Melissa looks a little awkward at some points and flat out crazed in other parts - not a lot of grace from her in this routine. Bruno says it was "wild and untamed" and says she needed more control and precision and flails around a lot to demonstrate. Carrie Ann says it's great to see the confidence Melissa's gained over the competition, but adds that she agrees with Bruno about the control. Of all things, she says that Melissa might be taking steps too big for her body. Len enjoyed it overall, but it was uneven. Melissa asked Maks to put in some of the same moves from last week, to "get back on the horse."
Schultz's grand jury testimony was also read at the hearing. Most significantly, he testified that although he knew police were involved in the 1998 incident, he didn't contact them in 2002. (Schultz also testified that he didn't know much about the 1998 incident.)

“I’ve always said that I like it here and I want to come back,” said Rask, who won the job two years ago and whose abdomen/groin strain kept him from possibly taking a run at it again this season. “I think there’s a clear plan, everybody’s been talking about it. It’s not about the money. It’s about what’s good for everybody. I think we have a great group of guys, the organization is great. I wouldn’t see why anybody wouldn’t want to be here. The same for my case. I love it here. We just have to make things work, that’s all.”

One of the worst was the case of Chandler Grafner, age 7, who wasted away from starvation in 2007. Kept for long stretches in a closet, Chandler died a month after human services workers failed to follow up on a complaint from his school.
Now, the two ways to combat that are to give your tackle help, which I fully expect the Bills to do. And the other way is to run screens and draws that take advantage of upfield rushes. The Bills did a ton of that last week against the Eagles' "wide nine" look and were successful doing it. They ran screens on the perimeter and up the middle as well. They'll be doing it again this Sunday, just like the Seattle Seahawks did last week, which led to the confusion on the game-winning touchdown.
Two methods were used to determine the potential cost of the state pension systems to Ohio taxpayers by 2013.
The top needs for most of the 114 referrals to Service Connect so far are housing and employment, said Kristi Baker, the program's case manager. Being homeless, she noted, is an inauspicious way to begin turning one's life around.
Bonhoeffer's friend, Martin Niemoller, a submarine commander in World War I, found out the price one must have to pay for stalling and, in effect, enabling evildoers. He eventually turned against Hitler and was imprisoned for eight years. He wrote: "First they came after the socialists and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out, because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. And then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me."

One of the pleasures of "Hallows — Part 2" is to see how the film's production team has expanded on relatively brief passages in the book and turned them into satisfying visual splendors. One of the best comes almost at once, with Potter and friends penetrating deep below the earth on a twisting and turning journey to see what's inside the Gringotts' vault belonging to Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter). Just as good is a wild and crazy magical blaze that engulfs that Room of Requirement when a Fiendfyre spell gets out of hand.

Back in the ’70s, ’80s and into the ’90s, robust food sections were the norm, when advertising—often in double-page spreads—supported sections of 20 pages or more. Full-color covers focused on the food, luscious, up-close food you could almost grab off the page. We helped readers with shopping and cooking advice, health-food primers and price surveys. We ran columns in the ’80s on how to cope with those new tools on the market: microwave ovens and food processors.
