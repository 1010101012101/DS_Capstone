Hey, Chris: I'm certainly not going to disagree with anything you wrote about Graham. You might have added that he was President John F. Kennedy's favorite player, also, and the reason Kennedy counted himself as a big fan of the Browns (according to biographers). Paul Brown himself named Graham the greatest player he ever had and named Marion Motley his greatest back. Elsewhere, however, Brown is almost unanimously regarded as the Browns' greatest player and frequently is regarded as the greatest player in NFL history, although he finished second to Jerry Rice in a top 100 ranking by NFL Network last year.

In fact, preservatives prevent the growth of harmful bacteria on the product as it sits on bathroom counters or gets knocked around in the bottom of a purse. Consumers should be more concerned with smaller companies, whose product ingredients or manufacturing practices are unknown.

Some chaplains regarded some requests as bogus or extreme, such as seeking raw meat for a Voodoo ritual, said one chaplain. Others said some so-called religious groups were a cover for nonreligious activities, such as gangs that claim to be religious and promote violence.
Anthony is correct if not inspiring. The Knicks, down 0-2 in their best-of-seven series against the Miami Heat, are desperate for offense. In two games they've scored 67 and 94 points, respectively, and things look to be getting worse. Amar'e Stoudemire, their star power forward, will miss Thursday's Game 3 at Madison Square Garden while recovering from punching a fire extinguisher and the team is especially thin after guard Iman Shumpert went down with a torn ACL. Because of all of this, we're likely to see the return of an old Knicks staple for better or worse: Anthony doing it by himself.

He is a little like Michael Vick or Steve Young. Some scouts believe Griffin has more potential than Luck, but he probably is not as safe a pick. Griffin does not have ideal height, but he is tall enough. Griffin has excellent leadership skills. He will have to transition to a pro-style offense and learn to go through progressions.

Correcting insurance and medical records is cumbersome. Although federal law requires that providers give patients a copy of their medical records, they can charge for the service. You can ask for corrections, but only the provider that created the record has to make changes -- another provider or insurer that received false information from them has no obligation to correct. But you have the right to insist that your complaint or request for a change be included in any record.

An Australian businessman had paid $53.9 million for the flawless painting a quarter-century ago. Its private 1990 sale to the Getty, forced by the collector's subsequent bankruptcy, meant that the price the museum paid was never disclosed. (Sotheby's brokered the deal, but part of the agreement between buyer and seller was that the price would not be revealed.) The late publisher Walter Annenberg, a collector of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art who was plainly miffed that the auction house had not approached him about buying "Irises," once insisted to The Times that the Getty must have nearly matched the price the Australian paid. If so, the payout for the purchase in 2012 currency would be more than $94 million.

(Columbia) figures to be one of the premier power hitters in the Ohio Valley Conference. Thoma also has the opportunity to be one of the OVC's more complete players if he can build on what he accomplished as a junior.

* Does crowd response have something to do with how frequently WWE visits a town? Absolutely. Toronto is a perfect example. When WWE visited this past March, the first time since Smackdown’s Edge Appreciation Night in September 2011, the crowd for a live event was large (7,000-plus) and loud the entire night. Scarcity does play a factor. During the Attitude Era, WWE would visit the Toronto three-to-six times a year and of course in the 1980s, TV tapings would take place monthly. Star power and storyline interest certainly play a factor in crowd responses being steadily loud during the eras of more frequent visits (“Stone Cold” Steve Austin was being cheered by everyone in 1998, no matter how frequently a town was visited). “Starved” WWE audiences outside of North America that rarely see live events, particularly in countries that are getting WWE for the first time (Abu Dhabi a couple months ago, Russia this week, China a couple years ago) will experience unique and fully invested WWE audiences.

Eyenga -- Your guess is as good as Brown's. His only interaction with him happened in 2006 when the two attended the same Basketball without Borders event. Brown also hardly caught glimpses of his six-game stint of with the D-Fenders where Eyenga averaged 12.2 points and five rebounds in 33.0 minutes. So even if Brown plans to play him Thursday against the Kings, Brown admits he has no idea what he can offer.

The 10-year, $254 million Pujols contract is said to include a 10-year personal services provision that begins when he retires and precludes him from reconnecting with his former franchise.

The deal allows the Angels to preserve its hefty investment by keeping Pujols in the fold as they attempt to define their baseball brand.

Her story collection "Interpreter of Maladies" won the Pulitzer in 2000; but Lahiri probably is best known for the 2003 novel "The Namesake," which was made into a film.

And meanwhile, the cost of sports continues to rise. The average football squad has gone from 82 to 102 players, due to sub-specialties required by esoteric coaching strategies. The number of women's sports teams has also risen sharply. Since 1980, for example, the number of women's soccer programs has soared from 80 to 956. And teams cost money -- often lots of it. Varsity golf at Duke, open to both genders, costs an estimated $20,405 per player per year. Because there are no revenues for most sports, the deficits often have to be covered by tuition bills.

Interestingly, the researchers found that women who had previously tried some type of ART (but had not gotten pregnant) and then went on to get pregnant on their own were 25% more likely to have a baby with a birth defect compared with women with no history of infertility. In addition, women with a history of infertility – but who never tried a kind of ART – who then got pregnant on their own were 29% more likely to give birth to a baby with a birth defect.
Time lines for the project already appear to be slipping. In May, bridge planners told local officials the project could publish a final environmental impact statement by early this year. This week, plans call for a final environmental review by fall, which would allow construction to start in 2012.
Critics of the administration's efforts question the value of an individual state setting renewable-energy goals when greenhouse gas emissions and the climate change they contribute to are a global problem. Why should Maryland bother if China is going to keep building coal-fired power plants? The reason is twofold.
Both sides have suggested that the race is turning ugly, with dirty tricks and worse.
The good at this tiny place can be very good. Sitting at the counter for lunch on a weekday was a pleasure  soaking in the energy as the chefs worked so hard, breaking their focus every now and then to chat and ask how we were doing.
Of all the obstacles the new brewery has to overcome before it comes online, Zerivitz feels audience interest is the least of their worries.

"It's been heartbreaking. When I lost my mom 14 years ago, I realized at that point in my life how absolutely short life is and you're not guaranteed anything, not another day. My father and I hadn't spoken in over a year at that point, and that's when I really decided I wanted to make an effort to try to mend things," she said. "My family means the world to me, and that includes my dad, and I would never say anything negative about him or (his fourth wife) Nancy...I hope at some point he will sit down and listen to me and that we can talk this out and be a family again."
"My mother did a lot of things in this community, but she had the greatest passion and talked the most about the library," said Kendrick Melrose, 72, a former Boone High School graduate who left Orlando to earn his fortune as CEO of Toro, makers of turf and landscape maintenance equipment.
Last year in their first-round series against Anaheim, the Predators had a success rate of 23.2% compared to Anaheims 36.4% with the man-advantage. Boston won the Stanley Cup last year by converting on only 11.4% of its power plays.
The politicians who would give us $2.50 a gallon oil for a short time would be retired and prospering with their huge pensions, their big bribes from their lobbyist friends and the other multi-million dollar retirement packages that all politicians seem to acquire. We would be back to $5 or $10 gas. But what would it matter to them, they would be able to afford it!
In addition, Pops believes that the Police Department should work on developing a better rapport with teens and young residents.
Shuler’s exceptional first-step quickness allows him to be used in a variety of ways — on underneath crossing patterns and on wide receiver screens. His sprinter’s speed on deep routes gives Rutgers another weapon to stretch the field with.
By the sixth (ahem, yes, we rode it six times), we were content with rabbiting our way past the lines and becoming singletons, ready to leap into a four-seater car with someone else's group.
Architect Brent Kendle understands we all need one space that's out of view for the daily clutter we bring home. He creates what he calls drop-it spaces in every house. It's typically near the entrance to the garage, so homeowners can walk in, put down their cellphones and mail before cluttering up the kitchen counters -- or worse, dragging it all into the living room. We think these out-of-sight organization niches should be mandatory -- like bathrooms!
"I think people forget that there's no substitute for blood," she said.
The guinea pigs here are three people trapped in a rundown factory, a creepy forest and an abandoned carnival, and if you get stuck in one level you can switch to a different character. With dozens of puzzles, there's enough here to challenge even the craftiest gamer. But even players who don't make it all the way through "Closure" will relish its nightmarish images and eerie soundtrack. Three stars.
“Martell kept telling me the whole time,” Love said. “Martell kept mentioning it to me.”
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the trans-Hudson River commuter train system, announced Monday that the pilot program will start June 10 and run through July 10.
She said after she resigned last year -- a step that came as the phone-hacking scandal exploded beyond illicit news gathering into revelations of complicity in the political and law-enforcement establishments -- Prime Minister David Cameron and other leading figures sent her sympathetic messages through third parties. Freed on bail, she cannot answer direct questions about cases under investigation for fear of prejudicing a future trial.
Superstition and frustration also play a role in bat selection. If a player is slumping, he will often try a teammate's bat. If it works -- meaning, he starts hitting -- he will keep using it. Rockies' outfielder Carlos Gonzalez ended up using pitcher Esmil Rogers' bats last week after CarGo broke several over the season's first few games.

But when it comes to the market for premium space, the universe covered in the Jones Lang report, conditions are different. Vacancies are declining, rents are rising and choices of prime offices have become more limited.
Book authors wonder about long-form writing in an attention-deprived world, publishers fret about revenue models as bookstores disappear, and consumers develop new reading habits that include both electronic and printed books.
The track, which carries about 40 trains a day, cuts off the northern part of the city from the historic downtown and the commercial growth around Arbor Place mall. Tractor-trailers trying to scoot over the tracks at the steep grade crossing at the Broad Street intersection can get hung up, forcing even longer delays if the train has to stop.

KI'm Mayer: Is the rumor mill true that this is the last season for Army Wives when it returns in the spring?
This fractured world view, Jones and others argue, leaves too many people focused on narrow slices of a vast and common challenge, and gives no one a portfolio to speak for the whole region. It makes it easy to ignore problems a few towns over, said Christine Chadwick, executive director of the civic advocacy group Focus St. Louis, or to move to another school district instead of working to fix your own. And it makes it hard to know even whom to approach with an idea or a donation or help to start a business.
Part of the site will be closed this year for rebuilding work. The site will be completely closed to public use for most of the 2013 construction season.
potted plants almost every night? I have tried various hot peppers and covered the dirt with sweet gum balls ... they love both apparently. They are so destructive. What can I use to discourage them from this behavior?
This year, the owner of a Florida wildlife rescue center lived in a cage with two lions for a month as a fundraising ploy to keep the facility afloat. In San Antonio, the Wild Animal Orphanage folded last fall "due to overpopulation, under-funding and inadequate housing for the animals," according to its website. It took months to place several hundred tigers, bears, lions, cougars, wolves and primates.
The Enterprise and three other shuttles in NASA's fleet were sought by several cities as potent symbols and tourist draws. In the end, New York beat out places like Houston, which has ties to the space program.
Mansfield, who oversees Apple divisions that produce iPhones and laptops, products that helped make Apple the world's most valuable company, is navigating native objections and the county's often-tricky permit process with the help of a raft of consultants. He has so far produced a historic review, an archaeological review, a biotic review and a geologic review and more.
And as Cordray will soon learn, that's not a good place to be.
Of course, so is ignoring your kids. But let's assume you're not doing that. Let's assume your 6-year-old is getting ample attention and just can't fathom why you'd have a conversation without her.

A: We live in unprecedented time. There is very soon going to be more older people than younger. It's not simply that we're getting older, we invented chronic illness (with many people receiving care long beyond what may be needed). American health care is a disease system and we train doctors to treat disease today.
"The Elephant Man," April 12 –May 5. Pomerance's moving play based on the real life story of John Merrick, tells of a 19th-century outcast whose fine mind and sensitive spirit are trapped inside a body hideously deformed by illness. The play shows how Dr. Frederick Treves rescues Merrick from a life of freak-show exhibitions and strives to help him live with dignity. First seen off-, then on Broadway, the offbeat drama became a Tony-winning hit, with many subsequent regional mountings, also inspiring an Oscar-winning film.
"I never wanted my kids to feel left out because I spent so much time with Kilo," Negrea explains. Instead of seeing Kilo as a rival, the Negrea children came to regard him as family, as did Negrea himself.
In 35 of their 66 games, the Clippers have been either down by up to five points, or tied, with five minutes left in the fourth quarter. They have won 16 of those games. (The Lakers, interestingly, are 17-12 in those games.)

"He's the guy who influenced my whole turnaround," Webb said. "He's the one who gave me the confidence that I could still make it. You need somebody like that in your life, and sometimes I try to be that same guy to kids. I made it harder on myself. It was harder to make it to the NFL from a smaller school, and it taught me if I wanted it bad enough, I had to step my game up."
Critics of the rule say relatively few borrowers will be able to obtain the less costly, gold-standard mortgages. Around 46% of all homeowners with a mortgage had less than 20% equity in their homes at the end of 2010, according to CoreLogic Inc., a real-estate data firm.
"The message is clear. We know we can play better as a team. I think we'll see a different group of guys next game."
To be fair, there wasn't much spin put on Rolle's comments. He was upset with the way he was portrayed because he felt he was the only one who played things properly. He came down to play the hook area in a Cover-3, while Webster also stayed short in a Cover-2 look. That left the deep left side of the defense wide open.
"It's humbling and it puts things into perspective," Belanger said of Talley's decision. "From his point of view, he could've taken care of himself by paying for rent or something with that money."
These days, you don't need to look farther than your morning cup of coffee to find a cupcake -- Starbucks has introduced two flavors to its bakery lineup. But if it's something more creative you seek, whether for a special occasion or an afternoon snack, there are many options to suit your fancy. Here are a few:

Later in the day, Muti recalled that in 1989, when he conducted Verdi’s “Requiem” in Moscow, the audience responded as if it were having a religious and spiritual experience. The Iron Curtain was still up, he noted, and “the music gave them freedom.”
Walker's campaign spokeswoman branded Barrett as a two-time loser who failed to turn around Milwaukee's economy, noting that he also lost in the Democratic primary for governor in 2002.
Retired Appeals Court Judge Jack Davies said he has lobbied for bringing back a parole board. Instead of everyone serving at least two-thirds of his sentence behind bars, Davies believes offenders should be eligible for parole after serving a third of their time. Using ever-improving risk assessment tools, a board could make the decision about who is an appropriate inmate to bring into the community early, he said.

It was also good practice for her career in law, where she would find herself among the first women breaking into the field.

"I don't think the number is as important as how we're regarded in terms of quality of life, talent of work force, affordability and the business climate," said Dick Fleming, chief executive officer of the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association. "Even if we had gone up to No. 16, our customers, which are not only the companies but the 200 or so site selection consultants out there, put much more of a premium on these kinds of things.
"My whole goal is to stay sober and to do everything in my power to never have a relapse. I'll do whatever it takes. My employers, fans and family have to have faith in me that it can happen. I'd love this awful situation I put myself in to be a story of redemption, to the extent (that) somebody got their life back together.

Figures from the National Counterterrorism Center show that successful attacks by Al Qaeda have dropped 16% in the year since Bin Laden's death compared with the year before, according to an analysis released this week by the Center for American Progress in Washington.
"It's definitely been heartbreaking," she said. "When you're a freshman, everything is really new for you, so the tournament was new for the four us that were there. But each year you learn. They say that a championship team needs to know how to win a championship game, and I think that it's really true."
“He was talking to me about his wife and how she was cheating on him,” said Wilkes, who was 13 years old at the time. “He was just saying how she got a new boyfriend and how he didn’t want to leave her…He said he was going to have to deal with it.”
In December, Chan-Stuckart filed paperwork with the state's Division of Liquor Control that said Ward no longer had any involvement with the operation of the nightclub, and therefore, its liquor permit should be renewed and allowed to be sold to Hayes. A lawyer for Chan-Stuckart was even more emphatic in a legal motion filed Jan. 21.

E15 still needs to clear some final regulatory hurdles and a pending court challenge.
"This was too close, too close," said Italo Arienti, a 54-year-old sailor who has worked on the Maregigilo ferry service that runs between the island and the mainland for more than a decade. A now-retired Costa commander used to occasionally do "fly-bys" on the route, nearing a bit and sounding the siren in a special salute for his hometown, he said. Such a fly-by was staged last August, but there was no incident, he said.
The anorak illustrated here is by Brian Wolk and Claude Morais of Ruffian. It's part of the American sportswear movement affecting fashion on both sides of the Atlantic, and I especially like this version because it's not just a 2010 update in nylon or weatherized cotton. As the designers told me, "We were inspired by traditional American sportswear and wanted to rework this classic in a luxurious fabric -- one to be worn in a sophisticated urban context." That fabric is a lightweight mohair the designers say they discovered while traveling in France. For store information, contact or write to Ruffian at 306 W. 38th St., 16th Floor, New York, NY 10018.
Gefilte fish: A blessing for the cook. If your refrigerator is large enough, you can plate the gefilte fish before the seder. If your seder is short enough (say, under an hour), you can plate the gefilte fish and leave it on the counter covered loosely with plastic wrap.

But for entirely different reasons, the future of the trigger movement is very uncertain right now. Shortly after the pioneering California law was passed -- allowing parents to force one of four reforms at low-performing schools if half or more of them signed a petition -- it looked like copycat laws would sweep the nation. That hasn’t happened.
Initially this technique produced characters that were dead-eyed and kinda creepy, but fortunately the technology has improved enough that by "The Adventures of Tintin" the characters are downright lifelike.
Separate from that, or in addition to that, when the Congress will not act, when Republicans block important things that need to be done on behalf of the American people, this President will act, because we can't wait. And this is very much a part of that approach. He's appointing Richard Cordray today because we cannot wait. The American people cannot wait.
Gay rights: Opposes legal recognition of same-sex marriage and says it should be banned with a constitutional amendment, not left to states. "Marriage is not an activity that goes on within the walls of a state." Also opposes civil unions "if they are identical to marriage other than by name," but says states should be left to decide what rights and benefits should be allowed under those unions. Says certain domestic partnership benefits —largely unspecified — as well as hospital visitation rights are appropriate but "others are not." Says he would not seek to restore the ban on openly gay military members. Asserted in 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor that "all citizens deserve equal rights, regardless of sexual preference," in tune with statements years earlier as a Senate candidate that equality for gays and lesbians should be a "mainstream concern." But did not explicitly support marriage recognition and, as governor, opposed same-sex marriage when courts legalized it in Massachusetts. "My view is that marriage itself is between a man and a woman."
The Oregon women are No. 1 ranked by the USTFCCCA and are defending NCAA indoor champions. The UO men won the 2009 NCAA indoor title.
Isakson slammed her head against a metal chair arm and on a metal frame beneath a passenger seat, according to the claim. It says she lost consciousness, a pool of blood surrounded her head, and she was seen "frothing at the mouth."

James never demonstrated any such affection. Those who viewed him as a Clevelander were blinded by adoration.
By insisting that errors of the head be punished, the message to the rank and file is to hesitate the next time — and you too can be among the "honored fallen." But a dead officer is not honored fallen; he has had his life unexpectedly ripped away, leaving family members behind.
Over the past two decades, the study said, disparities in health indicators such as mortality from traumatic injuries have worsened for vulnerable populations.
"Where does stuff come from and where does it go? That is a good organizing principle," said Carolyn Chase, CEO of San Diego EarthWorks, the organization behind San Diego Earth Fair. "One of the biggest things you can do is leave things cleaner than you found them. If you look at the world that way, you can't go wrong."
Ambrose said he began to discuss the new contract with Waddell early in the season but had to put discussions on hold as the Tigers were making their run to the school's first playoff since they were a Division II team in the mid-1980s. Ambrose has much higher aspirations for the program now than he did a year ago.
With the additions of Delaney and hurdler Jonathan Cabral of Agoura, Calif., it's clear that UO coach Vin Lananna and men's associate head coach Andy Powell are building a broad-based team, and not one that is tied to a distance-throws model.

Local backers believe that Northeast Ohio remains the frontrunner. They cite public financing in place since 2007 -- courtesy of an increase to the Cuyahoga County sales tax -- and other factors, such as a renowned, built-in medical industry that can drive business.
Supporters argue that servicing standards are critical to fixing the housing market and that the foreclosure mess is too dire to wait for the federal rule-making process or, even worse, Congress.

In typical Betty Ford fashion, she has done it all in full public view. "Well, you know, that's just the way I am," she says. "In my usual vocal way, I've always told everybody what I was going to do."
The open-records law, or OPRA, was designed to give citizens clear rights to examine such state and local government documents as contracts, payrolls, meeting minutes, budgets and correspondence, and it set a response time of seven days. But requesters often don’t get what they seek, experts said.

"Cleveland is America," he said, everything he dreamed of.
Although Daldry takes us to unglamorous neighborhoods in the five boroughs, the denizens of the city are as kindly as the caricatures in a tourism ad. "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close" is supposed to promote healing, but as they say in New York: close, but no cigar.
"I wanted a new experience. I will miss Akron, but hopefully I can come to Arizona and create new things and build on that."

The Indians acquired Cabrera from Seattle for Eduardo Perez on June 30, 2006. He made his big-league debut in 2007 and helped the Indians reach Game 7 of the American League Championship Series.
As Spears' vocals cut out, the track builds to a climactic "breakdown," signified by dubstep's trademark bass wobble. It's deep enough to crush your chest, and it's a huge part of what makes the genre so appealing: A song builds and builds until the rug is suddenly ripped from under it, only to re-form. It's dance music that constantly rewards listeners with its ebb-and-flow design.
"One thing that distinguishes us from our peers around the country is our willingness to experiment," Feldman said. "If it doesn't work, we can put things back. There are no broken bones here. It's safe."
A change of tune: Gov. Jerry Brown got quite the reception this week at the California Chamber of Commerce's 86th annual Sacramento Host Breakfast, where he talked about the state budget. That friendly treatment included an enthusiastic standing ovation as the Democrat left the stage exclaiming, "We'll make it work if you just follow my lead!"
Of the Democrats’ 120 candidates, 32 belong to minority groups: 19 African-American, 10 Hispanic and three Asian-American. That’s seven more than in 2007 — the last time all seats in the Assembly and Senate were up. Many are incumbents, but Democrats have a reasonable opportunity to pick up five more minority-held seats.
In the campaign's final days, Obama Cabinet members voiced support for same-sex marriage and former President Bill Clinton lent his voice to robocalls opposing the amendment. Evangelist Billy Graham, 93, has been featured in full-page newspaper ads backing the gay-marriage ban.
Hogwash. Yes, using neutral-seeming barriers to deny blacks a real chance to vote was central to Jim Crow — but for a generation now, the nation’s assigned an entire division of the Justice Department precisely to jumping on top of any such chicanery.

Rusty Smith replaced Young on Sunday and Fisher said the rookie will start next weekend against Houston. The Titans are bringing in Chris Simms to back up Smith. Veteran Kerry Collins is expected to start once his strained left calf heals enough for him to play.
But the vaccine, which protects against what doctors prefer to call the 2009 H1N1 flu strain, will not arrive all at once. About 45 million doses are expected by mid-October. That is why the government wants the people most likely to catch swine flu, and to suffer complications from it, to be first in line -- including children and pregnant women.
“We got close with a big home run by Heisey,” Baker said. “I think it is the first opposite-field home run of his career. We missed Heisey big time.”

1. Don't pick a bad date. Of course you could pick Super Bowl Sunday for your wedding, but don't be surprised if some of the groomsmen look a little, um, distracted during the ceremony. Trust us, your guests will be way happier if you avoid major holidays or national events where they might already have plans.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Evanston needs no introduction. She's one of the more partisan members of Congress, but in much of the 9th District it's considered a compliment to be called "a Jan Schakowsky Democrat." For those who think Schakowsky is too conservative, there's Simon Ribeiro, 30, also of Evanston.

San Francisco Sex Information is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization founded in 1972, providing one-to-one answers to anonymous sex questions via phone, 415-989-SFSI (7374). Many of the Monday night crew have staffed phone lines and trained new staff about everything sex-related under the sun for over a decade; their Web presence garners most of the questions these days, and while we're pretty much bathing in sex information here in San Francisco, SFSI's email comes in from everywhere from the Middle East to South America; from India to Indiana. They're vastly different from other sexual health institutions for a lot of reasons at SFSI, but mostly that they're one of the only anonymous resources that provides answers about sex to all comers that has no agenda -- their message isn't birth control (like Planned Parenthood), or changing people's sexual behaviors, but rather just providing accurate information to anyone who asks.
