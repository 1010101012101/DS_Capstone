If the number of approximately 8,000 is correct, Cuyahoga has far too many workers for its size. (Allegheny County has around 5,500.) A 25 percent reduction would put Cuyahoga County at the median of employment among counties of similar size and would result in a significant lowering of cost of personnel. The pushback will be that you should not cut jobs when you have high unemployment. Nevertheless, the purpose of government is not to provide employment but rather to provide good and efficient services. Requiring taxpayers to fund more jobs than is required to meet this standard is not a good government practice.

Ducks coach Chip Kelly is a brilliant football mind and a great quote. But he wasn't accustomed to the complexity involved in running a major college football program when he took over at Oregon. Those working in the football offices say the program abandoned protocol and felt "wild west." Kelly didn't delegate responsibly, either -- hold up, the head football coach was texting and calling a low-level scouting wanna-be?!? -- and the result now is an inquiry.
"At least now we know the path we have to take," he said. "It's better to know than it is to be waiting."
The market, according to Panatier, is served by two water systems, so its businesses were able to stay open. Only Starbucks was left without water.

The Buckeyes, by contrast, were putting up video game scores -- averaging 90.4 points per game without a 3-pointer or a shot clock in the 1960 championship season and hovering in the mid-80s in the next two runner-up seasons.
Schurick and his defense team had portrayed the robocall as a mistake — a hastily hatched plan to encourage "crossover" black voters to head to the polls to vote for Ehrlich — and put prominent politicians from both political parties on the stand to vouch for his character. Pettit called the robocall a "faux pas" that wasn't criminal.
It's all here: The psychology of the layout, the behind-the-scenes decisions about what odd mix of products to carry, the science of the pricing and the views of loyal card-carrying members who embrace a trip to Costco as more than an errand-- an adventure.
Medical technology seems to have outstripped our ability to handle the emotions around the inevitable. When the technology, and the people who wield it, hold out even the possibility of a "successful outcome" it is so very hard to see the bigger view and make the best choices for those that we love and care about -- so often we just want to keep them well and close to us. Letting go is very difficult indeed.
Supervisor David Chiu presented mayoral certificates of honor to both North Beach Citizens and Etheredge for their work with the neighborhood's homeless community. And SFPD Deputy Chief Jim Dudley had a special treat for his longtime pal.
Dorothy Marcic adapted the show from her book, "Respect: Women and Popular Music," and it has evolved over more than a decade into an exuberant, flashy and musically incoherent medley of rock, pop and Broadway standards that uses lyrics to show women's progress from dependence ("Someone to Watch Over Me," "I Fall to Pieces") to freedom ("I Am Woman," "I Will Survive").
Not one bit of that matters to Miocic. He's focused on moving up in the UFC ranks and getting a shot at dos Santos. Provided, of course, dos Santos can survive a battle with No. 1 contender Alistair Overeem, whose beat-down of Brock Lesnar prompted the immediate retirement of the former WWE wrestling champ.
Since Pittsburgh is only a little less than four hours, the Mountaineers massive home-court advantage is neutralized a bit. So is Kevin Jones by Jared Sullinger. Ohio State, 69-60.
Finally, at the company's Dec. 15 holiday luncheon, Roth handed Kralik a box tied with a big red bow. She said celebrities had roads and buildings named after them, but she thought he might appreciate an even tastier tribute.

"The Harvey Police Department takes the identified deficiencies very seriously," Eaves said.
The final women's costume literally covers everything from head-to-toe, including a marble-print skull cap, long gloves and shoe covers. Even her exposed face and neck are covered in white makeup that has gray lines drawn on to resemble cracks. But there's nothing dowdy about this surreal disguise. She is wrapped in flowing garments, but the empire waist highlights the best of a feminine shape.

PW Pizza opened this year. It's the newest restaurant from Paul and Wendy Hamilton, the "P" and the "W" in the pizzeria's name. Their first restaurant in the neighborhood was Eleven Eleven Mississippi, which is around the corner. PW Pizza takes up much of the first floor of what was once the malt house for the Joseph Schnaiders Brewing Co., which was one of the top three breweries in St. Louis in the 1870s. The late-Victorian building is now on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hamiltons have filled it with Vin de Set, an upscale bistro with a rooftop bar overlooking downtown; Moulin and the Malt House Cellar, venues for special events and corporate meetings; and Grand Petite Market, a small kitchen store.

Some affected babies also have breathing problems, low birth weights and seizures.
You don’t? Lucky.
So that's why Jenkins' presence is so significant. Despite 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh telling reporters Thursday that the team had no "glaring need," the Jenkins pick was a supply-and-demand revelation that tells us a lot about the 49ers' view of their receiving stockpile.
"Just to be a part of it makes me feel pretty special," she said.
The third quarter was pure misery for the Bulls, who were outscored 36-14. The Sixers shot 68.2 percent from the field and built an 11-0 edge in fast-break points during the quarter. Philadelphia started the second half on a 19-4 run and when the Bulls got back within 70-66, the visitors added another 13-3 surge to finish the third quarter with a 14-point lead.
Ehrlich said he could not comment on his aide Paul Schurick and the consultant Julius Henson being charged with violating election law by issuing robo-calls that prosecutors say attempted to suppress black turnout in Baltimore and Prince George's County on election night. On the calls, a woman says voters should relax and not worry about going to the polls because O'Malley and Obama "have already been successful." Attorneys for Henson and Schurick have said their clients are innocent; Ehrlich was not accused of wrongdoing.
Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are recorded when they are incurred rather than whey they are paid. That better reflects the costs for liabilities such as pensions and health insurance.

Jerome Wallach, an attorney for MB St. Louis, argues that the building's value plummeted because AT&T has slashed the size of its workforce there, and low occupancy cuts the building's market value. The owner would have difficulty selling the half-full building for an attractive price when AT&T's lease expires in 2017, he added.

Next, we walked through two doors and into Blues Hall's sister establishment, the Rum Boogie Cafe. Everything was bigger: the room, the noise level, the band. James Govan and the Boogie Blues Band kept everyone moving with familiar song after song: "In the Midnight Hour," "Wonderful Tonight," "Green Onions," "Brown Eyed Girl."
"I like to move slowly, reaching goals they can reach without getting discouraged," she said, "maybe five or 10 percent of their weight, then set another goal from there."
"There is a time frame, so you don't race your horse," said Turrin. But completing within the time frame is only the first step. Horses are evaluated before the ride on everything from their heart rate to soundness. They start with 100 points and the placings are determined on their condition when they undergo the same exam after crossing the finish line, with points subtracted for less than optimum marks in each category. So a horse who comes in behind four others, for instance, could win if he has the most points.
The public records litigation has underscored a continuing battle between the authority and the privately owned Prudential Center in Newark. Officials at the authority say Prudential is looking to shut down the Izod Center at any cost.

What it would cost: The tax would increase from the current rate of $1.35 per $1,000 of assessed property value to $1.60, for a total of $320 annually on a property valued at $200,000. That is $50 more than the same property owner pays now. The city expects the tax would bring in $10.8 million over the next five years.
Mind you, this was a week after Teva Neurosciences announced it was relocating its headquarters and 400 jobs from Kansas City to Overland Park, thanks to hefty Kansas tax incentives. But Fullerton gets a pass on that one.
We love the smell of AquaNet in the morning. And happily, Beck is concluding its 2010-11 season with "Hairspray," the 1960s rock musical set in Baltimore. Beyond all the bouffant hairdos and rollicking fun, the play has a serious core involving racial integration.

“People need to understand that it’s not just about appearance, it’s an economic issue,” Dellaquila noted. “Every time I have to pull my people off tasks they’re currently working on to go paint over this stuff, it means something else is not getting done, or it means delays in completing other assignments. That affects the service we provide to the residents of Bridgeton as well.”
Hamels says things like, "I'm getting ready, trying to prepare myself for it as much as I possibly can, and we'll see what happens." He says that one of the effects of meeting Phils veteran pitcher Jamie Moyer has been the ability to learn more about work ethic and workout techniques. Hamels says:
"There were no actual or estimated meter readings and related billings for numerous new accounts, in both Baltimore City and Baltimore County, for several years after the meters had been installed," McCarty wrote.
Another version of how the town got its name is credited to Stella Nau, who told the story that during the first year or so after C. Tustin bought the land people would refer to it as Tustin's land or they would say, "See Tustin if you wish to buy property," thus conveying to the hearer that the name of the place was Tustin. They came looking for a town called Tustin and gradually the settlement became known by that name.
"It was like walking back in time with all the old furniture, the old architecture, the peeling paint, medical equipment and beds," Aspell, of Lexington, Mass., said of the August road trip. "Then there are the tunnels. I love tunnels."

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is threatening to come down hard on teams leaking Wonderlic scores and other private information. This was in response to reports about LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne scoring a 4 out of 50. Did he take the test seriously? Did he panic? Does he have a reading disability? There's no context, just a score that invites interpretation and ridicule.
The seven defendants are held on bonds of $2 million to $3 million, facing charges ranging from first-degree felony murder to possession of marijuana. They are scheduled to appear in Superior Court today for an initial-status conference.
Despite her mild disappointment with the Black Friday sales, she bought two laptops, a camera and a lens.
Cavaliers fans have loved watching their lithe rookie twist, turn and crossover dribble his way to one spectacular driving layup after another. But think of how many times Irving crashes to the floor en route to a basket. Former Cavaliers guard Mark Price probably sees the SportsCenter highlights and his hips begin to ache instinctively.
"I don't think doing the selfish record thing would help next week," Eaton said, looking ahead to the main part of the Pac-10 when he could find himself in the long jump, the hurdles, the 100 meters and/or one or both relays.
The 3-mile-wide strip along the 360-mile coast is home to kelp forests, pinnacles and rocky reefs hosting hundreds of species, from rockfish to giant sea anemones to octopus. Only eight of the 43 groundfish species in Oregon's near shore have been assessed. Two -- yelloweye rockfish and canary rockfish -- are considered overfished.
Now the politicians have elevated this form of theft to a new level by lying to the people they represent about "giving" them a tax break by letting them stop contributing to the Social Security fund for some period of time. The only bright spot in this scenario is that it at least will keep the politicians from stealing these contributions for pork barrel projects. Of course, no money will build up in savings, as there will be no contributions. Meanwhile, the pols are sure to promise more from a bankrupt system to new and different factions, whether or not they have ever contributed to it.

But Bill Davis, a Siemens sales account executive, said neither he nor the company paid for the air conditioning work -- estimated by the consultant at more than $21,000 -- and they never intended to pay. Davis said the consultant recommended talking to a Siemens subcontractor about window units for Phillips-Olivier's home on Cleveland's West Side.
Also, while no one would confuse the ragged sincerity of films like Lynn Shelton's "Humpday" and "Your Sister's Sister" with David Wain's absurdist comedies "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Role Models," when both directed recent episodes of "New Girl" the final products were relatively indistinguishable, with the personal, defining characteristics of their films steamed out by the smooth machinery of television production.
Phillips is exploring a number of options. He could end up moving to SMU to join June Jones' staff. Co-offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said after the game that he will be joining Sumlin's staff at A&M.

The mission of the job center has been to identify strong sectors of the economy and to put stimulus money to work there. The result was a focus on health care, which has been a national bright spot throughout the recession, and local manufacturers with ties to aviation and military contracting.
But Greater Clevelanders, especially, and Ohioans in the Toledo and Youngstown regions, know the turnpike as a vital, well-maintained artery for commuters, travelers and freight. Justified or not, a common fear is that a private operator of the turnpike would be more inclined to boost tolls, and less inclined to maintain the superhighway, than the Ohio Turnpike Commission is.

For a team that prides itself on defense — and played crisp baseball through most of spring training — the Rockies are off to a rocky start at 1-3. They committed three errors Saturday in a 7-3 loss at Houston. The next day, third baseman Jordan Pacheco's throwing error in a 3-2 loss to the Astros was a killer mistake that allowed the tying run to score with two out in the eighth.
While total restitution will be determined later by O'Malley, Russo will have to forfeit $225,000 from his state pension, which totals $390,000. After payment of taxes and other debts the amount turned over to the government will be $155,000.

Don't include me in the chorus of those who claim that the schools are somehow "underfunded," even as K-14 education consumes more than 40 percent of California's general-fund budget – not to mention all the local bond measures and federal funding.

The NFLPA player family joins with the Seau family to mourn a brother lost too soon."

allowed to wear rosary's to school. On balance, that is a good thing. I'm sure defining gang symbols is an ever-moving target, but discerning a person's faith commitments is pretty straight forward. If the boy had other factors that might have identified him as a gang member, then the school might have a case. But I know a lot of people who wear religious emblems of one sort or another. Jewish students should not be penalized for wearing Stars of David, nor evangelicals for displaying crosses or WWJD bands, or Presbyterians and our ubiquitous camp shirts.

A recent report by ProPublica and the Columbia Journalism Review identified a host of ways in which the administration is making it harder for the public to access records heretofore more readily within reach. The Department of Energy wants to eliminate a rule that allowed it to release documents if it concluded that they would serve the public interest. The Department of Education has expanded its authority to refuse release of materials even after they are redacted to remove students' names and identifying information. Other agencies are raising fees for processing and copying. The Securities and Exchange Commission wants to charge $70 an hour for processing some requests -- not that anyone would want to study the efficacy of regulation and enforcement in the stock market.

The region had seen just more than half of the average year-to-date rainfall as of April 17, five inches short of the normal 12 inches. The 6.78 inches of rain so far this year would rank as the third-lowest rainfall on record if it stood at the end of the month. A drizzly system moving through the area Wednesday wasn't expected to add more than a tenth of an inch, but solid chances for heavier rain Saturday and Sunday could help.

You know what's disheartening is that once again this is another year where we don't get any love or support from our network. Now the show is doing great in the ratings. Over the course of the last six or seven years, they've put seven different shows in our time slot and none of them have performed as well, yet they're once again pulling us. We're going to go away after about a month, and they'll bring us back in May for another seven or eight episodes. They do that to us almost every year.

Maybe it's time to face facts, the Angels' coaching staff has to be replaced. Mike Butcher is a joke, Mickey Hatcher is no longer a joke, just pathetic, and Mike Scioscia is lost.

Newbie says: My preference is starting to sway heavily toward the dry side, away from this sloppy-wet St. Louis mess. These ribs were all sauce, which maybe wasn't a bad thing because the actual meat wasn't good: plain, white, unsmoky pork. Best to eat it quick, partly because you're doing so on a parking lot but also because the sauce soon looks like Tabasco cut with grease.

His senatorial going-away present to us was Dodd-Frank, formally known as the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a massive compliance nightmare that stands forbiddingly athwart hopes for economic recovery.

The city auditor, in a report last September, said the city does not have a precise accounting of the condition of its water pipes, and because inspecting lines is so expensive "it is generally considered to be more cost-effective to simply fix lines when they break."
The child tax credit would be cut in half to $500 per child. The dependent care credit would end and the tax for heirs would be reinstated. This year there is no estate tax, but if Congress does not act, it goes to 55 percent on Jan. 1 on property in excess of $1 million.

VIA Rail Canada, on the other hand, does run promotions; the best are some fantastic "Express" deals, typically covering trips up to a month in advance, so "wait for a deal" strategy seems best here. Similarly, Rail Europe and similar agencies often run promotions on railpasses, again with a fairly short purchase window.

However, as one senior official said this week, the ECB could contribute not by taking a loss—but by "forgoing profits." That would mean devising a mechanism to take the bonds off the ECB's balance sheet at the prices at which it bought them.

celebrate the successful accomplishment of the mission of eliminating the leader of Al Qaeda, we should not lose sight of the reality that this philosophy is much deeply rooted in many parts of the world. For long time when we were not even sure if Osama Bin Laden was alive or not, the consensus among the analysts was that the "Bin Ladenism" has spread in many countries and the splinter groups are either loosely attached to Al Qaeda or totally independent. How strong the organization is now, remains a very important question. Unfortunately there will be reprisal and innocent people will pay the price with their lives in many parts

How'd that play out against the Pistons? They were 6-of-12 in the first half, 5-of-6 in the third quarter and 11-of-14 in the fourth. To me, this shows that the foul shooting problems are mostly focus-based and not because of technique or anything else.

That said, the new iPad's display won't really blow your mind. Even here, with the new iPad and an iPad 2 in side-by-side easels 18 inches in front of me, I can't instinctively spot the difference between the two without looking for "tells." On the new iPad's screen, for example, a metallic button in the toolbar of my word processor has a bit of engraving on its background.

But no drug — brand or generic — works exactly the same way for everyone. That's why we want you to be actively engaged in your own health care. If you are taking a drug that requires very precise control of the dose, a generic's "equivalent" status may not do the trick for you. This problem is common with thyroid medications, so you're not alone in your difficulties using the generic version. Even for less-demanding medical regimens, a generic might not work the same way as a brand. Generics can use a slightly different "release" technology (altering how it gets into your system) and can change inactive ingredients like binders, fillers, preservatives, coloring and flavoring.

Hungry for the beard: Wes Bentley might have the Beard of the Year playing Seneca Crane in "Games." The lavish beard twists and turns in complicated directions -- and it's all his own hair. While sporting some stubble on Monday night, he didn't think about rocking the look again. "That beard needs a special designer, I can't do it myself," he said.
