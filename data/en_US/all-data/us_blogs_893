This was an important Apollo, as Balanchine’s work has not been seen in Cali since the 1940’s. The crowd cheered generously, and one group clapped especially for Jekyns, who was born and raised locally before departing to dance in the United States. Stretching backstage before the show, Jekyns whispered, “I’m excited! My family is here!” He added, “I’m already warm enough to perform!” No kidding – the humid climate is great for keeping muscles loose and ready to move.

Brewers & Chewers is a marvellous concept and one of which any self respecting beer nerd would be proud. A removal truck will pull up outside and clear the decks completely (leaving the bar and its twenty taps, of course) leaving behind a cosy nest of long tables and comfy chairs. Upon these tables will be placed a sumptuous three course feast and some special beers along with some very special guests.

I've tried not to let work intrude while I've been away but I haven't been 100% successful. I have to hire a new parish administrator and my attempt to post an ad on craigslist failed not once but twice. I'm wondering if the second failure had something to do with me trying to od fit from my iPad--it shouldn't but I just discovered the other day that email isn't sending correctly. Eh. And I have a whole slew of meetings to deal with, to say nothing of sermons etc.
Description: The male, peacock, is predominantly blue with a fan-like crest of spatula-tipped wire-like feathers and is best known for the long train made up of elongated upper-tail covert feathers which bear colourful eyespots. These stiff and elongated feathers are raised into a fan and quivered in a display during courtship. In Buddhist philosophy, the peacock represents wisdom. An interesting tip bit: In the 1890s, the term "peacocking" in Australia referred to the practice of buying up the best pieces of land ("picking the eyes") so as to render the surrounding lands valueless.
Not only that, but the husband of the ‘mutual friend’ helped the husband of the friend in his capacity as a builder/renovator (yes, another Brit in France doing properties up etc…) and took advantage of the husbands good nature and borrowed equipment and promptly broke/ruined/stole the aforesaid equipment. The husband of the ‘mutual friend’ is the sort of person who argues with his fists not his tongue so is best avoided!

But Speed’s mystery story was going nowhere until one editor wrote back, explaining the importance of pacing and suggesting a cut of 15,000 to 20,000 words—and, best yet, the editor had shown her how, by editing the first 70 pages. But, at first, this only annoyed Speed.

See, here I go and I totally apologize for this rant. I am really sorry about this. I get annoyed with this topic because it just seems like the next thing. Oh, what, world hunger is no longer important? Poverty isn’t a big deal? They’re all connected, but human trafficking is the big thing going around right now. It’s like, don’t you realize that there are other people struggling in this world? I just said that all those things are connected, yes, but there’s a disconnect in there somewhere too.
Michelle Yeoh is no stranger to many Ipohans. Since young, I have considered her as my role model because she is from Ballet background. From a small-town girl who aspired to be a Ballerina, then turned beauty queen and mega-super star on the screen. She is somebody I look up to and hope to be like her in future. It was from her, my idol, I started to dream to be a beauty queen one day.
Where where those people when I needed them? Right where they needed to be, and right where they are now.
But I will handle it. What I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is that there will come a time where we can look at each other and say: “Remember 2012? Yeah, that happened. I’m glad it’s over.”

So with that said, I'm grabbing my book. I'm currently reading 11/22/63 on a group read from our Book Lover's Hideaway Goodreads message boards. We have so much fun reading and commenting. It really brings us together. I love it and I love the girls on our boards. We have the best time. If you aren't over there joining in with us, you are sincerely missing out. ANYWAY, So that's what I'm reading. Since I'm reading it on my Nook, it's sort of hard to just randomly pick a page, but, I did pick a comment that made me smile and I'll share the sentences surrounding that comment for my Teaser. HERE we go!
Now I've thought a lot about The Game and I'd like to write a bit about it. The Game suggests, like much else in PKD's irv, that he thought of language as living, dynamic, and capable of changing the world outside itself. Think of the T.E.N.C.H. in Maze of Death. But The Game is slightly different. It exploits an aspect of language (the fact that we have more than one word to denote something) to create recreation, a way to pass the time. Insofar as the The Game is unproductive, it is actually counterproductive, as it distracts citizens from the degraded state of the society around them; it's an opiate of the masses. I was especially struck by the example 'water sheep,' which, it turns out, is a transliteration of 'hydraulic ram.' By translating the individual words in the sentence, players of the game are able to eliminate the meaning of the sentence, thereby destroying the phrase's cohesiveness. The object of the game is then to translate the words back by apprehending the original meaning of the sentence. In other words, you begin by imagining cohesiveness and then trying to attain it in the sentence. Do we play a game like this in our society? Yep. When you talk to Conservative Uncle and he says something about 'Global Climate Change' and you think to yourself 'oh, Global Warming!' When you go to buy a used car and they insist on calling it 'Pre-Owned.' This use of language is as mundane, circular, and unsatisfying as the rest of the society. I need some more time to suss out exactly what it is I'm trying to get at here - maybe in the comments section.
He is a Brisbane based Artist and was one of the youngest in his time to be accepted into a Fine Arts Course. His history is a long and colourful journey taking him from Stage Design for the La Boite Theatre, running a Gallery here in Brisbane, to Sydney again working in Theatre creating varied works from Poster Design for productions, to stage and costume design. While in Sydney he was commissioned by corporate clients such as Telstra to complete major works. His style and use of medium evolved which led him into water colour and the world of cartooning with a very successful series of sellout exhibitions.

But I can get the points for anything. Anything. Twinkies! Three points. If your goal is simply to see a smaller number on the scale and the tag of your pants then by all means just add up points, no matter what the food. But are you really getting healthy? You can calculate the points in diet coke (0), McDonald’s fries (5 in a small), and a Quaker Chewy Dips Granola Bar (3 for the Chocolate chip). But are you looking at what is IN these foods? Do you actually know what the ingredients are? What they do to your body?

If the new Democratic Congress is to be any different than the old Republicans, this is the sort of scraping and grinding from the public coffers that has to stop. To hell with bridges to nowhere, and other piddling earmarks, we need to shut off the conduit of the nation’s wealth set up from our pockets into the corporate world’s “venture capital.” In fact this is the sort of bold entrepreneurial spirit that only Karl Marx could possibly support.
Frustrated to have a Canon EOS 5D Mark II ever since, I just thought that a person should master NOT only the art of composition, but also to manipulate the settings IN-camera. Wait… including the megapixels… why 22, NOT 24? I think it is better NOT to expect more than the usual. Why are articulated LCD’s only reserved for the APS-C cameras? Why not the full-frame ones?

This episode was no "Mystery Spot," but I liked the way all the threads drew together. HATED Sam falling asleep at the wheel (inevitable) and almost doing a head-on with an eighteen wheeler. (Deliberate connection to the end of season 1, or laziness? Given the song they play at the end of the episode, I'm going with deliberate connection. What it means, if anything, I don't know.)

S.w.F.- The simple red coat you wore is an excellent choice for this portrait. It is so pure and rigorous that it defies obvious associations. It does not speak of status, era, function, or current fashion, and therefore does not distract the viewer from the image of the subject. The rich red attracts, but it is muted, almost antique, so that it doesn't overwhelm. It is a monastically simple coat, like many of the severe and simple garments of Balenciaga, Givenchy, Hardie Amies, or Oleg Cassini. It is perfect as it is so appropriate and compatible with the style of portrait, yet is a pure, architectural garment such as was fashionable in the early 1960s and is just as elegant today. I’m wondering if you can tell us anything about it or the designer.
Detailed discussions of the logistics of conducting diplomacy, doing business, or traveling abroad in the era give readers a vivid picture of how Americans experienced this age of international expansion, while contrasting Mexican and American visions of the changing relationship.
These were more delicious than the lemon lime sugar cookie truffles, but there is an extra step to this with the 2 layers of dipping. These were not worth the effort either. I would absolutely rather just eat the cookies plain. I doubled the recipe because 24 pieces is a waste of time to get all this junk out. And I am lazy and didn't want to dirty my food processor so I put the cookies in a large ziploc bag and beat the crap out of them with a meat mallet =)

The Italian For Italians sketch is...okay. The audience laughter at Terry Jones' instructor saying he is from Gerard's Cross is something lost on me. As for the Italians taking the lesson, they're played a little broadly, pinstripe suit-wearing spivs divided by regionalist pride. Political correctness makes sketches like these age poorly, but at the time other sketch programs would often display national stereotypes and call it humor. The Pythons are in fact offering their own twist on this trope. They would do it again throughout the series, and frankly, the underlying point is much more obvious. It's amusing enough, but not a strong sketch. Thankfully, Terry Jones sits on a pig (porcine casualty number three in this episode - PETA would be pissed!), leading to the first cartoon.

There’s nothing pretty about the Mercy Arms’ electric, self-titled offering. From Kirin J. Callinan’s trilled leads that slice like a rusty shiv through the reverb-drenched opener ‘Down Here, Too Long’ to Julian Sudek’s thunderous drums on ‘Speed’, nothing is overly polished in a mix that defies modern conventions. But that’s not to say that Mercy Arms isn’t a beautiful album. The songwriting skill evident on ‘Half Right’ and ‘Kilby’, a subtle ode to The Church, is evidence of the foundations that the Mercy Arms’ reputation has been built on.

I was so completely appalled by the system's inability to correctly identify a child's level of ability that I no longer wanted any part of it for me or my children...EVER. So, my decision was made then and there. They had already made a box for my child. And I knew that if I ever put her in public school, she would be labelled and crammed into that box for good. There would be no hope of breaking the cycle if I ever allowed it to begin.
Like many of you for some time I have been concerned about the poor pronunciation of people appearing on cookery programmes. Last year, for example, in the Great British Bake Off – a competition to find Britain’s best amateur baker – during the episode where they made scones, one contestant insisted, throughout, on pronouncing it “scone”. Now I tolerate individualism as much as the next person, but this casual disregard for proper pronunciation infuriated me. I wrote to the BBC – complaining that the word “scone” had been pronounced “scone” during the show (not by the presenter, I noted, but only by the contestant) and this showed declining standards at the BBC. When my e-mail complaining about this was read out on the radio I was shocked to hear the presenter pronounce “scone” as “scone” and “scone” as “scone”! This completely reversed the point I was trying to make. And despite numerous e-mails and phone calls the BBC refused to deal with my complaint and contrary to my strongly worded e-mail the presenter remains in work continuing to utter the word “scone” to listeners on a regular basis. It’s a scandal.

Whether or not you believe in the healing methods that homeothapy has that is one thing but a university professor has completely dismissed the healing methods that the treatment has.

She started an email list of news items dealing with trans "stuff", and sent it regularly. At first it was a fairly sort list, sent every few weeks. But the list got longer, and came more frequently. Eventually she had to break it into multiple emails. And not long after that, she had to stop altogether because she just couldn't keep up with it all.
Behind the principle of the analogy of faith is the prior confidence that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. If it is the Word of God, it must therefore be consistent and coherent. Cynics, however, say that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. If that were true, then we would have to say that the smallest mind of all is the mind of God.

I enjoyed the day, enjoyed the beautiful weather, enjoyed seeing great friends on the looped course. I spent the first 8 or 9 miles with Emily feeling good and telling stories... but I knew her hamstring was really bothering her. She made the wise decision to preserve her body and take it easy the rest of the way in, so as another Racing It Off runner, Monica, caught up to us, I headed out with Monica to run with her for the rest of her half. Monica was having tummy troubles, so I'm glad I got to distract her a little for the remainder of the miles. And she finished strong! We all knew we had another day of running ahead, so we all tried to be pretty conservative on the pacing.

This is the kind of job to have. Be elected to maintain and improve our Nation, get swamped by letters and blogs and broadcasters from the great majority of Americans pleading with you to attend to the problems, blame each other for doing nothing, and go home to campaign for office again. On top of that, you get paid pretty well to do all of this.
I've learned a lot the last 5 months and 7 days. Much more than I can write about here. Like I said, grief and mourning is a personal journey. It takes you places you never dreamed. Or want to dream about.
To read Scripture as a church is to remember the unfolding history of God’s saving work in the world. When we as a church take time to remember the things that God has done through God’s people, we are reminded of our place as a community – as God’s community of blessing to the world. Reading the Psalms through the lens of Auburn football is certainly not a way to reflect on Christian salvation or some crude way to pronounce God’s blessing solely on my Tigers. With that in mind, though, to read the Psalms in light of one’s participation in a community like the Auburn family is to be able to identify with so many emotions exhibited by the Psalmist in our Scriptures. The seasons of 2008, 2009 and 2010, with the wins, losses, interaction with rivals, faux-scandals and attack from outside sources, gives those of us with orange-and-blue blood a real point of identification when we revisit the Psalms as a people of God. Having experienced many of these ebbs and flows that Nomel has identified teaches us a way of reading Scripture that we might not have thought of before. While we do not read the Psalms and identify Auburn when the Psalmist speaks and Alabama when the “wicked” or “enemy” is identified, this book shows us that we can certainly can identify what many of these Psalms actually feel like.
People have continued to pack up and move to greener job prospects -- the population has been on the decline for over a decade.

Fifthly, it was surprising that the CBI has so assiduously stuck with last November 2010’s EU Autumn economic forecast for Ireland given the events of the past four months. It wasn’t just the CSO’s bombshell on Wednesday morning – that it was revising up the February 2011 unemployment rate from 13.5% to 14.6%.- which made the CBI’s baseline unemployment rate of 13.4% for 2011 look low, it was keeping the 0.9% GDP projection for 2011 against the background of continuing deposit flight in the banks and the emerging evidence of the effect of deleveraging on the economy. The CBI might say in its defence that the stress testing parameters were signed off in January 2011.

Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved a television show called Doctor Who. A man named David Tennant played the role of the Doctor, and a man named Russell T. Davies wrote a lot of the episodes of the television show. The television show was wonderful and marvelous and magical and the girl was happy. Once day, the man who played the Doctor and the man who wrote for the Doctor decided to leave and never return, and the girl was sad, for no one could ever be as good as her Doctor was, especially not that Matt Smith fellow. He looked like someone stretched silly putty over a deflated basketball. But she watched the new Doctor just the same.

Font jewellery is simplified to bust and can be utilised to tog up or coiffure down. They are easily purchasable and the tracheophyte offered is long.

5. We had the stomach virus! There is almost nothing I hate more! It was the night of the Almost Slumber Party, after we'd gone to bed. I was awakened by Lia, who had come to let me know that Kate was throwing up. I had been having trouble sleeping, so I'd gotten a set of ear plugs and taken a melatonin, which knocks me out. I was so out of it! I managed to get up and walk to their room to find that Kate had indeed thrown up... from off the top bunk! You just can not imagine the mess, the splatter pattern, and I'll spare you the details. All I know is I just stood there not knowing what to do in my half-sleep state. And I may or may not have ruined our vacuum by suggesting Mark vacuum up the solids... Anyway, that was at 12:30 a.m. By 3:30 a.m., I had joined her. Thankfully, Michelle came to the rescue by coming and picking up the other three children that morning, since she'd been thoroughly exposed the night before anyway.

For me, one of the greatest pleasures of my life is knowing other writers, who carry their notebooks like security blankets, and talk about our favorite authors like they're friends we saw on the street earlier, and have portmanteau-making contests over French fries (and are nerdy enough to know what portmanteau means), and who constantly send me emails with subject lines like "i am obsessed with this poem."

Known to his friends as ‘Master’, Christ burst onto the local Messiah scene three years ago with a series of sermons and alleged miracles. Born under mysterious circumstances in Bethlehem in the year 0, Christ first aroused attention during King Herod’s infamous Christmas Baby Massacre, narrowly escaping with his parents to Egypt. He later came to prominence as a child preacher in the Temple of Jerusalem, before disappearing from the radar during puberty and only returning some eighteen years later.

I have not yet get myself listened to their music before, so I did not really know any of their songs they played that night. They play quite nice with their tune and funny gags from the members, but I did not really enjoy the songs that much. Yet, you may enjoy their tune here.
I said it a few posts back…once I move home my workout habits are going to slowly die. Well, it’s happening. I haven’t gone for a run since my 5K on Saturday. Sunday was graduation, so I didn’t plan on running anyways. Monday it was rainy and gross out, so I skipped the run. Tuesday was also gloomy, so again, I skipped the run.

The 41 Golf GTIs were rented from the government's G-Fleet for R19 207 a month each, while 14 BMWs were rented for R18 916 each a month. Official documents indicate the agreement between the department and G-fleet appears to be a flat-rate rental fee.
So I love to read. I mean I have a degree in English with a minor in history, so I would have to love to read. So, today I’m going to talk about the books I’ve read recently. I haven’t done this before but I’ll try to start doing it more often.
Surprisingly I wasn’t late to the flight. The flight was delayed. I’m not really sure how this all working out for the allegedly struggling airlines. They keep charging more and more for each little details (there are rumors that soon even the toilets will soon be not free), so people keep cramming more and more in carry-on. This causing more time to load and unload thus causing delays. How much those delays really cost them? Well, they who make decisions don’t fly coach. Who are paying are the passengers.
I’m enjoying reading your blog but today’s story is making me think that you are more sensationalist then an objective observer. The story clearly said that it was an misunderstanding. Yes, family living outside the area where the school bus is operating is a problem that should be dealt with but it’s not related in any way to what you are trying to make it into. The biggest mistake you can make in this “new phase of a very old war” is to lose credibility.
So why are General Strikes less common in the U.S., with none having taken place since 1946? A big reason is that the notorious anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 1947 prohibits political and solidarity strikes (along with sit-down and wildcat strikes). It also led to the purge of a great many radicals from the AFL-CIO unions. Ever since then, these mainstream unions and their leaders have largely become loyal partners of the capitalist system willing only to bargain collectively and occasionally, if at all, to risk a strike for somewhat better wages and working conditions. Today, since the economic crisis has hit hard and taken its fearful toll, the number of strikes has fallen to a historically low level, with only five strikes involving more than 1,000 workers in 2009. Nevertheless, while unions may well face fines and jail time under Taft-Hartley, its strictures do not apply to Occupy or other groups that may try to call for a General Strike. Recently, some union leaders have realized they need Occupiers to do things on behalf of workers and the 99% that they feel they cannot openly, legally endorse. In some places as with West Coast dock workers and New York City subway workers, unions have given Occupy actions their sub rosa approval and support. And, as one of my comrades in Occupy Central Vermont has observed, hopefully this year’s May Day General Strike — with various actions to interrupt business-as-usual scheduled for 115 cities across the country — will put some sharper teeth back into the strike tactic in general. Even though a true (and unprecedented) nationwide General Strike against capitalism does not seem to be in the offing this year — it’s more a wishful dream (thank goodness for the dreamers in Occupy!) — with the crisis brought on by the 1% showing no end in sight and the populace angry as hell, May 1st 2012 promises to be a major and perhaps turning point occasion in the history of U.S. class struggle. Don’t miss it!

Crunch: 2 sets of 25
last week, i was taking chloe for a quick pee and i noticed a butterfly. oh great, i thought. the season is here. but then i saw another. and another. and they were literally everywhere; as common as the little brown bird. and they're all the black and red suckers. the next day, i took her on a walk and about 3 minutes in, i think i had seen more butterflies than i had in the previous 10 years. it was by far the worst walk of my life and i just wanted to get home. i couldn't even take breaths when i got in and then i vented my frustrations on twitter. i asked dylan, mr environmentalist, what is up with all these butterflies?! have you seen them?! there's got to be a reason! tell me! there's more than normal, i swear i'm not crazy! he said it probably had something to do with the climate, and to that i said, duh. but really, he didn't know. the next day, he posted this article on my facebook wall. basically, this is the gist of the article...

Her credentials as a guerilla filmmaker were established through her participation as an uncredited co-director in the collective that made Winter Soldier, about the Vietnam War veterans who returned to the United States to testify about the war crimes that they witnessed and participated in. Virtually every aspect of this film was conceived and executed in opposition to the prevailing orthodoxies of documentary filmmaking and distribution, from its subject matter and unapologetically anti-war stance, to its collaborative and anonymous authorship.

I spent all of last night making pasta and so far all the effort seems worth it. I made two types, one herb pasta and one chili pepper pasta. I used chili pepper pasta for today's lunch. It was SO good! It wasn't necessarily hot but it definitely added to the flavor and I could feel a bit of spice in the back of my throat. It was delicious. I am a bit hesitant about posting the recipe away because I'm currently pondering adding homemade pasta (dried) to my Etsy store and this will be one of them.

I admit it. I got up late and scoured my house for pictures for this blogest, and I haven't done any revision today. Aaah! However, yesterday I had met my word count revision goal, and I know I can do the same today. It just might not be until tonight when my kids are in dance class. I did do something I hadn't planned though - I changed the first three chapters (again). However, I managed to do it in a way that will coincide with chapter four pretty nicely. From here on out, it's just polish time.
I feel like I should mention that it started at ten. I suppose this is normal for most people, but I’m usually in pajamas, watching a movie with my best friends Ben and Jerry by that time.

Dreamy, gothic, chilling, macabre--these are all words which can be applied to Joanne Owen's first two novels, Puppet Master and The Alchemist and the Angel. They are a hauntingly original blend of the historical with a kind of Angela Carter-esque fantastical absurd. But I think what I like best about Joanne's books is that they are liberally dotted with golden nuggets of folkloric myth. The tales of Central and Eastern Europe are not my field of expertise--Baba Yaga is one of my favourite stories (as it is Joanne's), but that's about as far as it goes for me. So when I met Joanne for the first time this year (we shared a speaking platform at a recent Writeaway conference) my ears pricked up at once when she started talking about Cabinets of Curiosity and Chapels of Bones and, of course, all that Slavic and Czech folklore. It was immediately obvious to me that she would be the perfect person to do a Mythic Friday interview, and after reading her books I'm all fired up to go and find out more about golems and magic hazelnuts and enchanted tree stumps in deep dark forests. No doubt I shall have nightmares for weeks! Welcome to Scribble City Central, Joanne, thanks for visiting and over to you.

As far as I’m aware, no-one is suggesting that all hospitals in Wales should have a team of qualified brain surgeons on hand. The annual number of cases simply does not require that level of provision. Generalising from that, it is clear that there is, therefore, a willingness to accept that certain specialised types of care are best provided in a smaller number of hospitals which have the

I cried a few times while reading the trilogy..... which always makes for a good story.... to emotionally attach yourself to the story...... those are the best books.
I’ll never forget that day, and I’ll never forget going back into my journal and being amazed at what I found. Exercise was REALLY making a difference!! My moods had steadily improved since I started working out and I was less all over the place. I’m on what my Dr.’s call a “sub-therapeutic” dose for my medications for my Bipolar and anxiety, which basically means what I’m on shouldn’t work in the first place. I have several theories for this:
One of my pet peeves is names copied from Tolkien. Lorien, for those who don’t know, is a land in Middle Earth. The forest of Lothlorien lies close by. Thus, when I saw the name Lorien, I did a facepalm. This was one reason I thought this was written by a kid. Another reason was the large letters on the outsides of the pages. That kind of thing would only be thought up by a new author, and probably by a kid.

Living without my mom breathing down my neck will probably be fun, even though I barely know how to cook, do laundry, wash dishes, and probably breath for myself.

I don't know about you but when it comes time to help my kids with homework, I would rather go to the dentist. I hate all the whining and crying and everything else that goes with homework (and the kids whine a lot too!). But we have to help our kids - that is part of parenting, or so I'm told. But what happens when you don't know what you are doing and can't help them with their homework? Well, back when we were in school the answer was easy, but not that fun - tutoring. You either had to stay late after school to let your teacher help you or our parents had to pay someone to tutor us, and that doesn't sound cheap to me.
Speaking of Dexter-level wordsmiths, I had to include Rick DeMarinis's Mama's Boy on my 2011 favorite novels list at Ransom Notes even though it weren't technically no mystery book. DeMarinis does write crime, but yeah, it was a stretch to put that particular book on a mystery blog. Please avail yerself of DeMarinis through his novels or short stories (he's got like three collections of shorts - fantastic) and tell your friends and neighbors to as well. He deserves a much more prominent place in the reading public's consciousness. That particular list is, I think, a helluva good showing for the last year. Even with penalizing some of my favorite books like Craig McDonald's El Gavilan, John Rector's Already Gone and Scott Phillips' The Adjustment for their authors having appeared on my 2010 list, it's some strong ass shit. Check it out and tell me what you think.

I loved debate so much that I continued until college. I entered the Ateneo Debate Society (ADS), the most awarded debate institution in Asia, consistently ranked as part of the top ten best debate institutions in the world. I competed in several national and international debate tournaments. I was champion of the College of Saint Benilde Intervarsity. I got to the semifinals of the National Debate Championships twice, and I also reached the finals. I ended my career going up the stage to receive the United Asia Debating Championship award for fourth best speaker in Asia. As I got up on that stage, Steph said that I looked like I won the Oscars, but on that night, I won something more. I won my battle against my shyness. I won the battle against myself.

This sura begins rather innocuously with the Jewish Problem, but the words against the Jews soon begin to heat up. For example, the Jews are ‘iniquitous’. That is, they are bad, wicked and sinful. Not only that, but the Koran, or Mohamed, soon stops talking about ‘some Jews’ and starts talking about ‘Jews’ and ‘them’ or ‘their’.

For two people who never get sick to both catch something on the trip is annoying. Saturday evening we skipped the entertainment at the rally because I just did not feel like trekking back and forth in the dark. The neighbors here who also were at the rally said they did the same thing. In my case I had not been sleeping well for a couple nights and decided it was just too much stimulation in the evenings and then the cold walk back to the coach awakened me. I am so accustomed to my quiet reading time an hour or so before bedtime that my mind and or body were rebelling at the absence of quiet.

Johannson adds that Obama is making the same argument on behalf of Obamacare. “If he had the gall to actually tell the Supreme Court that they have no authority to determine the unconstitutionality of his illegitimate policies, what makes anyone think he believes they have the authority to disqualify him due to his lack of constitutional eligibility? Obama believes he holds preeminent power over all branches of government because of his delusions of political grandeur.”
Auster has written some more. No answer to my points. He is more interested in speculating about my pseudonym. Really. He says my thinking works like an anti-semitic computer program.At the core of the program is the false epiphany: “Now I see it! The Jews are responsible for everything that has gone wrong with the West, the Jews are the enemy, and everyone is covering this up, and I alone have the courage to reveal this truth and call the Jews to account.”So he thinks I’m an automaton. An inferior whose arguments he must exaggerate in order to make them sound unserious. I think this means I will not be getting any substantive answer.
My skin appeared dry today and I was tired, so I decided to pamper myself. With a cucumber and limes in the refrigerator, plus a full jar of honey in the cabinet, I decided to whip up a nice soothing facial for myself. One that heals, softens and moistures my skin, while promoting new cell growth. Just in time for the spring sunshine.
And I began collecting and amassing toys that were still in their packaging. I proudly displayed them on my wall. I would routinely make sure they were dusted and unaffected by anything that would potentially affect their value. I used thumb tacks and pin them to my wall. The tack would then but used as a hanger to slip the packaging onto. (I never punctured the packaging at all.)

On another note, while I was wearing this yesterday somebody told me, “I really like that thing.” while pointing to this vest. My response? “Really? I HATE it!” She looked at me, obviously confused, and I had to explain how I am trying to wear clothes that I don’t really like… At this point I think she was even more confused… Next time, I think a simple, “thank you” will suffice.
Reflecting upon that kind of scenario does make one wonder about the kind of parents that would do such a thing to their young, innocent and impressionable child. But the answer to that particular question became readily apparent a few moments later when the kid’s father came strolling up the hiking path dressed in virtually the same idiotic nerdy outfit as his son.

I told of my pregnancy with her. I teared up when I recounted the diagnosis of death we were given for her. I told the full story of my last weeks of pregnancy, of the days of laboring to birth her, in peace, at home. Of her flight to heaven on the wings of angels. Of cleaning her still body. Of dressing her. The pain of taking her to the hospital, to the officials.

As the hour wore on, I was surprised at both my ability to keep the conversation going and in my personal openness. Jack was sweet, kind, and polite. He had this charming way of being both boyish and gentlemanly. At the end of the night, I walked Jack to my building’s front door. “What are you up to this week?” he inquired. “Working, volunteering, and I’m going to a bunch of concerts. Radiohead and Andrew Bird.” His eyes lit up with excitement. “I’ve been trying to see Radiohead for years! I’m so jealous!” I laughed and told him I would let him know how it was. I hugged him goodnight, unsure if he, or I, was interested in more than just that.
That command to go to the Gentiles could not be found anywhere in the, then, revealed Scripture. God had to communicate something new. But now, all the revelation of the Bible is complete and we are expressly warned not to add to it.

Why I did not write this book in 1992? Now I understand the secrets of Allah. I started writing it 20 years ago but why did it take so long to finish it? Because there is a time for everything. If I had written it 20 years ago, then America would not have been in Afghanistan at that time. That lesson and advices would have been lost which we desperately need today. At that time it would have been just another tale and not a counsel. Allah had ordained this time. For 20 years, I was prepared through experiences that have now become the part of this book. In the Muslim Ummah, in fact, in the whole world, there is not a single book on Afghan jihad like this one. Thousands of pictures captured in the Afghan jihad had been with us for the last 25 years. During this time, we also shifted a lot, so only Allah knows how they survived up till now. These are rare pictures and have never been published before anywhere in the world. Then, some pages from our diaries and all related records were retrieved in the last couple of months miraculously. It was obvious that we had extra-ordinary Divine help at hand. Alhamdolillah, Allah has given a loyal and loving team to us who worked for the sake of Allah and only He can repay their efforts. Their contribution for the Ummah is great indeed. Men depart but this Sadqa jariya will remain.

Last week we had Karl Singporewala in AUCB to speak to the students of Interior Architecture & Design, along with Architecture, about his work both in the office and out. Karl spoke about his work on the design team for a new research centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour at the University College London (large scale project) and then spoke of a (small scale project) sculptural project for a client’s private garden where he designed and built a modern sundial. Karl also shared his personal work with us, speaking of his entries to the Royal Academy of Arts Summer Exhibition, and gave the students a first look at this year’s entry. After the talk, Karl joined us back in the studio to assist on the crit panel for the first year’s final presentation.

Speaking of not being bothered so much, my state of mind has improved greatly since the last posting. Partly, I think, this is because we have a plausible plan that avoids the death of a thousand cuts on my leg. The fact that spring is busting out all over is also very helpful. However, I also think that Dr. C‘s notice positive things regime is helping a lot. I have been recording good stuff faithfully on a daily basis for about a month now and life does seem pretty good.

As we all know, Albert Pujols is in a major slump. He hasn’t hit a home run, and is hitting sub-.250. He’s got 4 RBI’s…Nobody knows what’s wrong with him so far this season. To be honest, I’m glad he’s in this slump. I’m happy because he left, no, abandoned the Cardinals with such a money-first attitude. He wasn’t concerned with winning more rings and staying loyal to his team. Nope, everyone says it’s a business. Follow the money…

We went last night. Thursdays are great -- small lines, all beers are still flowing, port-o-potties still clean. I know they always run out of some, but I was suprised that at 5:30 on Thursday they were on their last keg of the collaborator (don't know if it was for the night or the weekend).

I got into Louisville about 8:20, and holed up in my hotel room till about half an hour after the UK/UofL game was over...and then went out to get a beer. I walked down to the Bluegrass Brewing Company taproom on 4th Street, dropped at the bar, and after considering the sessiony Altbier...went for the Duppy Conqueror, which they described as a "Belgian porter." Tasted more like a roasty dubbel, but hey, there's crossover territory there. Had one more -- a 7.5% Rye IPA that was spicy/hoppy, but maybe a bit heavy for my tastes; I like rye IPAs a bit crisper -- and then called it a night; it was a long day of driving.

There are a few people I know what they like. My stepdad and dad have a few authors in common, and my stepdad also likes books like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and even found the Hunger Games interesting. My sister reads the most and loves YA. One of her favorite authors is Tamora Pierce and she loves reading both fantasy and realistic fiction. She has a Nook now and adores it. However, my two stepsisters... I had no idea what they read or if they read. I know one may not have time right now with her new career as a nurse and the other, well I texted her because I was curious.

I loved The Midwife, which is the memoir of a young nurse that trains and practices as a midwife in 1950′s in London’s East End. Jenny Lee works out of a convent that provides nursing/OB/GYN services to the poverty-stricken neighborhood. Through reading this book, I met the naughty (or senile?) nun that eats at least half of a cake intended for the entire convent. I also met the pig-enthusiast nun who assures the janitor that rough pig intercourse is normal, as they observe it. I also learned the secret to a happy marriage, even after 24 children!

Today's card base is Cranberry Crisp layered with White Cardstock then Mantle Patterned Paper stitched around the edge. The shadow layer is Mellow Moss. The image was printed on White Cardstock and colored in using copic markers. I stitched around the edges then wrapped white lace around the card base. To embellish the card I added two paper flowers arranged with an oak leaf and pine branches punched from Mellow Moss cardstock and finished off with a large clear jem. I also added a small clear jem in the corners of the image.

That one guy and I were starting, I thought, to get serious. It was must have been NYE ’07, and I had never cared for New Years, but was excited to ring this one in with this wonderful new man in my life. I’d also never purchased lingere before, like, pretty, sexy lingere. SO I went to Victoria’s Secret, picked up a sexy little thing, and then went and got 3 bottles of champagne, because I figured that was about how much I would need to get the courage to wear the lingere. I had plans to go to a party with friends from high school, but was going to meet up with my man before the stroke of midnight. Because I’m not completely stupid I remained sober while at that party, because I knew I would have to drive to his house later on in the evening and I had no intention of letting a DUI spoil my evening. But, midnight came and went, and I was still at my party. Calls and texts went unanswered. I ended up driving home around 1:30 in the morning and sleeping solo. Happy Fucking New Year. The next morning, on my way to open the shop I picked up orange juice to go with the 3 bottles of champagne I had in my trunk. I also tossed the little pink bag carrying the unworn lingere. Burning it would have been more satisfying, but explaining the flaming heap of black lace would have been difficult. I still had no new messages, missed calls, and I stopped checking. I put my phone in my purse, rather than it’s usual spot in my pocket. I was beyond caring at this point. I popped the first bottle of champagne. I would end up drinking two of the 3 bottles that day. I wound up on the hood of my car for a while. Just laying there in the nice January sunshine, feeling sorry for myself. He showed up later that afternoon. I had become comfortably numb. He approached me outside, and I just turned around and walked back in. He came to the counter, I answered the phone. We did this little dance for a few minutes and he finally gave up and left. Anyone in their right mind would have stuck with the silent treatment I already had going. I however, was not in my right mind. I was in love.

Meeting with God in His presence will change your life. Jacob, as we will see next week, limped away after his encounter with God which was an outward reminder of his meeting with God and inwardly the limp was a reminder to walk humbly before God. Moses had a face that shone after his encounter with God which was a reminder to him and to everyone else of the ways God worked in Moses life. Saul became Paul and was called to ministry and Peter was given a new commission as we will see later. You will be changed – that is something that all of us need – we need to be changed by God! God wants to change each of us – will you allow him to do it?

Against the scientific prejudice.--The biggest fable of all is the fable of knowledge. One would like to know what things-in-themselves are; but behold, there are no things-in-themselves! But even supposing there were an in-itself, an unconditioned thing, it would for that very reason be unknowable! Something unconditioned cannot be known; otherwise it would not be unconditioned! Coming to know, however, is always "placing oneself in a conditional relation to something" one who seeks to know the unconditioned desires that it should not concern him, and that this same something should be of no concern to anyone. This involves a contradiction, first, between wanting to know and the desire that it not concern us (but why know at all, then?) and, secondly, because something that is of no concern to anyone IS not at all, and thus cannot be known at all.--
“Games are won and lost in the midfield,” he said. “Most of the game is fought and played in the midfield and that’s where you keep possession of the ball. Having such a strong midfield helps us keep possession and that’s key to our philosophy — not taking risks, just keeping the ball and waiting for opportunities to happen.”

When I bought my entertainment center equipment, I did open up a Best Buy credit card. It wasn’t that I didn’t have the money, but I didn’t want to spend all that money at one time. The card offered me one to three years of no interest (dependant on the total cost), as long as I continued to make payments. With everything I bought, I ended up with three years of no interest. What I ended up doing was calculating my payments so that I could pay it off in half the time (1.5 years). This gave me enough time to pay it without having to worry about hitting the three years. If I had an emergency during one month, I could pay less and continue my payments the following month. During tax return seasons, I usually paid a bit more to get it paid off even sooner.

Centuries ago, hazy was hawsey. A nautical term, it somehow got connected to the German word hase, or hare. Superstitious folk refused to let a dead hare aboard a fishing boat. And curses on the sailor that even mouthed the word while at sea. But in Old English, hazy’s origin was the word hasu, meaning gray or dusky.

We’re certainly going to see more studies like this one, either from Île aux Coudres or from other regions of French Canada. In general, French Canadian communities are ideal for the study of human microevolution. Records of births, marriages, and deaths are remarkably complete over a span of three centuries, and the inhabitants tended to stay put in the same locality generation after generation. For several regions of Quebec, we already have complete genealogical databases that could be enriched with genetic data for the most recent generations.

The BJCP style guidelines describe American IPA as “a decidedly hoppy and bitter, moderately strong American pale ale.” We chose the style because, though it originated in England, it’s become ubiquitous here. Employing lively American hops that give the beer its distinctive character, ranging from citrusy, floral and fruity to resinous, piney and even a note some tasters are prone to call “cat box,” American craft brewers have made IPA their own.

He also definitely knew how to cast — one of the lingering joys of Dark Shadows is its cast, who continue to appear at the conventions that honor the show, and who have aged incredibly well (most of the cast members look as if maybe two decades or so have passed since the series bit the dust; instead it’s been exactly 40 years).

In the meanwhile, he was elected as mayor of Alexandra, in the mid 80s. This however did not sit well with a substantive percentage of the people of Alexandra and in 1985, his house was bombed and the pressure was taking a toll on his family.

In time I understood why she was so.

It is believed that the grassed area around the Chapel was used as a burial ground. Several memorial slabs and coffin lids are located on this site, the memorial slabs dating from the seventeenth century. The chapel is believed to have been destroyed by fire in 1690 and never rebuilt. However, the coffin lids are substantially older than this, i.e. possibly thirteenth century. Other evidence suggests that the site is much older with Roman influence including an altar. This altar is now in the Newcastle University Museum of Antiques.

Hobsbawm’s main argument is that this period witnessed a massive advance in the world economy, in industrial capitalism, in the social order it represented, and in the ideas and beliefs which seemed to legitimize it – science, progress and liberalism. The study is divided thematically with a prelude focusing on the Revolutions of 1848, part one examining the social, economic, and political developments of the time, and part two exploring the results of these developments. According to Hobsbawm, who is an affirmed Marxist, 1848 sets the tone for this period and it is primarily the failure of the revolutions that enable capitalism’s advancement. Hobsbawm understands the revolutions as heterogeneous with each nation desiring a different political outcome; however, he also suggests that the revolutionaries throughout Europe consisted of the laboring poor whose demands frightened the liberals and the moderates into negotiations and agreements with the old regimes. Thus, for the author, 1848 failed because the confrontation was not between old regimes and progress but between order and social revolution and the liberal moderates preferred order.

Non-exclusive licensee should insist on this clause. It provides that should the licensor grant another licence to a third party on more favourable terms, the more favourable terms will then apply to the first licensee. Normally, the licensor is reluctant to incorporate such a clause, especially if the technology is likely to be licensed to several parties, but the licensee should insist on it. In granting such a provision, the licensor will probably want a definition of “more favourable terms”.

There are two large “coffee table” books that will make super gifts come December. This first is Sinatra: Hollywood His Way by Timothy Knight ($35.00, Running Press) that pays tribute to the fifty-nine films in which he appeared from the 1940s to the 80s. Best known as a singer, Sinatra was also a very good actor as his performance in “From Here to Eternity” demonstrated, as well as others such as “The Manchurian Candidate.” Musically, he co-starred in the classic “Anchors Aweigh” with Gene Kelly, appearing as well with Hollywood greats that included Rita Hayworth, Dean Martin, and Sophia Loren. For a certain generation, Sinata defined everything that was hip and cool. This book is filled with photos and for any fan of the man and that era of films, it will be a treasure. If you’re a fan of Mad magazine (and who isn’t?) then you will want to add Sergio Aragones: Five Decades of his Finest Works to your list of books you must have ($29.95, Running Press). Aragones is more than a cartoonist. He is an illustrator who has earned a place for himself for his visual gags, some drawn quite simply while others are extraordinarily elaborate. More than 500 of his favorite “Marginals”, the popular tiny cartoons found in Mad magazine’s margins are included In black and white, and in color, this book provides laughter on every page. Aragones has won many prestigious awards over the years including the Comic Art Professional Society’s Sergio Award, named for him!

Rosa Mendes or shall I say RRRROSA (emphasis on the Rosa) looks undeniably sexy and stunning here! This hot latina may have had a stressful week with a tag team title change but her bad boys won’t get her leaving upset… my lovely Rosa simply looks FLAW-LESS!

The beautiful twins looks really gorgeous in their new Diva title shoot as Nikki hoists the butterfly high to show her love and passion for that title! It did take years of hard work to get that prestige and finally, she got it! The Bellas continue to make me feel happy with their win and their shoot! They look truly beautiful!

The worry is now of course the really rather dreadful behaviours of individuals who call themselves nationalists, individuals and factions that war with each other at nationalisms expense, it would seem that these are dark days for British nationalism, dark days indeed, but a new movement is forming steadily in the background, a movement based upon correct nationalist principle ,this movement threatens to break out some feel ,yet I have as yet to gauge both its number and its potency, certainly the time has come to return to tradition, to real nationalism and let the fools play and the egos squabble.

Teams have to find the most efficient way to vent hot air from within the sidepods. This air has to pass through the radiators and coolers, as it passes from the sidepod inlet to the tail of the coke-bottle shape. In order to keep the car as slim as possible for reduced and drag and better airflow to the diffuser and beam wing, teams adopt different cooling outlet solutions to work with the other aero flow structures around the car. In Renaults case the majority of the outlet area is in three places: a tall narrow outlet above the gearbox and two low and wide vents either side of the gearbox. We can see the gearbox oil cooler within the upper outlet, so some of its volume is used for venting this heat. Reducing its ability to vent air from the sidepods.

From moment one, I wanted a natural birth. No drugs, no interventions, no doctors and NO HOSPITAL. A full on tree hugging, green, fuzzy, give birth in the woods while unicorns unite in a birthing circle of wondrous rainbows gleaming from all the creatures of the earth culminating in a beam of light spiritual experience I could hold in my heart of hearts forever. Over the summer, I mentioned to FB a story I read where a woman leaned on a walking stick throughout her birth. It made me think of wizards and lasers. FB immediately went on a vision quest into the Burgundy woods, found a sapling tree, cut it down and hand carved me my very own 7 foot long birthing stick, varnished and everything. It was beautiful and I was Gandolf. I practiced spinning it on the lawn while chanting...."BRING FORTH THE SPAAAAAAAAAAWN!" (insert lightning bolts)
"If we are to continue as a civilization that successfully avoids natural catastrophes, we have to make our own constraints on growth and make them strong and make them now." As it is, we are unintentionally at war with Gaia and must agree to "wartime" rationing and temporary "loss of freedom." Strong constraints? Loss of freedom? What's the difference between this and ecofascism? And how far down will our population have to plummet to satisfy Gaia? Actually, Lovelock states that something like nine-tenths of our population must vanish: "Personally I think we would be wise to aim at a stabilized population of about half to one billion." To accomplish this goal, both the birth rate and death rate would have to be "regulated" as "part of population control."

I talked a lot about my pain in my last post. I must say that in the last couple of years, I don't feel it very often. Most of that is in the past. I endured it and have come out the other side. I've had enough days of being crumpled on the floor of my closet, eneveloped in tears, unable to function to last me a lifetime, and I do believe the worst is over. I deserve for the worst to be over.

Here are a couple of older editions of Carlsons book from my library. The 1939 edition on the left contains a fair amount of text that was edited out of later editions and is interesting for that reason. It is not a first edition, that would be from 1929, which I don't own. The later somewhat edited versions are renamed Carlsons guide to landscape painting instead of elementary principles of landscape painting.

15) You Know Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics
The Guardian flatteringly described the book as a ‘hilarious satire on modern Ireland‘? Did you set out with that intention? Was this a work principally of satire? I’m not really that comfortable with tags like comedy or satire or whatever, like your book can only be one thing. I wanted to tell the story of these characters as faithfully and honestly as I could. There’s a lot of humour, because most of the characters are teenagers and they act in quite an unguarded and extreme way, but it’s mostly realistic and I’m not setting them up to be laughed at. The word ‘satire’ to me conjures up images of the author mocking the foibles of humanity from some great height – everyone’s a grotesque, and their entire world is revealed to be fundamentally deluded and ridiculous. I didn’t have any interest in writing a book like that. That said, setting the book in this school was a useful way of looking at bigger changes that were happening in the country – because these were the most privileged children of the people who were reaping the benefits of the economic boom. They were handed this new world that generation had created, so they were at the coal-face of that new morality and that new attitude to money and materialism.

Needless to say he makes the wrong decision. And while his story remains frozen – the story of the pond, the old men and the couple who brought their whole living room in a truck to keep them company while they fished – he finally lets us know what happened in that orchard in 1948 before returning to 1979 where he has been sitting with his “ear pressed up against the past as if it was the wall of a house that no longer exists” and where he finally gets to finish reliving the previous memory and let it run on to its end. Is it the twelve-year-old boy that the couple find waiting for them or does he house the consciousness of the man full of regret and remorse that he will become? I couldn’t say. The couple set up their living room beside the lake, begin to cook their meal and the next thing they notice he’s vanished:

George Bailey has spent his entire life giving of himself to the people of Bedford Falls. He has always longed to travel but never had the opportunity in order to prevent rich skinflint Mr. Potter from taking over the entire town. All that prevents him from doing so is George’s modest building and loan company, which was founded by his generous father. But on Christmas Eve, George’s Uncle Billy loses the business’s $8,000 while intending to deposit it in the bank. Potter finds the misplaced money and hides it from Billy. When the bank examiner discovers the shortage later that night, George realizes that he will be held responsible and sent to jail and the company will collapse, finally allowing Potter to take over the town. Thinking of his wife, their young children, and others he loves will be better off with him dead, he contemplates suicide. But the prayers of his loved ones result in a gentle angel named Clarence coming to earth to help George, with the promise of earning his wings. He shows George what things would have been like if he had never been born. In a nightmarish vision in which the Potter-controlled town is sunk in sex and sin, those George loves are either dead, ruined, or miserable. He realizes that he has touched many people in a positive way and that his life has truly been a wonderful one.

There can be no genuine happiness separate and apart from the home, and every effort made to sanctify and preserve its influence is uplifting to those who toil and sacrifice for its establishment. Men and women often seek to substitute some other life for that of the home; they would make themselves believe that the home means restraint; that the highest liberty is the fullest opportunity to move about at will. There is no happiness without service, and there is no service greater than that which converts the home into a divine institution, and which promotes and preserves family life.
And of course actual English spoken by gai-jin or "foreigners" in anime sounds something like this:Pera pera pae, perpera pera pa.To be fair, "pera pera" means "to be fluent" in Japanese, and a lot of people in Japan are "Eigo pera pera" (Fluent in English), but don't expect every person you walk up to on the street to speak English. You simply need to learn to speak Japanese the right way. Of course, then you would be be committing Japongo. Which is a word I just made up, but it is just as bad.

Through this whole process I’ve learned a ton about myself, but also about networking and self-marketing. Sadly, attractive, slender women really do make it further in the corporate world.

That said, this unfortunate reality, when paired with my new-found career commitment, has been a great reason to invest in myself and my appearance, which feels good.

My personal opinion is that we worry too damned much. We push push push the kids to do things they aren't quite developmentally ready to do, we freak out when they pick their noses or they don't quite make it to the toilet, we spend too little time letting them explore and too much time standing over them making them practice perfect penmanship.

You’d think that a tall, beautiful girl at the game table for a change would generate some interest, but these guys were just too into how they did it at Aero (or maybe they didn’t know how to deal with a female gamer who didn’t look like Janet Reno) so In retrospect I guess it wasn’t Paul’s fault, although we never once got so much as a “so what are you’re characters doing?”. Young people, who these games were ostensibly aimed at, got no props at Aero. It was adults playing games and the young’uns be damned, unless you were one of owner Gary’s little blond cabin boys he got to watch the register now and again (I think one of those grew up and eventually bought Aero from Gary before he passed a few years ago). Thankfully, a couple hours of being ignored at the table ended when one of my high school friends showed up and asked us to hit the mall with him and we got gratefully the hell out of there to go have fun. That was the last time I actually sat in on a game at Aero I think. I was outgrowing it. Moving on to my own groups, and to non-gaming related activities. This was one of my experiences at Aero that shaped me as a GM. In this case, I would always make sure and give lots of time to other players no matter what character was shining at the moment. Actually, now that I think of it, most of my good qualities as a GM comes from doing the opposite of things I experienced in those old games at Aero.

Well, maybe not that last one, but I can tell you this; it’s brutal, man.

The Hebrew version of the name of the city and the tower, Babel, is attributed in Genesis 11: 9 to the verb ‘balal’, which in Hebrew means to confuse or confound. In Part 2 of this series I briefly touched on the topic of the Tower of Babel, and pointed out that the Bible (Genesis 11:1-9) tells us that these people who built the city and the tower in that region originally came FROM THE EAST, -- the same region where Cain dwelt after he was banished from Eden – (Genesis 4: 16).
Three seconds into opener ‘Rise’, and you know this is going to be special. The fierceness that runs throughout the album is not merely a characteristic, but a method, an indictment, exorcism and history lesson. That Roberts manages to unite a universal message and the intensely personal is one of the album’s most striking merits, while combining free jazz, swing, folk music (spirituals, lullabies, the blues), the Bible and the oral tradition to accomplish a musical equivalent of Toni Morrison’s stories.

Anyway, Shazz has this incredible store and invited me to do a "sistah show" with her. She will be showing her incredible photography and I will show some paintings. I borrowed some of her outstanding photos for inspiration. I am not trying to copy her incredible photos verbatim, but I am trying to add some of my recollections of growing up at "the shore". It was a huge part of becoming me and even though I am currently landlocked, the ocean, the dunes, the marshes and the boardwalk will always be part of me. As this show will be at the shore, I felt it appropriate to paint along with that theme.

Where did this difference of opinion come from? Well it’s obviously not in the definition. Breaks are temporary. That’s self-explanatory. So the fault must lie with the woman. I’m not saying this to be sexist. It’s just true. A lot of women blow things out of proportion just to create drama. (Some don’t, but allow me to generalize for a moment. I will try to refrain from inclusive statements.)Why do you think reality TV is still on the air? Men don’t care about that crap!
What you can win? Ahh, as usually we have the smashing $20 voucher up for grabs if you use a TPS image on your creation. We really would love to see more of using them so we can give away our vouchers. If you use another brand of image the prize will be three digis of your choice. That's nice too, even if you get so many more images for the $20 voucher. :)
As others have said, we must go to war with the Mitt we have, which is true. But, when he leaves the reservation, someone must call him on it. For if we do not, it wont matter who is elected come this November as either candidate will be indistinguishable.

She is alone. At first, she feels fear, she observes the darkness, she wants to escape out of the darkness of the house, but even outside is still solid dark. She feels as her view is covered from a dark thick veil. There is nothing out of the door, out of the window, there is nothing to be seen inside the house. She is alone.

Some of these books will be featured in the book of the month for Trunk’d Clothing and I will write a blog on what I learned from those books. I am doing the research so you don’t have to. However, if someone has already read any of these books or are going to in the future please leave feedback. I would love to hear what others have to say.
No, the MU/KU divide, like the Missouri/Kansas divide, was birthed in the good old days of slavery, and those heady pre-Civil War days of border raids, murder of innocents, and burning of villages to the ground. (I'm going to apologize in advance to my History Major Friends - and you know who you are - for putting forth what is a total simplification of the facts. The lateness of the hour, and the limits of my patience, forbid me from telling the whole story. But I'll try to sum it up as best I can. If I get anything very very wrong, tell me, and I'll amend it.)
Floyd joins Justin Blackmon and Kendall Wright as the 3rd WR the Panthers have had visit, as they have now spent three of their 30 allotted visits on the receiver position. While that may seem like a drop in the bucket those thirty visits are spread across all prospects so investing a high portion of them in receivers who could be available at #9 is telling.
A look at the experience of the 1980's shows that, in fact, in those old heavy industrial areas, where deindustrialisation, and the collapse of industries such as Mining, Steel Making, Shipbuilding etc. occurred, women's employment fared significantly better than that of Men. It was not just the fact that female labour-power was cheaper to buy for Capital, but that frequently in the new, light industrial production that was established, and certainly in the new service industries, female labour-power was more productive than male labour-power. It was often not discrimination from Capital, that women faced in these areas, but from working-class men. Certainly, there is evidence that where women became the main or only breadwinners in these areas, it did not result in a significant reduction in their domestic workload to compensate. An intersting discussion and analysis in this respect is provided by Jane Wheelock in “Capital Restructuring and The domestic economy: Family Self-respect and The Irrelevance of 'Rational Economic Man” (Capital & Class 41, Summer 1990). A look at the preponderance of female labour-power in the State Capitalist sector, which grew markedly from the late 1980's through to 2010, particularly in these areas, is an indication of that. State Capital located to these areas, partly in order to offset, the effects of deindustrialisation, which could have had long-term consequences for the economy as a whole, but also to take advantage of cheap labour thereby providing itself with an alternative to the astronomical costs facing businesses located in London.

Don’t judge your process or the processes others are going through. Judgments and spiritual arrogance have no place in these times. All are a perfect mirror of God . . . including YOU. Remember . . . what you resist, you can never be free from, so allow, surrender and flow with the process. AGAIN … what you resist, you can never be free from. Allow your story to unfold. Remember that where you have been, and what you have experienced, good or bad, has placed you where you are today. Just a quick look back will remind you how much you have grown. Don’t you see how much you have already evolved! Don’t forget this.

Springtails are part of the order Collembola. Organisms belonging to this order are generally smaller than 6 millimeters (0.2 in) in size, and have 6 or fewer feet attached to their thorax. They also have additional spring-like organs attached to their abdomens that enable them to leap out of harm’s way in the event of any attack by predators.
I loved Pam though. She and her car dealer husband Peter, equally tanned but with a head of distinguished grey hair, were old friends of my parents. They'd all known each other since they were teenagers. She was a major part of the school run, and she'd offer fags to us over her shoulder, knowing we wouldn't take them. She was also really kind to me when mum and dad moved abroad, and for that I'll never forget her.

So I was up at the crack of dawn (actually way before dawn 4:15 a.m.) to do INSANITY – plyometric cardio. Not fun. I grabbed a half of a 5 hour energy before starting. I am not sure it helped with the workout, but I was BUZZING when I got to work around 8. I don’t drink much caffeine and could tell why after this morning.

This morning, as on most Saturdays, I took to a well worn 3 kilometre track to the beach for my morning run. My plan was better to get it over and done with before the morning heat really set in. At least I could then feel that I was starting to get on track in preparing for the challenge of the half marathon in Melbourne in October. Our son (who is a runner) and his fiancee (who is a triathlete) are to do the whole marathon. For me, I quite like the idea of a challenge and half the distance would certainly be enough!
The dog in front was kicked in the head by a cow and the owners were worried about neurological damage. Everything was ok. Unfortunately later it turned out that the eye had been affected and had to be removed via surgery. That was fine and healed beautifully. We removed the stitches in the morning and then in the afternoon, poor sweet doggy came back to us because he’d been attacked by two dogs! The wounds weren’t too bad but the little guy had to be stitched up again.

In a letter accompanying the receipt of these 3 volumes at the RADNET office December 9, 1996 and responding to RADNET inquiry about deep-well injection of high-level waste, the DOE responded “I would like to emphasize that the Department has never injected high-level radioactive waste resulting from weapons manufacturing or reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. … There are several sites where low-level and hazardous liquid wastes were injected as a method of isolated disposal. These are at Test Area North at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho, the Hydrofracturing Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and 200 area reverse wells at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, Washington. … In addition to the deep-well injection sites as source points, several sites had shallow burial, seepage basins, or spray irrigation methods of disposal.” William E.

From what rumors say you hooked up with Kanye West in the meantime and you’re thinking about marriage! After what? Six weeks? Geeeeeez, Miss Kardashian, I thought you had at least a weak trace of intellect… but it seems I’ve been wrong… I’d just like to ask you one thing: how do you think this would end? In another emergency divorce? I would strongly guess: yes! Let me tell you one thing Ma’am: If you are going to do this I personally would develop one of those “car stickers” saying: “Hoot if you haven’t been married to Kim Kardashian”.
Today, I went running alone. Mag called and said her knee was hurting her and that she wanted to let it rest. I was bummed, but Monsieur Titi convinced me to go by myself. I did 6+ kilometers (about 4 miles) in 1 hour. I took it nice and slow and it was good.

The problem is there is simply too much to watch, too many little things going on on the screen: the main screen with the anchor or the reporter, the double or smaller screen if one of them is talking to someone, the lower-third screen where they run the headlines about the other stories you supposedly need to know about, but they aren’t covering, and then, if you’re really lucky, you get another lower third screen that gives incoming tweets in teeny, weeny font from people watching who are commenting on one or maybe even two of the other stories.
Friday night, my phone rang. I don’t even know why I actually bought a Sun SIM just because she asked me. Well I didn’t have a hard time being a friend to her. Being a friend to you is the problem. So I answered, thinking it’s her. By the way, Malou, sorry if I have to tell this. It’s not to start another argument between you two but to throw my unnecessary baggage that I was supposed to have done before 2009 ended. But anyway, this will not affect you or what you have.

This weekend we also made it up to Newport Beach. You loved having a bit of our fish burgers, but you did NOT like the after effects of the sand. The sand at that beach is REALLY sticky, very hard to wash off. You spent the whole car ride home looking for any spec of sand still stuck to your feet then you'd hold it out to me and yell until I picked it off.
If any more find homes, they will reappear on this blog, and I shall pop in from time to time to tell you what's happening with all the others.

This past summer, I purchased 2 large square black plastic urns - which I love. They're super durable - and have that tapered craftsman appeal that we're after for our home. In July I filled them with red & green overflowing potato vines - and this winter they're filled with greenery clipped from our property - and some tall birch logs my hubby brought home from visiting his brother Up North (Matheson ON)!

Born in South Salem in 1919, Bennett served as a major in the Pacific during World War II, painting the scenes he saw whilst fighting (he also suffered a broken back). He studied fine art at the Institute of Chicago and graphics at the American Academy of Art, and did advertising work for Pepsi and Buick before switching to book covers. But beyond his commercial career, Bennett was becoming an accomplished and respected painter. In 2008 the RiverSea Gallery in Astoria, Oregon held a restrospective exhibition of Bennett's paintings, to act as a farewell to the local artist, who was moving to the east coast. Follow that link and you'll find a few fine examples of his work, along with a profile which reveals that when Bennett arrived in Oregon in 1986 he experienced something of an artistic epiphany, over the next two decades painting hundreds of pictures of the people and places from the local area.
I know I said I was getting back to rankings, but there is still a lot of time left before the calendar year is done, and there’s an interesting debate on the floor.

So, at my earliest convenient time to set about buying some, I did just that. All for the sake of vanity. My daughter helped me select the correct ones. I didn’t go for the really thick ones, nor the sparkly ones. I didn’t want people to notice that I was wearing them. I just wanted them to be life like. I bought just the pair.

Marsha Ambrosius began her post-Floetry solo career in earnest as an artist signed to Aftermath Records, which meant guesting on tons of huge Dr. Dre-produced hit rap albums but never releasing one herself. After half a decade on the shelf, though, she finally got the same itch that all Interscope artists stuck in Jimmy jail get, and left to restart her career elsewhere, and finally landed a couple of hit solo singles (including the instant classic "Far Away") and released a terrific album. The covers on the album feel a bit forced as statements ("Butterflies" to remind us that she wrote Michael Jackson's last great single, "Sour Times" to remind us that she's British), but the thing still holds together really well as a consistent listen.
So, overall, this past weekend has been an amazing adventure in antiques and boutiques! I finished my bar cart too and made t-shirt grocery bags (I'll show pics of those later too).

I’m the kind of reader that really can only manage novels about the human race – I never could manage “Gormenghast”, or any fantasy of any kind – so the novelists I relish most are those of the nineteenth century – George Eliot, Thackeray, the real Trollope, the Brontes – who were so psychologically insightful, as well as all the modern ones who have the same fundamental empathy for their fellow men. And I’d cite all the ones I’d give to Jane Austen, plus Hilary Mantel, Georgina Harding, Ann Patchett, William Boyd, J.G.Farrell – I could go on and on….

There's a pit in my stomach, because I know this. I know there's been a final goodbye. I know cell phones still allow some contact, some last minute I love yous, and text messages read "still waiting," "heading for the plane," and "will be in touch ASAP." I know the phones will then probably be put away for the next year, and the next word will come from Germany, through email and Facebook. It might be tomorrow. It might be a couple of days.
Today, as I walked across the park I saw a talk lanky Puerto Rican shadow boxing amid the blooming dogwoods, the forsythia and hordes of young women about to bring forth new Upper West Siders. I saw dogs cavorting and chasing. Kids of all ages on their way to school. And well-abbed runners ripping across the asphalt.
I let my sister read it and she said it was worded perfect, professional and to the point. This is all business right now. I sent them at 7 am. I have received no emails for a couple of days and so far, no answer to these emails.
I didn’t stop there. I went on and said, “The eagle has landed.” But no, all my clients–and readers–would be so disappointed with that. Because that’s so cliche. So I left everyone with a final thought. I said The tiger has roared. And in that simple phrase–all encrypted because I couldn’t see it–I thought about how brilliant I am because, don’t you get it??? Tigers don’t roar!!! Lions do.
Remember the Iowa Tests that we had to take in elementary school? I do. I remember the preparation, then the actual taking of the tests (it took DAYS) and then anxiously awaiting scores and wondering what they meant as far as my "smarts" went and how it would affect the teacher I'd be assigned to next year, the reading groups I'd be placed in, and mostly...what my parents might think. Yikes. Way too much stress for an elementary school child if you ask me.
This is just one of a multitude of projects I've got planned to get our Master Bathroom up to par. Every time I walk into Kalia's nursery, I'm jealous that she's got a nicer room than us!
As for its use in animal feed, European health officials have debated whether the canthaxanthin added to the feed to give farmed salmon their pink hue poses any human health risk. The European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) issued a warning several years ago about the pigment and urged the industry to find an alternative. In 2002, SCAN reviewed the maximum levels of canthaxanthin in fish feeds and determined that the allowable level of 80 milligrams of canthaxanthin per kilogram in feed was too high, and that consumers who ate large amounts of salmon were likely to exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.03 milligrams per kilogram human body weight. In 1997, the EU’s Scientific Committee on Food recognized a link between canthaxanthin intake and retinal problems, so in April 2002, SCAN suggested lowering the level of canthaxanthin to 25 milligrams per kilogram in feed for salmonids (baby salmon). To date, no government has banned canthaxanthin from animal feed.

I make no apologies for the inclusion of Har Mar Superstar and do not claim him as a ‘guilty pleasure’ - he is brilliant.

I don’t really know who has self-selected to respond on these websites, and I think it would be easy to dismiss them as a relatively small, immature, ignorant segment of the population. But are they? What sorts of influence do they have? How many women in their lives are subjected to this sort of language and the attitudes driving it? And I’m not saying these are all men excusing Gibson and those like him. What does it mean that so many are unconcerned by this behavior? Or that of Charlie Sheen? Or at least not concerned enough to raise their voices. 19 out of 20 people had no problem with his words. And more than that when you factor in the later article.

At supper when Jesus takes, blesses, breaks and gives them the bread, they recognize him, then almost immediately lose him again as he vanishes. The Emmaus story teaches us once again that we do not possess Jesus. Not when we gather at table around Scripture and the Breaking of Bread. Not when we invite him into our homes and our hearts.
That is precious, and practical. I can see using it at dressy dinners aboard ship, at casino roulette table in the evening when I don't want to have a purse in the crush of the crowd.
During the meal, we chatted and at one point I asked Mark how he could be a Christian and yet much of his tour schedule consisted of playing at rowdy bars. Mark made reference to the Gospel passages that tell how Jesus went to be among the publicans and the sinners. He said that he wanted to minister to the people that really needed it and not so much to play in churches. His mission was to save lost souls. He knew that he still had a large fan base from the Grand Funk days and many of those fans frequented bars. If he was there with them, he might have the opportunity to minister to them. This sounded like a good answer to me.

War with the Vrun Colonies has primarily consisted of a winter offensive of guerilla warfare, with Fort Greenpennant starting its own 'Hardpoint' cantons/mini-forts, and saboteurs introducing a blight to Xudorn's hydroponics lab. The Black Crown has shared the forging process of the Bright Metal, in exchange for a leg-up on Zeppelin technology. The local tribe of Abbekqorru have been fully integrated into Xudorn, and a ship load of Durn have immigrated to her shore as well.

This argument, which reflects the case’s more general “Blame-Another-Defendant” strategy, at the very least would imply that discovery should continue forward, to determine which Durham employees fed the spokesperson this false and malicious material, which he then unthinkingly parroted to the local, state, and national media. Yet the Durham attorneys cite this version of events as an argument for why the case should be immediately terminated before any discovery occurs.

This year I have written a "Fruit of the Spirit" curriculum for our scripture study together. It's hardly a new idea, but every month of the school year we take a different "fruit" and memorize scripture that ties to it. The kids also have a "Fruit of the Spirit" Journal that they write in nightly.
"Emotions have a collective existence" that is, how you feel is also dependent on "not just your choices and actions, but also on the choices and actions of people...who are one, two and three degrees removed from you." (Pam Bellack, New York Times, Dec 4, 2008) That is, we tend to imitate what others are doing even at a cellular level (mirror neurons). If we are around negative people, we tend to become negative. If we are around people setting a good example, we tend to follow it. This leads to the point of "No Kidding About Bullying" by Naomi Drew, that children can be taught empathy, compassion, and the social skills needed to combat a bullying atmosphere.
Firstly loose the detail. Yes people and hands are difficult to draw and we all struggle with them if you try to capture the details. If you think of people as stick people. It gets a lot simpler.

I’m going to be a bit spotty in posting the next few weeks. 19 days and counting down to the wedding!! Julie is really stressing because the G8 summit will be at Camp David on May 18th and 19th and they are warning people about the traffic mess Frederick will be. She’s getting married outside Frederick. We are praying all of the whack-a-doodle protestors stay home!!

Christ is found when we have confessed our sins and listened attentively to the teaching of the gospel, the bread of everlasting life, meditated upon it and rooted it firmly in our hearts, so that we may fulfil it by good works and proclaim it to others that they may observe it also.
My trip now seemed feasible. Finances were in place. Costs on accommodation had come down to almost zero. I was looking forward to meet fellow travelers, share stories and experiences with them. Amid all this calculated chaos, were requests pouring in from travelers who’d be coming to Chennai anytime soon and were expecting me to host them. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning but I thought, why not. So I accepted my first guest, David Villiger from Switzerland. That’s all I knew of him. And I don’t regret that day. It was a beautiful experience getting to know him and getting to know more people like him. Since then, there has been no looking back. I have had the pleasure of meeting people from different backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities. With so much differences, we share one thing in common – our love to travel and meet like minded people.
Or most of the countries in Asia. Russia. China.

I'm so excited to announce that I have been asked to design needle felting projects for Clover Needlecraft, Inc.!!! The past few days have been very busy, as I have just completed several designs for Clover's project sheets. It's an awesome opportunity to publish some of my work with a wonderful company. Ahhh, yes, and on top of all that, I was provided with an ample supply of Clover's outstanding felting tools and roving to work with. I'm like a kid in a candy store! To think, before working with Clover, I did all of my needle felting projects with a single non replacable barbed needle! Clover's tools utilize several needles, or you can use just one if you like...the point is, there are options. This was also my first experience working with Clover's felting brush pad, which, again was SO much better than my foam cushion (the needles don't get stuck in the felting pad!).
My mom has been ill, and is now in the hospital. For the last 3 years, in addition to caring for our families, my sisters and I have been taking care of the lady who brought us into the world...
Of all the moments that sparkle in my life, this one is unexpected and yet the dearest. Tomorrow we bury my father. My mother, sister, brother and I greet the visitors for the ritual viewing. Some people we know and some we don’t. Even so, each one has something to share–a story, a tiny piece of my father that I didn’t know. Each one smiles, some cry . . . but everyone smiles. He taught me. He pestered me to come to class. He encouraged me to race faster than I thought I could. He helped me. I’ve always loved my father, but I’ve never been prouder.

Would I recommend The Fab Pore Hot Cloth Cleanser? Of course! I didn't think the cloth made that much of a difference personally, as flannels seem to do the job just as well. I think the cloth is softer and less harsh, but don't quote me on that. I find my face looks brighter after using it and of course, it's much softer! The tube is convenient and it's also easy to slip into a washbag or something if you're going away, so there's no excuse for not having a "Fab" complexion!
Although, I worked for a private company, without really being involved first hand with its own charitable institution, I think I contributed by investing and organising activities and events which catered to the employees’ well-being. Employees are people who get stressed a lot, after all. Yes, I got paid to do what became a task that I learned to loved. Still, it’s fulfilling to see how much of a success your project is and most especially, how it somehow touched the employees’ lives.

I really enjoyed Game of Your Life, but I couldn't get my almost 16 yr old boy interested. After viewing it, I believe he will really want to watch it b/c he's such a gamer. Maybe he'll tune in on the second~I think it's GREAT and most kids will like it.

And man was there a storm yesterday. I don't know how many of you experienced it, but I got some of the really heavy rain. No tornados touched down here, but I saw a picture of a high school completely destroyed.

This concert was staged in the larger but far less salubrious environs of the O2 Hall, a domed monstrosity on the South bank of the Thames at Greenwich. That this pile sits even close to Greenwich Park makes it even more of an eyesore.
Obviously my adjustment back to site after more than 2 weeks away was really difficult. Everyone seemed to think I was still sick, and I guess I was, but I didn't want them to think that. They've been really nice and helpful though. My host mother has served me chicken more in the last month than all of the previous ones combined. She lights mosquito coils next to me while I eat dinner, and puts the fan on me to blow the mosquitoes away when we relax in the living room. I've had so many people in our community ask me how I'm feeling, and if I'm still sick. It's so nice to see that the Khmer people care about you.
VG: I can’t answer this question - I am not sufficiently well read in comtemporary fiction that deals with the female experience. Why? Because I am a living female. I read to escape the actuality of everyday life, not to look in a mirror.

When something is looming large in your mind, or you are at odds with somebody over some issue, try to take that step back and gain some perspective. Take a deep breath, allow yourself to consider another angle and look at the measure of importance with an objective eye.

M followed me into the laundry room. Then she got bored. And when M gets bored it usually means trouble of some kind. Today was no exception. She crawled into my bedroom and started playing under DH's desk. Normally, I don't mind - she has toys scattered throughout every room, and she usually pulls one to her choice sitting spot and entertains herself. Except that today, she somehow managed to get tangled up in a lamp cord.
Yet, he recognized that differences will always exist and that such differences are part of the foundation of a democracy. “We will argue about everything,” Obama said. I appreciated that the President emphasized that point, that freedom of speech point.

With Classic Constructed, you need to make a Deck (minimum 60 cards, not including your hero) with all the cards that ever came out. Even though this may seem easier than the Core Constructed, personally I don’t think it is. You can actually get the best cards of every set possible and turn them into a really good deck. For a beginning player, I find this really hard as you would need to start buying the specific cards or you need to be able to trade them with someone else (another option is of course buying the boosterboxes if they are still available but this would cost a lot of money).

This is the essential charter school model and the money is all the rationale its promoters need. Think about it. There’s a trillion dollars a year spent on public education in the U.S. and enterprising investors want to get their meat hooks on it. Where else in the world can you find a $1 trillion opportunity that is essentially untouched? Not in automobiles. Not in health care. Not in weapons, computers, banking, telecommunications, agriculture, entertainment, retail, manufacturing, housing. Nowhere.

Point St. Benedict’s Winter Ale (reviewed by DP)—Great label, with a likeness of St. Benedict reading an illuminated manuscript by candlelight. The beer pours a beautiful rich brown with a slight orange cast. Clean nose with just a hint of clove. But the taste, alas, does not match up with the look. The bittering is out of balance and is a bit too aggressive. But the real problem is a pronounced, lingering astringency in the mouth and on the finish. They had to have tasted this at the brewery. I think they got some tannin extraction on this one and couldn't bring themselves to dump the whole batch, so they just went ahead and bottled it up anyway. Bad move and quite unpleasant. I dumped out more than half the bottle. St. Benedict definitely deserves better than this. Rates 0 out of 10. (Reviewed by DP)

When I read laments about the white farmers, I remember the story that when some of our area (altitude 6500 feet) was rezoned for white farms, the people were sent to an area which was only 3000 feet in altitude....and a couple dozen ended up dying of cerebral malaria.

We know this from Germany, most recently famous Protestant cleric Margot Kaessmann publicly said she prefers to pray for the Taliban instead of fighting or bombing them. This is the German way of love and peace with those who love death and destruction.
I am aware of some police interventions with people under the influence of cannabis which have lead to them being admitted to a hospital on the grounds of being mentally ill. I am aware that some of those led, just a few days later, to the person being released from care because the effects of drugs had worn off and it was no longer believed that they sufferred from a mental disorder. (I am also aware of a case where this occurred after a man drank a bottle of red wine having also taken over-the-counter medication to assist him to stop smoking – the two things produced a chemical effect which made him present to police officers as if he were mentally ill. The MHA assessment team agree and detained him s2 MHA.)
Christine, at the prompting of her neurologist, resorts to a ploy that Mike Befeler's elderly protagonist Paul Jacobsen also uses in the geezer lit cozy RETIREMENT HOMES ARE MURDER (published 2007), keeping a journal on a daily basis. The journal becomes his memory. In Christine's case she records what she is told as well as what happens to her. So this "memory" is imperfect as well.
9) Made an after work trip to Walmart. Now since living in a much more civilized area of the country, I have Kroger's everywhere I can throw a stone. But at 1030 - no such luck. So I mosey into my local Wally World and they are in the process of restocking and people and lifts and pallets of enormous portions of product are everywhere. I get my Aspercreme (my knees after Grandpa's Ridge are a major concern) and knock off 7-up and a get well card for a pal and head for the check out line. There is not one! It's all self check out. Two young and handsome kids tell me to go ahead of them because I have less stuff. Oh such cute little hunks! Chivalry in the South! Who would have thought it still survives.
But then there's that training issue. If the longbow becomes an ultimate weapon, what are all the players going to make to maximize their character's damage output? Yeah, that one is pretty much a no-brainer. It's game balance on a generic and bland scale but its necessary in some forms.

Then, zig zagged stitched all the way around the perimeter.The gift for the baby boy was a set of four bibs using two different rocket ship fabrics, flannel and terry cloth.

I was fortunate to attend the 24th International Montessori Congress in Paris several years ago. I recently re-read my notes on the various lectures. Those on Lynne Lawrence's talk (current Director of AMI) regarding the sensorial materials highlight the significance of the work I outlined in the above paragraphs. She states, “in the simple act of pairing...the child questions whether two sensory impressions are the same or different, makes a decision, acts upon this decision and bears the consequences of this judgement. At the same time the child may revise this decision when faced, later, with a final pair that do not match.” She concludes, “The activity...strengthen(s) their ability to make choices and act upon their own judgements and decisions.”
Not because you get to accomplish what is expected of you on a daily basis you are already ‘more productive’. Being as such lies is introducing something new or extra. It could be a new or an improved process, a solution to a problem or difficulty, a resolution to a challenge, an answer to a long-time-unanswerable question, addressing of a concern, or fixing of an issue.
So far there has been a very encouraging response. We are already at over 20% and there are a couple of good potential developments that could make a significant difference as investors and Trusts consider possibilities.
Horace Greeley said "Go west, young man," but the singer of this song's advice is "Go underground, young man." Is he saying the best strategy for dealing with life in the ghetto is to give up and drop out? Become a drug user or even a drug dealer to escape the frustrations of ghetto life?

We tried everything... There was just too much damage that was done. I was spending more time sleeping alone in a separate room, than together... She and I never did anything together anymore, and trying to go somewhere together, usually lead to an argument in the car on the way. In almost every case, my resentment for her not supporting me in my transition could NOT be let go. In almost every case for her, my transition was something to use as a trump card to arguments.

If you were really being a silly arse about it, of course, you released your favoured band's single in competition with another band covering exactly the same song, meaning somebody had to lose (or both did) in a rather unusual battle of the bands contest. In this case, The Spectrum's studio clock-watching yawnfest of a cover of The Beatles already quite uninspired "Ob La Di Ob La Da" went head-to-head with The Marmalade's slightly less dreary version. The public must have been thrilled to have had three Ob La Di Ob La Das in the same place at the same time*. The Marmalade went to number one and subsequently lasted a few more years despite hippies screaming "sell out!" in their faces, whereas The Spectrum's effort flopped, and they didn't trouble us for much longer.
I blamed myself. Someone had told me at appraisal that I lacked confidence and while I didn’t believe it the first time I heard it, gradually it became the only excuse I could find to justify what was happening to myself. Every time I didn’t speak up, there was the proof! “That’s because you lack confidence,” said the voice inside my head.
If you stumbled in here through a Facebook link that I’ve (finally) shared with some of you people I know (and I should mention that I’m NOT sharing this with everyone, so go ahead and feel a bit special right now), you might want to read the Sharing and connecting post.

To read about an issue that has made my life feel empty and useless in recent times, check out this post (especially towards the end) and this one. There’s quite a lot of other related and unrelated stuff in here that I’ve written in the past two months. They tend to be quite long. And I’m not apologising for that, in case you thought so

The more we get acquainted with the actions that we take that are abusive, the quicker we can become aware of the steps needed to stop these interactions. I pray for a day when cyber-bullying isn’t an issue, but until that day, the best step is to be made aware that it is one. On the site there’s also a game available to play too called Alex WonderKid Cyber Detective.
In the early 1970s The Funkees were the number-one east Nigerian band and the only outfit to seriously challenge the popular Lagos based rock combos MonoMono and BLO. Stoking the dancefloor was the young band’s first priority and The Funkees were often playing through the night, seven days a week.

She got really excited - not in a good way - and, although a lot of words came out of her mouth, the only ones I remembered were "Shoulda, woulda, coulda!" It was such a strange response. I think I then said to her "Well, maybe next time", which is an even stranger response because 1) I didn't give her a card, so she would have had no way to contact me and 2) she had very clearly stated that it would be 16 years before she painted again. I'm not waiting 16 years to help her.

I like to plan, don’t get me wrong; seriously this German does not need an excuse to go list-tastic and bust out Excel spreadsheets but I don’t really think about where I’m going to be in 10 years.

I want to be the soldier. I want to touch, to hug and to love people that think they are too dirty for such human touch. It is like a magnetic pull in the core of my chest to love like this. I don't know how it's going to happen but I feel like it is. Not only was I born this way, my life of not feeling love is my greatest teacher on what people need and how to give love to them in a way they can feel.

This time they gathered together all their pieces, and used all their cunning in making them change the rules in such a convoluted way that the game seemed to transmute from a mere game into reality itself and eventually into something else altogether, far beyond both game and reality. But there were still no contradictions, just new rules. The Oracles tried again, and again. The rules became an immense cathedral of logic, but still without any flaw.
Well, as time went on the fights got more serious and blood was eventually shed - sometimes in copious quantities. We decided that one of them had to go, and Spot made the culling decision easy. Spot had always been aggressive toward us and the kids, but for the most part he'd been all charge and no spur. His bloody attacks on Dinner, however, made us rethink the possibilities, and (with an outdoor wedding coming up on the property) we decided Spot simply had to go. As Ruby said in Cold Mountain, "I hate a flogg'in rooster. Let's put him in a pot."

R&R Concerts continues to produce high quality and highly regarded concerts for the RI community. The program is well-run and brings musical events that Island residents might not otherwise get to enjoy. The leadership of R&R Concerts has done a good job of expanding non-PPF funding sources. Despite the success of the program, the committee recommendation is a slight decrease from last year’s allocation.
My first complaint is the matter of witchcraft. I'm happy to accept that Elizabeth considers herself a descendant of a goddess - there was a great deal of paganism even once Christianity had been taken on board. What I am not happy about are the situations where Elizabeth and her mother influence events through the use of their witchcraft. These were HISTORICAL events! Henry Tudor's fleet was prevented from invading through bad weather - this was not due to witchcraft. I disliked the sensationalism of witchcraft being added to a novel that already had plentiful situations that could be taken with a pinch of salt, but that actually happened.

I still haven’t quite worked out whether that was a good or bad decision. On the plus side shoe trees have made a great difference to the way in which I store and care for my shoes. Polishing a shoe with a shoe tree in it is a very different proposition from one without. Moreover, there is no doubt that my shoes are in better shape since I have started using shoe trees. And while it is a minor thing I do get a little kick out of seeing my shoes neatly lined up in the closet, with the shoe trees inserted.
A new project! My good friend Karyn brainstormed this beauty and I was honored to be asked to join the group. Carnivalesque: The Travelling Blog Show features five writers, all with strong opinions and mad writing skills. Every Thursday, we hang out virtually at one of our blog-homes and discuss a topic - then open up the comments so others can weigh in! And it's not all about writing - or romance. The topics range from the arts to news to pop culture. Every week, a different host and a different topic. I'm excited by the possibilities.

It seems to be a win win because earthlings lose wait and the Adipose family grows in number. But something goes wrong and people literally start falling apart to create these little bubbas. RTD is interesting on the moral side of things. It ends with a memorable line. The Doc is asked if he will blow the Adipose up. ‘No, they’re babies. They can’t help where they came from.’ There’s one to ponder.

The Dunedin City Council is facing a billion-dollar bill to maintain existing water services over the next 50 years.

Our sponsor this week, MyGrafico, generously provided the Design Team with a lovely digi set to play with called "Lacey Frames." The set includes a variety of oval-shaped frames, and let me tell you, they make putting together a card such a snap! To make this card, I printed the frame on white cardstock, then layered it on to a piece of the hot pink cardstock. I then added a hot pink oval to the center, where I stamped the greeting in Versafine black ink. The patterned papers are from my scraps stash. I used one of my border punches by Fiskars to liven up just the corners of the polka dotted paper. In keeping with the challenge, I added a little floral and ribbon embellishment, with a pearl-topped hat pin tucked into the center of the ribbon behind the flowers.

I watched more Smallville than was probably good for me. I loved the heck out of the premise. Seeing Superman before he is impossible to stop, as he’s discovering his powers, and going through high school. The execution was often poor however, many patterns for the show quickly emerged and were repeated over and over again. After high school the show seemed to really derail its narrative momentum. So yeah, not top ten.

The higher dollar has clearly shown that it has the potential to impact important sectors of the economy. Many experts believe that Canada’s manufacturing sector has been damaged by a dollar that makes our goods less competitive in the key U.S. export market, as well as globally. Our manufactured goods are expensive and business revenues in Canadian dollar terms are lower. Meanwhile, high Canadian production and labour costs provide companies with more incentive to manufacture in the U.S., Mexico and Asia.

"Gorgeous" George Galloway has won a massive victory in the Bradford West by-election. The Respect party leader overturned a 5,000 Labour majority to take the seat with a 10,000 margin. This blog can only salute his indefatigability.
Raising these points in the discussion just elicited two reactions from the group: some were irritated and annoyed, and others were condescending and said that such claims were probably made by industry-sponsored researchers.
Initially cynical of the extreme good looks (and tales of very small swimming trunks....) I came to realise that behind the general gorgeousness was actually a total lack of pretention, a ready smile and a warm wit. He was friendly and helpful to everyone from the professional expats in the bar to the kid selling phonecards in the dusty street. While many of his compatriots were dismissed by the internationals as vain or boorish (usually by those weaker or less pretty!) he commanded universal respect and affection. And a fair bit of drooling.
Bethany Frankel is a three-time bestselling author, a popular TV reality star, successful businesswoman and devoted mom. She makes her fiction debut with Skinnydipping ($25.00, Simon and Schuster), a sexy and hilarious story of Faith Brightstone, an iconic aspiring actress just out of college who wants to conquer Hollywood and have all the perks of fame. Like so many others, her plans do not pan out as she gains a behind-the-scenes experience, suffers heartbreak, and abandons La La Land for New York. The resemblance to Frankel’s real life is unmistakeable. Faith is discovered at a fancy food show after establishing a business, becomes a reality TV star, and wins a contest for her own show. Frankel’s fans will jump at the chance to read this thinly disguised autobiographical novel. A unique look at life in Israel is provided by Sayed Kashua, an Arab who has enjoyed success there, having written two previous novels and as the creator of a groundbreaking Israeli sitcom, “Arab Labor”. He straddles two cultures and his novel, Second Person Singular, ($25.00, Grove Press) is about an Arab criminal attorney in Jerusalem who has a thriving practice in the Jewish part of Jerusalem. By chance, in a bookstore he picks up a book by Tolstoy that has a love letter in his wife’s handwriting. He is immediately consumed by suspicion and jealousy, and determined to find the book’s previous owner. This is a powerful novel of love and betrayal, a complex psychological mystery, and a searing dissection of individuals who live in a divided society.

And when I say Yankee, I mean New England High WASP of course. But today’s New England High WASP, while heir to the storied tradition of slender and tony, is a new thing altogether — not afraid of mixing an Ivy League education with a healthy dose of thrift store chic. At least I think this is the case. No one really tells me these things, as I’m from the Midwest — I’m left to surmise the state of modern WASPdom from reading GOOP (only a WASP could understand the appeal of that name for Gwyneth Paltrow) and J. Crew catalogs. But I think I pretty much get what’s going on here. Adapt or die, as evolutionary theory tells us, and the modern WASP is adapting nicely.
An example of this was recently detailed by the Guardian’s Claire Provost in an article regarding Sierra Leone.

Even for those with no idea of the general price of land in Africa, this sounds cheap.

Unfortunately, when many people are doing their best to promote understanding, some organisations are engaged in small circles, hindering the country’s opening up policy and progress. For example, a total of 76 Malay non-governmental organisations formed a consultative council, Majlis Perundingan NGO Melayu (MPM), to oppose Najib’s opening-up economic measures. They vowed to defend Malay rights and Islam in the country. In fact, many organisations in the country are narrow-minded.

People kept trying to prepare me for how soft and mushy my stomach would be after I gave birth, but I secretly thought, Not this old buckerina.

The importance of death in these stories as well as in other stories of the collection, including near death, suicide, and possible death (“Holding Her Hand,” “Man Overboard,” “She Suspects,” “Sparkly Blue,” “Feeling Like a Child Again,” and “The Lake at Dusk”) would seem to be a displacement for the way the Sphinx would destroy each person who couldn’t answer its riddle. Oedipus solves the riddle posed by the Sphinx, the answer to which is “Man,” and in the final story of her collection, Bailey as if clears up any remaining mystery as to what happened to “the threadbare girl” in the second part of the story by that name.

Commissioned in White is a light-hearted short novel in the Art of Love series. It ties up some of the loose ends from the first three installments while providing a taste of what is to come in books five and six. It begins where Captured in Ink left off…a few short weeks prior to Jessica and Will’s wedding. We experience Jessica’s fear of getting married after being single for so long and how she tries to cope with that fear through the use of medication on the happy day. The end result was an entertaining ceremony, if nothing else. We also delve more into Reesa and Shane’s abrupt marriage. While adjusting the house to accommodate one more person, Reesa finds her ten-year old wedding dress and feels sad that she never got to wear it after all those years. The dress’s existence gets out and there is talk of having a wedding after the fact so she can wear it. Reesa rejects the idea until her bestie Jillian convinces her otherwise. This wedding, however, ends slightly differently from the other Larson weddings in that the groom, not the bride, flips out. Shane nearly faints and nearly rips Reesa’s dress from her body as he goes down. Reesa also realizes just how much Shane does love her and breaks out of her cocoon, getting a tattoo and piercings to match her husband’s. On a lesser note, Carrie learns that her birth control is not effective against a Larson man, Brooke and Drake continue to spar with one another, while Jillian fights the attraction between her and Joseph.

Jesus’ call is a call to a cross-bearing discipleship. This type of discipleship really requires two things—the first of which is to deny self. But what does it really mean to deny one’s self? I believe that it means we must willfully go through a process of re-orientation. God must be the center passion of the soul. We see this in the first and greatest commandment as described by Jesus: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37 NIV). In other words, it’s God first not me first. For the believer, nothing should rival his love and devotion to God even if it means the denial of comfort or self preservation. And, when God does become the center passion for the soul, we find a love and grace that has the power to carry us through the uncertainties of this life. Yet the denial of self also means that one is living a life of sacrificial love. The follower of Jesus Christ is known by his or her love for others (John 13:35). And the greatest love is seen through the sacrifice of Christ himself (John 15:13).

The inside of the building didn’t match the exterior. It was situated in one of the low-lying areas of the Docks, where the flooding had yet to fully dissipate. The buildings around here were in such bad shape that nobody was willing to use them for shelter or venture inside to take things. On the inside, however, the place was reinforced with girders and beams. Pieces of sheet metal sat between the thick metal shafts and the exterior wall, with holes cut to accommodate the windows. Handles on the metal shutters suggested that the plywood could be moved aside in a pinch. At ground level, there were stacked sandbags of a slightly different make from the usual, with plastic stapled over each pile.

They had walked through various stores: Macy’s, Charlotte Reuse, and a few others, but Jane was a little too excited to really pay attention to what kind of dress she would actually want to wear for such an occasion. She’d never been to a formal party such as a prom. She was a flower girl in her mother’s wedding, when she married Tyler’s father, but she was only about 5 and never really remembered much of it. She told Jarrad that this was something she needed to do with her mother, not only because her mother’s opinions would be more than worthwhile but also because her mother would take such great joy in helping her find the best dress for her to wear. Before leaving the mall, Jane needed to find a restroom.

Somehow I think when taking pictures vertically or framing a photo in the portrait mode, a photographer is forced to focus more deeply in getting depth and perspective of the scenery as best as can be.

I’m not making this up: it was an ultra-compact manual journalist’s typewriter from the 1950s, an Imperial Aristocrat, that my sister had acquired for typing classes at school. I got hold of it aged 12 when she went to university, and hammered it so hard that the wire armatures connecting the keys to the type-arms began snapping. Parts were rare, so eventually my parents caved and bought me a newer, heavier, German portable (also manual) as a birthday present. I didn’t kill it, but over the next five years I wore a shiny spot on the space bar under my left thumb, which developed a corresponding callus."

Fukuda is a phenomenal writer, and I loved how he created this story using traditional vampire lore, changing a few aspects to make his story work, but holding true to the main ideas: sunlight can kill, human blood is for drinking, excessive speed is a must, though changing a few other traditions, such as looks—not all vampires are perfect, or beautiful by any means. I liked this aspect; it gave the vampires a more human quality, though they are vastly different based on the ways they interact with one another.
