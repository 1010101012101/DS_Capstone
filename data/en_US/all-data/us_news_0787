Regarding "Reduce city's wasteful spending, not employees' pensions" (Page B7, Saturday), Todd Clark seems to be arguing that the city's contribution of 23.9 percent of the fire departmental payroll proves that firefighters' pension costs have not skyrocketed. I disagree and believe that such pension contributions are indeed "stratospheric" if true.

McDonald deal with 'mayhem':Kalil said later in an interview that he wasn't close to making a decision — players have until mid-January to declare for the NFL draft —- but the episode illustrated the pressures and distractions that he and three teammates are facing as they decide whether to return for a final college season.

Mindful of the deeply flawed intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction that was used to justify the 2003 U.S. invasion of that country, the IAEA report goes out of its way to buttress the credibility of its findings. Investigators described documents leaked from Iranian weapons labs, interviews with foreign scientists who worked on the Iranian program and information gathered by foreign intelligence services as well as the agency's own on-site inspections at Iranian nuclear facilities. Taken together, the report is the strongest indication yet that Iran's drive to become a nuclear power has not abated.

"Clearly this trip is campaign related," Inhofe said in a statement released just after Obama signed the agreement. "We've seen recently that President Obama has visited college campuses in an attempt to win back the support of that age group since he has lost it over the last three years.

HIGH POINTS: The top has a dual zipper that opens both sides with one pull. I tucked my camera in the front, very handy for getting it out quickly. The inside of the top flap has mesh compartments that hold disks, batteries and chargers. There is enough room in the bag for it to be used as a handbag, too. The Velcro dividers may be reconfigured, and the interior is a light color, so it's not a black hole inside. A small, attached, zippered bag for personal items is included.

Mr. Dunn walked past a promising booth because he already knew the owner's prices were inflated. In a cramped stall where one vendor sported a bow-tie, newsboy cap and sock garters, the designer tried on a straw boater hat. It fit his own "pin head" snugly, meaning it would be too small for most actors—a constant challenge with clothes from the distant past, when humans were more petite. In another aisle, he paid $385 for a flowery chiffon dress with its ankle-length hem intact. It was a find, considering how many women hacked off their dresses in the mid-'20s when hemlines rose.

Lowell died in 1916, but his ideas about Mars flowered in ways he scarcely could have imagined. Thanks to the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and other science-fiction writers, popular belief in life on Mars was so pervasive that government officials asked radio stations to shut down broadcasts for a few days in 1922 and 1924, when Mars reached its closest approach to Earth, so they could listen for Martian signals.

Fernando Espinoza, a 27-year-old exercise rider for three years at the track, cleaned mud out from his Ford Explorer in a parking lot across from the backside Monday morning.

An examination of the eyes starts with inspection of the eyelids and skin around the eyes. Any discharge, inflammation, or hair loss should be noted. Next the surface of the cornea is examined for any cloudiness, redness, or imperfections. If the cornea seems dry, or if a lack of tear production is suspected, a Shirmer tear test can be performed. This test uses a small piece of filter paper that absorbs tear fluid over a 60-second period of time. Normal cats will produce more than 15 mm of tears in each eye during this time.

"The kids were paying attention," she says. "They were doing jumps. They were going from one end of the mat to the other when they were supposed to."
"It was more difficult for me," Ratliff said. "It's not easy to mention every horse in the race more than once in your call when there are 12 thoroughbreds in a short 5-furlong race.

"Thirty-two states have voted on the issue of defining marriage. Thirty-two states have voted in favor of traditional marriage," Nosef said. "Gov. Perdue is obviously out of touch with the voters of her own state and is trying to change the subject by attacking Mississippi.

"Only then would we open the doors to the area hiring list," Boneta said. He added that Mansfield workers would get priority over Michigan workers in transferring to Parma if there's enough work to go around.
The rendering of the Bible into languages other than Latin was one of the major disputes of the Protestant Reformation; John Wycliffe, the 14th century scholar the Orlando organization is named for, was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church for producing an English version of Scripture. At times, even particular translations can become so entrenched that believers reject the possibility of improvement, Beal said, noting that some American churches advertise themselves as "King James Only," referring to the Shakespeare-era English translation.
Frank Lloyd Wright designed hundreds of landmark buildings and homes during a prolific career that spanned more than seven decades. But in what is widely considered a first and only for the famed architect, Wright indulged a young boy's humble request for a dog house in 1956 and sent him designs for the structure.

The Tuscan-inspired food, crafted by Rodrigo da Silva, supports that feeling. It's straightforward and delicious, bringing in strong Italian reference points without hitting customers over the head. Florentine steak, for example, is what diners will find all over Tuscany; it's a huge T-bone - actually a porterhouse because the tenderloin is so large - with perfect grill marks encased in a glistening glaze of olive oil. It's placed on the plate with a wedge of lemon, and da Silva sprinkles lemon-dressed arugula leaves over the top.
Lakewood -- Officials in Lakewood want to know who carved a large swastika into a putting green over the weekend at Lakewood Country Club and why. County Supervisors are expected to offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case.
Cleveland and Ohio connections abound in the film. Besides Esselstyn, we hear the story of Dr. Joseph Crowe, director of the breast center at the Clinic, who has followed a vegan diet since he had a heart attack in 1996 at age 44 (though he was lean and healthy with no sign of heart trouble until his heart attack); Rip Esselstyn, who is Dr. Esselstyn's firefighter-triathlete son and author of "The Engine 2 Diet"; San'Dera Brantley-Nation, a Parma woman who has had her diabetes and hypertension treated by Dr. Esselstyn; and Dr. Pam Popper, founder and executive director of the Wellness Forum in Columbus.

Not only is Brewer enjoying a Super Bowl as a rookie, he’s doing it in his hometown. Brewer attended Arlington High School for his senior year and played football for the first time there. Despite the limited experience he showed enough potential to earn a scholarship to Indiana.
Pepper said if the O'Fallon measure passes, he'll try to get the City Council to change some provisions. One possibility, he said, is to exempt businesses that agree to maintain separately ventilated smoking and non-smoking sections.

Tired of the same holiday traditions? Is the neighbor's decoration aesthetic too Barnum & Bailey? Had it with the drunken Dec. 31 frat scene on the Las Vegas Strip? We took a gander across the West and came away with some dollar-wise travel that packs enough holiday cheer to please Scrooge.
9. Bill Haas, United States -- Haas will be trying to play his way out of a something of a funk when he tees it up this week in the Wells Fargo Championship. Since he holed a 43-foot putt on the second playoff hole to beat Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley in the Northern Trust Open, he has been unable to crack the top 25 in five consecutive tournaments. He might have hit bottom when he shot 74-74--148 to miss the cut by three strokes at the RBC Heritage in his last outing and could be ready to turn it around. ... Quail Hollow might be exactly the right place to begin his resurgence. Haas finished solo fourth there last year, ending up two strokes out of the playoff in which Lucas Glover defeated Jonathan Byrd. He opened with an 8-under-par 64 but could not break 70 the rest of the way. Haas missed the cut in three of his first five appearances in the Charlotte event, but he also tied for fourth in 2006, finishing five shots out of the playoff in which Jim Furyk beat Trevor Immelman. ... Thanks to a quick start to his season, which included a tie for fourth in the Farmers Insurance Open and two other results in the top 20, the defending FedEx champion does not have that much ground to make up in the standings despite his slump. He was at 11th last week, and his strong performance at Quail Hollow last year got him started on a second-half run that led to his victory at the Tour Championship.

Leyva was too young to remember Cuba, and he adapted to his new home so easily he actually forgot his Spanish one summer a few years after arriving.

In its own way, "Luck" is a masterpiece, but patience is required. That said, I still wouldn't place a bet on whether it will become a "Sopranos"-level sensation or draw only a small but passionate cult following. I wouldn't even lay a bet on whether I'll keep watching.

"It is so clear that this was a 17-year-old boy pleading for his life," Jackson said.

A few years ago, I began warning visitors to my lab that before they left, I was going to give them a hug. This scares some people, but I've found that my slightly eccentric announcement changes the depth of the conversation, making it more intimate, more engaging and more valuable to us both. I suspect that by forecasting a hug, I'm also signaling how much I trust the person, so I'm inducing a release of oxytocin in their brains. Those people, in turn, will connect better to others and treat them more generously. Nothing grander is required for a virtuous circle to begin.

Don Mahoney, curator at the San Francisco Botanical Garden, says there is a high likelihood your chimera will not repeat, or it could be a tendency, appearing only occasionally. But if it does repeat, it is worth seeing if it will stabilize. If another flower like this appears, tag the plant that has it.

Despite having been raised in the documentary film industry, Shaun didn't jump into it – he took a serendipitous route. Nor did his dad encourage him to go into the profession, a premeditated decision, albeit a wise one in hindsight.

One more thing Anderson said after firing Friedgen, and repeated several times over the next few weeks. He said he wanted the football program to go from “good to great.” At the time, I thought this was Anderson trying to be clever, if a bit cliched.

it, we have a Phase II/Plan B for raising the money. If that fails, we do have enough money to do one episode, a simple pilot, and take that on the selling circuit, but our chances are better with a six-episode set. We'll see what happens.

It was the first week of training camp, and already the Trail Blazers were in crisis.
Christie was greeted with a rousing welcome — even louder than the one Whitman received — when he entered the event. He proceeded to tell some of the war stories from his first year in office, the same ones he likes to repeat at rallies when he's home.

As is the case with many 20somethings looking to kill some ''down time'' at work, I've developed a pretty healthy relationship with the blogosphere. From daily reads to the love-to-hates, my routine involves a standing date with the half dozen or so on my Rolodex of favorites. These run the gamut from cooking adventures to vapid model types chronicling their daily ''my life is a catwalk'' shtick, to a few truly decent sites where I honestly care about what they have to say.

High among the problems with Senator McConnell's plan is how hard it is to explain. But basically, Republicans would give President Obama all of the responsibility for proposing specific spending cuts and for raising the debt ceiling three times up to $2.5 trillion over the next year. Mr. Obama would get his way unless a supermajority of Congress objected, so the GOP could vote against Mr. Obama without stopping him. Default would be averted without Republicans being forced to vote for tax hikes.

Gaultier never received any formal training as a designer. Instead, at the age of 17 he sent sketches to famous couture stylists. That paid off when Pierre Cardin hired him as an assistant in 1970. It was a humble beginning for the man who went on to run the house of Hermès and found his own maison. Now a fashion legend, he still demurred at the idea of a retrospective exhibit.

But though the Swedes eat their smorgasbord as a buffet with many small dishes, the Danes tend to do what they always do — put their food on bread.

Democratic State Chairman John Wisniewski, who led the Democrats’ redistricting team, said the possible decline of female lawmakers “is not a good thing” but speaks more to how political parties select their candidates than the way the map is drawn. “I would agree with their underlying argument that there should be more women in the Legislature,” he said. “The map, however, is gender-neutral.”

Studies show that breaking that 30 minutes up throughout the day has benefits as well, Janata added.

Ben Kiwanuka says spirits are high because “the pendulum has swung.” For years, it seemed, the family was caught in a twister of calamity. When the Giants reached the Super Bowl in 2008, Mathias was sidelined by injury. After saving his brother’s life, he suffered a herniated cervical disk in his neck that put his football career in jeopardy. As his brother lay with pins and screws and rods in his body, family members counseled Mathias to quit, before football left them with another broken man.
Heisman voters haven't chosen anyone like Thomas before. Southern California's Reggie Bush wasn't the special teams star that DAT is. The two wide receivers who have won – Michigan's Desmond Howard in 1991 and Notre Dame's Tim Brown in 1987 – didn't have any rushing numbers to speak of, although Howard's 19 receiving touchdowns and Brown's 34 punt returns for 401 yards and three touchdowns certainly catch the eye.

it's important to ask why. At the simplest level, it seems these new or returning churchgoers did not find what they thought they were looking for-comfort, answers, or maybe a stable sense of community-and so they drifted away again. Or maybe, if what they wanted was immediate solace, they did find it, and then they left because they'd had their needs met and they were ready to move on. I don't know. But I do think that our religious ways of speaking and public rhetoric about God were challenged in the aftermath of 9/11, and I'm not sure that all of us who are deeply committed to our faith traditions and institutions proved equal to the challenge.

It's a humble, slide-in transient-style entry to a property that is a textbook example of one of the metro area's most vexing growth problems. Elected officials, planners and environmentalists chant the litany of infill development and increased density. Use the land we have, they say, instead of jumping beyond the urban growth boundary onto farms or forests. It was a major issue in the election campaign for Metro Council president. Candidate Bob Stacey, who narrowly lost to Tom Hughes, pounded away on the need to develop within the boundary by cleaning up brownfields, finding new uses for old buildings and consolidating ownership of disjointed properties.

Fehling plays Goethe with gusto as a slight step above a mischievous schoolboy, grinning and goofing and having a big time of it -- this guy would write "Faust"? -- until his heart is broken and he goes into full-on mope mode. Bleibtreu is better as Kestner; he may be a scold, but that doesn't mean his heart can't be broken as well. Best of all is Stein, lovely as Charlotte, a free spirit in a buttoned-down era whose zest for life (and for Goethe) is infectious. You can certainly imagine two such different men falling for her -- and plenty of other men doing so, too.

"Anonymous" also sharpens its literary-lore blades to go after the myth and reality of the Bard in a period drama with more modern overtones. The twist is that the movie suggests all of those great plays were penned by Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, and that Will Shakespeare was not so much the Bard, but a beard, a mere front for de Vere's unending output and political messages.

Preparation for bias is not, however, the only way minorities talk to their children about race. The other broad category of conversation, in Harris-Britt's analysis, is ethnic pride. From a very young age, minority children are coached to be proud of their ethnic history. She found that this was exceedingly good for children's self-confidence; in one study, black children who'd heard messages of ethnic pride were more engaged in school and more likely to attribute their success to their effort and ability.

The job market is gradually improving, though not as fast as it had been. From December through February, employers added a strong 246,000 jobs a month. That figure sank to a weak 120,000 in March.

Dan Jenkins is equally proud of two things about his induction on May 7 into the World Golf Hall of Fame. First, that he will be just the third writer in the hall, and the first not to be inducted posthumously, a fate that the crusty 82-year-old is delighted to be avoiding. The other two are Bernard Darwin, grandson of Charles and a scribe for the Times of London from 1907 to 1953; and Herbert Warren Wind, who wrote primarily for the New Yorker from the '40s through the '80s.

If it has a central narrative, it may be the one about Jaz, his wife, Lisa, and their severely autistic 4-year-old son, Raj. But if the novel turns, in a certain sense, on Raj's disappearance in the desert, it also has to do with a more amorphous sort of dislocation in which we exist—no matter what we believe or where we come from—at the intersection of two worlds.
Some experts say that rising fuel prices can be explained by the fact that oil and gasoline are traded around the world. The U.S. and Europe may be curbing their petroleum use, but China, India and Latin America are not. Overall, world oil demand keeps growing.

Obviously, a dime wouldn't pay for $12 billion in improvements, but it would go a long way toward getting the state the $800 million annual investment a blue-ribbon commission recently recommended. That would not only get people back to work (and in construction trades, one of the worst-hit segments of the job market), but it would help the many businesses that depend on a functioning transportation system to earn their living.
Ice-cube candles are a craft from our parents' generation, but it's about time this obscure technique was resurrected. The process is very old-school - all you need is candle wax, a milk carton and ice cubes. The end result is a candle that has textured holes and grooves, so the light shines through as it burns. There are all kinds of variations, but we'll start with the basics.

Jean-Baptist Frédéric Isidor "Toots" Thielemans, who turned 90 on Sunday, is quite easily the most celebrated harmonicist in all of jazz. He is now the subject of a two-CD package, titled "Yesterday & Today," that serves as both a career retrospective and a collection of rarities. Mr. Thielemans's first instruments were the accordion and the guitar, and his initial influence as a jazzman was Django Reinhardt. The first tracks in the new set, including a "Woodchopper's Ball" variation in which he plays bebop licks with a swing-style big band, find him playing guitar; the earliest harmonica solos here derive from a 1950 session in Stockholm, by which time he'd already performed with Zoot Sims and Benny Goodman. In 1952, Mr. Thielemans began a seven-year tenure with pianist and fellow European George Shearing, which helped establish the Belgian as Adler's successor as the most famous "mouth organist" in the world.
"Cardiac catheterization is a test that allows the doctor to go inside the body using thin tubes that enter at the wrist or groin and connect to the heart," says Moreno.

To the denizens of the infield area (roughly 60,000, if you include the alcoholically comatose as well as the staggering semi-ambulatory), it is the opportunity to press all that flesh into an area of less than one square mile and bring a little Kentucky Derby charm to the moment — if you associate charm with too much alcohol, too few clothes, too much belligerency and too much earlier preparation time spent in the bathroom at home reading the Karate Gazette along with a host of other characteristics, which are considered socially redeeming only to defrocked troglodytes.

In this first quarter of 2012, we served 17 percent more people than we did in the first quarter of 2011. We're growing so much in what we're doing.

You might not be able to tell from what I've written what a fury I am in about the disgraceful actions of Reinharz and the board. I am a Brandeis alum, class of '69, and the Rose Art Museum, then one of the few museums in the country devoted to contemporary art, was instumental in the development of my interest in art and my subsequent career as an art critic. The highlight of my 4 difficult years at Brandeis - being a college grad in 1969 on an activist campus was no lark - was the seminar on the New York School I took with the Rose's director, William Seitz, who had been a legendary curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. To think that other students might not have the opportunity to discover the visual culture of their times at the campus museum makes me very very sad.

I never seek out "Field of Dreams" when I look through the TV schedule, but if I'm flipping through the channels and come across it, I'm a goner.

As much as the team likes Appalachian State wide receiver Brian Quick, whom the Rams took with the first pick of the second round, it's hard to imagine that they feel his presence alone will solve the team's wide receiver problems.

DG: I doubt the people who put a lot of time and effort into reporting, researching, watching and evaluating talent appreciate your view of the process.

Chef Rachel Speith works her imaginative treatments of high-end ingredients with a sure hand, such as her spot-on execution of seared foie gras presented with a warm lentil salad (less salt, please) and a jazzy herbed apple compote, the whisper of thyme playing perfectly against the fruit and fat liver. Devotees who dote on distinctive salads may find it hard to choose; the five offered here may cover green-market conventions -- Caesar, frisee, field greens and spinach -- but each is handled with finesse.
