We’ll get this out of the way first — Floyd has three alcohol-related arrests since 2009, something that is no doubt on the top of his file and something he was grilled about to no end during the combine process. Whether it costs him a few spots remains to be seen. But on the field, there are arguments to be made that Floyd is a better natural receiver than Blackmon. He has tremendous hands and the ability to make show-stopping catches anywhere on the field. Keep in mind, too, that he was double teamed at Notre Dame more often than not.

The 45-seat restaurant, also owned by Anthony Myint of Mission Street Food, has housed a taqueria and doughnut shop. The storefront windows are partly covered with an opaque film that shields the dining room from the street.

Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak offered that information early this afternoon to a group of reporters before the Cardinals' game with Cincinnati.

Across the aisle from me sat Kyle Kitagawa from Calgary, Canada, who brought his wife and two sons, ages 14 and 11. He retired at 42 in 2001 but still buys and sells companies in the oil industry, including a derelict one that he bought cheaply, revived and sold for $800 million. If he had that kind of money, I asked, why rush around the world? "You go some place for two weeks and if you don't like it, you're stuck," he said. "This trip is a sampler, like a buffet. You can always go back for seconds for the destinations you really like."
Meanwhile, the twins have fully recovered and are at home, the Quaids' lawyer tells People. "Their condition is fantastic, they're smiling. Zoe looks like her mom, and Boone looks like his dad.

Mr. Forssman, a gentle, humble man, knew how to connect every student to literature by getting us to dig deep into the text.

A combo guard with 3-point range, Galland runs the point for head coach Jim Redmon at Lewis and Clark. She scored a game-high 24 points – including 10 in the fourth quarter – as the Tigers defeated Federal Way High School, 62-49, in last season’s championship game.

The basics: Mid-century modern architecture in the United States is a direct descendant of the unadorned-modernist minimalism adapted from the German Bauhaus design tradition of the 1920s and early 1930s. It's no surprise, then, that immigrant architects Oscar and Hans Gerson Sr. chose upon their arrival in America to land in the Bay Area, where the updated style was flourishing.
"We weren't ready to play," Beavers coach Craig Robinson said. "The beginning of the game looked real good, and I don't know if it's the altitude, I don't if it's complacency, but a lot of it has to do with the fact that they played real good."

Although he arrived in San Francisco as Germany was surrendering to the Allies in April 1945, Mr. Hartman was in no mood for a victory celebration. His injuries remained so severe, he needed help disembarking.
The health care debate has been severely hampered by fear, myths, and by hyper-partisanship. The President clearly does not advocate socialism or a government takeover of health care.

Frankly, Oshie's hockey value was still open to interpretation as he began his fourth season. At times, he looked like a top-three forward. At other times, he looked like he might be best suited batting lower in the order. Case in point, Oshie spent a third period in Philadelphia sitting on the bench earlier this season, put in time-out by coach Davis Payne. Through 11 games, he had one goal and four assists, hardly top-tier stuff.

Whether this latest injury severely hurts OSU's defense depends a lot on what Banker's crew is able to work out along the line. After all, an inexperienced corner needs, above all else, a good defensive line in front of him.
She moved in just months after her building opened. Although it had ample communal space a kitchen, a community room, TV and computer rooms, sitting areas and a large patio most residents stayed in their rooms, she said.
I found the rough, rickety and rundown Leap-the-Dips at Lakemont Park to be the perfect throwback to the golden age of coasters, when thrills were raw and wild rather than neutered by lawyers and lawmakers. The 109-year-old ride crystalized everything I was searching for in my road trip across the coaster belt: history, tradition, rarity, excitement and fun.
"Honestly, I felt good," Halladay said. "I didn't execute pitches. It had nothing to do with anything else. I wish I had a better reason for you, but I don't. It was just a lack of executing pitches in key situations."

McCreery has criticized Brennan and O'Connell for repeatedly missing the annual Dec. 31 deadline for paying personal property taxes. Over the last 10 years, county records show Brennan paid late eight times and O'Connell seven times. McCreery, who was late twice herself, says her point is the "pattern and volume" involved.

Perhaps that is attributable to a good hockey team in a dire situation, trailing in the final period. Perhaps it is attributable, at least in part, to a fatigue factor.
Prince Harry recently announced plans to return to San Diego this summer. Except this time, his Southern California travel is dedicated to a charitable cause very close to his heart.
Coming out of the most religiously observant decade of American history, the 1950s, Putnam observed that we witnessed two seismic shocks in American public life. First, the social and political upheaval of the 1960s, during which time religious observance plummeted. Second, the social counterreaction to the 1960s that eventually coalesced in the Religious Right of the 1980s. (Although Putnam was adamant to note that this counterreaction began as a social and moral movement and not a political one.)

More precisely, umami is considered to be the fifth taste. It's a relatively new addition to the original four key sensory experiences related to taste: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. The direct Japanese translation does mean "delicious flavor" -- but the working definition conveys a more specific savory or meaty taste. Think briny oysters, woodsy mushrooms, vintage cheeses and rich hearty stocks. Umami is a distinct but subtle effect, blending well with other foods to enhance and deepen flavors.

On Monday, the Obama administration announced that insurance companies will have to provide birth control services to women with no co-pay. The new rules also eliminate the co-pay for other preventive health measures, such as prenatal care, counseling and equipment for breast-feeding, and screenings to detect HIV, gestational diabetes in pregnant women or signs of domestic violence.
I am also glad that my family and I are Democrats. After watching various Republican debates to earn extra credit in my "AP Government and Politics" class, I have come to the conclusion that the Republican candidates have the maturity level of elementary schoolchildren. That may seem like a harsh judgment coming from somebody who doesn't know a lot about politics, but that supports my case even more.
Diabetes damages health in a number of ways. People with diabetes are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease. Also, diabetes sufferers have a lower health-related quality of life. Diabetes is also related to an excess risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, the main form of liver cancer, and being overweight likely contributes to this.

Watching the dinner-speaker spectacle develop, then unravel, then redevelop (Will she or won't she speak/attend?) felt like watching a middle-school romance in which a friend tells another friend that so-and-so has a crush on you-know-who, but don't tell anybody. A little silly, in other words. And embarrassing. The "tick-tock" of what happened is a Byzantine exercise in blame-shifting. Briefly, someone in Palin's "organization" accepted the original invitation in March, whereupon the dinner hosts issued a press release announcing that Palin would be the keynote speaker.

Skylar Laine, "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me:" Ah, "Idol" theme weeks. Yes, this was a hit by the very British Dusty Springfield, but it's also originally an Italian song. You can hear its sheer Italian-ness in the flowing melody and the huge chorus. Jimmy and Little Steven both talk about the song needing to be moved to the country arena, which seems like a stretch. Even when Elvis sang it, it sounded Italian. Skylar doesn't do much with it, plus she's cursed with some of the dopiest staging in "Idol" history: She walks on stage past a couple silhouetted on a park bench. Is this "American Idol" or "The Lawrence Welk Show?" At the end, Skylar winds up shouting her way out of the song. Not one of her better performances, though the judges are more enthusiastic.
Although I had been using the term "rape" in conversation to describe the Penn State incident, I had not considered other language we rely on to describe sexual assault. Terms such as "had sex with" or "fondled" do sound awfully benign when you are talking about people being forced into acts against their will.

Many congregations this Sunday will hear Luke's account of the annunciation of Mary by Gabriel. The angel Gabriel addresses Mary as the recipient of God's favor, the chosen one of God-and invites her to discern her calling. Mary is perplexed by the announcement. "How can this be?" she wonders. "Nothing will be impossible with God," the messenger reminds Mary, standing before her as she continues to ponder her calling. It is a holy moment. As Presbyterian theologian Cynthia Rigby notes, "Mary's obedience is neither optional nor forced. Mary acts freely when she offers herself as a servant of the Lord." Because of an angel, Mary embraces her calling.
With Matthies retiring, the city is not interested in promoting from within. It is seeking an outsider with a canny eye toward promotional magic, in particular the use of social media to generate buzz.

Busch needs a minimum of 1,500 people to keep the place open seven days a week. They bulk the staff up to 4,500 for the peak summer and winter seasons between Christmas and Easter. But needs vary dramatically with weather, the day of the week, the time of day and attendance projections, so the park has made schedule juggling an art form.
The aggressiveness of these pictures (another one thrusts prosthetic butt cheeks erupting with pimples in the viewer's face) reflects Sherman's self-professed attempt to be less likable, less collectible. The gambit didn't seem to make a dent in her popularity, nor did a later set of images of creepy, threatening clowns or perversely reconfigured body parts from medical supply shops that make Hans Bellmer's erotic doll photographs look quaint in comparison.

The mayor should, at a minimum, be willing to tell us how decisions are being made. Are we relying on the same individuals who were unable to see the faults of the original Grand Prix business plan to evaluate plans for future events? Are any independent reviews or outside financial consultants (uninvolved in politics) being used to evaluate proposals before we commit our city's scarce resources to another event? For that matter, has anyone at City Hall been held responsible for the failure of the administration to see and forestall the financial disaster we now know the Labor Day event to be?

But "viewing" the "texts" of biographical movies put me in a quandary because my two very different sets of standards conflicted. I could hardly keep a straight face during the excesses and scenery chewing of "The Aviator," for instance, yet I found it far more enjoyable than the carefully and logically wrought "Kinsey." Yet "Kinsey" was the only movie — I meant to say text — from which I felt I learned anything worth knowing about its subject. The others amounted to varying degrees of escapism.

The Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve and underwater national park near the border with Belize is the Mexican Caribbean's ultimate dive site. The 24-mile-long, oval-shaped atoll has been protected since 1996, when the government caught wind of looters carrying away treasures from the many shipwrecks littering the reef.

The broadest step is a reduction of refinancing fees by the FHA on mortgages it backs. By significantly cutting the fees to refinance loans made before June 1, 2009, the typical borrower could save about $1,000 a year because of lower mortgage payments.

"One day my brother Randy started limping and he was in perfect health," said Carl Cadonau Jr., co-president of Alpenrose. "When he was diagnosed, we started to become involved right after that.

In Tustin, some $215 million of “must pay” redevelopment obligations were called into question – including loans between the city and its redevelopment agency (which are essentially the same thing), according to documents from the Department of Finance. Critics have said such loans were one way cities pulled money out of one pocket and put it into another, and it's something the department is on the prowl for. Tustin has submitted a revised list to the state, which is now being reviewed.
The university recovered the following year, landing former U.S. Atty. Gen Janet Reno for the 2001 commencement. But in 2002, the university trotted out Olympic gold-medalist skier Jonny Mosely (who at the time didn't have a bachelor's degree) to speak to graduating seniors, sparking popular rumors that UC Berkeley was campus non grata for anyone who had any hopes of seeking elected office. But UC Berkeley again came back with news anchor Ted Koppel and Jihad vs. McWorld author Benjamin Barber the next two years.

Thumping techno, a doorman at almost every pass, whimsical topiary animals, strategically placed sculptural chairs and experimental looped films greeted us as we made our way up to the open air rooftop bar, complete with an infinity pool and private waterbed pods.

Even though Smith says preserving the program is a high priority and rural voters are one of his core constituencies, no bill got out of committee to extend the payments until Democrats regained control of Congress.
Many European business leaders would second that notion, as demand evaporates in their home markets. The latest purchasing managers' index, an indicator of business activity from market-research firm Markit, showed Monday that the April figure for the euro zone's private sector contracted at its sharpest rate since November, suggesting the region's economic decline since last autumn might be steepening. And first-quarter earnings reports from European manufacturers—from car companies to electronics and energy giants— continue to show falling demand in Europe.

I do admire the manner in which Vanity Fair has enhanced Colacello's article with gorgeous photos that even I, an old-timer, have never seen before. The Duchess of Windsor, prominent, leaving La Cote Basque with the elegant C-Z Guest right behind her, ghostly gray and wearing a hat. These contrast with an urbane Truman Capote and his then pal Lee Radziwill, both wearing shades, exiting The Colony restaurant together.

The action is, admitted, pretty amazing. Star Iko Uwais is lithe and acrobatic, and the martial arts on display involve not only the usual karate chops to the carotid artery and high kicks to the head but more knives than you’ll see on a late-night infomercial. It’s all extremely loud, violent and intense.
The Centerfield Street area is where most people will start when arriving at the stadium, so you won't be surprised to know that it's home to the Trop's flagship bar, the Brewhouse.

On the other hand, the new 3-D "Titanic" does remind us that Cameron knows how to fill a screen. The movie (like "Avatar") loses a great deal on television, even on home theater systems. Cameron likes working on an epic scale that can best be appreciated in theaters, where his grand themes and "top of the world" gestures play better. The central love story involving steerage passenger Leonardo DiCaprio and rich girl Kate Winslet has lost none of its luster - metaphorically speaking.

Too often bipartisanship is equated with centrism or deal cutting. Bipartisanship is not the opposite of principle. One can be very conservative or very liberal and still have a bipartisan mindset. Such a mindset acknowledges that the other party is also patriotic and may have some good ideas. It acknowledges that national unity is important, and that aggressive partisanship deepens cynicism, sharpens political vendettas, and depletes the national reserve of good will that is critical to our survival in hard times. Certainly this was understood by President Reagan, who worked with Democrats frequently and showed flexibility that would be ridiculed today  from assenting to tax increases in the 1983 Social Security fix, to compromising on landmark tax reform legislation in 1986, to advancing arms control agreements in his second term.

Questions like these will be explored through presentations, close readings, conversation and creative exercises. Although not required, participants are encouraged to bring their own work, as well as favorite works by others.

Gout comes on when your body either makes too much or excretes (in your urine) too little uric acid — a byproduct of purine, a chemical that's in almost all human tissues and some foods.

If the shell presentation does not appeal to you, and if you plan to warm the lobster meat in gratin dishes, discard the heads. Twist off the claws as above. Hold each tail flat and twist away the fan-shaped pieces at the bottom narrow end. You can use your finger to push the tail meat out of the larger end. Or you can use sharp kitchen scissors to cut through the soft inner part of the shell (not the round part) to release the tail meat. Cut the tail meat in half lengthwise and then cut away the intestinal vein. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
By that measure, the signs are good.

Some of our leaders have decided that dismantling the American Dream is the answer to our economic troubles. They say we can no longer afford to let homeowners deduct from their taxes the mortgage interest they pay. Some say homeowners, instead of investing the proceeds from the sale of their home in a new home, should be forced to give part of their hard-earned profits to Uncle Sam. They even think we should end the policy of government support for programs that made home mortgages affordable to the average family. They say these programs, which have served our country well for generations, should be abandoned in the name of fiscal responsibility.
Santa Ana Unified officials say they hope to trim 131 teaching jobs through the combination of temporary teacher cuts and by offering early retirement incentives of up to $10,000 to other senior teachers.

May 16 will be the Outreach Programs Chief's Challenge Basketball and Skate Tournament from 10 at Trego Field in Perryville.
It makes me wonder if congregational hoarding keeps us from discovering the ministries God intends for us. Have our ministries have become so cluttered with programs that no longer work, ideas that are obsolete, and ways of being in touch with our community that do not meet real needs? Where do we need to change?
Janet Lister, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mom, heard her voice crack as she told the students how Ethan was diagnosed eight months earlier. She did not tell them about the mounting medical bills or how her husband was laid off from his plumber's job for three weeks. She did not say no mom should have to watch a son endure the side effects of chemotherapy -- vomiting, headaches, mouth sores. She did not tell the teens that she waits until she puts her three kids to bed before she sits on the couch some nights and sobs.

I want the team to do well, and if it’s not the spot that the coaches want me in, then that’s one thing. But the way I look at it is, there is a place that I can play and I don’t want anyone to take that away from me.”
"It seems like an overpowering building for what's being developed on Euclid," he said. "What's been developed on Euclid is two-, three-story buildings. And that thing is just a monstrosity.

Hey, Justin: I think their goal was to make the team young overnight, set in place a foundation of players and then let them grow and develop together. The idea was to grow and win, not to grow and lose.
A longtime faculty member of Oregon Health and Science University and past president of the Oregon Academy of Family Physicians, Goodwin brought mainstream credentials to his controversial advocacy of doctor-assisted suicide.

The Sporting News article goes on to detail how elite players at UF were rarely punished despite serious allegations. Among the most troubling of the incidents came in 2008 when star wide receiver Percy Harvin allegedly went unpunished after he physically assaulted Billy Gonzalez, who was then his position coach at UF. According to the story, Harvin ended up "grabbing (Gonzalez) by the neck and throwing him to the ground. Harvin had to be pulled off Gonzales by two assistant coaches-but was never disciplined."

The Brewers tapped around Garcia in the top of the sixth to not only tie the game but take the lead. Jonathan Lucroy had the most-damaging hit -- a two-out double off the left-field wall that scored two and broke a 1-1 tie. Garcia continues to carry the reputation of a young pitcher who can be undone by a hiccup. He has worked so far this season to control innings, to maintain poise, and there were times in each of his first couple starts this season that showed progress. The mistake on the bases that led to the mishaps on the mound were similar to starts he had last season with a play not made behind him or a call not given him at the plate would flick a domino run of trouble for the lefty.

The administration and many in Congress seem to view defense as an easy target for across-the-board reductions. Gates is waging his final war against such abstraction. Decisions on defense spending, in his view, must be based on strategy, not on budget mathematics. "Right now, the process is just the reverse," he argues. "Everybody's doing math and not strategy."

3Highball glass: If the drink requires a straw, it requires a tall glass. The highball (or the collins, which is narrower and doesn't hold as much liquid) can hold anything carbonated over ice, and is especially useful for drinks with muddled ingredients like mint and fruit. A pint glass is an OK substitute but the smaller surface of the highball does a better job concentrating the fizz of carbonated beverages and the aromas of garnish, like cucumber in your Pimm's Cup and celery in your Bloody Mary. A great, affordable pick is the Strauss Cooler ($3.95 at Crate & Barrel).

Chapters 4-6, composed by Harris, focus on "the human face" - the actual city street, be it cobbled or blacktopped; the century-old school house, its cavernous classrooms and stained-glass auditoriums still alight with lectures and laughter; the eclectic assortment of people who experienced life on the stoop and never forgot it.

She says air travelers have forgotten pre-9/11 airport security, which was run by the airlines and was porous and shoddy. Do we really want to return to that? "The airlines allowed 9/11 to happen," Schiavo says.

A jowly Branagh plays an overbearing Olivier, who is playing an overbearing prince of a fictional Balkan kingdom in "The Prince and the Showgirl" — strangely, he's better as the prince than as the legendary actor.

The Lyon B-25 was not on the raid – none of those planes came back and none were intended to, an important part of the story. Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle and 79 other fliers took off from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet knowing they didn't have fuel to make it back. These were lumbering, land-based bombers stripped of as much surplus weight as possible. Neither before nor since has anything like that been attempted.

Cons: The Knicks have been the worst team in the league since James joined the NBA. The media pressure would be perhaps the most intense of any athlete in history.

He long ago came full circle from the enforcer of a "law and order" administration to an advocate of mercy and restraint. He doesn't mind telling uncomfortable truths. He stirred up some of his fellow evangelicals when, in the 1990s, he promoted reconciliation with Catholics. He maddens the left with his unbending social conservatism.
I talked with Alex before he made his choice, then after. I congratulated him. He didn't let it eat him up. He also didn't go on TV and put on a hat from 10 or so sitting in front of him as so many others have done. Wish we had more kids like him.
