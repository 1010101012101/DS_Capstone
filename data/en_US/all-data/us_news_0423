The Flyers did not get a shot in the second period until 1:27 remained - when they had six men on the ice during a delayed penalty call. They finished the period with two shots.

In particular, we continue to believe that proposals such as floating the NAV, imposing onerous capital requirements or adding burdensome redemption restrictions will ultimately destroy the money market fund industry. In addition to the obvious impact on money market fund shareholders and sponsors, the demise of money market funds would remove important short-term financing capacity from the markets, inevitably resulting in less credit extension that would impact businesses large and small. Moreover, without money market funds as an investment option, we anticipate even more concentration of cash in banks, which would put even greater strain on an already overextended federal guarantee system.

Meanwhile, the Phillies blew several chances to escape with a win on Tuesday, but both Halladay and the bullpen imploded significantly. Halladay, who had been 107-0 coming in when his teams give him at least a four-run lead, was victimized by McCann's grand slam and his night was over after allowing the Braves to grab an 8-6 lead in the sixth inning.

His connection to Habitat has often prompted comparisons to Sir Terence Conran, who founded the homeware retailer and is famed for bringing modern design to the masses. And certainly Dixon is a democrat at heart. After all, this is a man who gave away 500 designer polystyrene chairs in Trafalgar Square six years ago. Known as the Great Chair Grab, it was sponsored by Expanded Polystyrene Packaging Group and floated the notion that furniture, like network television, was something you could give away by selling advertising.

In the summer of 1965, a Republican-run Ohio House, an evenly-split state Senate (with a Republican lieutenant governor to break any ties) and Republican Gov. James A. Rhodes wrote a 100-word House bill that signed Ohio up for Medicaid. The Senate vote was 29-0. The vote in the House (which then had more members than today's 99) was 122-3. Mr. Netzley was one of the three "no" votes.

As Colorado coach Tad Boyle points out, it's unusual for the 6-foot-7 Roberson to be matched against a forward who is just as athletic and 4 inches taller.

But he is capable of showing the potential of an NBA lottery pick — as he did in last week's Big 12 Tournament with 31 points against Kansas State and then outplaying Kansas' national player-of-the-year candidate Thomas Robinson. Roberson blocks a lot of shots, but in this case, he must do a better job of staying strong and blocking out Jones. That hasn't been Roberson's strength.
* Nikki Bella won the Divas Championship, ending Beth Phoenix's reign mere days before it set a record for length, in a Lumberjill match. Phoenix appeared that she may have legitimately hurt her ankle, or she did a superb job of selling. Hopefully this sets up for something, such as the return of Kharma, who was mocked by the Bellas on her way out the door, and isn't just a way to stop Phoenix from breaking Maryse's record. As for the match itself, it wasn't bad and was actually given more time than most divas matches.

All his films get good reviews. His latest, "The Descendants," is getting great ones.

"What do you think?" I asked proudly.
At that time, bassist Kool and his brother Ronald, a saxophonist, wanted to play jazz — and their 1969 debut anticipates many of the innovations of fusion. But by the beginning of the next decade, Kool and the Gang were the hardest of the deep funk bands, journeying so far into rhythm and syncopation that their tightness astonished even James Brown. The Godfather of Soul cautioned against playing Kool and the Gang in the car; he feared the band’s joyful ferocity would compel listeners to drive straight off the road.
Diners can get a beautifully crisped baby chicken next to a lemon-dressed pile of wild arugula ($18), or a hearty bowl of pork cheek stew ($15) in a rich broth with fresh peas, carrots, a scattering of fresh herbs and a knob of just-mashed Yukon gold potatoes ($15).

The winner's art also will appear on a limited edition of Crayola's 64 crayon box. The other four national finalists each will win a $5,000 college scholarship.
Big smirk there. Political correctness isn't Watson's nature. His thought pattern can be unfiltered – the words flowing in quick bursts, always with the possibility of a side trip. He might touch on his Christian faith. Or pan sports psychologists. Or in Tuesday's case, riffing on the new parent's diaper dilemma.

These were serious leaders for serious times. They were great politicians, but they didn't spend all their time playing games or scoring points.

In Olympia, roughly 500 people packed the Red Lion Hotel's basement conference room. The crowd exceeded the expectations of caucus organizers, as evidenced by a shortage of chairs at the site.
When we meet Matt, it is in the midst of crises. His wife's recent boating accident has put her in a coma and him, at least temporarily, in charge of the kids. Handling a precocious and prickly 10-year-old, Scottie (Amara Miller), and the outright rebellion of 17-year-old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) is no easy matter even in the best of times. And for the King family, this is pretty much the worst of times.

In May, an instructor was so worried about physical violence on Mr. Loughner's part that she requested—and received—a police guard outside her class. By June, a dean told the police that students in Mr. Loughner's math class were "afraid of any repercussions that could exist from Loughner being unstable in his actions."
In deciding whether the bill advances a religious agenda, the governor needs to look at context and history as well as the text. A useful reference work would be a 2005 decision by a federal judge in Pennsylvania striking down a school board policy requiring that students be made aware of "gaps/problems in Darwin's theory and of other theories of evolution including, but not limited to, intelligent design." In that case, Judge John E. Jones concluded that intelligent design and teaching about "gaps" and "problems" in evolutionary theory are "creationist, religious strategies that evolved from earlier forms of creationism."

Though she told the magazine that she is “beyond obsessed” with refining her appearance, she takes issue with People’s assertion that she’s “addicted to plastic surgery.”

To continue our discussion from yesterday, I have to think that Casey's reaction is almost never "It's OK guys, that one doesn't count anyway." After winning back to back titles in 2006 and 2007, Casey's expectations for his program year in and year out are different, and higher, than a lot of others in the Oregon State athletic program. And rightfully so -- the Beavers broke into the upper echelon of college baseball with those titles, proving the first one was not a fluke. Their program has experienced tremendous success, and with that comes vaulted expectations.

That is, if you set aside the so-called "jukebox musicals." Shows built around established hits, from the Four Seasons revue "Jersey Boys" to the hair-metal goof "Rock of Ages," are ubiquitous.

“The problem is there are just too many standards for teachers to deal with, and they don’t have time to teach all of them to give the kids the understanding they need,” Habermehl said. “If it’s not fun, and they’re just doing homework that’s not fun, then they lose interest.

The only run of the game came in the fourth, when Ryan Sweeney looped a broken-bat double for the first hit off Peavy. Sweeney later scored on a single by Adrian Gonzalez.

Such team-ups have been relatively common in comic books, where DC heroes often worked together, including in the Justice League of America, and Marvel has had not only the Avengers - who premiered as a somewhat different unit in 1963 - and the Defenders.

Each man brought a unique area of expertise, but even the oversized Amazon "seemed unable to accommodate all of these explorers' egos and ambitions."

Sweeney also told reporters today that the governor’s “tool kit” of measures aimed at reducing property taxes won’t lower the levies. He said Christie’s moves to cut $820 million in school aid and $445 million in funding for municipalities drove up the levies beyond any savings in the package.
