"No, you can't do that," Hitchcock said. "He's a top-six forward, so if he's going to play, he's going to play. ... If he gives us the OK, there's no working him back in. You're in, you play. No different than (Sidney) Crosby or any of these other guys. No such thing ... We're going to deal with him like he's a current player and he's just coming off training camp and go from there."

Recent law school graduates are known to labor over the high-stakes bar exam.
It's a real wrenching thing to go from being a private person to being a public person, especially when you're being autobiographical. But it's what everyone wants—to get everyone's attention, to have your music make a living for you, to be validated in that way. So I'm a little embarrassed that I complained about getting what I wanted so badly. I know there are people who don't like their audience or like the experience of being recognized or celebrated, but my audience has been very good—they don't bother me and when they do contact me it's usually on the nicest possible terms.
"We have to go back to L.A. and win that game," Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph said. "That's what it is ... We have to get our rest tonight and tomorrow and be ready Friday."
"Shame on Barack Obama for diminishing the memory of Sept. 11 and the killing of Osama bin Laden by turning it into a cheap political attack ad," Sen. John McCain said in a statement issued by the Republican National Committee. "This is the same president who said, after Bin Laden was dead, that we shouldn't 'spike the ball' after the touchdown. And now Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end-zone dance to help himself get reelected."

“We just continue to improve,” Zorn said. “That has probably been the difference is that our guys are playing better, we are executing much better. We are hanging together as a football team and I think that has made a huge difference for us. Even though we have lost some close games, we haven’t just given up and I think that is a testament to our players, our coaches for continuing to kind of get back in line and try again and to see if our next plan is to see if we can finish it.”
The latest indication that women's rights could be eroding came when the 150-member Council of Religious Scholars recently issued a "code of conduct" for women that, among other things, calls for segregation of the sexes in the workplace and in education and prohibits women from traveling unless accompanied by a close male relative.

The governor has already said he figures to be among the most unpopular politicians in Ohio this year and next because of the tight budget. Not to worry, he anticipated as much. In fact, he again on Tuesday did his fair share of seeding thoughts of just how dismal things were as he took office. But then he quickly noted that he has a plan.

"Psycho" (1960): More potential spoilers, if there's actually anyone who hasn't seen, or at least heard about, Alfred Hitchcock's great shocker. Anthony Perkins operates the Bates Motel and answers to his mother; let's just say Janet Leigh isn't the only who looks good in a dress.

Kaptur launched an attack ad last month that accused Kucinich of voting against funding for new manufacturing jobs and veterans care and a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens.

Like the "Twilight" series, and many of the "Harry Potter" pictures, this is a dutiful adaptation of an imaginative, evocative page-turner; it renders the most vivid passages of Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel -- for instance, the attack of the "tracker jackets," a group of deadly wasps -- exactly as you might picture the scenes while reading them. Yet Ross (who previously directed "Seabiscuit") serves up images that feel recycled from familiar pop ephemera like "Logan's Run," "The Fifth Element," or David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust phase; and the screenplay (which Ross co-wrote with Collins and Billy Ray) ultimately pulls too many punches, softening the novel's core of bitterness and nihilism. The result is well-made and absorbing, but never especially exciting -- a movie that ends up denying the potential of its source material.

2008 Grooner Gr�ner Veltliner, Austria ($9-$11) - Gr�ner Veltliner wines were the buzz awhile ago, and it's easy to understand why as they're fun to taste. But I'd found mixed results in how enjoyable they actually were. This wine is super good. It's bright, balanced, round and crisp and kicks the tail feathers off most of the Sauvignon blancs around. 89 points

"I think the entire enterprise was mismanaged from the get-go, and one reason I voted for George W. Bush the first time was because in the debates he said he was not going to engage in nation building. And they got into a nine-year episode of nation building in Iraq. I suspect the world is better off without Saddam Hussein ... but it's been at a terrible price, obviously. I doubt that many of the American people or the Iraqis fully appreciate the price that's been paid. People screamed it was all about oil. We left them better than we found them, but I'm not counting on any measure of gratitude or thanks. The present administration bungled it, too. They walked out without any oil concessions, any agreements. They just essentially walked out on the deal, too. I'm not happy with either bunch."
"There's not one thing we do great but lots of things we do well," VonFeldt said. "Tony Orlando and Alex Bolte have done great for us defensively, and our middles -- Ryan Jepperson and Ryan Lawson -- have really come through for us. It's allowed us to spread our offense out."
If and when it happens, free agency could be another way to strengthen the roster. The Bears landed the bell cow last season in defensive end Julius Peppers. Angelo doesn't know what next year's salary cap will be, making it difficult to predict how active he will be in free agency. That said, he expects to be active, although signing another expensive free agent may be unrealistic.
"We created a solution for ourselves after what we considered was the financial crisis. Then, more was taken away," said Debbie Baer, president of the West Windsor-Plainsboro Education Association.

I got lots of double-takes, sitting in my hospital gown in the waiting room with a cake perched on my lap. Yet I quickly discovered that baking wasn't an escape for me alone. Because they're associated with happy occasions, seeing cakes in such an incongruous setting seemed to transport my fellow oncology patients back in time to childhood kitchens and carefree days before cancer hijacked their lives.

Hollande is a diplomatic unknown who will set a five-year course for his nuclear-armed country with a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. Sarkozy is arguably the most America-friendly French leader in a half-century. He has aligned with Washington on Iran and Syria, upped France's military presence in Afghanistan and took a major role in NATO's air campaign over Libya that helped oust dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Hollande wants to bring French troops home from Afghanistan early and might be less vigorous in flexing military or diplomatic muscle abroad.

"It's not surprising that Republicans in Ohio are confused as to why Sherrod would stay in D.C. and do his job instead of attending a political rally," said Justin Barasky, an Ohio Democratic Party spokesman.

"Listen, don't give me that (bleep) about it's the new and the old (NHL players) because whether you think that people notice or not, you're wrong.

That's what happened in that game. The fans went there anticipating that somebody was going to step up.

David Whitley, FanHouse: "Baseball would have been integrated without Jackie Robinson, but the process still needed a trailblazer worthy of the role. Similarly, women's basketball would have exploded without Summitt being hired in 1974. What she did was epitomize the evolution. Imagine a 22-year-old becoming head coach now at a school like Tennessee, and making $8,900 a year.

They weren't allowed to cross mid-court, since such full-court exertion was deemed too strenuous for girls. Summitt, a six-on-six veteran, knew better. With Title IX kicking in, the rest of the world eventually caught up. But it wasn't until 1982 that the NCAA sanctioned the sport for women. Summitt built the model every program aspired to be but few have matched."

Britain's smooth adjustment to being surpassed by the United States in the early 20th century is one case that gained China's attention. Another, and very different, example is Germany's bid to challenge France's position in Europe and Britain's supremacy at sea in the late 19th century. That latter gambit evoked an alliance among Britain, France and Russia, led to Germany's encirclement and eventually to a world war that brought disaster to Europe and defeat to Germany. It need not have been that way. Otto von Bismarck, who unified Germany after Prussia's defeat of Austria (1866) and France (1871), understood the importance of treading lightly and assuaging the fears of Germany's neighbors so that they would not join forces and encircle it. Once Kaiser Wilhelm dismissed Bismarck in 1890, he discarded the Iron Chancellor's strategy and embarked on what proved to be the ruinous path to 1914.
