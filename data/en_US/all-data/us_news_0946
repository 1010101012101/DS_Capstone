In the first half of this satire from writers Kirk Pynchon and Mike Beyer, you'll find one of the funniest skewerings of Hollywood vs. Chicago — specifically, Hollywood vs. our town's noble-but-unglamorous storefront theater scene. Though I cannot endorse Act 2, when the play loses the strength of its comedic convictions, all that comes before it is a must-see for anyone with an affection for Chicago's off-Loop theater companies.
Similarly, the court in 2000 struck down a provision in U.S. law letting victims of gender-based violence sue in federal court, rejecting government contentions that the measure had a sufficient connection to interstate commerce.
His menu favors the spice-laden specialties of the Ahandra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu regions on the southeastern side of the subcontinent: Coconut milk (substituting for dairy milk), fresh pungent curry leaves and a healthy helping of chile distinguish many curries. Yet every dish that emerges from this kitchen displays a distinct flavor profile that shines through the heat. Chicken, lamb and seafood are the mainstays, and in accordance with custom throughout southern India, beef or pork aren't served.

On the other hand, the chef can get eccentric about richness on the plate. He smartly matches caramelized chicken livers with kale and mustard sauce ($12), but underseasons the meat, giving it a flatness. He pairs a semitrimmed veal breast ($20) with a creamy polenta and oil-based salsa cruda. Every element by itself was a plush pleasure. Teamed up, they exposed too many fat-based layers.

From a security standpoint, violent organized crime, which has devastated the region and brought tragic insecurity, must be addressed as a necessary precursor to economic prosperity and stable democratic institutions.

Several companies did warn that their cargo needed more space. Feel for them. Thompson Metal Fab President John Rudi told a reporter for The Columbian that his company "had notified CRC as far back as 2006 that we were looking for at least a 125-foot clearance." But given the landscape, with a new bridge having to accommodate both river traffic and air travel nearby while assisting a whole lot of commuters, it is debatable whether the bridge can or should have to accommodate a few companies' large river loads or future large loads.

Quite the opposite of their Keystone State mates -- those Philadelphia Phillies -- the Pittsburgh Pirates cannot solve Pujols. He'll be leading off the next inning for the Cardinals as I type this, and he's already 2-for-2 with a home run in the first inning, a single in the fourth inning and two runs scored. In his career, he's had almost an entire season against the Pirates and what a season before Wednesday night:

-- The 3-4 defense and the savvy guys behind it: If Steelers' defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau didn't invent the zone blitz, he perfected it and made it into what it is today as a strategy of choice. Packers defensive coordinator Dom Capers is right there with LeBeau as a master of the 3-4 and zone blitz.
While he did not name the countries, his use of the term "certain" indicated he was talking about the United States, Britain and France. Iran has been careful not to irk Russia and China, the other two nuclear-weapons states that have signed the Nonproliferation Treaty and which oppose sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic by Washington and its Western allies.
Given Beckham’s pedigree and fielding skills, he could appeal to a lot of teams looking either to shake things up or fill a long-term need at second base. It’s a position of interest in the AL Central, with the Tigers, Twins and Royals seemingly in flux, but even a team like Tampa Bay could take a shot (they’ve tried five second basemen already, who have hit a combined .176).

The first hit off this album, "Teenage Daughters," co-written with the Warren Brothers, Brett and Brad, taps into her own life as the mother of three daughters age 16, 13 and 6. It may be the biggest -- and happiest -- surprise. The Warrens are two of Nashville's best and most prolific singer-songwriters.

Lohan had already done one 30-day stint in rehab and had been clearly been struggling even before her May 2007 arrest.

This brings us to the focus of the night: The Del Mar Mud Run. Bravo is getting pretty heavy-handed in their staging. We know that the events the ladies attend are legit, but the guest list isn’t always as genuine. This week, amid disintegrating friendships, the women are literally crawling through mud and the charity for which they are supposedly running is never disclosed. Obvious much?
I actually like football a great deal. I am not some anti-sports prude. It has a place in our society, but not on college campuses. If you want to establish a minor league system that the National Football League pays for—which they should, given that they are the greatest beneficiaries of college football—that is fine.
In San Jose, for example, employee pay and benefits continue to outpace revenues. The city's employee pension bill has ballooned from $73 million to $245 million in a decade.

"Stomp" was a radical record for its time. The bass line is pure ’90s soul, and Franklin handed over the bridge of the song to rapper Salt of Salt-N-Pepa. As the God’s Property choir sang gleefully, Franklin testified with the fervency of a penitent and the fury of an emcee. "Stomp" became a huge hit on R&B radio as well as the gospel charts.
To this day, homeopaths put forth mystical-sounding explanations involving "vital force" and "healing energy." And with arcane ingredients like "nux vomica" and "arsenicum album," many homeopathic medicines sound like something brewed in a druid's kettle.

The pull. Now comes the most critical part - when to pull it off the grill. About a half hour or so after the turn, you'll see Jerry periodically grabbing at the tri-tips with his gloved hand like he's checking loaves of bread for freshness. Color is not a good indicator. Top 'cuers go strictly by feel. It should feel as firm as a lightly flexed muscle. Here's Boop's method of gauging: Touch the tip of your left thumb to the tip of your left index finger, creating an "O." Now take your right thumb and index finger and pinch the muscle that's between the base of your left thumb and the base of your left index finger. A tri-tip with that firmness will be rare. Now touch the tip of your left thumb to the tip of your left pinkie. (If you can't do this without assistance, you've had too many Bud longnecks.) Now squeeze your hand muscle at the same place. See how it's firmer? This would be the firmness of a well-done piece. Of course, we all have different musculature, but you get the idea. With practice, you can figure out when the meet is done strictly by feel. Strive for this.
And children younger than 10 should not be treated with cholesterol drugs unless they have severe cholesterol problems, the guidelines say.
Rockhurst defeated the Wildcats on April 22 by a 10-6 count. But Eureka's Ryan Gardner, who had a hat trick for the Wildcats in Saturday's game, said that was a different Eureka team back then.
Rolling Stone heard Smashing Pumpkins, but I can't help thinking that guitar sound puts it closer to My Bloody Valentine, which may just mean it's somewhere in the middle. Not the worst location for a record. And this one is blessed with a bittersweet vocal hook ("We chew it together") destined to become the line you find repeating on a tape loop in your head. It also has a really cool distorted bassline.

‘‘The one thing about this team that maybe we haven't had in other years that we've had success is this team really came together. I don't see this team as a team of great talent. I see this as a team that played well together and really responded to the adversity that every team goes through.''
That's what Florida, and then Nevada, Michigan, Arizona and perhaps other states on the calendar will tell us. But there is no doubt that the defeat here Saturday represents a setback to Romney. He has won just one of three opening contests in the GOP race after it looked like he was positioned to start the year 3-0.

"If you look at the men, 90 percent of the top runners come out of Kenya and Ethiopia," Hartnett said. "The women have mixed it up. It's more of a worldwide event. You've got the Russian women (placing high), Chinese women, Japanese women. It's more broadly cast."
CLEVELAND -- Browns general manager Tom Heckert said today that he expects Brandon Weeden to be installed as the Browns starting quarterback right away.
If that sounds familiar, it’s because that’s all out of Aldridge’s playbook. And that’s one thing that makes Hickson’s future so interesting. He and Aldridge essentially play the same position, power forward. Certainly, both have played center – Hickson quite a bit when he was with Cleveland – but both seemed best suited to play the four.
When the season opens, there is already a rift between you and your husband and Teresa and Joe. But I was reading in Teresa’s new cookbook that you all spend a lot of time together, seeing each other several days a week. Is she whitewashing it for the book?

Hey, Tom: I've been watching Kentucky's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist closely this season and he looks like an amazing player. He has a great work ethic, unstoppable motor, and is a great kid. He also played with Kyrie in high school, and is athletic. On most draft boards I looked at lately, Kidd-Gilchrist has been around 7-11. If the Cavs keep the pace they're doing now, they will probably get around a 5-9 pick. Have the Cavs looked at him? -- Vinny Horvath, Euclid

Jason Bourne's gone, but the shadowy program that created him lives on. As might this remarkably solid action franchise, inspired by the clandestine world created by Robert Ludlum. This time, Jeremy Renner, who recently cut his block-buster action teeth in "Mission Impossible — Ghost Protocol," is the agent with an even more lethal skill set and, it seems, none of predecessor Bourne's ambivalence.

I think the term "bounty" has become a catch-all cliche. I think part of the problem is verbiage. A "bounty" wouldn't describe the process of players slipping cash to each other for making INTs, causing fumbles, or making a key stop on third down.

In fact, the madness began more than four weeks before the big day as giant over-sized signs sullied the normally bucolic Geauga landscape. So much so, that some people told me they hoped for a good old-fashioned snowstorm to bury those political signs. But, it wasn’t in the tea leaves. Not even two significant wind storms could restore the land to its semi-rural character.
The other day, a friend asked me to tell him honestly - as a normal human being - what my favorite cocktail is. I thought about a drink with ingredients that don't require a visit to an expensive gourmet shop, an act of Congress to import or the hiring of a detective to track down.

Researchers are still investigating the best way to treat teens with bulimia. Evidence is mounting in favor of cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves helping individuals change their attitudes and thoughts about food and body image. Studies show that about 40% of people with bulimia will recover after three to six months and another 40% will improve but still struggle with the disease; 20% remain the same or get worse, according to a 2010 review in the journal Minerva Psychiatry.

The family's lawsuit alleged school officials knew or should have known the boy's attacker had violent tendencies and failed to comply with a state anti-bullying law, said the Rosensteins' attorney, Jeffrey Youngman. The boy had punched another student in the face on a school bus a year earlier, but the school kept no record of it or other attacks and the attacker was not subjected to escalating discipline, the suit said.
This argument is not only a destructive one, it didn't need to happen. For almost 100 years, ever since the debt ceiling was first put in place during World War I, it has always been raised when necessary, as Congresses of both parties realized that the country's credit rating shouldn't be a political football.
Eustachy has not finalized his coaching staff but plans on hiring Leonard Perry and Ross Hodge as assistants and Tiffany Beckham as the director of basketball operations.

London's East End is synonymous with many things, and, until recently, few of them were good.
This has been one of the toughest years for public workers that I can remember. Every month until this past one, the private sector has added jobs, and every month, the public sector has lost them. The August employment report shows that the public sector got hit hard again -- losing 17,000 jobs. In states across the country, public workers aren't just being laid off; they're being made into economic scapegoats. These workers deserve to be treated fairly any time. But in the wake of Hurricane Irene, as we watched teams of federal, state and local government workers tirelessly saving lives, and on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, they deserve much better.
The presidential election is less than a year away, which means President Barack Obama will almost certainly face voters with the highest unemployment rate of any president since World War II.

The Kauffman study acknowledges the growth in one-person firms, but it says the current crop of self-employed people "are not likely to employ others or to reach significant scale."
I have a fairly healthy dislike for both teams, but Seattle is worse by far. I've only been supporting the Timbers for seven years but I've been a huge sports fan my whole life, and the Sounders are already firmly entrenched in the top two or three on my hate list.

"We've all been patiently waiting to see exactly what the vehicle is going to look like," said Peter Cheney, a 63-year-old potential space tourist from Seattle who was among the first to sign up for suborbital space rides marketed by Virgin Galactic. "It would be nice to see it in the flesh."
1. Stop paying for extras. This seems such a commonsensical prescription for a city in crisis that you wonder why Detroit didn't eliminate frills (like landscaping) and redundant bureaucracies (like the city health department, whose services largely duplicate those provided by Wayne County) long ago.

Mitch Wolgamott, DEQ's division administrator in eastern Oregon, tells me that's a small pond as these sewage lagoons in the outback go. When the ponds are properly maintained, sunlight and the wind work their will on the wastewater, and it "may be decades," Wolgamott said, before you need to remove the sludge.
Most pundits expect that to be the norm over the final 20 games of the season. But when asked following Wednesday's practice what makes him believe performances like Tuesday night -- when the Blazers lost to the Bucks 116-87 -- will not be the norm, Aldridge said he wouldn't allow it.
They had reason to be nervous. The area that incorporated as Maryland Heights in 1985 contained a sizable chunk of St. Louis County's tax revenue. Gene McNary, then the county executive, was not about to let it go without a fight.
Several nutritional supplements purport to help men take a big step closer to fatherhood. FertilAid for Men, manufactured by Fairhaven Health, contains megadoses of antioxidant vitamins and B vitamins. Take three capsules a day as directed and you'll be getting almost seven times your recommended dietary allowance of vitamin E, more than 10 times your RDA for vitamin B12 and almost three times your RDA for vitamin C. The product also contains large doses of minerals such as zinc, selenium and chromium. It's topped off with a blend that includes the amino acid L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10, two nutrients that, according to some theories, may help boost the swimming power of sperm.

And there's chatter about 'The Help.'
The state needs to right its finances by the close of the fiscal year that ends in June, when it is required by law to have a balanced budget, unlike the federal government. Every week that passes leaves less wiggle room, fewer places to trim and more bills that have already been paid.

Finally, please stop using that old, failed, and yet-to-be-realized "Dodge City scenario" where everyone is gunning down everyone else. In spite of all of your hopes and desires for that to be true, it simply does not happen. John R. Lott Jr. addressed that in great, unchallengeable detail, and proved the antithesis of your argument. When the people are allowed to carry guns, crime declines — not in some cases, but in every case.

The big downside to the phone is its network. T-Mobile only offers two flavors of HSPA+, which is far slower than speeds on fast LTE networks like Verizon or AT&T. In downtown Washington, D.C., my average download speed with the T-Mobile One S was just over 3 megabits per second, and upload speeds were about 1 megabit per second. When I tested the phone's speeds on a trip to Boston, the results were even slower.

How valued is the player's position in the scheme? Is there a player at the position lower in the draft who's not much different in talent, who would thus be a better value?

The players also have distinguishing characteristics. As Umenyiora put it, Tuck is a “technician,” Kiwanuka is “rangy,” Tollefson “works very hard,” Pierre-Paul’s athleticism makes him “the most talented defensive end I’ve seen in a long time,” and Umenyiora is a self-described “technically-sound speed rusher” with a power move that’s surprised many an offensive tackle, the latest of which was the Dolphins’ Jake Long.

Our nation's track record is indisputable: When the United States wants to lead, we make a national commitment and invest the necessary resources. Since World War II, few policies have enjoyed as much bipartisan support as research and development. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Manhattan Project created the nuclear power industry; Presidents Dwight Eisenhower's and John Kennedy's post-Sputnik programs sparked the information technology and aerospace revolution; and Reagan's investments in defense technology helped win the Cold War.

To go with those non-sodas? Sweet-potato chips, kale chips, bean chips, banana chips — anything-but-corn chips, in fact, as corn becomes a new devil of the health food world. Consumers want traditional foods like chips and crackers to snack on at home but would like to feel less guilty about eating them, says Heather Smith, a spokeswoman for New Hope Natural Media.

Spotlight performances by the members of the Miles High Big Band were equally impressive. Guitarist Jon Herington tore through a lengthy lead on "Reelin’ in the Years"; trombonist Jim Pugh added marching-band swagger to "Night By Night." The solos were grounded in bedrock provided by a superb rhythm section: bassist Freddie Washington and drummer Keith Carlock. Midway through the show, the band locked into an unshakable groove on a trio of songs from "Ecstasy" (indeed, Steely Dan played most of their sophomore album, including the infrequently aired "Pearl of the Quarter") — "Show Biz Kids," "Boston Rag," and "Bodhisattva."

Lena Hart is terrific as Curley's wife. Costume designer Allison Connor has her dolled up in a dress that is something like what I've seen in old pictures of my aunts, and she struts and flirts with a sad exuberance. It's not that much fun being Curley's wife, for a town girl who wants to be a star in Hollywood.

It's typical for new administrations to replace agency directors and top officials with close ties to a previous governor. But Burke came with a largely a-political pedigree compared to Dolan, a former Cleveland City Councilman and active Democrat. Burke, a former partner at the Cleveland law firm Jones Day, clashed with Ohio Auditor Mary Taylor over Taylor's decision in 2009 to launch a performance audit of the $2.4 billion agency that showed no signs of trouble. The audit largely praised the lottery's operations. Taylor later became Kasich's running mate.
He will enter uncertain territory this summer, both in terms of his potential as a player and a wage earner.

2. So the change to a new manager could be a tricky issue in this regard: the new manager would be mistaken if he thinks he'll just come in and simply leave all pitching-related matters in Duncan's hands. It shouldn't work that way. La Russa never did it. And the new manager can't do it, either. No pitching coach, not even Duncan, has 100 percent autonomy. And to be honest, it would be a complete cop-out for a new manager to shirk responsibility for an important part of the team. Seriously, why would you even hire a guy who declares (for example), "I don't have to worry about the pitching. That's all on Duncan. I'll leave him alone and just concentrate on everything else." Oh, really? So Duncan is in charge of roughly half the team, and the new skipper is in charge of the other half? No way. If that's the case, then the Cardinals should just name co-managers -- Duncan and the new guy. Because even though Duncan has made a remarkably successful impact on the St. Louis Cardinals, he isn't the manager. The manager is in charge of all 25 players and coaches. He must be the leader for all 25 players and coaches. Not just the position players. If any of the six managerial candidates think they'll just come in and supervise the position players, they may want to rethink that. And they may want to call GM John Mozeliak and clarify their views.

No budget is perfect, but let not the perfect be the enemy of the good. The "doomsday" budget is that rarest of all occurrences in government: compromise. It increases spending by $600 million more than Republicans wanted, reduces Governor O'Malley's budget by $600 million; and spares working families from yet another round of tax increases, while adequately funding core government services.
WASHINGTON - The Rangers grinded through their postseason house of horrors Wednesday night and emerged bleeding, limping and victorious from the Verizon Center.

Stillman hasn't expanded his purview much, or pushed himself to explore new issues and themes: His characters still talk in complete sentences, declaiming and deadpanning, making their case with misguided passion and no little irony.

The pick of these digital albums is titled “Passion and Pain,” a set of dramatic, richly emotional works. Gilbert and company’s way with Haydn’s “La Passione” Symphony is dark-hued and muscular yet lightened by silvery harpsichord continuo. Schubert’s “Unfinished” Symphony isn’t as boldly etched as it might be, but Berg’s Three Orchestral Pieces sound as fantastical as ever. And John Adams’ 1988 setting of Walt Whitman’s gritty Civil War-era poem “The Wound Dresser” has never sounded more affecting, with Hampson’s tone and diction ideal.
And while the success of fringe parties in Greece may be more of a case of rejecting the fiscal straightjacket its citizens feel trapped in, its election results are a reminder that severe budget cuts, unemployment and hopelessness can give rise to extremists.

Note on adding color: Macarons taste delicious whether colored or not. In order to minimize moisture content, Tian uses powdered food coloring, which may be found at craft or specialty-food stores or ordered from online sources such as amazon.com or chefrubber.com. Because the strength of the food coloring varies depending on the brand, you may have to experiment. For making yellow shells for the Meyer Lemon Curd Filling, Tian recommends using 1/8 teaspoon yellow powdered food coloring; for rose macaron shells, she suggests 3/8 teaspoon red and 1/16 teaspoon blue powdered food coloring. Coloring is a matter of personal preference. Use more or less as desired; and expect the white meringue to dilute the color considerably. I made lovely rose macarons with only red coloring. If you can't find powdered food coloring, try gels, which contain less water than traditional food coloring.

A: I'm just grateful that I have some time in my life where the films that I'm making are in some way not excluded from the zeitgeist. Many directors can do honest work their entire lives, and it's almost like a comet entering an orbit or something; it never quite enters the zeitgeist. And then successful directors have a time, often it's been said around 10 years, where the films that they're making are somehow within the zeitgeist. They can float out before and after. Think of Robert Altman. ... You just kind of keep working.

Young apologized for his actions and the subsequent embarrassment evoked. He assumed all responsibility. He announced hes going through a Major League Baseball-sponsored outpatient alcohol treatment program.

But what he really wants is the solution to a mystery. His grandniece Harriet disappeared 40 years before, and Vanger is convinced that someone in the family had something to do with it. This haunts him, and he wants Blomkvist's help in finding out what really happened, with the promise of good money and revenge against Wennerstrom. Before offering Blomkvist the job, Vanger had the writer's background checked -- by Lisbeth, an expert hacker whose methods sometimes fall on the far side of legal.

"It's very telling," Johnson said. "In a situation like Hood River County, we're talking perennials -- orchards. For the acreage to increase, that's quite an investment. That says there's a good enough stability there that the farmer is willing to invest back in the land and increase acreage."

Another bit of procedural news: The law's more than 700 pages of individual directives have already spawned 2,163,744 words (Fox News describes the volume as 21/2 times the size of the Bible) of regulatory interpretation (as of May) from federal agencies, mostly the Department of Health and Human Services. In other words, Obamacare is bureaucratic heaven on Earth; its regulations will be issued (and become the subject of countless lawsuits) for decades to come. This, of course, is one of the primary attractions for Obamacare's advocates, as federal health care policy gradually becomes more a function of government dictate than market-generated demand.

Though it may not be true in all cases, perhaps there is more to perceive in underachieving students than indifference and laziness.
