False. It doesn't matter how you remove the stinger, pluck or scrape. What's important is doing it as quickly as possible. Scientists at the University of California Riverside proved this by inflicting multiple bee stings on their own forearms and measuring the size of the resulting welts after scraping or pinching the stingers off. Pinching stingers didn't force out more venom. Every second of delay, however, produced a significantly bigger welt. Call 911 if a sting triggers breathing difficulties, itching, or swelling beyond the site of the sting -- signs of an allergic reaction that can rapidly progress to anaphylactic shock and death. Non-allergic people may need medical care after a mass stinging by a swarm of bees or wasps. The amount of injected venom can reach overwhelmingly toxic levels. Symptoms of a severe toxic reaction may take 24 hours to develop.

There are, of course, other ways to remove Ohio public officials. One is impeachment, but that moves more slowly than a (pre-global-warming) glacier. Then there's the General Assembly's power to remove judges through a procedure -- perhaps never used -- requiring a two-thirds vote of each legislative house.

Last decade, voters took that route to remove certain school board members in Madison (2005) and Lawrence (2006) counties.

This project has been in making for almost four years and many leaders of other faiths in New York were in favor of it. One of the main goal for this endeavor was to build bridges among the communities of New York. It was never meant to be "Victory Mosque" or to hurt any one's feelings. If the project was to make a point, the Imam and his team would have been announcing it to get attention.The discussion has changed from " how is this possible that a mosque is being built at Ground Zero" to " Mosque should not be built as it is insensitive to the families of the victims of the Ground Zero". Not all the families of 9/11 victims or first responders are against the project. They have come forward and supported the community center. At the same time some Muslims are vague about building the community center.There are many angles to this discussion; constitutional rights, building bridges, imposition of collective guilt and possibly political gains in the election year.

Hey, Hoynsie: What goes into "finishing off a player at the major-league level?" It seems like we have a bunch of guys who are Class AAA All-Stars that don't make it at the major-league level (e.g., Russ Canzler, Matt LaPorta, Aaron Cunningham). Is it a player/talent problem or a coach/instruction problem?

Lin, you already know well. He had terrific recovery from last week’s Miami meltdown (19 points, 13 assists, one turnover), but the 34-point swing in this one was more about the paint presence of Tyson Chandler and the production of the Knicks’ second unit, notably Davis and Steve Novak.
Superman would use his X-ray vision and super hearing to track down the ill-willed individual who stole from him and hurl mountains if needed to capture him. That Meyer knows only the first name of the man, and can draw just a rough sketch of what he looks like, wouldn't matter.

Ag Field Day, today at Rutgers' Cook Campus in New Brunswick, may get lost amid the campus-wide Rutgers Day and the New Jersey Folk Festival, but it's as much fun as it was in 1906, when the event, then known simply as Field Day, was held at the College Farm.

No. Public funds may not be used to urge the public to contact their legislators or lobby on behalf of the district.

Johnson.
The UO law school case illustrates the difficulties: The two women said they were ashamed and struggled to report the incidents, and the law enforcement inquiry did not find enough evidence to prosecute.

Like Jennifer Lopez whose barely-there dress -- once again -- had some viewers wondering exactly what they had or hadn't glimpsed.

That is how our family did it five years ago when our grandson Julian was 10 months old and we took a Celebrity Cruises ship to Bermuda. Parents and grandparents took turns caring for the baby so everyone could enjoy the ship and the ports. The line provided formula and other baby items and lent us a crate full of toys for Julian to play with and we took care of the rest. If you are planning to use the ship's child care facilities, do research on baby-friendly cruise lines prior to sailing, and make sure you verify the minimum age limits before you book a cruise as these are subject to change. To help you plan, here is a listing from the CruiseCompete.com travel site with information on a variety of cruise lines as well as details from our own research.

“When political leaders fail to denounce anti-Semitic violence and slurs, the void is not only demoralizing to the victims but silence actually enables the wrongdoing,” said Smith, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Silence by elected officials in particular conveys approval—or at least acquiescence—and can contribute to a climate of fear and a sense of vulnerability.”

Garcia grounded the ball to shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt. The Brewers' infield was playing in to cut off the run at the plate, but Freese's break was quick enough and Betancourt's fielding hesitant enough that Freese scored without a throw and Betancourt had to go to first for the sure out.

The format of the test is not at all easy to manipulate. In order to see the questions, students must view the text on a split screen. This split screen does not make it easy to identify text features, graphs, charts, illustrations, or to look back into the source material to prove their answers. The state provided little or no practice materials for students. The state knew this format was coming years ago and refused to update FCAT Explorer. This has been destined to fail, and many students will.
VAWA grants also have supported start-up and operating costs of family justice centers modeled after an organization that opened in San Diego in 2002.

Lovers of "Downton Abbey"will be thrilled to see Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton together again, playing for laughs as well as drama in this coming-of-older-age film.

"Some of the actors for sure didn't know what they were getting into, but it's an impossible place not to have a reaction to," says director John Madden ("Shakespeare in Love"). Madden estimates he has worked with at least half the cast before and that they have all worked with each other at one point, but the feeling on set wasn't one of complacency. "I found it very relaxing because they're all so skilled at what they do, but they are also thinking, 'This could be the one where I fall down,'" says the director. "Even they never lose that sense of being on a high wire." (May 4)

Once, when LeBron carried an ordinary Cavs team all the way to the NBA Finals, there was this idea that he needed less supporting-cast help than anybody else around. He reminded you, more than somewhat, of Larry Bird taking Indiana State to the NCAA finals in 1979. But then the Cavs didn't make it back and LeBron found himself plenty of help in Miami, only then the Heat didn't put the Mavs away when they had the chance.

Two years is a decade at that stage of life. The older friend will get into certain movies sooner, will start high school two years earlier, may start dating sooner and will have his driver's license two years sooner (and your son will not be permitted to ride along, right?). If the older boy is pulling away a bit, you can help your son understand that that's the way it goes sometimes. If your son is eager to keep up with his older bud, you'll have to be sure he doesn't get into age-inappropriate activities, and you'll have to be the bad guy saying, "I don't care if Andrew is (doing/going whatever). You're not."

Brett Favre still hasn't been able to throw a proper pass in practice, but the Vikings still haven't given up hope that he will extend his NFL record for consecutive starts by a quarterback Sunday afternoon. Favre was able to do minimal work in practice Friday for the first time all week, making a few soft tosses to test the sprained joint in his right (throwing) shoulder.

But those recommendations appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Chang and his colleagues used national databases to examine U.S. hospitalizations and surgeries for epilepsy between 1990 and 2010, a period bracketing the Canadian study. They reported in the journal Neurology that the yearly number of epilepsy surgeries remained relatively constant over the entire period, fluctuating between about 300 and 450 cases per year, even while the number of hospitalizations for refractory epilepsy doubled from about 4,000 to about 8,000 per year. As a consequence, the proportion of patients treated surgically declined from 6.9% in 1990-94 to 4.3% in 2004-08. White patients were more likely to undergo surgery than racial minorities, and privately insured patients were more likely than those with Medicaid or Medicare.

For every day this team convinces itself it can make the playoffs, it cheats itself of a day to gather information to make this franchise better down the road.

Blake continued his bromance with Adam by having Raelynn, the 17-year-old country spitfire and the youngest person left in the competition, cover a Maroon 5 song, "Wake Up Call." Adam said Raelynn broke his heart twice, first when she chose Blake over him and now by doing his song so well. Christina is customarily condescending as she is anytime a female sports a character voice with much range, calling her "a sassy little thing" and asking her "Are you allowed to grind your hips at that age?" Hello, Christina? Might be time to check your timeline! Blake says Raelynn is the sound of new Country Music and that there's already a buzz in Nashville about her. Interestingly enough, in rehearsals Raelynn co-opted the much-missed Shields Brothers' catchphrase and says she "wants to punch America in the face with country."

“Luck” has a shorter track to circle, and a head start. There haven’t been many horse racing series -- “Mister Ed” was not a thoroughbred -- and the mediocre ratings for the first episode of “Luck” are no big surprise. It’ll be interesting to see if it builds in the next few weeks. “Deadwood” never got big ratings (neither did “The Wire”), and “Luck” may have the same problem of forming connections with characters that talk more to each other than to an audience. Will anyone care whether Smith gets revenge? Or whether Ace Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) gets revenge? Or whether Escalante mumbles a racing term in Spanish that absolutely nobody can understand, not even the goat that hangs around the stalls? I’m hanging in there, and if “Luck” doesn’t seem authentic enough, I’ll go out to Portland Meadows for some real racetrack atmosphere. Monday and Wednesday are race days; every day is a simulcast day.

The bottom line: If a person has to cough, the elbow is a great place to do it, Goldmann says, and the disposable sleeves might help stop the spread of flu if they encourage kids to cover their coughs.

Funny. When it comes to hilltop crosses, courthouse monuments and a two-word clause in the Pledge of Allegiance, religious liberty is bedrock principle.

By turns salty and spicy with hints of sweet, the Bloody Mary is famed as a "hair of the dog" hangover remedy. To maximize Marys' restorative properties, embrace the spiciness of the tomato juice base and the kick from the vodka, recommends Alvin Seymore, head bartender at St. Regis Hotel. "The secret to a good Bloody Mary is that tingle after you swallow, the slight burn," Seymore says. "A good Bloody Mary arouses the senses. You may still have that hangover, but you'll be able to function because you woke up."

In the early 2000s, the Brewers Association's export development program began sending American craft brewers -- and their beer -- to the Salone del Gusto. For many Italians, it was their first taste of craft beer, and it helped spark and accelerate the development of a craft beer scene in Italy.

While the dessert spread is perfect for Valentine's Day, Elmer says it's a great choice for any special occasion. And the recipes can be used in other ways, as well. She suggests the orange sauce as a nice flavor complement to many chocolate desserts. The mousse can stand alone when it's put in small cups, maybe with a drizzle of the orange sauce over it. And the ice cream recipe makes just enough for a romantic dessert for two.

In a personnel sense, he also benefits from what is generally regarded as a weak class overall.

Mandel's fracking comments came after Brown told a radio interviewer that he understood the desire of the Athens, Ohio, mayor, area county commissioners and the president of Ohio University to preserve their water supply's safety.

Esthetically pleasing waste bunkers that used to run along the edges of the water have been removed to speed up play, but don't underestimate the seemingly innocuous hole  and don't miss the green long or left. Corsaut pulled his approach shot left of the green. He made a double bogey, but had the hole been cut back-left, he would have been in real trouble.
"Who outside of South Florida wants to root for Miami after the way James walked out on Cleveland and his home territory of northern Ohio in a mercenary reach for championship rings? On the other hand, who won’t want to see the three-man super team play with the hope of watching it take a big fall? Had James stayed in Cleveland, he would have had the support of a nation wanting to see The Loyal One rewarded. Teaming up with Wade, Bosh and Darth Riley makes him more antihero than hero — but perhaps an even more marketable commodity for the N.B.A. brand."
Lake Clark National Park is a prime wilderness location, with no human inhabitants except for Wayne, a homesteader since 1967 who lives in a small cabin next to Bear Camp.

Senior citizens are some of the device's most passionate fans, and they tell Gross that they like being able to put aside their spectacles and adjust the font size on an electronic device, especially since the number of large-print books in circulation is limited. Environmentally conscious readers can mentally count up the number of trees that have been saved by eschewing physical books, which have pages made from wood pulp. And avid readers enjoy being able to forgo back strain by carrying dozens, if not hundreds, of titles on a device weighing less than half a pound.
On domestic issues, Mr. Dorrien writes that the president "stood up to the oil lobby on the Keystone XL pipeline." No: What Mr. Obama did was postpone the Keystone decision for political purposes until after the 2012 elections — in the process blocking at least 20,000 new jobs and keeping American consumers unnecessarily dependent on unpredictable regimes for our oil supply.

Girls' Generation is arguably the biggest name in an effervescent, operatic Korean pop music culture that quietly has won a fervent fan base of young Korean Americans, and plenty of non-Koreans as well. K-pop artists pull from techno, hip-hop, R&B and top-40; singles are often focused vehicles for elaborate music videos and rarely less than bonkers good fun. Traditional Korean culture can be patriarchal, but K-pop's most famous acts, whose members often have roots in California, are groups of women deploying butt-kicking superhero imagery.
