DEAR ABBY: On a recent airline flight, a tall man who sat behind me had his left leg out in the aisle during most of the trip. He was wearing shorts, and you could see his large tattoo of a naked woman on his thigh. The drawing was very explicit, and there was no way to avoid seeing it because passengers had to cross over his leg to reach the bathroom.

Schottenheimer also worked with Rams backup Kellen Clemens, who joined the Rams in December after injuries to Sam Bradford and A.J. Feeley. "I'm a big fan of Kellen. We were involved in the drafting of Kellen. He truly did a great job for us, Schottenheimer said. "I've tried to keep up with him when he left. I always pulled for him. Here's a guy who understands what it means to be a pro. It does not surprise me that he came in here and played well. He takes his craft very seriously."
So far, Kyoto seems nothing like its ancient image. That comes when visitors head out toward the temple districts. Because my trips are usually short, I stay at a hotel instead of a guesthouse. When I can afford it, my favorite is the Hyatt, which fuses Japanese and Scandinavian influences of wood and soft lighting into a hotel that is modern but not out of place in the old quarters. It's across the street from the Kyoto National Museum and next door to the Sanjusangendo Temple, where the great annual archery contest is held in January. The temple is famous for 1,000 carved cypress wood statues covered in gold leaf of Kannon Bosatsu, the goddess of mercy. They surround a large statue of Kannon. These are protected by 30 other statues, which include deities over the wind and thunder.

Shredding old documents is one way to avoid becoming a victim.

"I don't think I'll be appealing," Carr said.
NEWARK — A single drop of blood trickles onto a slide. A computer scans it, producing a glowing green image of nearly 25,000 proteins. The image it produces could be from anybody — a healthy person or a patient with a ravaging disease in their brain. But then the computer screens out almost all of the molecules, seeking the presence of just 10 obscure antibodies. If they’re not there, the image goes dark, and the person is healthy.
And James injected light moments in the conversation, exaggerating displeasure for comic effect. The color scheme on one slide evoked thoughts of preparing her son for kindergarten, and his insistence on wearing mismatched socks. She paused over the palette on another slide, pronounced it atrocious and ordered it excised.

In 1794, Susanna Rowson's "Charlotte Temple" appeared in America, becoming the first bestselling novel here by a woman and opening the floodgates for other female novelists.

And where are the playmakers in Washington?

"Also, the regional OTBs who collectively lost money in 2010 will scream like stuck pigs and that would provoke (Dean) Skelos (the State Senate Republican majority leader), who is very tight with the guys who run Nassau OTB, to introduce anti-NYRA legislation for the benefit of the OTBs," the email continues.

About a quarter-mile before hikers reach the sign in front of the cliffside cave dwellings, they find an unmarked cave dwelling about 15 feet from the trail. This one, unlike the cliffside one, is not marked by a sign nor is it visible from the trail. But a little off-trail exploring will help find it.

For cybertheft and cyberattacks, these distinctions are less helpful. Someone sitting at a desk in China could cause damage in California. The culprit may be in China or Chicago, a hacker or foreign spy or foreign uniformed soldier; determining the culprit requires gathering specific information. Intelligence agencies and military authorities have particular expertise in this area, and many relevant intrusions originate abroad. But concerns abound that these outward-facing entities could be turned against American citizens  and used to gather information and build extensive dossiers on our digital lives.

The system worked smoothly, for the most part. Once, though, early in the race, we lingered too long at a rest stop and failed to arrive at the next exchange point in time to meet our runner, who was forced to keep going after 10 miles in the blazing sun. (He wasn't happy.) After that, we forced ourselves to drive, then rest.
An injury to Wright during the regular season would, of course, be worse. But this spring, with the loss of Jose Reyes to free agency and the Miami Marlins, which came on the heels of trading Carlos Beltran to the San Francisco Giants last July, the long days in Florida took on added meaning. Getting Wright, who missed 60 games last season with a back injury, on the field to set an example during drills and during games was going to be critical.
3. Dre Kirkpatrick, Alabama, 6-2, 186. He has the height and long arms to match up with bigger wide receivers. Kirkpatrick was a very productive college player before leaving early. He is very effective pressing. He is better in zone than man. He anticipates well and has decent hands. Kirkpatrick does not have elite speed or movement skills. He did not work out as well as he played. Teams are a little concerned about his personality and judgment.

When Ochsner won an Oregon Book Award for "People I Wanted to Be," she thanked Jesus Christ in her acceptance speech.

A route that is marked fairly well leads west toward a distinctive peak crowned by rocky spires. Beyond that point, the trail becomes much less distinct. Route-finding abilities become a must as you clamber up and around and over bouldery hills, crests and canyon heads. If not for the (very) occasional cairn, you wouldn't know you were on an established route.

Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant coach at the center of the abuse scandal, has been charged with molesting 10 boys over a period of 15 years. He has pleaded not guilty and is on bail, awaiting trial.

Paterno did notify two of his superiors at Penn State.

The cuts stem from rejection of a five-year, 4-mill levy by voters on November 8. In March 2012, residents will have the opportunity to restore lost city financing when three separate levies—one for fire, one for police and one for the service department (including recreation)—appear on the ballot. Even if all three levies pass, the measures will only begin to generate revenue in early 2013. Until then, a number of programs and city workers remain idled.

Angelina Jolie made sure there was no mistaking her intentions. She practically screamed, "Look! My leg!" when she strutted out onstage at the Hollywood & Highland Center and then paused dramatically while jutting out her thin pin. Some said it reeked of desperation on behalf of one of the world's most beautiful women. Others took the "If you've got it, flaunt it," view. And then there was "The Descendants" screenwriter Jim Rash, who aped the stance when he came onstage to accept his Oscar. (He insisted he was not making fun of Jolie. It was an homage, he said.)

Any careful reading of the Bible will show that there are far more warnings about eating unclean meat than there are condemnations of homosexuality. Why are there no huge protests in the evangelical churches about the evils of the pork industry? Could it be that many Christians are selectively focusing on gays because of their own prejudices rather than simply following the word of God?
What allegedly happened in State College, Pa., isn't the nation's first child sex-abuse scandal, but it is no less disturbing. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky faces charges related to abusing at least eight boys over 15 years.

And now Summitt comes to Jersey, perhaps for the last time. If you’re lucky enough to get a seat, you’ll remember this night for the rest of your life, and it will have nothing to do with basketball. It will be about one indomitable lady’s trademark defiance. Her courage.
Response: During the seven years I have served as a Glassboro Councilman, I have worked with the governing body on moving forward with the Rowan Boulevard project and downtown redevelopment.

“It has been part of our doing business with the Giants and Jets for decades,” Samerjan said, noting separately the agency doesn’t have records of how tickets were used in the past. The seat licenses can be sold after March 2011 if the agency chooses to give up the tickets, he said.
Police investigations into hazing were so commonplace that FAMU police even had a "band hazing questionnaire" that it submitted to students. And it appears that hazing wasn't just limited to current band members.

But the report, which was released following a lawsuit filed by North Jersey Media Group, which owns The Record newspaper, offers additional details about the events of Dec. 10.
The infusion trend is not new. But Vino sets itself apart with creative ingredients. My favorite? The delicate, delicious lavender-infused vodka used to make The Duchess. The cocktail smells as floral as it tastes. Prairie organic vodka and St. Germain — an elderflower liqueur — mix to create a clean, honey-flower flavor. Peychaud's bitters expand the aromatic quality, while fresh squeezed lemon adds a citrus bite. A splash of Moscato, the cocktail's real anchor, finishes the drink.
Unfortunately in the penalty-plagued game, the Monsters continued to struggle on their power plays and the team is now 1-for-41 on the season and have not had a power play goal in seven straight games (0-24).

In the lawsuit, the men allege they were aggressively grabbed in the area of their genitals.
Here's an important point: Your fiance would not say, "I love you because I love your mother and you are part of your mother, therefore I love you." That makes his affection for her dependent on his relationship with you and this child is looking for a connection that is uniquely her own. He may want to tell her that he wants to be there for her and she can trust that HE will be around, even if something happens between you and him (although he knows it won't) and he just wants her to know that he's in this for the long haul. He might want to close the conversation by reiterating that if she has something she wants to talk to him about, not to worry about his feelings, he's a grown-up and can handle whatever she dishes out. His job is to be there for the family - and for her if she needs him, and, then let her come to him.

Still, it was the Chinese New Year Parade, a beloved tradition and the second most-watched parade on the West Coast, next to the Rose Parade. Performers, whether on floats or on the streets, aren't supposed to show up naked. They're also not supposed to do a lot of other things they've done, but surprises are part of the deal, and one of the reasons I look forward to it every year.
The Gresham industrial park is different in that utilities and streets were set up to serve high-tech companies, which use lots of water and electricity. And those are the kinds of companies the Port and the city of Gresham hope to attract now that they control the land. Gresham and Port officials said LSI wanted to sell the land intact rather than piecemeal and did not want to get into the development business themselves. But after the recession started there were few large private development companies with money to buy the tract or the patience to take years to develop it.
"When you now provide this alternative help, which is like jet fuel for the CD8s, now the CD8s are responding to things they otherwise wouldn't," Guevara-Patino said.

"Why should the government be in the business of promoting density downtown as opposed to some other part of the city?" asks Randal O'Toole a fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., who lives in Bandon.

The lesson from the new research is not that a colonoscopy isn't worth the yuck factor or the expense but that it's critical to make sure you get the best screening possible. That means choosing a doctor "who does a lot of them and does them well," says David Weinberg, a gastroenterologist who chairs the department of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.
Since 1984, Missouri Accreditation has continued to provide ongoing validation, monitoring and recognition of accredited programs, the "mark" of quality.

That record, which included a win over Oakville and a tie with Lafayette and Francis Howell Central, would have been good enough to send the area squad to the gold bracket semifinals ahead of Lafayette if not for an Illinois rule that limited the number of matches it could play to five.
Other fire officials say they have appropriate staffing levels and that it isn’t a factor in any spike seen in recent weeks, months or years. There are many causes, so an increase in calls may be, in large part, an aberration. But with many people struggling financially for several years now, there are fire officials who wonder if some have neglected to maintain their homes — hitting reset on a faulty breaker rather than calling an electrician to see what’s really wrong.

Wendell Steinhauer, vice president of the New Jersey Education Association, said as a result of this year’s budget cuts school districts were forced to eliminate jobs, cut arts and music classes and charge users fees to students who want to play sports.

The phenomenon is being pondered in the boardrooms of Northwest chains, too. Anyone who's driven past a billboard showing Vancouver-based Burgerville's sweet potato fries or pumpkin shakes knows the 50-year-old company is committed to local, seasonal fare. Cafe Yumm!, a Eugene-based chain with 11 Oregon locations, announced last year they had contracted with a farm near Milton-Freewater to grow the black beans for their signature Yumm Bowl, a mess of brown rice, black beans, veggies, avocado, sour cream and their tangy Yumm Sauce.
He insisted that Kaptur voted against Congressional pay raises and then donated the money she received to charity, and that she is "fully current" on her real estate taxes. He called it a "preposterous lie" for "these right-wing Republicans to say that Marcy doesn't live in her home in Toledo."

The kitchen offers nine small plates and eight entrees, almost half of them seafood, plus a glorious dessert list. The Paleys don't buy into the current fashion of a frequently changing menu. It takes time, Vitaly points out, to perfect a dish. He works with local farmers and fishermen, shops daily to get ideas flowing and drops a dish when the components are no longer at a peak. He never writes a recipe down and can't even recall extraordinary dishes months later. The focus is always forward.
"He used his insider position to jump to the head of the line, buy a condo and take a $50,000 loan from the Housing Department," Alarcon said, surrounded by community and tenant's rights supporters. "Our community deserves better."

Stores, of course, want to carry multiple sizes of different styles, and Howard was thrown by the time commitment for such production. She hoped to find some help, someone with an interest in design and a reverence for her garments, and most of all, someone local, instead of in Los Angeles, New York or China, where so much clothing is made. She asked friends in fashion, but it didn't take long to determine she'd found a niche to fill.

The Pew Hispanic Center recently pointed to a weak U.S. economy and the increased costs of illegal crossings as reducing, perhaps temporarily, the pull factors for illegal immigrants.

* With Lance Berkman mending, it will be interesting to see if teams start looking for other ways to go after Matt Carpenter. He's off to a great start, and usually pitchers will take note of that and adjust. It's a little early to pinpoint trends, but the data shows Carpenter has done very well when pitchers try to go inside on him. Pitchers are pumping a lot of fastballs at Carpenter, and he's fighting them off. But Carpenter has done a lot of damage on mistake pitches, changeups and sliders. He's batting .500 against both of those pitches in the early stages.

(Although, a bloody, pitched fight with Hillary Clinton four years ago didn’t seem to do Obama any harm in his fight against John McCain)
"This is like something you'd see on TV, you know, and then you add in a car chase," he said Monday. "We were actively looking for all four of them because when our officers were at the apartment, it was evident that something had happened there and something was wrong. We definitely wanted to check on the welfare of all four of them, but when he led us on a high-speed chase, it raised our suspicion level very much."
2. The Rams made an interesting hire in bringing in Frank Cignetti as the QB coach. Cignetti left his post as the offensive coordinator at Rutgers. He has vast experience in college football and also put in some NFL time as an assistant at New Orleans and Kansas City. His name probably didn't get many Rams fans excited, which is fine. But I like what I'm hearing. Kevin Weidl of ESPN tweeted this: "Good hire by the Rams. One of the more underrated developers of QBs and should help Sam Bradford immensely."

Everyone reacts differently to the place, and to India, but all do so in a manner as predictable as tea and biscuits in the afternoon. (We even learn the proper way to enjoy them, as a matter of fact.) Evelyn and Douglas find a vibrancy in the chaos of the place; Norman, a conquest (ha! -- a Norman conquest); Graham, a curiously timed resolution and so forth. Even Sonny's romance with the thoroughly modern Sunaina (Tena Desae), frowned upon by his tradition-bound mother (Lillete Dubey), is well-traveled ground.

Why: Dolcetto is Piedmont's everyday treat, something to keep glasses full while Barolo matures. But there's nothing uncomplicated about the version from Barbaresco producers Alfredo and Luca Roagna, traditionalists to the core. Here's a high-wire act of a Dolcetto, sourced from Barbaresco's Paje site, full of plum, suede and anise. The 2009 has enough acidity that decanting will help. In return, you're rewarded with the depths of Dolcetto, proof that even the humble can shine in proper Piedmontese hands. (Importer: Louis/Dressner Selections)

øWealthfront is a new concept that tries to blend the automated approach. As with the others, the system quizzes you and measures your appetite for risk. It then matches you with a portfolio that suits your needs. The portfolios are largely made up of Vanguard's family of exchange traded funds. The system, too, can execute the trades so you don't have to worry about buying and selling. Wealthfront takes a cut of your portfolio's value as a fee. The first $25,000 you invest carries no fee. After $25,000, you pay a 0.25% fee of your assets.

But there is much more than 15 historic buildings and their appraisal that needs to be considered. Attaching a dollars and cents value to each building is one thing, but what about what they represent to the history of the city and our state? What are their best and most economically viable uses? Is the appraisal firm the best qualified and most appropriate to determine these? What have other municipalities' done to preserve and adaptively reuse their government-owned properties?
Hub to cut costs. Even on routes with nonstops, however, you can sometimes find a lower fare on connecting flights. I just received a press release from Finnair, for example, that promotes round-trips from its U.S. gateways to Moscow, via a Helsinki connection, that are about $200 less than round-trips from those same gateways just to Helsinki. For travel next spring, Polish airline LOT is currently pitching connections to a handful of major European cities through Warsaw that undercut nonstops by as much as $400. These cases illustrate a common situation on long-haul routes. Even though flying you nonstop costs the airline less than making you connect, airlines know that many of you will pay a premium for the convenience of a nonstop. The result: connecting fares that undercut nonstops. You see this quite often on long-haul trips within the U.S. and from the U.S. to Europe. The big airfare search engines are pretty good at posting these deals: On Expedia, for example, the summary box for any trip search often shows lower one-stop fares than nonstop fares.

What Coach Patsos did in the past isn’t terribly relevant. While his coaching tactics and sideline (or bleacher) antics have garnered the wrong kind of attention, he has proven this year that there’s an actual basketball coach inside that basketball coach. In covering him for The Greyhound, I’d always walk away knowing I’d spoken to a man who cared about the program and what it could become more than anything. Sure, he used to be a bartender in Georgetown living in Gary Williams' shadow at Maryland. Now, he’s a program-builder who will have his team ready to play Thursday night. He’s coached with and against the greats in tournament situations before, and don’t be surprised if he’s drawing on those experiences and past lessons in preparation for the tournament.
Many of the chief performers in Newsies played the same roles last fall, when Disney Theatricals mounted the show as a pilot production at Paper Mill Playhouse in upstate New Jersey.

Which, given its polish and pizzazz, is just where it belongs.

"Although the quest film has subsequently returned, most contemporary films that show teen sex have done so in a downbeat manner; while the 2007 summer smash 'Superbad' seemed to reverse this trend, the next popular success about teens, 'Juno' (2007), returned the emphasis on teen sex to its predictable filmic conclusion, pregnancy," McDonald wrote.
The quarterly report came at the request of the Board of Education before approval of a one-year contract with the new vendor 4-1 last June.

• Night Of Super Finishes And More -- John Hollinger, ESPN.com: A game so close that you could point to a number of different turning points. But boil it down and the reason the Hawks won their fourth straight without Al Horford, while the Blazers went to their fourth defeat in five outings, is pretty simple: In the biggest moments, Josh Smith came up bigger than LaMarcus Aldridge. In Horford's absence Smith had to step up and check Aldridge one-on-one on repeated crunch-time post-ups, and he did it without any double-team help. Aldridge's failure to attack played into Smith's hands too ... as did his two misses from the free-throw line with 1:25 left. Meanwhile, Smith came off Aldridge to block a Gerald Wallace layup that could have tied the game with 2:48 to go, and followed it with a jumper a the other end to give the Hawks a two-possession lead; Portland never again had the ball with a chance to tie.

The scoop: Returning three starters will put the Ducks ahead of where they were at the start of the 2011 season when they returned two.
