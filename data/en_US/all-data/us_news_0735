"There's not a whole lot of fried chicken flying out our door," he says.
Soul Dog also stocks sausages — perhaps the chicken andouille or vegetarian apple-sage — and you can build your own dog too. But not every meat here has to be tubed. Consider instead a basket of fried chicken, a few crunchy, deeply golden pieces that speak to the kitchen's skill beyond the bun.
The most significant change has been the food from Reddington and Jake Kossmann. Reddington also hired Liza Shaw, former A16 chef, who lends her distinctive touch to the pizzas. Under this dynamic team, the food is no longer just passable - it's superb.

The Berea Homes Estates, a government housing project on the north end of the city, was built to accommodate the many workers at the Cleveland Bomber Plant, also known as the Cleveland Tank Plant. A photo in the display shows thousands of workers standing in an orderly line, one behind the other, that wrapped around the facility. More than 8,000 applicants came through the front door during the hiring process.
That's the strategy employed by James Marsh's sublime 2008 Oscar-winning documentary "Man on Wire," a movie that has nothing, and everything, to do with the aftermath of Sept. 11. "Man on Wire" conjures the newly minted World Trade Center towers by recounting the real-life story of an elfin, charismatic French tightrope artist, Philippe Petit, who walked a high wire between them for about 45 minutes on Aug. 7, 1974, while crowds gazed in wonder from the streets below.

Asked about the ethics of voting for a colleague without specific knowledge of his or her position on a bill, de León noted that a legislator who did not like the way his or her vote was cast could later change it for the record. House rules allow an Assembly member to change his or her vote after a bill has been passed or rejected - up to the end of the day's session - as long as it does not alter the outcome.
Some will enjoy the many ker-blammy shootout scenes (I was bored by them), but the best parts are the reflective opening and closing, which actually present some interesting thoughts on the nature of the warrior class that is so central to so much of American history and yet so mysterious. Lose a loved one, and you’re advised to “Put your pain in a box, lock it down.” There might be some truth to that.
The Kings invited the area's top two football recruits  Shaq Thompson of Grant and Arik Armstead of Pleasant Grove  to a home game in a show of appreciation for their achievement, including scholarship deals with Washington and Oregon, respectively. No go. An NCAA compliance director instructed Kings director of public relations Chris Clark that tickets would be deemed a perk and an NCAA violation. Kudos to Clark for checking first.
Never mind spiking the football after Osama bin Laden’s death; President Obama has turned his re-election campaign into one big end-zone dance.
Mostly, it is something built on the shoulders of athletic giants, perpetuated with an embrace of whatever heritage they authored. Maybe it’s not the most illustrious NBA tradition, but it’s theirs. Some don’t think the Nets have any.
Taxpayers also continue to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to maintain the Ameritrust property, which includes a 28-story tower, historic rotunda and cluster of surrounding buildings that once housed a bank.
A deep, sustaining, timeless friendship is rare and at times hard to find, maintain or believe in. It is priceless, a gift and a treasure. A friend is someone who knows all about you and likes you just the same. My favorite friendship greeting is a hearty New York City "Haya Doin?".
Baron was let go from the school district but saw no reason to stop. Over the last year he's organized an intensively planted garden in San Pedro, shaded by cypress trees and full of birds and butterflies. One morning, he works with culinary students from Carson High, ignoring the tentative way they bend over to plant ranunculus bulbs or sunflower seeds, one hand holding up their jeans. He takes aside a boy using his cellphone and, without a reprimand, partners with him to pick flowers and herbs.

I hope you've enjoyed reading my first column, and I look forward to keeping you up to date with my season.
I was happy to see that Emily returned to X-ing the face of her target in this episode. However, this one she did before he was actually taken out, which wasn’t quite as fun. Between the constant lighter references, the all-wood house and Mason proudly declaring that he kept only one copy of his memoir, I doubt any of us were too surprised when we saw that house go up in flames. As Nolan commented, Mason's one hard copy of his manuscript and use of a physical dictionary, opposed to the Internet, were "like the cave man," and wasn’t fire the cave man’s biggest fear?
Britney Spears’ former Beverly Hills home, now in the hands of a court-appointed conservatorship, is for sale. Owned by Spears in the mid-2000s during the height of her status as a tabloid staple, the multistory home is located in Los Angeles County’s gated community known as The Summit.

In elegant prose, he conjures the Ottoman Empire of antiquity, a multilingual, multicultural realm that spanned three continents, unshackled by borders. In Shadid's somewhat idealized rendering, the Ottoman world was one of dignity, time-honored traditions and grandeur. It was also a world where a poor man with ambition and drive could make something of himself.
Replace those terrible teachers at the bottom with the terrific teachers from the top? A delusion. We know a large part of the problem lies beyond the classroom, though we are far from completely understanding the interaction of culture and poverty on learning. Has the ODE helped Ohio taxpayers understand what some districts are up against? Not in the least.
In a move to align the system with new common core standards set forth by the state, central office proposed last year to remove traditional reading classes, and infused reading in all content area classes.

"What happened was, we were in a rock 'n' roll band, and we were very lucky because we got to go to Hollywood. We were on MGM Records.

The Oregon Legislature kept alive a corporate tax break that it had intended to allow to expire in hopes of landing a new business that is considering opening a $100 million facility at the Port of Morrow in Boardman.
“No logical reason exists for these agencies to continue to use tax dollars to finance themselves. Numerous studies have declared California special districts ‘ineffective' and ‘redundant'. However, their operational independence, from not only city, county and state government, but also local tax-paying citizens has perpetuated their existence. While each performs actual or perceived necessary services, the continued independent structure of some special districts has become ‘unnecessary or obsolete.'
Christie said he had also pulled a resolution for a board vote before the Port Authority on a $500 million contract to advance the project.
SCHLADMING, Austria — The World Cup season ended Sunday, but there's still work to be done. This week we will be testing new skis for next season, and that's going to be more important than usual because of the restrictions the FIS is imposing next season on sidecut.

It had to do with sleep. Specifically, how lame it is to go to bed at 10 p.m. Which rubbed me the wrong way, since for me, a fitness enthusiast who generally tries to stay sharp, 10 p.m. is frankly on the later side. Now, this was not a medical program. Sleep was not the main topic, and there were no experts on hand to counter the host's opinion. The broader issues that day were actually marriage, children, and their deleterious effects on one's hipness.

"They have a very good team over there," Winterhawks captain William Wrenn said. "I've noticed there's been a lot of momentum swings. It's back and forth every game no matter if it's home or away.

"Holy Grail," which was shot on a shoestring, spoofs the King Arthur legend and features the cast of the popular "Monty Python's Flying Circus" TV series.

One initiation is provided by war, which shows Alex all the brutality of life. More initiations come from Magda, the older woman who saves him from fairy attack. She's a young man's fantasy — nurturing and sensual, protective and erotic, a healer. Oh, one other thing: She's a witch. She doesn't deny it; instead she insists that her witchcraft is only a means of celebrating nature. She fails to tell Alex for a long time that she once attempted to bring her son, also a soldier, back from the dead. Simple oversight, right?

Today’s opening-round victory over the Red Storm was a perfect example of that. Gibbs led his team with 20 points, making four of his nine 3-point attempts.

The canoe glides past submerged boulders, cobblestones, trees and exposed roots. Around Sunrise Avenue, towering clay cliffs reveal thousands of years of geology. The river has carved strange mesa structures from clay so hard that it acts like bedrock. Clay defines the river as it cascades through the San Juan rapids, creating haystacks, eddies, whirlpools and boils. Seeking a balance between erosion and deposits, it cuts into the cliffs on one side and places gravel on the other. In high volume, the river wants to cut a deeper channel, but the clay resists. When it can't incise, the river widens. Up to the levees.
"The handling of this matter by the Chicago police and the Cook County state's attorney's office raises questions that cry out for objective, unbiased investigation," the attorneys write, "including a.) whether police investigators prepared false official reports; b.) whether police investigators, ASA O'Brien and/or other employees of the Cook County state's attorney's office conspired to cover up Mr. Vanecko's criminal responsibility for Koschman's death; and c.) whether Mr. Vanecko should be charged in connection with that death."

A promising dish of baby octopus ($12.95) was marred by an overly sweet sauce.

96. James Hanna, TE, Oklahoma, 6-4, 252. If you want a punishing blocker at the position, draft somebody else because this is a guy with 4.49 speed who can go get the ball in the passing game. His 40 time was the fastest among the tight ends at the combine. He would be an ideal fit for a team that already has a productive blocker at the position because Hanna could contribute as a receiver right from his first practice.

Students weren't the only ones celebrating.
I'm glad for Jeff Samardzija that he's made the rotation to start the season and I hope he has a great year, but I've never heard someone with such a checkered MLB record give such haughty statements to the press (e.g. "If they tell me it's not best for the team for me not to be in the (rotation), I'd like to hear the reasons why ... Ultimately, it's their call. But I feel like you build from the front back, not the back to the front.") And during spring training at that. Should the Cubs add a hubris consultant to go along with the team's nutritionist and psychologist? I guess they must have stopped teaching Greek tragedy at Notre Dame. Tom, Chicago
The Energy Information Administration's revised forecast is encouraging news for the economy. Some economists blame high pump prices for so-so consumer spending this year. They were also seen as a factor in the loss of 35,000 retail jobs in February and March.
CLEVELAND -- The Indians have scored nine runs and are hitting .190 (23-for-121) during the past four games. They have lost three of them, including two straight to a Kansas City team that pulled into Progressive Field on Tuesday with a 12-game losing streak.

In 2008, using the Freedom of Information Act, the Free Press obtained homicide records from the Detroit Police Department for the past five years. The department did not keep electronic files of homicides until 2005, so some data were extracted from handwritten ledgers. The Free Press has since obtained records complete through June. It also received less-detailed records showing homicides through Nov. 6.
The two-hour session will cover all aspects of monetary planning, from establishing personal finances to setting and achieving economic goals.

This part of Route 50 follows the Overland Trail (a 19th-century stagecoach trail) and the Pony Express route over incredible deserts. The countryside just hasn't changed much since the mid-1800s. You can see enormous distances — the road in some spots is so straight that your eye almost can't comprehend the distance you are taking in. It just melts into the horizon. You're so far out in the middle of nowhere, you can't get anything on the radio; the dial just keeps spinning around.

Kerr's bottom line: There's only one player who could keep the fire stoked for 82 games, through the bone-dragging months of winter. That man was the unretired Michael Jordan, who was returning to the NBA for his first full season, playing for $3.85 million and nightly pound of flesh.
* Ryan Franklin didn't have it Tuesday night. He's a pitch-to-contact guy, and pitchers who can't get swings and misses at Coors Field are vulnerable to having a batted baseball land in the wide open spaces there. A lot of times, they're set up to take a beating -- as helpless as one of Manny Pacquiao's sparring partners. So this is what I don't understand: why didn't Tony La Russa stop the fight? Mitchell Boggs was in the bullpen, fresh and able. Boggs to me has been one of the more interesting (if quiet) success stories of the season. Since May 27, he's pitched

Previously, I had walked every street within the ring of fire. Past every landmark still in existence -- often without knowing it. My quest to walk every street in San Francisco, which began three years ago, has inspired me to explore the history, geography and architecture of the city and to trace the roots of my family, which survived the quake and fire and has called this city home for five generations.

Sean Meagher: This was the LaMarcus Aldridge we were all waiting for. The LaMarcus Aldridge Nate McMillan knew he could be. He carried the Blazers during long stretches when this team could have completely sank. His numbers during January and February speak for themselves and reflect the determination and dedication Aldridge has to being a top tier player in the NBA. He proved he can be a No. 1 option for the Blazers. He dragged a bit down the stretch due to playing heavy minutes, more than a handful of games at center, and, unlike some at his position, defense along with his offense. It'll be interesting to see what he has planned for improving this summer and if Rich Cho can get him some help off the bench.

My husband wanted to try either the pastitsio ($12.95) or the braised lamb pasta. He chose the later. Roasted-lamb-shank meat is pulled off the bone, tossed with portabella mushrooms and asparagus then added to a light tomato-based sauce and served over fettuccine noodles. It’s then topped with fresh tomatoes and just a hint of mint. I loved the blend of flavors and tender lamb.
Perhaps crew chief Joe West acted along the same lines on Sept. 4 when he used instant replay to review a disputed play in a game between the Phillies and Marlins.

"Bee Season," which was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, paints an idyllic picture of the family at the outset. (It does so almost literally -- a painterly glow suffuses Giles Nuttgens's cinematography.) The Naumanns seem as cultivated as they are prosperous. Saul plays string duets with his high-school-age son, Aaron (a fine performance by Max Minghella). Aaron helps his kid sister with Hebrew lessons for her bat mitzvah. Yet there's a harbinger of what's to come when Saul insists that Eliza understand the meaning of every Hebrew word, rather than learn her lessons by rote, and his wife, Miriam (Juliette Binoche) tells him he's being a bully. Eliza's fate is sealed once she manifests her eerie gift for visualizing the words she must spell correctly in a spelling bee. Saul, a student of Jewish mysticism, has failed to find God through Kabala, but he will strive to make his daughter a corrected version of himself.

The Cardinals backed Lynn (1-0) and won their first series against division rival Milwaukee with an encore of unrelenting offense. For the third time in four games, the Cardinals had at least 13 hits. Three Cardinals had three hits apiece, starting with leadoff hitter Rafael Furcal's third three-hit performance in four games this season. Furcal's 10 hits are as many in 19 at-bats this season as he had in 52 at-bats during his frustrating spring training.

“It’s good to see him battle because I still think Tommy’s got a lot better stuff than what he had [Tuesday],” said catcher Matt Wieters, who hit his team-leading sixth homer of the season. “His location wasn’t quite what we wanted it to be. You’re going to have 30-plus starts, it’s nice to get a win when you don’t have your best stuff, because you’re not going to have your best stuff every time out.”
Arbabsiar, Shakuri and Shahlai and two others — Qasem Soleimani, a Quds commander who allegedly oversaw the plot, and Hamed Abdollahi, a senior Quds officer who helped coordinate — were sanctioned Tuesday by the Treasury Department for their alleged involvement.

That did not prove the case last season, although the Heat did out-talent opponents until a come-from-ahead loss to Dallas in the NBA Finals. Despite a previous year of getting to know each other, in this compressed season's accelerated schedule, Miami, even more than before, often seems like an aggregation of talents, rather than a team.

You wonder why the Rams invested so much effort landing this kid and will now spend even more effort carefully nurturing him with round-the-clock hands-on tutoring? Just listen to someone who knows Brockers best. "This is a young man who understands that what he's just done by becoming a first-round draft pick isn't the end of the journey," says Michael Jackson, Brocker's high school coach. "Mike understands that this wasn't the end of the dream. It is just the beginning. St. Louis probably doesn't know it, because they think drafting a defensive tackle isn't all that sexy. But tell them they're getting a beast. Tell them they're getting a kid who will come in with his lunch pail and work every day because that's what he's done every day of his life."

After 60 days, on May 20, Obama wrote to congressional leaders noting that since April 4, US "participation" has involved "non-kinetic support" (intelligence, logistics, refueling) -- but also decidedly kinetic attacks on Libyan air defenses and other targets of "the NATO-led" forces. He said US support is "crucial" but "we are no longer in the lead."

For instance, humus is covered with negative charges, which keep positively charged plant foods, such as potassium, from washing out of the soil.
It is a word that hearkens back to God's blessing of creation in Genesis. We are the good seed, sown for God's good purposes. We are called to cultivate natural resistance to weeds by growing in faith. Yet that call to faithful discipleship may be hard to remember, especially on days when the sun beats down on you, when the evil cheat weeds threaten you, when the ground around us is baked by the heat. When our lives become choked by weeds, it is easy to forget that we are good seed. Not perfect, of course, and for that reason we should cultivate an appreciation of those near us we quickly judge to be weeds. As in the parable, the fruits of the seeds are only fully revealed at harvest.
Missouri officials opposed the possible breach, saying it could inundate 130,000 acres of farmland and crush the region's economy and environment by possibly covering the land under feet of sand and silt and rendering it useless. But their efforts to block a blast failed to sway a federal judge, an appeals court and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who without elaborating Sunday rejected the state's latest and perhaps final bid to stop the corps from sacrificing the levee.

A British journalist and scholar, Polonsky took a particular interest in Molotov after moving into an apartment building near the Kremlin, intending to start work on a new book. The building, one of Moscow's grandest, once had been home to many of the Soviet elite, including Molotov, Leon Trotsky and several of the Soviets' greatest generals. Molotov's old apartment, directly upstairs from Polonsky's, still belonged to his granddaughter, who had rented it to a wealthy American banker. It still contained many of the henchman's old possessions, including a magic lantern and a portion of his once-extensive library. One day, the banker invited Polonsky to rummage through it.

It may be that this "Wolfman"—which revives a storyline based more on Hollywood mythology than any particular ethnic fable—was misshapen from the cradle. The usually admirable Benicio Del Toro, portraying Victorian stage actor/lycanthrope-to-be Lawrence Talbot, is the worst casting choice in recent memory: Too old and plush to play the Byronic hero, he's also burdened with a modified Moe Howard haircut and a voice that loses us at "Hello"—a greeting that Mr. Del Toro delivers with all the authority and resonance of the Kim Jong Il marionette in the South Park team's "Team America." (I'm sorry; I can't get him out of my mind). Mr. Del Toro's Talbot, returning to his family's ancestral mansion in 1891 Blackmoor, finds that his missing brother's shredded corpse has been discovered in a drainage ditch and that his father (Anthony Hopkins) has apparently been dipping into the laudanum cabinet. As his fellow Blackmoorites, fueled by vigilante instincts and invective from the pulpit, pursue the "local lunatic," Lawrence transitions from hunter to hunted: A bite from the marauding creature dooms him to a future as a hairy homicidal maniac, one who can remove the limbs, heads and even hearts of his pursuers so quickly he can barely be seen.
Speaking to a joint hearing of the council's Transportation and Waterfronts Committees, Mr. Sullivan and executives from the Economic Development Corp., which administers the ferry with a $3.1 million annual subsidy from the city, said ridership has already well exceeded expectations.

After a driving layup by Wade got Miami within 82-76 with 5:42 left, Williams hit a short floater, a driving layup and a 3-pointer to restore Cleveland's lead to 89-76. It gave the Cavs just enough of a cushion to withstand the final push from Wade and the Heat.

"I think anybody that you've talked to today will tell you in their careers they have been through a season like we've been through this season. Certainly, in my 25 years, I haven't been. So we're going to do everything that we need to do to make sure that we put ourselves in a position not to go through the season that we just did."
Humor's a good ingredient for all writing, Mlodinow said. But what's an absolutely essential ingredient? Passion.
The program, which began in 1997, allows an employee to officially retire but continue working for up to five years. During that period, the employee receives a salary and collects a pension. The pension goes into a special account that can't be touched until the worker leaves the city payroll. That account then receives a set interest rate, which had been as high as 8 percent in years past but is currently 1.9 percent.

When Davidson was a lad of about 10 or 11, he would vacation with his grandparents Mel and Jo Lax in Florida. On rainy days, they took him down to the video store to pick out some movies.

The appeal of the permit denial at this stage has been limited to challenging whether the city enforced its ordinance properly, not whether First Amendment rights have been infringed. But if the protesters decide to appeal in court, they would address constitutional issues, said Jeffrey Frank, a lawyer for the protesters.
As much as Bryant wanted to put his stamp on this game, he knew it was all about Gasol and Bynum restoring their reputations. It probably worked to the Lakers' advantage that Bryant appeared a bit fatigued, having fought through an illness to play Game 6, for he had no problem being a facilitator.

Still a classic at the restaurant where it was born, a layered composition of sweetnesses and richnesses that have no reason to work together, but are snapped into cohesiveness by the crisp tartness of thinly shaved green apple. There was the mandatory Modernist Explosion—in this case a plump raviolo in a light squid broth that burst into a nuanced gush of warm, buttery squid ink when you popped it with your tongue. A fennel "risotto," with tiny, sautéed dice of the bulb, foamed fennel juice and slivered raw fennel, explored the nuances of that vegetable with an obsessiveness straight out of primo Ducasse.
"We all know where we'll be at the end. It's just a matter of time before everything starts stringing together."

Fowler has previously said that it has been difficult for larger retailers to find space on Pratt Street because available spaces tend to be small — in the 3,000-square-foot range — while stores typically build in the 30,000-square-foot to 50,000-square-foot range. The Downtown Partnership was working with some property owners there to find ways to expand available space.

As our budget planning team began to build the proposed budget recommendations for 2012-2013, I shared with them the Stockdale Paradox (discussed in the Jim Collins book "Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't"). Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for seven years, described his philosophy this way: "You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end -- which you can never afford to lose -- with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be." This paradox parallels our scenario:

Gasol's easygoing and deferential personality and approach to the game has mostly complemented Bryant's gruff and dominant demeanor and on-court play. Their differing offensive philosophies often spark Gasol to lament passive-aggressively about the need for more floor balance, while Bryant often dictates that execution through his own play. So it remains to be seen whether Gasol will tactfully keep Bryant in check the way Fisher managed.

Interpreting spring: Winter is cold, summer hot. Fall begins with Santa Ana conditions and ends with some of our chilliest days. And then there's spring. You could call it the "warm" season, but that ignores all the blustery days. April showers bring May flowers, yes, but they also usher in occasional May showers. So when a brewery issues a "spring" beer, you wonder: which spring?
