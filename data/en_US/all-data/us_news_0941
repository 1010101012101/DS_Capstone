Now the studio will scramble to land a new director in the next few weeks in order to film its sequel — the second in a planned series of four "Hunger Games" movies — this year. Although Ross has already laid much of the groundwork by establishing a tone for "The Hunger Games" series and helping to cast the lead actors, the new director will face a daunting task. He or she will have just a few months to prepare for what will probably be a $100-million-plus production, working with an unfinished script. Perhaps most significantly, the director will face intense pressure from Lionsgate, which has seen its financial fortunes transformed by the success of the recent movie.
The U.S. Agriculture Department predicted Thursday that corn production will total a record 14.8 billion bushels. That compares with 12.4 billion bushels a year ago and it's 11% higher than the previous record crop in 2009. The government also predicts a record yield of 166 bushels per acre.

"What this data suggests is that there's likely to be a tendency to err on the side of treatment" when a patient complains to his or her physician about generally low mood or energy, said Narrow. In such cases, referring a patient to psychotherapy, or recommending behavioral changes such as reducing alcohol consumption or getting more sleep and exercise would be a preferable first step, he added. But for a physician pressed for time, a prescription might seem a better bet.

Only a few noble misses  an overly spicy soup, an oddly flavored sweetbreads dish  kept this category from being "very good." The gourmet burger is among the best in town, the housemade pastas are excellent, the pork belly is an artistic treat, the scallops and risotto are spot on and the desserts are a simple pleasure. The wine list, mixed drinks and craft beers are all impressive.
Sparkling: Don't aim for Champagne at this price, but you should still drink like it's Champagne. And so I tapped the 2008 Raventos i Blanc de Nit Cava Rosado ($20, 12%, Vinos Unico). Raventos continues to make cava that easily rivals Champagne, and the de Nit rosé finds extra depth by adding a touch of red Monastrell (Mourvedre) to the typical mix, giving it an earthy depth. Hell, you could drink this all through the meal.

Each summer, a select group of players is ticketed for a quantum leap through the standings, rocketing, in some cases, from last place to first place quicker than you can say non-waiver trade deadline. The late-season swaps between the contending and the collapsed allows players like Cleveland pitchers Kerry Wood and Jake Westbrook to go to bed in last place and start the next day in first, jumping a combined 38½ games in the standings. Still others, mostly younger players, experience a standings plummet. Here are the biggest climbers and the swiftest fallers from all trades in the past month (the change in standings is true for the day of the transaction):

Congratulations on getting it right on FCAT. You nailed it. I have been in education a very long time. And standardized testing should be only a small part of the overall process.

Mexico simply does not have the resources to fight this many-headed monster on all fronts. Calderón, under increasing attack as the body count becomes intolerable, needs to find a way to reduce the violence before the 2012 presidential election. The most likely options are inviting foreign intervention or brokering a truce — restoration of the balance of power — among the cartels. Both are politically perilous, but this year is likely to bring a move toward one or the other.

But I wonder, as a baseball fan, don't you want a little drama? Isn't that what makes sports fun? Don't you want to feel nervous, as you look at the standings in mid-August, and realize the Tigers really could miss the playoffs? I didn't think so.

The first time I was asked to assist at a Baptism, I was in the discernment process, in effect studying for ordination, and was pretty sure I could handle the job I'd been given: to hold the priest's Prayer Book while he baptized a baby. We Episcopalians are quite attached to our Prayer Books. The Book of Common Prayer has both a symbolic and a practical place within the tradition that is peculiar, in the best sense of the word. All of our primary worship services-Baptism, Eucharist, the Pastoral Offices (things like Marriage, Reconciliation, and Burial services), the Daily Offices-and so much more are included in a single volume, rich with historical and theological significance. The basic idea behind it, revolutionary in its time, was that any person could have access to the words and rubrics of the Church's worship--any person, regardless of status, rank, or order. I knew I was really an Episcopalian when I had an anxiety dream that included a pile of Prayer Books that were missing key pages-and in my dream I knew the right page numbers for the Prayers of the People! But I digress.

In "Why Bother?" from 2002's collected essays, "How to Be Alone," Franzen argues that novels shouldn't be expected "to bear the weight of our whole disturbed society," yet wonders, "To write sentences of such authenticity that refuge can be taken in them: Isn't this enough? Isn't it a lot?" The essays in "Farther Away" are rigorous, artful devotions navigating morally complex topics. At the heart of this collection are the ways "engagement with something you love compels you to face up to who you really are." Collectively, they are a source of authenticity and refuge -- a way out of loneliness.

The Seton Hall University School of Law Center for Social Justice will probably appeal the case to the New Jersey Supreme Court. At the Supreme Court level, it will most likely be successful, because the state Supreme Court is known for making the state spend money that it does not have, which violates the separation of powers clause, wherein only the Legislature has the authority to appropriate funds.
Mr. Brody makes Jack's suffering more compelling than you might think, and the story involves time travel, which gets Jack out of his drawer, at least intermittently, and into the life of a young woman played by Keira Knightley. But the script, by Massy Tadjedin, feels as if it had been written in an airless box, and the director, John Maybury, doesn't miss a discomfiting beat. If claustrophobia's your style, "The Jacket" is a perfect fit.

This, of course, is the problem with being associated with successful, classy, verbally driven television series such as "30 Rock" or "The Office": You so rarely get to hang off the end of a car. Like the abrasive big-screen "Get Smart" (starring Carell) and the synthetic-formula " Baby Mama" (starring Fey), "Date Night" is a product substantially inferior to the material routinely finessed by Carell and Fey, on their respective hit shows, into comic gold.

I see foraging as a bit different from gleaning, because gleaners tend to talk about fruit and nuts as objects, as a way to maximize and redistribute "waste" as "resources." I see foraging as more of a primal relationship between equals, relating to plants as beings, a way of participating in the gathering part of the hunting and gathering of our heritage.
State guest worker initiatives like the Utah law fostered by a Republican administration and the Mormon and Catholic churches (and instantly denounced by nativists, liberal advocacy groups and the Obama administration) have much to be said for them. Those quick to assert a federal monopoly over immigration forget that until the 1920s, more than 20 states allowed resident aliens to vote, and at least a half-dozen states in the Upper Midwest had commissioners of immigration recruiting immigrants. Congressional power over naturalization was then exercised to permit state judges to conduct naturalization ceremonies and to determine compliance with the five-year residency requirement. Assimilation was fostered by state English literacy requirements and related educational programs. The extent of federal preemption depends on the precise terms of federal statutes, as the Supreme Court recently reminded us in upholding Arizona's requirement that employers resort to a federal computer system to check immigration status.

The Giants made the playoffs in 2006 with just an 8-8 record? Well, the final loss of that season was a 30-7 blowout at the hands of the Saints at Giants Stadium. The day actually started well for the Giants when Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress for a 55-yard touchdown to start the scoring. But the Saints reeled off 30 unanswered points, fueled by 236 rushing yards — 126 from Reggie Bush and 108 from Deuce McAllister. The Giants would end up losing, 23-20, in the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Eagles.

A number of factors may go into South America's success, from the fact that the smaller nations' entire rosters don't play in the meat-grinder seasons in Europe and are a tad fresher, to the tough competition that comes from the challenging qualifying process - South America plays as one group, so everyone plays everyone twice - to the fact that European countries historically haven't traveled well. No European team has ever won a World Cup outside Europe.

I can assure you that Toub coaches up Hester when Hester uses poor judgment. Toub is known as a coach who does not go easy on his players, which may have something to do with why the Bears special teams are consistently among the best in the NFL. I don't believe Hester's judgment is as erratic as you appear to be suggesting though. Don't get me wrong. There are times when Hester does some of the things you wrote about. But it's not like he makes all of those mistakes consistently. Sometimes Hester turns what look like mistakes in judgment, or even physical mistakes, into great plays. You know, the plays that make you yell, "No! No! No yes. Yes! Yes!" When you have a creative genius like Hester, sometimes you just have to let him create. It's not always going to look pretty. But you can't argue with the body of work.
But James and the Heat ended the suspense quickly. They were ruthlessly efficient offensively, hitting 14 of 21 shots from behind the 3-point arc. At the other end, Miami kept the Cavaliers out of the paint. Just nine of the Cavs' first 29 shots were within a few feet of the basket. They settled for jumpers, which fueled the Heat's transition game.

After two Saginaw sailors died when their boat WingNuts capsized in last summer's Chicago to Mackinac race, the debate for race planners this year has been all about determining a boat's stability index -- the point of no return where a boat is knocked so far over, it continues to roll into capsize instead of righting itself.

Worst PR: Disney's Aulani Resort. I get a lot of lame public relations pitches during the year (along with a few brilliant and many good ones). The dud-of-the-year award goes to Disney's luxurious new resort in Hawaii. A large box arrived, which I opened to find a thatched box with a note on top: "We've been having trouble with mischievous Menehune – if there is anything wrong with this package, go to ahulanidisneyresort.com." And, of course, the box is empty. All that wasted material to send a dumb joke.

Yet history is dotted with attempts to systematize calendars. The Julian calendar was named for Julius Caesar, who instituted it in 46 B.C. after recognizing that the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the sun isn't neatly divisible by the time it takes for the Earth to rotate about its axis.

Still, even the year-over-year data (which make seasonal variations irrelevant) look impressive. The economy added 1.6 million jobs from December 2010 to December 2011, according to the latest estimates. Some economists, however, believe this is also exaggerated. The job-count numbers are based on payroll samples via unemployment insurance reports. But those, too, are subject to error. We'll get a much better picture of 2011 next month, when the Labor Department trues up its job-growth with more complete payroll counts.

Second, skip the beef and go with bison for a full, meaty flavor. Bison has about a third less fat than 90 percent lean beef, however, so it, too, can benefit greatly from some added ingredients. We recommend adding one egg for every pound of ground bison -- and flavoring it with just a touch of shallot and Worcestershire. Other flavorings would work well too, so experiment with your favorites.

Still, some critics pointed to a comment Handel, Komen's vice president for public policy, made on the social media site Twitter.
That suggests that, where bond markets give governments the choice, there is a legitimate debate to be had about timing of austerity. The IMF economic models suggest it will be five years before the "break-even" point when the benefits to growth of cutting debt start to exceed the "Keynesian" effects of austerity.
Before Biden’s visit, Kyrillos, a Republican state senator from Monmouth County, released a web video that attempted to tie Menendez and the vice president to former Gov. Jon Corzine, under whom the futures brokerage MF Global went bankrupt.
During one visit in February, Weathers said, he saw the children on their knees, hands clasped before them in prayer. Weathers didn’t get a long look, and robes covered their bodies, obscuring their stature.
The pediment pieces had been nailed together at some point. The conservators removed the old nails and, wherever possible, used the existing holes for the new screws used to reinforce the piece.

MetroHealth’s trustees agreed to buy the 10-acre lot at its monthly board meeting Wednesday evening. Officials of the taxpayer-subsidized health system announced last month that it would eliminate 450 jobs to cut $30 million from its budget. Money for the new health center will come from the $75 million MetroHealth raised in Build America Bonds, which must be used for construction and not day-to-day operations.
"Body of Lies" also does not have strong "definite interest," a sign of how many moviegoers are inclined to actually go out, buy tickets and see a specific film, and the film's early reviews have been pretty good but not glowing. Even though "Body of Lies" is not explicitly about the war in Iraq, recent movies with even a vague Middle Eastern story have labored to sell tickets. With the economy a shambles, audiences may want easy escapism over anything serious, a reason a new trailer for Adam Sandler's "Bedtime Stories" has been playing so well.

No expense was spared in planning and creating State of the Art Surgery Center: A world-renowned architect and designer was hired and asked to bring an elegant and sophisticated feel to the already modern building. The center has the most modern air-treatment device and wall coverings are done in Venetian plaster. Patients and visitors are greeted in a tastefully designed waiting room, which includes a 60-inch plasma television and a stellar view of Sunset Boulevard. The exam rooms are all equipped for pre-operative evaluation and small procedures. The operating rooms are equipped with the latest equipment for each specialty: plastic surgery, foot and ankle surgery, orthopedic surgery, pain management, G.I. procedures, internal medicine or urology.

Kapono, acquired Thursday in the trade with the Los Angeles Lakers will be waived, a league source said. The club plans to sign shooting guard Manny Harris for the remainder of the season.
Plastic surgery statistics are trickier to nail down on a local level. The plastic surgery association releases only broad regional statistics about specific procedures.

And yet others say that as less freshwater comes downstream from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and its tributaries, the bay holds a greater percentage of saltwater. Such a change could mean more cetacean prey species inside bay waters. According to Keener, at least one other larger marine mammal has been spotted inside bay waters: the California bottlenose dolphin.

And no one's in a position to argue after Tseng eclipsed the field in closing with a 6-under-66 for a 19-under 269 at Locust Hill Country Club outside of Rochester. She won by 10 strokes, and matched the LPGA record for lowest score in relation to par at a major that was set three previous times. Cristie Kerr shot 269 on this same course to win the LPGA Championship a year ago by 12 strokes, while Dottie Pepper (1999 Kraft Nabisco) and Karen Stupples (2004 Women's British Open) also finished at 19 under.

In my 16 years as a TV critic, I've rarely seen a season as obsessed as this one has been with sequels, remakes and reboots. ABC tried a new "Charlie’s Angels," and no one cared. NBC flopped with a remake of "Prime Suspect" and is in the process of flopping with a sequel to "The Firm." The jury’s still out on FOX’s eight-years-later animated version of "Napoleon Dynamite," but precedent’s not good.

Necker Island: Richard Branson's Caribbean retreat on Necker Island (www.neckerisland.com) went up in flames last summer. But be calm, billionaires. The island, in the British Virgin Islands east of Puerto Rico, is back in business as a getaway spot for the rich and famous. (Kate Winslet was among the guests when the Great House caught fire on Aug. 22; she was said to have helped Branson's 90-year-old mother to safety.) Though no serious injuries were reported, reconstruction will take awhile. To keep guests coming, the island's Bali Houses and Branson's private home, Temple House, have been refurbished. Travelers also can book the resort's 104-foot catamaran, Necker Belle.

By day, the 246-room hotel's interior is appointed with natural sunlight filtered through clear panels in the dome. This is the best time to appreciate the harmonic spacing of the Ionic columns that support the rotunda, count the windows and balconies between them, and admire the gold-leaf embellishments. Sculptures and reproduction furniture are arranged for conversation groups, where guests talk to one another in hushed tones. Sound carries surprisingly well in here.

Alabama Republican Robert Bentley, who holds a double-digit lead over his Democratic challenger, vows to create "an environment that is unwelcoming to illegal immigrants."

"It's just endless," Coleman said. "He's one of the best. He'll go down as one of the greatest. To have the opportunity to speak with him and work with him was excellent."
Also, the council hopes that keeping the density level relatively low will allow the city to use ecosystem services instead of traditional utility infrastructure. That means the city would develop programs that would use Damascus' many streams and other natural features instead of networks of pipes to treat water and sewage, keeping costs low for landowners.

Most strictly classical pianists would have pulled off the thornier passages with more finesse, but Hancock’s genius was to make the "Rhapsody," a jazz-inflected symphonic tone, into something actually resembling jazz, making detours of his own and taking every measure in the moment, particularly in the way he pulled tempos like taffy in solo passages. Vajda and the players followed keenly — no mean feat — with a measure of swing and sass you rarely hear from this orchestra.

Those of us who love Aardman will appreciate the gorgeous attention to detail, made sharper (not much sharper) by 3-D. But "Pirates" plays like a fussy film made by fussy little fussbudgets, clever chaps all wrapped up with making perfect Plasticine trees, but who lose track of the forest – the funny movie that is supposed to be animated around all this detail.

The lake, a 28-acre site tucked between Theodore Wirth Park and Cedar Lake, is encircled with mostly deciduous trees and dense green shrubbery. It offers a bit of nature not far from the bustle of downtown Minneapolis: Turtles sunbathe on rotted logs on its edge, wood ducks skim its surface, and the chirp of red-winged blackbirds carries over the distant hum of Interstate 394 traffic and the occasional train passing by on the east side tracks.
First is her adjustable-rate mortgage. Right now, the loan has an interest rate of 3.375 percent, and Melissa is quite happy about that. But her concern that the rate could increase in the years to come are valid.

This is politics and sorry, Mr. Fletcher, but you will be the enemy of anyone wanting the (pension) status quo to remain. This enemy is time-tested, highly savvy, backed by a lot of money and very powerful. Our city needs a very savvy and shrewd politician with knowledge of laws, economics, the environment and governmental affairs and has to possess the kind of political will that our city needs today to get the major problems solved during the next term, not four terms from how. Our next mayor needs to have solid and sound political experience, the kind you get working in a functional and healthy political system, not the kind you get in a system like we have at the state level in California. – Paul Jester, San Diego

A lot of teams bolt out the gate, but more than a few not only come back to the pack, but also fall woefully behind, too. Look no further than last year's Pittsburgh Pirates, who were in first place in the NL Central as late as the week after the All-Star break, but ultimately descended to a fourth-place 72-90 record. The Pirates were a classic example of how teams playing over their heads tend to treat a fast start like swimming in shark-infested waters. In the beginning, it's an exhilarating rush. In the end, it's a physical and emotionally draining downward spiral.
Dewey, who has served nearly 18 years of a life sentence in state prison, is expected to walk free today after a 3:30 p.m. court hearing.
So far, the lowest-cost Android tablet is a $400 Asus model.

Several companies have said their Android tablet sales were lower than expected.

Beware north winds and large waves this weekend. Western Lake Erie walleye fishing has been best, with good numbers of spawning fish caught from the shallow reef areas on lead-head jigs and off the reefs while trolling minnow-style plugs, as well as west of Catawba Island. The best areas for trolling have been deep water on the outside of the reefs off Camp Perry and the Davis-Besse power plant. Brisk west winds this week had slowed the fishing on top of the reefs, but Crib and Locust reefs could rebound today.

You can also sample the wares at the islands' first "meadery," or honey wine producer, Nani Moon Mead in Kapa'a. Founded by Stephanie "Nina" Krieger, the meadery turned two this year, and now produces five varieties using raw Hawaiian honey. Cacao Moon, made with macadamia nut blossom honey, organic Kauai cacao and vanilla, is nicknamed "the panty dropper" (ahem), according to the company's Web site, perhaps in part because it has the highest alcohol content (12 percent), compared to 11 for the Ginger Spice, Winter Sun and Pineapple Guava Sunset. Available only on Kauai, Laka's Nectar pairs mountain apple with honey and has 10 percent alcohol by volume.

The Kansas City Chiefs, who lost their director of college scouting in the middle of draft preparation when Phil Emery was hired as the Bears' general manager, made it five defensive picks out of the last six by taking 6-3, 246-pound nose tackle Dontari Poe of Memphis. Poe is a ‘‘workout warrior'' who literally and figuratively is one of the draft's biggest boom-or-bust players, but the Chiefs were working from strength. They were 11th in total defense last season but were tied for 27th in sacks with 29.

I finally leave to search for what I've heard is the only known flushing toilet of ancient Rome. When I first read about it, I didn't understand: Most Roman toilets had water running constantly beneath them. Isn't that flushing? Evidently, no.

Payments to anyone other than the receiver that arise from any claim against Beckman related to the Ponzi scheme will harm the receivership's estate, Zayed wrote.
The pitch reflects a challenge for Romney, one of the wealthiest candidates ever to run for president: He so far has been unable to build a broad base of small donors who can inject fresh cash into his campaign. The need to do so has grown more acute as he heads into next week's Super Tuesday, with contests in 10 states, and subsequent battles in the fight for the GOP nomination.

øCaroline Wozniacki will win a Grand Slam title. Blind belief can be a good thing, except when it leads one down the road of destruction … or leads to a really dangerous prediction. But we can't help this one. On the plus side, Wozniacki has ended the last two years as the No. 1 player in the world, and she's held the top ranking for 64 weeks total, including the last 46. She has a WTA-best 12 singles titles in the last two years. At her best she is a defensive whiz who makes opponents hit ball after ball until they make that inevitable error. And now, with the cons, let us take a flamethrower to those pros: Underwhelming performances against the top players, major disappointments in the Slams. That brings us back to blind belief. Wozniacki did tell Danish media she would emphasize winning a Slam title this year. And that's something new, frankly, because her standard line on that subject always has been, predictably, defensive: It will come when it comes, or something of the sort. It's a subtle change in outlook but an encouraging one. Don't misunderstand: We don't mean to diminish the importance of playing and winning many tournaments. At some point, however, No. 1 players in the world are expected to win the big ones. Fact of life.

Also, in the notebook, we've got a few details from the Yankees 7-3 loss to the Rangers. Once again, Phil Hughes looked awful. He didn't last through the third inning and was clearly frustrated about it. He should have been. The Rangers are a good-hitting lineup but Hughes was giving up rockets. Before you ask, Joe Girardi has already committed to leaving Hughes in the starting rotation. Not that he's got any viable alternatives at the moment.

Big numbers: The PGA Tour rarely, if ever, releases exact attendance figures, but a Tour spokesman said attendance at this year's Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone was up a whopping 48 percent over 2010. It can't all be attributed to the appearance of Tiger Woods -- he played last year -- or can it?
I understand the obsession with Savage. His fans are obsessed with his upside the way so many other colleges were when they recruited him. What I don't understand is why you'd want to risk the attitude in the locker room by having him come back. De'Antwan Williams desided to leave. Why didn't Schiano go after Williams and have him come back after Savon Huggins got hurt? How do you hold players accountable for their decisions if you are going to allow them to walk back on the team, whether they have to work for it or not? I think the risk of the morale of the locker room by having the player return is too much for a marginal potential gain over Gary Nova or Chas Dodd.

Joe Henry, a songwriter whose work has been performed by Frank Sinatra, John Denver and many others, has written his first novel in a style so spare and deep that it could almost be sung aloud by the reader. It is not so much a story, a narrative, as it is a ballad, an insight into the relationship between a father, his three sons, their mother, the horses they break and tend, and the place at the foot of the Wind River Mountains where they live, Lime Creek. Here is the father, a young man of 20, sent from his home in Wyoming to the unfamiliar East for college, walking three miles from a train station to ask the love of his life if she will marry him. Here are the three boys they raise making a fire to heat the water for their bath. Here they are learning to live with horses, learning about the cold, getting to know the land around their home. Here they are navigating the loss of their beautiful mother, remembering her hair and the way she talked to dogs. Here is their father, eating alone. With such lyrical writing, it is astonishing how little information we need to embrace the feeling of a family we will never forget.

At a news conference Monday in Newton, Mass., Frank cited the redrawn congressional map in Massachusetts as a factor in his decision to retire.
