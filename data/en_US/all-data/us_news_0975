A: My 13-year-old daughter does the same thing. This mostly happens after she visits her dad. He and I are divorced, and he just started dating. Once we noticed that she seemed to be very reserved around family members, teachers and friends upon returning from her weekends with her dad, yet exploding at home and school over trivial incidents, I called the school counselor and asked her to talk with my daughter. Basically the counselor said that my daughter still had high hopes of her dad and I getting back together and blamed herself for it not happening. Seeing her dad with a different woman destroyed this dream. It took several counseling sessions and the follow through to assure her that her dad and I were not recovering our relationship and that it had nothing to do with her. We both have tried very hard to make sure that she knows that we respect one another and love her very much. If you can't get the answers you need from your daughter about why she is doing this, have her talk to the school counselor or another professional who might help you figure out what is going on and what you can do to help her correct the problem. - Suzie Hampton in Pensacola, Fla.

In addition to be a 'numbers' person and enjoying the field, public accounting requires individuals with good social skills. In fact, with most firms, that's the first thing they want to see in a prospective employee because we're in an industry where we interact with people all the time. So, it's very important to know how to address and communicate with people from different educational backgrounds. Aside from performing and delivering quality work to our clients, they really value the personalized service we provide.

Granted, growing and selling drugs can be a lucrative career with exciting opportunities for advancement. But even if you assume (as I do) that some of the jobs would be new and many customers are legitimate patients with serious medical conditions, Oregon wouldn't exactly improve its business climate by opening a bunch of wink-nudge pharmacies.

You think it’s tough finding parking in Hoboken? Try downtown Paterson. Wiener ran in and picked up our pizzas at Broadway Pizza (56 Broadway, Paterson; 973-684-9407) as the Munchmobile driver held down a more-or-less legal parking spot nearby. It wasn’t worth the effort. The plain had a lackluster crust, and the sausage was subpar — and that’s being kind. The Sicilian, with little sauce and runny cheese, looked like it had been in an accident.
One rule specifically bans cheating, cheating devices or the use of electronics while playing.

Those who understand Nathan's positions, reflect on his record, and listen to his words know exactly what his move to the middle meant. The move was a reflection of the values he has consistently held and the progress he is hoping to make. Nathan has always been independent in his actions, regardless of party affiliation. He chose to weigh the value of every issue on its merit, rather than resort to party dogma and group think. It is never easy when one decides to think for themselves and risk upsetting the political establishment, but that's exactly why San Diego needs Nathan Fletcher as mayor. – Jason Pyle, Founder, Sapphire Energy, San Diego

The bane of his existence is his 90ish mother (Valeria de Franciscis Bendoni), deeply tanned no doubt from the many poker games she plays with her peers in the garden of her luxurious house. She has all the money. Gianni lives on a pension and his wife's income, and grits his teeth as his mother serves champagne to her poker buddies and buys designer gowns for her caregiver. His marriage is peaceful and his wife affectionate, but seems focused elsewhere.

Holzer's introduction is worth the price of admission: He allows his readers to sense the behind-the-scenes conversations that produced these remarkable first-person essays. The editors knew that the biggest general to catch was Grant. The general and ex-president turned away their opening overture, but with the failure of Grant & Ward on Wall Street in 1884, resulting in the loss of all of Grant's assets, he agreed to write an essay on Shiloh for $500. The present editors include four of Grant's Century essays. Reading them here allows us to understand why Grant's "Personal Memoirs," completed in 1885 as he was dying from throat cancer, became the surprising standard for all future presidential memoirs.

If the NFL ever eliminates the kickoff, a truly exciting play that represents the essence of the sport, it will have gone too far on the safety issue. Otherwise, every new rule gets hearty applause from here. In the face of current and imminent lawsuits, rumored to be in the thousands, the NFL will do everything in its power to reduce and monitor concussions, including a program that would keep track of every retired player, many of them too proud to take measures on their own or admit to any brand of vulnerability.

They also caught sight of Niese, a slinky lefty, a sophomore throwing fastballs in the mid-80s.

Giving individuals the same tax breaks for health insurance that corporations get, allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, a modicum of tort reform and the expansion of health savings accounts would have done a great deal to improve quality and reduce costs.

They put guests' kids (ages 2 to 12) in the hands of qualified professionals for daily hosted morning and afternoon sessions, plus evening sessions on Friday and Saturday nights.

And when it's time for the family to come together, programming like jellyfish feeding, soccer shootout competitions, and beach sports provide fun for all ages.
North Carolina's sloppiness — 13 turnovers in the first half — was uncharacteristic. Then again, the Tar Heels were without their quarterback. Stilman White, a fuzzy-cheeked North Carolina freshman guard who might be mistaken for a team manager, turned in a credible effort in trying to fill the sneakers of Tar Heels standout point guard Kendall Marshall.

The recent discussions between the company and Feinberg illustrate how politically sensitive the bonuses have become, both for AIG and for the Obama administration. No development in the government's bailout of financial firms has angered lawmakers and ordinary Americans more than the disclosure in mid-March that the global insurer was paying more than $165 million in retention bonuses. Those were aimed at retaining 400 employees at AIG Financial Products, the troubled unit whose complex derivative contracts nearly wrecked the global insurance giant.

The paper by the scholars from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College is detailed and runs through several scenarios. I want to highlight what I thought was an especially telling set of numbers. For the median wage earner -- and assuming a rate of return on assets of 4 percent in their 401(k) and IRA -- starting to save at age 25 rather than age 45 cuts the required savings rate for an adequate retirement income by about two-thirds. However, delaying retirement from age 62 to age 70 also reduces the required savings rate by some two-thirds.

Donald Warnke, Stevensville: Nov. 10, 1963. Anyone over 10 years old will remember the date. I was in history class at Denby High School.

It was more than just Public League vs. Catholic League. Both schools were undefeated, both Class A. The winner would be voted in as the state champs of Michigan.

It certainly would not be fair to the hospitals that might want to present a countervailing message to a hypothetical CNA initiative to mandate patient-to-nurse ratios. It certainly would not be fair to insurance companies or doctors' groups that might want to present their side to an attempt by the CNA to ask voters to approve a government-run health-care system -- which, some suspect, is the hidden agenda of Proposition 89.

Pambazos, spongy potato-and-chorizo sandwiches whose chile-dipped slabs of bread are charred on the grill, still reign, but there's now a whole cast of tortas. Try the torta milanesa.

Burritos and tacos are present too.

The same could be said for the bean course that followed the opening course of Wagyu beef cured with pine needles from the Meadowood property and sliced paper-thin.

Any very good new show has its own big shoes to fill as it continues its first season. Good shows have to stay good, which means they have to be inventive week after week. By the same token, their creators are often afraid of straying too far from what made them good in the first place, which can find the show treading comedic water all too soon.

The more pertinent fact: Luck and RGIII are gone. Tannehill is overpriced. Weeden's age, if anything, deflates his value and that could work in the Browns' favor.

The legislation was stopped Wednesday -- but barely. To pass, the amendment needed 60 votes; only 54 senators voted for it.

And it's not looking as if we can count on our elected officials to keep them honest.
