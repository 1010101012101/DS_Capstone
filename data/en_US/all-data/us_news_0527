A logo is like a haircut: An updated style is a nod to changing times, even as the person underneath it remains the same. That's the subtle evolution the Timbers are going for. Most fans understand the leap to the majors deserves a new logo, but some have reservations, Eaton of the fan site said.
* Seeing Michael Cole in a Team Laurinaitis shirt had me worried he'd be announcing himself as the sixth member of the team at WrestleMania. Fortunately he simply announced himself as the team's official commentator. Wait, maybe that's not much better, after all...
"Once the work was done, awesome. It looks great," Evans said. "But during the construction, it came really close to putting me out of business. The contractor was blocking our entrance all the time. I'm hoping the Baseline project doesn't do the same thing."
The City Council hasn't taken any votes on the project yet. Tiffany Pruit, a city council member who opposes the casino, said she wants to be cautious about the Nestle proposal.
"We were aware of him going into the series," Quenneville said of the former Hawk. "He's a dangerous player and ... he's one of those guys in tight areas that gets his shot away so we want to make sure we're hard on him."
“We’ll expand the partnership as more ideas unfold and more students express interest,” said Lavender. “By the time students in this program are seniors, they can take the ‘early release’ option and take their classes at GCC.”
Practicing with Ji, Fairbanks developed a more melodious tone, closer to his own way of speaking, and, he felt, equally true for the character who had robbed a Texaco station, shot the cashier and was letting a "colored man" take the fall.
McLaughlin's arrest in September came just as the Cardinals were completing their miraculous comeback from a 10½-game deficit in late August to make the playoffs, and happened after he had his last Cards broadcasting assignment of the season. His stint in rehab coincided with the playoffs, then the World Series games were played at night, when he was attending meetings related to his sobriety. So he said he saw little of the team's momentous run to the championship. So the guy who had the most Cardinals play-by-play assignments on TV this season rarely watched their postseason action live.
We're expanding to about eight new cities, and Portland's one of them. The question for Portland is really going to be, 'how does our development coincide with the Apple store that's in development as well.' (The Yard House will open in part of the former Saks Fifth Avenue in the Pioneer Place Mall.)
Paved roads, telephones and outside electricity didn't arrive until the 1940s. James Copley, the late publisher of the San Diego Union-Tribune and one of Borrego's key boosters, took over the town's first hotel in 1960, renamed it the Casa del Zorro and built it into a 42-acre oasis of private villas and formal service.

The audience at the NFL draft on Thursday night filled Radio City Music Hall with chants of "R-G-three," referring to the No. 2 pick, while top choice Andrew Luck and his family still occupied the stage.
Fortunately, a lovely human at our branch was happy to help me; unfortunately, branch managers have no authority; they dialed me back into the alien-speak help number. I was told an inquiry into my missing check would be launched. A case number was assigned. So happy, I went home. Two weeks later, I called the intergalactic 800 number for a progress update. What? No case number? No record of my three phone calls?
"We're reaching out to local businesses and have plans for a delivery service to the downtown area," he said. "We'll do some Supper Club-level dinners, maybe on Thursday nights when there's live music."
Food you hate? Capers. Woof.
The topic of the story in The Star had nothing to do with children or crime. And this man was actually a rather minor part of the coverage overall, mentioned in four paragraphs at the beginning with one innocuous quote, as an example of an individual affected by the broader subject matter the story addressed. His photo was the story's lead image, though.
Roused to action by this declaration, detectives looked around for likely suspects, saw one in the infant's very large father, and turned the situation into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Armed with the zeal of the righteous, they believed nothing would do unless Thomas could be made to confess in exactly the way they thought he should. Which is what eventually happened.
"There is a real irony that super PAC ads destroyed Gingrich's campaign and revived it," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which oversees FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan project that ferrets out untruths in campaign advertising.
Advocates of some middle ground envisage limiting access to floating viewing platforms, interpretive displays, even waterfront interactive art.
Edwards said he will probably attend fewer meetings and that he plans to devote more of his time to such things as completion of the Chuck Berry Statue project, which is anticipated for a May 2011 installation, and work on the Loop Trolley system, which is expected to break ground in late 2011 with electric trolleys operating by late 2012.
Stocks had their first positive week in a month the week ended Aug. 26 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. remains on pace for long-term economic growth. The Dow has risen for seven of the last eight days.
After hours of resident testimony against the $9 million project at Proposed and Pennsylvania Avenues, plus three planning board sessions that went well into the night, the board approved the electric company's preliminary site plan — but only under certain conditions.

Government reports following the 2010 Census emphasized that the growth in the U.S. white population was largely due to increases within the Hispanic population  because a majority of Latinos also identified as white racially. But many also checked other for race, likely a nod to the desire to be considered a distinct group.
Jim Nowlan, senior fellow at the University of Illinois Institute of Government and Public Affairs, calls Kirk "the quintessential moderate in the framework of Chuck Percy," the late U.S. senator whose centrist-Republican politics has typified the Illinois GOP for years.

King Kamehameha's story begins (and ends) on the island of Hawai'i, where several prophesies foretold the coming of a great ruler. One was that a light in the sky with feathers like a bird would herald his birth — leading historians to theorize that Kamehameha was born in 1758, when Halley's Comet crossed Hawaiian skies. The locale, if not the date, is fairly certain: Kohala Historical Sites State Monument, off a rugged dirt road near the 'Upolu Airport, boasts a sign and rock marking the birthplace (or 'āina hanau) of "Kamehameha Akahi." It's also home to the eerie Mo'okini Heiau, the largest temple ever built in Hawai'i, a place of human sacrifice built centuries before with stones passed hand to hand from Pololū Valley 14 miles away. (Both sites should be treated with utmost respect — no climbing on walls or removing rocks.)
"It's why you come back. And this was a perfect spot," Giambi said. "Sure, they could walk me, but CarGo (Carlos Gonzalez) is so hot and he's on deck."
Rather, the U.S. must focus on ways to make college more affordable in the future. Part of the solution would be to adequately invest in public schools. In Maryland, a half-decade-long freeze on in-state tuition rates helped make the state's public universities more affordable when compared to their peers in other states. The difference in cost was made up by public funds.
And what about General Sherman you might ask? There is not nearly enough of him, though actor Harry Groener commands the stage in every scene in which he DOES appear as this volatile, tormented, sardonic man with little patience for politicians, and immense pain over the death of a son.

Sharlotte Hydorn, the East County woman who sold mail-order "suicide kits" out of her house until last year, is scheduled to face a federal judge Thursday.
Another mitigating factor might simply be cost. At the moment, no one knows exactly how much the Panama Canal Authority will charge for a right of passage through its new locks. Higher than anticipated fees, coupled with the inventory costs of the additional days that cargos are at sea  not to mention rising fuel prices  could make the generally faster intermodal routes through California's ports a relative bargain for many cost-conscious importers.
That's why it's a great play. That's also why it's about seven hours long, spread across two long, rich nights.
Workbook-like, "Children's Picturebooks" is a kind of catalog of short essays on varied topics, 300 color illustrations and "case studies" (mini-interviews with professionals and would-be artists). Here is a history of the genre from the classics to rule-breaking contemporary offerings, as well as mention of the widening audience for visual literature as teens devour graphic novels and adults honor wordless masterpieces like "The Arrival" by Shaun Tan. Here, too, are intellectual discussions of picture-book techniques (largely borrowed from La Jolla-based critic Carole Scott): how, for example, pictures or words can be used to fill gaps the other leaves and how they can duel with each other.
The Detroit native, a former IBM programmer, does not have an IBM personality. He's a happy guy, except when it comes to his birthday.

Hellfire – Lots of long and boring black hallways through the ship's hull with hardly any scares. The lamest maze of the night was saved only by the coolest effect of the evening: the elevated walkway five stories above the "engine room." I won't give away the surprise. (Midship of the Queen Mary)

Terri Cerda did not attend the most recent hearing.
Before we'd even ordered drinks, the waitress plopped down a paper tray of deep-fried dough dusted in powdered sugar. When I said the corn fritters seemed more like dessert, she said, "You're in the South now, hon." We downed the golden nuggets with Yuengling amber lagers while waiting for our shrimp platters, but still had room for apple cobbler and ice cream. (It's the South, hon.)

Of course, all this is important only if Villaraigosa leaves office early to do something else, and he has said he won’t. And unless I’m forgetting something, he hasn’t left office early before to go do something else, especially after promising he wouldn’t. So never mind.

The Lakers appeared to be in control of the series after a narrow victory in Game 4 last weekend, but the Nuggets rallied for two straight dominant victories.

tant, you'd be better served expending more mental energy on the middle rounds, where championship fantasy rosters are built. After all, while it's interesting to debate whether Foster merits a top-three pick this year, many of those who stole him in the fifth round or later last year rode him all the way to a fantasy title.

However, by measuring fatigue levels and providing data on a player's training over a period of time, coaches can better determine when to dial back a workout, allowing for more rest and potentially reducing the risk of injury or other health issues.
Many of the undead are part of familiar chains that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year: Friendly's, Chevys, Sbarro, Perkins. The zombie restaurants, barely bringing in enough cash to cover basic expenses, always seem to be one sizzling fajita or glazed chicken skewer away from a merciful end, but somehow keep hanging on  leaving too many restaurants chasing after scarce dining dollars.

For some years, Jolly Pumpkin has been scouting around on the wilder edges of the Belgian ale repertoire without being curmudgeonly about it. When it makes a sour ale, it's always an attractive one.

The initiative is a remake of so-called "paycheck protection" measures rejected by voters in 1998 and 2005. While those propositions were direct attacks on labor's political fundraising, the new version tries to be clever, purporting to restrict corporate money as well. In fact, it would gut only one side's ability to play in politics  organized labor.

In another complication, it is expected that new legislation would also seek to impose civilian national service on Israel's 1.5 million Arab citizens. That would almost surely antagonize the Arab sector on which Israel's dovish opposition depends for any chance of a majority. Their current exemption is a double-edged sword, reflecting de facto segregation and a state reluctant to test their loyalty.

In this situation, someone has to take charge. For Damon, it was his father, tireless, loving guardian of the family's well-being and fierce watchdog over his brilliant, ailing son. Damon's mother was just as deeply connected to her son and to all their children, but in the ongoing struggle that was Damon's medical condition, Doron was the project manager, guiding an incomparably important effort that was elusive, ever-shifting, and never entirely in his hands. Like a determined and lonely warrior, the author writes of his personal quest, "I scour the earth in search of a cure for Damon."

During the 1930s in New Jersey, baseball was king. Coached by their father, the 12 Accera boys fielded their own team. Interrupted by WWII, they played semipro ball for decades, the longest all-brothers team in baseball history -- "no jealousy, no rivalry, no fighting." They drew large crowds. Striking black crayon, gouache and watercolor paintings enhanced with digital color provide a solid backup to the tightly written narrative. A very pleasing slice of American history. P.S.

doesn't throw as hard as Boggs, Sanchez and Motte but he has so far proven unflappable in the role. (Warning: small sample size.) Dave Duncan remains an avowed Boggs backer but for now believes Salas represents the hot hand. Salas said earlier this year that he approaches the ninth inning as if it were the sixth. He apparently has the underrated ability to look at each situation with the same degree of calm. For whatever reason, Sanchez' command and velocity eroded in the ninth inning. Boggs hasn't regained the ground he lost when he dropped an April 26 save in Houston. Dunc' seems to have slotted Motte as the bullpen firestopper to be dropped into a mess in order to get a strikeout. Salas led the Texas League in saves in 2008, dealt with thumb and shoulder issues in 2009 and re-emerged in the closer role at Memphis last season. He's

To be sure, some spending reflects the effects of the recession. But most doesn't. As Haskins shows, spending on the poor has increased steadily for decades. Consider food stamps. There are now about 45 million Americans receiving an average of $287 a month in food stamps, up from 26 million in 2007, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report. But the number in 2007, when the economy was healthy, was roughly 50 percent higher than in 2001.

"I think we moved our legs pretty well since the second period," said Flyers winger Jakub Voracek, who had two assists in the victory. "We made them play with the puck more often. We put the pressure on them. They made a few turnovers which led to some goals."
Given how packed Mitford's life was, the tone shift makes practical sense. Consider the people she crossed paths with: Alan Lomax, Josephine Baker, Nora Ephron, Huddie "Lead Belly" Ledbetter, William Faulkner, Maya Angelou, Tom Hayden, J.R.R. Tolkien, Katharine Graham, Jean Genet. And that's the short list. There's much ground to cover, and Brody squeezes a lot in: hobnobbing with New Deal power mongers; Romilly's death while flying an air raid over Germany and Jessica's subsequent grief; her work in the federal Office of Price Administration, where she meets labor lawyer Robert Treuhaft and does some of her first undercover work; reconciliations with her sisters; her move to Oakland and marriage to Treuhaft; joining the Communist Party, emerging as a doyenne of progressive politics and rollicking parties; and, of course, the investigative juggernaut that struck fear into morticians all over the country.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — An Ohio lawmaker said he plans to introduce "Caylee's Law," a measure that would make it a felony for parents to fail to report the passing of their child within one hour of death or report a child missing within 24 hours of their disappearance.

Perhaps best of all is her banchan of kkakdugi — spicy cubes of pickled daikon. This dish is so important to Lee that the restaurant's full Korean name roughly translates to "Mapo House of Pickled Daikon." She uses her mother's marinade recipe, which, she says, is the secret. The kkakdugi she makes is extraordinary — a mild pickled radish flavor with a zippy, Champagne-like effervescence. It's a little sweet, a lot crunchy and, if you want more, all you have to do is ask.
Art: Long before the Spanish arrived, Puebla was an Indian pottery-making center, and the natives happily incorporated designs and techniques — believed to have originated in Talavera de la Reina, Spain — brought by the padres. Production of Talavera pottery reached its height in the late 17th century; originally blue and white, it took on green, orange and yellow hues in the 18th century. Even a short stroll through the city presents a crazy quilt of patterned tiles on ledges, domes, fountains, churches and hotels. You can watch the process on weekdays at Uriarte International in Puebla's historic center.

At Okolemaluna, owners (and former Bay Area residents) Brice and Lisa Ginardi used green remodeling practices before the business opened in late 2010, either reusing or donating items removed during demolition, and installing sustainable bamboo, vintage and locally sourced decor, and energy-efficient fixtures and appliances. Brice Ginardi's popular drink menu, which recreates classic tiki cocktails, also eschews corn syrup and artificial flavorings for organic cane sugar, island fruits and herbs, and homemade syrups; for more local flavor, try the exotic Okolehao ti root liqueur.
In 1950, against all serious advice, Douglas decided to run for the U.S. Senate against a rising young GOP congressman with a ferocious taste for red-baiting. Nixon and his political mentor, Murray Chotiner, turned the campaign into a virtual compendium of dirty tricks, stirring up not only unfounded apprehensions about Douglas' loyalties but also anti-Semitism because her husband was Jewish.

After playing four games last week, the Blazers get just two this week, and some of them could sure use the lighter workload.
That civil discourse may be on life support is not news to anyone paying attention to political rhetoric. Part of this has to do with fundraising, which mostly relies on negatives, not positives, because as a fundraiser once told me, you can't raise money on a positive. Part of it is also ratings. In an uncertain world, people like to tune in to programs -- liberal and conservative -- that reinforce views they already hold.

"There is a lot of discussion about what the aging of the baby boom should mean for spending on Social Security and Medicare.

“Bully” is a film every parent and child in America should see. It will make even bullies weep. We follow such children as Alex Hopkins, a sweet, middle school boy from Sioux City, Iowa, nicknamed “Fish Face,” who’s being relentlessly bullied and tries his best to suck it up and endure it. The bullying itself takes the form of name--calling, physical attacks, verbal threats and other forms of psychological abuse. We also meet the parents of Tyler, a 17-year-old who killed himself when, as his grief-stricken, anti--bullying crusader father puts it, “Enough was enough.” Who is not going to relate to this movie?

Is it the supporting players in "The Social Network" or "Black Swan"? Is it the star of "The Fighter," who produced the film and saw three of his co-stars get tapped? Is it the director of the box-office smash "Inception," whose previous snub, for "The Dark Knight," inspired the Academy to expand the pool of best-picture nominees to 10?

The top income tax rate is 35 percent, so how can people who make so much pay so little in taxes? The nation's tax laws are packed with breaks for people at every income level.

Republicans control the House, 242-190 with three vacancies that were Democratically held seats. Democrats would need a net gain of 25—plus hold on the three vacant seats—to retake control.

Vanderbilt was dealt a blow in late October when All-SEC center Festus Ezeli sprained his knee, forcing him to the sideline for six to eight weeks. That should make it easier for Ducks senior Jeremy Jacob, who was hampered by injuries throughout last season, to do work in the paint.
Landing this particular All-Star Game is a major victory in the continued revitalization of our metropolitan area. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park, arguably the most famous ballpark in the world. Many on the outside thought that Boston would be the inevitable choice for this year's game. The selection of Kansas City confirms what we already knew. This community can attract and host the most premier events in the world because we are a first-class city.

By reversing his prior orders on jury selection, he effectively acknowledged his mistake -- a wakeup call to other judges who might seek to short-circuit public access while a jury is being seated.
Hey, Doug: Luck is the best quarterback in the draft. Griffin had a scintillating year at Baylor, but nine NFL GMs out of 10 would take Luck over him -- I believe. How good is Luck? Peyton Manning is a fair comparison.
Hot Chelle Rae's name might recall a female mud-wrestling undercard or an adult film star, but the four fellas that make up the band put that idea to rest with the first bars of each of the 11 songs on their sophomore album, "Whatever."

5, 2012 - the day Eli Manning surpassed his big brother, cemented Tom Coughlin's legacy and damaged Tom Brady's and Bill Belichick's reputations with another scintillating, fourth-quarter touchdown drive - is still fresh in our minds. And it just might be another four decades before we see an NFL game as significant as the Giants' 21-17 victory over the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. The victory Eli Manning engineered inside The House Peyton Built could dramatically change, for the worse, the narrative on three of the biggest names in all of sports (Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick)."

• Carmelo Anthony can only do so much. If the Knicks are going to come back against the heavily favored Heat, they'll need more 3-pointers from Steve Novak and J.R. Smith, wrote George Willis of the New York Post: "Smith has led the Knicks reserves in scoring, totaling 30 points in the two playoff games, not a bad effort considering part of his duties has included guarding LeBron James... But Novak has been silenced by the Heat defense, scoring six points in Game 1 and just three points in Game 2. Overall, Novak has taken just five shots in the two games, making three, all from 3-point range, this after averaging six shots per game during the regular season."

Last week, we learned that farm income in 2011 is forecast to reach an all-time high, up 28 percent over 2010, signaling that American agriculture remains a bright spot in our nation's economy. The growth in farm income is also making a real difference for America's farm families, whose household income was up 3.1 percent in 2010 and is forecast to increase 1.2 percent in 2011. And despite marginal increases in retail food prices, all American families still pay substantially less for food at the grocery store than residents of nearly every other country thanks to the productivity of our farmers. All told, this is good news for our national economy.

“He was definitely the difference in the game tonight,” Oregon coach Dana Altman said of Joseph. “He doesn’t take many bad shots for us, and you’ve gotta give a guy like that a little freedom because he’s got such a good feel for the game. I’m not surprised (at his play) at all; I knew he was a good player. When he gets a little stronger, he’s really going to be a handful.”

Wallace was the first man hired when late CBS news producer Don Hewitt put together the staff of "60 Minutes" at its inception in 1968. The show wasn't a hit at first, but it worked its way up to the top 10 in the 1977-78 season and remained there, season after season, with Wallace as one of its mainstays. Among other things, it proved there could be big profits in TV journalism.

But the initiative has been the object of some debate. The FTC's 2008 report noted that the CFBAI companies' nutritional standards, as well as their definitions of advertising directed at children, vary. Also, each company developed its own standards for "better-for-you" foods or a "healthy dietary choice." In addition, the FTC criticized the program for applying these standards only to some forms of advertising.

"It depends where the defender is," Schwaab said of the move. "You can go either way, so it's kind of like an improvisation once you do it, and then everybody else knows where to go. So, when they clear out it opens up for me really nice."
To do that, the system will have to be a little smaller, much tougher and able to take the shock of air drops, bumping around in a truck or jeep and keep operating below zero, at 115 degrees in the shade or in a sandstorm, said Sinsabaugh.

In my segment on the "O'Reilly Factor," I suggested that saying the president was accusing the right of waging a "war on women" was no different than Republican candidates accusing Obama of waging a "war on religion." This apparently did not sit well with some viewers, a number of whom called and emailed me after the show. One of the first emails was from a man whose comments were laced with so many vulgarities that I cannot repeat them here. Another vile attack went on to say, "what Rush Limbaugh called Fluke is mild compared to what you should be called. I hope you burn to death in a car fire. I have really come to hate bastards like you." I said on the show that there certainly is a perception that conservatives are conducting a "war on women." After these messages and calls, I am convinced. Columnist Michelle Malkin also says there's a war ... but she says it's conservative women who are the targets (Toronto Sun):
"I'm going to play it cool for now," center Mike Brewster said with a grin, "but Saturday will be here soon enough. Coach Fick said we're going to let our play do the talking and we're going to have to step up and do that."
5. The 2012 schedule: I'm not one to base a season's hopes on its schedule of games. But it's unavoidable to look at the 2012 slate and not consider it a positive. The six division games are a gantlet, of course. But of the remaining 10, only two are against playoff teams this season -- Denver (8-8) and the Giants (9-7). The remaining games are Kansas City (7-9), San Diego (8-8), Buffalo (6-10), Philadelphia (8-8), Washington (5-11), Oakland (8-8), Indianapolis (2-14) and Dallas (8-8). Yes, the makeups of each team will change. But that's a fairly weak schedule heading into the off-season.
The bombs were discovered on cargo planes on Friday and defused, one in Dubai and the other in East Midlands, United Kingdom. Both packages were addressed to Jewish organizations in Chicago, though officials believe they were intended to be detonated before arriving.

The photographs were among 18 provided to The Times by a soldier who said he hoped that publication would call attention to what he described as a lack of discipline and leadership in the unit that he felt had compromised soldiers' safety.
These aren't hard-and-fast rules, however. Parents: Watch for individual signs of fatigue, grumpiness, depression and a fall-off in academic performance. One trap for teens: The weekend, stay-up-late, sleep-late cycle. On early-to-rise Mondays, they can't snap back into a school day's routine. The result: They sag. You nag. Grades lag. What a drag. For bright-eyed mornings and solid snoozes, feed them a diet with omega-3-rich foods (avocado, walnuts, canola oil, fish oils), 100 percent whole grains, very little saturated fat and lots of veggies; help them get plenty of physical exercise (X the Xbox); and encourage them to spend face-to-face time with friends. They'll sleep like a baby (although not for as long) and so will you, at any age.
Amendments to add money for a program combating domestic violence and restoring a cut to grants to local police departments passed the House easily Tuesday evening, reflecting the political appeal of such programs.

Once upon a time, your only choice for dinner would have been the revered Columbia Restaurant, with its flamenco dancers, stately waiters and, uh, leisurely pace. Now, if you don't want to spend an entire evening dining (even if it is an amazing experience), you have far more options to enjoy a good meal. For quick, filling and delicious Cuban food, you can't go wrong with Carmine's. For delicious upscale Italian, book a reservation at Bernini and revel in its unique location in an old bank building (that also once served as home to a retro antique store). More Italian? La Terrazza Ristorante is an upscale retreat from the street. Acropolis offers Greek dining, while over at the Tampa Bay Brewing Co. in Centro Ybor, you can count on great bar food (their beer-dipped onion rings are awesome)and sample its locally brewed beer. Across the street is Samurai Blue, an upscale restaurant with 30-foot ceilings and killer sushi. Those too busy? Try Fresh Mouth or Centro Cantina in the complex, or find the Spaghetti Warehouse, an Ybor survivor of the early days that is housed in a small shopping complex called Ybor Square (whose distinct red neon sign is visible from the interstate). If you need late-night filler after a night of partying, don't miss Mema's Alaska Tacos, which serves its trademark dish early into the next morning. New York, New York, which serves piping hot pizza at late hours, is great to satiate that post-club hunger on the way back to your vehicle.

The rise in lay conservative fervor comes at a time when the need for activism would seem less urgent.

That is a remarkable three-year stretch of goaltending by Thomas and Rask. But once professional players establish their standard, if they fail to stay at that level, they have to be judged somewhat negatively.
Look, the final chapters of the Hendry story as Cubs GM were ugly, no doubt. But they would have been ugly no matter who the GM was. It was a no-win job, from the Tribune Co. signing big-name players to ridiculous contracts on Hendry's watch to the Ricketts family taking over and bumping into walls as they grew into big-boy owners. Add Crane Kenney buzzing around the offices in his clown car, and Hendry's days were numbered after the Cubs fizzled in the 2008 postseason.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The countdown hours leading to Derby Week tip-toed in with all the subtlety of a falling safe. On Saturday night, all hell broke loose in the skies above that slice of manufactured nationalism the locals call Kentuckyana. The sirens wailed in places where there were sirens.
"We could've made the tournament, but we made the NIT, which is a great tournament — but we came up short," Theodore said. "But just to look back on the whole season, me and Pope worked on our games a ton over the summer and we got better and were able to showcase our talent. And then the young guys. Really, coming into the season, nobody expected me and Herb to really do anything. I think we came a long way and I think we showed that Seton Hall is back."

Beijing city officials said Friday that microblogging sites that are based in the city must verify the real names of users before those users are allowed to post, though they can choose their own screen names. "If you want to post" information online, "you have to take responsibility," said Wang Hui, spokeswoman for the Beijing municipal government, adding that the ability to use screen names still will allow users to have some privacy. Though the new rules are limited to Beijing for now, the expectation is that they will be extended elsewhere.

When the lockout ended in December, Blazers athletic trainer Jay Jensen was on Przybilla's doorstep in Milwaukee within the first hour the NBA allowed.

What was happening in the marketplace at the same time was that corn subsidies, which began in the 1970s, increased the supply of corn, while lowering its price. Tariffs and quotas imposed on sugar in the late 1970s drove up the cost of that product. Food manufacturers began switching from the higher-priced sugar to lower-cost HFCS.

Riesling and Gewurztraminer: I'm skeptical of half-sweet renditions for Thanksgiving; they seem noncommittal. Truly sweet Rieslings should cut through the meal's weight, while dry ones add a steely edge to the round contours of holiday flavors. Gewurztraminer, meantime, really should be in dry form. Its typical ginger and spice really do match the season's flavors perfectly. (If you like onions in your stuffing, this is your perfect option.)

Magic Johnson is the face of the group selected to purchase the Los Angeles Dodgers. The $2.15 billion bid submitted by Guggenheim Partners not only leveled the competition but stands to change the landscape at the highest levels of all major American sports.

"Oh, I think so," he said. "You look at his numbers in the fourth quarter. LeBron's numbers are great. But the thing I like more is he's influencing the game in more ways.

Bley knows a little about preaching. She grew up in East Oakland, just a few blocks from where the Oakland-Alameda Country Coliseum and Oracle Arena stand today. Her father was a piano teacher, and she started playing piano when she was three or four years old. Performing came quickly. "I was a professional," she recalled with a laugh.

And that was not my own idea; that was my parents' idea. I was like a little monkey."

Thursday's outcome represented both an end to Pujols' prolific career with the Cardinals and a relationship with management that had soured eroded over the past two years.

In fact, the Cardinals restarted talks with a shorter term before incrementally reaching a 10-year structure.

But Weinstein and MPAA chairman Christopher Dodd also crafted a solution that essentially allowed both sides to claim victory.

The White House and women's groups argued that the mandate had nothing to do with the First Amendment. It was, they said, about improving women's health.

"In the days and months ahead, we should ask ourselves some very fundamental questions about who we are as a nation and who we are becoming. What does it mean to be an American in 2012?

Part of the D.R.’s appeal is that it is less pricey than other Caribbean islands. There are parts of Bayahibe that are still unpaved; street vendors hawk necklaces and earrings for a dollar or two apiece (nicer items might go for $5), and one resident told me that four or five years ago, her part of town did not even have electricity.

Oddly enough, these days, probably the hardest place to find a real saving is on airfare. The fare comparison sites have become so comprehensive and ubiquitous that you seldom see a better deal than what you find on the airlines' own systems or places like Kayak. The main exception to this rule is on business-class tickets, where discounters can still often undercut published fares. Keep in mind, however, that if you pay $3,000 for a $5,000 business-class ticket, you "save" $2,000 only if you'd really buy the $5,000 ticket absent a discount. If, instead, without the discount you'd fly premium economy, at $2,000, that business-class ticket didn't "save" you $2,000, it cost you an extra $1,000. And that's the true difference between a "saving" and a good price. Remember that.
Most people are aware that illegal drug use is a scourge on society and is destructive to the addict and his or her family. Nevertheless, you do not combat the meth problem by punishing law-abiding citizens. As a police officer with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, I made numerous arrests, including for drug violations. The way to combat the drug problem is to go after the drug dealers and producers. There are laws on the books that should be strenuously enforced.

In 10 starts, he went 1-7 with a 9.84 ERA and a 2.02 WHIP.
Congress generally takes up farm bills every five years. The current bill expires Sept. 30, and Congress expects to recess in early August.

What a gift from our government on Veterans Day, and I am a veteran. Can you believe the morning paper? The federal government wants to cut trillions from the budget. Work until age 68. Pay more for Medicare. Cut Social Security benefits. New taxes. Can't deduct certain taxes. Now you talk about a revolt? I'll lead the pack, just like they do in other states. Do you hear from your congressman or your senate man, "I'll take a pension cut or expense accounts"? No, you never hear that. Now Blunt, what are you going to do? Oh yeah, nothing, like before.

The smelter has churned out lead in Herculaneum, about 30 miles south of St. Louis, for more than 100 years. It is the last U.S. lead smelter. In recent decades, as the dangers of lead became clearer and environmental regulations were enforced, the smelter has come under greater scrutiny. Doe Run Resources Corp., which took over from Fluor in 1994, has said it will shut down the smelter in 2013. It plans to build a new, more advanced smelter nearby.

This year, there are signs that Southwest continued that strong financial trend.
His ruse was undone last spring, when the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service ran the identifications of dead Americans with a database of new passport applications.

There were those who thought John McCain might benefit from this, since he wrapped up the GOP nomination early, but, in fact, all the attention on the Democrats probably did him no good.

Co-headlined by Canada and Jennings, The Magical Misdemeanor Tour served as a forum for musicians who position themselves as authentic alternatives to the country music establishment. Both men are at pivotal junctures in their frustratingly erratic careers. Canada's previous band, Cross Canadian Ragweed, disbanded just as it was on the verge of achieving widespread popularity. The band was at the vanguard of the red dirt country movement, a spirited and unprocessed genre that originated in Oklahoma.
Dwyane Wade scored 25 points and Chris Bosh 21, and the Heat beat New York, 104-94, on Monday night, sending the Knicks to an NBA-record-tying 12th straight postseason loss.
As things have played out there, the supposed independence of the super PACs has actually worked in the candidates' favor rather than against them. Mr. Gingrich has disavowed many of the attacks in a super PAC-funded, Michael Moore-style video polemic against Mr. Romney's activities at his former investment firm, Bain Capital — and has urged Mr. Romney to do the same about attacks from his own super PAC allies. But the documentary, "When Mitt Romney Came to Town," is still up on the group's website, and Winning our Future has just bought another $1.8 million of airtime in South Carolina for new attacks, largely thanks to a $5 million check from a Nevada casino magnate who has long supported Mr. Gingrich.

Ask the Broncos and they’ll tell you their expectations are nothing short of winning the Super Bowl. (Of course, the Browns would tell you the same thing.) But realistically, providing Peyton Manning is throwing the ball as advertised, Denver is perfectly capable of going deep into the playoffs and more. With a talented young defense that at times was exceptional last season, an offensive line that’s a good blend of youth and experience, and a future Hall of Famer at quarterback, the Broncos will be imposing in a lukewarm division.
"We have girls who can shoot and score really well and work off of each other," Nerinx Hall Coach Jody Patterson said. "When they play as a team and communicate on the field, they're unstoppable on defense. When we do that, I don't think anyone can beat us."

I worked for Frank & Mary's, a family-run restaurant in Pittsboro. I was a dish washer, buser, salad maker, et cetera. There I learned to appreciate entrepreneurship in general. Pittsboro was a really small town, and I learned from seeing how a successful business that spanned over several years and generations continued to produce well and maintain a family atmosphere. It helped make them successful. (The Herring family recently sold the restaurant.)

The proof that this is wrong can be seen every morning on most metro freeways, where the State Patrol has abandoned any pretense of enforcement, and drivers regulate their own speeds. The main function isn't "safety" but to allow armed public union members to justify their jobs by fining a random and tiny selection of motorists for exceeding the arbitrary posted limits.

The fact that high unemployment and budget deficits are occurring at the same time has generated confusion about the real sources of the slump. The increased deficit is a consequence, not a cause, of the downturn. When economic activity falls, so does tax revenue. Some categories of government spending, such as unemployment benefits, automatically rise during a recession. This contributes to a higher deficit.

Intentional continuity errors, missing frames and cheap production values abound. Far more effort went into making "Casa de mi Padre" look like crap than making it, you know, legitimately good.
