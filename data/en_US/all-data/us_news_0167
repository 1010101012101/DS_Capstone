Part of what makes Hank's job harder is where he and Laurel live - in the cove, deep in the shadow of a cliff on land that neighboring folks believe is cursed. Before the war, they shunned the brother and sister, crossing the street to avoid them and sometimes spitting in their paths or peppering them with eggs. Now with Hank back from the war, they focus their cruelty on Laurel alone.

The Bears don't have enough firepower this year to move up, and they don't want to trade any picks from future drafts after picking so late the last couple of years after the Jay Cutler trade. If there are enough players they like to justify the move, the Bears might be best off trading down and adding more depth to a team that is aging fast, particularly on defense. And with a stated goal of acquiring four future starters, the Bears need all the picks they can get.
The controversial onstage antics that made Alice Cooper every mother's nightmare in his gallows-rocking prime may constitute the most compelling case for Cooper's long-deserved induction to the Hall of Fame.

Beef carpaccio ($10) is also first rate; it's crowned with arugula, thin slices of fried potatoes and crunchy nubs of fried capers.

Notable: Cavs likely will be without Daniel Gibson (ankle) and Anthony Parker (back). Alonzo Gee is expected to start at shooting guard. . . . Cavs are hoping they can get another productive night from center Semih Erden, who scored a career high 18 points in Wednesday's win over Indiana. The Heat has beaten the Cavs twice this season in Miami. This is the third and final meeting of the season.

Titus, 25, is the fastest American this year in the 100-meter breaststroke (1:00.86).

Could Peyton help Tim Tebow? Well, I would think anyone could learn a whole lot about football under Peyton Manning. Not only how to play the position but how to read defenses, how to be a complete quarterback. However, my hunch is if the Peyton Manning-Denver Broncos relationship becomes a marriage, I think Tim might be traded. There is a very strong possibility it would be Jacksonville that would look at Tim as a guy who could really come in and save the franchise. Bring him back home, and help build the team around him."

He insists he grew his mustache only because his father had one. But this filial devotion didn't endear him to teammates. Several players conspired to grow their own mustaches so Jackson would blend in. (Take a moment to appreciate that logic: The A's were so annoyed with Jackson, they decided to look more like him.) Then the real twist: Finley, who was never a wallflower when it came to marketing gimmicks, offered $300 to anybody on the team who also grew one. Thus, the "Mustache Gang" was born.

The other approach is to find some other condition that affects whether students go to college without reflecting on their abilities, and use it as a sort of natural experiment, a sorting mechanism between the student and worker. These have included distance from undergraduate institutions, or the happenstance of finishing high school in a year in which college capacity was greatly expanded or contracted.

Of course, he and others noted, the world will change on Jan. 1, 2014, when the federal health reform's main components  the prohibition on pre-existing conditions being used to deny applicants or to charge higher rates, and the requirement that everyone obtain insurance  take effect. Individual consumers then will be able to seek coverage directly from insurers or through the state's Health Benefit Exchange, an online bazaar of sorts that is intended to ease the chore of comparing and buying policies. Sliding-scale subsidies will help low- and moderate-income buyers afford the coverage.

"Seeking Justice" is memorable only because it contains what may be my favorite new Cage line reading of all time: During a stressful moment, when a secretary asks him if it's proper grammar to capitalize the second word in a hyphenated compound, Cage patiently replies "Only if it's a noun and the words have equal weight. Like 'Homeland-Security.' If it's a participle modifying the first word, you better keep it lower case."
Two weeks ago, the Beavers won 7-1 at PK Park. The game did not count in the Pac-12 standings, either, but it seemed to signify a change in the state’s balance of baseball power.

The widening gulf between the haves and have-nots, the 1 percent and the 99 percent, over the past three decades is not merely some partisan invention of President Obama, the Democrats or the Occupy Wall Street protesters but a real and worrisome trend fueled largely by the financial sector. Income inequality inevitably gives rise to economic instability — which is essentially what's happening in the European Union, where income differences are even more out of whack.

Indeed, at 112 minutes, "Reunion" is easily the series' longest entry, largely because it feels the need to cross-reference and embellish anything even remotely memorable from the prior three films.

Now what? If you know, you are a wiser man than I am. We have a great deal of running around about it, visionaries providing us with a lot of pat destinies: one set trying to make us the most cultured nation on earth, and demanding that we pile novel on top of symphony on top of skyscraper until we claim our place in the aesthetic sun; another set trying to make us the most moral nation on earth, piling Prohibition laws on top of cigarette laws on top of anti-Evolution laws on top of blue laws; another set trying to make us the most prosperous nation on earth, piling tariffs on top of R.F.C.'s on top of apostrophes to the Forgotten Man. But all these stars, unfortunately, begin to look a great deal like fish-scales, and where we are actually headed, if anywhere, it is pretty hard, for me at least, to see.

But in 1906, the opposite may have happened. The official number of dead was under 500. Years later, others, notably former city archivist Gladys Hansen and former fire chief Emmet Condon, wrote in a book called "Denial of Disaster" that the death toll was much higher -- their number was 3,000. The number of dead was deliberately kept low, they said, because a large death toll might be bad for business. The real number of deaths will probably never be known. And after 100 years, it may not matter.

Hey, Jeff: I think the Browns can scheme to compensate for McCoy's arm strength to a degree.

I also agree with your point about throwing on the run. It's great to be able to do that on occasion, but a quarterback has to conduct most of his business from the pocket to effectively beat a defense.

Her ensuing operatic death is perhaps the strongest moment of the production.

Several years ago we refinanced our house and took cash out to pay off our credit card bills. It felt good, but was short-lived when we needed car repairs and medical bills started piling up. We needed to use our credit cards because we didn't have the cash to take care of the problems, and now they are back up there with high interest rates and payments.

In that regard, his two ejections in 2 ½ weeks are not unlike the eager-beaver 3-point shot he launched at Golden State in between the losses to Houston.

Among the results of western expansion in the 19th century is that every pioneering town of reasonable size built an opera house - with faint hope of European sophistication - although it's a good bet that a lot of what happened on stage was not exactly what Rossini and Mozart had in mind. These days, the biggest and wealthiest West Coast cities have grand venues for their world-class performing companies, although those vaunted concert halls are not the only places to appreciate opera's pleasures and passion.
Alan Byrd, a spokesman for the local franchisee, said the restaurant would be the chain's largest yet. It is slated to feature a 7,000-square-foot interior space, a 3,000-square-foot patio along International Drive and a 4,000-square-foot rooftop bar.

Every station preempts its network sometimes. A certain number of preemptions are written into their contracts, but KSDK has broken new ground in bumping NBC programs so often in the first month of the new season. I'm not giving repeat information, because if you want to watch a preempted program, you don't have to look for a repeat on the offending station.

Why he makes sense: There is a strong chance Hightower won’t be there when the Ravens pick. That’s why King believes they will have to trade up to get him. But if he makes it to pick No. 29, it would be hard for them to pass on this playmaker. He was the brains of the Alabama defense -- insert obligatory Ozzie Newsome comment here -- and his physical style is perfect for the Ravens, who will soon live life without Ray Lewis. As a bonus, Hightower has the versatility to play outside linebacker and could compete with Paul Kruger for a spot in the starting lineup right away.

Was the president's speech even an attempt to pressure the court? If so, it was spectacularly ill-timed, as it's likely the court made its decision in private deliberations several days earlier. In reality, it was the nation's chief executive exercising his own Constitutionally-protected right to express an opinion about a law that he believes in passionately — just like he did when he criticized the Supreme Court for its Citizens United decision during his 2011 State of the Union Address, something that also made conservatives (including some on the court) apoplectic.

Parents are obviously suspect here, but accusing them won't do much to help the kids they're overfeeding. I'm supportive of targeted interventions in school districts where the problem is worst, most of which are in the South and Southern parts of the Midwest.

On the other side of the street, it's about people who deeply appreciate Lugar's willingness to consider more views than the one in his head. It's about a hope that Capitol Hill won't remain as gridlocked as it has been these past few years, and that more lawmakers with Lugar's reasonableness will take office, or at least that fewer will be tossed out. It's about a belief that this country needs lawmakers less inclined to explain the country's problems in simplistic political sound bites, and more capable of grasping the global picture -- yes, even if that means missing the Posey County GOP Lincoln Day dinner because it conflicts with a trip to the former Soviet Union.

And I don’t know who said, “We just girls, we’re not meant to be beaten down this well,” but I want to smack her. First of all, it's grammatically incorrect and makes no sense, and, second, did I mention that I camped in the snow when I was 8? Because I did, and I also portaged a canoe on my head when I was 11. And no one was offering me a chance to win $1 million, either. I’m sure every former female "Survivor" contestant also wants to smack this bunch of women. Buck up, ladies.
In its most recent quarterly report, Marcus & Millichap forecast that retailers will continue opening new locations at a measured pace throughout the rest of the year, with reduced rents making many sites feasible. Even with some growth, the retail market is not expected to operate at its full potential while the slump in home building persists. The report said retail-property investors should anticipate several more quarters of strong competition for the limited number of tenants seeking new locations, with only a gradual, albeit consistent, tightening in vacancy rates.

Billig was a remarkable woman. When I first started reviewing shows at her theater, in the 1990s, Billig was ensconced in the basement of the Park Forest library.

His widow found TV news cameras — cameras that had never bothered to film the artistic work she cared so desperately about — gathered on her front doorstep, in love with the salacious story.

Haduong avoids gluten. Does she need to, or has she latched on to the fad du jour? Gibson notes that only 1% of the population actually has celiac disease and maybe 4% to 5% more have a gluten intolerance. Cutting out gluten if you don't have those problems makes for an overly restrictive diet. Haduong says she feels better and has less joint paint when she's gluten-free, but Gibson encourages her to experiment with adding a whole wheat items back to her diet for the fiber and nutrients they contain.

He might've just been known as a journeyman junk baller; instead, Moyer's mark on the game now comes from the fact that his baseball card soon will double as an AARP card. Then again, Madonna is still shaking her body at 53, so why can't Moyer still be slinging curves at 49?"

Hey, Tony: Let me see if I understand this: The 2011 draft day trade was ill-advised because the Browns would be much better off with a stud wide receiver. Instead they have two stud defensive linemen and an extra first rounder next year. Now you say there should be no hesitancy in trading 2012's two first rounders, plus 2013's first rounder and a mid-round pick (mortgaging the future), to take a chance on a QB who may turn out to be another Ryan Leaf. Even though we would be unable to make that trade without making the trade last April, we would still have no stud wide receiver for the franchise QB! I need to step away from the computer because this makes no sense. -- George Amer, Gallatin, Tenn.

He looked into the shower and saw a boy of about 10, with his hands up against the wall. A naked Sandusky was having intercourse with him. The assistant left.

Whoever the geniuses may be behind these coordinated political attacks, they need to get a little more creative. When everyone from a first-term Kansas congressman to a Fox TV talking head to Rush Limbaugh employs the same sound bite, it is not hard to guess they are reciting from the same Republican National Committee talking points.
