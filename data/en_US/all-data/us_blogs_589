Focus Series is a good one day thing, but when you expect me to take the information I gain in that one day and use it every day to get out there and help fight human trafficking, you’re expecting too much out of me. Call me lazy. Call me ignorant. It’s not my ministry. I’m aware of it and that’s probably the best you can ask of me right now.

Another example tests the “well-made” against the “good” is the above illustration. Basically is simply gives you an idea of what a piece of Fritz Maytag’s blue cheese looks like and the bottle of a particular beer that I chose to drink. I can tell you that both the beer and the piece of cheese were no more than 50°F as presented.

As for the issue of continuing to blog more generally, perhaps about reverse culture shock or looking at the U.S. through a different lens, I'm not certain. The experience of being an expat has given me clear boundaries when it comes to content. What you see here is me, but it's only a slice of me. I'm not sure the boundaries will be so easy to maintain from the other side.
If that is how they have to treat the people taking this test, I am a shoo-in.
The girls don’t really like Irish dancing so there is a good chance that they will give it up before long. We really wanted them to have something Irish in their lives but you can’t really force them to love something they are not into. Besides that Daisy is still doing swimming diplomas and Nadia will start her lessons next year. It makes for a very busy timetable.

Then in March of 1948, all hell began to break loose. Enter Fredric Wertham. Dr. Fredric Wertham was a Bellevue Hospital psychiatrist with impeccable credentials, a champion of “social psychiatry” dealing with the needs of the poor and minorities. Born in Bavaria, Germany in 1895 (as Frederic I. Wertheimer) and earning a degree in medicine, he came to the United States in 1922 to work in the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1932 he was the senior psychiatrist at Bellevue. In 1941 he wrote Dark Legend, A Study in Murder, a case study of a 17 year old boy who killed his mother, and in 1944 (some sources say 1946) he opened the LaFargue Clinic in Harlem, the first clinic to specialize in the treatment of African-Americans with psychiatric illness and therefore came into contact with scores and scores of disturbed children, children both deemed juvenile delinquents and those seriously (diagnosed by 1940's standards) mentally ill. Wertham became the most important critic of the impact on children by the mass media, and by extension, comic books.

“Success comes when you can look in the mirror and you like what’s looking back,” Orman says. “You’re proud of what you’ve created. You’re proud of what you’re doing, even if it doesn’t give you a financial reward and nobody buys it. You’re proud of yourself.”
Hey everyone & happy Saturday!

What's that you say, creators of Lost? The characters WERE in a horrible plane crash that they never could have survived? You mean, all this time they were walking around this magical Island, they were really dead the whole time? And now that Jack and Kate and Sawyer and Locke and Sayid and Hurley, and Claire and everybody has fought their last battle, and they're ready to go home, they all finally realize that they're dead, so they meet up together in a CHURCH, and can finally move on to the hereafter, heaven, whatever that is.
Yeah, so we walked over to an elevator, you know the elevator down a short hallway that looks accessible and also off limits? Yeah, that elevator. We get on. We head up to catering. It was surreal. I have been backstage many times before with other concert venues, but never for a show this big.

On a strange side note, the part of the Cool Breeze that always freaks me out is the section that we have to ride ON THE FREEWAY! About 3 miles going north and about 4.5 miles going south... and my worst fear happened this year... two female riders were hit by trailer... THANK GOD they are going to be alright...

These blessings will be joy and rejoicing in your posterity of healthy, happy children, which blessings those who reject this way of life will never know. There will be peace and satisfaction in the accomplishments of children who succeed and in turn make their own contribution to making this a better world for generations yet unborn. What a joyous privilege and blessing it will be for those families who, through obedience and love, have prepared themselves to go back into the presence of our Heavenly Father and have it said of each of them, “Well done, thou good and faithful servant … enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” (Matt. 25:21)"
When it comes down to it, I believe to be the best at anything, you need to understand the inherent depth of complexities for what you’re dealing with and this more often than not may involve pursuing multiple fields of knowledge to truly grasp your own discipline. In some sense, I believe the leaders in any field are polymaths of sort and this is something Eric clearly demonstrates in his own regard.

The two sisters stared at one another across the room as the object of their affection – their adored daughter – proceeded to tell of her epic adventure. Only when they were required to respond did they break their gaze and ‘ooh’ and ‘ahh’ with her delightful story, bright smiles on both their faces now, their eyes twinkling. Only once more did their eyes meet, and that was prompted by the shadow of Laura’s husband at the door who looked between them and cocked his head questioningly. Their expressions faltered momentarily as their eyes made contact, and Laura just shook her head ‘no’ while Hayley squeezed Lily-Rose tightly on her lap.
Yes. And I was disabused of the notion that the zinc lozenges that my family has always used actually had some effect. We really are a pretty gullible species, and in a lot of these cases, if any of these remedies work, it may be due to the force of our own beliefs, the placebo effect.

A trail of phone calls led the tenacious Ms Alvis to a Pennsylvania forest. There, she was taught to lay raccoon and fox traps. Marshmallows, a bacon-scented potion and a grape jelly-like mixture was enough to entice raccoons, or coon, to the vicious spring-mounted traps along muddy riverbanks.

What we come to believe is real may not be at all. But beliefs are vey powerful, whether they are based in fact, or not. So, it is best we come to terms, sooner or later, with the idea that whatever we think is real is determined entirely by what we perceive, and why we perceive it that way. After all, our own perceptions of things are about the only thing we really have to go on, aren’t they?

Get your wellies ready and your raincoats out, we’re in for a rough ride, or so the weather forecast tells me. We’ve had some pretty heavy rain showers the past two days and it’s very blustery out there. We’re due some very strong winds tonight and tomorrow and there’s a gale warning in effect.
However, the rayon/poly blend suiting turned out to be more polyester than I originally thought, and I decided that matching a plaid fabric that I was not in love with was not worth the effort. Thankfully, a bit of bemberg rayon lining takes some of the static cling out of the fabric. Still, I do not anticipate getting much wear out of these pants. But I suppose it was a good exercise in pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

Those who are lucky enough to be Impossible Pioneers were able to snag a few packs after receiving a secret email about one month ago. We were also asked not to upload our images anywhere except for the ‘test photographers’ group Impossible created on Flickr. It was hard. We all wanted to show of our images. So after a month of shooting and testing, I think we’re OK to share our images and experiences.

Imagine among all these names in the first two chapters of 1 Chronicles, Achar still has the reputation as the one who troubled Israel. At the battle of Jericho this man took something he wasn’t supposed to and at the next battle Israel lost because of what he did. He was later stoned and burnt, but still he is remembered much later in the Bible for the same thing, troubling Israel.

The hard part was returning - we've been home for a week now and other than an hour of sun yesterday, it's been cold, wet and rainy pretty much ever since our return. The studio seems extra quiet now too, after a week of hanging out with my co-conspirator (aka my husband).
I can’t believe I’ve left my characters in the hands of the evil queen for so long. I can practically hear their panic.
Ciudad Juarez is considered to be Mexico's drug murder capital, but Juarez is several times larger than Los Mochis, and Mochis is home to the four largest drug cartels in Mexico. I'm sure that you've heard of Juarez (below), but you might not know that much about Los Mochis. That has more to do with the lack of press coverage than the fact that there is something to cover there. Reporters unfavorable to cartel members simply don't last long.

While you may confuse this wine with a Burgundy from France, it, too, is all Oregon. Sarver Winery 2008 Pinot Noir has stolen my heart. First I must admit my absolute adoration for the Pinot Noir grape. Pinot Noir, for me, evokes the best of all that is feminine. From goddesses to tom boys, you can find it in Pinot Noir. Elegant and refined; sassy and sexy; earthy and unpretentious; those contrasts can all be detected in Pinot Noir, and if you're lucky, sometimes you find it all in one glass. That is the case here. Let's fill up your glass, and we'll talk more about the wine a little later.
Why do we do this to ourselves, and how can we overcome it?
I came along in 1974, as Norma Smires's (Mam-Maw's) great-granddaughter. The world had changed considerably. Schools were larger, and new education tools such as videos, filmstrips, and computer replaced the older methods. Chores for 1980s children were nearly nonexistent in comparison to the expectations placed on children of the 1920's. Movies, Tv., toys, radio, skating rinks, and video games entertained us. Microwave ovens and fast-food restaurants replaced home-cooked meals. Laundry was done by machines, and housework was accomplished with relative ease. Dance classes and tee ball games infiltrated the world of the toddler. Thanks to the feminist movement, girls were expected to finish high school, go to college, and have the same career aspirations as boys. Girls married later, and had fewer children. Lots of kids had a mom, a dad, a stepmom, a stepdad, siblings, and one or two step-siblings, due to the rise in divorces. Holidays were increasingly commercial events. Courtesy and good manners were still important at home, but Tv and movies were showing us that it could be "cool" to rebel, to talk back, even to disrespect others. The strong sense of "neighbor" and "community" was eclipsed by an egocentric mentality that valued self-interest and personal gain. Living life was easier, but enjoying life was harder, because it required money or material possessions.

Patagonia’s founder, Yvon Chouinard, is a legendary environmental activist and climber. His company is among the most well known retailer for engaging in Cause Marketing.

"Google cannot deny its undivided responsibility for any infringement findings.

This is what my polish looked like after 6 days. Please excuse the cuticles - they're in desperate need of manicure attention at this point. Though you can see some tip wear, there is absolutely no chipping. Sweet! The index finger has a strange reflection on the tip that's making it look like a chip, but there is no chip there, just some minimal tip wear. This is a more accurate picture of the color than the one below.
Leave it to a brilliant person.

One of my fiercest fights has always been for personal liberty, and the biggest concern being laws that destroy it, because once taken away personal liberty never returns. Gay marriage laws, seat belt laws, helmet laws…these might please special interests but they are bad laws. The government is supposed to protect me from others, not from myself.

Actually, I'd probably just go ahead and get it, but it turns out I didn't have quite enough withheld from my paycheck for Federal income taxes ( Apparently I'm still poor, but not that poor. Confusing, I know.), and now I owe the Feds a pretty penny, which, at the moment, means I'm terrified of spending money on anything that isn't absolutely necessary. Don't worry, I'll get over it. Frivolity is in my bones. But, Boehner, if you're reading, please note that I would like that extra money to go to healthcare, roads, and EDUCATION, ok? Thanks, homeslice.
The whole experience was sweet and magnificent and the movie was great. I love that the main character of the movie was a villain and the movie was very funny. Our older daughter, who is 5 (almost 6) was laughing at some parts. It is nice that we can watch a movie and laugh at some jokes together now. My two-year-old got a bit antsy towards the end, but she was able to sit through the whole movie.
I was shaking. This isn't at all what I had expected. And if she wont tell me in an email.. it's got to be bad. She never talks about emotions and now she wants to meet me face to face to tell me something about their childhood, perhaps even mine.
For the same earthly reason they go to sporting events or concerts or other entertainment venues for there they have crowds around them. Temporarily, they feel that need satisfied, but again I say, only for a time. Then the lonely feeling of isolation returns.
The bright side I suppose is that some previous bad driving on his part meant I was watching him like a hawk, or a salt marsh harvest mouse looking for a hawk. About a mile previous, he was second in a 3 car line of cars, I was #3. I don't know our speed, it wasn't fast enough to notice or slow enough to notice, when he suddenly pulls out across a double yellow line with an blind intersection approaching, and passed the #1 car. The #1 car made a left at the intersection, and as I came around the corner, #2 didn't seem as far away as I would have expected.
As you can see, I've got a lot of questions circling around my head and heart this morning. What is your truth?
Still, more often than not, the Washington news media served only as a conveyor belt for P.R. boiler-plate. In a typical description, The New York Times called Whitehead’s Rutherford Institute “a kind of evangelical Christian civil liberties union” — which is how Rutherford describes itself in its publicity material. The P.R. handouts just leave out “kind of.”

I counted 47 Black Swallowtail caterpillars on my parsley crop. They love any plant in the carrot family; dill, Queen Anne's Lace and of course parsley. I've harvested plenty and am leaving the rest for the butterflies. I saw the eggs nestled into the cup like leaves before I went to California; when I got back to Chickory, the 'pillars were fat and fine from heavy feeding. When they are alarmed, they discourage predators with their osmeterium; a forked orange gland that makes a horrible smell. That's why the chicks won't eat them. (They love tomato hornworms though)

To someone who doesn’t belong to the coercive caste, a total of 6 arrests out of 166 “total incidents” isn’t an impressive ratio. The concept of a “self-initiated significant incident” seems downright ominous. This is the portrait of a government-licensed bully bent on manufacturing cases, rather than a peace officer devoted to protection of persons and property. A brief examination of Reichert’s past supplies that portrait with
Construction has not yet commenced on Tishman Speyer's planned office development on the site of the Queens Plaza Municipal garage. The developer has announced plans to build the Gotham Center: four towers, some more than 40 stories tall, totaling 3.5 million square feet of mixed-use space on the two parcels in Queens Plaza. Real estate sources said the first phase of the project will be a 20-story, 750,000-square-foot office tower, with the city committed to leasing about half of the space.
However, thanks to the gods of writing, another idea popped into my head one day as I cycled round the island I was living on, an idea so exciting and weird that I knew I wanted that to be my next book. And the idea was not only almost fully formed, I knew I could write it very quickly.
Been working, subbing at the schools. The jobs have been busy, as teachers are burned OUT! ha ha. I only have a few weeks left of this and then I'm in trouble. Jobless. Actually I've been applying for summer work but I did not realize how hard it is to find part time seasonal work. Maybe I'll just need to fib a little and tell them I want permanent? I dunno. Any ideas? I might end up at fast food if I get desperate enough. I cannot work too many hours. With 4 kids still at home it's hard to take a full-time gig. The 2 little ones are 9 and 11 and will be home all summer. They both will attend summer school session for June. July they will drive me bananas and then August 10th or something they go back again-yes, it's early here in Arizona.

Since they weren't going to be sold at Holt anymore, there was a mini sale going on with a bunch of the Benefit products, ranging from $15, $20 and $25. The boxed blushes were all $20, cream eyeshadows were $15 and skincare was from $20-25! There were also things like the concealer kits, lipgloss and lip sticks, liquid blushes, eyeshadows and a few other eye brow things.Cheap right? But I only picked up the High Brow.

It seems that every year this tops my list of goals for the upcoming new year: Scripture Memorization. But, unfortunately, it is also one of the goals that I never seem to reach. I have plenty of excuses like, "memorization is difficult" or "I'm really not that good at remembering stuff" but the truth of the matter is that I just don't try. If I can remember pointless lines from songs or tv shows from the 90's (Seinfeld is a favorite) I am certainly capable of memorizing Scripture. So then I'm left with the pathetic realization that if I am capable of memorizing scripture perhaps the problem lies in whether I see it important to memorize it (as if Seinfeld lines are important...)
There is a reason that there is a Starbucks on every corner. Without the steady stream of caffeine, who could possible get it all done? And can you ever really get it all done, or is that just an illusion that we cling to while trying to dress in the dress of responsibility. Everyone I know feels like life is going too fast. Monday morning brought thoughts of “the weekend was too short.” Was the weekend really short or was it filled with all of the weekend stuff that needs to get done that replaces the weekday stuff that needs to get done? The truth is time is consistent. You cannot change it. It is we who put a measurement on it and decide and assign a meaning of slow or too fast.
Professor Gross concluded that the false conviction rate for death row inmates has ranged from 2.3 percent to 5 percent. Were even the lower end of that range applied to people who received prison sentences of a year or more in the last three decades, he wrote, it would suggest that about 185,000 innocent people have served hard time.

“Frank Bartleman was an early leader of the Pentecostal movement at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles, California. He was a central figure in the Azusa Street revival of 1906. His reports published in the holiness press heralded a world-wide revival. Bartleman’s journalism helped to inform the world of the Pentecostal renewal and was largely responsible for promoting a revival that is still spreading throughout the world. The following is an excerpt from Azusa Street, Frank Bartleman’s chronicle of the birth of the Pentecostal movement.”

There’s a catch. At the Double X meeting, Michelle rejects one boring magazine concepts after another. In comes Mi Roo with an old, new idea. She proposes publishing a novel as a serial. Michelle is unconvinced that they will get cooperation from publishing companies and whether it will relevant to a woman’s magazine like Double X. Mi Roo proposes that the story needs to relate to today’s women and since the column is so popular with readers, the story will be about Sofia. She’s also got a writer lined up: Lee Joon. Michelle is still dubious about whether they can pull this off. After all, they need Sofia’s permission and Mi Roo points out that the novel isn’t about the old Sofia but rather the one writing the column. She will give her permission and Michelle looks impressed at Mi Roo’s guts.

The Worm's Head.
As Dr. House says, “Everyone lies,” and I know that’s true. But I am an idealist to the core—a Meyers-Briggs tested and retested, less than 2% of the population, INFJ idealist and so it has been a lifelong challenge for me to wrap my head around concepts that others find so very simply. Take fairness, for example. I think that the first words out of my mother’s mouth after my birth were, “I love you. Life isn’t fair.” She repeated those words many, many times as I grew up and yet I never believed her. Life should be fair! People should tell the truth! If you are a good person, then that should be enough! I have mentally and emotionally worn myself out over the years battling, inwardly and outwardly, with these concepts that everyone else seems to inherently just “get.”

But instead I have been working out with my Wii Fit Plus. I have to say I love it. My husband bought me a Wii and the Wii Fit Plus with balance board after I had our 5 month old as he knew it would be hard for me to hit back to the gym right after having a baby. He knew I wanted to get back in shape. I have to say it has not been bad considering I was working out the whole time I was pregnant and before I got pregnant with her.
Yesterday (Sunday) was the last race in this year's season and with 4 drivers in the running for the championship it proved to be a good race. 1 crash - Schumacher spinning before being mounted by Liuzzi (pic from bild.de) where Schumi looked to be inches away from decapitation, but thanks to modern technology the F1 cars these days seem to have life preserving capabilities.

Now I know why people take forever to start their recaps... I went through them online yesterday and it took hours. There are SO MANY! I can't wait to share them with you guys though. So stay tuned! Oh and I'll finish my lame recaps of our trip to Jamaicaaaaa soon! I should just photograph my thighs, write "I took all-inclusive as a personal eating challenge" and leave it at that.

I was fortunate enough to get my beery paws on a few pints of Tempest's Emanation Pale Ale, Elemental Porter and their RyePA. The outstanding beer of the three was the Rye. It is a 5.5% IPA that is a blend of Rye and Maris Otter malt dry hopped with U.S. Columbus hops that is loaded full of tangy orange citrus hop flavour undercut with a sweet, caramel malt and subtle spiced pepper. It was an intriguing and very moreish pint and proof that Tempest brewery are definately one to watch.

MeWowZa, Teri was more than excited, because now they could stay together AND she would get to see them both from time-to-time when they came into the vets. She said this was like her best wish answered, and she hopes they will both be happy in their new home...of course, she will be there with advice when needed and with the promise to take them back with open arms if their new home doesn't work out...

While the archetypes (personifications of aspects of the unconsciousness) that dominate Invoking Ireland are predominantly Irish, Moriarty also draws copiously on myths, legends and religions from all over the world. Again and again he reiterates his central message that humanity has taken a wrong turn somewhere along the way and is not paying attention to what those myths and the characters who are inhabiting them are telling us about ourselves. We are more than the base Fomorian (self) that inhabits this world and exploits it for our own benefit, we are also Tuath Dé Dannan and can access vast untapped reserves within ourselves if we so choose.

I mentioned over a month ago that the Guardians of Otis had traveled to a place called “Twos On” on what I presumed was official Cult of Otis business. Well, it seems I was correct. Recently Brother Oliver was messing around with the Guardians’ computer when he stumbled across a recording and some photos that he says blew him away. The recording was the voice of a kitty, and he had a strange drawl to his speech. He was telling a story, and he went on for over an hour.

The epidermis can be separated into three parts and inner part, middle part and the surface of the epidermis. There are way lot of elements that actually trouble the epidermis and cause getting older. These causes of getting older can be separated into two groups as built-in getting older and exterior getting older. Let's see these issues independently.
For example: In this headline, the removal of one word would cut down word consumption (of this particular phrase anyway) by 20%: Nursing Student Mysteriously Vanishes. Um . . . yeah. Seems as if “vanishing” implies mysterious. Have you ever heard of a vanishing that wasn’t mysterious? Unless the nursing student had planned to vanish, called all her friends together, and said, “Good-bye. I’m going to vanish now.” Still, that in itself would be mysterious. How would she do it, and more importantly, why?
A plethora of radical new municipal building swept across the country from the 1950s onwards — schools, hospitals, offices, civic centres, entertainment and sports venues, shopping parades, shopping malls, new road schemes and street furniture, and apartment tower blocks to house tenants whose “slums” had been bombed or condemned as unfit for habitation.
If they choose to use some of their bucks, they are essentially RENTING the system from us. The length of time the renting lasts starts at the end of the schoolday (when they have earned their bucks for completing schoolwork and chores) and lasts until 10am the next day, when we usuallu begin school. So, the quicker they get their work done the longer they will have with their games. Oh, and they can not turn in bad work. Rushing through and claiming to be done, even when you know it's substandard work is considered cheating, aka lying, and will cost you bucks. There are exceptions to this. Using the computer or ipad for school work isn't limited. Using computer programming games like Alics (from Columbia University) or Scratch (from MIT) and creating their own games is not limited.
As I prepared to leave Moncton, I gave back the keys I’d held to my friend’s homes, knowing it wasn’t really necessary for me to hold them anymore. But one friend wouldn’t take her key back.

But that's the socko finale to the sequence. The meat comes earlier, establishing the symbolic vocabulary and the themes of the movie with incredible elegance and economy. It begins with the full moon, the ancient image of another world gazing dispassionately at us, from a distance. The camera moves to a tree and down to where the bark has been cut open and a shunt stabbed into the trunk, as the white rubber drip, drip, drips into a bucket--more than just sexually suggestive, the image tells us the life of the plantation is steady, monotonous, wearing away at the residents like the proverbial water torture. The sound of the dripping carries over the music played by the workers, then fades as the camera moves steadily to their open-sided hut. And the camera begins to ascend back toward the trees, showing the Malayan workers playing mah-jongg, talking quietly, sweat still gleaming on their bodies, their clothes still dirty from the day's labors. They try to sleep in their hammocks despite the mosquitos and the still, heavy air, a sense of suffocation that will echo throughout the film. Up to the thatched roof of the quarters, and only then back down, through the bamboo sides of the quarters and the latticework in the garden (the first of innumerable "cage" images) over to the bird. Then the gunshot, and a cut to the workers, then the owners' house, the white man dying in his proper jacket, Davis in correct at-home evening attire as she shoots him, again and again. And the workers running to the house, stopping and staring at the dead man, and then at Davis with mingled apprehension and revulsion. She drops the gun, the first of many shots that will connect the ground to death, either past or future. Finally, the camera moves in for a close-up on Davis, establishing the suspense for the audience, the whydunit.

Our home is not a place with walls and couches and papers and entertainment centers. Our home is, simply, the way we live our life. Home is the abandon and trust through which we engage with our life. It is the spirit with which we learn, and experience, and grow. It is the peace with which we connect with the people around us, and where you are surrounded by things that comfort and challenge and intrigue us. It is the pursuit of the chance to be the happiest we have ever been, where we are the "us" we can be and the "us" we wish to be. Home may be a physical place for some, but for us home is a state of being, like a roller coaster with no real end, with our love as the car keeping us safe and our hearts as the track guiding us ever higher.
And for anyone reading who thinks this all sounds wonderful but…. yes there are low spots too – times when its really hard to keep going but writing reviews like this, working with others and having the opportunity to create are just fantastic.

I can still remember seeing scenes on television of the furor and turmoil occurring in Little Rock, Arkansas when a number of African American school children started attending classes at a previously all white school. I began questioning my parents about the whats and whys of what was going on there and for the first time started to apprehend that massive and monstrous obvious 'unfairnesses' went on and on and often never ever changed.

On Halloween, our neighborhood is one of those that doesn't give out candy anymore.....the kids around here all go to church, school or private parties so they are not out on the streets after dark. I used to get a kick out of seeing all the costumes, but it really is much safer for them to just have a supervised party. Besides that, the last few years that kids were coming around, I was only getting bigger high school kids, not even in costume.....the little ones were celebrating in a safer environment.
I will tell you firstly the most difficult part of this process was choosing a photo. I really wanted to have a canvas made from a photo of my boys. But the most recent photo I had of the three of them together was about three years old, and, unfortunately, it was blurry (an example of my poor photography skills!).

Since there was little incidental cost to recording movies, we recorded lots, but we only ever went back and watched a handful. Some got a lot of play. I watched Spaceballs and The Goonies over and over until my mom got sick of them and recorded over the tapes. Most, though, got watched once, if at all. If someone came over and wanted to watch a movie, we had plenty of options, though. That may have been what kept my mom buying those twelve-packs of tapes.

Well, after three runs at the new frosting, I don't have it nailed yet (but I'm close!). Made a terrible salad for my family's Easter get-together. Had two disappointments from my "Project" list.

It was in Jack’s closet that I had the hard time. Of course. His closet looks very close to the way it looked on January 15, 2009. I distributed some of his t-shirts to family and friends, but I set aside 18-20 to use in a quilt or wallhanging. I kept them in a sack because I perceived that they still carried something of his smell. They probably didn’t, definitely don’t now. But I was afraid they’d lose whatever imagined remnants of Jack if I left them on hangers.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, a division of the National Institutes of Health, notes that schizophrenia in particular seems to have a link to marijuana use, as a 2007 study found. This may be due to the fact that frequent use of marijuana case can cause a dire psychotic reaction in susceptible people, according to the NIDA, making it a possible factor in the onset or relapse of schizophrenia.
I’m constantly learning new things about myself. This thing with Robbie is but another learning experience. I think I’m still in the process of learning even more.
As an expat, once a year I have to file for renewal of my FM3 documentation that allows me to legally reside in Mexico. I no longer try to do it myself since my Spanish is laughable and this is serious business. They ask for copies of bank statements, passports, and utility bills that prove you have been living here and have been responsible. They also require new photos because we change so much in a year they want to be able to recognize us, and their cousin is a photographer, That last part about the cousin I made up, but I would not be surprised. Oh, and a suggestion to those who are going through the process for the first time, get a professional to do it for you, rules change daily. Also, if you are asked for two copies, hand them four; a little tidbit I picked up after getting to spend more time in the immigration office than I have ever spent in any of my apartments here. Sounds easy, but it is busy work that keeps one from the business of moving. My timing of events is, as always, impeccable.

In my opinion, addiction is self-programming run amok. We are self-programming beings. If we learn to deal with overwhelming emotions by shutting down our central nervous systems with a six pack (or two), then that will become our default behavior. Eventually, we will literally not be able to do otherwise. Until we learn a new program.

Beginning just west of Interstate 49 is the short Opelousas stretch of the highway. A longstanding white metal sign with a reflective green silhouette of Louisiana welcomes me to what here is called the LA-31 Spur. The state highway department is unhurriedly swapping these old green and white signs with more contemporary looking black and white ones. I hope they are not too competent in their efforts; I will miss seeing the occasional old ones.

But Mama missed teaching, and she took it upon herself to instruct not only my brothers and myself, but all the nearby neighbor children in the games and activities she'd learned in the teacher program at Martha Washington College. The other children's mothers were more conventional 1950's housewives, who spent their days cleaning and watching soap operas, and did not want noisy, dirty children tromping in and out of their houses disturbing them. So our house and our yard was the place to play because my mother welcomed the children - most of the kids found that it was a small price to pay to have my mother instruct them in how to play various traditional games ("Red light, Green light," "Duck, duck, goose," etc.) and supervise the play.

But there's something else too, a certain recapitulated variation on a theme. Through it all, through the very hard times and the very good times, I can count on the fact, as surely as I can count on rain and sun and day and night, that I will never tire of the clamor of life: its steady routine and its exigencies, the profane dreams and the clean sheets, the bittersweet flow of days and years, mad and sane, troubled or peaceful, all its variation and endless possibility.
I get this a lot, because apparently my neutral facial expression is one of intense anger. Perhaps it's a hint of what lurks just under the surface, because every time some random stranger (and 99% of the time it's a man) tells me to smile, I want to punch them in the face. And not because they're inconveniencing me personally in any way, but because if they're the sort of person who feels the need to tell random unhappy-looking strangers to smile and be happy, eventually they're going to say it to someone who has a very legitimate reason NOT to smile.
The term “Riverbend” means what it designates -- the river bends, and what was up ahead well -- it was just as well we were not aware of what was coming.
Lately I have been pretty obsessed with an American reality television show, called “The Voice”. Unlike American Idol, it starts off vocal auditions for the show with the judge’s back turned towards the contestants so that people are picked based on their vocal chops, not what they look like, or their marketability. Unlike American Idol it also seems to allow people of all ages compete, and doesn’t cut off contestants at 28. The idea is that talent doesn’t stop when you cross some invisible line, where you become too old to break into the business.

Now picture a mountain of incinerated trash, 12 million tons of what was once a toxic heap of rotting fish and vegetables, old clothes, broken furniture, diapers and all manner of discarded items." This describes a new project by architect Tadao Ando called the Sea Forest. The Sea Forest "will transform 88 hectares of reclaimed land, a 30-meter deep mound of alternating layers of landfill, into a dense forest of nearly half a million trees" in Tokyo Bay. Ando adds that it is also an experiment in climate-engineering, or weather control as the future of urban design: "not only will [the forest] become a refreshing retreat for stressed out city workers, it will also create a cool ocean breeze to sweep through the capital and cool its sweaty denizens in summer."

What it’s about: When Edie’s mother receives a letter from Juniper Blythe, it arrives almost fifty years too late. Juniper’s letter is one of a few that got lost in the mail during World War II, and only now have the letters been delivered through a quirk in the postal service. But Edie is surprised to see her mother’s strong reaction when she opens the letter, and even more surprised to learn who Juniper is. Edie discovers that her mother spent part of the war in the countryside, taken into Milderhurst Castle by the three Sisters Blythe. Glimpsing this hidden chapter of her mother’s life, Edie becomes obsessed with learning more about the castle and the sisters, especially when she discovers who their father is—Raymond Blythe, author of the children’s classic The Mud Man, the story that first got Edie interested in writing and set her on the path to becoming an editor. As Edie meets the sisters, she begins to discover secrets long buried, about her mother, the sisters, the castle, and the origins of The Mud Man.

BFF Rachel and I had such an amazing trip: we toured famous sites, wandered through quaint cities, nibbled on croissants and sipped espresso (or beer) at streetside cafes, and partied into the wee hours at fun Parisian bars with fun Parisian folks. Oh, and stared at the ridiculously attractive French men. Le sigh. But alas, this is a food blog, so I will be blogging over the course of the next few posts about some of the amazing food we had during our 8 day adventure.

The doubts that had arisen from his past leadership blunders were completely erased. He would forever be known as the last faithful patriarch and worthy successor of the mighty prophet Moses. This victory was a life-altering moment for Joshua – even Yahweh recognized this and chose to follow his lead.

Each year Anna (and Abigail) are given one small gift that was bought in her homeland. Scott and I did buy a lot of things in China with this occasion in mind back in 2004 but he was able to sort of "restock" our Chinese New Year gifts when he went back to China for the CT Education trip last spring.
Around here, we transform things. I decided to make it a desk and save the broken mirror for another project.

Garter belt is suspenders, suspenders are called braces, pants are trousers and underwear is pants. A vest is a waistcoat, an undershirt is a vest! Vagina is fanny and a fanny is your butt. Your butt is a bum there (I’m not being crude, this needs to be known because when you go around England with your “fanny pack” you will know why Brits break out in laughter-you’re welcome!). See what I mean? Very confusing. I have actually logged hundreds of words that differed from the ones that I used as I needed to understand it to be able to function in society. There were several times I was very embarrassed (see my blog Have I Got News For You). I used the word toss at work and everyone started laughing. I was finally told it means that someone is pleasuring themselves. If I went into a store to buy something and said to the cashier, “I have a tweny”, the response would be “Sorry? I didn’t understand.” That’s because we Americans do not use our Ts. Why don’t we say twenTy? No idea. I also told someone I was self-sufficient which brought tears and laughter to my husband who told me later that I had announced that I grow my own vegetables and live off the land!

Malema has made regular public assertions that there are “agents” and other forces that he believes are determined to sink him. If he genuinely believes that any difference of opinion with his own is the work of a harmful external force, he need never take any genuine notice of the opinions of those others. This is a foolproof narcissistic defence: those who don’t agree are jealous or mischievous, hence we need never consider the content of their criticisms of us.
Sighing when there seems too much to do, sighing when there seems too little to do, frightened of speaking the words from your heart, frightened of speaking to someone unknown, arguing with those who view something differently, arguing with those who try to stop you expressing yourself.
Endurance; fantastic,
My ability to love is hindered by the fear of my mortality. My will is stultified by my lack of love; I’ve been extending myself in every which direction but towards a functioning center, living on the periphery of life where all of the noise and activity can keep me company. There is no overflow of spirit left to do anything creative since it is all being spent, eaten up by the products of friction, and so I am an automaton.

I'm back to the grind after a wonderful week away in Canada, visiting my dear family. I'll take any excuse to visit my precious little niece, and since it happened to be her first birthday this past week, I couldn't possibly stay away! My sister-in-law, designer and owner of Sugar! Wedding Cakes didn't disappoint, and the party she put together was full of personal touches that honored her darling daughter.
Oh how we loved Dead Poets Society. Partly it was probably the cute boys. Partly it was that it was funny in parts, sad in parts. But, I think mostly it just touched us. It made us cry. It made us think. It made us feel. Even today... I watched this, and I cried.
How it works
Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, He confirmed it with an oath. God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.

She leaned forward and kissed it, running her tongue along its length. He growled and crushed her to him, his hands running up and down her back. She didn’t know what to do with all the sensations coursing through her. His skin was so warm against her hands as she ran them along his shoulder blades. He smelled of leather and cedar and soap, and his lips were everywhere… on her own, at her ear, down her neck. She suddenly pulled back from him. “Wait… wait. I need to ask you something.”
If you’ve noticed, I’ve recently tried to do a monthly divination forecast on me as an experiment – to see how pertinent it is to my practice.
I had been interested in writing for a long time. As a pastor and teacher I spend a lot of time writing lessons that I am teaching, so writing as a discipline was something I did all the time. A few years ago I wrote a book on ministry called Visible, Vibrant, & Vital. It was work but really just an extension of what I did each week in preparing to teach. I also wrote some articles regularly related to preaching, researching, and teaching that I enjoyed. Those efforts were my first real attempt at writing for publication.
He IS perfect. He doesn’t ask us to be. He knows that we will fall short. As humans, we have the ability to use our free will. We will fail, lose, screw up, and feel downtrodden. That’s the beauty of it all, though! God accepts us no matter how GOOD we are, or how BAD we do at something. We are all his children, and as long as we have a relationship with Him, then that is all that matters. Truly, he treats us like a father and accepts us no matter what. Psalm 73:26 says:
Turns out that making dinner from what’s in the house is a great way to clear out the fridge. Duh. I know lots of people do this I’m just not those people. I made pasta with pink sauce. It should have been pinker than it was but one of the creams wandering around in the fridge turned out to be rock solid. I used bacon, leftover shallot, parsley and 1/2 a red onion, sun dried tomatoes (which must have been at least a year old), garlic, chicken stock, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. It tasted good and was on the table fast.

Some of you may have seen that 2012 Upper Deck football has College Mascot patch cards that come 4-per-case. One of the mascots they chose was the HokieBird. Like I said...perfect fit for my collection. Fortunately, the HokieBird is a 1:99 packs Mascot, and not one of the super rare 1:7,000 packs Mascots. I was able to get mine for around $13 shipped. Believe it or not, that's the third most I've ever spent on a single card.

Luther was able to continue much of his other life work, though it paled in comparison to royally pissing off the entire Catholic Church. He made a little money doing some free-lance translations and sticking his nose into the Peasants’ War of 1524-1526, where he supported the peasants’ political demands while repudiating their theological arguments, a fine distinction that was lost on all the people who had swords. He married a former nun, a widely acknowledged hottie by the name of Katharina von Bora, and continued his writing as his influence spread across northern and eastern Europe.

One more thing, I have a quilt kit and I can't find the pattern. It is call Curved Log Cabin, and if anyone happens to have a pattern they can share with me I would be eternally grateful! This is what happens to me when I don't immediately work on a quilt that I purchase!!
There will be no future, I am saying finally, without war, poverty, Malthusian panic, tyranny, cruelty, classes, dead time, and all the ills the flesh is heir to, because there will be no future; only a present in which the left (always embattled and marginalized, always—proudly—a thing of the past) struggles to assemble the ‘material for a society’ Nietzsche thought had vanished from the earth. And this is a recipe for politics, not quietism—a left that can look the world in the face.

OK back to the big venture out. There are actually 2 trips I made to TRU with the first one being last week. The package this gift came in was a blister pack - you know that super industrial plastic that you have to cut with superman scissors and then carefully remove the toy so the sharp plastic doesn't slit your wrists? My point it - this thing was SEALED. It has a TRU security device thing on it with Toys R Us CLEARLY stamped on it. It was obvious it came from their store. Oh - and it was the combo gift kit so it wasn't $20 but more like $50 as it had 3 separate games to it.
Now, I am not talking about discovering a cure for a disease or saving someone’s life; I am talking about things that I have done that I poke my chest out about because it was meaningful to my life. I may not have moved the world, but I moved my world. I will name a few.

As we know, that is the old covenant mindset of the Jews who mistakenly thought God was separate from them and had a distorted image of an angry and judgmental god. Maybe that is part of the reason a number of christians sound confusing and incoherent in their posts in Yahoo Answers as atheists are pointing out from time to time – since he happened to believe in a schizophrenic kind of god and so his posts don’t really make sense in the end. We used to come from that kind of evangelical background so we can roughly understand this is where these guys would be coming from if they don’t question the doctrines or dogma of their own institutional churches.

The time for the appointment came around. The receptionist was lovely. I hardly even waited five minutes before I was called in. The dentist was a lovely, tiny lady. I told her that my tooth had broken, that I had panicked at first, but as the week passed and it didn't hurt, and I didn't cut my tongue or cheek on the sharp bit, I had come to the conclusion that it wasn't too drastic. She had a look. In 20 seconds she knew exactly what she was going to do. I could see her mind processing so efficiently. She told me she was filling it in, and applied the anaesthetic with much reassurance and soothing. She worked quickly and confidently and kept telling me I was doing well. The whole procedure, four layers of the filling and polishing it up, took no more than twenty minutes. I told her my secret to being a good dental patient. Here it is. Imagine a world without dentists.

Liz feels she must deal with raising their daughter, who tells her own reactions to her parents' strife as she works on a tape to enter in a music contest, blending Tibetan chants with the "Salve Regina," and she finds herself soon living with a father who's does not stay at night at home, but in a sleeping bag at the temple. I felt her character needed more elaboration, and given Donovan was a long-time teacher, Anne-Marie's school settings appeared very underdrawn and dull, but that's a minor point in a very solid storyline. Maybe they reflect the girl's reaction towards school but she's meant to be a good student, so her seeming lack of attention to her environment and the comparatively little time devoted in the book to her studies puzzled me.
How is the rake attributed to gamers? – Websites use various methods of identifying how a lot of the rake is applied to each player.

Shane is near death after crashing her car on a long stretch of empty highway in rural New Mexico when she is miraculously saved by a mysterious young man who walks out of nowhere. She feels an instant energy between them, both a warmth that fills her soul and a tingle that makes her shiver. But who, or what, is he? For the first time in her life, she believes in the term "soul mates"—Travis is her destiny, and she is his. But she soon discovers that Travis is dead and strict rules govern kindred spirits of different dimensions. Even a kiss could destroy both their souls. And while Travis is almost impossible to resist, temptation proves to be the kindest enemy they encounter.
Anne looked at me like I was losing my mind.

I think it’s a tie between Audrey Lucas from Audrey’s Door, and Lois Larkin from The Missing. Both had very dark sides, and I sympathized with both.

And that part of it made me really happy. I’ve been blessed to meet and talk with astronauts from the early days of spaceflight, and the reality is, there’s a limit to how much longer we’ll be able to hear their stories first-hand. Since I began working on “Homesteading Space,” I’ve always felt a responsibility that, when it’s no longer possible to talk to them directly, the best thing people will be able to do is talk to the people who talked to them, and that I have a duty to carry those stories. These kids will likely never get to talk to Buzz directly, but it made me happy that they could talk to Buzz by proxy. (And I felt like, in places, I was a pretty decent Buzz — when a kid asked if I was the second man to walk on the moon, I responded that “Neil and I were the first men to land on the moon,” a fairly accurate Buzz response, in my opinion.)

Bede’s superior, Abbot Ceolfrith of the Jarrow monastery, responded volubly, subsequently sending architects to Nechtan to assist in his nationwide reform. They helped build the first Peterkirks, revolutionary buildings in stone named, like the citadel in Rome, after the first apostle of the Roman Christian mission. They served to create another schism with Iona, whose missions were rustic, country constructions of earth and rubble.

David Freud’s history is interesting: he previously worked as a journalist for the Financial Times and then joined a leading UK investment bank (UBS investment banking), where he was on record as saying to his deputy: “If the rest of the country knew what we were being paid, there would be tumbrels on the streets and heads carried round on pikes”. In his city career he frequently got things seriously wrong. As one reviewer of his book put it, Freud “will be remembered in the City as one of the key players in several of the most embarrassing and badly managed deals in investment banking”. His revenue forecasts were, in his own words: “completely potty”; according to the Daily Telegraph, his financial plans for Euro Disney “went so goofy they almost wrecked his career” and on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link he got his sums wrong by £1.2 billion and had to be bailed out by the Government (www.variant.org.uk/events/Doc7Poverty/BankerBankies.pdf ).
Christ is no longer the daily companion to His friends as he was prior to the Resurrection. Mary Magdalene reaches out to grasp His hand and He tells her not to. He wants her to understand that He is not the same Jesus that He was a few days ago. To touch His hand would now be a familiar gesture. He permits some contact but in a reverential context. Women touch His feet in worship. He allows the disciples to touch Him to confirm their faith and understand that He is alive again in human, not spirit, form. However, He will no longer appear to them regularly. He needs to wean them off seeing Him every day, for He will soon be joining His Father in Heaven.
It is always something we talk about at the beginning of the Christmas season- where are we going to display the cards this year?

What doesn’t work: constant repetition of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behavior. Relying on reason as a means of tamping down emotions, using repression, suppression, denial, avoidance, and distractions. Using emotion as a way to act out helplessness through panic, hiding from the world, isolation from family and friends, spiraling depression, victimization, and other negative emotional states that display a lot of action but never find an escape route.

Everything my mother owned was neatly boxed and stacked in a storage unit some miles from our home. We hoped to complete an addition to our home and see her settled with her own furniture and belongings soon, but construction was still underway and stalled by winter storms. For now, my mother’s privacy and few necessary possessions were confined to the guest room. One day, early in December, I went to the storage unit after helping Mama get settled at the dialysis facility. I climbed, searched, dug around, and finally located some of her treasured Christmas decorations, came home, and set them around our living room and her bedroom. Her happiness at discovering these when I brought her home that afternoon was a great boon for both of us.
Meaning that depression, that leads to serious unrepairable loss is common place in this society. And this is why that commercial drives me nuts.

The very few friends or family that you truly trust.

One final thing - in Sept the Antiques Roadshow is coming to Chatham dockyard (well the little bit that is a museum now) I intend to go along. I'm not a lover of the show but my Dad was awarded a watch in 1941 called the Coast watch. It was awarded every year to the boy from a Gillingham school who passed the entrance exam with the highest score who went on to become an apprentice shipwright. We have the watch which is engraved, an original cutting from the local paper about its presentation and also recently I unearthed my Dad's original apprentice indentures. I thought it might make an interesting artefact given all that and the relevance to the dockyard. He worked as master shipwright on the last O boats (submarines) made there as well. I have some photos of the launches I could take along too.

Top each filet with the sour cream-dill mixture and garnish with more fresh dill. Served with salad and couscous. The salad dressing I used was a Weight Watchers recipe that I’ve made before (on my old recipe blog.) I didn’t feel like dirtying the food processor, so I just stirred everything together and it came out fine. This dressing was PERFECT with this fish, since it uses a lot of the same ingredients.

But on the bad days I hate what I see. I see sun spots creeping up on the top of Mt. Baldy; I see spots and stains on slightly crooked teeth; I see flab where there once was muscle (as an aside, my first wife once told me that I had a washboard stomach - it just had three weeks of laundry piled up on top of it. I don't like her.) Sometimes feelings like that can send me to even darker places, places where I replay past regrets and mistakes, where I scorn my own actions and feelings as being inadequate for a man of my age and experience. Now, I never stay there long, and I truly do love my life and appreciate the blessings that I have. I also love the journey that I have taken to get to where I am, and I respect the choices I made and the mistakes I learned from. So really, it's all good.

When came home from our trip we were delighted to find our garden getting ready to break out in colorful flowers and hopeful buds. My husband said, “I love being able to design, plan and select plants of our own tastes and wishes, and not have to respond to anyone else’s dictated style of gardening.
When Katie and I first met, and after I had tricked her in to agreeing to become my girlfriend, she uttered ten words every male Doctor Who fan dreams of hearing from a girl, "I want you to teach me about old Doctor Who." I leant her some stories to watch on her own and Spearhead From Space was one of them. When I recently asked her to join me for this particular story she remembered it with, "Oh, I tried to watch that one but it was really boring" and then graciously agreed to watch anyway. She's not a complete stranger to Who at all and loved the new series before I met her (I swear I had no influence on that). I must admit, I love the experience of watching a classic Doctor Who story with someone who's never seen it before; it's my way of re-experiencing a story vicariously through another person.

America Movil, the cash cow of Slim’s business empire, said in a statement that it “was notified with a resolution issued by the Federal Competition Commission (Cofeco) that revoked and left without effect a 11.989 billion peso fine for alleged relative monopolistic practices.” The revocation of the fine could strengthen the view that regulators in Mexico lack enough muscle to reign in the massive influence of a businessmen like Slim, the world’s richest person, according to Forbes.

Suddenly she looked up and saw me staring. I then realized that to her eyes a slightly desperate looking beardy bloke was staring in growing excitement at her. I have never actually seen my presence cause a woman to suddenly look terrified. It wasn’t very nice. I wanted to quickly flick through the pages and point out my article, shouting “I WROTE THAT! THAT WAS ME! THAT'S ALL I’M LOOKING AT! PLEASE DON’T FEAR ME!”
Brioche is a favorite of my kids and a bread that is hard to find where I live so several years ago, I learned how to bake it myself with a lot of practice. I follow Ina Garten's recipe for brioche rolls and just make loaves out of it and let me tell ya, if you have a stand mixer, it isn't hard at all. It also freezes perfectly so I put a loaf in the freezer for later.

Oh my, what a lovely holiday. This is one day that is all about the food. No gifts to buy, just the company of family and friends. In my family, there are expectations for this day. They expect the same bird recipe with stuffing or dressing and mushroom gravy and the meal has to end with chocolate pecan pie and classic pecan pie. The sides are important but not as critical as the turkey, so I can get a little creative. This concept was tested one year when we spent T-Day at the Outer Banks. The beach was awesome, but the turkey was just OK. We ordered a turkey and my immediate family let me know that is not what they look forward to. I guess this is where tradition steps in and takes hold. I am good with that. This way the main dish has been tested and approved, so be it.
And the police just watch. Sometimes not even capable of hiding their scowls towards our Pro-Israel side . After all, they've just heard the buzz word "zionist" and "fascist". Guess all that CAIR Sensitivity Training is finally paying off (sarc intended)
My current obsession is my collection of personal journal/sketchbooks which I always alter...along with visual art, I love the written word - the books are 5"x8" so they travel with me whenever I go, I even broke down and purchased a purse which will accommodate the size in order to carry one with me at all times to pass the time waiting anywhere so that waiting is no longer a chore but rather a pleasure.
The first couple of evenings were spent drinking in, with poor choice from both Londis and Sainsbury's. Unfortunately the latter has got a small store in Tenby with an even smaller beer range, you certainly wont get your Punk fix here. Londis used to have quite a few bottles from local and interesting breweries, I had my first St. Austell Clouded Yellow from there, but the choice is not as good these days.

A subject has to meet several criteria. First, it has to be someone with whom I want to spend a lot of time, someone whose work interests me and has had a significant cultural impact. Second, there has to be sufficient source material. Third, and perhaps most importantly, I have to be able to find an angle that will interest young readers.

Those who paint a bloody picture of Bahrain have the responsibility to listen to other voices too. There are business motives behind holding the race, but certainly it is a proclamation that it is safe to hold such an international event in Bahrain. It could certainly attract global attention and gave the outside world an opportunity to witness what is originally happening in Bahrain.

Mary and Martha had the privilege of hosting Jesus in their home. Mary welcomed the Lord and his disciples inside and made sure everyone was comfortable before taking a seat near Jesus. She looked around, but didn’t see Martha. Probably in the kitchen. Mary thought of going to help, but who could look into those gentle eyes so filled with love and turn away? Who could leave Jesus while his words brightened dark places deep inside? What could be more important than catching and holding onto every word he spoke?
Those jaunts had been boring in a way, because his dad only frequented a few places—a bar downtown and his girlfriend’s apartment. But it got really exciting one night when his mom brought a gun and shot out the window in his girlfriend’s apartment. They had burned rubber getting out of that complex and Dylan never forgot the maniacal laughter that caused them to pull over and howl with merriment until tears streamed down both their faces.

It’s not unpleasant to drive either. Clutch action is light while the gearshift action has a firm and solid feel to it. It’s simple and straightforward to drive which is a big plus for people who do the daily grind in traffic. Despite it being marketed as a cheap run-around, it doesn’t feel like one and the refinement and build quality levels are impressive.
Hackett ensembles continued to record during the early 1960's, mainly for Columbia and Epic. In 1962, he joined Benny Goodman and participated in the band's 1963 recordings available on a 2-CD set re-mastered for the Yale University Music Library (vol 5) by MusicMasters. During fall of 1963 and summer of 1964 Bobby's band played in Hyannis, Yarmouth, and Dennis on Cape Cod. In 1965 he became the official accompanist for Tony Bennett, and they made two European tours ('65, '66). A favorite of vocalists, Bobby had earlier accompanied Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong (check out Rockin' Chair from the Armstrong Town Hall Concert), Frank Sinatra, Maxine Sullivan, and Lee Wiley. Also, in 1966, he traveled to Austin, Texas with Coleman Hawkins to attend a jazz festival featuring Hawkins. While in Texas, he made an LP with Jim Cullum's Happy Jazz Band (Happy Jazz Records), and in early 1967 a Hackett orchestra recorded some jazz favorites for Verve Records. In the late sixties he formed a quintet with Vic Dickenson, which spent much of the time on the road. Eventually he settled in at The Roosevelt Grill in NYC with a group that included Vic, Dave McKenna, Jack Lesberg, and Cliff Leeman. The group produced several albums on the Chiaroscura label: Live at The Roosevelt Grill, 1970. Also, during 1968 Bobby recorded with Billy Butterfield on the Verve label, and with the Hackett/ Dickenson Quintet on Project.

Wayne Gruden is a theologian, professor, and author of several books, but most widely known for his book on “Systematic Theology.” He admits upfront that he is not a political journalist, and that his approach is slanted from a conservative mindset. As a relatively trusted resource among evangelicals, I can understand why people would turn to him on such a subject, but one thing is clear, he is not an authority on political matters. He may even be overestimating his attempts by thinking his principles apply across cultures and party lines.
Because most Libertarians tend to be strong on federalism, they would argue that the federal government should be restricted to certain core activities such as defence and the central courts system while local or regional government would be much more free to be responsive to local needs and belief systems. Thus, under a Libertarian government in the US, for example, State and city legislatures would have responsibility for welfare, health, and local planning so that places like Texas could govern themselves unhindered by places like California.

Many of today’s older women entered (or re-entered) the workforce later than their partners following a period of non-work or part-time working while they raised their children. Consequently they may be at their peak with prospects ahead of them when men slow down and want out.

And the saddest thing I have heard today at the symposium was when an ex international politician was asked which political option is, in general, more likely to value the needs of people in conflict zones over the profit. The answer was very clear: “It does not matter at all. They will either play the game or lose the power – because the power of the war for profit is just too strong. It does not matter whom you vote.”

Last night I was watching Blood Diamond, and one of the lines that really struck me was, “TIA… this is Africa.” It was used when something awful happened or when an extremely idealistic person would try to create change. The attitude was basically, “this is Africa, it will always be this way, don’t waste your time with naive idealism, learn to look out for yourself.”
"The Problem of The Souvenir Cards"
I understand that sometimes, people are destitute. They need help, and they accept help from the state in order to feed their families. This is fine. It happens. I’m not against temporary aid helping those who truly need it. What I saw at Wal-Mart, however, was not temporary aid. I witnessed generations of families all relying on the state to buy food and other items. I literally witnessed mothers of small children asking their mothers if they could borrow their EBT cards. I once had a man show me his welfare card for an ID to buy alcohol. The man was from Massachusetts. Governor Michael Dukakis’ signature was on his welfare card. Dukakis’ last gubernatorial term ended in January of 1991. I was born in June of 1991. The man had been on welfare my entire life. That’s not how welfare was intended, but sadly, it is what it has become.
A democracy should allow previously repressed Islamists to take part in politics. These Islamists will strive to influence this democracy to further their views. But the system also changes the Islamists. Under the previous regimes, Islamist groups appealed to people simply by merit of their opposition to a dictator. In a democratic system the competition is different. Islamists will have to get elected to have influence, and since there will be no more resistance-against-dictatorship to boast, they need to present a revamped platform to be electable.
THAT IS LITERALLY THE REASON
Unfortunately my pictures, taken with an iPhone, do not do the piece justice but they will give you some idea. This video is of much better quality and it gives you a much better sense of what to expect.
Just look at the size of it now. That's one hardy specimen. There were lots of little babies as well that had sprouted from the suckers spreading out along the ground. I ripped those out, as I really don't want any more of this huge tree growing in the garden. While I'm happy enough to keep the old girl, I don't want any of her offspring.
And then finally we have the role of the church, that place where the devil hides under a cloak to deliberately mislead and twist the truth, that place where the cloaked devils support and protect the terrorists and help them to murder the innocent civilians in the streets, that place where they promote evil terrorist leaders to saints, just like they've been doing in SA for decades.
In the interview, he makes the argument for the indie bookseller and why consumers should shop their local bookstores instead of Amazon or one of the big chains. (Or, actually, the only big chain left.) It's interesting reading, and he makes some great points. I haven't read the book yet (though I plan to), but as far as his interview ... I don't agree with the activist approach.

Now in sole control of the civil tiltrotor program it had begun with Bell Helicopter Textron, AgustaWestland plans to begin certification flights of its renamed AW609 next year with the goal of obtaining FAA certification and begin deliveries by mid-2016. The company reports cash-backed orders in hand for some 70 units from 40 costumers in 15 countries. Two prototypes have been involved in initial flight tests. A third aircraft is being assembled in AgustaWestland Italian plants and will fly next year and it is to be followed by a fourth one in 2014.

My favourite thing about the outfit is this necklace. I found it in the COS sale and it makes the most awesome clackety noise when you run your fingers through it. My sister likens it to the braids that Monica in Friends had in that Barbados episode (I love that ep!) and I have to admit, the sound of the beads are pretty similar! Anyway, I'm pretty happy with my new purchase, it looks great tucked under the collar of the blouse.
I'm just after reading through my posts from late November to the one after I was discharged. Frightening as I can remember sitting there writing those words, I remember how badly I wanted to be dead. What I hadn't written though was that I had actually planned my suicide for December 10th. And the dress I was going to wear is still hanging up on the wall as a reminder. Scary stuff. And I am so very grateful to M and to Amanda who refused to give up on me. I am also grateful for your comments from the other side!

As I think about him this morning, I realize that there was more to Phroney’s life that we knew about. We knew very little about him, really, and what we didn’t know, I’m afraid we probably filled in some blanks badly, ala Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird. It is my hope, as I sit her, that Phroney, in fact, had a circle of friends around him at his distant house or maybe family of some kind who would share time with him.

Angie sent a message to Michael’s father asking him to pick Michael up at her house –since the doctor told her not to be out in the frigid air. She also asked if Michael could sleep in this morning since he’s sick. He finally responded ½ hour later, barely giving her time to get to his house – ‘Deliver Michael to his house by 8 a.m.’ Unbelievable! Then as she pulled out of the drive…there he was in the driveway! He had sent a message later…that arrived as she was pulling out of the driveway…that he would be there in a minute! Even more unbelievable! And it’s now been 4 months since he paid child support! They go back to court on the 24th! Please God….

Can all the English please die?" the Boer general asks as the English prepare to hike up the mountain from their camp. A lone Union Jack waves solemnly over the camp while a sea of Vierkleure (the old ZAR flag) decorates the hilltop. The British are outnumbered and the English commander just smiles and nods his head as a rendition of the famous De la Rey tune, sung by a Boere knaap, thunders over speakers.
There is a giant, pink, stuffed rabbit in my Spanish classroom. I got him from a garage sale for 50 cents a few years back, but he took off in popularity is a favorite in my classes this year. Heck if I know why. I suppose it's because he doesn't fit in any bin or storage container, so he's always just sitting out, staring at you.
I'm pissed that I'm about to lose another $200.00 worth of food that I just bought. Plus, my late ex-MIL was thawing. Over the summer, when I suspected that all the things going wrong was my ex-MIL's curse, Nurse Rudee suggested I write my MIL's on a piece of brown paperbag put it in water and freeze it. Which I promptly did and shortly there after, Duane got his disability, the boarder left, and I got a job. I grabbed up the container and went next door to the manager.

Oddly enough, I never thought about any of the females in my story as being “strong” or unusual. The positive reaction to the characters was definitely a reaction to all the stereotypical women in these kinds of books. People were genuinely surprised to reach such positive portrayals. The readers weren’t surprised that the women were strong and competent; they were surprised to see an accurate portrayal of themselves, their wives, their girlfriends, mothers, and sisters. Quite a few male friends have told me that they loved how certain female characters reminded them strongly of the women they love. Female fans have also shared how refreshing it was to see women doing the types of things they would do in the zombocalypse—like killing zombies.
The Professor Parent
J got an A on her English essay. The assignment was to write your own creation myth. I remember when she told me about this assignment. She worried about it having to be 3 pages. I thought she felt it was too much, but her next sentence was, "I don't think I could write less than 4 or 5." Again, this is coming from a kid who did her own thing as an unschooler for 6 years. That kind of freedom allowed her to build up a level of maturity and independence where now that she's in high school, she so enjoys putting 110% to everything. It's pretty cool to watch.

In fact the one thing religious extremists in Britain and Europe almost all have in common is their willingness to take money from the kuffir. Another tabloid regular, “Tottenham Ayatolla” Omar Bakri, sponged £275,000 in welfare, including a £31,000 Ford Galaxy people carrier to ferry around his seven children. And between them the July 21 bombers, who were admitted into Britain as refugees from war-torn east Africa, received £500,000 in welfare payments before repaying the British people by trying (and failing) to murder lots of innocents (who were only saved because the mastermind of the plots had been through the British state education system and so was incapable of doings the sums necessary to make a bomb).

To drink I could choose between two kinds of draught beer at Rabarbra: Frydenlund's bayer and Trondheim's own Dahls lager. I chose the local beer, and was given a half litre of a pale lager with a medium sized head and nearly no carbonation. In the nose there was flowers and some sweetness. In the mouth malts danced along with the sweetness and a hint of bitterness before the hops took over in the finish. Unfortunately the beer had a metallic taste as well, but perhaps the lines at Rabarbra were not clean enough? Dahls is an average lager that does its job nicely as a thirst quencher. It is not a beer I will actively seek out. But I would like to go back to Rabarbra.
This is what held up completing the room. I had been searching for one large wood bookcase to fill the wall to no avail. I ended up going back to my first choice (doesn’t this always happen?) which was the Liatorp as two of them together fit the wall perfectly. I love the beadboard detail and painted in this deep coral colour (pulled from the headboard fabric), I think it looks amazing.

Roasting really is one of the best ways to cook these vegetables. Because of their high carbohydrate content, the starches which act as energy storage units for the plant, undergo caramelization as they are cooked, turning them into sweet, crispy goodness.

Without question there is competition in the marketplace, not just between profit making enterprises but also in the not for profit sector, including churches. Our economic policy even encourages competition so there cannot be a monopoly, which is bad for consumers. Our anti-monopoly laws are designed to ensure that one company cannot have complete control over one sector of the market and charge whatever price it wants for its products, because customers would have no choice but to buy from that company. In a monopoly, customers would have to settle for mediocre products and services. Although the concept of competition has been abused and many have employed unethical and even sometimes illegal practices to top the competition or gain market dominance, competition can be a good thing.

So thank you to everyone who made this day possible, especially in light of yesterday’s blog about how I never win any contests. And thank you to Sandra. I’m so glad you found my blog and that you enjoyed it. Alaina Mabaso’s Blog readers are hereby encouraged to check out the humorous, easy-to-relate-to She Can’t Be Serious. And I will now follow through with seven things about myself.
Donald Glover is many things, a young emerging television star for his role on Community, a candidate to play Peter Parker in the next Spiderman installment, one of the hottest budding comedians…did you know he was a savage rapper? Childish Gambino is Glover’s stage-name and he dabbles in many different flows. Nerd Rap, Rap-Rock, Comedic Rhyming, you name it he spits it, and this Indie renaissance star on the rise does it well. On his latest 2010 EP I Am Just A Rapper, Glover raps over Neon Indian, Sleigh Bells, and Animal Collective to name a few. Have a listen to my favorite track “Bitch, Look At Me Now” in which the beat was provided by Grizzly Bear.
There’s your set up. Streep is one hell of an actress (for certain that is NOT a newsworthy statement). She does this role seemingly so well, and so easily, that you’re brimming with hate, you can’t wait for Andy to quit. You hope she’ll move on – to save her dignity, to save her relationship with her live-in boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of Entourage fame), and to find a job as a journalist which was what she wanted all along.

With the holidays behind us, work began by removing the trees ornaments, packing the lights and then cutting the tree, adding the pieces into the green recycle container. There is still more work ahead, at least a full days worth and in the meantime Ms K is was relaxing the couch, watching with eyes half open, the progress that was being made.
Ever since the school nurse told Alli that she was having some vision problems, Alli has over exaggerated her eye problems. In church I am the children's music director- and Alli would squint at me and my little pictures. At school, Alli sits up front- and she would overly squint and exaggerate. Whenever she'd watch TV, she would watch it totally normally...... until she saw I was looking at her, and then she'd squint. Faker.

While the stock of the great majority of large media firms is traded on the securities markets, approximately two-thirds of these companies are either closely held or still controlled by members of the originating family who retain large blocks of stock. This situation is changing as family ownership becomes diffused among larger numbers of heirs and the market opportunities for selling media properties continue to improve, but the persistence of family control is evident in the data shown in table I-Z. Also evident in the table is the enormous wealth possessed by the controlling families of the top media firms. For seven of the twenty-four, the market value of the media properties owned by the controlling families in the mid-I980s exceeded a billion dollars, and the median value was close to half a billion dollars. These control groups obviously have a special stake in the status quo by virtue of their wealth and their strategic position in one of the great institutions of society. And they exercise the power of this strategic position, if only by establishing the general aims of the company and choosing its top management.

It is interesting, as I received this message about an hour before Michigan lifted is limits on cyber charter schools – effectively opening up a whole new, practically unburdened market to K12, Inc. (though I don’t know enough about investing to know if the two are connected – granted some of the analysis articles on this website speak to potential limits of profit due to legislative restrictions, and also pending court action).
When my previous husband and I lived in Wolverhampton, on the day we moved in we were invited next door for drinks and were told in the nicest possible way that it was a tradition in the cul-de-sac that people only hung out their washing 'during business hours'. As we both worked during business hours, this made for difficulty. We solved it by hanging out washing in the space outside our back door, where we were overlooked by no-one. In fact these neighbours became great friends, but their whole lives were devoted to 'keeping up the standards.'
Society doesn’t need more people who can’t or won’t say they’re sorry, what it needs is more people who are in touch with their own fallibility, and who say they’re sorry and then mean it—i.e. try their darndest to not make the same mistake again, learn from the past, and become a better person for having made their honest amends. There’s something very dignified and noble and truly warrior-like about actually taking a searching and fearless moral inventory, and then making one’s amends, and continuing to refine and develop one’s conscience in a healthy and ennobling way.

I’m a Rock n’ Roll girl, I *heart* Country, Pop and Soul and Indian music too. My tastes can can be described mostly as old fashioned for a teenager and I’ll admit that I’m proud of it; Jim Reeves, Righteous Brothers, Neil Diamond, Conway Tweety, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, ABBA, Lionel Richie, Foreigners, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, Sting, Rod Stewart and The Beetles to name a few, 99.9% of my friends don’t know any of those awesome singers.
One caveat is we tend to over think the process. We spend inordinate amounts of time pondering how to do it, yet take no real action. A powerful message was relayed in that you have the ability to change peoples lives through action.

Everyone was having fun except for a little girl who was about three years old. She wore beautiful white dress and had big brown eyes. She stayed close to her big brother who was about seven. I felt compelled to do what I could to help her have fun, too. As I approached her she turned and buried her head into brothers chest. I reached up and grabbed a red balloon that had been positioned high on a tree and offered it to her. After a few fruitless minutes trying to convince her to receive the gift, she cautiously accepted the balloon.
Any now, I just gave myself stress... so I'm gonna hit the books again...

I’ve also since changed ‘ your’ in the third to last line to ‘our.’ So it seems more like the bondage is a passing whim and not something the narrator is obsessed with. Oh, and, again, I’ve gotten rid of the stanza breaks – that was purely to help me keep my place whilst composing. You can see the little rhyming dictionary I made for myself parallel to writing the poem above, too.

On Marriage
13th October has a large red circle around the date. And I’ll confess to being ever so slightly in a panic. About everything; the domestic arrangements and whether I’ll get it all done in time, the children, the animals, the housework (I haven’t nested like this since I was last pregnant.) Most of all it’s the thought of six hours of surgery and waking up in intensive care, and the long recovery. This is the biggest thing I’ve had over my thirty years with Behcets disease.
Yep, that’s me. I think I was about four or so. This photo is one of my very favorite personal possessions. I know this sounds silly but first of all it’s one of the very few photos I have of me as a little person and second of all, it reminds me of just how sassy I have always been.
While dating websites here let you to know a person, like them, have coffee, go for dinners, have sex, and maybe get married – all depending on just your choices and decisions, websites for our country have profiles made by parents or siblings asking for ‘tall fair slim Masters degree’ people for their kids or siblings to get (directly)married. When there is no choice but to marry some Tom, Dick or Harry, how is that marriage qualified to be a ‘choice’ marriage? Because you chose the best fit of the people shown to you because you could not say no to it at all?
Thoughts on the attachment issues: I watched a psychology class online yesterday that was discussing childhood attachment disorders. They had a few case studies they were referencing, so I looked those up too to make sure I could follow the class….the cases were amazing and terrifying. One little girl…maybe aged 6 or 7 talked with complete lack of emotion, about wanting to kill her “mommy and daddy” and her baby brother. When asked why she wanted to hurt them, she corrected the psychiatrist by saying, “no, I don’t want to just hurt them, I want them to die by me stabbing them.” …. oh my. Another case cited a child of 4 who could not be left alone with an animal, living or dead. He would dissect them, with whatever tools were handy (including his teeth) into piles of organs and flesh, alive or otherwise, didn’t matter to him one bit. ”It’s just a dog” He said in therapy. The psychiatrist asked him if he knew that it hurt the animals when they were alive and he said “well yeah, that’s why I’m doing it…duhhh.” I could go on, but I won’t.
But rather than walk away completely and find myself one day at that show Hoarders: Buried Alive or any other number of reality shows with a similar day I take a deep breath and find a spot to dig in. I can't say ever really want to get moving on the project but I am always pleased with the result and thankful the Lord gives us our homes for a respite from the chaos of this world!
The latest target killed was Zuhair al-Qaissi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza. IDF sources said he was responsible for the terrorist attack on the Egyptian border last August - which would make his killing an act of "deterrence or punishment." But to be on the safe side, it was also noted that he had "led and directed plans to carry out a terror attack within Israel, which was in its final stages of preparation."
In Protestant churches it is more common to use four red candles (reflecting their traditional use in Christmas decorations) because rose vestments and decorations are not commonly used in Protestant churches. Blue is also a popular alternative color for both Advent vestments and Advent candles, especially in some Anglican and Lutheran churches. This is in keeping with the liturgical seasons; blue means hope and waiting, which aligns with the seasonal meaning of Advent. Other variations of the Advent wreath add a white candle in the center to symbolize Christmas, sometimes known as the "Christ candle." It can be lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. White is the traditional festal color in the Western church. Four red candles with one white one is probably the most common arrangement in Protestant churches in Britain.
Alongside my sheet daydreams I've been tempted by yet another project. I think I'll keep this one in my notebook for a while as I'm starting too much right now and not getting anywhere with half of it. While my students were doing a bit of research in the library this week, I managed a quick flick through some magazines. I was completely drawn to the colourway and thick open rib of this blanket and immediately wanted one of my own.

At the risk of inspiring another of those ‘pitchforks and torches’ moments, may I offer the concept of the Group Family. No, I am not advocating the lifestyles of polygamous cults or kings with harems, although most would consider my thoughts just as radical. I’m referring to a voluntary adult enterprise, with each member investing his or her own set of resources, towards the goal of caring and working for each other and their children. Imagine that, a more highly evolved ‘sacred institution’ dedicated to the happiness and prosperity of it’s members. It’s like Freedom breeding freedom! What a concept!

In second place is Beyoncé. Yes, I know. Before the Festival started, I would have laughed in your face if you’d told me I was going to type those words, but it has happened. Despite not really knowing much about her music, I was vastly entertained by her Sunday headline set and I was entertained because she didn’t fall into the trap so many of her mega-star ( and I have to say American – sorry guys) peers fall into and kept it simple. No constant costume changes, no huge sets, no complicated Busby-Berkeley dance routines – a bit of glitz, sure, but just music. Glastonbury is all about music and the connection between the performer and the audience and Beyoncé seemed to understand this. The mix of songs was spot on, drawing on all her influences from funk to ballad, from R&B to soul. Glastonbury is not a place to plug your new album, it’s a place to display your best stuff and to convince people who are not necessarily your fans that you have worth and for me she did just that. Once again Glastonbury wove its magic and you could see the emotion, especially during final song ‘Halo’ where she had to stop to catch her breath. Beyoncé, you have a new fan.

This has a flavor like an IPA. The Summits give it a nice hoppy flavor, but it still hasn't dinged "tangerine" on my palate. It is pleasant whatever the case. Still, that was warm and flat. It is in the fridge now and ready for force carbonation. I have dubbed this one "Prince of Orange Pale".
But she's right. I need to tell it like it is. True, some people heavily in denial refuse to see what's there right in front of them no matter what, but most of the time, if you don't give them the whole story, you have to expect it will come back to you in a distorted form.
Our generation is fighting for Freedoms written into our Bill of Rights, which the so-called “Patriot Act” has diluted. 56% of Californians are in favor of Marriage Equality and yet, Marriage Equality is currently denied in California.

The immediate rational for lawyers operating in private enterprise mode is that it increases competition. The value of this to society is that competition reduces prices. However, judging by the offices of many law firms and the not inconsiderable compensation that many receive, this mechanism is creaking, to say the least.

Secondly, it is a sign of humility and a desire to learn as much as you possibly can so that you will be as effective as you can possibly be in your ministry. If we feel that we know everything that we need to then we are limiting ourselves and as such we are limiting how God is able to use us, we need to accept that we don’t know everything and that there is still so much more that we could learn. The Bible gives us a great example of this in Gehazi Elisha’s servant (mentee), who because of his own pride and assurance of his own knowledge acted in his own self-will which resulted in him suffering leprosy. This is a marked contrast from Elisha, who lovingly followed and learnt from Elijah and was given a double anointing of his spirit.

It didn't work, but Jimbo continues.

The show, called "IMPOSSIBLE PERSON-GUITARRING IRON CONFRONTATION," is currently in pre-production and Jimbo is getting laid, laid, laid and snorting shabu-shabu off the asses of fallen idoru.

Furumay's last film, The Homeless Student, had a generally fine cast but didn't quite work -- mostly because the actor playing the central character was way too old for the part and wasn't a strong enough performer to overcome this handicap. The twin heroines here, played by Riko Narumi (How To Become Myself) and Kii Kitano (BandAge), are closer to the right age and far more skilled. The film focuses, almost entirely, on these two girls, who initially meet in passing during a junior high kendo competition (where Kitano beats Narumi by a fluke) and then later wind up in the same high school.
As we age, the ability of the body to naturally maintain the correct levels of cholesterol diminishes. This leaves them prone to develop an imbalance in cholesterol levels in the blood. Hence, leading a healthy lifestyle from early years is advisable, so that even when one ages, the body systems are strong enough to help lead a healthy life.

Although they were brilliant, they were the kind of people who Lenin is reported to have referred to as "useful idiots." There were thousands of well-meaning people in the West who completely misunderstood the nature of communism. They were "useful" to the Soviets in that they created an idealistic, sympathetic lobby for a brutal, murderous regime. They were "idiots" in that their ideology blinded them to reality. They couldn't see that communism was built on bullets and repression, not bake sales and sing-alongs.

A UK hardback first edition/first impression of Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, published in 2005 by Faber. Now, this isn't the kind of novel I'd normally buy – not that it's any particular kind of novel, as in, it's not, say, a crime novel, or a science fiction novel – rather, it couldn't really be called a genre novel, and as I think we've established by now, it's genre novels – crime, science fiction, etc. – that I tend to go for. Although, having said all that (rather tortuously), Never Let Me Go does actually possess genre elements – in particular SF – concerned, as it is, with clones being bred to act as organ donors. In any case, that aside, Ishiguro is still an author I'm interested in, so when I saw this in the Lewes branch of charity shop Oxfam for less than three quid – ooh, look: I've left the price sticker on the back – I grabbed it, sharpish like.

5- Avielle Of Rhia by Dia Calhoun. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the book, but like Wildwood Dancing, the setting and costumes would make it worth it. I think the movie adaptation would be really interesting, especially with the Bretheren Of The Black Cloaks hanging around. Oh, and Avielle hiding after her home is attacked would make for an interesting movie. Come to think of it, it does have the possibility to be a better movie.

I thought it would be down to the Big Break Up with Stuart Hammond, but various gossip mags have told me that was October and she’s been off frolicking in the sun with a new chap since then- the (unfortunately named) events organiser James Nesbitt. Then, however, the boy and I discussed how much singing the songs you’d written about your ex again and again for months on end must suck. Like some kind of punishment. Or perhaps she was just having a down day. However, with five thousand people paying thirty quid a pop, you’d think she’d have something to smile about.

After nearly a month home from China, Connie is still home with the girls, while I have returned to 'work,' though my boss might argue with that description of my activities there - and rightfully so. My thoughts are rarely focused enough right now on my work topics to be as productive as I need to be. But I realize that with passage of time and the maturing of our new, larger family, I'll gradually begin to reacquaint myself with work. Austin is back in school and his geometry class is keeping both him and me more busy than it ought to. We actually had to develop a schedule just to keep up with the homework and special projects! The girls, well, let's just say that they keep Connie busier than we imagined and certainly more than any of us thought. She needs more of my help too.

I can tell you with absolute certainty that if you have felt this or if you even are feeling it right this very moment, that you are not alone. The reason I can say this with such certainty is that I feel it. I have felt it. And, guess what, just the other day, I heard a room full of people talking about how they feel it. Oh how freeing it was to hear that I wasn’t alone in my feelings, to realize that the enemy is predictable and therefore defeat-able.

“Teacher, I no can do.” Yes, you can. Attach the negative not to can ( to form cannot or can’t).

If ever there was a brat to deserve the Could You Kill A Child treatment (answer: yes), it's Noel Fisher's Danny. Danny is a classic Jack Ketchum villain. With no redeeming features and easy to hate, he makes it very easy for us to root for Ludlow. And he's backed up by an even more despicable, sleazy Tom Sizemore. Robert Englund pops up in a surprising cameo as a sheepish father. Red is brilliantly acted, even by the kids and dogs. Red is the exception to that one rule about kids and animals.
Turn the dough out onto your work surface and cut in half. Shape each half into a ball and wrap each ball in plastic. Freeze the dough for about 30 minutes until firm. You can freeze the dough, tightly wrapped, for up to a month at this point. Thaw overnight, still wrapped, in the refrigerator.

New Words: Booyoung calls her dad "Abonim" which is more formal than the regular word for father, "aboji" which is in turn more formal than "appa," the casual word for "dad". "Insa" is "greeting". "Yeogiyo" is "over here!" and is used to call waiters or waitresses in restaurants. "Mun" is "door". "Saramdeul" is "people".
That morning Alice sat at Misha’s bedside until noon. First on one side of the bed, then on the other. The room was utilitarian, fitted cupboards, a sink, the door to the toilet, a bare area of painted linoleum where a second bed had stood in which another patient had been lying. Some days ago the nurses had pushed him elsewhere, without giving any reasons. To some other place. The abrupt division of the final sentence, which we must assume is a feature of the German original, mimics the pauses in speech; an aural semi-colon adding a peculiar stress to the banality of the information it contains. It stands for Alice's experience in general.

I'd call the feeling I had upon finishing this book less Afterglow and more Aftermath. The goodreads blurb ends with "even more difficult to forget" and I find that very true. I find myself thinking about how any of us would survive the ordeals that Alex overcomes. The book is amazingly well-researched, the science feels very real. I love the way Alex grows from a spoiled, attitude-ridden teenager who fights with his mother into a mature adult, fighting to protect the people he loves.

Army patrols and checkpoints will be located and conducted, of necessity, in urban areas with large Muslim populations. Muslims being what they are, this will undoubtedly be seen as a war against all Muslims, the army laying siege to Muslims, an attempt to exterminate Muslims, or some combination thereof. In contrast, relations between the army and the British public must be expected to be largely peaceful. No conceivable British paramilitary would take the targeting of the army as an objective, not only, or even primarily, because it would be strategically idiotic, but because they will simply not countenance inflicting casualties on it. This does not mean that there will be no expressions of anger or frustration in the streets about actions the army might take, but that they are unlikely to turn to violence in either direction.

OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: I was awaiting “City of the Snakes” since the moment I finished “Hell’s Horizon”. I knew that the third book would be taking a time leap and would be featuring characters from both the previous books. After liking the weird but excellent start to the series, I was curious how the author planned to end the series and how would Capac and Jeery interact with each other and what would this mean for the City.

As I told this story to the Little Chef, he looked at me with a quizzical expression and said, “Louise, didn’t she know what you were capable of doing in the kitchen???” I laughed, cracking up to realize how well my nephew knows me and being glad that he has an appreciation for my baking even at his young age. While I tried to explain that sometimes you have to give people an opportunity to trust you and discover what you're capable of, he kept saying, “But that’s just crazy, I can’t believe she thought YOU might not be able to make brownies without a mix! It’s like asking Peter if he thought he might be able to draw a stick figure!” (His dad—my brother—is an incredible artist. And yes, he refers to his dad by his first name.)

Quirk Books sent me over a copy of Marshmallow Madness, by Shauna Sever, to review over a month ago (thanks). Last night, in a bit of a haze, I finally tried it out. The book is essentially a series of flavor variations on one or two basic recipes. Unlike some marshmallow recipes, there are no egg whites, and the base recipe relies almost entirely on sugar, corn syrup, and gelatin. For my 'mallows, I adapted Sever's maple-bacon recipe. Lacking bacon, I substituted cacao nibs for a more austere crunch.
i know this blog post is walking a fine line between being vindictive and being authentic. i really see it more as my cathy bates/towanda moment then anything else… of course, the irony of this whole thing is that i have no idea who she has shared my blog with in the past and who in our mutual circles will see this and figure out some things about her on their own…..but i guess that is the way the cookie crumbles. i do know from statcounter that last week someone in west palm beach spent almost two full days on my blog….i also know that someone in our social community --who has the same internet provider that statcounter captured -- basically quoted something from my blog back to me (un-weight related) within those same two days--- something i posted a little while ago and was seen by the west palm beach reader this last week. could be a coincidence. could be.
Curious to learn more about this weediest of wines, I recently spoke with a California vintner who makes it on the side. For obvious reasons, he didn’t want his real name used, so I will refer to him as “Bud.” He told me pot wine holds an important distinction: in his view, it is “the only truly original style of wine created in the New World.” Bud said he is just one of a number of winemakers on the Central Coast who are blending two of California’s most prized crops. The recipe for pot wine, such as it is, consists of dropping one pound of marijuana into a cask of fermenting wine, which yields about 1.5 grams of pot per bottle; the better the raw materials—grapes and dope—the better the wine.

When Rogers began his film career, the group took on Pat Brady (string bass), who brought with him his flair for comedy (Brady later starred as Rogers' sidekick in his popular 1951 television program). The group remained popular into the 1960s. In 2003, the Sons of the Pioneers was among the winners of the Golden Boot Award, along with actors Chris Alcaide, Kelo Henderson, Tommy Lee Jones, and Kris Kristofferson.

The point is, we all draw the line somewhere. It’s not necessarily wrong to make the decision as a parent that your kids won’t play violent video games. But don’t assume that this is enough to assure a mature emotional development. It is essential to understand the value of positive opposition. Guys wrestle. It’s not a sinful expression of hostility. It’s just something guys like to do. Getting in the way of that natural development has serious consequences. When I was a kid, we couldn’t play with toy guns. So we made guns out of sticks. We fought with toy swords. We found a way to express ourselves, and we didn’t grow up to be axe murderers.
As for decoration, that lamp over the kitchen table is the same lamp just about everybody else has. The tablecloth is oilcloth, which isn’t actually used by my generation but by the elderly here.

The curtain is of fabric from a local designer; our region is known for textiles.

Last Friday, for the first time, I graduated (transcended?) to a real yoga class. For 90 minutes, we breathed, we stretched, and we held our poses in silence. I had a more or less empty mind for once, hearing only the crackling of the wood-burning stove and the howling of the wind outside. The time passed quickly . . . or maybe not quickly, but it passed without my being conscious of counting it, or minding it, or ticking it away. I don’t remember thinking, not even once, that I wanted it to end so that I could move on to something else.

“In view of the menacing omnipresence of the state, radical thought seeks to create a realm of political activity that is free from the hold of the governing powers. This activity is always a form of “resistance,” of curbing state intervention or exposing the evils it tries to conceal. In contrast to liberal politics, which aims to check state authority from within the governmental system itself, radicals, who place no faith in the establishment, seek to challenge this system from the outside, to create a “political” sphere that is not subject to—and actively works to undermine—“politics” in its institutional sense.Such logic precludes any attempt to participate in the public process that shapes the state’s political and legal agendas. The radical approach is not interested in either creating a new order or rectifying the old one; its sole concern is the deconstruction and subversion of the status quo. Foucault, for example, asserted that the political was born out of “resistance to governmentality, the first uprising, the first wrestling.”Similarly, Jacques Ranciטre, one of the most quoted philosophers in this context, defined politics as a “disruption” of the police order.And, in the same anti-statist vein, Agamben says that “The novelty of the coming politics is that it will no longer be a struggle for the conquest or control of the State, but a struggle between the State and the non-State (humanity).”

For a self-published author, this offer by the Boulder store might actually have its rewards if an author has a book worthy of its readership, and a readership supportive enough to attend a book signing and stump up the cash for a signed copy, and an author happy in the knowledge their book will be stocked there as long as they also stump up the cash. AuthorHouse offered a deal like this for their authors using Waterstones and Borders, as part of their publishing packages, but frankly, this really is bottom of the barrel stuff if you are attempting to equate this with any semblance of what could be called distribution.

“—No,” said Ted, interrupting and upstart. “Fuck that. If you start some shit about “nigger” being used in books—and I’m not saying you don’t have your points—but if you complain about that, then you have to ban every book that used “chink” and “fag,” “dyke” and “spic,” “honky” and every other derogatory term. It’ll be Fahrenheit 451 up in this.”
Then came the Honorary Doctorate issue, preceded by the ridiculous “First Lady of Malaysia” crisis. Of course the fact that the ‘FLOM’ website had to be removed attests that this gossip was water-proof.

Trees and science fiction – must be Art Quilt Santa Fe. Betty Busby was the teacher this year. Her award-winning quilts are fabulous, as was her four-day workshop. She had us painting on silk, which I have done before without much success. This time was different. Betty encouraged us to relax and let the fabric and the paint take us on a journey. Once I let go of my expectations and allowed the end product be a surprise, I had a blast.

Meat in general is now centre stage in my diet and I probably eat steak at least three times a week (usually for breakfast); I love the protein hit I get from a good piece of beef and I am slowly widening the variety of meats I eat – saying that, I just can’t stand the taste of roast pork so that will not be making a reappearance, yuk!!
In about AD120 the Romans built the first bridge to cross the River Tyne at the place where Newcastle now stands. The bridge was called Pons Aelius or ‘Bridge of Aelius’, Aelius being the family name of Emperor Hadrian, who was responsible for the Roman wall built along Tyne-Solway Gap. The Romans built a fort to protect the river crossing which was at the foot of the Tyne Gorge. The fort was situated on rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge, on the site of the later Norman castle. Little else is known about the roman fort that existed there.
Apparently some illiterate racists are upset that an African American girl was cast to play Rue in the Hunger Games movie. To them, I say, I’m upset that a light brown girl was cast to play a character that was described as having dark brown skin. Damn Hollywood and it’s light brown washing! In the interest of full disclosure, I didn’t pick up on it that Rue was black when I first read the book. This was probably because it was really just a passing detail and I was on Vicodin when I read the book (recovering from surgery). But I guess this means that it’s not exactly fair that I’m calling them illiterate.

Some interesting points did come up. I suggested that bars should charge a premium for cask, which upset some: it's hard enough to sell already, was the general tenor, don't make it harder (to which I'd reply, you have to give the publican something for all the extra work!). Andy made a good point: if you're charging "normal" prices for a beer you can and want to drink more of over a longer time, well, that adds up fast.

She reached up and craned her snout over the side of the kitchen counter, licking furiously until she had sculpted the cake down to one half its size. One frenzied internet search later, we realized that the only likely effect was an upset stomach. She's only done this a couple times, and she seems to resort to these bad behaviors only when the prize is extra tasty. She's quite a gourmand. She did the same thing to a log of goat cheese I had sitting out for a salad, and another time she licked all the whipped cream off the top of a trifle.
Anyways, I love this nail color! I might be converted!

Their beers are Eisbocks. These are lager beers that are brewed and fermented, then the temperature of the beer is dropped so that the water in the beer freezes. Water and alcohol freeze at different temperatures; Alcohol has a lower freezing temp. when the water in the beer freezes, the water crystals are removed, there by concentrating the alcohol in the beer. There are many breweries in Germany that produce Eisbock Beers, but few acquire the 30-40% alcohol strength.
What I mean by this is that the idol role requires the incumbent not only to have song and dance skills, but also combat, hostage rescue, ship-to-ship assault/raiding, and space fighter piloting (basically, some kind of Mylene Jenius). These abilities must be held together by a high level of teamwork that overcomes the competitive nature of maintaining roster spots… as careers are short by design (because loss of appeal increases exponentially with age).

No more cluttered coat mess by the backdoor. Check. No more walking clear across the kitchen just to make a quick sandwich. Check. Extra storage space. Check. Easy peasy garbage access. Check.

I want ice cream but it's Good Friday. My mother pointed out that I am exempt if I want to be with all my disorders and diseases. But I declined. The point of the exemption is to make sure sick or weak people don't become more weak. Not so I can have ice cream.
So very very good. If this was the first time I'd seen them, I think I would have had a hypertrophic spazzmodic episode (Ed note: Not a real medical phenomenon). As it was the 3rd time in four years, I pretty much knew what we were going to get and still swooned. Wheee! The one drawback of the show was that I only had demonstrative fans on one side of me, the kind that jumped up and down, sang along to the call-and-response bits appropriately, etc. Otherwise, it was stand-very-still-and-applaud-sedately. Oh to be up front with the be-flowerpotted.

LESSON #4. Passions aren’t necessarily permanent. Oh, I do so love this one, because it makes me have to consciously check myself quite frequently. Stop me if this seems familiar (well actually don’t stop me, I hate being interrupted – just chuckle and nod.) You signed your daughter up for piano lessons, and she instantly took to them. She has learned quickly, and plays and practices so often that you fear she may be becoming obsessed. But she does seem to love it, and says that she loves it, and it’s what she wants to do forever. Her teacher suggests that she take more private lessons and get a better piano, and your daughter loves the idea. So many months and thousands of dollars later, she suddenly loses interest. She doesn’t want to play; she doesn’t want to go to lessons; and she doesn’t want to practice. In fact, she now watches Pokemon videos most of the day. And chances are, you ARE PISSED. You spent time, and money, and effort, and she said she wanted to do it, and why can’t she keep her commitment, dammit!!! Well, it’s not that she cannot keep her commitment – she would just rather do something else. And yet you may be angry, and disappointed . . . but please take pause. Something else caught her eye, a new pursuit, and new interest, a new PASSION. She has been encouraged to explore her passions, and she is doing just that. It may not be what we would prefer or choose, but it’s not OUR choice – it’s hers. Everything in life comes and goes – interests, passions, beliefs, friends, ideals, goals, dreams – and they will go when they go, regardless of the time or money we have spent acquiring them in the first place. My own passion for hockey and passion for dam building have come and gone for the most part, to the point where I can drop them for months and then return with gusto when I am ready – or not return at all, depending on my passion. Passions like piano, or golf, or other things that require practice to be good at, will also come and go. But part of the deal is that you cannot force someone to continue a passion, because to do so moves a passion into a resented obligation, thereby removing much of the joy and freedom of learning that accompanies it. Trust that just because they drop a passion now doesn’t mean that they will fail to develop skills like perseverance in the future. As a parent in these situations, I think you have a choice – you can force them to continue and thereby risk teaching them what passions ARE NOT, or you can take these opportunities to help your child through a decision making process that focuses on joy and desire. Remember the second part of the unschooling philosophy I mentioned earlier – providing children with the freedom to learn what, when, and how they want. For me, my passion to teach has never waned . . .it has morphed significantly in response to my own desires, dreams, and circumstances, and it has sometimes taken a back seat . . . but it has never disappeared. But what if it had disappeared? Would that mean that my life is over, meaningless, wasted? Of course not . . . it simply means that I have either chosen to focus on a different passion, or am maybe taking a little break. I try to look at changing passions, either at home, or at work, as opportunities to connect with my children or co-workers in different ways, as expansive rather than restrictive.
Now they say everything comes in threes. I am not really a superstitious person, but I have found some truth in this one. So I am wondering will there be a third for my blog?

You cannot compare Saint Petersburg to Moscow – at least I could not. They are completely different types of cities. The thing I thought was most interesting about Moscow was the remnants of Soviet past – it was not uncommon to see an old Soviet-style building next to a brand new facility or classic style architecture. This is not common in SPB. In case you are wondering if Red Square is really that impressive, yes it most definitely is! It is one of the coolest government squares that I have ever been to and it is breathtaking. I’m afraid we did not get to see Lenin – as we were standing in line during the 3 hours you can actually get into the memorial, Sean realized I had left my teddy bear in the hotel room (and we had checked out), so we raced back to the hotel to try and find him. Teddy bear I’ve owned since I was four years old is much more important than Lenin’s body in my book!

I think the Chief was right about one thing: the show really must go on. Our Seths are still thrashing inside us in an endless loop. I like to think our family is winning. But my brother and my sister and I rarely talk about it anymore--that would be as pointless as making a telephone call to say, "Kiwi, are you there?

This time of year, there are all kinds of things to keep us busy but one of the best I know is putting away the bounty from our summer's fruit and vegetable crops. Since I did not do any gardening this year, I can only thank my farmer's markets, produce stands and the generosity of neighbors. Mobile has an unusual climate, I mean, it is hot as Hades down here with a humidity level that is almost unbearable at times. I have often complained of not being able to grow tomatoes because of the hot, humid nights but one thing that does well is hot peppers, that is if you can keep them watered.

In this respect, the Court takes the view that, in the present case, the keywords, syntax, commands and combinations of commands, options, defaults and iterations consist of words, figures or mathematical concepts, considered in isolation, are not, as such, an intellectual creation of the author of that program. It is only through the choice, sequence and combination of those words, figures or mathematical concepts that the author expresses his creativity in an original manner. It is for the national court to ascertain whether the reproduction alleged in the main proceedings constitutes the expression of the intellectual creation of the author of the user manual for the computer program protected by copyright". This all seems fairly unremarkable; now it's up to the referring court to apply it.
The hot topic these days is teen suicide. Is it any wonder why there is an increase in our kids wanting to kill themselves? Is it any wonder why there is an increase of kids in their single digits expressing thoughts of suicide? Bullying is not just coming from parents; it’s coming from everywhere. The energy of bullying permeates across race, religion, class, ect.

Anderson's channelling of epic medieval romance is excellent. His portrayal of the elves and fairy, his reminder that iron is anathema to them, and the sense of timelessness and chaotic transistasis that the fair folk inhabit is rendered quite well, and helps to create a wonderful sense of atmosphere. Readers should expect lots of magic, enchantment, monsters, spellbound castles, alluring sorceresses, and lots of other staples of romantic medieval adventure.

The preaching part of the service was over and our prayer sheets were being passed out. I had been fine throughout the whole service but towards the end, I had begun to notice some serious heartburn. I had had a lot of terrible heartburn with Colt, so this should have come at no surprise. But, for whatever reason, this heartburn with Gideon just brought my whole world to a halt.

The social contract and building of the time capsule in iMovie best demonstrate the create fluency because the students had to create a product from scratch. On purpose I did not give the students examples of social contracts because I wanted to see what they could create on their own. I did have some that went in search of examples on the internet and thus created their contract in the “first party” and “second party” format. I was pleasantly surprised to receive numerous original contracts simply stating the student’s name and then listed their responsibilities. I did encourage the students to be as specific as possible because I told them it would be difficult for them to hold each other accountable if there were obvious loopholes in the contract. I do believe a “social contract” is an essential portion of a group project because I have had only one issue so far with team members not completing their part of the research. However, I did not have to get involved because they solved the issue within the team and were able to work it out. Building the iMovie of the project probably forced the most creativity out of the students because I showed them a short example of what I was looking for but left the parameters pretty wide open because I wanted to see how original each team could be with their product.

People who know of my situation are usually appalled, but also many have questions and/or advice. All of it is well meaning, but none of it changes the facts….so let me get some things out of the way.
My dad told me that their pizza is crazy good, so that’s what we both ordered. I rolled with the Verdure al Forno, which had roasted mushrooms and red peppers, olives, and oregano (I asked for no cheese), and my dad had the Bianca, which had fig jam, goat cheese, mozzarella, arugula, and truffle oil.
About six weeks ago I put a pair of JBL bass bins on Ebay. We'd bought them for a PA rig, but hadn't enough funds or work to complete the project. Chris' VAT was due, so we reluctantly put them up for sale on a "Buy it now" for £800.

I’m really not optimistic about our future involvement in Afghanistan. There were stories yesterday of attacks against US and foreign troops by Afghan soldiers and police being underreported which me wonder how much we’re really wanted there and how far the Afghan soldiers can be trusted. Then, barely hours after the president said we’ve broken the Tabliban’s momentum, the Tabliban claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed seven and wounded 17 children on their way to school.
You can amplify your voice through different mediums as artists have chosen to through a canvas. Taking the form of paint, ink, or oil, art has been used by many to convey an underlying message. Richard Harris spent the past 30 years collecting prints representing war, which have been put together in the Chicago Cultural Center’s exhibit hall, “The War Room.” When I visited the exhibit yesterday, one particular print series stood out to me. Sandow Birk’s The Depravities of War (2007) displays the real victims of the U.S. invasion of Iraq: the Iraqi civilians suffering under the occupation. His print series serve to give a bold and upfront depiction of the realities behind the “liberation” process.Below I have depicted a few prints that I instantly recognized were scenes from the Abu Ghraib Prison where Iraqi prisoners suffered inhumane conditions by U.S. soldiers.There are several scenes in the print above that can be matched by the real pictures below.

I was asking my brothers if they felt the same way about their hair and, of course, they did not. My younger brother does apply some blonde streaks to his black hair from time to time but it is more of a show-off thing rather than a control thing. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the socially accepted concept of feminine beauty appears to be directly related to none other than a woman’s hair. I heard a group of guys talk about how pretty one of my female classmates’ hair was and one of them said in a loud, obnoxious voice, “Well, that’s what she uses to flirt and play around.” Not cool, bro, not cool.
This book is pretty much what you’d expect from a novella. It’s a really short story that rushes along the romance and storyline. It kind of leaves the reader feeling unfulfilled by the end of the story. This book wasn’t any different.

As I mentioned on yesterday’s blog, I’ve been spending time playing a late promo copy of Yakuza: Dead Souls for review for 7BitArcade, and it’s about this and its subject matter that I write tonight. Dead Souls is a spin-off of the Japanese game series Yakuza, which mostly revolves around playing a gangster who spends equal amounts of time time beating down perps and playing pachinko machines. It’s an offshoot in that the normally constrained universe of the game’s Japanese city has been invaded by a zombie infection and the town is divided into quarantined and inhabited zones – meaning your gangster spends time shooting the undead in the face…and playing pachinko machines.
Enough chatting, let's get on with the cards!
My fingers have been itching for a long time now, to type some words about ‘Bomber’ Robert McBride. I’ve noticed on Saturday that his name featured prominently in the headlines and front pages of almost every newspaper in South Africa. Although it gives me great pleasure to see how this gangster’s status has finally fallen, and that it is now legally justifiable to refer to him as a Murderer and a Criminal, it is also disappointing and frustrating to see how he, like so many other communist hero’s in South Africa, have succeeded in getting away with cold-blooded murder.
However some years ago, well before I began my 5-year project, things began to change for me. I bought a pair of smart black shoes that I didn’t really need. I bought them because I liked them.

When I think about those personalities and interactions, I always see Groves as one (or several) of my math teachers. He’s the kind of guy who’d give you zero credit on a quiz or homework for making a simple mistake in your number manipulation when you had successfully defined the problem and attacked it with the proper solution. On an infinitely more significant playing field than a school math class, here were the greatest geniuses of the age, solving a problem which had never been addressed, which was possibly unsolvable, and his input to the process of saving the world from the NAZIs is to correct their arithmetic and complain about their undisciplined work habits.

The Haunting unravels not just as a haunted house yarn, but a detailed character study. Eleanor is a fascinating, wonderfully layered character. In any other film, she’d be the hysterical, nervous wreck like Barbara in Night of the Living Dead or Veronica Cartwright in Alien. As she is our way into the story and we’re privy to her thoughts, she’s immediately signalled as the protagonist; and a compelling, unconventional one at that. While she is obviously fraught, over emotional and easily unnerved, she is also strong willed. Eleanor has spent her adult life caring for her ill mother and has led a repressed, sheltered existence, longing for independence. This repression extends to her sexuality, and we learn that when she was young, she was plagued by a poltergeist. Given her pubescent age when this happened, the possible haunting becomes bound up in notions of traumatic sexual awakening, much like it did in The Exorcist and Poltergeist, with the onset of puberty and eventual sexual repression connected to the sinister occurrences. Internal monologue sheds more light on what makes her tick. She is uptight and neurotic, but she knows it and it fuels her need for acceptance. Her fondness for Dr Markway resembles a student-professor crush, highlighting her adolescent naivety. It’s interesting that when she realises he is married, things take a turn for the worse in the house, and her hope of a fresh start drastically dims.

Another quick note–when you first get the mop, wash it a few times with towels to get rid of a lot of the loose fuzzy threads off. They are cut in a factory and I’m sure there is a lot of thread fuzz floating around that the strings collect like a magnet (this is a GOOD thing because the dirt will collect to it also!).
For me, the shifting sands of the publishing industry have taken us to a subtle but noticeable change in recent months. It wasn’t too long ago we were all fiercely debating the moves by mainstream houses like Harlequin and Thomas Nelson into the realm of self-publishing services and imprints. Several more publishers have decided to travel down the same path over the past twelve months. Recently, the sands have shifted again, and the debate is now focusing on literary agents taking the plunge into both self-publishing services and ebook publishing imprints.

The words are simple to me: begrudgingly. Idyllic. But they are foreign to my students. Some might say that’s bad. They might roll their eyes and say that’s what’s wrong with kids these days, too busy texting and Tweeting to bother learning the English language. Damn kids and their rock music! But I relished those moments. My students believe, or seem to, that I will know how to say the words they don’t know. They have faith in me, as their teacher, that I will hold the answers to their questions. And so when I whispered to them the correct pronunciation, I wasn’t annoyed or saddened; I was overjoyed. I was comforted. I was validated.

When we focus on our relationship with our children, instead of on their relationship with food; when we explore life, and food, along side of them as partners, we are available as a resource and a support system. When we have a relationship built on trust and connection, our children know that they can come to us and discuss their thoughts and ideas without being judged, criticized or shamed. When we can let go of our expectations our children are free to express what foods they like or do not like without fears of disappointing us or being forced to eat something.
