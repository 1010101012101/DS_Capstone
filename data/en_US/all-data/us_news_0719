Thus, state officials should proceed cautiously, acting only if they conclude that ineptitude, fiscal mismanagement and, possibly, corruption are beyond the ability of a local school board to remedy. The state should recognize that it will not be a savior. It should realize that what counts most is governance that provides children with a solid foundation on which to build a meaningful educational future, a system that helps families reinforce learning outside the classroom. Otherwise, Cleveland's public schools will suffer more of the same.

Sometimes when you 77 pitches, give up six runs (three earned) in less than four full innings of work, making fun of yourself is the best medicine.

But here all you have to do is drive up, plunk down a coin, get towel, soap, and suit, if you haven't brought one, and dive off. You can be sure the suit has been steamed and properly dried before you got it. No dirt, no noise, no slopping around a filthy dressing-room where uncouth voices yell "Hey locker!"

After my visit to the seed farm, I headed for brunch at a local favorite, OD's Kitchen on Martin Street just off Monterey, and it didn't disappoint.

"SNL" has always struggled with its Obama impersonation because Obama is "smooth without big handles," as Downey puts it.

• The Heat players acknowledged Anthony's greatness afterward, even if those compliments doubled as dig against the Knicks, The Wall Street Journal's Kevin Clark explained: "After the game, Wade complimented the Knicks star with a statement that doubles as unintentional comedy: "Their one great player played great," Wade said, and that's exactly the problem.

Even when I was in the game we didn't have any flow,' Anthony said. 'This is, for the first time in a long time, that I have seen that in our offense.'"

"So it's going to be a lot more of the same, but I think we just need to create more on our own instead of trying to look for stuff. We've got to fight through more checks. We've got to get me and (David Perron) to go in those hard areas in front of the net and all three work together. The last game (against San Jose), we got a lot more chances and that was a big step for our line."

Jazz people like to brag that their idiom is "America's classical music." But if you catch some of them in a certain mood, you'll find that they long to merge their art with what much of the Western world calls "classical music" — the idiom that gave you Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, etc. The reverse is also true — classical musicians who want to get down with the jazz folk, to learn their freewheeling ways or merely steal a few licks and vamps for their own purposes.
Matheny said the club can play with a short bench now because starters have gone deep enough into games to limit the use of pinch hitters and there are two off days bracketing the upcoming series against Milwaukee.

Boeing points to design changes both inside and out of the cabin that make for a better ride.

Because the House and the Senate can only vote a "conference report" up or down, as a single package -- no tweaks allowed -- legislators of both parties could claim they had to go along with the gas tax increase or there would be no highway work at all done in Ohio in 1989 and 1990.

False. Topical steroid creams failed to reduce sunburn severity when applied 6 or 23 hours after exposure in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial. Pain and redness can take 24 hours to peak and the skin may take several more days to heal. Applying a cool, wet cloth, or soothing lotions like aloe vera may help with symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce pain and inflammation. Get medical care if a bad sunburn covers more than 15 percent of the body.

Season recap: The dark horse of the Class 3A tournament, Estrella Foothills, almost pulled off the upset in the state final. But a walk-off two-run home run in the ninth inning of the title game sent Lakeside Blue Ridge home a 8-6 winner. Estrella Foothills wasn't a favorite to reach the championship game, let alone be in a position to win the title in extra innings. The Goodyear team started only four seniors, didn't possess postseason experience, and its four top pitchers aren't seniors yet. Plus, Estrella Foothills hadn't reached a state semifinal in baseball until this season. But the team gained confidence down the stretch, winning 15 of its final 16 games and its region tournament. McCubbins, a fourth-year coach, and his staff guided their team to a 25-6 record this season.

There's no way he's ready to relinquish that type of control in his first job. What I think he is learning, again we did not hire an offensive coordinator because we didn't think the right person was there or the fit was right. But, I think now as he goes through this season, I don't expect him to change calling the game, but in all likelihood we'll hire an offensive coordinator next year because that frees the head coach up and his preparation and how he can prepare for the game during the week. A lot of the nuts and bolts that he's doing now, he can kick to somebody else and still oversee that, that's how I think it's going to. We'll sit down at the end of the season and evaluate that, he and I, but I kind of think that's where we're going to go with it."

The city is building $23 million worth of facilities, including an aquatics center, a universally accessible playground, three baseball fields, two soccer fields and a football field.

“I’ve tried to tell you guys all along that I thought we were eight deep. You have to have a vision of where guys can get to. Fortunately for me I’ve been doing it for 30 years in the league and I’ve seen good players, so I think I know what good players look like. Sometimes we don’t want to believe that and we want to have players play good right now. But the problem is they can’t play good right now; they have to develop. So the kids have been working really hard. They’ve bought into coaching. They’ve bought into hard coaching. They’re willing to take criticism and make corrections. They work extremely hard in practice, so the residual of all that is improvement and that’s what they’re doing, they’re getting better. They have certainly not arrived and you always have that fear as a coach that after a good game and you guys are all kissing their butts right now that they start thinking they’re good. Well, they’re not good. They had a solid game and so they’ve got a long way to go because I could sit here right now and give you 10 things that each player did poorly in the game and have to get better at.”

But both the Premier League and UEFA, the governing body for European competitions, are in the process of installing so-called "Fair Play" provisions to limit exactly the kind of exorbitant spending on talent that first Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich used to lift Chelsea, and more lately, the sheik has lavished on players at City. The billionaires' fantasy league stretching around the globe is about to change.

As many have said, the "Sunflower Goal." Being so new, it's hard to come up with anything more significant. Knowing what Timber Jim had set into motion, I'd picked up 40 sunflowers at lunch that day in an attempt to include as many people as possible who may not have been in the know. At first, standing on the MAX platform at Sunset TC, I was getting quite a few strange looks - what's this guy in a Timbers scarf doing with an armful of sunflowers? Then more people started coming onto the platform with flowers in hand. That's when I knew it was going to be big.

But the results have been mixed. Over the past five games, the Blazers (37-29) have outscored their opponent in the fourth quarter just twice -- in a home win over the Bobcats and in a commanding road victory at the Miami Heat. The biggest meltdown came in that road loss to the Bobcats as the Blazers blew a 10-point lead, missed critical free throws down the stretch and were outscored 33-22 in the pivotal fourth.
As now drafted, House Bill 1 gives the state Supreme Court, run 6-1 by Republicans, direct and sole jurisdiction over any legal tests of whether JobsOhio is constitutional. There's no necessary reason to expect the court to be unfair, but the more judges and more court levels that review a politically charged dispute -- and a JobsOhio challenge would be one -- the better.
Commissioners spent $40 million of taxpayer money to buy Ameritrust and remove asbestos from the 28-story office tower. The goal was to make way for a sparkling new county headquarters. Those plans got scrapped, and today the county is stuck with the empty building.

They'll tell you there's damage when there isn't. Rhonda LaNue, who co-owns Lyons Roofing in Phoenix, has this advice: If you see roofers working on a lot of your neighbors' homes - they usually post a sign in the front yard showing the name of the company they work for - chances are good that your roof has been hit. If no other nearby roofs suffered damage during the storm, be suspicious when anyone says yours did.
The city's traffic folks reviewed the setup after Road Rant passed along a complaint about travelers "dutifully" waiting for turning instructions at the intersection.

Houston first distinguished herself as a vocalist at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark. To those who saw her there as part of the congregation, singing hymns and spirituals, she was a girl next door blessed by God, and the inheritor of a distinguished New Hope gospel tradition that included her mother Cissy Houston, her cousins Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick, and her older relatives in the Drinkard Singers. Cissy Houston told the young Whitney that it was not mandatory that she take her gift to the record companies; she’d always have a home, and an enthusiastic audience, in church.
"But I think for years, the university has been hamstrung in not having enough clinical facilities to attract the very best physicians," said Brody, who was president of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore before moving to Salk in 2009.

With additional personnel, most likely. And additional funding. Both are near-taboo in these budgetary times. The record suggests lots of money is being wasted now in the name of vigilance. A promise -- to parents, especially -- is not being kept, and cannot be kept on the cheap.

Perhaps a trial will explain how his wrath settled on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the moderate third-term Democrat who was greeting constituents outside a grocery store when the gunfire began. Was this a political act -- albeit politics Americans prefer to associate with unstable countries? A twisted, John Hinckley-style bid for fame? An act of inchoate rage?
You don’t have to be near the water to offer good fish. In fact, Gary Simpson spent a year frying fish outside a shoe store on South Orange Avenue in Newark; when the shoe store became vacant, the former IBM sales representative opened Just Fish.

MOLINA ON THE MOVE I (2): Molina's two steals on Tuesday night made him the first catcher for the Cardinals to swipe two bases in a game since … he did it in 2005. The two-steal games tend to come in tandems. The two times before Molina's double steals that a Cardinals' catcher pulled off repeat thefts was Eli Marrero in 1998 and Marrero in 1997. Tim McCarver did it in 1967, twice. Mike Gonzalez did it in 1918, twice. According to researcher Tom Orf, here are the seven times since 1967 that a Cardinals catcher has stolen two bases in a game:

A key sticking point in negotiating the so-called strategic partnership agreement has been night raids spearheaded by U.S. forces. The insurgents stand to benefit from Karzai's efforts to curtail the raids, including a potential compromise that would give Afghan authorities greater control over who would be targeted.

The 0-0 draw was Timbers fourth draw in five preseason games, but they have yet to lose a game (1-0-4) during the preseason.

The voice actors get the material they deserve in a smart, spirited script credited to the director, Kelly Asbury, and no less than eight other writers (plus Shakespeare, who not only gets a screen credit but figures briefly in the proceedings and is voiced by Patrick Stewart). The soundtrack combines classic songs by Elton John with several new ones that he wrote with Bernie Taupin. The visuals, done by Starz Animation in Toronto, evoke some of the endearing tackiness of Aardman's "Wallace & Gromit" films. Still, the look is original, and appealing in its emphasis on the characters' fragility. Except for a very funny pink flamingo made of plastic (and voiced by Jim Cummings), these little plaster creatures will smash into pieces if they fall.

Does free-market capitalism prevail anywhere? Not by a long shot.

5. Make no mistake about it, in wake of Don Tony's retirement, Mozeliak is the boss now. And this rather maverick hire was the first move in Mozeliak's likely attempt to gather and consolidate power. I'm guessing we can expect other, um, "changes" as Mozeliak modernizes the family structure and takes it in a new direction. This past season the GM made the daring trades that became a significant factor in the Cardinals' magical run to the 11th World Series title in franchise history. Mozeliak accrued capital and now he's going to spend some of it -- and how. I mean, seriously now. How many GMs would be so bold as to replace La Russa, who managed over 5,000 major-league games, with someone that has managed zero games? Clearly the Cardinals organization will be what Mozeliak wants it to be. And you thought Mozeliak was quiet, somewhat conservative, a little bookish, and unassuming? It was a mistake to underestimate Mozeliak. Now that the tired Don Tony is going to be spending time in the tomato garden, Mozeliak has gone all Michael Corleone on us. He's settling all family business. And it starts with Matheny's appointment.

The Otomi-speaking people in Queretaro consider themselves descendants of the semi-nomadic Chichimecas of northern Mexico (and U.S. Southwest), dismissed by the Spanish colonists as barbarians. Tradition here is deeply rooted in the desert-like region's ecology and topography, which is dominated by the 1,150-foot Peña de Bernal, the world's third-largest monolith after the Rock of Gibraltar and Brazil's Sugarloaf Mountain. Pilgrims travel annually to a sacred triangle formed by the Zamorano and Frontón hills and the Bernal rock to pray for water and divine protection and to venerate their ancestors. Carrying crosses and other sacred symbols, they hike to a chapel about halfway up the rock. Their sense of guardianship of a sacred physical entity permeates the region's religious images, murals, dance and music.

DISADVANTAGES: Out of sight, out of mind! I always make sure to utilize under-the-bed storage for items that get infrequent use yet are extremely memorable because otherwise, they're as good as gone.
