Duvall brings crusty humor to his role, the Texas high country looks mighty inviting, and when was the last time you saw Melissa Leo in pigtails? (In a complete 180 from her potty-mouthed matriarch in The Fighter, Leo's character runs Utopia's diner and serves up a mean cherry pie. Her redheaded daughter, played by Deborah Ann Woll, invites the stranger to the square dance.)
Duh! Who knows? All we know at Starting Blocks is that it's great theater. Now sometimes, as with Jets' head coach Rex Ryan's hirsute and bepillowed impression of his twin brother, Browns defensive coordinator Rob, it's theater of the absurd. And sometimes, as with delusional wideout Braylon Edwards' assertion that he was disliked in Cleveland because he went to Michigan, it's just absurd theater.
Ryan Sweeney misplayed Jamey Carroll's single into a two-base error that put him at third with none out in that pivotal eighth, after the ball bounded down the right-field line, ricocheted off the padded facade of the seats in foul territory and skidded away.

But I've been observing this industry for too long to be absolutely convinced of that. I know that any competent hotel revenue manager would love to make every room totally nonrefundable, charge customers a rebooking fee to use what's left of the credit, and perhaps a mandatory resort fee while they're at it -- and to get away with it.
We're familiar with the ORS provision. We're confident we could ensure legislative support for the change prior to the next legislative session. Said another way, if the City and County have it all figured out, it's hard to imagine why the legislature would oppose our agreement. We've initiated conversations with legislative leaders and haven't heard any hiccups.
HAVE A PLAN B. Figure that something might go wrong, and be ready with your own suggested alternative schedule rather than wait to see what your airline offers.

history and family history in ways that would be true for many of us, except that we rarely recognize the connections. I was particularly interested in Himes's treatment of the Civil War. The myth of the Lost Cause created a people ready to embrace a militant, if often marginalized, theology. It is the Rice family history that Himes tracks, along with the history of the U.S., until it takes the reader to John R. Rice and his lengthy, influential ministry. Himes does not gloss over the destructive elements of fundamentalism, yet he testifies to his grandfather's sincerity of belief and passionate desire to win souls. Rice was a true believer.

Perhaps even more worrisome, though, are dispersants known as phthalates that cause hormonal and reproductive issues, birth defects and developmental disorders.

Some of the air fresheners that tested positive for phthalates were labeled as "all-natural" or "unscented." Two of the worst offenders analyzed by NRDC were sold at Walgreens stores under that company's own generic label. As a result, Walgreens removed the products from its shelves, and the manufacturer that made them reformulated their product line without phthalates.

Shelton uses asparagus in a stack of three cubes of cake, then completes the dish with lemon granité and creme glace; it's much better than it sounds because the vegetable is more of a conversation point than a major flavor. His chocolate dessert includes a little round of Irish Cream baba, a tiny scoop of chocolate sorbet, and a finely textured mud pie with the background flavor of coffee.

A blanket with blocks of red, blue, brown, green and goldenrod was draped over her shoulders. Circling her neck, wrists and ankles were idzila, permanent decorative metal bands.

Treatments can backfire, too: Drugs used a few years ago to try to help frogs being decimated by a fungal disease in many parts of the world turned out to harm tadpoles, Chaturvedi said. Trying to handle surviving bats for treatment may stress them more than the disease does.

You've got to aim the energies of an organization somewhere, because otherwise people just lose direction.

As the Bush administration attempts to stabilize the nation's economy, we are witness to the final chapter of a period of perverse and dishonest leadership that has used its own crises to justify the expansion of its own power. This was a president who came to office on promises of modesty -- who championed a "humble nation," scorned nation building and promised a more limited role for government in the lives of its citizens. Then he presided over a six-year attempt to tear down and rebuild the nations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and now has embarked on the most profound expansion of the federal government's role in the private economy since the Depression.

Because medical expenses are growing so fast, in my mind, the most important feature in a long-term care contract is the "compound inflation rider" which allows the benefit to grow 5 percent per year on a compounded basis. With the 5 percent rider, a $4,500/month benefit purchased today will be worth $7,330 in 10 years or $9,355 in 15 years. That's a huge commitment on the part of the insurers. Already, many insurers have lowered that rider to 3 to 4 percent on new contracts to control their costs. A 5 percent rider is now much more expensive.

PolitiFact sought to count how often the phrase was used in 2010 but found an accurate tally was unfeasible. It was used hundreds of times during the debate over the bill and revived during the campaign. A few numbers:
The companys increased costs through the pact, including about a $3-an-hour increase in second-tier wages and payment of $1,000 lump-sum annual bonuses, will mostly be canceled out by having fewer expensive skilled-trades workers and eliminating free legal services for workers. The contract will increase GMs costs an estimated total of $175 million this year, as the automaker pays workers $5,000 signing bonuses and offers buyouts of up to $75,000 for skilled-trades workers. After that, the new agreements overall costs drop, impacting the automakers bottom line by $20 million in each of 2012 and 2013.

After Bernard lies to one of his women, Robert is so shocked that what he’d been drinking erupts from his mouth and sprays the room. Wouldn’t such a response cue the victim of the fib to suspect that something’s wrong? That none of the women ever do perpetuates the myth that flight attendants of the ’60s were stupid. Not so. This play is.
"You come back from Iraq or Afghanistan today, you have put yourself on the line for this country," said Filner.

2. Use this opportunity to rest players. The Lakers can avoid such a scenario if they put away the game early and give Coach Mike Brown no excuse not to give his starters an early night off. Kobe Bryant may be missing his seventh consecutive game because of a sore left shin, but Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum sure could use the rest too after averaging 37.4 and 35.5 minutes, respectively. Although Brown has wanted to give Ramon Sessions more minutes because of his age (26) and continual adjustment since arriving here last month, he's still nursing a sprained left shoulder. Doing so would also give the Lakers' bench more of an opportunity to sharpen chemistry a little more than a week before the playoffs start.
