There is a scary corner in his bathroom. Right now, there is a rolled up large IKEA rug, toilet plunger and random plastic bags in it. The rug is from our old house, 5 years ago, and has not been unrolled. Maybe I could get rid of it, or use it. I'm not ready to make a decision yet. So there.
“So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh— for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.” (Rom: 8-12-14)
I saw this on "Live with Kelly" this morning and wanted to give it a try. I've heard about it before but never got around to trying it. It came out alright the first time, but not great. I tried it again and added Butterscotch kisses instead of the chocolate and drizzled some hot fudge and caramel for a bit more flavor (and to make it look more yummy)! I wouldn't say that this is anywhere near as good an oven baked cake, but if your in the mood for a quick cake fix, this is the way to go.

It's all about the hockey and that's partly because hockey is about stories. I remember one particular game, a very special one where my team, the Boston Bruins lost. Doesn't sound like a good story for me right? But then the next day I discovered that the opponents had dedicated that game to their assistant coach Luke Richardson and his family, who had lost his 14 year old daughter Daron to suicide earlier that day. It is this kind of story that makes the winning less important than the heart of the players and the team and this is one of several reasons that this particular team is my second favourite hockey team these days. It is also another reason I love the sport so much.
Frank also shared loads of stories and advice about how simple things can become stories if you add a lot of imagination and a little magic – and talked about all the things that inspired him to become a children’s writer.

This is definitely an American Imperial Stout, and one for the hop heads. I prefer my stouts with a little less of a homicidal bitterness to them but this is still a great beer and worth getting your hands on. It is interesting just how much more bitter this tastes compared to the Bourbon County Brand Stouts, considering the identical 60 IBU. I guess it's all in the hops.

The manager was packing up as I got back, the truck hadn’t turned up yet but he had to get home. That truck came later and I half-remember hearing Iliaz telling them about me half-asleep. It was 10 by the time I opened up my sleeping bag and put it on the wooden bench outside since Iliaz suggested the breeze was good there and there were some people watching tv behind a partition in the main office. But then after an hour and a half of mosquito-buzzed disturbed sleep I got out some odomos and moved to the floor inside the office. The next thing I remember is Iliaz waking me up at 3:45 the next morning like I’d asked him to.

An underlying implication of all of this is that I want to bring to the forefront now is the idea that the Church exists to proclaim the Gospel (not only to the world) but to itself. There is a tendency to think that once we accept Christ and the Gospel, that we can put that aside, except maybe during evangelism or occasional sermons, and move on to becoming better people. But if we could not become better people on our own before we met the Gospel, indeed it was our confrontation with the cross of the Gospel that brought us to the realization that we were powerless without it, then what makes us think that we don’t need the Gospel once we’ve accepted it? Discipleship is reminding our flesh that we still need God. The church’s method has always been songs, preaching, and the Lord’s Supper which symbols show us that we were so helpless that Christ’s flesh was ripped apart so that we could live, and live not by returning to our own standards, but in continuance with the Gospel, so that we become conformed to the image of Christ, and go out and proclaim with word and deed the Gospel to the nations! (You might need to read that last sentence again!)
When it comes to cooking and baking, my instincts almost always draw me to my past. Nostalgia, and paying homage to food-centric memories and moments, is a huge source of inspiration for me. And especially for those of us who discovered food allergies or intolerances later in life, nostalgia is definitely something we know about.
I took my Nan a Christmas Pudding decoration that I had made her. After popping a photo on my facebook page of these I had to make a few more as my Mum and Sister hinted that they wanted one each. I then decided to make some for the Nans too. When I gave this to Nan she showed me a present sitting on her shelf that I had made out of Fimo for Grandad many moons ago - it was a little pig golfing, it is so lovely that after all those years she still has it on show.

Remember the old Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercials? Where the serendipitous collision of chocolate and peanut butter resulted in a scrummy treat? Similar things are happening in the brewery right now, except that neither chocolate nor peanut butter are involved. Come to think of it, the serendipity has been found wanting as well. I guess there's not much similarity after all, but it makes for a smashing opening paragraph.

The pint glass has been the standard of goods exchange for draft beer retailers for generations of beer drinkers. A U.S. liquid pint is a volume of measure defined as 16 ounces, or around 473 milliliters. (The British went so far as to regulate the servings of beer by law centuries ago, hence their 20-ounce imperial pint.) The name pint has its roots in the Old French and ultimately in the Latin picta, meaning “painted,” referring to the serving line painted on an ale vessel. The very definition of this word has historical origins tied to the selling, serving and consumption of beer – but all that may have now come to an end.

Science fiction has already anticipated this situation. Ben Bova’s Asteroid Wars series, which is part of his larger, Grand Tour of the Solar System series, tells the story of greedy corporations fighting over control of the Solar System’s resources. While catching and mining asteroids is exciting and could save our economy, hopefully we won’t let things turn as violent as Ben Bova’s novels predict.

I am 36 years old, though, and my tubal surgery was 12 years ago. On top of that, my health insurance will not pay for reversal of sterilization. We found out by accident, though, that they will pay for a portion of IVF treatments.

After meeting with my social worker this morning, at 11am, I went to the nurses station to ask if they could unlock my room so that I could go back to sleep. They kindly let me and I slept from 11am until 2.20pm when my psychologist called my mobile and said that I am 2o minutes late in meeting her. Woopsy. Then went back to sleep from 3pm until 6pm, got up for dinner which I don’t normally eat as I eat at 12pm, a big hot meal. And now it’s 8pm and I’m still yawning!
Monday, 7 August, Estergom at last: Once again we left early. Bonzo had taken good care of our bikes and was there when we left at 0745 and, amazingly, didn’t bark. We stopped in the first village we came to in search of coffee. The bar that we stopped at was completely full but they weren’t drinking coffee, even at nine in the morning. The barman poured us a lukewarm cup from a thermos. It had to have been from yesterday but it kept us going. Nothing to eat, however so we pedaled on.
PMA Eco-Trail is a 10k loop along the academy’s outskirts. The trail was established just recently during the PMA alumni homecoming where a simple trail run was held. Not even cadets uses that trails so you can just imagine how fresh the trails are. Leaves serves as a cushion between the ground and your shoes. Pine tress shadows you from the sun, so you can run any time of the day. Mossy forest in every turn that you will forgot that you are just in a city. Cool and gentle breeze are also on treat on your hot body as you attack the hills. These are just the few reason to describe PMA best kept secret. And sad to say, that the trail are not open for public.

"Born in 1966, Jovanotti, made his debut at the age of twenty for Radio Deejay, under the aegis of Claudio Cecchetto. The renowned "Il Grande Boh!" was not in fact his debut as a writer as "Yo, brothers and sisters" had already launched him into the literary world. But his real passion was music, and this is where he has undergone his greatest personal and professional growth. His albums, without considering a number of singles associated with specific events (such as Cuore written to commemorate the tragic death of Giovanni Falcone), are the milestones of a complex musical journey that over the years has explored more and more genres and influences. Jovanotti has intensified his tours and collaborations and has performed with internationally renowned artists (Pino Daniele, Luca Carboni, Luciano Pavarotti)."

In the time since my conversion I’ve known moments of deep, even suicidal, despair. I’ve known moments – and sometimes months – of anger that threatens to consume me. As I said, these have been themes to my Christian life. But they are not the only themes. So it is that I’ve also known love, which is the deepest magic of all. I’ve known my wife of three months, my parents, and my Benne brothers. I’ve known places of safety, peace, joy, and hope. These stand with – and against – the places of betrayal, mistrust, suspicion and hostility. Despair and joy have existed simultaneously as the chief themes of my Christian life. (And frankly, I suspect that any Christian who cannot relate to this is either, as Westley memorably put it in Princess Bride, lying or selling something.) That’s how the first ten years have gone. I don’t anticipate the years to follow being much different. I will wander in and out of the Dark Wood of Error, into and out of heaven, but seldom in anything like a progressive order. So goes the Christian life.

This kind of love is unconditional. She doesn’t have to do anything to deserve it, and there is nothing she could do to lose it. Just as it is for us with God. John wrote, In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. (1 John 4:10 NKJV) God did not show His love for us because we showed Him love first. In fact, He didn’t even show His love towards us because we were perfect. On the contrary we were sinners. Paul said, But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8 NKJV)Your wife may not be perfect, but you are still called to love her so intensely that despite her imperfections and faults, you would lay down your life for her. Even if she doesn’t meet up to your standards sometimes, and makes you upset. You know we often put standards on people that we can’t and sometimes will not meet ourselves.

This blog is aimed at any person who sees a movie or reads a book and says, “I could do better than that.” Because, you can. You must. I’m not going to claim I can make you into a millionaire author. If that happens, please send me some money. I’m not going to claim to make you a best selling writer. Or an overnight sensation. Or anything, for that matter. I won’t lie. A publishing friend of mine suggested I start a blog to promote my work. This is for my own benefit, to a degree. What I don’t want is to crap on about my favourite coffee houses or tell you all about my dog.

I’m picky about documentation. I freely admit it. I embrace it. I get up on my soap box and preach it on a regular basis. I do my best to document everything. My genealogy program prompts me to enter the source material and do so correctly. I set it up to do this every time I enter new information. Have I always been good about documenting? No, I have made all kinds of mistakes when it comes to documentation. I have little scraps of paper with info on them but not source. I have no idea where the information came from but wish I did. I learned my lesson.

As for the family’s future, we know they make it all right. Virginia would marry the boy from across town, Ernest Knisely; and in 1942, Erma would marry Don Foutz, of Dover. Uncle Bill would serve in World War II, save lives and return home safely. By 1942, Charles has moved the family to 448 Kelly St. NW, where he and Viola will reside the rest of their lives.
The space is small. Somehow, it looks bigger on camera and keeping it rather simple further tricks the eye into believing it is more spacious. Still, I would love a place to put a bottle of wine or a casserole dish mid-meal without crowding the table or having to run to the kitchen counter every ten minutes. Not that the kitchen is far, but who likes their host dashing back and forth the whole meal? A handy surface would make life easier, but with such cramped quarters the options are limited (the chair touches the wall under the painting when pulled out, so anything would have to be really tucked into that corner, to the right, and pretty small, so folks can still squeeze by).

It used to be that economists argued that outsourcing wouldn’t be problematic here in the US as long as we had enough growth in spite of the outsourcing that Americans would still have jobs. In order for that to happen, we would need to stimulate the economy – preferably through monetary policy. As it is, fiscal policy is crippled because of politics and monetary policy is crippled because of an overly conservative Federal Reserve unwilling to bend to the need of the unemployed.

Malians were already suspicious of Sanogo’s willingness to vacate power, and his televised statement on Monday to members of the Malian press, delivered in the Bamanan language, has only fanned the flames.

My brother, as confidant a 14 year old you would ever find, now seems pissed that this guy has the audacity to proof him. So with a roll of his eyes, and cigarette in the corner of his mouth, he flips my brother-in law’s draft card over to him. By this time, I am shitting it out over by the jukebox. I am having visions of the barkeep pressing a silent alarm and S.W.A.T appearing at the front door any minute now.

Mikey wants justice for his sister who changed so much after her sexual assault while Ellie loves her brother and wants to protect him. It all hinges on Ellie’s eyewitness account about the events of that night and what she saw. The story switches between Mikey and Ellie so I can see how they both felt and how the allegation has affected their families. Mikey at first approaches Ellie for information wanting to help his sister but eventually the pair fall in love all under terrible and tragic circumstances since Mikey’s sister has accused Ellie’s brother of rape.

Overnight the Asian markets were mostly higher gaining 0.2%. European markets opened lower, but turned higher gaining 0.8%. US index futures were lower, then higher, overnight. At 8:30 Q1 GDP was reported lower than expected: +2.2% vs +3.0%. The market opened higher, however, at SPX 1404 and hit 1405 in the first few minutes. The SPX had closed at 1400 yesterday. After the open the market started to pullback. At 10:00 Consumer sentiment was reported slightly higher: 76.4 vs 76.2. The market made a low at SPX 1397 right after the report, then started to work its way higher. At 1:30 the SPX hit a higher high for the day at 1407. Then it pulled back some to SPX 1402 just before the close, and ended the week at 1403.

Our final day was spent on the beach, a swim in the ocean, two-for-one happy hour at a beach bar, then topped off with a trolly ride to Hollywood’s Expo Alfresco. It was completely coincidental that we were here at the same time but we are so glad we went. For $15 a person you were given a plate and expected to eat a lot. Wine samples we scattered about, as was live music, and the food represented all areas of Hollywood’s culinary scene. The $1 trolly ride to downtown really made the evening even more fun; functioning Wednesday-Sunday, there are three wooded trollies making rounds all over Hollywood every half hour.

I adore flip-flops. There was a fancy flip-flop store in our town that sold $50 flip-flops. Fifty damn dollars? It's a piece of rubber with two pieces of fabric. And now I sound like my grandmother.
While baking these tasty little morsels of goodness, our home was filled with the aroma of warm cinnamon and brown sugar! Soooo easy to make! I picked up all the ingredients at our local bulk food store, including the cone bags.

All those solids come from my stash thanks to the Pink Chalk Fabrics Monthly Solids Club, I've only had to order 3 more to complete the look I want. I'm using 12 of the fabrics from the pre-cut packs and have concentrated on the blue/purple/green colourways. This is for next month's project.
AND the most exciting part....we get to stay at the brand spanking new Art of Animation resort!!!!!!! I booked us a Cars suite!! So so excited!! It's costing us about $530 more versus two single rooms at Pop Century, but I am so so excited. And since we have to wait an entire year, it gives us more time to pay it off.
Someone like St Anthony of Padua was a magnificent preacher, greatly gifted with eloquent and powerful preaching, but then great Saints are rare, not common, the exception to the rule, so how come the Faithful knew the Faith inside out before?
I recently attended Secret Church: The Cross and Suffering at The Church at Brook Hills in Birmingham, Alabama. I cannot even begin to unpack all that I learned and that I am continuing to learn from my time there. Suffice it to say, David Platt could be a professional auctioneer and we covered 220-something pages and 75 key texts in 1 night. Now, we all know that I am a Nerd (yes, that’s “nerd” with a capital “N”), but whoa Nelly! my mind was so moving so fast that night that I think a little bit of it is still spinning trying to comprehend everything that I learned. Perhaps that is why I took no less than 4 trips to the main office building today at work in 20 minutes because I kept forgetting something. Yes, that sounds like a good excuse.

No Country for Old Men has one major thing going against it, and one major thing going for it. Both of those things are Cormac McCarthy. His prose is so unique it brings immediate gravitas to all of his works. Once I start reading one of his books there's a cadence to his words that is almost hypnotic; he is truly a gifted writer, and a filmmaker can work character motivations, dialogue, and general descriptions of scenery into a movie, but the language chosen for the overall narrative...that's a color that doesn't exist on a director's palette.

Even laying low it was still difficult not to attract attention riding a 1940’s style American Indian with white wall tires and a black wolf seated in front of you. If she attracted the wrong attention they quickly gave her a wide berth when her companion bore his teeth. She attracted attention just by walking into a room even with out the dog trailing behind her. If she wanted to she could have been a model, but the idea never crossed her mind.The older ones on the reservation called her Joelanar, meaning kindred. They believed the wolf and her had been mates in another life, and that was why he refused to leave her side. She didn’t know if she believed that, but even she recognized that they shared an uncanny sense of understanding. He had already lived longer then the average life span of a house pet, and didn’t show any signs of slowing down. Like her his true age was a mystery.

If a piece has a chip I just turn it, so that it will be invisible. Slowly, I will find good pieces over the years and nudge the illusions out of the room.

the theories are endless. some suggest a later date for the manuscript though the dating seems to be pretty solid. some think its a 15th century hoax with nothing meaningful to be gleaned from it at all. but it seems too complex a hoax for the time. (like, for instance, the language displays natural patterns that were not recognized until the 20th century, but would be almost impossible to happen on by chance.) similarly, the theory that it is an encoded document sounds good, except that all attempts to decode it using the cryptography of the day seem destined to fail…and more complex codes don’t seem to fit the historical picture. its been postulated that it is some non-european language, maybe east-asian, written with a european alphabet. but there is nothing solid suggesting asian medicine or imagery. glossolalia has even been suggested. to this day, countless people are trying to figure this thing out and no one has.

Ichikawa also has no illusions about the rebellious Taeko. While most Western films celebrate and often idealize the rebellion of the young against adults, Taeko's actions are often reckless and have consequences that complicate our responses to her. Ichikawa, who in the past had also confronted us with the dire reality of war (as he did in Fires on the Plain), puts the conflict in the distance to keep our concentration on how the afflictions of time alter the Makioka chemistry. Even the music, the largo from Handel's opera Serse, is scored for modern synthesizers and guitar creating a timeless mood of coronation, a stately quest for marriage set against the unpredictable forces of nature.

As stated above, you can use either Active Dry Yeast or Instant Yeast. I use Active Dry so I mix it with the water, oil & sugar and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it starts bubbling. Then, I mix it into the dry ingredients. If you’re using Instant, you can skip this step and mix everything together right away. For more than you would ever want to know about yeast and Active Dry vs. Instant, you can visit this post.

Doug Axe’s research likewise studies genes that it turns out show great evidence of design. Axe studied the sensitivities of protein function to mutations. In these “mutational sensitivity” tests, Dr. Axe mutated certain amino acids in various proteins, or studied the differences between similar proteins, to see how mutations or changes affected their ability to function properly. He found that protein function was highly sensitive to mutation, and that proteins are not very tolerant to changes in their amino acid sequences. In other words, when you mutate, tweak, or change these proteins slightly, they stopped working. In one of his papers, he thus concludes that “functional folds require highly extraordinary sequences,” and that functional protein folds “may be as low as 1 in 10^77.”
We were reminded that what we are fortunate to be doing is something others enjoy supporting and following. The local club was excited to see us down there. It's amazing the difference when we are viewed as the new Australia crew. As athletes three of us have spent plenty of time down at Carrum but yesterday the excitement towards us was a noticeable change. It was a great reminder because we are now preparing to compete for our Country on behalf of a wider community and it's something we are proud of and will use to support us.
I wonder what decision will be made about Mila now.
The Spirit of the God who dwells in the hearts of believers, and the third person of the Trinity, is our promised helper (John 14:17), and the “down payment” of the life to come (Ephesians 1:14). The Spirit is not a “force,” but a person. Morrow is correct when he says, “There is no spiritual formation if there is no activity of the Holy Spirit,” (p. 223).

The 1500 m at Kanto is scheduled for Saturday and features two of the best Japanese collegiates, Akinobu Murasawa (Tokai Univ.) and Suguru Osako (Waseda Univ.), on the list, but both are also on the list for the weekend's most competitive meet, Saturday's Golden Games in Nobeoka. In the 5000 m Murasawa, who was the top Japanese man in the Payton Jordan 10000 m in 27:50.59, is slated to face the likes of World XC silver medalist Paul Tanui (Kenya/Team Kyudenko), 13:18 man Yu Mitsuya (Team Toyota Kyushu) and former national champion Yuichiro Ueno (Team S&B), while Osako, the 2011 World University Games 10000 m gold medalist, will be chasing the Olympic A-standard in the 10000 m against 2007 World Championships 10000 m bronze medalist Martin Mathathi (Kenya/Suzuki Hamamatsu AC), former Hakone Ekiden star Ryuji Kashiwabara (Team Suzuki) and at least five sub-28 Japanese men if he starts. The women's 5000 m in Nobeoka most notably includes the strong Sally Chepyego (Kenya/Team Kyudenko) and national record holder Kayoko Fukushi (Team Wacoal).
I would say this film is different and unique because it took a classic television show and made it relatable to people who grew up watching ’21 Jump Street’ and also to a younger audience who have never seen it. Also it was a big risk turning the show into a modern-day comedy as there are not many movies out there today that are actually worth watching.

Joe: Depending upon their location, rallies can offer a variety of utility hookup connections. Some will offer full hookups with electric, water and sewer. Most, however, will provide only partial hookups; meaning an electrical and possibly a water hookup. And others will only provide dry camping. It is a good idea to read the rally literature carefully so you know exactly what to expect. No matter what you sign up for or what you expect, however, it is a good idea to show up at a rally prepared for dry camping.

The screaming lead to spitting all over my face in his rage. His uncontrollable temper found me in my car, with my children freaking out in the back seat, as he held the door so I couldn't close it. His fury to get the keys away from me, jerked me out towards the door and bashing my head on the frame of the car. His need to control everything ended up with the spare key broken in the ignition, and a slice on my finger. His blindness terrorized my oldest child, when he yanked the phone out of her hand and smashed it on the ground when she tried to call grandma.

Now I may be in the minority by thinking this way (which is fine because I’m used to being in a minority), but isn’t art supposed to be provocative (even if the provocation is negative)? Isn’t art supposed to take you out of your comfort zone and make you think differently (even if by thinking differently we want to vomit); or see things differently? Isn’t art supposed to mirror the authors’ worlds and the times in which they live? When I took English Lit in college, my professor gave a Reader’s Digest-condensed version of the world/times of any given English author we were to read and discuss/critique in order to give us a broader understanding from what “place” the author was writing.

In the case of the very big breweries, like Anheuser-Busch, this means lots of power. A-B annoints distributors like the Queen annoints knights--to receive a contract from Bud is to have a printing press for cash. (In the annals of American history, more than one story of political corruption includes a lackey and a beer distributorship.) In many cities, A-B has a proprietary distributor that will carry no other non-sanctioned breweries. This is why Redhook and Widmer did a "strategic alliance" with A-B, or whatever it was called, because it gave the companies access to the superhighway of Bud distribution.

After spending the weekend at All Tomorrows Parties surrounded by the achingly cool, the prospect of a steam train was a strangely welcome one. I'd spent three days watching the likes of Broken Social Scene, Camera Obscura, The Fall, Pavement and The Clear but The West Somerset Railway was just too much of a pull. Running between Minehead and Bishop Lydeard it transports one at a more genteel pace through country and coastal views. Preferable to being thrown round bends on a sweaty bus full of hungover hipsters? Or maybe this is just a cover? I ask myself how long it will be until I am living with the cats and carrying my magazines in a plastic bag.

It is not the fact that the Tories take large sums of money from rich people that is shocking here. In large part, many of those rich people are likely to be as disappointed as Trade Union members in their donations to Labour. For the real Capitalists, the owners of the biggest companies like Microsoft, there is no need to pay money to have dinner with Cameron or any other politician. It is more likely to be the other way around, and certainly Governments fall over themselves to hand over money to get these companies to invest in their economies. In the end, it is the interests of these Big capitalists that win out, not the small fry, who feel the need to hand over the odd £1/4 million, in the hope of gaining some personal favour. What is shocking is the fact that the supposedly sophisticated media, of a developed country like Britain, have acted with such surprise at it being revealed.

Lesson: You don’t always know your audience as well as you think you do. What matters isn’t intent, but performance. It’s absolutely important to put thought into your content, designs, campaigns, and other website aspects. But it’s equally important to follow up and find out where you were on the mark, and where you had room for improvement. Analytics can give you the information you need about traffic, links, bounce rates, social sharing and more. Move forward with your site making informed choices, not speculative ones.

If the Lions want any chance of winning the NFC North, they have to at least split the season series with Green Bay in 2012.

The importance of efficient resource planning to achieve project success cannot be undermined. For efficient planning of resources a number of aspects should be taken into consideration e.g. Scheduling should be such as to effectively cope with the demands of the project, should be based on the optimum utilization of the skills of the resources, should be done well in advance, and at the same time should take into consideration the happiness and morale of the staff.

Do thou ask, creation answereth, and by its answer, as by the confession of the creature, thou, O saint of God, blessest God, and “talkest of His power.”

Another thing that's changed is that as we've stepped out of the shadow, the broom closet, and the history books, we've drawn a lot more attention to ourselves. Where once cries of occult ritual murders and such would have meant a lot of hysteria, but now they are real attacks against our ways of life. In California, there is still a battle over freedom of religion, where paganism is not counted in the "Big Five" (three of which are Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) and thus "may not have the same rights and protections" as the "big five."

You can also sneak around. Shoot from far away with a long lens. You can stand far away and capture moments from people when they have no idea that you're photographing them.

Capture times when people are way into something and focused there.

He delivered my tax return a couple of days ago and it's been sitting on my worktable to remind me to block out some time to tackle it. I'd only been in business a matter of weeks last time around so this one is going to be a lot more involved. And of course, I have all my paper work in order - not. But then this morning he arrived with a box choc full of goodies from the lovely Karen Totten of Starry Road Studio and all was forgiven.

In the last year hop prices have decreased significantly, in particularly US varieties, now making it financially viable to dry hop beers without increasing costs significantly. This is great news for craft beer in Britain as it allows us as brewers to increase the quality of the finished product. The brewers dilemma is at what point is a beer of sufficient quality whilst still remaining profitable? It simply boils down to simple economics, if a commodity is cheaper we can use more whilst still being competitive on price. So with one eye on 2011 I for one am excited at the prospect of using bale after bale of US green goodies to dry hop more of our beers & give them that wow factor!

October was an extremely difficult month for the Homercat household, culminating on October 31st when, after a long struggle with progressively worse illnesses, we had to bid goodbye to our little grey-striped Misty-cat. She was the strongest, sweetest little kitty in the world and we will miss her so very, very much. She was born in Ottawa, Canada on July 1, 1995 (or thereabouts), being tossed away like garbage and left to die, we never knew her actual birthdate, but she lived through that experience (after being rescued by a vet who found her on the side of the road), and has graced our lives ever since. She was diagnosed with diabetes almost 4 years ago and lived through her twice daily injections with loving good humour, never once complaining or running and hiding to get away from it. If we could have half her courage, half her heart and half her love, we will have lived a very good life indeed. Rest In Peace our little baby, and we hope you have a great hereafter in Heaven chasing butterflies and waxing fat and sassy. All our love forever, your Mom and Dad.

As human beings, we all want certainty, which mean we stay away from pain as significantly we can and want more pleasure in our lives. We make certain that we all items are in location and in order. We want all our daily needs for survival always available. We also want feel comfortable on our surroundings, conditions and ourselves. Some seek certainty to gain power over others by controlling them, and some use it to benefit others. Whether we like it or not, we want to feel comfortable and and sometimes, if not most of the time, laidback, relaxed and just plain lazy.
And so be it dear child. And I shall come and return again, as did Jesus Christ. Go hither. Go yond. For we are the beings of Light that you seek. We are the beings that of which you speak. Go yond. Go hither and find your way. An angel, a star, a galaxy away. For here we await your Glory Divine, and all shall unfold in earth angel’s time.

Next up are The Drums, who just have to be seen live to be believed. Jonathan Pierce camply stalks around the stage, chest puffed with a strangely likeable arrogance while entertaining a crowd, which could almost be there to see them headline.

When you’re a kid all the old people ask you what you want to be when you grow up. As a kid, you feel you have this potential to be anything and it’s a really hard decision to make up your mind what to do. Well, it feels the same way when you’re older. People ask you what you’re going to do when you retire, and you think of all the possibilities. Whether you are young or old, the key is learning to deal with reality and it’s limitations. Those dark-haired beauties I saw at Sports Authority today would never have given me the time of day, even when I was their age. And there’s never been an age that I could have been an extreme sports guy. If you’re going to be regretful, you need to be realistically regretful.

Not feeling all that inspired lately. Is it the foggy, crappy weather? I'm not sure. So I'm basically just going to copy what my blogging cohort the Texpatriate has done. She's my idol, so I don't feel weird copying her. I'm kind of like Jamie Lynn to her Britney. So enjoy. Or not. But here goes:
I have found the drunker people get the less their inner monologue says,"No do not embarrass yourself. Or No that poor waitress with the multiple drinks on her tray does not want any part of your dancing skills." Every weekend it seems myself and other waitresses included, try to make our way through the floor to deliver our drinks to a table waiting patiently, and it never fails that some man who is either blacked out or almost to that point starts to dance poorly and attempts to get us to dance with them. As much as I love to take part in random dancing numbers I can not seem to express enough that I would much rather make some money off of you then dance with you.

So why does our Lord Jesus was us to remember Lot’s wife? Lot’s wife escaped the judgment of Sodom that typified the coming judgment of the world and its inhabitants. She was saved from that judgment. Surely, all the things that she held dear were still in Sodom. She is a warning to all those who are in Christ, but still hold onto the world. As a pillar of salt, she is forever a warning of those who lose their saltiness.
Clearly, this wasn't written by the person who sent the first email. The first email was coherent and well-written while this one is a mess. Maybe they're deliberately trying to appear confused, perhaps a side effect of being "hit in the back of the neck with a club". I love that they've chosen $1980.00 as the amount. Not $2000, not $1950. Is that supposed to make it sound more legit? I also like the request to not "make a scene" of this and to keep it to myself.

Sarah L. Palin posts have generated such intense interest, a revision was in order. This time the moderator applies the scalpel, making an even deeper incision in a wider radius, in order to insure the cancerous cloud of ignorance surrounding all things Palin is completely removed, w/no chance for it to metastasize. The moderator has “scrubbed up” and is ready to continue operation! This post will provide an outline for those seeking to unravel the mystery and see beyond the “fantasy narrative” of Alaska’s infamous MK’d Kitten “Caribou Barbie.” For a clear understanding of not who, but “what” Sarah Palin & family are, the reader MUST be familiar w/ the origins, organizations and government institutions surrounding MK-Ultra Monarch Program, which created the Palin phenomenon — see MK-Ultra tab on blog header.
I am wary of the word genocide. I think in recent times it has been appropriated for political reasons, and thereby robbed of some meaning. What is happening to ordinary people living in the Eastern Congo is devastatingly painful to read about or contemplate, and I find it difficult to research or write about. Too much of it is happening because you and I enjoy our cellphones and other electronics.
So I'm not so bad, even if if the middle path at that party looked like this:

Secondly, today of all days, when our thoughts turn to where we are going as a country and as a people, it is right that we should think of him, because he was the creator of what – after his death – became our national anthem, an anthem that is intriguing because it is so ambiguous – not only with regard to who exactly is being addressed, but also because it must be the only anthem in the world to end not on a shadaj but on a madhyam – not on certainty and finality but on ambiguity and continuity. Of course the national anthem is only the first of five stanzas of a song. But still, this ambiguity and continuity seem to reflect, at least to me, some aspects of the openness and open-mindedness of the poet himself – who was writing at a time when many people’s views were becoming closed and rigid.
Now, to what I have seen. I was blown away by two different but equally incredibly powerful British films by female directors, Lynne Ramsay’s We Need to Talk About Kevin and Andrea Arnold’s bold Wuthering Heights retelling. Two films that could be the last of a dying breed if David Cameron gets his way… but that showcase the true talent in acting, writing, directing and cinematography that Britain has to offer. To continue the patriotic theme, Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy was also brilliant, an excellent film with perhaps the best British ensemble cast, in one of my favourite genres.

The other incident I’ll share happened with my employer. I was going through the murky depths of trying to get a correct diagnosis (most people with chronic illness take years to get properly diagnoses – partly because of experiences like the one I just mentioned). To put it mildly, things were not good. My supervisor, who encouraged us to have an open conversation with him, just wanted to know when it was going to be “fixed.” Let’s just say I didn’t feel open telling him that I had no idea (and later that it never would be). Instead I felt pressured to drop to part time so I wouldn’t cost the business as much money. And I learned a hard lesson about being open.

This is when I knew that a drastic course of action must be taken, for Anne had crossed the line from annoying drama queen to a woman who was trying to exercise nonexistent authority by cutting me off from my family and holding me against my will. Knowing that I must override her with extreme prejudice or become trapped, I left the house in search of a pay phone. When I could procure no means of public communication I returned home, ate, went over to Uncle Nose-Hair's house, and used his telephone. I reached my parents and told them everything.

The question is, should we speak out or hold our tongues? Being a non-confrontational person, I would love to simply crawl away and let society think what it will -- but that isn't the right thing. Throughout history, the only way that persecuted groups such as women voters, black people and gay rights activitists have gained their their rights has been to fight for them. To stand up and be heard.
Movie critic Roger Ebert once said that no one has a right to take that moment of discovery away from someone else, and for stories like The Sixth Sense or The Others where the twist at the end is so crucial to that OMG reaction, I absolutely agree. If someone had tipped me off ahead of time about either of those movies, I would have been furious. I would have felt robbed of that magical moment of realization.

The total current South African budget is about R200 billion so that the required income transfer would amount to about 25 percent of this. An amount of R100 a month is, of course, very much less than a survival income, but EPRI's calculations were not intended as an estimate of basic income requirements. It is clear that an adequate basic income paid in rands for lifting people above the poverty line is out of the question.

So now I’ve gotten back to the point where I left London. It was my first time leaving the English-speaking greater community, and the first thing that greeted me when the train emerged from the Chunnel was a field of pure green and a grey, overcast sky with storm-wrought winds pushing across the tops of the open stretch of land. American fields may look like golden waves as the wind caresses them, but these were green-dyed silk sheets rippling over themselves as someone shook the crumbs off of them in the morning for a newly-set table. What a wonderful sight to welcome me.
We kicked off our series last night at Pipeline. Four more weeks travelling through the book of Song of Solomon (SOS). What a book. In a culture steeped with sex whenever it’s available, sexual innuendos, pornography, rape, lust, child molestation, men cheating on their wives and wives cheating on the their husbands, Christian singles living together with no conviction (can you be a Christ-follower without conviction…Holy Spirit?), is there a place to turn to get a different perspective. Yes. An entire book of the Bible devoted to not just sex, but sex that is a part of a more important element, love and intimacy and commitment. There are so many teenage girls and twenty-something ladies giving away sex because they are afraid of losing a guy. Afraid that they will be alone. Afraid that time is running out and by mid-twenties, you better do what you need to do to make sure you don’t end up without a guy. On the flip side, here comes a guy so empty, so shallow, so driven and controlled by physical impulses that he has no desire to emotionally and spiritually enter the woman. Translation: The objectification of women. Result: Relationships start on the wrong foundation and from there get into bed with brokenness, anger, pain, sex without love, and baggage for the next person to come along. 1st time marriages end approx 50% of the time. 2nd time marriages end 67% of the time, 3rd marriages 74% of the time (these stats vary based on resource). It’s like we are drinking poison over and over and over and God comes and offers a wonderful, beautiful way to do all this and we reject because at least all the pain comes with the freedom to be rebellious and do things the way we want to do it.

The latest research is showing evidence of persistent viral infection in sufferers and last week's big findings by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, in which over 700 unique proteins were identified in the spinal fluid of ME patients, seems to have escaped the media in the UK due to the frenzy over the widely-discredited PACE Trial. We would do well to pay close attention to this cerebrospinal fluid work (in addition to the research on XMRV) as it validates previous studies carried out in this area and gives tangible proof that something is happening in the neurological system of those afflicted.

Labour delivered a final two-fingered salute to Britain by boasting 'there's no money left' on leaving office, it emerged yesterday as it became clear that the true size of the national debt is more than £2trillion.The new Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liberal Democrat David Laws, revealed that he arrived at his office to discover a handover note from his Labour predecessor Liam Byrne.It read: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid to tell you there is no money. Kind regards and good luck!'So in just 13 years these cunts raid our pensions, base the entire economy on the fantasy economics of ever rising house prices, encourage a debt boom on dubious credit all the while doing nothing except blow money on tree hugging consultants.

Method: Cream butter, sugar, and egg in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in the flour, salt, lemon juice, vanilla essence, baking powder, raisins, cashew nuts, and cinnamon powder. Refrigerate the mix for few minutes if needed to make it firm. Preheat oven to 160 degree celcius. Shape into lime-sized balls, sprinkile some sugar on the top, press down slightly, and place on a lightly greased pizza tray or cookie sheet allowing enough room for spreading. Bake for 10-15 minutes on convection 160 degree celcius or till the edges become slightly brown. They are quite nutritious and tasty – one of our 4-yr-old taste taster Adarsh’s favorites too :-).

Much of King's Lynn's rich history is continuing and living. In addition to the architectural culture there are three market days the oldest of which began in the 12th Century and the King's Lynn Mart, a fair held each February which was granted rights to hold it by Henry VIII in 1537. Everything bespeaks continuity in this town not the severing of it as in Birmingham.

Tonight, I’d like to speak to you about this transition. But first, let us remember why we came here. It was here, in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden established a safe haven for his terrorist organization. It was here, in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda brought new recruits, trained them, and plotted acts of terror. It was here, from within these borders, that al Qaeda launched the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 innocent men, women and children.

Lets not spend so much time trying to identify and distinguish differences and similarities between denominations when we ought to be studying and digesting the Word of God. As long as Christ is in one’s heart, He can do His business. I encourage each of you to focus more on the mission of God rather than the mission of whatever denomination you associate with. With every denomination I have encountered there has been some type of discrepancy with the Word. Not only are the denominations causing division but they are also contradicting each other. Don’t get wrapped up in titles because it really only boils down to the fact that the Bible does not mention the Church being associated with any type of denomination. While denominations are separating Christians by their interpretation of Scripture, creeds, and statements of belief, God is telling us to unite as the body of Christ. Every denomination will tell you that they are the “true church” but they all cannot be right, so then who is wrong? Don’t waste time trying to figure it out. We can only get to the Father through the Son (John 14:6 ), not by being a Jehovah’s Witness or COGIC or Protestant etc. How can you not fellowship with your brother or sister in Christ because they don’t go to a holiness church like you do? Seek the Truth that comes from God and not from the denominations created by man. One God. One Church. One Baptism. One Faith. One Spirit.
Some years ago, back in the so-called Thatcherite boom years, I met a secondary school teacher who'd moved from London to the West Country. Having taught in some tough schools in South London, she thought she'd seen everything. She was wrong. She found that for young people in the town she lived in, there were only three career choices: university, the armed forces or the dole. In this woman's own words:
The butter I've used below Lurpak unsalted butter. Its produces good ghee. However, my last batch was made with a grass-fed organic brand, which was far better in colour, flavour and aroma.
then add broth. You can use vegetable or chicken broth.
- Temper your chocolate, and gently dip each peppermint in using a fork. (They do become a bit brittle, so be very careful. Broken means "sample" in my book!) Lift out quickly, letting any excess chocolate drain against the side of the bowl, and place on the prepared cookie sheet. Let set.

If true, may he rest in peace. If true, this is a somber victory and should be regarded as such. No one wins when we make a martyr of anyone, and especially not when people figuratively spit on his grave. I'm truly sorry that this has to be the resolution of the whole terrible ordeal.
I looked up and saw the postman’s face peering through the hedge. I just waved and hurried back into the house, conscious that my Mediterranean tan might look a tad decadent on a dreary North London morning in the middle of March.

There were no rock stars there, and almost every dance I had was lovely. Some were challenging, some were comfortable, some were playful. It was exactly what I needed after last night. And I can't wait to go back.
Again, like Aristotle, de Tocqueville seemed to recognize that when one group of people get a hold of the government they vote themselves and their government into oblivion. Cronyism (which has NOTHING to do with capitalism, really it’s closer to socialism in form, so the term crony capitalism is just stupid) has shown us how this is true in one case, the bankrupting of every state and the federal government has shown the other extreme to also be true. (I don’t think even Aristotle or de Tocqueville could have imagined such a hideous hydra as one where the very rich and very poor conspire together to bleed the middle class dry). But the fact of the matter is that we haven’t had a president or Congress that hasn’t played to one if not both of these since Coolidge. So what do we need now, we need a leader who is going to tell both groups, which are hell-bent on destroying our civilization, to go to hell.
The diamond plate, wood grain and “happy birthday” are found in Grunge, and the “dad” sentiment is from Tough Guy. The background was embossed with the Distressed Sizzix embossing plate. To make the denim piece I took a bashful blue cardstock circle and swiped my Not Quite Navy ink pad vertically and then horizontally to give it that denim look.
Yay! It's that time of year again. It's time for my highly anticipated non-expert-entirely-subjective fashion review.
I explained both incidences to a girlfriend of mine over the phone as I was running errands. She chalked the first one up to always putting my friends above "boning" but she was entirely too interested in the second one for my taste. In fact, I believe the first words she said were,"Awww, look at you caring about someone else's feelings."

New Belgium - Like Odell, New Belgium has a very attractive brewery. Take the tour if you can, but plan ahead, you need reservations and they are usually booked weeks in advance. Most brewery tours are pretty boring, after you have been on a few they get repetitive and dull. Not here, they spend their time telling you about their awesome, innovative company and its story, not explaining how beer is made. When it comes time for your free samples, be sure to ask about Lips of Faith and other rarer offerings. They usually don't make it on the menu, but the bartenders will frequently give you a pour if you ask.

The last image shows a map of cognitive reasoning, reproduced here from the web, that needs further citations and analysis. As you can see, the idea of connecting these images together suggest that by understanding what regions of the brain are involved in affective and cognition states, one can gain insight into how to apply the idea that Lowenstein (2008) suggested based on Tugwell’s work that there is both an affective push and cognitive restraint that is operating within each Brodmann area. EEG signals might provide insights into the frequency behavior generated from Figure 4–good chapter on the Logarithmic spiral in Fischer (1993). Of course, diagonal thinking says that I should like to eat while I think (i.e. need the movement while sitting) and so does Figure 5.

I have been told by many well-meaning friends that I should act like the Father who willingly allowed His Son to be made of no reputation, even to the point that the Father gave His Son to be murdered on a cross....that I should "turn the other cheek"....and that the "Biblical Way" to handle this is privately. Please know I would love to have not been placed in a position where I had to deal with this at all, especially since I know Caleb is innocent of all charges made against him...but we were not given a forum for handling this privately. And to state the obvious, FCS has had plenty of time to withdraw Caleb's punishment, to apologize for over-reacting, and to reinstate Caleb fully. They haven't. To the surprise of many, not a single phone call has been extended to us. In fact, FCS has instead retained an attorney of their own as we have attempted to retrieve Caleb's school contract, get a written explanation of the expulsion, and work toward removing the expulsion from his permanent record. (We recently learned one of the school leaders is already embroiled in another legal battle).
Cozy mystery was a genre I wrote because I enjoy nothing better than sitting down with a good mystery. However, had I known how tough it is to write a mystery, I would have started with an easier genre! Still, the process was an eye-opening learning experience that forced me to rethink the way I plotted books. Even so, what I learned trumped the difficulty of writing the stories.

The hero must strive to deal with the problem. “The character should be striving against the forces of opposition, wanting to solve the problem. But it gets worse and worse and worse. It’s part of the classic fairy tale structure: the character tries one then a second thing then a third thing. It builds and builds and builds – until he or she is at the point of despair. It ends when everything is resolved by the character one way or another. You have a problem if your character is just reacting to the situation.”
The novel, rejected by everyone, is right now selling over 100 copies an hour, currently earning $3.50 a minute. That's $210 an hour, $5040 a day. And it seems to be picking up speed.
But know that our God still works miracles. When we trust Him with our whole lives and worship Him with our whole hearts it opens up a realm of the ,miraculous, the greatest miracle of all though is to trust in Him and to hear His voice.
Within that aloneness I can be very active to doing nothing, the thoughts that flicker across my mind like a film reel tend to go nowhere, as I let it wash over me and other times I’ll spend hours just simply reading or jotting down notes for the novel I may never write.
Another general difficulty as regards Tibetan literature is the religious element. Communists do not believe in religion; but the Tibetans, for their part, do not believe that tradition can be broken in a couple of decades.

Life can be a whole lot easier if we just get rid of, not only the vase, but the school situation too.
THE MISFITS (1961) was just on TCM and for a big chunk of it I was floored by its poetic train wreck qualities. Marilyn Monroe's performance has been woefully under appreciated in film criticism--she's been accused of being 'uneven'--but that's her character! It's a bi-polar character written for a bi-polar actress by her bi-polar husband as a divorce present. The whole idea of a divorce present is pretty bi-polar too. And then there's death. It doesn't get any more bi-polar than that. Death is where madness and marriage are finally reconciled.
This part of my bill mirrors Erin Merryn a bit. In Erin’s Law all children are required to have child sexual abuse education. What I believe has been absent was a specification on grooming with confusion and manipulation that takes place when perpetrators change the course of the relationship.

I can distinctly remember sitting in front of the television in San Francisco, while visiting extended family, glad to watch The Outer Limits as it was apparently my weekly habit to do so. I remember thinking, ah, I haven’t seen this one before and being quite excited to seeing a new episode. An episode having to do with a spaceship and someone dying, floating through space with a look of horror on his face. Wonderful stuff for a 6 year old.
After the laughter died down from the Chairman’s Nephew’s pristine roundhouse air kicks, Starkwell and Lovelock got bored. Real bored.

Lovelock says “I could go for a commercial right about now”.
And that’s all in less than two years. Angry Birds first surfaced in December 2009 on Apple’s iOS.

It stared at Night Watcher Six and gave its signature idiotic grin when it suddenly dodged into house number thirteen where Old Lun Eight lived. Now Night Watcher Six was really courageous and was not a bit least frightened. Quickly he ran up to house thirteen and banged on the door shouting,

Finally, I’ll say that the word immortal is used in a couple of ways in the book. Immortal can refer to the cells and their ability to grow in culture. It can also refer to something spiritual. As such, it is the word that perfectly emphasizes the disconnect between the doctors and scientists and the Lackses. Many of the scientists and doctors in the book, save for the courageous Christophe Lengauer, see only the scientific definition of the word. But the family struggles and desires to understand the spiritual side—that they believed their mother, a real person, was granted some sort of immortality. When her cousin sings and prays with Deborah, we witness a spiritual connection to Henrietta up close. We end the book knowing it is not just the cells that were immortal. It’s a beautiful moment.
Since we were put on the spot, we did not have much time to think, so we made a few regretable choices. We wish we would have chose Melbourne instead of Sydney for our destination because it is closer to Tasmania; we chose the date of November 1, when we really should have chosen December 1 or at least some date later in November. We thought November 1 was three months later since we did not have much time to think about the situation and I am horrible at math!

My truth comes from a long line of people who prefer to keep things hidden. And that’s okay - for them. I, on the other hand, prefer to leave no stone unturned. It helps pave the path for my healing if I can wipe away the old foundation and build a new road for myself.
As we walked into the house I was immediately overcome with the lovely, fragrant smell of dog pee. Well dog pee and Drakar. He turned to me, offered me something to drink then asked me if I wanted to go into his room and, yep, you guessed it... look at his clothes. At first I was nervous. I thought Oh my God, I hope he isn't bringing me here because he thinks I'm gonna..we're gonna...

Those were the best words and most frightening words. A week passed and no call. Another week passed and still no call. Everyone who cared told me that the job was mine, but nothing was final. Until November 15 came. That day, someone called the house while I was out. All I got when I arrived was a message that I should go to Pisay the next day. I had no idea who to go to.

This week I spotted yet another Hunger Games reader on the MTR. She may have actually been reading Catching Fire, the second book in the series, but it was hard to tell. A man on the train was intently studying Love and Respect: The Love She Most Desires, The Respect He Desperately Needs by Emerson Eggerichs. I spotted a teenager carrying a Nora Roberts book through Central and another woman reading an English paperback with a blue cover. I counted four Chinese books and one guidebook.

I’m going to end this post with a video that helped confirm my feelings that this disorder is real. We aren’t “attention seekers” but people who want to cope with life more effectively, but haven’t been able to…yet.
The medical ethics debate is the obvious jumping off point for discussion. Did the doctors have the right to take her cells and use them without her permission? Did she consent by giving the OK to be treated? Should patients have the right to tissue that they “abandon” at a medical facility? Did the family deserve some financial benefit from all the work done with their mother’s cells? I could go on, and it’s why this book is perfect for a book club. I didn’t have a difficult time with the ethics—tissue samples aren’t body parts and I don’t know that we maintain some rights to them once they leave our bodies. I shudder to think that people would find a way to capitalize their tissue if they felt it would be valuable. And that would have disastrous consequences for science. The tragedy here was that Henrietta’s family suffered so much in life (for reasons having nothing to do with the cells) and then when they found out about the cells, they were angry and confused and hurt. It does seem wrong that they lived in poverty without health insurance, and their mother’s cells made drug and science companies millions of dollars. But then, I think it is wrong that ANYONE lives in poverty and without health insurance.
Anyway, back to the card, the papers used were from a freebie Serif paper pack from a magazine, the pack is called 'picnic in the park', it seemed to work quite well with the image of popcorn eating strawberries. The doily in the background was created using my silhouette, so you will probably see more of these! The embossing folder was from a pack of border folders done by Docrafts/papermania (not sure what name they went under for this range). The strawberry embellishment I am most proud of as I created this from scratch using translucent shrink plastic, I drew a basic strawberry myself on paper first and then traced it onto the shrink plastic with my pilot drawing pen, then coloured with my speccies and shrank it (it nearly didn't work as the edges stuck together but I managed to get them apart).
Hot on the heels of this news, I realised that the final cover for the U.S. edition of Shadows on the Moon was up on the Amazon pre-order page. It's been up on various other websites for a while - NetGalley and Goodreads - but in a tiny thumbnail. Now, Candlewick had asked me not to put the artwork on my website until closer to the release date, so I've held back on that. But since we're now within a few months of U.S. publication, and the image is there in enlargeable form on both Amazon and the publisher's website, this seems as good a time as any for me to do a belated unveiling. So...
Costco to the rescue! For $7.99, you can design a greeting card and get 10 copies, along with pre-printed return address envelopes. Seriously, that is the cost of 2-3 cards at the Hallmark store these days. If you have more to send, you can do the greeting cards people send at Christmas, but with Valentine trim and wording. They are 50 for about $15.00. They come with unprinted envelopes. All you need to have is a Costco membership.

Superstructure – political systems, religion and the media
When I had my first child, I decided to leave my publishing job. I’d like to say it was a hard decision, but it wasn’t. I liked my job, but unless we were going to starve and lose our home (we were not) I wasn’t going to put that baby down. I don’t think I did actually put her down until about nine months later. I was that kind of new mom and she was that kind of baby.

Anyway... I wanted to share this because I feel like there are a lot of misconceptions about postpartum depression. You don't have to be hearing voices, be suicidal or want to hurt your babies. I felt none of those things. It can come on months after the actual birth. You can be smiling on the outside and still function to a certain extent. But inside you know something isn't right. You feel "off". Like the blood had been drained from your body and you've become a walking zombie. Like your hormones have a mind of their own. I was there. I'm spiraling out of it now. And I want other moms to be able to recognize it and get the help they need.

Dave (Charlie Chuck’s real name) told me more about his unbilled second show at the upcoming Edinburgh Fringe – Dave Kear’s Guide to the Universe – which I blogged about last week and which he will perform in theSpaces@SurgeonsHall for six days. He has plans to develop this year’s show into an hour-long play called Mister Nobody at the 2012 Fringe and has been discussing with a 1960s ‘celebrity vicar’ what that might involve.
When I first learned that we were each going to file an access to information request, I was a bit hesitant as I did not know what to expect from the process or what the impact was going to be. I was concerned that making the request would put me on the government’s radar. This might have been because I’ve read too many conspiracy theories or something, but I felt like I was going to become a part of counter law II and I would be surrounded by security assemblages. I felt that making this request would make the government want to look into me to find out why I was making this request. I figured they would mine my data double, from my Facebook to emails, to try figure out who I was and what interest I had in this information. Looking back on it now, I realize that this was a bit of an exaggeration. After doing some research, I realized that Access to Information requests is a part of the democratic process. Furthermore, after reading the Access to Information and Privacy section of the CSIS website (to whom I was writing my request) and also being told by Mike that names of those who undertake requests are not disclosed to anybody but the ATIP coordinator at the particular agencies were the request is sent, my fears were eased and I was not as hesitant to undertake the process.
This picture all happened kind of quickly, a lot of experimentation happening on the go. I just disengaged my brain for a little while and allowed my hand to just move freely and see what happens. The eye sideways reminded me of a seed a little bit in the ground if you were to look at it as a cross-section through the earth.

First thing you’ll notice is that the chart is broken down on the outside rim in time blocks. For clarity sake I set it up in three hour wedge shaped increments. You could go all the way to 24 if you wanted. It should always be in a 24 hour format however. The next thing you’ll notice is that it’s got rings inside of it. Each ring represents a day of the week. So what we have here is a simple calendar. But not so simple it isn’t effective.

Just a little tip - I lined the hearts up on the acrylic block and stamped them all at the same time so that I could be sure they were lined up perfectly. I probably should have added the sentiment at the same time, but I didn't think of that beforehand.
I've had a pretty rough 2 years, but 2012 is going to be different. I haven't felt that the last two years. I think I even faked it a time or two and tried to make other people believe that. This year I believe it. I'm a Star Trek Next Generation fan, so my next statement will only sound stupid if you don't watch that show.
I thought overall the dancing in the second one was really good - it was a bit more intense than the first for sure, and the girl could definitely dance better. Which I mean, is likely because she’s a professional dancer was a dancer on Dancing With the Stars for a few years, but still.
When all was said and done one of the plantation “supervisors” took me by the Sagua la Grande River where he proceeded to brush my hair and turn off cigarette buds in my arm and thighs. I decide to make a run for it then partially because I didn’t approve of the brand. When I finally made it down to the end of the path I saw a little cottage, sort of leaning on a tree beside it. I knocked only twice, I’m not Eliza Dushku therefore a wrong turn would’ve been fatal. There was an old lady inside, crunched over a ball of yarn and a stuffed cat. She looked up at me briefly then went back to fiddle with her knitting needles and the hissing silence.
Man-centered reasoning says that if there is opposition to God’s work, He must not want us to continue. However, God-centered reasoning says that if God has commanded it, He will make a way to overcome all opposition.

Whatever the reason, I think the idea of opening with a question originated with the short teaser ads that local news operations inject into prime-time programming. They want to lure you into staying up late with the promise of some sensational breaking story, when all they really have for a lead is the new garbage pickup schedule.
Responsibility is also a very restrictive force. Consider the parent who takes their children to a play center only to discover that the noise levels and social anxiety are pushing them to the verge of a meltdown. It isn't simply a case of leaving because the kids can't be left alone in such a place.

And they watched very quietly. Companies like Lulu and others advertised "Self-Publishing", "POD" and "Vanity Publishing". Call it what you will that is what it was called in those days. The term "Indie" did not exist. And it was "self publishing". And while the publishers and agents were waiting for the soup to be delivered at their little party, Amazon went ahead and started watching the growth of these companies. The public began to vote with their wallets. Sure, 99.9% of those books were not used for anything and never got read, but, and this but is huge, people were saying, "I don't care! I want my book published, and waiting around to try and find an agent and a publisher is futile." Is Lulu and others like it, a publisher? Or are they just glorified printing machines? Hmmm....well we will look at that further in this article.

Shortly after Nifong removed himself from the case, the Bar amended its ethics complaint against him. Focused on his decision to enter into an intentional agreement with Dr. Meehan to withhold exculpatory evidence, the Bar accused Nifong of not only massive ethics violations, but also of repeatedly lying to the court, breaking three state laws, and violating the Constitution. In many ways, the disgraced DA was his own enemy: he offered no fewer than 11 separate (and often mutually contradictory) explanations for the decision to withhold the DNA.

Lagers, as a broad category, are those beers which employ a bottom-fermenting yeast, operative primarily in cooler temperatures. Before the advent of refrigeration, top-fermenting beers (ales) were the only ones produced, and those mostly in the fall or spring, and only in temperate climates. If the weather were too cold or hot, the yeast would not perform it's duty. Lagering, which is a German term meaning to store, was discovered somewhat accidentally when German brewers stored their spring beers in very cold caves during the summer months. With the advent of biochemistry and isolation of specific strains of yeast that best operated in colder environments, a whole new style of beer was born. These tended to be lighter beers, and flavors were much cleaner and refined.
Unlike other people I know, I am a loyal Southwest customer. To someone who typically flies Delta or any other airline the concept of not being able to pick your seat ahead of time is bothersome at best. For me though, I like the idea of only having to pay an extra $10 to check in early or I can just wait until 24 hours right before my flight and then check in online. The earlier you check in that determines what letter (A-C) and number (1-60) that you are on your ticket. You board accordingly and choose whatever seat it is that you want to sit on. You can check two bags for free and are allowed two carry-on bags. The plane is also brightly colored and while this may not matter to some, I have always thought that search and rescue workers would be able to find the plane if it went down, but that is my theory.

Research done by the National Institute of Health in 2006 found that one in every 110 eight-year old children were diagnosable for an ASD, and that among non-Hispanic white children, the rate increased to one in 101. Additional studies have shown that the disorder may debilitate some cognitive functions while enhancing others, though there doesn’t appear to be a definitive explanation.

It took me ages before I heard the cover version and it happened to be in a trendy bar in Edinburgh no less (Drewbeck and I were the only ones drinking a proper pint). After sitting there and listening to it whilst mocking what Biffy had become I came to the conclusion that the X-Factor version was better than the original because it was more realised. It knew what it wanted to be and just went for it. They turned a bland song that wanted to be a generic pop song into said full blown generic pop song.

After a few days, I got in touch with booking.com, through whom we’d booked, asking where our refund was. They told me to call Hawkrigg – but Hawkrigg, it appears, no longer answer the phone. They said they’d look into it. They called me back to say that they couldn’t get through as no-one was answering the phone. A week later, we got an email. The owner was now saying she never promised us a refund: our refusal to pay was now her generous gesture of compensation. Unhappy, I contacted them again; the same reply. Again and again and again I went to booking.com who went to Hawkrigg who said I was lying. Finally, we got an email about 5 or 6 weeks after our disastrous stay: she would’ve refunded the deposit but we’d smoked in the room and the £50 was to cover ‘fumigation’ costs. I stopped emailing then. Not because I was guilty (yes, we smoke, but in non-smoking establishments we go outside, just like we do at friends’ houses and just as we do at home, choosing to not smoke in our own house), but because I was taken aback: how could someone lie like that? How can you reason with someone, how can you hold someone to account, how can you appeal to the better nature of someone who is willing to lie to get out of repaying money owed? It made me wonder: when did it become OK to lie, and when did it become OK to steal?

Not only are you causing devastation to our communities and our British way of life with your Al Qaeda Heroin, but you are making yourself vast sums of money for Al Qaeda’s ‘war chest’ in the process of killing our youth, which is then used to further your Jihad against us in other ways. It is about time that this unlimited supply of wealth and deadly destruction against us that is in the hands of Al Qaeda’s British born army on the streets of Luton & Dunstable was stamped out!

Before I delve into the subject at hand, I want to shed some light onto the mindset of 19th century Victorian England, where ideas and concerns mirrored what we will see in our mid 20th century. The Victorian periodical publishing aspect I speak of is not comic books, but the entire parallel genre of children's literature which came of age in the Victorian era and where the preoccupation with childhood manifested itself in the books and magazines produced for the young. As more and more children of the middle class joined the upper class in reading, prominent literary critics of the time played leading roles as arbiters of taste and morality, especially against what was deemed the lowest rung of printed reading matter, the penny dreadfuls, the reading entity of the working class.
Two Decembers ago I was on Orchard Road, the main thoroughfare in the island-city of my birth, Singapore. At the very head of Orchard Road was a giant sleigh with a sign reminding me that this display was brought to me by Visa. Indeed, Visa would receive our oblations, our worshipful thanks, and our true worship. As for Christ, He was to be remembered on one day alone, the 25th. And what an odd way to be remembered, by giving gifts to ourselves instead of Him!
Perhaps the most serious problem about this revival is that, despite its obvious satirical intentions, the work seems extraordinarily outdated and unnecessarily coy today. For those who have never seen the musical, I'll briefly relay the plot: window washer J. Pierrepont Finch, enters the executive suites of the World Wide Wicket Corporation in search of a job, armed with a little book that promises immediate success, How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying. Within minutes he has literally bumped into the president of company, J. B. Biggley, encountered a woman, Rosemary Pilkington, who falls in love with him at first sight, and captures a job in the mailing room by transforming the unpleasant encounter with Biggley into what the employment head interprets as a friendship.
My Experience: I feel that the Beamz Player is the most innovative product on the current market. It inspires creativity on a level that appeals to children and adults alike, as the user-friendly design is certain to create a sense of accomplishment and an appreciation toward music. There is nothing else like it on the market. It is the first of its kind and will become one of those items that you are delighted to share with others! It is something that must be used with a computer, so fair warning: If you don't have computer that you can dedicate to the use of this product, it might be wise to get one, as everyone is going to want to play it! It is a little steep in price for some, but when I priced a guitar, drum set and violin (all of which my daughter wanted for Christmas), it put it into perspective how reasonable the price actually is--not to mention--NO LESSONS! We found it so easy to use and it became an immediate hit with the entire family! I especially like the fact that it is simple enough for a beginner, but challenging enough for an expert musician to enjoy! I highly recommend it and give it my seal of approval!!

Chef Nathan Lyon is known to television viewers across the country for his simple, innovative cuisine featuring fresh, seasonal, local ingredients. Chef and co-host of Growing A Greener World (PBS), Nathan was the creator and host of A Lyon in the Kitchen (Discovery Health and Fit TV), among the final four on the second season of The Next Food Network Star, and appeared as a guest chef and expert on Home Made Simple (TLC) and Real Simple Real Life (TLC). After graduating from James Madison University with a Bachelor of Science in Health Science and a minor in Public Health, Nathan backpacked his way across Europe, learning about local customs, culture, and cuisine. Although every town and country along Nathan’s journey provided its own culinary lesson, the watershed moment occurred in an outdoor market just outside of Florence, Italy: an old woman, agog at the massive amount of produce Nathan was stockpiling, eagerly asked, “Why are you buying so much food? Why not just buy fresh every day?” Nathan immediately dumped out half his basket and began pondering those two simple questions. It was in that market, clutching a wheel of cheese, that Nathan discovered his truth: great food starts fresh. Laden with ideas and information, Nathan headed home, eventually opting for culinary school at Le Cordon Bleu in Los Angeles, where he earned a Culinary Arts degree. Since that time, Nathan has worked in many restaurants, both in and out of the kitchen, and has also worked with local growers in California farmers markets for over a decade. Nathan recently (December 2011) came out with his very first cookbook, Great Food Starts Fresh, which has been quoted by Alice Waters and Graham Kerr, in addition to other esteemed chefs. Great Food Starts Fresh is a seasonal cookbook featuring 135 recipes broken down into the 5 seasons: spring, summer, autumn, winter, and... chocolate!

Mrs Maple, aged like a fine beer in an oak casket, stood behind the counter at the Epsum Illum cafe, same way she always stood, half crooked from her left leg which was shorter than the right. She didn’t move or speak until Obadiah had seated himself at one of the stools other side of the counter and spent a good ten minutes looking at the bedraggled laminated menu. When he’d finally looked up from it, having decided to go for the house omelette in preference to the steak, the only other option on the menu, she’d snatched a half clean cup without shifting her position and deftly poured him a coffee. Obadiah nodded his thanks and pointed a grubby finger at his choice of food on the one page laminate.

You see, my heritage is primarily central European and my great-grandmother starved to death during the First World War. Finishing everything on one’s plate was a standard dining table requirement when I was growing up, as was eating pretty much anything you were given – whether you liked it or not. So I find myself sitting here with my body wisdom saying one thing and my conditioned learning saying another. Sometimes it’s like being caught in crossfire! Of course, common sense says “listen to your body” but I’m struck at how forceful and insistent conditioned learning is – and how hard it is to undo.

The building (The Palais de Luxembourg) used to belong to Marie de Medici who had it built in 1615 as a modest country home for herself and her son, Louis XIII.

JNG: A lot of people would say honesty, integrity... and I suppose I should too, but in all honesty I most admire people who are confident and outspoken. Confidence in yourself and your abilities makes you magnetic, and I've always found myself drawn to friends and men who know how to make their voice heard... I got a crush on a guy in high school that I'd never even spoken to before when he stood up at a club meeting and spoke on topic so eloquently and confidently that I remember, at 15, being like "...whoa." And I've always been drawn to people like that, so at the heart of it all, more than anything I admire confidence.
My mind has come back and back to it, over the years, though. As a kid, I used to imagine what sort of person Nasib, this sister my grandpa had lost, this aunt I didn't have, was.

We were introduced to Alvin Martin, Parish Manager, who was so very helpful in showing us around and identifying some of my unidentified old family photos of Sam's work that matched with some of the pieces in the church. Being Jewish, I'm not that familiar with some of the names of the pieces and what they represent or symbolize. Alvin was quite helpful in explaining. The pieces of the puzzle were starting to come together.
The bad thing is Scream 4’s weakness is the strength of the other installments--the returning cast. Sidney, Dewey, and Gail are back for a fourth go around with a brand new Ghostface who needs yet another reason to murder his victims. Seriously, what do these guys and girls have to have done in life to get three different people willing to don a costume in order to murder them? Someone else thinks Sidney has ruined his life enough to merit murdering her? Geez, hon. Maybe its you who are the problem. Not that I could blame sweet Neve Campbell for anything. I still have a thing for her lingering from the ‘90’s.
The photo above comes from a building I never fail to forget exists. It's tucked into the beginning or end of Nevins street. I would love to know Nevin's history but I don't save for the fact that the Fox Studios theater was here in the 30's

Expectations kill love. Expecting something from someone else is not loving. Love is not quid pro quo (yes, I am a lawyer). This is love – not that we love God, but that he loved us, and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. (1 John 4:10) Love is willing self-sacrifice for the good of another that does not require reciprocation or that the person being loved is deserving. (Paul David Tripp, “What Did You Expect?) God didn’t expect anything from us. He just loved us. We were the most unloving and the most undeserving.
I finish this post with a closing that Saint John of Avila used in the same letter to the invalid woman:

The bit of news below is good, I think, on many levels. About five years ago our then Superintendent of Business signed up the HDSB to participate in a “Cashless Schools” pilot. There was a need (and still is) for school boards to be fiscally accountable for all funds passing through their institutional hands regardless of source. Way back then, insightful companies like Amazon were moving their businesses online because their vision told them that in a busy world, convenience would drive the market to their store and that online would become the norm.

I have nothing too interesting to report. Everyone in the group has been getting along well. So far there has been no sub divisions or mutinies. Most of the power rests firmly on my shoulders as I seem to be the one organising our days and everyone else just seems happy to follow. I spend most of my nights going from one campsite to the next trying to sort out what everyone wants to do, which invariably ends up being what Ben and I had planned to do.
I love ribbon, but as a new crafter, I don't have an extensive assortment of colors and styles.

And even though Uncle Scrooge is villainous (charging 80% interest…which would make most loan sharks more friendly in setting their vig) he is not completely a victim of his circumstance, unlike the character in Dickens, but as Jiminy Cricket/ The ghost of Christmas past points out that he was the one responsible for creating his life. (Free will was never a big thing for Dickens in any of his stories). Also, unlike the original, this Scrooge doesn’t take much convincing. Two minutes looking at Tiny Tim and he’s already utterly concerned for the boy’s well-being. In the real story Scrooge is only finally convinced by the fires of hell.

I honestly am fine with not having a lot of homeschool friends here. I would love to have close homeschooling friends but it's just not happening. Actually, what I'm having trouble with is finding people who actually want to discuss home education and ideas. The homeschoolers only want to chit chat about the weather and other small talk. No one around here has real homeschool support group meetings where topics are discussed. When I need homeschool support I phone my Connecticut friends for a chat.

Choose the thread colour for quilting - I went with thread to match each fabric colour but you could easily use tangerine on your neutral chevrons and neutral on your tangerine fabric for a different look. Don't forget to consider the back as well. In retrospect I wish I'd only used tangerine thread on the back (bobbin thread) so the quilting stood out even more on my neutral backing. We live and learn, huh?

Doesn't feel like Tuesday today. I guess that's because yesterday was Family Day here in Alberta, so now I'm one day off this week. ;o) I do wish that extra day to the weekend meant I accomplished more sewing, but it didn't. Instead I enjoyed a long weekend of family time, which I cherish.

I want to specifically thank Mark and Doug for coming to pray with me, and for the many times that both of you have lifted me up in prayer over the last couple of weeks. Thank you Doug for just being Doug, and knowing me, and caring for me. You were there right when I needed you, right when I was able to process the information that was being given to me. You helped me see how God had provided for me when all that I could focus on was that I wasn’t fixed. Maybe I am just being selfish in thinking this, but maybe God has kept you at our church just because he knew that I would need you. I even want to thank you for the analogies related to your cath lab days that make me squirm in my seat in ABF – those analogies and the things you had to say to us are what made me talk to my doctor. Thank you for your friendship, and for your constant concern for our family.

It should be said that the CBI has adjusted the Rest of World deposit figures for All Irish banks and the following increases to the figures have been identified – January 2012 (+716m), December 2011 (+727m), November 2011 (+701m), October 2011 (+675m), September 2011 (+693m), August 2011 (+576m), July 2011 (+192m). The CBI was asked a month ago about these adjustments but there was no response. Perhaps the next time someone has an opportunity to speak with Governor Honohan, they might ask why his Bank is altering past figures and do they think people won’t notice.

8 Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, inEden; and there he put the man he had formed. 9 And the Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground — trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
“Let the wind blow,” remarks St. Francis de Sales, “and do not mistake the rustling of leaves for the clashing of arms. Be perfectly convinced that all the temptations of hell are powerless to defile a soul that does not love them. St. Paul endured terrible temptations, yet God, through love, did not deliver him from them.” Quadrupani suggests this: “Look upon God as an infinitely good and tender father and believe that He only allows the devil to try His children that their merits may increase and their recompense be correspondingly greater.”

What if another mother were sitting in that waiting room with her well-behaved child, that did not have an extra chromosome, and it was my child with the extra chromosome that was acting up? Would she just assume it was because of Down syndrome? How about my parenting skills be the reason? This would probably not cross a person's mind because so many people think kids with Down syndrome all act the same. So far from the truth...really. I truly believe from the bottom of my heart so much has to do with parenting. Yes, some things we cannot control but there are many things we, as parents, can do to help our kids behavior. For all our kids, not just those blessed with the extra. I wanted to scream to those other adults in the room yesterday...just be a parent...put down your phones...or simply "just pay attention to them." Oh my do I try not to sit and judge but when these little kids get in your business and in your stuff and those parents do not care, it is hard not to get a little frustrated thinking "if I can keep my kid with Down syndrome sitting here quietly, you can certainly at least make an effort to keep your kids under control."

Playing of the big three games very briefly and casually is actually more satisfying in the short term than trying to play one game solidly. Initially I would doubt that to be true. In a nutshell I think being moderate has pushed my expectations, and I now find the small elements of fun amongst a range of games. For now its working. I am looking forward to the official release of Diablo so that I can see the full content and play online with some friends that it is hard to hook up with in other games. I would still like to get SWToR loaded and play that in the future when my PC has been upgraded, as the content was impressive enough that I think it will be a fantastic distraction.

January 11 - E Howard Hunt pleads guilty to all charges. It was surmised at the time that he pled so to keep potential evidence and testimony against him out of the trial. Also, around the time of the actual burglary his wife had perished in an airplane crash. With her at the crash site was also found a large check from CREEP. Both his perceived grief from his wife's passing and his wish to keep her from being sullied were thought to impact his plea decision as well.

As the labor progressed, three things helped me more than anything else: Alex fed me ice chips, which were hugely refreshing. He put cold damp paper towels on my forehead and wiped my face during each contraction, which felt wonderful and helped distract me from the intense pressure. Most of all, I responded enormously to his positive encouragement. He’d say things like, “You’re doing a great job; you're so amazing; I'm so proud of you; our sweet baby boy is coming into the world because of you.” (Those words still make me tear up!) Every time he’d say something buoying, I’d feel a huge new wave of energy. I was amazed at how well positive encouragement helped, and I was so grateful to him.
He was pretty mad that we kept trying to put his hood on and take pictures. This is the best we got last night!
On April the 19th 2011, Sony became aware that the Playstation Network (PSN) and their Qriocity service had been compromised, leading to unauthorised access to customer’s information. This led to them shutting down the 2 networks the following day as a precaution. Without mentioning the hack, they explained that the disruption was being taken care of and that it’d be “A full day or two” before the switches were flipped and services would resume as normal. A week later, they admitted there’d been a breach and 27 days later, in a staggered roll-out, the new and improved PSN was unleashed on the world.

The WiseGuy spent most of the meet at Turf Paradise re-examining programming to find a better evaluation technique in picking the winners using the exclusive ROD handicapping we developed. That didn’t work well in the beginning and SOMEHOW the original scheme was lost, overwritten and forgotten. Then things went spiraling downward and tickets were hitting the floor like someone had shot a white goose with a shotgun in the clubhouse. This disaster started in early November of 2011 and after hitting some little ones for 50 bucks every so often I thought I’d go back to square one. That’s when I discovered that changing the program was a bad idea, a really bad idea. So after all these months of excruciating trial and error to get back to the original formulation schemes, we finally made it about a couple of weeks ago and things began to look up for the WiseGuy.

The statuesque Dalila Di Lazzaro (Phenomena) may not utter a single word as the repeatedly poked and prodded female zombie in Flesh for Frankenstein, but the profound length of her legs, the unequaled symmetry of her refined Italian features, and her overall gorgeousness more than made up for her lack of verbalized dialogue. Besides, what kind of dialogue would she have uttered anyway? Other than: "My nipples are chilly, could someone get me a sweater?" or "I was wondering, yeah, is there anyway I could get my modesty patch upgraded? It's making my pussy itch like a motherfucker," I can't think of anything her character might want to express orally. No, I think stone-faced and well-proportioned was the way to go for Miss Di Lazzaro, as it gave her female zombie a real sense of muted disquietude.

She tasted amazing, this perfect queen he had created. Christian’s tongue delighted in the familiar taste of her blood, drinking a little more from her than he normally would. Feeling his own finish coming on, Christian quickly pulled away from Addison’s neck and pushed her face into his own. Christian gritted his teeth as he felt her bite, the overwhelming pleasure making his eyes roll back as she drank from him.
I sensed he was lying from the way his eyebrows twitched as he spoke. After some diligent detective work, I discovered that the only metal plates in his backside were those he stuffed into his underpants before putting on his costume. To teach him a lesson, I entered the ring with a large mallet in hand and smashed his buttocks like a pair of cymbals. The audience loved it.

The protesters are still not demanding a new form of communist civilization, and the left which is lead by the old guard is not guiding the protesters toward the communist vision of Karl Marx. It is important for the youth not to fear a temporary slide backwards in economic well-being, instead it is more important to implement the foundations of a new communist civilization. In Chapter 2 of the Communist Manifesto Marx made it clear that the communists might want to introduce an openly legalized community of women. According to Marx, this meant that there would be a new system of wives in common. The public square must be a forum not just for free speech but a forum in which men and women have equal access to each other so as to satisfy any sexual desires and in order to prevent favoritism and attachment to one person from arising as that would lead back to the current model of competition and capitalist enslavement.

I'd say the only people who could/should be pissed off or alarmed by this are the regional brewers like Greene King, Marston's and Wells & Young's, who now face a serious new contender. It's going to be interesting to see how they react.
The parents rarely go for independent verification, either, so that the legitimacy of the communication can be verified. Nor are videos going to be shot so that you can see everything going on. And you're just not going to get people who've bought into the claims of FC to reconsider their positions, regardless of the harm FC causes. Dr. Todd writes eloquently of this at Science 2.0.
Have you checked out the most recent issue of Adore home? I was rather taken with this image. One of my clients recently purchased a set of bamboo chairs from Stuff and we are looking for a fun Chinoiserie fabric to cover the seats.

This jam is best made with fresh juicy strawberries right off the vine, but the store bought ones will work. The store bought ones don't squish as well as the vine ripened ones, so you may have to pulse them a couple of times in the food processor (but not too much... you want some chunks of strawberries).

I play the character of Jim. He is an amazingly talented phone and cable technician. Jim is a longtime local who knows the area and surrounding areas very well. Jim provides insight to Brian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) on the history of Texas City and “The Killing Fields”. And with his fantastic technician skills he plays a somewhat integral part in the development of the case. Basically, I solve the whole thing! Jim is amazing!!! I kid, of course…mostly.

I got dressed, I flopped back in bed, I tried to read, I tried to relax with a cooking show until I “figured it out”. It was so incredibly uncomfortable. I considered closing all the curtains and trying to go to sleep until the afternoon. There’s so much to do, so much to write. The places I’ve been, the people met, the food happily eaten in the past few weeks… but how do you do anything on a day like this?

And a second entry for "the good": last night's dinner. How many of you were readers of the late, lamented Gourmet Magazine? My guess is most of you. It kills me that when I sold my house in 2008 to move in with my now-husband, I recycled almost a hundred issues of Gourmet because I didn't want to move them. I figured that there were plenty more issues to come, right? A year later Gourmet stopped publication.
It is peculiar that climate coverage since 2009, when the U.S. House of Representatives passed a climate bill, has plummeted on the big four television networks. Especially since a recent New York Times poll found that the public has linked extreme weather to global warming. Given that in March 2012, more than 15,000 warm temperature records were eclipsed, dating back to 1895 (that’s 1,400 months), why wouldn’t the public start to connect the dots?

So I was looking at the flood picture of the Opry stage that first week, and in my head seeing clearly what the stage looked like from the floor, standing in the third or fourth row in from the stage that night in 1983. Remembering that I was looking, basically, up – since I’m short anyway, but still, it was relatively high off the floor.
An extended use of this literal meaning—applied to airplanes with big rear ends—was recorded in the military beginning in 1945. Both the OED and the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang have citations from that time, when a plane with a large tail section (especially the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress) was referred to as a “big-ass bird” or “big-assed bird.”

Regarding the first proposition, I still fully support everything I wrote in ‘WIAaV’, and I believe that my arguments are still valid. I listed four reasons, in ascending order of importance, why I am a vegetarian. It is cheaper, it is healthier for the body, it is healthier for the environment, and it is the higher ethical, or moral, position. I do not believe that any of these arguments can be refuted, and any one of them should ideally be enough to convince a rational person of abandoning a diet built around the consumption of dead animal flesh. There is only a growing body of evidence in support of each of these arguments, some of which I briefly outlined in the original post, and much more of which can be found quite easily on the internet. The only excuse for not adhering to a vegetarian diet at this point would seem to be ignorance of the benefits and costs, which cannot be claimed by any of the readers here. Basically, the issue with my earlier post is that I did not go far enough in stating the case for not using animal products of any kind. This is because, at the time of writing, I was still only a vegetarian, but not someone who rejected the use of milk, cheese, eggs, honey, and other things. In light of further information I have become aware of, and more thinking on the subject, I have completed the evolution from vegetarian to vegan–that is, someone who chooses not to use animal products of any kind.

We woke up this morning and got some chores done--not before I enjoyed my my pumpkin spice K-cup, of course. Then mom and I hit up our favorite annual craft show. It's been a tradition for the two of us for a few years now. It's tightly packed. It's a little loud. It's usually a little cold. But it's always a blast. And we always find the cutest gifts or Christmas decor. Mom bought this lantern for me--isn't it gorgeous?

It is arguable whether either Morecambe or Wise would have made it on his own but my money would have been on Eric over Ernie. In Living with the Truth there is a scene where an excerpt from a Shakespeare play is enacted and I really do very little to the dialogue but I have the character of Truth play his part in the style of Eric Morecambe and two or three people have commented on this scene saying it’s the funniest thing in the book. It really isn’t but Morecambe is the kind of comic who could read the telephone directory and you’d end up in stitches. The whole scene in the book relies on the reader’s relationship with the real life Morecambe.

and in September 2010 we had the opportunity to go to the FSU vs. BYU game. Nick was very respectful in Michigan, usually making his comments under his breath so that Michigan fans couldn't hear, but embarrassingly he wasn't so quiet at the FSU BYU game. At one point, with several BYU fans sitting in front of us, and with FSU well ahead in the game he would yell things like "BYU go back to Provo!" This was much to the chagrin of most of the BYU fans sitting around us, especially one who, after Nick yelled that gem, turned around, stared at Nick, and then got up and left as Nick cackled like a nut.
At first, I had a hard time to think of what to put in for my blog’s header for this month to replace the previous one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the sinking of Titanic in April 1912. There is no big event or things going on in this May, and that delayed me on creating the new header. Finally, I thought of, why not creating a header based on the culture of blogging. Ahh, and there comes my work for that 18cm x 5cm header at the top of my blog, which I have to work on a new one every month. That’s an extra work for me as a blogger to provide a new refreshing header appearance to my blog’s readers every month. Below, you can see another copy of my header of May 2012.

I remember one day missing Bear so bad I sat on the floor of her room, curled in a ball, holding her baby blanket just sobbing. The kind where you feel like you are going to puke. All her toys were starting to collect dust and life seemed on pause. When children are kidnapped or die young, I don’t completely understand but, I have an idea of what that parent goes through. Life on pause. I just needed to feel the weight of her in my arms, trace her chubby fingers with mine. Breathe her in. Whisper in her ear I was trying everything for her. Dustin came home from work to find me there. He just sat next to me and started silently crying. He didn’t break down often but he did that night. We sat there for a long time, surrounded by smiling Pooh and Tigger, as the sun set, just sobbing. A 23 yr old and 24 yr old just trying to tackle the worst case scenario.

I use DVD Profiler to track my DVDs and have since 2002. This lets me keep track of what DVDs I own, when I purchased them, when I watched them and with who, etc. Since I had some time today, I went through and updated some records. I removed everyone who has died or moved away as an active user and went through the list and made sure everything I had watched was recorded as such. I went through a few periods where I forgot to write that stuff down. Once I was done, I took stock of my collection. I own the following:
In many ways large publishers will find it harder to adapt than smaller independent publishers or publishers starting from scratch. Right now, no-one can say what the perfect or effective model required to take on these challenges is, but one innovative way of finding out is by following closely a publishing project being launched on Publishr. Publishr is a blog for essays and discussion on the future of publishing. The publishing project itself is the brainchild of Brett Sandusky, Digital Marketing Manager with Kaplan Publishing.

Although I'm used to this kind of weird working schedule, a small knot of dread accompanies me with late-night gigs. There's no way to avoid the fact of circadian rhythm, which for most people means slowed thinking processes, tardy reaction times and skewed decision-making. It's the reason pilots must have certain periods of rest between duties, and why the accident rate skyrockets for shift workers. In a potential bomb like a fully-laden limousine, mistakes can be fatal, and with lots of drunk passengers, it's easy to go wrong too.

As U.S. companies continue to expand in the market, however, so too does the risk of non-compliance with the confusing web of U.S. laws and regulations that govern export-related activities. U.S. law places the burden of complying with export controls and economic sanctions squarely on U.S. companies and their officers and employees. The cybersecurity industry is no exception, and may be particularly vulnerable to government scrutiny given the strategic need to protect U.S. technological advantages, critical infrastructure, and access to confidential information. In this regard, violating U.S. export laws can result in criminal law enforcement actions, jail time, and significant fines and penalties, including debarment from federal contracting.

This category has five titles listed because there was a tie on number of votes and first place choices. Generally a very quiet category for recommendations; last year I think the longlist was shorter than the shortlist, though I might be misremembering! Good job no one went for the SF Encyclopedia – I was kicking myself the day after voting for not recommending it – or the jury would have had an awful lot to read. It’s funny how I’m more surprised by the things that I didn’t vote for that didn’t get in, than I am by the things I did vote for that didn’t get in. This looks like a very readable shortlist to me.

I must say it turned out beautifully and just how I was hoping it would. The chandelier from IKEA also made a big difference. The plastic light that was in there before was just hideous.

So, admittedly this is all very speculative at present. Why go over it? Because liberals know they have nothing to actually run on so they’re trying to kill the hope of Obama’s defeat early on and ruin Romney’s momentum. Don’t fall for it.

The Operational Area (AO) for our purposes is going to be the area we primarily defend PLUS areas of interest connected to it. An Area defense is a defense that encompasses just that – an area. A point defense for our purposes is a static location – i.e. your homestead. We’ll get into point defenses much later on. For now lets concentrate on Areas. I’ll tell you right up front – this is not word for word .mil terrain assessment or IPB – that’s not the point here. The IPB is a complex process and this draws elements from it however to go into the IPB would be a complete waste of time when you could read an FM. This is presented as an educational tool for the complete novice.

Cherry clafoutis is a classic French dessert--for those unfamiliar with it, it's pretty much a baked custard, usually served family-style in a large dish. Cherries are the traditional fruit of choice for a clafoutis: the sweet tartness of the fruit is perfectly balanced by the creamy custard, making it a light and simple dessert for many occasions.

The combat takes the revamped system in Mass Effect 2 and brings back weapon mods. There are a greater number of weapons for weapon type which can all be upgraded increasing its stats. All weapons have weight which affects the speed your skill’s cooldown rate. As in Mass Effect 1, skills have six tiers with each level improving the skill. Skills can be passive, offensive or supportive. You spend skill points you gain when you level and when skill reaches level four you have one of two options for upgrading. You can have one skill for you and your squad assigned to quick buttons.
I’ve been single for about 4 months now and I’ve developed a crush on my neighbor Emily. She is a Bog Fritillary. She is beautiful from antenna to hindwing. The vibrant colors, and her proboscis.

And her reply:
Florence + The Machine's Shake It Off. WOW...seriously how is it her music can reach so deep inside of me and grab every fiber of my being and give it a jolt of much needed electricity? This is the kind of song you crank up at eardrum busting volume and dance like you're on fire around the house to.
As you raise your spiritual vibration, remember that laughter, joy and playfulness help you to manifest your desires. It is that energy that is manifesting energy. When you feel such love and such joy, take a moment, lay on the grass and look up at the beautiful sky and just feel the aliveness of that moment. Then, imagine how you would feel when you reach that point you choose, and see that these are the same energetically. So infuse your desires with that energy right now and carry it with you always.

Stat-wise, it actually has the lowest base stat total of event legendaries; they’re usually at 600, while Keldeo only has 580. It has good Sp Attack (the highest of all Fighting types) and Speed. Its Attack is decent, but not great. A lot of moves it can learn by level-up are physical though (especially Fighting moves), but it does learn Swords Dance by level-up to boost its Attack. It has a Signature Move, Secret Sword (not to be confused with Sacred Sword, which is learned by all the musketeers), that it only gets it from the event (though I imagine by event is the only legit way to get a Keldeo anyway).
