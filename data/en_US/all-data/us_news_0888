"Magic Mike": Will it join the ranks of arty character studies like "American Gigolo" or bizarre guilty pleasures like "Showgirls"? Either way, "Magic Mike" is one of the most anticipated arrivals for fans of quirky material. Director Steven Soderbergh, whose quality credentials are secure, directs a story inspired by actor/heartthrob Channing Tatum's past job as a stripper. Aside from the classic Patrick Swayze/Chris Farley "SNL" skit about a Chippendales audition, male exotic dancers have not been the subject of many TV or movie projects -- even as they've remained a staple of bachelorette parties. Tatum portrays an experienced dancer, while Alex Pettyfer plays a newcomer. Also in the cast: Olivia Munn and shirtless wonder Matthew McConaughey. (June 29)

Congressional districts - which will grow from 25 to 27 because of population gains - also become slightly safer for Republicans. One local example is the redrawn seat in Orange and Lake counties held by U.S. Rep. Dan Webster, R-Winter Garden. His current District 8 seat is 39 percent Democratic and 36 percent Republican by registration. But the new one would be 40 percent GOP and 37 percent Democratic - and more importantly, it would shift from one that voted for President Barack Obama and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink to one that voted GOP in both races.

Even if your symptoms stop completely in less than five minutes, call your doctor. Do not drive yourself or let family or fiends drive you to the hospital. Emergency personnel can begin treating you on the way in an ambulance. Chew and swallow one regular full-strength aspirin with water as soon as possible to prevent blood clotting. Once at the hospital make it clear that you are having symptoms of a heart attack. Ask for a complete cardiac evaluation, including an electrocardiogram and a cardiac enzyme blood test. If you are waiting too long, tell them again that you are experiencing heart attack symptoms.

And what's the cash in your retirement account earning these days? Or imagine ... the sanity of buying a home without a lender involved!

Personal story: "I participated in the Special Olympics at Kirkwood when it was held back in February.

Hearing how much fun they had made the entire day one to remember."

Only now, as an omnivorous lover of Champagne, do I have the courage to accept that the RM (a grower who makes his own wine) over NM (negociant) superiority is a bit 1998.

By one estimate, Bruce Springsteen wrote 70 songs for his classic 1978 album, “Darkness on the Edge of Town.” He ended up using 10 that fit together perfectly. They were lean and hungry songs — dark, yes, but ultimately not despairing.

Her life is framed to show she gets more from President Barack Obama than from Republicans. The same contrast could be achieved differently. She could lose her Web design job and go on unemployment, which President Obama always wants to extend despite Republican objections. With her family's income dropping, she could resort to the food-stamp program, which has expanded massively under President Obama despite Republicans inveighing against the trend. These examples don't suit the campaign's purposes, though. They show government to be a poor substitute for the robust recovery that President Obama hasn't delivered even as he has endeavored to make Julia's birth-control pills free.

As each star is introduced, Phillips describes their first meeting with him, often staged as a flashback. Though we're hearing only his side of the story, it's clear that each of these men arrived at his studio as a prodigious but raw talent with working-class roots.

Dear A.O.: Whether they risk getting pelted for wearing pelts remains to be seen, but I think women will, indeed, wear furs come fall. Probably the best bets in fur usage will be as a scarf (ocelot will be worn a lot if designers have their way) or hood (Isaac Mizrahi's fox-trimmed hoods and backpacks look like sure winners).

Don't do it because of this column, don't do it because of the countless lives it has impacted over the years, don't even do it because you loved Outdoor School in sixth grade. Do it because you care about carrying on a tradition that has been part of the Portland community for generations. Do it because it is an integral part of what makes our home great. Do it because we need programs like this to keep our city strong, green and lovably weird.
"We are with students from the time they are admitted to the program all the way through graduation," she said. "We've seen a lot of academic growth, a lot of personal growth, emotional growth, and professional growth."

True to my word, I arrived home in California after a month in Delhi feeling like Santa — my giant duffel bag full of sparkly bangle bracelets and bindis, colorful bags, patchwork quilts, woven shirts, flowing skirts, ethnic shoes, original artwork, funky pillow covers, vibrant tablecloths, handmade stationery and much more.
While much of the shift in poverty is due to demographic changes — Americans are having fewer children than before — the now-weakened economy and limited government safety net for workers are heightening the effect.
It's definitely different. This is the first time I've had a band, a couple friends backing me. MickeyFree is my DJ; he'll play some keyboards, he'll drop beats. Will Ryerson from Other Colors is playing bass, and a little guitar. I’m still playing guitar for significant portion of the set but not all of it. I'll be just singing for some, which is interesting for me. It's freeing and really intimidating.

When Adele sings "don’t underestimate the things I’ll do to you" to the man who broke her heart, she doesn’t sound like she’s willing to stop at name-calling. Kurt Vonnegut always said that vengeance made the best story; here’s a prelude to an epic haunting.

It's not clear whether any of these relatives had to go through the competitive hiring process that an outsider could expect -- or how many of these jobs were publicly posted so others could apply.

I had the opportunity to take in two days of the tour. My first day, Tuesday, was at the Bronx's legendary Paradise Theater. The landmark's ornate baroque architecture provided the perfect backdrop for rap's version of the A-Team's Mr. T.

The setting was intimate, no more than 115 seats tightly arranged around the small stage.

Malbec Reserva "Luján de Cuyo" 2008, Bodegas Nieto Senetiner -- Here's an example of just what an extraordinary deal Argentine malbec can be. Bodegas Nieto Senetiner was founded in 1888 and today owns about 750 acres of vines. These vines are in what is arguably the best district in the vast Mendoza region, an area called Luján de Cuyo. It's where the Mendoza-area wine business began more than a century ago and consequently has the largest number of very old vines.

The heads of the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are going have more prominent jobs in this administration than any of their predecessors since the 1970s, which is why I hope Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doesn't get either job. He's ridden his famous name into a career of mild kookery, including charges that President Bush stole the 2004 (yes, 2004) election and that mercury absolutely, positively causes autism. But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger might be a good choice for either role. He's been a disappointment in many ways, with economic theories that combine the worst of John Maynard Keynes and the most misunderstood of Milton Friedman. But he is a serious environmentalist and the rare politician who could sell consumers on the sacrifices that they'll need to make. Get him away from a state budget and he'd be fine.

CHAMPOEG FOUNDING DAY
We encounter each day the paradox of unfilled jobs existing side by side with unemployed or underemployed people. The challenge is to break down the remaining discriminatory barriers and encourage business, labor and government to provide on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and full upward mobility. We can never reach our full capacity unless we liberate the human spirit and enfranchise all the people of our state  whatever their color, their language, their disability, their age or their sex. To more completely achieve this goal, I will support the necessary changes in our Fair Employment Practices Act, to include prohibitions against discrimination based on sexual preference. The diversity of our people can be a cause of hatred and anxiety or the source of strength and continued advancement. The choice is ours.

Ironically, the effect of Clarence Thomas' alleged misbehavior spotlighted the plight women face on the job. And it became a critical influence in changing American statutory civil rights law.

It's a perennial fight, and the measure usually dies quietly in the Senate. But this year, House Republican leaders are adding pressure by making the spending cap a top priority.

The rectangle-shaped, salt-water tank in Leonardo simulates actual ocean conditions to test everything from chemical treating agents and dispersants to booms and skimmers.

It's the professionalization of everything. I can see some clown coming in to entertain some sick children and being asked if he has a master's in clowning. Does he have peer-reviewed studies? Or is he just, you know, some clown?
DG: Not necessarily. Freese is the starting third baseman now and for 2012, and he gets incumbent status when it comes to filling out the "future" lineup. The mistake people make - and some do it on purpose because these "future" lineups are easy targets for cheap criticism - is to view the lineup as a prediction. It's not. That would be a foolish endeavor. You couldn't hope to be right (see above). I like how one of the editors at Baseball America described it: "Look at it like a depth chart," he said. Freese is atop the depth chart at third base. The "future" lineup is tied to the top 10 and the top 30. So, for example, Carlos Martinez is going to score a spot in the rotation - if it's open - ahead of, say, John Gast, though Gast could be there a year or two ahead of

"Foreign policy highlights many of the president's strengths — this balance of deliberation and decisiveness — and highlights a lot of Romney's weaknesses, of both not being sure quite where he stands and also that it seems he's surrounded by the very people who got us into this mess from the far right," said Tom Perriello, a former Democratic congressman from Virginia who is an analyst for the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.
“It’s just not a theater,” said Michael O’Connell, one of the company’s founding members. He was referring in part to the fact that the space has to do double duty as a business event center.

It would be churlish to direct readers to the video posted on the Internet of Rep. Conyers finding time to peruse a copy of Playboy while on a commuter flight to Detroit. So let's take him at his word that it would be unreasonable to expect a legislator to know what it is he's actually legislating into law. Who does read the thing?

I would like to write about a tragic story that happened in Cleveland. A gifted Karamu actor, Bobby Anderson, was shot and killed in the early '70s. He was appearing in Charles Gordone's "No Place to Be Somebody," directed by the great Reuben Silver. I was told that allegedly his death was one of the reasons his friend, also a Karamu performer, left town to pursue her dreams. That young lady happened to be Debra Byrd, vocal coach for "American Idol." I would cast Jeff Grover and Anne McEvoy as young Bobby and Debra, and Peter Lawson Jones as Bobby's father.

You are respectfully invited to step aboard a giant orange and hover above a mostly idle military base in Irvine. Now, stop snickering and suspend … yourself. It's true that the Great Park — the gradual conversion of the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro into a 1,347-acre public playground in the middle of the O.C. — will be years in coming. But the Great Park Balloon is here now, a helium-filled ball with a people-carrying basket dangling beneath, and it's free. Permanently tethered and big enough to hold 25 people at a time, it flies four days a week, rising 400 feet so you can see 40 miles on a clear day. Hours are 10 a.m.-3 p.m. and 7-10 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, 9 a.m.-3 p.m. and 7-10 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, wind and weather permitting. The ride (which began in 2007) typically lasts eight to 10 minutes, but that's plenty of time to eye the hills and orderly subdivisions, assess the park's recently planted strawberry fields and read the fine print: Someone stenciled a list of major historical events on the old runway surface. Flights are first-come, first-served; kids and pets welcome. There's a free carousel too. Best day to fly: Sunday, when the fledgling Great Park farmers market is in session. If that bout with altitude isn't enough, head about 2 miles southwest to the Irvine Spectrum Center mall, where the amusements include a 108-foot-tall Ferris wheel.

It's why food companies headquartered in the Salinas Valley, the nation's salad bowl, are rushing to find the "perfect wash." They remember too well how, in 2006, local spinach tainted with E. coli O157:H7 killed five people and sent 100 more to the hospital in the worst food poisoning outbreak linked to leafy greens in U.S. history. In and around Salinas, spinach sales still have not recovered from the outbreak, even though no major incident has occurred since.
"It's a piece that I have lived with for almost as long as I can remember. It's one of the first pieces I really fell in love with, as a young kid. I've long been looking for an excuse to do it - and for the resources to do it. So about a year ago I asked some of my colleagues if they'd be interested in collaborating on a production. They all shared my passion for the piece, and it's all fallen into place nicely."

In a quarter-century since migrating from the South, I've found it easy to embrace Minnesota's treasures: the lakes and the tasty walleye lurking in them; the towering male icons (Paul Bunyan and Garrison Keillor) and their wholesome female counterparts (Betty Crocker and Mary Richards); the State Fair and the way we chant "ooooh" in the "Minnesota Rouser."

"As a former real estate developer, I do not see TMT walking away from a significant investment that has been made to date," Owendoff said. "Construction costs have dropped approximately 15 percent over the past six months, and are at or near the bottom.

Preconceived notions like the ones I brought to class are part of the reason. Not wanting to broadcast that you have a handgun in your house or nestled in a holster around your ankle is another.

"Walking gets neighbors out of their houses talking to each other," Reddy said. "When you get real people together talking about how they live, it can lead to discussions about policies and how to improve things. It's good exercise.

If nothing else, it's a chance for neighbors to get to know each other, and for people who don't know a community, it's a chance to get to know it by walking with the people who live there."

I will not go back until they get rid of the Steelers stuff. I will spend my money at Marc's and Buehler's."
