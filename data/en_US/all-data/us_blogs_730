If I had to declare a side (and let’s face it if you’re reading this and you haven’t already worked it out you are probably now wondering so I may as well tell you) I would say I am a Raw Meaty Bones feeder. I have Tom Lonsdale’s (the vet behind the raw meaty bones diet) books and am a member of the raw meaty bones yahoo group. I therefore know more about this way of feeding and my links are to these references as I feel having used them that I can recommend them.
The radiation in those potato chips isn’t going to kill me. Likewise, no one is going to die from Fukushima radiation. Cancer rates are not going to increase in Japan. The disaster wasn’t hidden like the Soviets did, so that people unknowingly ate iodine-131 for two months before it decayed away to nothing. No one threw workers into the fire like lemmings because they didn’t know what to do.

Writing is my favorite way of passing time. And because I’m bilingual, I write my tales in two languages: German and English. So far, my short stories were mostly written in English, for a simple reason. People actually get paid for short stories in the English-language regions, whereas the proof copy is considered enough payment for most publishers in the German-language industry. On the other hand, all my novels have been written in German (I used to have a German agent, with exclusive novel rights …) However, this will change, as my English-language friends are clamoring to read my novels.

Ryback isn’t ready for PPV really, but he had a job tonight in cleansing the palette between the MOTY candidate World Heavyweight Championship match and the Jericho-Punk match which would be looking to follow it. The heel jobbers – which I still don’t really understand other than Ryback can’t get over as a face without them I suppose – were actually quite good heels here with their repetitive ’2 is bigger than 1′ routine. The crowd wanted to see them get beaten, and Ryback did that job well. Beating two jobbers rather than one is more impressive than his victories so far, but the people he’s beating are still essentially jabronis and his victories aren’t that impressive. Now he’s got this out of my way, I support – again – my own idea, to have him face Kane and see if he can get over as a babyface.

The most disturbing title of the record has to be the last track, "My Heart Belongs To Daddy." Not exactly the kind of thing I would think that you would want connected to stripping in my opinion. I would think daddy and daughter are a couple words and images you would want to keep far away from the strip show or the boudoir. Might not set the most romantic mood. Take the title away and the song is just a fun stripper track.
My only regret is that I failed to sample the Mirror Mirror – admittedly because I have a prejudice against barleywine style beers.

I had to take a picture of this because Beck looks huge! And it feels like yesterday when he could fit his whole body on my chest. I always wanted to point out how different my children are. This is an example of Becks easy going-ness(?) He can fall asleep anywhere and be content. He can also sleep through almost anything. Riley on the other hand, once she was about 5 months old refused to sleep anywhere other than her crib for the most part. Sure she fell asleep in the carseat but would always wake up when I brought her in. There was even a period of time where I couldn't shower while she napped because she'd wake up. She is a lot more picky and particular with things, while Beck just goes with the flow. I like how different my children are. Riley is more independent and can fall asleep on her own no problem. Beck is clingy and hates being alone, so I had to start training him to fall asleep on his own really early on. I wish that Riley would fall asleep on me, but I am grateful that she likes to wrap her arms around my neck while she sleeps. Such a big improvement from when she was a baby:) I'm also happy that my son appreciates me enough to cuddle up to me all the time.

As I think I’ve observed here before, finishing a first draft is a funny old business. There’s elation, yes. Relief too. Exhaustion. A strong desire to drink red wine in large quantities. All sorts of other urges I should perhaps keep to myself.

So why do I stand and point my accusing finger at Leviathan? Perhaps those dissidents with a sufficiently high profile will earn some measure of Sakharov's Immunity, at least for a while. Certainly keeping a low profile is no guarantee of protection from being railroaded and destroyed, as the gut-wrenching case of Rick and Terri Reese clearly demonstrates. Needless to say, the elite media has no interest in covering their physical and economic crucifixion by the federal government. Read about their case; it will make you sick to your stomach that this kind of official abuse can happen in the United States of America.

People choose to be in relationships for various reasons. I don’t know how many people ask themselves these questions before deciding to commit to someone. Granted someone people are the dating type, others are the relationship type. I am an advocate for dating. I can get to know you without committing to you. High school confuses this. Boy likes girl, girl likes boy, they go together. In the adult world, not so much. Chances are you aren’t spending 8 hours a day getting to know this person before you become an item. You probably don’t see them at lunch. In your adult life, you must date, then be courted.. there’s a difference.. in my book anyway.

This is a massive moment for me, and it is a long time coming. Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi were really the only composers I countenanced as a young girl. Gradually, and as I played their works, I grew to appreciate the Romantic Beethoven, the Spirited Mendelssohn and the Lyric Schubert. I got to college admitting music up to Chopin but utterly excluding Liszt. To wrap up this whirlwind journey of musical and self discovery, Shostakovich (Sym. #5) and Debussy (Violin Sonata) swept me off my feet and opened the door to all the rest of it.

After 20 minutes we headed up to the boardwalk to get an even closer look and follow hundreds of penguins returning home from a day out fishing. On the boardwalk you can see them within touching distance (but don’t touch they bite), as they parade past you, searching for their sand dune burrows, stopping only to preen themselves before returning home. It’s a noisy affair with mothers and chicks calling out to each other and quarrelling neighbours. I saw a mother feed her baby chick and it was absolutely adorable.
Further down the road, my future lay in the form of more of the same, fresh but familiar hell, a comforting sight, that of motorised nerves, of a learner driver, lurching from the left jerking into the traffic, grateful for a long gap in which to execute such a tricky manoeuvre. The tractor pulled in to a bus stop and wearily waved us past and I pulled up behind the learner.

There used to be a morning radio segment on one of the Houston stations called "Cool Feelings". Those of you who are from H-town might be familiar with it.

You get the idea.

When it comes to the plot, it suffers from all the problems of sequels—it’s too sprawling, there’s too many characters, too many locations, and too much history shoe-horned into the story. The open world gets in the way of the narrative by making it more disjointed than the tightly constructed plot of the original, which, while containing a pretty big cast of characters, was focused squarely on the Joker. In this one, way too many elements are added via dues ex machina that both come out of nowhere, and made less and less sense. The game simply does not set-up many of its plot turns effectively. For instance, when a game that has mostly been grounded in the “real world” (as real as you can make it) suddenly tells me I need to hunt down a several hundred year old man to get a sample of his blood ( someone who hasn’t even been mentioned in the story until now) eyebrows start to raise. I understand his role in the comics ( I’ve have several Batman die-hards explain it to me) but that doesn’t change the fact that throwing this character into the plot out of nowhere, and making a large portion of the story REVOLVE around him is amateurish at best. It screams sloppy fan service, and reinforces the overall feel of things being cobbled together as opposed to being thought-out and interconnected.

It is this author’s opinion that as a prerequisite to effectively confronting the nihilistic dangers of the anti-modernist menace, we may have to first subdue a self-righteous American demon within ourselves. This internal enemy is largely a product of outgroup ascription. It constitutes a national attitude perpetuated by a volatile mix of outsider perceptions and self-righteous American idealism. It generates rage in our enemies and distrust and alienation amongst our potential friends, and likely contributes to U.S. exclusion from important partnerships, like the Sino-Russian agreement noted earlier. In short, our attitude and actions could be titled Imperial America.

The rest of my time in Camden was spent surveying handmade knickknacks and touristy trinkets. If the hollowed-out-camera-lens coffee mugs weren’t a staggering £16.99 I would have bought one. But who knows—maybe I’ll go back and negotiate. Despite leaving empty-handed (though full-stomached), I felt fulfilled; my day at the markets provided more London life than I could’ve asked for. That said, if you’re in the neighborhood, check out London’s markets—there’s much, much more than “bric-a-brac” in these cores of spontaneity and culture.
And yet these rating agencies failed to spot the biggest banking crisis in living memory just three years ago. The US Department of Homeland Security reported last year that “credit rating agencies that investors relied on to provide impartial and accurate analysis of thousands of mortgage-linked securities instead used outdated models and inadequate data, were too influenced by investment bankers, allowed chronic resource shortages to undermine ratings, and delayed downgrading investments once problems in the mortgage market became clear.”

However, Short, like Rauschenberg, makes choices, and there he is, performing painting inside of gluts of information. He is looking for old things like visual punch and beauty. He is not afraid to get involved with the optical effects he finds in the random passages of black and white. Honestly, at the level of surface and image, there is no difference between the passages that Short chooses to paint and the passages that he choose to exclude other than that they are special to him, that they do something for him that the excluded passages don’t. The choice matters. We choose to care about images and that is what makes them meaningful. Our ability to focus, garner our attention towards them, animates them in a way that the market and the glut cannot completely kill. There is a significance to that and outcomes in Short’s paintings, so reminiscent but not quite like works by Christopher Wool or even, brace yourself, the simmering fields of Jules Olitski, carry this significance.

Those of us who write on what is considered the “fringe” of Christian fiction are well-acquainted with the debate that has been raging for the past several years over the genre called speculative fiction. Speculative, for those who aren’t familiar with the term, is the description under which all science fiction and fantasy–and I suppose horror, to a certain degree–is lumped. Basically, if it couldn’t really happen in the present or the past, it’s speculative. If it takes place in the future, it’s speculative. Magic? Advanced technology? Other worlds? Speculative. I think you get the idea.
I found my answer in another web search, where someone had posted a virtual flyer on a site for lost dogs. On it, it noted that ‘MiMI’ – I shuddered every time I had to read that name – had been trained by a world-class dog-trainer and should be able to follow basic commands from anyone. Well, it had certainly been worth the cost. The poor little dog that I had discovered on my doorstep had been no trouble what-so-ever when I had tied a piece of rope into a makeshift lead and let him out into the garden for a wee before I put him to bed. I’d been concerned he might scarper – clean and fed – but he simply trotted into my garden, cocked his leg and then returned to me without ever even pulling the rope taut.

Seeing our distress, some young Chinese came and gave us salt, calmed us down saying 'don't run, just stay here, it will pass'. So we stayed put in midst of tear gas clouds and true enough the minute you put salt on tongue the symptoms subsided quite a bit. Then some Malays who had taken refuge behind parked cars below in a little vacant lot behind Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman called out to us "auntie uncle mari sini mari sini". We staggered over to them. They gave us water and more salt and were so caring. From behind the car we watched people running everywhere with police chasing them. We decided we were staying crouched behind the cars till things cleared. Our companions all eventually left. We were alone in an eerie sort of calm.
The strong IPA that I brewed a month ago turned-out very tasty for what it is...a high-IBU hop monster from Parallel Hell. It dried-out to a gravity of 1.010. I burned through a keg of it this past Saturday at my 100-mile racing buddy Raul Flores' retirement party. It was well-received; Raul likes hoppy beers. (Retiring at the age of 51...sheesh)! I put a warning sticker on it to warn "beer newbies" and fools, since it has a 8.15% alcohol content (by volume).

I would like to offer up a gift of several useful embellishing items to one of you who will leave a comment. I have way too much fun stuff that hubby says is weighting down our house!! The gift pack will include some encyclopedia pages from a 1958 set, pages from an old French book, pages from an old German book, and several surprises. Lots of great things for making note cards and collages.
Fifteen of us in all... and yes, I purposely blurred these shots... since I assume nobody really likes their photo on my blog with photos of them actually eating but I kind of forgot to take pictures... or maybe it was because I was a bit busy in the kitchen???

The reality: other than a few policy statements, delivered enthusiastically but with minimal detail, the politicians never passed legislation that clearly defines the boundaries of Scotland National Park and precludes development in the future.

The president’s comments came just hours before a formal White House dinner to honor Iraq War veterans, some of whom have also served in Afghanistan and may be redeploying there to assist ongoing U.S. military operations. Woodruff was the only journalist invited to attend the dinner.

The ego plays a large part in that, as it is nothing but a protected of you, or so it tells you. It is always looking for a reason to be pissed about something, but to truly live an excellent life, madness must become different.

There is no way that Barnet Council can pretend that Coleman’s parking policies are anything other than an unmitigated disaster. Your own document says so in black and white.
I have been doing extensive image searches on the net for many different designs and patterns for my scapulars, I've been saving the images into a folder for future use. The sort of images I have been looking for is: miraculous medals, IHS, crosses, Lamb of God images, Eucharistic images ~ from this I hope to create many templates, so I can offer those I'm making the scapulars for, a choice of designs.
Tesco doubtless has a grey man in a grey suit, hired primarily due to his uncanny resemblance to Spitting Image's John Major puppet, tasked with establishing risk reduction solutions and due diligence compliance procedures by way of response. Think 25 is his idea. He has three children, called Julian, Sophie and Giles, and lives in Sevenoaks, Kent. He has not had intercourse for five years.
That Evergreen was quite obscene,
I think most people recognize that the right thing to do instead in a situation of that kind is to tell the truth, or as much of it as the children are old enough to grasp, and do it early enough in the season that they can get past the inevitable misery and go to work making the best of things. Talk to people who grew up during the last Great Depression and you’ll hear stories of this kind over and over again—the holiday decorations pieced together from wrappers and scraps, the depressingly plain meal livened up with a few little touches or sheer make-believe, the little doll handmade from rags and burlap sacking that’s still treasured three quarters of a century later, and so on. If love, joy, hope, and authentic inner well-being are to be had in such a difficult situation, they’re going to come that way, not by way of making gaudy promises that are never going to be fulfilled.
That is not saying they are not intelligently written. It is just not something that makes me think about serious topics. I do that every day. I deal with children and husband, and office politics, and risk management, and bills to pay and what to eat for dinner. I don't need to think about how meaningful some topic is, and be pulled into a depressing serious work of literature.

Alexander Hamilton, an orphan immigrant, brilliant economist, and cunning military commander proposed the first federal bank. There was fundamental differences among our forefathers when this happened. Some of them argued that this would set the tone for a central government with too much power and they warned against the danger, after all, they had just spent 4 years trying to figure out a check and balance system to negate a strong central power. This came in recognition and precise analyzing of the political system in England that led up to the tyrannical powers of the King and his court. Why the department of treasury and a central government won out, I believe, comes from the need for money and fear. Fear that what they created would collapse without a central bank backing loans to states and getting loans from other countries by showing collateral or otherwise known as robbing Peter to pay Paul. Jefferson opposed this, Adams would eventually support it.
In order to have a successful team, every member needs to be aware of the common goals and be willing to do whatever it takes to achieve those goals. Relying on one player only limits your success. Since De Rosario is not scoring, this gives other players the opportunity to rise up and believe in their own abilities.

Even when the comments don’t explain why a recipe is the way it is, it becomes clear, as you read through the book, how the techniques and flavor combinations might be applied in different situations and to different foods. For example, I had the ingredients in the house to make chicken enchiladas last night (my husband, who’s the vegetarian one, is out of town – when the cat’s away . . .). Although I didn’t specifically follow a recipe in this book, I used an unfamiliar technique – stacking the tortillas in the casserole between layers of filling, rather than the more labor-intensive stuffing and rolling – and an unfamiliar ingredient Rotel canned tomatoes with chiles – which made the making of my own enchilada sauce very speedy.

Sandra grinned appreciatively, but still wasn’t sure: “A woman wouldn’t leave a letter like that lying around. And what if he asks her about it?”
It’s true I had come far. And each declaration of independence made me even stronger. I ran, I sang my Kelly Clarkson and she encouraged me. But letting go for me is very difficult and most of the time when I say that I’m done and over, it is bravado on my part. I’m doing what I know I must do.
“I wonder how brave you would be if all of your pleasure was gone? It is easy for the fanatic to sacrifice himself in the heat of the movement. I have yet to see the martyr who was on the brink of despair through the end. There is a serious lack of Christians crying, ‘My God, My God, why have you forsaken me.’ Enough! I ask you again, will you denounce Christ?”
And then towards October or November of year eleven, I began to work out what ‘my style’ was. Things suddenly got easier, because I wasn’t comparing my drawings to my friend’s drawings. Her style is completely different to mine. Some prefer it. Others like mine. I liked hers and so was constantly feeling inadequate. Now that I’ve worked out my drawings look different, I’m more accepting of how they look.

During the beginning of this year, my son had fever for several days. The fever would not go away. He also had badly swollen lymph nodes around his neck area. His could not put his head straight and he was in pain. His lips were dry, red and peeling.

Prabhjit Singh, a motivational speaker, said he has been profiled 30 times, starting in Feb. 2007 when he was taking an early morning flight from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport to Alabama.

But after asking for information on the TSA policy, a supervisor told him he could not fly, he said.
Jimmie was born in Tennessee in 1913 and by the age of 16 was already performing locally. He moved to Texas in 1939, joining country singer Roy Acuff's group in 1943 as harmonica and piano man. Jimmie had his first taste of chart success in 1963 when he was featured on Joe Perkins' minor hit Little Eeefin' Annie, but it wasn't until the first episode of Hee Haw aired that he gained national recognition, forming a duo, the Hambone Brothers, with guitarist Jackie Phelps - 'hamboning' for those not in the know, is a rhythmic slapping of the thigh.

This is so important it cannot be stressed enough! Yes, men are totally visual! If you look good, chances are they will be interested in you physically – in other words, they will sleep with you if you let them. This doesn’t mean you are automatic girlfriend material. Most men can and will sleep with a woman whom he finds attractive but wouldn’t want to spend quality time with. The way you create an emotional connection or bond with someone is when they feel comfortable and trust you enough to be their real selves with you – they feel they can tell you anything (and you won’t judge them or berate them). They feel you are really interested in discovering who they are. They feel you have many things in common (people like others who are similar to them in morals, values and beliefs because you reinforce that what they have spent all their lives believing is right. On the other hand people like others who are slightly different enough to offer something new and unique to the table – for example, if a man is weak in one area he may find it admirable and appealing when a woman is strong in that particular area). I strongly suggest you read up more on creating emotional connections with people and if you find any good articles paste the link below!
We realized that the best thing was for Enron to go out of business. The market naturally stripped the fraudsters running Enron of their power. Its failure caused some painful collateral damage to people down the totem pole, but it also taught a generation of people valuable lessons in prudence, investment diversification and ‘if it sounds too good to be true…” And, all this happened without taking the whole economy with it. Markets naturally isolated the disturbance.

Finally, a sort of sphincter opened in the yolk of the creature and it emitted an unearthly gurgle. At this, the robed figures fell silent and they bowed their heads.

Another area of opportunity lies within the retirement market. With more than $400 billion per year rolling out of employer-sponsored retirement plans and into IRAs, plan providers are looking for ways to keep these assets under management. Retirees and pre-retirees who are proactively contacted by their retirement plan provider around the time they leave their employer are twice as likely to keep their retirement plan assets with the plan provider, according to another LIMRA study. Will mobile devices facili-tate this contact? It appears that the plan providers think it might. LIMRA found that about one in three retirement plan providers currently offer mobile access to their sites.
.....Think simple! Newborns look best in their birthday suits (clothes don't tend to fit them yet, anyway!). Gather favorite blankets, especially those with texture! Dress children in solid colors (stripes or other geometrical patterns are fine), but avoid busy prints. Families don't all need to dress the same, but it's good to coordinate. For instance, pick a theme: pastels, shades of blue, red-blue (a great combination!), jeans, khakis, etc. I have two suggestions: look for family photos that you like and try to copy their style. Then lay out a bunch of clothes options on a bed and eye what goes well and what stands out too much.

In the mean time, we got much sweet love from kids in Korea so we had to postpone going abroad for promotion because we have been busy with many things around here.

The gospel writer Mark (and Mel Gibson in The Passion of the Christ) begin when Jesus is an adult.

Down with Tyranny describes it as Lewis "shaming" Broun into withdrawing, and that's the biggest takeaway here: What repugs are doing - not just on gay rights, but on women's rights, on global warming, on the budget, on helping the poor, on saving the middle class, on growing the economy - everything, repugs are shameful.

In one recent example, Acura apologized after a leaked casting-call sheet for its Super Bowl commercial asked for an African-American car dealer to be “nice looking, friendly, not too dark.” A spokesman explained that “the skin tone restriction was to avoid problems with lighting and special effects.” Yet, one wonders, would they turn down stars like, for example, Taye Diggs or Sidney Poitier or Lou Gossett Jr., without even giving them a try-out?

Place the tin foil package at the edge of the fire. Do not place it directly in the flame. The goal is not to burn it to a crisp, but to roast it slowly with the heat from the fire. Remember to turn it every 3 to 5 minutes or so (it shouldn't take longer than 12 to 15 minutes, depending how your open fire is and how thick your piece of meat is). Take it off the heat. Carefully cut foil to open. Serve with lemon wedges.

In Virginia, the only hills I had were those on the Noland Trail. One trip around the loop had a gain of over 2,000 ft. over the 5+ miles. I ran that trail 3 times in a row right before I left, (a total of a mile each of ascent and decent), so I thought I was ready for hills, but it consisted of dozens of small hills instead of long continuous ones, and it was a dirt trail which is way less stressful on your body than asphalt or concrete. In addition, I was exhausted with jetlag and stressed from the move, I added hills to every run while maintaining my mileage and pace, I was running on sidewalks instead of the road most of the time, and running both up and DOWN hills. And, of course, I’m an over 40 woman. By adding hills to every workout and not backing off on mileage or intensity, I totally exceeded the 10% rule!

Hence the Cheese Friday evening I’d carefully planned with my mates, in order to allow P to get to his work Christmas party, rather undesirably became Tears Friday: I wept on P in the morning, then on Tills and Polly in the evening. Much like the occasional necessity to bang on about what I’ve learned, I begrudgingly appreciate that this is just another of those things that must occasionally be done. There are just things that sometimes have to be said, as I so wish there weren't, to the people closest to me; both things I need to get off my chest and ensure are understood, and things that can help those who most need to comprehend the day-to-day realities of mine and P's shituation in order to make themselves most useful, for both for our sakes and theirs. (I don't mean that in an expectant, needy way, I'm just mentioning it because, well, that's just what close family and best mates do.)

The one thing you certainly won’t find in this movie are any teenage heart throb vampires who shimmer in the sunlight. Nothing against the Twilight fans, but that just isn’t my cup of tea. In this particular genre it is getting pretty hard to find an original vampire movie that brings something new, most of what I see today is just more of the same. In fact if you were to take a broad view of the mainstream vampire movies out there just within the last 30 years you could pretty much narrow it down to two different groups. In one group you have the vampire movies that lean more towards the ones like 30 Days of Night that portray them as much more animalistic looking with a ravenous hunger for blood. And then you have the vampire movies like Underworld or Interview With the Vampire where they are depicted as a more humanistic character where they’re either gun wielding or sword swinging warriors, or the more seductive and refined predators but still leaning towards the human side. But again this is just a broad view of the more popular one’s, I am sure there are plenty of vampire movies out there that have certainly brought something new and refreshing. Since Max Schreck brought us one of the first on-screen vampires in the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, the character of the vampire has been exhausted over the decades with someone always trying to bring something that no one has ever seen before. But again with the general overview of vampire movies it’s pretty easy to narrow them down into either of the two groups I mentioned, so in my opinion for someone to bring something completely new and refreshing means exploring new ground in the story surrounding the vampire and not how scary he or she appears on camera. In the case of Let the Right One In (or it’s American version Let Me In) which is based on the same named book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, it is about a young vampire who befriends a boy next door, most of the movie is about their friendship with very little action compared to what we’re used to seeing in a typical Hollywood vampire movie. I haven’t gotten to the book yet but I really can’t wait to pick it up because I know there is so much backstory that wasn’t included in the movie due to time constraints. And in the case of great vampire stories, Park Chan-wook has certainly brought something new to the genre. Though he has completely stepped away from his vengeance trilogy with this film, his signature on this movie is unmistakable.
Yesterday I decided to take a note out of her book and get in to this packed lunch idea. I spend an insane amount of money on lunch as I work in central London, and I am surrounded by so many tasty places to go to, that packing a lunch seems like too much hassle, but then I thought about it. My usual order at Pret (as an example) would be their Ham and Egg Bloomer, Miso Soup, Banana, and if I felt like it, a packet of crisps. You’re looking at a cost of around £6.00. Do that every work day and you’re looking at £30 a week (£120 a month) and that’s not including snacks (I am a Graze Box aficionado!) or the occasional Starbucks run (yes, I am a terrible human being, I know!) and when you’re not exactly earning a fortune – this all seems a bit of a muchness, so maybe Karen is on to something.

There are two ways to look at this issue. The first is the hands-off method. The savings you realize in transportation and food more than offset the increase in your electric bill, right? So you can leave well enough alone and still come out ahead. But for some of us, that’s just not enough. We want to knock down that bill as far as it will go and help save money on a recurring and often unpredictable cost. Thankfully, there are many ways to accomplish this. All it takes is a little work and some savvy.
Frankly, I loved it. It's an amazing movie. However, it certainly won't leave you dripping with the milk of human kindness. I wouldn't recommend having to interact with other people a whole lot for a little while after you've seen it.

Bibbidy Bobbidy Boutique is located inside The Magic Kingdom in Cinderella's Castle. The Fairy God Mothers who help transform every girl to their choice of Pretty Princess, Pop Princess, or Diva Princess, come out to get each girl show them their Princess Make Over choices and then they spend about an hour Making them into a Princess at the end they take a magic wand filled with Pixie Dust and they spin them around in circles saying the statement Cinderella's Fairy Godmother said to her and sprinkling them with Pixie Dust Glitter then they show them what they look like. It was a wonderful experience and the girls loved it. Grandma Paula and I wished they had picked Pretty Princess or Diva Princess like Willow's Pretty Hair Piece but Piper and Harley both picked Rainbow Hair Pop Princess. Willow picked Blond Hair Diva Princess. They also received cool Make Up to take home, fake nails to take home, Jewels for their faces, a gorgeous Bracelet, and lots of cool hair accessories plus their Hair Piece all for about $52 a girl.
the Spice Girls and serenaded Sir L to Jewel's, "You Were Meant For Me." He wasn't impressed. In fact he told me that I go into a "weird zone" when I listen to or sing Madonna. I'm second guessing whether he should come with me to her Paris show on July 14. The night ended with margaritas and dancing late into the night at Silencio. This time we didn't get mugged.
There are various reasons a medium or psychic would refuse or be unable to do a reading for you and yet the first thing everyone always thinks if it happens to them is, ‘Oh, goodness, they’ve seen I’m going to die and so they can’t see anything ahead of me.’ This really isn’t why it is at all and sadly, most of them don’t, or won’t, tell you why they aren’t doing you a reading and this just causes worry and upset for the one who is turned away. Even if they do tell you why, most will go away worried and think the above anyway.
Vegas: You swear you're going to be sober while gambling, see all the new hotels, and get up from the Blackjack table if you lose two hands in a row.

“But as you begin to ask more specific questions, you get lower levels of support for specific programs as people worry about costs, taxes and the rise of government,” Kohut added. “Plus, there is a great deal of political polarization of this.”
I’ve also been judged for having a young mom. My mother was pregnant with my brother at the age of 15. Now, your first thought at that would probably be, “God, her momma’s a slut!” But you know, my gramma never said a word to my mother about sex. Yes, thats that big scary S word that little kids tell on you for saying. Sex. She was young, uninformed of the outcomes, and for all she knew, it was nothing but having a little bit of fun. How was she supposed to know? And wether or not my mom really was a ‘slut’ she has 3 kids, and as far as I’m concerned, she is the most amazing mother a kid could ever have.

But I have been mulling it over. And came up with my own provocative blog-post title. This blog is primarily about our homeschooling adventures, but the reason we homeschool is primarily giftedness. I'm saying it loud and I'm saying it proud. At the top of the blog, I have a static page about giftedness (although it is hidden a bit in my cryptic song title lyrics). My last post could not describe my children without saying "they are exceptionally gifted." It is who they are. It helps define them and certainly explains a heck of a lot of sh*t! And it isn't meant to be "bragging".

The most powerful element in the calculations is the “popularity” of web pages and images with other web users; the more people link to a web page, the higher it will be in search results.

Yes, commodity bubbles happen, but eventually reality sets in and brings the price back down to reality. You don’t get 3, 4, and 5 standard deviation events. A four standard deviation price rise falls outside 99.994% of all outcomes, one in 100,000 years; a five standard deviation price rise is about one in 2 million years. That pretty much covers the time since our ancestors beat things with big sticks.

This wonderful Huffington Post essay by Holly Robinson describes her 6th grade son’s misery in school. It sounds so much like my fifth grade son’s misery, it made me realize that maybe his “school = lethal injection minus the yummy last meal” attitude just may be generic. Having been a girl all my life, I didn’t realize boys could be so out of synch with the whole classroom thing. I thought everyone aspired to to Teacher’s Pet-for-Life.
Medical staff who provide antenatal care are often insufficiently trained in the skills of communication. Pregnant women are very vulnerable and sensitive. The last thing a pregnant woman needs is increased anxiety, which creates tension. This is bad both for her and for her baby.

I marvelled at those fingers, the way they curled around mine like little worms.
In a way, it was entirely appropriate that a titan such as Louis Armstrong would be the artist to end the reign of the first foreign group ever to take over the American pop scene. It can be argued, after all, that Armstrong bears more responsibility for shaping the course of 20th-century American music than Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra combined. Louis Armstrong became one of jazz music’s first individual superstars as a young trumpet player in the 1920s and 30s, but more than that, he revolutionized jazz itself by turning it into an individual improvisational art form. The recordings Armstrong made with his Hot Five and Hot Seven combos between 1925 and 1927 are widely credited with creating much of the foundation for the future of jazz and blues performance and, by extension, of rock and roll. Armstrong’s own statement that “if it hadn’t been for jazz, there wouldn’t be no rock and roll,” was effectively endorsed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted Armstrong as an “early influencer” in 1990.
The poem more or less speaks for itself – the octave describes the problem of being a horny middle class fantasist without your lover being there, and the sestet recommends wanking, because even if she was there she wouldn’t want to get into bondage anyway. In the era of E.L. James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, this seems humorously fitting. In the final version, I changed the final line to fit the metre better, and to add a caesura:
Here's a nice side on shot of the handpumps (I'm still talking beer).
On a closer level, people also need others around them for stimulation, for reflection and for feedback on how they are doing in the world they live in. We all need a certain form of validation, people like to share things and encourage each other so as to bring out the best in ourselves. If we shut ourselves up completely, we condemn ourselves to be confined to the small world of our own pretentiousness, and limit our abilities to our own familiar mindsets.

I was thinking about all those people in that great city. I was thinking about all those squares and cubes and and geometry and the symmetry of the city. I was thinking about a river flowing through the city. I was thinking about God and whether or not he was King of that city too. I was thinking about that building right near the center that looks like the top of a castle (in the picture). It’s made entirely of glass and does it ever shine in the light. It’s called the Pittsburgh Plate Glass building. I was thinking about the city sparkling in the sunlight and glittering in the moonlight. It’s a veritable city on a hill whose light cannot be hidden.

He carried the heat on his back and kept them in the game, giving them the lead several times in the final minutes.

I registered for the Michelle Bridges 12wbt a few weeks ago now. We are into Week 3 of the warm up season. Pre-season starts in just over a week.

I know it’s for my own health that I’ve decided to do this. It’s so I can start reaching my goals. So why do I still find it so hard to start?
And therein lies the power of the MSM. It is not through direct bias — there is no conspiracy, no reporter changing facts due to a heart full of malice — but through a frame that positions a certain kind of reader as legitimate and natural.
You can either be a psychological adult or a psychological child. A psychological adult is like a painter. The brush is in his hand and he has the choice of strokes. He creates what he chooses to create. A painter is a choice maker. A psychological child is like a painting. It is a consequence of the painter`s choices. It has no say in what it is becoming. A painting is a mere consequence receiver. Mona Lisa may be the world`s finest piece of art. Yet, it is only a consequence of Leonardo da Vinci`s choices. Millions of Mona Lisas can be duplicated; will there ever be another Leonardo da Vinci?

I am reading from my copy ... really slowly ... and he is following the words in his copy with his finger. No pressure on him to have to read. He can just follow and enjoy the experience. The lovely thing about this is that he wants to read it. He is coming to me asking if we can please read Mr Fox. Absolutely we can ...

There are works that are right at the watercolour end.

To know me is to know that I hate Xmas season. I hate buying mass quantities of gifts that people really don't need. I don't like the decorations. I don't like how folks all of the sudden expect me to stop being my naturally snarky self and somehow start blowing reindeers and candy canes out of my ass, just cause it's December. I despise the debate between saying Happy Holidays/Merry Xmas. Who gives a shit? Say what you want, celebrate however you wish. It doesn't offend me. Just don't expect me to go to church and go back to leaving me alone.

I love scones, and I have been searching for a good recipe for a while now. Every one I've tried seemed to have flopped and I've ended up with either dry and dense scones, or muffin and cake-like ones. Well I am happy to report that I have finally found the perfect scone recipe and I am THRILLED to share it with you!!! These scones are perfect! They are golden and crispy on the outside and perfectly moist and soft on the inside. The original recipe adds a sweet lemon glaze, which sounds delicious, but since I'd like to give them away, I wanted to include the lemon flavor right into the scone. So I added more sugar to the recipe and added lemon swirled right into the dough. They were sooo good, so thank you, thank you, thank you, Jaden from Steamy Kitchen for sharing these! They are great for a special breakfast or brunch, or they make a beautiful gift. I enjoyed mine fresh from the oven with a warm cup of Teavana's Earl Grey Creme tea.

The London in which Dickens lived, thrived, and — especially as a child and a young man — suffered was in his day the greatest and most populous metropolis the world had ever seen. The journalist Henry Mayhew, a contemporary of Dickens, wrote, “In every thousand of the aggregate composing the immense human family, two at least are Londoners.” The many new implications of what it meant to belong to, and take sustenance from, a human family of this enormous size, with its variety, instability, grotesquerie, anonymity, interconnection, anarchy, and forms of community and exchange were explored intimately by Dickens in his novels and his journalism.

The terror as depicted in Lovecraft’s stories, is something we are not aware of but have some foreboding. Worse is the hindsight we get from the disturbing Lovecraftian tales. It isn’t the thing to which we are exposed to that let us react attracted but repelled at the same time.In movies often shocking pictures are used to evoke a direct physical response from the audience (e.g. Saw). The more interesting thing here is the deviant pleasure we create by using the attention span and growing a little paranoia. And in my opinion this is why people prefer deep immersion in role-playing games and bleed when they have first experienced it. How do you enter those states?

Elsewhere Derek Quinlan was there from the start of proceedings today, together with his good wife Siobhan. He sat impassively throughout as the cross-examination took place and although his bull-headed frame was looking over in the direction of Paddy, seated some 30 feet, there were no dagger glares, as he calmly took in what was being said. He left the room nearly every hour for a few minutes – there is no mobile phone reception allowed in the court-room as it interferes with the sound system. A confidentiality order covering payments made by the Barclays to the Quinlans has been continued, and will continue until lifted.

After finishing the roof it was time to anchor the building. We did the final squaring and got ready to install the anchors. Uh. We might have a problem here. Take a look at the 2 anchors at the bottom of the picture. The one on the right is what was supplied in the anchor kit I bought, paying perfectly good money for it. It's 1/4 inch and was woefully inadequate. To fix it I went to the hardware store (Oh Joy!) and bought fifty 1/2 inch by 3 inch anchors. You can see the difference here. You do not anchor a 14x31x10 foot building with tinker toys.

When the vaShawasha heard that they sent two men to Chief Mangwende saying. “Let us kill all the white men in this country.” They sent two men to Chief Makoni. Some were sent to Wedza to Chief Svosve, some to Mashayamombe, Nyandoro, and to all chiefs of the vaZezuru. All the chiefs and their people agreed, because the white men had brought many troubles to this country. All of them must be killed. That was the beginning of the war in Mashonaland. The leaders of the vaShawasha who led the people to kill the white men are: Mashonganyika, Gutu, Madamombo, Gondo, Guhwa, Nyava, Chikowore, Makumbe. They killed some traders and some European farmer. near Melfort.

You wouldn’t imagine this happening in Riyadh. So much for extremist Salafi Saudi zealots controlling Saudi Arabia! This weekend, someone held a party at our compound. Our family had gone for eating out and groceries and on our way back into our compound, we noticed that there were a lot of cars parked at the entrance gate of our compound. We were a little curious about what was happening and we were told by the guard that villa # xy was hosting a party. There were some teenagers standing at the gate trying to get in.
Hickey was troubled because all these people were getting money from the government, and no one was worried. The government likes art today, but tomorrow it might not. And of course Robert Mapplethorpe came along and ruined everything. This of course, is another Hickey over simplification. But the point to make is this: It was bound to happen. All the institutions and all being funded by the NEA were essentially working for the government and they all got fired. Its like working for Ford and getting laid off, except you can’t go to the government for welfare because they just fired you.

Later, when Banderas was reading the “Bear Alert” about a New Hampshire black bear “house thief” as field bear footage ran, prankster producers inserted a censored Trampoline Bear clip into the video. (The bowdlerized footage showed only the Trampoline Bear falling onto the trampoline and bouncing high into the air: the bear’s crashing into the earth was appropriately excised.) When the Trampoline bear clip aired, Banderas exclaimed, “You guys!” as the floor crew erupted in laughter. When Banderas finished her report, she shook her head and remarked, “Hm. Tried to get that one past me. Not my fault!”

I grew up in Austin, one of the most notorious crucibles of cool in the USA. By fifteen, I was acting world-weary because I was listening to Roxy Music. By nineteen, I had discovered punk rock and new wave in Austin clubs. In local record stores, I mined progressively lesser known music, and the cults surrounding bands like Big Star. I learned you have to do some work to find the best music and art. None of this is true today. If anything interesting happens in a music club anywhere in the world tonight, it will be on YouTube tomorrow. MP3 blogs, file-sharing sites like Demonoid, Facebook and MySpace--these are only the best-known ways in which people find out about the latest, coolest thing.

Nothing is impossible — we just have to keep trying!

The 798 Art District is no longer cutting-edge, but still, it’s a glimpse into Beijing’s world-class art scene. I saw both documentary frankness and irony; a multi-pronged social critique. One show depicted a warehouse full of headshots of a sex worker, taken every few minutes all day. There are tons of Mao quotations for sale (on posters, shirts, bags, mousepads). I’m told this is nostalgia (hard for outsiders to understand) along with the irony we get immediately.

I first heard him speak in 2000, when he was invited along to one of my colleague Jenny Lawn's classes to talk about Freud. He hadn't been in New Zealand very long, and of course that was how most of us still knew him: as the author of The Assault on Truth: Freud’s Suppression of the Seduction Theory (1984), and as the subject of Janet Malcolm's In the Freud Archives (1984), which he took her to court over.

Bible study was often the subject of oratory at Christian Endeavor Conventions. Speaking on some Christian Endeavor Principles, Rev. Russell H. Conwell—a favorite convention speaker—said: “I believe that a pledge is a good thing. . . . Hence I believe in the Christian Endeavor pledge to speak every week in the meeting; it makes men. I believe in the advice of studying the Holy Bible for itself; it makes men” (Clark, Christian Endeavor, supra, p. 606). Said to be the greatest preacher in England of his time, the Rev. Dr. J. H. Jowett said at the British National Convention in Glasgow: “Let your endeavor grow out of the great and studious contemplation of the great mysteries in Christ;” and Jowett was speaking on “Christian Endeavor and Bible-Study” (Clark, Christian Endeavor, supra, pp. 608-609).

The Inca’s were the largest civilization in South America, their territory spanning 4000 miles along the Pacific coast of South America starting in Columbia and finishing close to what is now Santiago, Chile. What is amazing about this tribe is how much they accomplished in such a short amount of time. The civilization began in the 1300′s however their peak lasted less than 100 years from 1435 to 1531 AD. The first Incas were formed in Lake Titicaca on Isla del Sol (which I briefly wrote about in the last blog). Legend has it that the Incas began with Mama Ocllo (a woman) and Manco Capac (the first king of the Incas) rising up from Lake Titicaca with a golden spear. With their spear they travelled north to find the best land to call home. When they arrived in Cusco, they stuck their spear in the ground and named it the capital of the Incas. Mama Oclla taught the native women about sewing and weaving, while Manco Capac taught the men how to cultivate the land and build infrastructure and houses. They also formed the language Quechua, which is still spoken today in Peru and Bolivia.

The supporting characters being Amy Robsart Dudley (who died from a questionable fall down the stairs) and William Cecil make the story less bawdy. Portraying Elizabeth as acting a lovesick teenager is not exactly the image I wish to explore of the monarch, but I am glad to finally cross this one off of my tbr list. Of Gregory’s novels, I disliked The Other Queen which featured Elizabeth I as well, so perhaps I should stay away from those stories that embellish and try to tarnish the virginal image that I admire of Elizabeth. I did enjoy Gregory’s last two novels in The Cousins’ war series, and The Queen’s Fool was very well done as well, so I am not one of those readers who despises the author.

The Premium pack adds on full interior and cover customisation, (for $2999, I’d expect it and more!), author alterations, paper galleys, indexing, full industry registration, including Library of Congress and US copyright. Many of these services are available for 50-100 bucks with other POD publishers and are included in far more basic packs. Finally we get something really worth it, copyediting! Also a CD archive (I’m not sure what the benefit of this is, Xlibris could simply give you ownership of all the book files instead), a press release and opt-in email campaign and pro book review campaign.

Funny I should stumble across all this today when I had a job interview. Although you can't always trust old Wikipedia as a source I took a little solace in the story of Earheart having to truss up her leather jacket to avoid looking like an inexperienced rookie and gain acceptance by the boys. Eighty years on and nothing much has changed really. Working women have to make careful choices about what we wear to send a message about our abilities as much as a reflection of our personal style. Today I donned a suit and left my femininity at the door to try to make a good first impression in my interview with a company in a very male dominated industry.
In those old days, they mainly ate vegetables but sometimes they could get pork. When visitors came over they would hang up thier bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man could 'bring home the bacon'. They would cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and 'chew the fat'.
I woke up early the next day. I planned to leave the hotel at 7:00 am to go to Borobudur first. Borobudur is 70 kilometers away from downtown Yogyakarta. It would take more than an hour to get there so I had to leave early. What’s good about the hotel room I got is that it comes with free breakfast, and I am not ashamed to say I paid 35 USD a night for it. I had a room to myself, the AC was good and I had a clean toilet, shower, and most importantly sheets. No bedbugs.
2) Travel freedom. Did you know that a US or Canadian passport isn’t particularly useful to travel to South America? US and Canadian citizens have to obtain a visa, in advance, just to travel to Paraguay! Or Brazil. Plus Argentina and Chile both charge ‘reciprocity fees’ on arrival (since the US and Canadian governments do the same thing.)

The Geej has started her karate class at school, and she's digging it. It's cool because most of the kiddos in the class are new to her (as opposed to her already knowing everyone in her gymnastics class). I think her favorite part of karate may be getting to wear her "karate unicorn." She's also going through a "baseball" phase where she's wanting for me to throw the wiffle ball for her to swat at with her big red bat every night. Since she's not related to me by blood, she may actually have a shot at having some athletic skills!

The musical and teaching talents of Johann were limited. Soon Ludwig learned music, notably the organ and composition by renowned musicians, such as Gottlob Neefe. Neefe recognized how extraordinarily talented Beethoven was and not only did Neefe teach him music, but he made the works of philosophers, ancient and modern, known to Beethoven as well.

Yes let’s get into the gutter to fight Marxism and the Regime. Again, state the facts for the incoherent Liberals. Sandra Fluke wants to have loads of sex, obviously many one night stands or in her case, one hour stands, and we pay for the sex? She is going to Georgetown yet somehow the words of the Constitution escape Fluke. I never saw the writing in the Constitution that says we pay for cheap Hookers to do what they do.

So, I'm pretty sure what I said above isn't gonna ruffle too many feathers. What I'm about to say might, and I'm sorry. But here's the thing, and I'm not quite sure how to say "the thing" in the first place, so bear with me. The comparison to interracial marriage and the calling people who would or did vote in favor of proposition 8 "h8trs" makes me really uncomfortable. For me this has nothing to do with "hating" anyone or thinking anyone is less than anyone else because they're gay or black or atheist or whatever else. We're all people, remember?

In the conception of many, the diversity tower starts with white women on the bottom floor and works its way to the top story where blacks reside. When it comes to special benefits conferred, this conception is pretty accurate. Yet when blacks and gays tussle, gays often win (figuratively speaking, of course--as these crime stats show, they don't actually get the better of a physical confrontation).

I might have lost heaven, but I won´t give up on valleys! I´m thinking I can probably manage an ocean given enough time. Oh, that and water -- I also need to find water. Woodlice sometimes come to help me. Gigantic ones that scared me initially, but do you know, they´re the friendliest creatures I´ve ever come across; so gentle and interested. ”Why hole?” one of them said and when I explained they just started to dig =) Sixten, the one whose carapace has a certain shimmer to it, comes everyday and stays when the others have left. I think he´s into me. Will I invite Sixten to share some fermented potato soda in my tent tonight? I think so.

Nothing that is done for you is a matter of course. Everything originates in a will for the good, which is directed at you. Train yourself never to put off the word or action for the expression of gratitude.

“MONARCH programming was a government funded mind control experiment included under the larger CIA operation MK ULTRA. Operation Monarch involved using severe electro-shock trauma, sexual abuse, and other sadistic methods designed to split the subject’s mind into alternate personalities. The methods were conducted primarily on children because they are easier to break down psychologically, due to their primitive stage of emotional and cognitive development.”[73]
I loved our Home Bible Studies. Mom and Dad made a game of scripture recollection. Dad would ask, "What were the names of the 3 men burned alive in the furnace?" My siblings and I would excitedly call out "Shadrach!" "Abednigo!" "Meshach!" Dad was especially thrilled that we remembered the 4th figure in the flames. Best of all in these home studies was that they were completely positive. We didn't hear any lessons about what the "place of a woman should be" or that "when we got older and got a husband it was God's Will that we obey and submit to our husbands". Dad always told us that we could be and do anything that we wanted when we grew up.

And it's not just only about food, i am enjoying the interaction between me and all of you here. I know i sometimes never replied to each and every one of your comments, be assured that i'm reading it and appreciate all of them. Also even though sometimes i think that my food is not that really nice or appealing but all of you are always so sweet and nice with your words, i really thank you.

Here is the connection for each of us; God might call us to do some pretty crazy things – things that do not make sense in worldly wisdom – but we need to follow through and be obedient to what God is asking because His ways are always right. God has a plan for you and you must trust and obey him to see them come to life – even when those things seem crazy to everyone else. I am reminded of this: Jeremiah 29:11 - For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

No one would argue that a shot like that was anyway near what we would want to do in street photography, but it stresses what pose is and what it can bring in terms of connotations. Pose is the direct or indirect arrangement of a scene to be photographed. Like setting up President Kennedy in the shot mentioned. Like setting up anything else under any circumstance you can think of. Pose is a broad and very important thing in any type of photography.

He was disarmingly correct. We had been flirting with each other for the best part of a year and in my mind it was pretty much inevitable that we would eventually sleep with each other and perhaps go on to form a more serious relationship. Well, the sex part had finally happened but, as he had just said, it had been a bit of an anti-climax. It had been easy, relaxed and comfortable and yes, I had had an orgasm, but it hadn’t been an earth shattering one. And that was a shame because I was indeed hoping for and even expecting more from our first time together. I said nothing but the expression in my eyes told him all he needed to know.

Jones adopts the image of the femme fatale by recreating the film’s theatrical poster on the album’s jewelcase. Although her starlet features suggest girlish innocence, Jones’ pursed lips and gritted teeth reveal her sinister intentions.

A while after I joined up with the local writers, George Martin and Melinda Snodgrass were looking for new writers to join the Wild Cards consortium, in preparation for a relaunch of the series. Melinda and Daniel Abraham convinced George to take a chance on me.
A while ago I learned of "Mercury in Retrograde". What an interesting time this is. If you've had trouble getting something off the ground recently this could be why. Try again in a week or more and you should have more luck. This explains A LOT of moodiness for me.

Somewhere in there, a call had come in for police to attend the ward of a general hospital to support mental health professionals who had ‘sectioned’ a man and who now needed to be transferred to a mental health unit very nearby. (I later calculated you could walk ‘door to door’ in approximately 7 minutes.) The reason for the request for police officers was that upon being told he was to be transferred, the man had said “No, I’m not going there. You’re not sectioning me.” When I eventually got involved in this incident and asked various questions, I failed to establish what had been done, considered or tried, between “No” and the call to the police. I need to be extra-clear here: the man was not violent, was not threatening violence and if there were any resistance or violence in his previous contact with mental health services, none of this was being disclosed to the police.
And then no book about an airport could be complete without mentioning the shops and goodness knows, Heathrow's Terminal 5 has an abundance of them...infact, many people initially complained that Term 5 was more like a mall than an airport. De Botton muses that those people that objected to too many shops had probably considered that in the event of a catastrophe, they wouldn't have liked to have spent their last few moments on earth indulging in a vice like consumerism! :)

To speak personally, this old acquaintance and longtime admirer of Cheever’s had to battle, while reading these Journals, with the impulse to close his eyes…. His confessions posthumously administer a Christian lesson in the dark gulf between outward appearance and inward condition; they present, with an almost unbearable fullness, a post-Adamic man, an unreconciled bundle of cravings and complaints, whose consolations — the glory of the sky, the company of his young sons — have the ring of hollow cheer in the vastness of his dissatisfaction.
The above is a great way of propping pinwheels in a table centerpiece. Just take a ball jar, fill with coffee beans and voila the pinwheel sticks will stay perfectly upright. For a bit more fun just tie a bit of ribbon around the jars.
But something dawned on me though. Somehow, my story in all of it's mess and disgusting, dark places that I often wish weren't a part of who I am, had impact just because I was willing to share it. My freedom invited her to break the silence so she too could experience what I have as God's light has been shed on my past.

I got myself an Alienware Aurora. I didn't realize until recently that Alienware was purchased by Dell, and the prices are actually reasonable. So I ordered myself a $1700 computer. At checkout, I noticed all of my shipping options had zero cost, even next day, so of course I opted for next day (after assembly).
I was wondering the other day why you rarely see Bulgarian wines on the supermarket shelf. When I first started drinking wine back in the '80s they were a real bargain - a cut-price alternative to claret. Then they obviously panicked about being thought old-fashioned and went through a new world-ish makeover with higher alcohol, lots of ultra-ripe fruit and bright jazzy labels but obviously people felt if they were going to buy a new world-style wine they would rather it actually came from South Africa or elsewhere in the southern hemisphere.

So basically the surgeon wants me to go for an Upper GI to see if my pouch is dilated. He seems to think I've been eating so much (not the case if he'd listen to me) that my pouch has expanded. He didn't over any fill being removed or anything. Oh and I need to do two weeks of food journals to see the amount of calories I'm taking in, he insinuated that I could be consuming as much as 5,000 calories a day.

Sheesh, Patrick Demsey brings one rabid monkey into the country and ruins it for everyone! Okay then, scratch the pet monkey. Instead, I'll just make it my resolution to start addressing everyone I meet as Colonel. But I won't pronounce it like "kernel". I'll say it just the way it looks - "colonel".

He nearly ran into the dumpster that was set up against a fence. Gingerly, he hoisted himself up onto the dumpster and over the wood plank barrier. He had no idea where he was going; all that mattered was putting as much distance between himself and the nightmarish sounds coming from the store. Beyond the fence was what looked like a large gravel lot, gleaming white in the moonlight. With control and effort he could barely muster, he lowered himself to the ground on the other side of the fence.

So….I started this blog to give Daddy a window into what the kiddos were getting into over here while he’s deployed. Alas, Daddy’s deployment leaves me no time to blog due the previously aforementioned kiddos. Its what we call a closed loop. And, the closer Sean’s arrival (and thus our impending move to Hawaii) gets, the more spaced out the posts seem to get. Argh! Frustrated!
When I'm on vacation and I'm not working, I ususally have some amazing ideas for new products. I don't try, but it just happens. Well, I found that the same thing happened when I was sick. So now I am madly jotting down every idea that comes into my head. When the illness clears, we'll see if any of these ideas stick or if they were simply the product of a mind on too much cough syrup! :)
E and I were having a discussion. He said something he believed to be true about me. I felt defensive and I told him there was no point in arguing with him. He had obviously made up his mind about what to believe. He said that that actually proved his point about what he thought to be true. But he wouldn't let it go. He told me to make him understand. Close to tears I tried again. He listened with an open mind. He told me that he must have drawn the wrong conclusion and then he told me in essence:
The group was well trained and was split into a number of squads of about 20 mercenaries each distributed throughout the upper deck, the IDF said. All of the mercenaries wore gas masks and ceramic bulletproof vests and were armed with either bats, slingshots, metal bars, knives or stun grenades.

I tried to tell them. But they talked fast. Eventually the teacher stepped in and class began. I heard them whisper behind me, as I sat in the front row. Then finally when the teacher turned, the boy behind me told me he had saw my file earlier in the teacher's office and knew that I was not a "Han" like the rest of them.

You see, I think most giveaways out there are downright depressing. They offer a massive, amazing prize, allow ANYONE to win, as long as they follow the blog, comment, whatever, during the contest period, and so the odds that little old me will win diminish to the point of impossible.
So, do I see myself as a mother someday? One way or another – either through the good old fashioned way, artificial insemmination or adoption, the answer is yes. Still I stand by my original philosophy that nothing will happen until it is time to happen. And for those of you whose time has come, congratulations. Know that whatever you do, however you do it, even if you choose to give your blessing away to people who you know are better equipped to care for them, it is always right, and through birth or adoption, you are a mother nonetheless.

One of the things I miss most is the ability to believe that I will ever again be strong and healthy. Life just seems too damn sad most of the time, and what joy I find comes in little pieces, and most of them when I’m writing (I write far more than I share) or spending time with Peggy. I figure that as long as I have her, I can put up with almost anything. I’m 62, and I’ve never been alone or even wanted to be alone. In three months, she and I will have been married forty years—we met in August and were married that December. Scores of people have passed through my life since I met Peggy, but somehow she has remained.

As I said way up there at the beginning of this post there hasn't been much goin' on this week to write about, but I will do my best. Here are a few of the items that I've been spinning as of late, and as usual you know what you can do with 'em!

As everyone watches the rock illuminate absolutely nothing in the pond, there’s a shimmering, crackling sound to the side. Grift turns to find himself face to face with the wrinkly visage of a crone, craning forward from the impossibly huge, black bulk of a giant spider. Its fangs sink deep into the boy’s shoulders, pumping in venom even as the blood gushes forth. In response, Grift’s mouth spews froth as he drops to the ground.

No, this has nothing to do with Sgt. Pepper. I realized recently that the date was sticking in my head...that something had happened that I should remember. And then it hit me - it was the anniversary of my first marriage. And not only the anniversary, but twenty years. Wow, that's a long time.
This one is decent.
I think in person conversations can be frustrating. When was the last time you sat around a table with, say, 5 friends and you discussed an issue politely, taking turns, and everyone getting to say everything they want to without interruption? I’m not saying it ISN’T done, but that generally speaking that’s not how it goes down. And sometimes reading someone’s response you get much more of a fuller answer than what they might say out loud to your face.

I still have two pounds of Munich malt that I need to brew with sometime soon. It's been sitting in my cupboard, already cracked, for about a month now. I might try and wedge in a brewing session one day this week after work. The beer would be a saison or farmhouse-style brew as I have some Wyeast 3724 in the fridge along with some Safbrew T-58. I have two batches of saison-style ale already in bottles and it's going fast. The first batch I'm really quite pleased with so far. It has a pleasant bitterness and just a touch of heat in the dry finish from some crushed black pepper. I used Wyeast 3711 for both batches and they fermented super dry, around 85-89 percent attenuated. (Love that yeast!) The hops are all Strisselspalt and add a touch of anise-like spice. The seocnd batch is a little bit different. I added the black pepper, but also some chamomile, which at first showed up with Juicy Fruit bubblegum flavors, but has since faded and is coming across a little bland. I will give this second batch plenty of warm conditioning and maybe it'll develop a little more complexity. The batch I intend to brew will probably have some lemon and orange peel added to it, along with a bit more of black or green peppercorns than the previous batches. I had some Nicie Spicie from Short's on a recent Michigan trip and I'm sort of seeking to emulate it.

A legacy of racing competition runs deep in Chevrolet’s 100-year history, dating to co-founder Louis Chevrolet’s passion for racing automobiles.

The weather is not good for my health. It's not that wet and damp is getting to my lungs, it's just that in this very wet weather ("More than two month's rain in 48 hours" screamed this morning's newspaper) it's not been possible, or sensible to cycle into the office. So having started the year well, it' snow over three weeks since I put foot to pedal. As it's the only exercise I do, I can feeling the muscles wasting away and the flab piling on. So I'm hoping for a turnaround in the the grey skies for the sake of my health and well being.

I don't think it's sensible to call beers by names that reinforce a laddish stereotype in the manner of a 1970s Tetley Bitter advert. Women are 50% of the population, and choosing names that might be seen as sexist will deter some potential female customers, not just for those particular beers, but perhaps for beer in general; this can't be good business sense, irrespective of whether you think they have had a humour bypass. In this case, though, I'm sure Slaters are loving all the publicity of being banned by Parliament.
In the package I included instructions on how to curl up with the quilt and read books and if she should spill some cocoa or tea on it then I also included laundering instructions. I told her it is a utility quilt that is to be used because the more she launders it, the softer it will become. She has been told that there is nothing more annoying than a gift quilt that is put on a shelf and left untouched. :-)

Mrs. Obama has been wooing Mayors since before she formally launched the Let's Move! campaign; in January of 2010, Mrs. Obama "previewed" her anti-obesity initiative during an address to the US Conference of Mayors. A month later, Mayor Johnson and Mayor Curtatone, who will attend today's summit, joined the First Lady at the White House for the official launch of the Let's Move! campaign. Both Mayors spoke at the event.

But in fact the metaphysical poets of the 17th century also grappled with such issues. Consider this fragment from John Donne’s An Anatomy of the World:
That reminds me that it's been years since I have actually stopping writing. I mean using a pen. So the occasionally writing that I do, turns out to be a tortuous exercise. The most funny things will be when my colleagues are trying to understand what I wrote. I request them to stop even trying! I once told them that I used to have a pretty handwriting. They won't believe me seriously. Then I told them that I said it was pretty but not whether it was legible or readable! I was in love with my own handwriting for a long time. Now I hardly ever want to look at it. Well for one reason I can't understand it myself, second I will feel very low, thinking why on earth I am not gifted with a beautiful writing. And of course I won't tell you about singing!

June 11, 2011 — An expert in forensic entomology states he found flies related to decomposition in the trunk of Casey’s car. Orange County crime scene investigators identify a piece of Henkel brand duct tape found at the scene and testify it is the same brand as George Anthony put on the red gas can. One states that no Henkel brand tape was found else where in Anthony’s home.
Ferdinand Porsche was near the end of his life when the first Porsche car was built in 1948. But he had been building and designing cars for almost 50 years, including a hybrid at the turn of the 20th century, the iconic supercharged Mercedes-Benz SSK sports cars of the 1920s, the rear-engined Auto Union Silver Arrows, the Volkswagen, and finally, along with his son, the car that bore his name.
Now David had an idea of why he was given the little stone. The shopkeeper could use him as a selling point. “Only ten in the world and David Tirlson has one of them." Although if the woman had more business sense, she would have given it to Cassandra instead. Cassandra was much more famous.

The kitchen’s creativity really came to the fore with desserts. The first, a palate cleansing Lemon Cream with Daikon Radish and Unsweetened Sugar (kaolin) sounds strange on paper but worked exceedingly well – the mild vegetable coming together harmoniously with the gently acidic frozen cream.
But with four restaurants and the “assumption that it dilutes the brand” is it maybe too late? The food at these celebrity chef chains is not chain food. Perhaps, however, it would be better for chefs who want to open multiple restaurants to make them a bit more different from each other. The first place to start might be with the name. Because no matter the differences in menu (shown in particular in the Momofuku restaurants which have the main restaurant and a more affordable noodle bar), if it sounds like a chain it might come off as one.
I'm so happy with the way this card turned out! I've had the image from Beccy's Place colored for quite some time but haven't had a suitable sketch/layout. Until last Wednesday... I thought Splitcoast Stampers sketch challenge #355 was perfect for this.
“No I don't think it would be all that good”, he said, “imagine all the people you love dying. I mean, you'd get bored eventually wouldn't you? Your heart would break again and again.

“Abandoned Toy Factory, Detroit, AKA O’Connor, Perth, Western Australia. Detroit is a shrinking city. In the few decades that Perth, Western Australia has gained a million residents, Detroit, Michigan, has lost a million. Mostly whiteys. Mostly. Look, I could totally check that, and prove it as fact. Right in front of me, I have the “Atlas of Shrinking Cities”. Picked it up at the Bahaus bookshop this year. That’s in Germany. Dessau, Germany. Atlas der schrumpfenden Städte. A’s with dots, you can’t make that shit up. 2006, Phillipp Oswalt und Tim Reieniets. Henning Schirmel, you know it. So, I just checked, Detroit 1950, 1,849,568 heads. Perth 1950, 312 thousand. Who gives a fuck. There’s no point. This is O’Connor, not Detroit. But, for a few hours last month, it was Detroit. Here’s an abandoned Wooden Toy Factory, and some other shots of O’Connor, one of Perth’s most serene and beautiful locales. If Bali was our 911, O’Connor is, our Detroit.”
Greatness takes time, patience, and effort Heck forget greatness, just being good takes time, patience, and effort. When we rush our efforts, they often go awry. Failure is not the be all end all. However, when we fail as leaders it is not solely a personal disappointment but one for the group as well. It’s like watching the poll results come in on election night; everyone is happy until their candidate comes out and concedes the race. The people working on the campaign feel the disappointment just as bad as the losing candidate. When we rush through our events, meetings, and lives, we all but concede the race. The TDE can needlessly sap all the energy and motivation from you and your group. It’s strong enough to stop a movement.
“I mean, if you ask them, what’s their big economic plan in addition to tax cuts for rich folks, it’s dismantling your unions. After all you’ve done to build and protect the middle class, they make the argument you’re responsible for the problems facing the middle class,” Obama added.

4 Tips to Unmasking Emotions
Having been on a balloon flight before, I’m envious of the people on this one. Looks like they are getting an awesome sunset from their lofty vantage point.
And then there’s the metamorphosis issue. At the sight of the BB’s (boobs and buttocks) it goes from teeny weenie to “Got Tent?” and I suppose that can lead to serious vagina envy. Us gals can get all hot and bothered and no one is the wiser. Those padded bras offer more than just added cleavage.
"While the efforts taken by the department to strengthen patent offices in recent past is praiseworthy, the initiative to outsource prior art search is not proving fruitful, for want of statutory mandate and more particularly due to lack of any search analysis on novelty and inventive step by URDIP, CSIR as the searchers are sending only the cited document number which is of no practical use to examiners. Further the report send by CSIR are not in user friendly format requiring double time consumption by examiners. The Patent Act provides for search and examination to be conducted by the same examiner – a practice which even EPO has recently adopted under their BEST (Bringing Examination and Search Together) practices. As stated above, the search reports received from CSIR hardly serves the required purpose as the concerned examiner has to conduct fresh search for assessment of novelty and inventive step to satisfy himself as mandated under statute. Therefore no outsourcing can be probably thought of without bringing suitable changes in the statutory provisions. Alternatively outsourcing agencies for digitization, searches should be brought under CGPDTM on the pattern of JPO as internal agencies working for CGPDTM."

Thursday already? I guess I can't complain, the weekend's right around the corner! I'm not going to lie though, this week has been a little stressful life-wise. We've been looking into moving into a different neighborhood, looking at different options as far as apartments go, and that's enough to send me into a stressed frenzy, weird dreams and all. I envy those "Type A" personalities who can decide they want to do something, and then GET IT DONE. The thought of moving is overwhelming to me though, I mean, we only just settled in to our place. The bright side is that we never fully unpacked from Massachusetts. Also, I've been putting off doing my taxes. I had four jobs last year- though I feel there's a fifth I'm forgetting about- plus we got married, plus we moved. It makes me want to hide under a rock. How do you deal with stress? I try to make it to the gym as much as I can when I'm stressed out, but even then, it's hard to find the time. When I'm home, I try to just focus on one thing at a time.
life, dry.
Julie West, a struggling and dedicated jockey, pins her dreams of an elusive win on the new trainer in town, never suspecting she’s a person of interest–and not because of her riding skills.
Stay strong
Jews, perhaps the eternal scapegoats, catch it in the neck even from people they’re trying to help. When Crusaders set out in 1096 to retake the Holy Land, Mr. Campbell says, they stopped off in the Rhine Valley and slaughtered Jews—”many of whom had lent the money the Crusaders needed to set out on this religious quest in the first place.” Mass murder can also be seen as a very effective way to cancel a debt.
“As soon as your parents and Bethany arrive, we can leave. William, I’m surprised that you didn’t stop for Bethany on your way. She was probably waiting for you…”
“Because I slate The Saturdays, people think: ‘Why are you doing a song with The Wanted? Isn’t that hypocritical?’ But as well as being an artist, I’m a songwriter. If you’re a plumber and someone says: ‘Come around my house and fix my pipes’, you’re not going to say ‘f*ck off, that’s not cool. You’re going to go: ‘Let me see if I can sort it out.’”
“Given the current financial instability of the banking industry, it is highly unlikely that the banks, if they accept the IOUs at all, will be able to do so for any sustained period of time,” Chiang said.
I love pudding but when you put that velvety heaven in a bed of crunchy graham crackers crumbs - well let's just say the word "nirvana" comes to mind.

I am now in control of my finances with the help and guidance of God.
What? you have more to spend? Hold off there sparky, It is not worth it to spend more than that on one pen at this level. Let's move on and since you asked: stay away from brush pens or pen and pencil sets. Too quirky and too predictable. (In that order.) If you want to spend more, go with a combo gift (details below.)
I have gotten away from blogging recently, as you have probably noticed. While I was having problems, I spent so many weeks hunched over my keyboard that I sort of needed a break. I have been working on this post for awhile and it is coming very slow, so I decided to publish the first part, even though it is not even close to being finished.
Today, my card uses a Whiff of Joy stamp which hasn't seen the light of day for a while, such a shame because I think it's an adorable image. I do tend to forget about some of my older stamps and get too caught up in new things.
Does anyone believe those millions of young men who died for this land would not recoil in horror at what has become of it. They did not for one instant imagine they were dying so that greedy self serving politicians could replace their grandchildren in their home land. They did not die so Britain could be given to Islam.
An intruder with a handgun had barely come inside the apartment when it happened, recalled the man who lives there.
Logically, there might have to be a fall-back position, where the executive can draw down maintenance funds, pending approval, to keep basis services going – or not. If Congress does not approve the budget in the US, it falls. That tends to concentrate minds. Only, in this case, it is the people who stop the money. And money talks.
It is shameful to admit this because we'd all like to pretend that we captivate the hearts of all of our students and they sing our praises all day long. But that would be a lie. Every great teacher has some kids who just don't like them. And I've got one for sure this year. I have my suspicions.
The most important victory for the mill workers in this phase was that their right over a part of the mill lands was recognized, and they were promised housing and alternate jobs, all of which was meant to save the area known as Girangaon, and therefore the identity, heritage and ethos of Mumbai. It was also an important gain in principle for the city. However the govt and the mill owners drastically cut down the size land that was due under the 1/3 formula by applying it only to ‘vacant land’ in the mill premises.
And more of us will, if more people will give.

Though UNESCO was supposedly reformed in the last decade after a long history of being one of the most corrupt and politically biased (against Israel) of all the UN’s agencies, the reality is that the rhetoric we have heard from the president and Secretary of State Clinton about its value to the world is largely fluff. It continues to show its prejudice against Israel in efforts to treat Jewish holy sites in Hebron, Bethlehem and Jerusalem as Muslim shrines and to oppose archeological digs in Israel’s capital as attempts to “Judaize” the city.
This was the first time even I ate an eggs benedict with a spoon. Let's just say that the eggs were similar to those you can get at ya kun or any local coffee stall. Their hollandaise sauce was however amazing. Not too rich and it has that tangy taste to it that leaves me craving for more. But hmm Eggs + spoon = big nono for me.
I found a British 1969 reprint of the book in a crate outside an antiquarian bookshop, together with a very amusing looking thing called Night Slaves that I can’t wait to put my eyes on. The summary on the back is as follows:
Will cocked his head to the side. "Michael, give it a rest. Show us you're a man, eh?"
Well...it's still raining here but I am not really complaining, I have found a secret area between my weeping cherry and the patio where primroses grow. They are growing there without so much as a 'by your leave' and I am digging them up and replanting them in the borders...then it rains and I find more baby ones, then I dig them up, replant and then more grow!!! it's amazing and I love it! Anyway must dash...we're off to Lisa's to play with the kids. Just one more thing....can anyone let me know please, if I still have that awful verification robot thing on the comments-I dislike it so much on other blogs now I am worried I still have it on mine. Here's wishing you a great weekend.
Living with a little one can put you in a tizzy.
You also have to see a physician if you have vaginal hpv warts. This type of wart is highly contagious and may be transferred to another individual in the course of anal, oral or genital intercourse. Females that contract this type of wart will usually have the warts within the cervix. So it is difficult to know if she has them and may infect her companion without having knowledge of it.
The day started in a rush for me compare to my usual mornings. I jumped in the shower, made daughter breakfast, made myself a coffee and peanut butter toast to go and we all hopped in the jeep to meet the real estate agent.
Just before the film was about to start, the projector guy narrowly squeezed himself between me sitting on the stool, which was a foot from the piano, and the wall, which was also a foot away, nearly hitting his head on the hanging lantern, 6 inches above. Oh no. I’d taken his stool! I felt bad. I kept offering to move and sit on the floor, but he kept refusing to claim the seat that was rightfully his. Nice fellow.
Of course after this there were more hills, and with every downhill was the dreaded uphill. Although, downhills still sucked real bad because they were basically out of control descents. We were now about 2 miles in and really feeling it with a heat index of 105 degrees. Talk about sweating bullets. Each of us lost about 7 to 10 pounds in water weight alone.
But what if the anti-Rae ad really isn't about hurting Rae? What if it's really designed to hurt the NDP? Well, if that's the case then the Tory attack ad makes perfect sense. And indeed, I believe that is the case.
Tomorrow I am joining forces with my SIL at her garage sale. Every year I shop it and score! This year I hope to sell enough to cover my shopping addiction! Join us in Merion Village, we will be set up at 197 E Moler St.

The scene was filmed on an early Sunday morning in November 2000 and they had to shoot quickly. Their efforts to create an eerie setting were almost thwarted by the Dow Jones news ticker, in the background proclaiming details about the disputed Bush-Gore election. They were given permission to digitally erase the information.
Now it seems these same institutional ‘smart money’ traders are backing away slowly from the massive short position that they have built up. The open interest put call ratio is lethargically dropping and the volume put call ratio has fallen from its recent peak at 2.12 to just 1.55 – the lowest since February 2011.

We had a wonderful, mostly-local Dark Days dinner tonight. Roasted pork tenderloin, mashed potatoes, rutabagas, and a Cuban-style "gravy" that's just olive oil heated very hot and poured over a combination of minced garlic, sliced onions, lemon juice, and a healthy dose of garlic powder (I don't like typical flour-and-drippings gravy - but this garlicky treat is just fabulous!!).

The pattern is ZigZag Top by Marianne Isager and the yarn is "Stahlsche Wolle" Silk-Cotton, that I got for 50 Cent a ball at my lys in the bargain bin. I only paid 5,00 Euro for 10 skeins and I have some left. I already wrote to the owner, if she had more, so I can make another one, this time making it a tad smaller!
I SCREAM as I feel it pouring down my legs.
Most trust with what i call a “one eye open” approach. Always expecting the other shoe to fall, or even believing that because something good happens, then something bad must be right around the corner.
So it is us, that they see as wrong, and must be changed at all costs. They did not drink in the pubs, so what matter that they are closing, in fact they do not drink at all, so what matter minimum pricing, they hold no allegiance except to themselves, so what matter the destruction of the country.
Hey hey lovelies, the first day of December here and Summer yay! Cant wait, hope his summer is lovely and warm so I can rock some cute summer outfits ;)
For the frosting beat the cocoa powder, vanilla, cream cheese, and butter together until fluffy. Seriously you guys, I’m a fluffy nazi. Just make it fluffy. Its not hard. Unless you’re that retarded child with bad parents. Shoo shoo retard flu! Anyway, add in the powdered sugar and enough green food coloring to make it green without being that horrible baby-poop green color that you get when you mix green and brown. Sorry,that was gross but I don’t know any other way to describe that color.

The apogee and perigee of the Moon denotes the distance of the Moon from the Earth. The apogee is the point when the Moon is furthest from the earth. The perigee is the point when it is closest. When a perigee moon is also full, the visible difference in brightness and size can be dramatic.
When we come to God, humble and sincere, earnestly seeking, He will give us the answers we are seeking. All we have to do is pray to Him. Heavenly Father, are you there? Are you listening? Do you care about me? Am I important to you? I'm trying to do my best here. I want to be better. I want to follow the truth. Can you help me?
Honey Irani appears in front of the camera in one of her first roles as an actress playing the mean and spoilt mommy’s girl Sheila. I love the way she stands and screams as an iron burns her sari rather than just lifting out a hand to move it away. She really does seem to believe she is the delicate flower her mother calls her and she wonderfully nasty towards her cousin. Ranjeet is appropriately sleazy and obviously the villain once he turns up in a selection of increasingly bad shirts and terrible scarves.
Pure awesome, ALL the time.
So when I was sent a journal from the awesome fellas over at www.officehero.co.uk I was skeptical. I felt like I had been there before. I thought..here’s a big lined journal that wouldn't hold up to anything. I was wrong. Introducing the Black n Red A4 sized Smart Ruled Journal.

For answer Hilda swirled towards the road. For one awful moment she feared she’d forgotten her wand at home, but after a slight fluster of “Where?” and “Boo!” she produced it with a flourish. Focusing very hard on the curved shape and luxurious colors of human coaches, she gently flicked her wand. The road trembled slightly as a giant, and garishly orange vehicle appeared.
The breakfast room is a glass box that extends beyond the main volume to capture views of Indian Creek and the morning sun. The main vertical element, at the core of the residence, is a 25’ diameter void that houses a partially suspended stair that spirals from a 9’ width at the ground level to a 3.5’ width at the roof garden on the third level.
Yesterday was the worst game the Pirates have played all season. So we’re not going to talk about it anymore. Erik Bedard goes for the bucs after picking up his first win of the season in Atlanta on Saturday night. Bedard could possibly be 5-0 but the pirates have not gotten much runs for him this season. Jake Westbrook will face the pirates for the second time his season. He pitched on Saturday the 21st, the bucs won that game. Andrew McCutchen has owned Westbrook in his career going 6-14 which comes out to be a .429 average, also no current pirates has a home run against Westbrook, so maybe some one like Pedro Alvarez can change that after another 2 hit game last night.

The next time someone thought to take a picture of me on a fishing trip, I was standing in front of my stepfather’s old gray 1940 Pontiac, holding a string of fish so heavy I could barely lift it .
In running a major non-profit dedicated to the needs of more than 2.3 million men and women who’ve served the country in the Middle East (and more than 200,000 Member Veterans who are actively involved in the organization), Rieckhoff says that the hardest part is maintaining the funds necessary to provide top-quality services. He explains that the major funding organizations that give to non-profits don’t always have veteran services in their list of causes, so there’s no guaranteed cash flow to tap into.

Why did I write such a long book? Why? It's like I enjoy punishing myself! It's not that there's any problem with the edits themselves. It's just that I've been trying to get them done all week while at the same time being frantically busy with other stuff (like vet appointments, optician's appointments and major cleaning/gardening projects) which means that instead of being able to blissfully barricade myself in the Writing Cave, I've been snatching ten minutes here and half an hour there, always keeping one eye on the ticking clock. I hate that.
But not all worship moments involve emotional intensity, there are some that equal the fervor of a Sunday morning worship time in a Charismatic church, but there are others where you don’t respond the same, but in your heart, there is no doubt about giving credit to Whom credit is due…
One folder contained pictures taken at Serenity Falls back in March, 2009. We discovered Serenity Falls in the autumn of 2008 when we were visiting waterfalls around Cosby, Tennessee, on ‘the quiet side of the Smokies’.
Here is my back of the napkin answer to this question.
Lanore is forced to tell her family who send her away to Boston to have the baby, away from the prying eyes of those that will spread gossip and rumours about her misfortune; effectively ruining her for any chance of marriage in future. The tale would be too simple and plain if our dear heroine were to safely follow her father’s instructions, have the baby, and travel home, back to her Jonathan. No, she decides to attempt to make it on her own, and is picked up a troupe of strange Europeans, including one Count Adair cel Rau.
His wife can't remember him, his son thinks he's dead, He doesn't even know why he gets out of bed.
In a bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, lemon zest, salt, and pepper until fully combined. Pay attention to the size of your pie pan when determining the correct number of eggs to use. I used a 9 in. baking dish with rather high sides so I had a lot of room to accommodate that much filling. It will rise just a tiny bit when cooking so If you have extra filling just leave it aside. You bake it in a small ramekin and use it to make a delicious egg sandwich for breakfast someday!
Mars; Athene favours heroes of intelligence, however mortal. It’s like Dynasty with extra war, bitchery,
2. What’s most troubling to me about the use of “white people problems” as a jokey rejoinder is that it seems to imply that non-white people don’t use computers, or go to restaurants, or get cable TV, or exist in a world where our common, petty annoyances with such things apply.
Since all this lack of candy, Mexican, Italian etc will only (hopefully) lead to weight loss, why not make it official? I was catching up on my sort of e-boss’s blog (randomcommands.com) and was checking out all of the stuff that he accomplishing with diet, exercise and apps. Yeah, apps.

2. Go to DIY place, realise I have left measurement behind.
On Friday night, he suggested we photograph the sunset. As cliche as yet another sunset photo might be, I love taking them and quickly agreed. But as we drove to our destination, the sun slipped beneath the horizon and the moon slid behind a slice of clouds.

Spoon yogurt onto folded paper towl and place in refrigerator for 20 minutes to drain and thicken or try using greek yogurt. In a medium bowl, whisk buttermilk, yogurt and mayo until smooth. Add vinegar and sugar and whisk. Stir in blue cheese and season to taste.

Stretch the dough into a large rectangle and run the rolling pin over to even out the thicker parts. Leaving a small boarder along all sides, spread on the filling and drizzle over the oil, butter, and bacon fat. Sprinkle on some mozzarella cheese.
Nevertheless, the Committee admitted that households with electric heating (9% of the UK) could be disproportionately affected by future costs of low-carbon measures as these will predominantly fall on electricity bills.
But there was more to the ISI information. Qadir was able to obtain a detailed account from ISI officers involved in the bin Laden investigation showing that ISI also told the CIA that it suspected that Khan might be linked to terrorism.
I was really pleased I took the gambit to come down for the night, being the flake I am it was a thin line. For those who like the sound of what I’ve just described to you, they’re out there playing gigs to this day. Check out their facebook page for event details and a few studio versions of their songs. I have to say though that I prefer the live versions of the songs that are online that I heard that night, but then that formula generally follows for a lot of bands!
*************************************************************************************I assume that everyone has heard of Seasonal Affective Disorder. It is a mood disorder like Bipolar Disorder.

This one is recommended by reader Bittersweet, Black Jade perfume which is a modern recreation of Marie Antoinette's favourite (and last) fragrance she wore before the revolution claimed her life. The historic perfume house Lubin created the fragrance for the Queen, and the original ingridients for the fragrance were kept in the perfumers books.
ETA: I also had a partner say with a happy sigh, between songs in a lovely vals tanda,"It's so nice to have a dance with a social partner..." Hm!
Bedbugs are small, full grown about 3/16 to ¼ inch long and reddish brown in color. Their nutrition comes from blood meals, normally from humans. They tend to hide very well and come out only to feed once they sense warm temperatures and carbon dioxide (from exhaling). They have piercing mouthparts with which they pierce the human skin then draw the blood through a tube. This feeding behavior or mechanism is in part the reason that the current pesticides are not providing effective control. I will revisit this issue in a moment.

Today I made a card for my husband. I hope he likes it! He is so sweet! Our local Costco has assorted ribbon for sale this week and he surprised me with a box of really fun ribbons! He also got me an electric cup warmer to keep my cappuccino's warm!
So I spoke to a good friend of mine out of the blue one day, we always seem to separate for long periods of time and come back together at the right time. We’re family in many ways. He’s like a spirit guide for me. I can speak to him about my own iniquities and not feel judged. He is a genuinely great guy, and I’m not just saying that because he’s a fellow Leo. We’re apart of the pride so we understand each other. Real humble dude.

Yesterday, my mom and I submitted my official enrollment and housing deposit to Syracuse University. In a matter of months I will be in New York as a college student. This is my Californian dream. I will be giving up the comfort of Californian weather and the hospitality of my adoring parents in order to build on to my already amazing life. I am ready for this sacrifice because, obviously, adventure is out there.
“What we also know…is that in previous cases animals that have higher loads of pollutants in their body will fall easier victims to these kind of diseases because their immune system is weakened.”
Now look at those cuties and try to tell me you don't love peas and carrots!!! I double dog dare you.
Not too much, I have more editing to accomplish and maybe a greater push to get more out there. But I didn't hit the bestsellers list or win any Nobel Prizes in literature, so my life is pretty much still the same. Where I've changed is my outlook on approaching marketing and editing. I've learned to promote myself more, and not be so scared. Yep, all that putting yourself out there can be somewhat scary, but I'm learning. Maybe I should be glad I haven't hit the big time yet, I might not have been able to handle it, at first.
The evening concluded with singing along to traditional tunes and enjoying a final glass of Bowmore. Although bizarre and very theatrical, I found that the event nonetheless managed to capture a very real and genuine enthusiasm for an excellent whisky. I highly recommend both the event (if they’re running any more, or anything similar) and Bowmore, for which my fondness has deepened even further.
I’m not really thinking. I’m never really thinking. I think I’m thinking but then, I realise I’m back to square one and topic A and I just can’t…
We still have our two Golden Retrievers, Duke and Ellie, our Basset Hound Sorsha, along with Tiffany’s dog Butter, and my mom’s dog Teddy. With five dogs, things can get a little chaotic. Last weekend we were trying to figure out why different sections of our pre-lit, 12 ft, Christmas tree were occasionally going out and then magically starting up again. Finally we realized that the Basset Hound, Sorsha, was hiding out under the tree and brushing up against the plugs.
Here is this morning’s interview with Petula Clark.
NSA personnel can control the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US by using the NSA’s domestic intelligence network and cover businesses. The operations independently run by them can sometimes go beyond the bounds of law. Long-term control and sabotage of tens of thousands of unwitting citizens by NSA operatives is likely to happen. NSA DOMINT has the ability to assassinate US citizens covertly or run covert psychological control operations to cause subjects to be diagnosed with ill mental health.
The beer was really starting to hit me fast at this point. I got to know the hamburgler. She was this cute red head. I have a thing for red heads I don't know why, but I like it and don't ever want to change. She was cool and a whole lot of fun.

Kya Kool Hai Hum follows two boys with opposite personalities on their quests for love. Rahul, played by Tusshar, is hardworking while Jai, portrayed by Riteish, is all about the fun. In this adventure, Rahul is a suspect in a serial rape, killer case getting the boys in a lot of sticky situations. Inspector Urmila, played by Isha Koppikar, goes undercover and tries to seduce Rahul to bring out his true identity.
AT&T’s new U-verse service doesn’t have to play by all the rules that cable TV companies do. But it should play by one: It should offer viewers the same quality public affairs broadcasts that cable viewers now enjoy.
A very well done film with good action and a bit of a thriller feel. Period pieces are not for everyone, especially Shakespearian type stories and time period. This is a well done story and while it takes a few liberties I’m sure, it’s entertaining none the less. It’s not a movie that is going to have a break out star or one with any major players, although Vanessa Redgrave gives some heft to the acting ability to the cast. No one actor stands out above any of the other.
I did enjoy the character ‘The Gardener’. His presence is constant and silently raking away. He comments on each of the characters calling them visitors, hence the title ‘Visitation’.

The 1.5” white foam quickly disappears from the transparent, pale yellow liquid. At first draw, Lone Star brings strange aromas of processed canned chicken broth, corn adjuncts, and wet grain sack…better drink this from the bottle. When the fizzy brew hits the lips, alcohol is most prominent with a slight metallic tinge which allows flavors of purple grape peel, canned cream corn, and bran cereal to dominate - zero hop profile. Thin carbonation somewhat creamy from the adjuncts. If I was at a bar and they had $1 Lone Star (Thursday's at Pacesetter), I could drink a few of these – from the bottle.
Hooray for another Fabric Friday today! Today's project is a Passport & Travel Documents Holder that I saw on Pinterest. I kind of followed the tutorial from THIS BLOG.

Labour now stands with Fine Gael and Fianna Fail in supporting household and water charges – despite expensive media ads opposing them before the elections. Labour should be reminded of this cynical betrayal. Labour politicians who say they oppose the tax, but remain in a party pushing it through, can only be seen as opportunist. While Sinn Fein has said it opposes the household tax, it has unfortunately ruled out putting its resources behind supporting non-payment, which is the only way this rip-off can be defeated. This will no doubt disappoint many Sinn Fein voters.
By far my favorite inclusion in the novel however was Grubb's nod to Brian Daley with the inclusion of the Corporate Sector Authority. Lt. Commander Angela Krin of the CSA is the officer in charge of the blockade of the plague world of Endregaad and features prominently in the events of Scourge. If you haven't read about Han and Chewie's adventures in the Corporate Sector then check out Brian Daley's Han Solo Trilogy.
He loves to: count to 100 :: read words from his "homework book" :: show us the letter/number they worked on that day :: loves getting a new library book each week :: has made some great friends :: he is getting good at reading signs, names of stores etc around town :: sing songs they learn in class :: and much more i'm sure.
There’s this one scene where Detective Black decides to go into Exposition Mode and rattle off this story about Vietnam and superstitions and all of this, and really, why even bother, movie? You’re trash, and have nothing worthwhile to contribute at all.

The RB5 that preceded this year’s car, already had high placed rear wishbones, and this allowed the subsequent car to run exhausts mounted low down and exit well below the wishbone, avoiding any overheating issues of the carbon fibre components. Teams have run exhausts in very close proximity to the wishbones now for many years, the differing strategies teams employ reduce the thermal load on the carbon fibre wishbones. Either gold foil film, extra carbon fibre heat shield or these are often coated with ceramic finishes to reflect heat. This latter finish being made obvious by the matt silver finish tot he parts. Sauber have run these on their top rear wishbone for many years. The heat shield even having a small air inlet to feed cooling air in-between the heat shield and wishbone beneath. Teething troubles may be expected as the teams start to run the new exhaust positions, but the heat protection will be a solution relatively easy to overcome.

Mary had in mind those Covenant promises that the Lord had made to Abraham and his seed and the eternality of the promises (verses 54, 55; Genesis 12:1-3; 17:7). The word “remember” (verse 59) is another Covenant word. When “The children of Israel cried out” in their bondage in Egypt, “their cry rose up to God. So God heard their groanings and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob” (Exodus 2:23, 24; 6:5). The reference to the Lord’s “arm” (verse 51) also takes us back to their deliverance from Egypt with a “strong hand” and “an outstretched arm” (Exodus 6:1, 6; Psalm 59:10).
But they also spoke of the inhuman cruelty a part of her was so capable of–and still able–and this was something she wasn’t prepared to confront or deal with.

3) People knocking on my car window when I’m innocently sitting in a parking lot drinking my coffee and writing in my blog. Just because I’m sitting in a car doesn’t mean I have a ton of spare change. I donate to places almost daily and work for a non profit that doesn’t pay me enough to help additional homeless people, no matter how much I want to. I can give you the location of the nearest shelter or food pantry, though. And if my window is closed it means I’m not in the mood to talk to strangers. I need a “do not disturb” sign for my car window because this happens almost daily.

1. Start collecting addresses. I’m serious. Even before you’ve decided on the invitation. I would suggest creating a guest list using TheKnot because it can later become a master guest list from which you can import guests into other guest lists (like the bridal shower, bachelorette party, rehearsal dinner). & to which you can also grant access to those most involved in the planning, parents, maid of honor.

At the close of his life, Paul wrote in 2 Timothy 4:7, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.” That testimony could and should be yours at the close of your life.
DiLorenzo kicks the pedestal out from under Lincoln. He objects to kowtowing at Lincoln’s alter — and rightfully so. Why so many would persist in perpetuating this man’s legacy in positive light is beyond me. When it comes to Lincoln, the bottom line is that before the War between the States, government in America was highly decentralized and limited as envisioned by the founding fathers. “The war created the highly centralized state that Americans labor under today. The purpose of American government was transformed from the defense of individual liberty to the quest for empire.” (p. 2) And the truth shall set you free!
It’s very rare for a film to pull me toward the edge of my seat every time I watch it, but Summer Wars manages to do just that. It is very grounded and down-to-earth, and at the same time it features great action sequences and a compelling premise that anyone in our social network society can relate to. It draws you into both the dazzling world of OZ and the seemingly ordinary life of a closely-knit family.
The underlying problem is one of selection bias: if an intelligent and informed person thinks the Bible is probably true and therefore significant, he or she is more likely to pursue a career in biblical study and then publish his or her findings (confirming that the Bible is true). If, however, an identically-qualified person thinks the Bible is probably false and therefore not significant, he or she is dramatically less likely to trundle off to seminary regardless, and is exponentially less likely to publish his or her findings confirming that the Bible is false. Robert M. Price is the rare exception — someone who finds Christianity to be false historically but nevertheless powerfully inspiring, and therefore worth devoting his life to studying. (Richard Carrier is another exception — someone who finds Christianity to be false and is active in the atheist community. But these are the proverbial exceptions that prove the rule.)
And .... bitchy.

Mikal and I were roommates and worked together, and after the Shaved Pigs called it quits, he got me listening to The Specials… he was good friends with Dave Doris and I was friends with Nightmare and thought he’d make a great front man. We recruited Brian, who was friends with a skinhead friend and we got together and started working on music. The satan concept was a natural fit – believe me!
I’ve had the same scale for quite a long time – at least seven years. In previous posts, I mentioned that it gives me a whole lot of information, some of which is unclear to me. There is one number that has always stood out, a horrific insult pointing and laughing at me every single time I step on the scale. For as long as I have had this scale, it has told me that I have a metabolic age of fifty. Fifty! You can imagine how I felt when I was told that I had a metabolic age of fifty when I was only in my mid twenties.
In Mercedes case the rocker is packaged the other side of the gear cluster, just under the gearboxes cross shaft. This leaves little room for the antiroll bar and heave spring. It does however place the rocker and torsion bars very low for the benefit of packaging, aero and CofG. Albeit these are small benefits, perhaps Mercedes choice of a short wheel base did not leave space for the suspension to be packaged around the clutch, as the gearbox length is a critical factor in wheelbase length.

“I was twenty-eight once too, you know, and I had dreams, big dreams.” Her blue eyes glazed over for a moment. “I wanted to be a movie star, and I could have, too. I was damn good, like you are at what you do, and I was once beautiful, believe it or not.” She winked at me, but there were tears in her eyes. I knew about Betty’s dreams from long ago. I also knew that there was a part of her life that hadn’t been so good, and it was that part, which had changed the course of her life. If only I had known her back then, but I hadn’t been alive yet. I could have made it easier for her. Although, it had been decades since the trauma she’d endured had passed leaving a large scar on her heart, I could still help in a small way. I laid my hand on top of hers. Ten seconds later, her tears were gone and the scar from the past was lessened and she continued.

I know I knew who Sharon Chreech was growing up , but I guess the only thing she really had out when I was in elementary school that I’d heard of was her Newbery Award-winning book, Walk Two Moons. I don’t really remember what that was about anymore, but I remember my sister loved Bloomability when she was little. I’ve been having fun discovering her books as an adult, and read Granny Torelli Makes Soup and The Castle Corona last year, and now Unfinished Angel. All were quick reads that told very real stories in different but refreshing ways.
These initial attempts to further immortalize Star Wars in cartoon form fell short, I believe, as a result of being too childish. Just because something is a cartoon does not automatically exclude it from some appeal with older audiences, nor does it relegate the show to daytime toddler audiences.

I must say I was shocked. I was too happy this morning. I didn’t think it was that much. but I’m glad for the loss. I seen this size last year around this time. I started the month of April off at . I have lost 18.9 lbs in 30 days. I’m so happy. I want to thank everyone that gave me the motivation and word of encouragement. I probably would have lost a little more, had I had a bowel movement. I haven’t had one in a couple days, so I guess I will be some more of that Milk of Magnesium…lol. I also did my measurements today as well. For some reason I didn’t think I did them right, but here they are.

CRACKED definitely isn’t a “I’m going to intentionally try and teach the reader a lesson” kind of book. Truthfully, I find those types of books unsatisfying. I want to come to my own understanding from the story and the characters, not be bonked over the head with an author’s message.

Let’s consider again the particular claims of the argument for ignorance: Does such theology cripple faith? Far from it! Faith is built on theology such as this. Does it keep seekers away? Not likely, because those who come to faith will know Who it is they are believing. Does theology stand in the way of God’s mission? Heavens no! Theology is the blueprint for God’s mission! Does theology cripple the work of reaching people’s hearts? Of course not! What is the point of reaching hearts if you reach them with a falsehood? What is the motive of Christian action if it is not a right understanding of Who God is and what He does?

Since the Cambrian Period about half a billion years ago, carbon dioxide has averaged over 2000 ppm. A doubling of carbon dioxide , which would take more than 150 years on present trends, would have the direct effect of raising the temperature about 1°C but negative feedback (which counters the change, and for which there is overwhelming evidence) would reduce it to less than that. Predictions of increases of 3°C or more are nonsense.

Somewhere in my heart, I’m still trying to make peace with the fact that love is something I cannot control. If I wasn’t so inane at seventeen, I would have realized how I was playing with an immortal facet that transcends all known accounts of sentient life since the history of being. All of which begs me to question: as a human being, do I really have any idea what I’m doing?

In his review, Duncan snickers that knuckle-dragging genre readers will balk at Whitehead's use of terms like "cathected" or "brisant." He makes a point of dropping fancy terms of his own -- I had to scratch my low brow at his reference to "ludic violence." But China Miéville, arguably the most important British fantasist of the current generation, doesn't shield his genre readers from his extensive vocabulary. If Duncan hasn't read Miéville, how about J.G. Ballard and Thomas Disch, British authors who were using lots of them big words in their genre fiction before Glen Duncan learned to stop sucking his thumb? Duncan's assertion that authors must dumb down their language to satisfy genre readers is demonstrably false, and only reveals his own appalling ignorance of the genre he is currently writing in and writing about.

Eleri has been invited to a swimming party tomorrow (but, because the children are all under 8, parents have to go too - not sure if I'm looking forward to that really, but I can't let her down!) I did initially say she wouldn't be able to go because I would need to stay with Andrew and we hadn't got another adult to swim with her - but the boy's Mum said Andrew could come along too! Actually, I could do with a good swim - I do keep telling myself that I'm going to start swimming one evening a week but I keep making excuses for not going - meetings for work, Richard playing squash, Richard cricket training, Richard cricket coaching etc etc. Basically, I'm just plain lazy LOL!

All you need to start on your abundant ‘now’ is to take a minute and see the bigger picture. Whatever part of your life you are viewing in a scarcity mindset, zoom out for a while and see the bigger picture. If you are living in a lack of money life and feel that there is not enough to go around and you have been left out. Take another look at the bigger picture, there are Trillions and Trillions of dollars and pounds in the world and there is more than enough for everyone to share.

The conversation between the two writers is also striking for two more reasons. One, the interview that took place became an impetus for a new story to take place in the novel, for a shift in the direction of the war story that Cercas was trying to finish. The consequence is that the novel was actually finished and the privileged reader (privileged in the sense of being dragged to the adventure like the sidekick Sancho Panza) was privy to how the story reached its conclusion. The other thing to note here is how Bolaño's last statement above was, in fact, Cervantean.

That is a large task. Will you get involved this election year? Grass roots involvement in our political process can and does make a difference.

He just wants us to be able to pick out and walk correctly through the rhythms, but that's not easy. In fact, these are subtleties in the music that casual listening, or casual dancing, would probably ignore, but if you can pick them out and respond to them then a simple basic dance can become full of interest, even just walking and using the simplest steps. But it isn't easy. For instance, a phrase with four repetitions of a double-time might recur later, but with five repetitions of the double time instead of four. All of this means paying very careful attention to what's in the music.
Some people, particularly in Hollywood, like to say that there are no new stories, but that we tell the old stories over and over again. Now, of course, Hollywood does tell the same stories over and over again. It’s part of their business plan, part of their DNA, but that doesn’t mean that that’s all there is. If you think about it, there’s a million stories all around us that Hollywood wouldn’t touch, but that, if told in an interesting way, would certainly hold up to the latest bland rom-com.
I was quietly sitting in a chair meditating on how to be more successful by one of the many circular patches of grass that you can look at but never ever dream of actually walking on (this outdated concept of garden eludes me...what's the point of grass if you can't roll in it?). A group of 10 year old boys were running around the circular path with fake guns, shooting at each other, playing a game. Four mothers stood by watching them and directing the game. A woman of about 50 sat in a chair near me, reading the paper. The game went on for about ten minutes or so and I was enjoying watching the freedom of kids just playing. The reading woman near me was clearly not as the boys kept ducking behind her chair and shooting their guns from behind it which made a CLACK CLACK CLACK sound. Suddenly, without any warning, the woman reaches behind her chair, stands up, grabs the boy's gun out of his hand, screams at him and throws the gun into the trees. The boys all stopped in front of her and yelled back.

Out of print for many years, 2300 AD has finally been revivified as an alternate campaign setting for Mongoose Traveller. The hardcover core campaign setting book is awesome. Weighting in at over 300 pages, it's light on artwork, mostly ship deckplans and planetary maps, but it's heavy on crunchy content. Of course, while the extensive stats on weapons, vehicles, starships and DNA modifications are useful and help to establish the feel of the setting, it is still the fluffier bits that make it interesting. 2300 AD presents a future that is, in many ways, a reflection of the past, in particular, the colonial period. Powerful nation-states compete with one another for habitable planets. Alliances are made and broken. Alien cultures are encountered. For those familiar with the original version, note that the first contacts with the Kaefers have been made, but little information on them (or indeed, any of the alien races) is revealed in the core book. Presumably a future supplement will be forthcoming.

The policy may be under-funded or it could be in danger of lapsing. It could fail to meet the policyholder’s current needs or have the wrong beneficiary—such as a former spouse, rather than a current one. The policyholder’s employment or health situation may have changed. The policy may also be vastly under-performing. Many people who bought variable life insurance policies 10 or 15 years ago were expecting market returns of 8, 10 or even 12 percent. Clearly, those polices have not been performing as expected. Similarly, many fixed interest rate policies that adjust periodically based on interest rate assumptions have been
