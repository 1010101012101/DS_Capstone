Honorable mention to Alice and to Faithy, who both baked from the book but were on somewhat different schedules. Alice thought we were baking the coconut cake this week--if you want to preview that, check out her blog. And Faithy thought it was time for her to make the Devil's Food Cake with Midnight Ganache.
My tree had tender bark that covered massive branches. Each primary branch extended out into full ranks of smaller branches covered in rich, thick leaves. To see the tree from the ground was to visit an enormous work of creation exploding into the sky and billowing out with almost cumulus design. To rest in its soft branches was to fall comfortably into the dreamscape of the clouds themselves.
Furthermore, Singaporeans have less a racial or cultural identity than the Chinese, Indians, and Filipinos and it would not be easy to assimilate them especially when there are so many of them here causing them to congregate within their own communities.

The people of Wooton Bassett were interviewed and they were a rare sight, they are a type of people, although legion in our land, who are not usually welcome on our TV screens. They were not the dissembling creeps who claim to represent us in Parliament, the chattering classes who usually dominate the airways or the mockney accented public schoolboys who pose as entertainers. They were not the slimy treacherous judges or avaricious white hating lawyers who administer what passes for justice in this land, or the broadcasters who learnt to hate us on their Stalin praising fathers' knees. They were the reality of England, a people motivated and filled with love of their country who come to honour the brave and beautiful young men, sacrificed in illegal wars by the crooks and monsters who currently rule over us.

Would you have thought that you could roast and caramelize cauliflower to enjoy like a meaty steak? I raised my eyebrow initially at the idea, but with half a dozen heads of fresh cauliflower from the garden, we were ready to take our weekend dinner path in a different direction. I am not advocating that you replace your juicy steak with cauliflower steaks. However, if you are looking for a fast, super fresh, absolutely delicious alternative...You have come to the right place.
If you have been following along with all the new releases from Christy at Tiddly Inks this last week you will have seen the final new Wryn for the week yesterday. Her name is Wryn - Fairy Friends and I think she might just be my favourite Wryn! She comes with two butterflies and a snail, only me being a bit blond didn't realise that one of the images was a snail and just thought it was an odd looking butterfly... duh! So here's my card (with a blue snail):
I’ve spent all day trying to figure out how to put a positive spin on how much yesterday sucked, and I just can’t do it. So I’m not going to try. There’s no need. Some days are just bad. Some days suck. Some days you give up on yourself. That was yesterday. I gave up on myself so bad, I walked out of the gym. I wasn’t into it and didn’t want any part of it. So I said screw it.

I told her about a Focus on the Family radio program I'd recently listened to. They interviewed a nurse who had spent years working as a nurse in a Planned Parenthood clinic. She was a Christian, and honestly felt like she was doing the world good. One day, they had a guest doctor come in who was a private practice abortion doctor. He did abortion by ultrasound, and this nurse was invited to assist. She was excited, because she'd never done an abortion that way, but had heard of it and wanted the experience. She watched the baby appear on the screen - a fully formed baby at twelve weeks - and watched it startle awake as the probe entered the uterus, then fight to get away from the procedure.

Against all these expenses, the huge advantages of an internal appointment have to be weighed. The risk to the business in appointing an unknown outsider is, after all, considerable. Unlike an internal appointee, the external appointee will need to take time to understand the firm’s culture and behavioural characteristics. He or she will have to gain intimate knowledge of the dynamics of the business, its history, and its strengths and witnesses. Whilst the external appointee will bring objectivity, lateral thinking and advanced management competencies, he or she will have to earn the respect of the partnership, particularly after the honeymoon period is over. In contrast and from day one, the internal appointee will understand intimately the dynamics and politics of the Partnership, and will have detailed industry, market place and competitor knowledge. The internal appointee will also know the firm’s strengths and the opportunities to be exploited as well as being acutely aware of the firm’s weaknesses and the threats and challenges which need to be addressed.

On Thursday, I went to the nuero-ophthalmologist. We spent more time talking than he did examining me. I described all my symptoms. He asked a few questions, did a couple of tests and then sat me down and said that his gut was telling him it was nothing. Then he went on to explain that my symptoms weren't really strong enough to be signs of MS. Apparently, you have dimming in your eyesight for a few weeks and weakness in your muscles. Still vague signs, but mine didn't match up. It was the same with the pseudo brain tumor. He said that he gets a handful of patients like this every year. They see the 'snow' you see on the tv. He puts them through the tests, and 9 times out of 10, its nothing. They can't find anything on any brain scans to explain it.
It's time to go.

To have to put up with the endless waves of immigrants from Africa or the Middle East who demand housing and jobs and support all at the expense of the British people is just breathtaking yet we accept it because we have been brainwashed into agreeing that the meek shall inherit our earth, not theirs. For a white Western country to be held to ransom by Islamist racists who are intent on converting us to their way of life is an indication of the extent to which we have sunk because we have done so without attempting to fight back. We have allowed ourselves to be subjugated by laws dictated by foreign interests with no regard or thought to what the average Briton thinks only that we will do as we are told by outside interests who are only intent on taking over our country. The establishment (and who can forget Andrew Marr’s comments, former head of the BBC) has quietly converted the mechanisms of government to do their own bidding and by that I mean the police as well as the politicians, local governments and the main stream media.

If justice were simply about justice, we would not have to ask this question. Unfortunately, justice also entails individual prejudices from jurors, judges and sometimes even prosecutors as well as pointed antagonism from defense attorneys intent on blaming the victim, not seeking justice. When juries deliberate about a rape conviction or when normal people see news stories about rape and sexual assault, they inevitably ask the inappropriate victim-blaming questions of “why was she alone with him?”; “what was she wearing?”; “what did she do to provoke him?”, etc. The misconception that these factors should come into consideration of a rapist’s guilt only serve to further injustice and silence future survivors who hope to speak out against their attackers and abusers.

Given all of this, I would make a few recommendations. One is the addition of a simple reference list of stages in encounters and combat, and at least one example of a simple combat and one example of a whole multi-character encounter. Use of maps when exploring could also be described at some point in the file, and maps with or without miniatures may be useful when it comes to keeping track of larger combats.

In addition, you will find more Favorites from outside Massachusetts as I traveled a good deal this past year. I hope you enjoy all of these recommendations.

Another things is that, you might have not receive enough love, affections, care, tenderness or provisions from parents or authority figures during your childhood, or they didn’t speak enough into your live to build you up, Eg: You are precious, you have potential, you are worthy, you can do it, you are able, you can be a great blessings to our community or people around you in one way or another, though we all have different gifts, personalities and ways of things we do, and another like “you are unique”, ‘you are unconditionally loved”, “I love you”, “you are handsome/ beautiful”, “you are beautiful”, “you are such a blessing to us”.

Hi 'yall! Whew...I'm so happy to be sitting here in my craft room chatting with you. It's been a long day. I worked today, gave a presentation, came home to the kiddos as my husband walked out the door for work, made and cleaned up dinner, played with the kids, gave the baths and got everyone tucked in bed. Mommy's ready for a break. Looking forward to spending some girl time at Archivers this weekend!

We're a city of bridges, in fact, and the children of Woodland Park cross several of them every day just in the course of their business. They might not know them by name, but they know them. Within five minutes of our front door there's also the Ballard Bridge, the University Bridge, both draw bridges, and the span of the I-5, not to mention the dozen of smaller passovers that connect our neighborhoods together. And then there are the two major floating bridges across Lake Washington connecting us to the Eastside. We live under them and over them, forever passing from one side to the other.

Liesl continued. “I had no idea what Dr. Devoe was talking about.” She steadied herself. “When we walked out of the hotel that night, the snow was blowing hard, but we kept going.

Before I serve up my opinions on food, allow me a caveat. This blog is all about healthy women, healthy body image, healthy confidence and healthy sexuality. Eating is part of this.

"To those who have ever known sound, true silence can be but a myth. It is a phantasm, and something to be feared, for in silence we are vulnerable to our own conscience and its persistent echoes of memory, desire and confusion; we lose the means of dismissal and voluntary ignorance and become vulnerable. In silence we are naked, stripped of the sound layers we have used to define ourselves to outside eyes, a defensive muffling of truths. Today we abjure silence, avoiding its solitude. We are in a constant conversation with an ultra-social and info-overdosed humanity repeatedly relaying sculptures of mundane phrases that numb us to the experience of meaning. We dare not lie still enough to stir or coax the phantom film reels of our past from their shadows. Instead we light fires, shouting and stamping our feet to drive back the dark and its inhabitants. It is our fear of the silence of the void, the vacuum. Humanity cannot see nothingness but we run from it, choking the subtle sound of our own breathing with the bustling of contemporary life where everything is virtual and reality utterly abandoned. We convince ourselves we grow by sponging up the noises of the clattering world that engulfs us. In silence we are trapped as we are made to face the cold starkness of what we feel is missing, or the fierce jab of what we long to erase. We stand in silence and we stand in a room of mirrors. A ticking clock is a heartbeat.

You are claiming the totality of yourself. You are reintegrating your higher inter-dimensional self, and that, sweet angel, is part and parcel of Ascension. That, in itself, is you transitioning to the higher dimensions, at which point you have access to other realities, other dimensions. You are anchoring it, and you are having an experience reaching down and seeing or feeling your third-dimensional self exhibiting in the third dimension — which, to tell you the truth, there is only a sliver left of.
Despite that, the film remains steadfastly objective sharing the statistical facts and illustrating the subjects’ existence.

Not necessarily. Simple selfishness is a pretty good motivator for the love of liberty. Advocating liberty for all is probably the best way of getting liberty for oneself. So the idea that the conservative is basically someone who just wants to be left alone to get on with his own life is perfectly reasonable, defensible and historically well-founded. And I think I could quite well leave my discussion of conservative psychology at that. Nonetheless, there have been various proposals from conservative and other thinkers about a deeper level of motivation among conservatives so on at least some occasions, the love of liberty may have more complex origins than simple selfishness. Perhaps we could put it another way by asking what are the psychological characteristics of people who just want to be left alone to get on with their own lives? Why are they like that? That conservatives are happier than Leftists we have any number of surveys to attest but enquiry never ceases so even that observation leads on to a query about WHY they are happier. Being a psychologist, I certainly like to explore such questions so I want to go on now to a quick look at the various proposals about the fundamental roots of conservatism.

As the song goes, “I’m as corny as Kansas in August… .” And I proudly admit it. The end of the summer most assuredly sets my mind on certain culinary treats – and fresh corn is definitely one of them. Oh, there are bushels of it available throughout the summer, to be sure. However, this time of year offers the last chance to sample the local harvest and that makes it all the more sweet. So off I drive to suburban and yes, rural areas surrounding New York City in search of those golden kernels on the cob.
I have decided to make tuesday my flower of the week day. My flowers are starting to pop out one by one and on a sunny day they are beautiful. This is my Bleeding Heart. It used to be in a big pot in the corner of the patio. But as pots do, it got brittle and broke. So a year or so ago my hubby planted it in the ground. Now I have at least 5 of them. I love this flower but it only lasts until it gets hot and then it wilts away. But as you can see there is a baby fern to the left of it that will get bigger and in the center of it, there is some flower that I dont know what it is but it will be a surprise.

First, consciousness cannot be observed in the way that material objects can. It cannot be weighed, measured, or otherwise pinned down. Second, science has sought to arrive at universal objective truths that are independent of any particular observer’s viewpoint or state of mind. To this end they have deliberately avoided subjective considerations. And third, there seemed no need to consider it; the functioning of the universe could be explained without having to explore the troublesome subject of consciousness.

My students each have a pencil cave on their desk. I ask them to keep two pencils in good operating condition in their cave at all times. They may also keep a pair of scissors and a highlighter in their cave. I take old toilet paper tubes and cover them with a color of paper appropriate for the season. Their names are written on their cave and then attached by taping it to the top of their desk with wide packaging tape. They love their caves and sometimes find messages or treats in them. This month each cave was covered with a different patterned green paper. That has allowed me to easily group children for instruction. The striped cave dwellers might start the rotation by writing. The polka dotted dwellers may start by going to the listening center, and the plaid group may start by reading with me on the rug (rug readers!) After a predetermined time has passed they all switch stations.

There has been a pervading sense of doom around Selhurst Park of late and even having spent years being continually relegated from the Premier League and surviving a stint in receivership and employing ruthless, money grabbing managers, who bolt with the cash as soon as there is any sign of trouble and the annual migration of all talent to larger London clubs, where their young butts will warm benches for a couple of seasons before murdering their brief careers in Portsmouth – This season holds a sense of even more forboding.

I love this time of year...when the weather is beautiful and we all remember why we live in AZ...we went to the lake today and BBQ'd. Holden and I sat by the water and read books while Maya swam and Doug got the coals ready to cook the food :) We thoroughly enjoyed spending time together as a family (it has been a while). We were joined by Grandma Nevie and Grandpa Dwayne, it was fun to be with them and listen to stories of "the old days." We missed Zoe, but look forward to seeing her soonish.

Yet stepping away – the title of this blog’s first ever piece – takes courage and involves being counter-cultural in an environment where to be different inherently involves challenging the carefully crafted comforts and justifications of a consumerist world. The thing is, our landscape didn’t happen by chance. It was intentionally designed to feed the entitled yet never actually satisfy our innermost desires.

Mrs Ting turns out to be the families constant adversary. She has many enemies and is endlessly vindictive. I think most people have their Mrs Ting but in Communist China this Mrs Ting was powerful. As Mao and Mrs Mao plotted and twisted in Beijing, turning against former allies and plotting anarchy as a way to divide and weaken enemies, so Mrs Ting and her husband plotted and conspired too. The advent of the Red Guards (of which Jung Chang was one), which victimised isolated people like teachers and artists, was the start of the Cultural Revolution. Then came the Rebels who were encouraged to attack the officials of the party, and then these rebels became factions fighting each other. Everyone had a side, and everyone could be attacked. There were new political campaigns and Jung Chang's parents had to endure months of meetings in which they would be verbally and physically attacked, eventually being detained and then sent to the countryside in conditions close to a gulag. Somewhere along the way the father has to burn his precious books, and this scene, and a scene where he eventually glimpses the mother after two years are the most touching in the book.

Did one character stand out the most to you? That’s a hard one to answer because I’m the author. They ALL stand out to me or else they wouldn’t have made the cut. It’s more interesting for me to see which character(s) my readers attach to the most and why. But, if forced to choose, probably Nap, since he’s the main character. But all of them, at one point or another, impressed upon me their need to be “in” the book and stay in the book. Even the ones I killed off.

In 1985 we got our first microwave and it opened up a whole new world of convenience food for me. Microwave meals were pretty darn cool back then (well we didn't know better) and I loved these single serving Chicken a la King frozen meals my mother would buy for me to eat after school. I would pop it into the microwave and simply pour the creamy chicken and vegetables over some buttered toast and it tasted beyond wonderful. I have not had chicken a la King in decades but I recently thought about it and it gave me a major craving to taste that creamy chicken over toast again. I created this one pot dish from stove to oven and it was way better than any of those frozen entrees from back in the day. It was simply scrumptious and it came together so easily. I poached my own chicken and made some stock while doing it, but you can easily make this with rotisserie chicken and some canned chicken broth. I did take help from the store with some store bought biscuits from Pillsbury and served it right out my caste iron skillet. I scored another 10 fingers up (my kid's way of saying lots of thumbs up) and my husband tried really hard not to have 3rd helpings. I will definitely not wait decades to eat Chicken a la King again. Actually, I've got it schedule for dinner again next week.

A friend of the family is an avid collector of kitchenalia and other products from the 50s and my brother collects a lot of 60s kitchenalia as well, so I’ve always been around it. I also studied graphic design and loved pouring through books showing 60s product design and advertising.

But the following fall I entered high school and all would change. I improved my playing, but at the same time, it was clear that the clarinet was decidedly not a sexy instrument. We were listening to "Eight Days a Week" and "White Rabbit" on our .45 rpm records. Moving to saxophone was an option, but really, anyone who was "boss", "bitchin'", or "cool" was studying guitar.

IF Downfall is an accurate account. McCombes must then answer a serious question: if Sheridan was merely a fame-seeking, empty suit with no political talent other than the ability to dazzle the unwary, why then did the author and his party “plaster Tommy’s face and name on countless millions of leaflets and hundreds of thousands of posters” and “inflate Tommy’s abilities and exaggerate his role”?
And so I hope my wandering mind is calming down for the night and a good night’s sleep now that I’ve typed it out of my head. One more thing I will mention, though, and that is that my grandson DW moved to a new apartment today. He had stayed with me for the past two weeks while he awaited his “moving-in” day. A couple of weeks doesn’t sound like enough time to get settled in and I doubt that it was for him, but I became accustomed to having him here and I miss him. I guess I’ll set the alarm tonight since he’s not here to accidentally set it off. He was three years old in this photo. That was twenty years ago.

“East” refers to the dawn, sunrise, morning. Hence if pagans wished to worship a goddess of sunrise, it was fitting for the pagans to name their goddess after the word “east”. But Christians also had reason to use the word “east” to describe the day of their Savior’s resurrection. Consider the following passages concerning Christ’s resurrection:

Earlier in the year, I was scanning each test and putting it into my Evernote note that I keep for the student (these notes are for my records and especially for writing comments (which we do at least 3 times per year for each student); I never share the note with the student or anyone else). I liked being able to scroll through all of their quizzes, but I didn’t like that the large images buried any text (the comments) that I put into their note.
For the past seven years, psychologist Mary “Moody” Sinclair had been used to the moist cool air of the coastal town of Winnington Bay, Washington. The dry desert air of Rubicon Ranch sucked the moisture out and left her feeling like she was breathing in tiny sand particles.

In terms of money, if one truly wishes to start a family but the amount of money isn’t sufficient, then make sacrifices. I’m not saying no food/drinks/living on scraps. I’m saying sacrifice overseas trips, cut down on expensive restaurant foods and such. Oh, and don’t buy more than what you need. Splurging once in awhile is ok, but don’t overdo it.

Oh, another remake. And I'm not for sure on how I feel about this one yet. It was fairly well-made, and James Marsden didn't bother as much as he usually does so that's a plus. But they break away from the main storyline too much and dwells on that Jeremy dude who apparently is some kind of pedophile but it's never explained. Speaking of that, the rape scene here is just as confusing as it was in the original. I feel horrible saying this, but in both films it looks like a half-rape half-sex scene between Amy and Charlie like she sorta wants to do it but doesn't at the same time. Not very feminist of me, but you can't deny that this scene is a little weird because I can't tell if she's giving in out of fear of more physical pain or because there's still some feelings there for Charlie. Anyway. One thing this movie does wrong is the end battle where some of the killings are too stylized and not realistic at all - the nail gun and the bear trap, mostly. Also, the movie takes too long to get to the exciting parts and has too many characters, when the story should have centered more on David and Amy and the hooligans.
Princesses are also exclusively privileged, perfectly proportioned, and have plenty of things. So, are we also teaching our girls to be snotty, obsessed with their looks and materialistic? Or, are we over-thinking it?
Then, in a fit of whimsy over one two-week period, I found “The Enterprise Job” on that forgotten sector of my hard drive. Now that the world of electronic and independent publishing has exploded, I decided that perhaps this was a means of putting stories like this in front of people, having a little fun, and…yes…perhaps making a little extra scratch to support my growing vodka habit.
If you want to turn these into a burrito, I’ve done that by making some rice and once it’s done mixing in coconut oil to make it nice and flavorful. You can add peppers, onions, and other veggies in with the sweet potatoes if you’d like!

Our population growth and our average life expectancy in fact showed us Africans in South Africa to be in better than average health when compared to other Africans on the rest of the continent: in the decades prior to the official policy of apartheid,(which was started in 1948), the average life expectancy of African South Africans was only 38 years.
5. Treatment of monuments: I saw this kid kicking a ball into the Confucious temple in Chiayi. The grandpa was nearby, but didn't feel it's inappropriate to behave this way. The ball was dirty and and I saw some black marks left on the temple. I observed many times, that monuments of historic or religious value were not treated well, touching and climbing is quite common, especially when kids are around.

The best part of summer is what happens in the moments when nothing is planned and no one cares about schedules or dates, when an idea changes from a word to an action, even if that action involves nothing more than a nap in the hammock under the apricot tree, listening to the wind chimes tinkle in a hot Eastern Washington breeze.
I showed the second concept to my group and professor and everyone loved it but there was a problem.

Anyway, Madison has this thing now about not going home. If we’re out, she wants to stay out. Whenever she gets the feeling our stop – at a restaurant, store, mall, etc. – is winding down, she’ll ask “What are we doing after this?” Before Lynnette and I can answer, she’ll say “I want to go somewhere place else.” Sometimes she offers suggestions as to where this “somewhere place else ” is, but usually she does not.

I was at the place my family usually vacations in the summer. I’m hesitant to name it, so I’ll just say that it’s a really cute town with vacation houses for rent and an old fashioned candy/soda place. In the middle of it is a little lake. In this dream, I was in one of the houses my family has rented in the past. It has a pool table and an air hockey game upstairs. I looked for my family, but I couldn’t find anyone so I decided to play pool until someone found me. I think this dream consisted of a game of pool for at least a third its duration, but I digress.

As we travel and teach around the globe, many people ask us, “How can I find a qualified meditation teacher?” The answer is not always an easy one. When we first began our own practice, there were three meditation centers in Seattle and two yoga teachers. Now, there are thousands of yoga and meditation teachers and hundreds of meditation centers! In looking for a spiritual or “mind fitness” teacher, the qualities to look for include compassion, knowledge and insight, morality, sincerity and skill — both in teaching and in their way of living — and a greater realization of their true nature and highest potentials than you have. From your own side, you should have confidence in your teacher and be able to communicate well with him or her. However, don’t set out on a frantic guru hunt! We encourage you to proceed slowly, mindfully, and to be both open-minded and very discerning. It may be a matter of years before you meet the person who can answer your questions and be this special spiritual friend and teacher for you.
That’s right. He has a bunch of awful speeches in this thing that, aside from his cool voice, are the screenwriting equivalent to jerking himself off. Every single one of these things is the same: “I’m going to show you pain you never imagined. I will open up the hell dimension and make you all suffer. Your suffering is going to be beautiful, so beautiful it could win a beauty pageant.” Well, maybe not the last part.

When I tell people I home educate, often the response is 'Wow, you're brave' or 'That must be hard work' or 'I could never do that'. And what I want to say in reply (but rarely do) is that educating my kids (or facilitating their learning, which is more our style), is actually the easy bit. It's all the other stuff that is hard.

At the hospital I saw a doctor who check my blood pressure, my urine, my swelling, and my weight, then deemed it, drum roll please, edema! After looking in my chart he ask would I like to have this baby today. I thought he was humoring me so I said that would be great! He said something like, "Let's check your progress" and so now I was laying flat on my back naked from the waist down because of swollen feet. I was 4cm (as I had been for a few weeks), 50% effaced, -2 station. I can't really tell you why I remember all of that, but I do. He asked if I wanted to be induced and because I'd just read in my trusty "What to Expect When Your Expecting" book that induction entailed drugs, I said no thanks. Then things got weird. For the first time in all my vaginal exams I felt pain. It wasn't super intense, just painful compared to all other vaginal exams and by far more uncomfortable. So just like that, my membranes were stripped. No informed consent, no permission to do so, he didn't even tell me what he'd done. I had to find that out later. Also, for the record, I wasn't "due" until October 5th.

But even then, the boy was troubled. Why him? Was it right that chance blessed one boy with health and left another crippled? The question gnawed at Douglas, and when he became governor of Saskatchewan in 1944, he instituted a hybrid form of the single payer model in which the government served as insurer while providers remained private. By 1961, every province and territory in Canada had adopted Saskatchewan's model. The Republic of Korea and Taiwan later followed suit, and in 1965, the U. S. Congress adopted the name of Douglas' model for the legislation that established Medicare. In 2004, a national poll named Tommy Douglas as the "greatest Canadian of all time."

What a busy week it has been! On Monday and Tuesday I took our daughter to All County Chorus practice from 8:15 - 1:15 (I dropped her off). Her music teacher from school was there to supervise (there were 3 from her school and about 200 5th grade students in all). Tuesday night she had her performance. I also had a board meeting from 4:15 - 5:30pm on Tuesday so it was the mad dash to get everyone where they needed to be. My husband also had an elder board meeting that night so he came to the performance and then went straight to the meeting (he was late with everyone's blessing - family first!). Our eldest son had an IB Extended Essay Abstract reading that same night, so he went there and our middle son skipped his Boy Scout meeting to go support his big brother.

Four Brothers holds up relatively well compared to most other revenge movies. The plot is intricate enough to keep the viewer guessing, and there is plenty of action to keep things interesting, including a cool chase scene on icy roads that ends in a lot of mayhem. Also, this being a Marky Mark movie, there is the obligatory fist fight in which some poor idiot gets his face bashed in. It's gritty, entertaining, and ultimately satisfying.

Well, that’s a topic for another day. Pencils. I came to the decision that there are criteria for my use of one over the other. I adore pencils (Focus, padawan.) for their aged qualities. The scent of a freshly-sharpened pencil is pure heaven and there is nothing akin to the feeling of utter joy when facing a single, blank sheet of paper with only a #2 pencil in hand. You sighed just now, didn’t you? I know I did.
God Loves Broken People isn't exactly revolutionary, but it's sound and reassuring advice to people who are suffering, enduring trials or disappointments, or are still recovering from past difficulties. The crux of the message is one I've sought out and preached to myself for years now: that the hard things God allows into our lives are never meaningless or arbitrary. Suffering doesn't mean that He doesn't love us, or has abandoned us. He uses our pain to show us His love and provision, help us to grow, and make us more fit for service. Sheila Walsh elaborates on this theme through Scripture, true-life stories, and her own experience.

I decided to have a go at making a flower from lace (I've got a huge box of lace that needs using), and I don't think it turned out too badly for a first attempt. The fancy button in the centre is from a huge box of buttons that were given to me by my mum's hubby - they were his mum's collection, she was a bit of a hoarder so there's loads of them! It started out gold and I painted it with some acrylic paint (bought in many colours and then never used), dabbed on some distress ink and sprayed it with iridescent spray & sparkle. Added some more lace and some more of that fancy trim from the offcuts bag, a punched butterfly and a Pink Petticoat sentiment.
Outside the Perak State Assembly, the police arrested more than 40 people, including Pakatan Rakyat legislators, bystanders, and people drinking tea and eating breakfast at a mamak stall.

Perhaps he was eating heroin and drinking ganja tea.
I don’t know. And to be honest—I don’t care. Yes, it’s not perfect. Some mission tasks I’ve completed whilst just wandering the wilderness, before said missions were active, (killing the Hagraven, Petra for example) and when I try to complete them they remain as incomplete in my mission tab. A niggling glitch, but one I’m prepared to live with. Perhaps the next instalment will feature an option to father children; to train them, and pass onto them skills as my avatar grows old and incapable of swinging a Daedric axe with sufficient force to incapacitate a foe, or my eyesight too poor to score a headshot with an arrow, my mind too forgetful to remember enchantments. If I’ve learnt anything from my time playing this game, it’s that anything’s possible for the next instalment.
Rasterbator (BoxNet download) is the easiest of them all. Works just like Block Posters but you can change the colour of the dots and use more trial and error to get the image the way you want it.

5. Any Job Is A Good Job –There is no such thing as underemployment if you don’t have a job. No job is beneath you if you’re unemployed. Every day you don’t put money in the bank, you’re unnecessarily lowering your water line. It may not be much fun selling shoes with your freshly minted law degree in hand, but it’s a start – it’s a step in the right direction. The most important life skill you can develop is leadership ability. You don’t have to be in charge to lead – you can lead in any capacity regardless of the position you hold.

Sometimes things happen and we are not very sure how to deal with them. One of these things may be that we are going through a personal problem like a divorce. This is a time when there are so many emotions going on and you are not sure what is going on in some cases. There are many feelings that you may be hiding deep inside and you are looking for a way to release them. When this is the problem, you may want to consider writing a journal to take care of the issues.

When he was a young man, Randy Lopez left his village in northern New Mexico to seek his fortune. Since then, he has learned some of the secrets of success in the Anglo world and even written a book called Life Among the Gringos. But something has been missing. Now he returns to Agua Bendita to reconnect with his past and to find the wisdom the Anglo world has not provided. In this allegorical account of Randy s final journey, master storyteller Rudolfo Anaya tackles life s big questions with a light touch.

But a tip of the hat and flip of the melodramatic cape goes to the alien leader, the most memorably broad performance in the whole movie, one John "Bunny" Breckinridge. With high-handed flourishes, occasional glimpses at his script, eye rolls aplenty and a tone of haughty insouciance that seems to hint at the fact that everyone else in this film is effectively hiding: this is all a bunch of ridiculously cheap nonsense nobody could possibly take it seriously.

It’s in the last graf of Janie’s article, though, that I found what I was interested in. It was bound up in a quote from ASU scholar (and former Corporation Commissioner) Kris Mayes. She said that the conference is a good opportunity for anyone interested in practicing in renewable energy law. “When solar energy takes off, this will become a significant practice area for a lot of attorneys in Arizona and other states in the Southwest,” she said.

Weddings are always sweet and loving. What’s more sweet than having matching bride and groom cookies? I made these cookies for a bride as a surprise. When she saw the cookies, she couldn’t believe her eyes and said “that’s so beautiful and the cookie matches my dress.” I just couldn’t believe these cookies can make someone so happy.
Momma: She had a rough day all the way around. She did not want to get up this morning, and told me she “felt like $hit”. I took her temp and everything looked good. When I returned this afternoon, she was a little shaggy tailed. She talked for a bit, I changed her pants, and then well…I don’t know what the heck happened other than Parkinson’s, because she was straight up that way. Joyce stated to me she had never seen Momma this bad. Well, I have. Momma has had quite a few good days in a row, so I figured we were due. We finally got Momma to bed (I think I taught, Joyce a couple of tricks tonite as far as Momma is concerned). Momma arrived in the bed, and FINALLY relaxed.
My biggest disappointment with the story comes two-thirds of the way through when we find out exactly what's going on, and it turns out to have a rational (if convoluted) explanation. Such a Radcliffian twist seems out of place in a story with a Goblin who eats books. Nonetheless, I pushed through to the end, partly due to the fact that the book's only 180 pages, and partly to see how Nomura would fill the remaining pages after the main mystery was resolved. I'm glad I did, for after a brief lull the story picks up again with a twist that makes up for the main plot fizzling out.

Viking design emphasized intertwining, sinuous shapes, usually detailing animals and often including people. The Vikings often incorporated legend into their art. The stave churches are a particularly valuable part of the Norwegian architectural heritage, and are considered to be of national and global importance. There are several types of stave churches but the common element to all of them is that they have corner-posts (“staves”) and a skeleton or framework of timber with wall planks standing on sills. These walls are known as stave walls, hence the name stave church.

"The shell (cylindrical body) is a right circular cylinder formed of three cylindrical courses joined by circumferential welds. Each course, in turn, is made of two semicircular plates joined by longitudinal welds. The longitudinal welds in the three courses were oriented 90 degrees from each other to avoid possible crack propagation." The text continues to indicate that on the top of this cylinder was welded a forged bolting flange (to bolt down the closure head) and that to the bottom was added the lower head, again by welding. The lower head was made from four pie-shaped plates and a central dished or domed section, all welded. The nominal thickness of the lower head is given as 6.2 inches.

I expected a lot from this movie going into it, but I was given so little. It’s difficult to explain, but there seemed to be something very important missing from the plot of this movie that could have made it a million times better. While the backstory for Thor and his Asgardian family was adequate, there was absolutely no backstory given for any of the human characters. This meant that they were largely uninteresting, shallow and basically served as placeholders to fill in an already anemic plot line. I’m not sure if this was recognized when Thor first came out, but the movie seems like it was rushed. It’s as if they simply pushed this movie through production without any effort in making it a quality film because they wanted to have it ready before The Avengers came out. I don’t even think this movie was long enough to substantiate being released in theatres. Maybe they should’ve considered a made-for-TV movie or direct-to-DVD, because it doesn’t seem like the big-budget blockbuster it was made out to be.

I cannot say that the entire book is a disappointment, but it is not the tome I wanted it to be. It features some 100 games and is peppered with personal ‘video games as art’ manifestos from people whose credentials are not even identified. Perhaps it’s the professional journalist/page designer/art director in me speaking, but I would have organized the book much different, and it would have been much better. But that being said, it includes more games that needed to be there (Okami, Final Fantasy VII, Mass Effect 2, Phantasy Star, Super Mario Bros. 3, Panzer Dragoon Saga, the best Zelda: WInd Waker, Heavy Rain, Earthworm Jim, Fallout,Super Mario 64, Shenmue, Metal Gear Solid, Pitfall!, Shadow of Colossus) than those that shouldn’t have been there (Dune II, Brütal Legend — are you fucking serious? —Worms Armageddon, StarFox: Assault, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell — shoot me now — Fable, Halo 2, Metal Gear Solid 2).
Every Andhra soul would have tasted this quintessential street food at least once in their life time. Unlike Chat vendors who have different types of chat on the same cart, these vendors dedicate their carts exclusively to these fritters. My Dad used to bring these home while coming from work, wrapped in a crumpled old newspaper with some onions sprinkled over 4 or 6 Bajjis. As a kid, I never thought much of them, honestly. I craved for the Pav Bhajis and the Gol Gappas more. And, I never understood the yum factor in these until I moved out and came to the States. If I crave these now, the best you can get here are what are called the Cut Mirchi with some masala stuffed in and cut in two. But, the authenticity and the simplicity of the bandiwallahs' fritters are simply lost.

This morning in church Riley was quick and slid under the pew in front of me before I could stop him. The two older couples were quick to smile at him and welcomed Riley to sit with them. I'm always a bit taken back when Riley so naturally makes himself part of another family sitting near us that we don't know. He just smiles at them and somehow draws them in as if it was as natural as can be that he is suddenly part of their family. I've given up trying to slow him down and really wonder at times if this isn't how we all should be. Really if we were all as quick as Riley to smile and cuddle up next to the stranger sitting in front of us we wouldn't be strangers for long. This morning after mass as I was apologizing for Riley crawling under the pew the women stops me and says "oh don't be sorry it was great. I miss my own granddaughter and I enjoyed him sitting with us". Once again Riley shared a little love and sunshine.

Holmes argues that in meeting the power at work in Christ, one encounters God’s knowing and willing – the grain of the universe, to use a phrase popularised by Hauerwas. Power, Holmes insists, is never to be isolated from a determination – namely, that of peace with God himself. It is precisely this determination which is the reality-indication ingredient in the person of Christ. What Scripture testifies to is that this determination is an omnipotent determination which withstands the world’s rebellion. So Holmes:

Microsoft claims they own over 80% of the global browser market share - but that takes into account the market as a whole. This view is skewed because when you dig deeper you find all technology marketing managers actually split the market up using Diffusion of Innovation Theory. This split is seen as five technology adopter categories - innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. If you look at each market individually, the claimed 80% market share is probably split very differently; my guess the IE market share being weighted greater than 90% for the Early/Late Majority, and less than 40% to the Innovators/Early Adopters.

I took a deep breath and looked around to decide where I would begin this mammoth job. There is a piece of trim hanging from the ceiling that needs to be replaced. It has bothered me forever and was marked as water damaged wood when we moved in. So, this weekend, I decided I would replace it, prime it and begin the painting process. I climbed up the stepladder in order to detach the piece of trim and what I found was water damage. As I tugged on the wood, I realized it had come loose because there was nothing for it to grip to. The wood underneath had rotted causing the trim to hang down. Being the curious one, I started removing the rest of the fascia so I could see the extent of the damage. What I found were several pieces of wood in one area with water damage. They had begun to rot away.

This is really a chance at the local level to find every creative way we have to say “hey, federal legislators, if you all will actually step up and do what we know you know is right in the first place, you will not be punished for it.” And that’s why I’m actually really happy to be doing work at the local level because I literally think this is more important than talking to members of Congress right now, because they all know — they’ve all read all the position papers, they’ve read all the outcry, what they don’t know is whether they’re safe to do what is right. “

She said, "you must not have absorbed what you were reading then." But I did! Oh, I did. It was a book about the Great Depression, and I remember just being fascinated by the time period. I actually can still recall details from it, and I couldn't have been more than 12 at the time.

Mimi Alford should be just ever so slightly embarrassed to write a book about an affair she had with President Kennedy, if only for the fact that any woman he was involved with must have been held in bas relief as a very distant second -- or third, or fourth -- to the gracious Jacqueline Kennedy. What woman would even want to admit to that?
As I’ve mentioned, I keep feeling like I want to let one of my bosses know about my issues. Not because I think everyone should know about it, but I feel like I’m burdened with keeping a secret. Like I have to always be on guard to keep something from slipping out.

Mr Sheridan asked Mr Wight about the “blue book” which was found by police in Mr Whittamore’s home. This book listed, according to Mr Sheridan, requests for “illegal services” by various journalists. There was then a discussion as to whether Mr Wight’s name was in the book 17 times or 70 times. Mr Sheridan referred Mr Wight to a “league table” of users of Mr Whittamore’s services. Mr Wight stated that the News of the World was not at the top. Mr Sheridan asked if Mr Wight himself was “high on league table”, to which Mr Wight replied that he was “convinced I’m at the lower end of scale“. Mr Sheridan then put it to him that in fact he was third on the list of journalists who used Mr Whittamore. Mr Wight disagreed, saying that this was “preposterous”, as he had checked with the newspaper accounts department previously and there had only been 17 requests of which only 10 were paid.

In 1801, Beethoven confessed to his friends at Bonn his worry of becoming deaf. At Heiligenstadt, in 1802, he wrote a famous text which expressed his disgust at the unfairness of life, that he, a musician, could become deaf was something he did not want to live through. But, music made him carry on and he wrote that he knew that he still had many other musical domains to explore, to discover, and to pass on. Beethoven did not commit suicide, rather, knowing that his handicap was getting worse and worse. He threw himself into his greatest Beethoven music; Sonatas for Piano (notably The Storm, Opus 31), the second and the third symphonies – The Eroica and of course many more.

OK, not really, they use it because it works. It’s emotional shorthand. And while you can say its just a cliché, its a cliché that works. Because it’s universal. All of us have parents. Most of us know who they are. Issues with parents are things some people never work out. And when children become parents, it’s a chance to look at the whole thing from the other side. Kind of like starting over from a taller viewpoint.

After a few days of being there Rylee started to feel much better. The docs finally thought, after ALL her UTIs, that cathing her would be beneficial. She I was taught how to do and we did it every 3 hours. It was tough having to get used to a totally new schedule. It was well worth it because Rylee really started to feel better.

I also discovered I can make chocolate chip cookies and not eat one single bite of the dough. Who knew I had will power? In addition, I discovered that now that I am an adult, with a more developed palate, I like the colored bell peppers. Still not a huge fan of the green ones, but red, yellow and orange are pretty good. Especially grilled with some onions. We’ll definitely be adding them to our regular diet. But can anyone explain why the colored peppers are so much more expensive than plain old green ones?!

Sometimes, after a busy week at work trying to cook from scratch can just be a step too far. So I thought I would share with you a recipe I have been tweaking for years, it was a regular weeknight supper when I worked full time and my sons were both at school. Sometimes when they both appear home for supper I will still make it, there is something so comforting about food from your childhood!

Designing is one of my passions. I come from a long line of crafters. My grandmother, mom, and three sisters all love crafting. Even as a young girl I was exposed to many types of products and styles. They have helped to form my passion. Getting to design as a "job" is wonderful. It is exciting to wake up and start designing.

I think it's time we all got real about what is happening here and stop promising to make future apologies for military actions against our people when we all know it will continue. It is no longer other distant countries we can point to and sit in judgment over how their militaries treat their citizens. It's time to put the focus back on our own country and stop the war against our people once and for all.

And what the hell was with the comment about how he had been planning on missing the flight? Um, pretty easy to do. Just don’t go to the airport, dumbass. Well, we got to talking to the couple that were timing him, and it turned out he’d been asking the wife if she knew how many people the plane would hold. And he’d been mumbling something to himself for quite a while before we’d sat down across from him, I guess.
Sunday was not really a marathon, it was like three 10 km runs back to back to back. In the early morning it was marvellous to gather with a group of about 80 believers and I was privileged to share a message from Mark 2. Then right after lunch we did it again with a different group–this one was about 50 people. Scott Campbell provided simultaneous translation as my french isn’t strong enough to carry more than a conversation. Then in the late afternoon we celebrated with our Filipino church here with a study from the life of Barnabas, a man of encouragement. The people encouraged me as I encouraged them!

guess the writers couldn’t cash in on the phenomenon of The Vampire Diaries. Apparently, the same formula doesn’t work twice. The pilot had promise, but the moment they killed off Nick and replaced him with his brother, I was thinking, “They jumped the shark on that one.” And so early too. *shakes head in dismay* Something happened to the writing along the way. The first few episodes where so tight. I don’t know where exactly the show began to unravel at the seams, but I would have wanted another season, just to see what happens with the four witches seen at the end of the finale. Grrr!

If Dad already has a widescreen TV, well, what’s dazzling Video without astounding audio? Pick out a home theater! For small rooms, a home-theater-in-a-box — a package containing the amplifier, tuner and speakers — is enough but not too much. For Dads who never shout, “Turn your stereo down!” go with surround sound speakers — a multi-speaker system identified by number: 5.1, 6.1 or 7.1; the “.1″ is the subwoofer (the deep notes); the other number is how many speakers are in the group. Spread them around the room and they’ll reproduce theater-quality audio.
I, on the other hand, have had children in hospitals, have had surgeries in hospitals, and gone into the hospital for days at a time because of pesky pneumonia or this or that.

He more or less blunders aboard the Knight Bus, driven and operated by working class wizards and a wizard’s artifact that Muggles don’t notice, and pays a fare for the trip to London. He gives his name as Neville Longbottom, apparently out of worry that there’s an arrest warrant out under his own name. While on the bus, he learns more about Sirius Black, the escaped prisoner, who turns out to be a dangerous wizard and an old supporter of ‘You-Know-Who.’ The Ministry of Magic had to alert the Muggles to the fact that he was out there, but didn’t give the whole story, of course.
5 out of 5 – Violence – Considering that the book is composed mostly of warfare during the village’s besiege, that explains why not only does this segment receive a large number, but also why this book holds the biggest death count of the Bone ennealogy (series of nine works). Most of the book pays attention to the war, not even bothering to add words, in examples like Gran’ma smacking a rat creature with a long stick. After their trek to the dragon grounds, Fone Bone & Thorn accidentally awaken the dragons, causing them to erupt from beneath the village ground. The mythical story of the dragon queen Mim is told, and we see her burn down in flames in what is one of the most upsetting scenes in the book. In several illustrations, you can see dead bodies of both man and rat scattered about the grounds. (WARNING: The spoilers are about to come in! I am really spoiling it!) Thorn is attacked & trapped by Kingdok when he bites into her leg and prevents her from touching the Crown. She then proceeds to use a sword to go through his skull, killing him once and for all. Briar attacks her own sister (again, Gran’ma Ben) with her scythe, and she is stopped by Lucius from truly killing her. As soon as Fone Bone successfully touches the Crown, Briar’s body bursts in an energy supernova, killing both her and Lucius, ending the war. A few pages later, you can see her body burnt to an ashy crisp. Before this, Briar apparently kills a great number of people during the war, including the Vedu leader Tarsil. The same guy unmasks himself before he goes, revealing a gnarly scar that nearly runs across his face. Fone Bone & Thorn apparently got socked before the events of the book, so Fone has a swollen-shut eye for almost the entire book.

Lipper FMI reports that fixed income received another $1.8 billion. This is the 26th consecutive weekly inflow for the asset class but it is a bit light compared to previous weeks. But the corporate high yield sector which actually is correlated with the equity market saw a net withdrawals of $1.3 billion for the week. This is the largest weekly redemption since May 2010 (when the sector lost $1.7 billion). According to the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II index, junk bonds were priced at 102.2 yielding 7.31% – 565 basis points above Treasury bills.

Around about the time I’m slowing down to look for the house we are headed to, I crack my window for some fresh air, and to help with the window fog. I hear frogs. Lots of them. The high thrill that comes from a frogs throat when they have awakened from hibernation, and are looking for another frog to um…have a couple fly martinis with. And it clicked. Frogs. I am smushing frogs. Everyone has been smushing frogs all evening.

The last meeting was the evening after I wrote my post about "remembering NICU" and I was talking with one of the mums there about it all. This mum has four kids - she had two healthy kids, then in her delivery with her twins, her son suffered a brain injury during the delivery and ended up with cerebral palsy. He is now six and although he is cognitive (ie, he can think, hear, see, everything like that), he is basically unable to control his body. He cannot speak, except for with the use of a computer he controls with his eyes, he cannot walk...

In this snippet Sora my heroine is swearing her oath to Helix. Taking her place as leader Sora has to accept this position from her murderous uncle Cerny. This piece is a little rough, a first draft. I spent a lot of time making a brand new first chapter to replace the all tell and no show first chapter I did have. After that of course I needed to redo the rest I had already written.

Plant green beans in well drained soil and full sun after the soil has warmed up in the spring. They can be planted in rows or squares, but should be space 3-4 inches apart and one inch deep. Maintain even moisture and watch for pests like beetles or slugs. (I have observed that the slugs in my garden have a liking for my purple green beans and are not willing to share if given the chance to populate.) Harvest green beans when they are firm and crisp. Be sure to hold onto the plant at the top of the bean when removing in order to prevent ripping off whole branches accidentally.

The main thing to remember about this show is-these people. Never. Stop. It's sunup to sundown activity. In an earlier episode, they went fishing, not with rod and reel, but to check their salmon nets. After one dry run, they went back the next day and took in a hefty haul. I shivered every time Todd or his partner reached into that frigid water to pull that thing in.
Well I didn't get to finish the last of the Verve Sketches......my 7yr old son and I were involved in a 3 car accident Friday afternoon (our time). Our car had to be towed and we were both taken to hospital in an ambulance. Let me stress that we are both OK and cleared of any major damage, although we are still both stiff and sore this morning and the shock of it has hit home a bit. It wasn't our fault as we were waiting to turn into a side street and had no idea it was coming so we didn't brace ourselves and we were flung forward and back again quite hard. My poor son was screaming that his head was hurting. Thankfully he still wears a full body harness while sitting on a booster seat so he was a protected as we could have him. I thank God that we are OK and that we were not badly hurt and that we had the support of some of the school Mums who saw us and stopped to help - one even cooked us dinner! God is good and sends the support we need!!
Yup...it was a whole book -about 60 pages of pictures and notes - and we went through every damn page of it. When we finished and he had relayed all of his stories to me he remarked about how he knew I'd never hurt him like that.

So what does this news mean for fans of the band? First and foremost it would suggest more touring, particularly in the U.S. and Japan which are markets where the band remains incredibly popular. It also means the band may have finally committed to writing new material as they have now taken the live show of the their two albums as far as they can. It also begs the question: What role will or won't Jerry Dammers play in the future? Stay tuned!

Mr Sheridan asked whether there was a culture of private and confidential cash payments at News of the World. Mr Wight accepted that cash payments were indeed made, but that there was a note of every one paid. Mr Sheridan then referred to the NotW’s “Sheridan Costs” document dated 27 June 2007, consisting of a table of payments, many redacted by the commissioner appointed previously by the court. Mr Sheridan drew Mr Wight to two entries labelled “Private and Confidential cash payment” for £1,000 and £1,500, which Mr Wight was unable to explain, then another two entries with his name against them, one for around £1,600 and the other for £2,173 labelled accommodation. Mr Wight stated these pertained to his three week stay in Scotland around the 2006 trial, and also included Ms McGuire’s expenses, adding that cash payments were very rarely paid in Scotland. Mr Sheridan then drew attention to records of three cash payments from August 2006 totalling £2,500 attached to the “Sheridan Costs” document, with Mr Wight pointing out that these were dated after he had moved to London, and stated these were not evidence of a culture of cash payments.

It is no surprise that the church should have done so much to foster and protect the nascent university system, since the church, according to historian Lowrie Daly, “was the only institution in Europe that showed consistent interest in the preservation and cultivation of knowledge.”
In the end, maybe the idea of accompanying is really a pretty good way to think and talk about the follower's role in tango--as long as we don't get trapped in that knee-jerk reaction I first had, of thinking that accompanying is, by implication, less important than leading.

I’ve never been an enormous Streep fan, but the more of her recent work I see, the more I respect her, and I’m hard-pressed to think of another American film actress who could bring the ambiguities of Sister Aloysius to life. I’m a shameless Hoffman fan, and both he and Adams deserve their Globe nominations (nothing against Viola Davis at all– her one scene is quite devastating, but it is just one scene, and I’m tired of award-granters handing out nominations for such minimal parts). I’m fairly certain that at least two of the three will show up in the Oscar nomination roll call as well. Unfortunately, the film itself is too stilted to really bring anything truly cinematic to the fore – it remains essentially a filmed play, lacking that extra spark to make it a great movie.
Sometimes you get your answer before the question is asked because we know you’re asking it. Sometimes we’re so anxious to give you the answer, so excited that you would even ask, that it comes even before you ask, way before. This is guidance. That’s what to expect. It comes with the territory of a rejuvenation of the planet and this is the year it starts being enhanced. Now, are you going to receive it or throw it away since “you” thought of it?

As the other rider finished her lesson, I started trying to get Oliver round in the way we were working on: Hold the outside rein, squeeze gently on the inside rein and give, use lots of inside leg. Oliver was being very good about listening to the inside leg, which was nice. I was having trouble with my hands though. When the inside hand went to give, the outside hand wanted to do the same so Oliver didn't have anywhere to go, or if we went right, he wanted to go through his outside shoulder, bending at the neck and not the ribcage.
You know the old chesnut; your house is on fire and you can only rescue one object, what would it be? Well, for me it would be this little beauty. The 2004 Trunk soundtrack release of Gerry Anderson's first live-action series, UFO. Set far in the future, 1980.

But what, you might ask, could be such an urgent resolution that it must be completed under such pressing circumstances? Surely it’d have to be something exciting or ambitious or positive or, at the very least, key to the success of the ensuing few months? Well, hm. Not exactly. Not unless you count entitling a document ‘The Last Will and Testament of Lisa Lynch’ as a particularly exhilarating assignment. So, yes.

I, for one, don’t want to spend my work life surrounded by cynics. They drain my energy. They drag me down and suck all the joy out of living. I had an acquaintance (cynics can never be real friends to anyone, including themselves) when I was in college whom we all laughingly referred to as the “black cloud.” He was certain that behind every silver lining, there must be a black cloud. But just ask him to do something about it, to take an active role in solving a problem, to be personally involved and accountable for making a situation better, and watch him run away as fast as he could. He cared just enough to criticize, but never quite enough to make things better.

There are many styles of Lambic. The basic lambic is a cloudy, uncarbonated, bracingly sour beer that is generally about two to three years old. Unlike conventional ales and lagers, which are fermented by carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeasts, Lambic beers are produced by spontaneous fermentation and are exposed to wild yeasts and bacteria such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis (brett) and B. lambicus.
I found another "Voices" album on the stack this morning. In this case, a two record set. Living Voices are yet another guilty pleasure. With one insane exception (Positively 4th Street) the albums are produced as mainstream easy listening. But there always seems to be a gem or two on each record. Usually I'll find a rock/pop song cover that is a tough sell done as easy listening. This album features a few lounge-like vocal tracks. And the luke warm cover of the Strings Theme From Charlie's Angels can't be overlooked.

Liv is a brilliant protagonist. She is intelligent and hardworking, vulnerable without being weak. She had a quirky sense of humour and a quick witted way of thinking and speaking that made me all the more drawn to her.

1. Please don’t hate me, but I’m going for lose 5lbs again. Third time is a charm right? F, I trimmed down the length of the goal this time around for the recapping. But I was going to do the advocare cleanse. I did not do the advocare cleanse. I realized I had not factored in a wedding I would be at during the only Saturday of the month where the cleanse fit. You might be thinking, well, Beth just suck it up and eat clean at the wedding. Have you ever been to Babe’s? If not then think chicken fried steak, fried chicken, etc and that’s what we had. Anyways as to the weight lose…yah, I’m still at the same weight. Oops? At least it’s consistent?

So, this month has been kind of crazy for me with all of the interviews and giveaway planning.
After we spent some time looking for another little Gun shop that a friend told me about and couldn’t find, we called it a day in Prescott and headed for the Ranch....North Ranch. We got home right at 4:00 o’clock.....Happy Hour, of course....but too late to go to the Thursday afternoon Jam session at the Club House. They start playing music about 2 pm and break up at 4, so we just missed it. Darn, I like going to the Jam sessions. We have some great musicians here in the park and up in Wickenburg. Plus there is usually always a few passing through and staying in the RV Park here.
I do not want people to defend their choice of mainstream government schooling to me...I don't care...Nothing anyone could say would make me think that public school is a good idea.

Lord Bingham expressed support for the totalitarian concept of group rights when he described the Human Rights Convention as existing to protect minorities and is “intrinsically counter-majoritarian....should provoke howls of criticism by politicians and the mass media.

Homework- Give each student a David & Goliath Take Home Sheet for their parents to go over with them to review what we have done in class. Parents need to help their child fill this out and bring back to class the following week. Students that complete their homework and bring it back to class will be able to play Homeworkopoly. Each Sunday the students make a mini story book and/or story wheel in class. Students need to read these to their parents (or the parents read to them) the mini book and/or story wheel for homework.
Of course, the best part is that a good 90% of the collection's exclusive to the store, and in most cases not more than a handful have been produced. So whether you're shopping for your wedding, or just another party dress chances are you'll own the only one like it within miles.

This Saumur 2010, Val de Loire, Chenin Blanc is an excellent option to pair with a curry meal. It has a slightly tart, pineappe-ly overtone that brings a tropical fragrance to the forefront. It works well with the aggressive spicing of a curry. This wine also had a lovely woody back note that helped give it some depth and character.
It was about 2 when I left the markets. I wanted to go to Taejongdae cliff, but to go there, I had to take a bus 181 at Busan Station. I really didn’t know how to use a bus here. Everything was written in Korean. My guide book wrote it costed 600 won to go there by bus. While I waited for my bus, I saw most people use card when taking on it, and then I saw one boy holding 2 pieces of 1000 won note. He put them into the money box and then a lot of small coins came out. A little bit later my bus came. I stood at the back of the row. All the people used card except me using money. I put my 1000 won note in the money box, but change didn’t come out. I was surprised because my fare was only 600 won, but now I put 1000 won in it. A red face driver looked at the money box and turned to look at me with his big eyes. I was stuck there. I didn’t know what I should do. I thought maybe the machine failed to read my money. I wanted to tell him I already put money in it, but he wouldn’t understand me. Then, the bus driver said to me quietly, “Tho leave”. “To leave, what?” I was shocked. I already put money in it. He wanted me to get out of the bus. Why? I didn’t understand. Or I did sth wrong, or a foreigner couldn’t ride on this bus,…a lot of crazy ideas came to my head. He said again, ” To leave”. I had no idea. Maybe I had to leave. But before that I tried again I pull out one 1000 won note and showed him. I thought that maybe money machine didn’t read my money, so I could put it again. Suddenly, the driver nodded his head and raised 2 finger hand to me. Ah I understood him. He meant I had to put 2 notes in it. In fact, not ” to leave”, but ” Two leaves”. I was confused with his words. I got it. Thanks god…. I was relieved, I needn’t got out of the bus. I put another note in it, and then a lot of changes came out as what I saw a little boy had done it. The bus fare was 1200 won, different from what my guide book wrote.
MF/F: Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) – Inexplicably, Rooney has managed to quietly pile up 26 goals (only one behind RvP at this point) in the league and play some of his best football in years without too many people noticing. Okay, that may be an exaggeration, but I really can’t believe how little attention Rooney has received this year, but I think the next guy on this list had a little something to do with that.

However on Monday the comments were brought to the attention of Liverpool fans by a blog, making the most of what Davies said. This obviously caused fury amongst the LFC contingent who happily took to Twitter to launch a hail of abuse, anger and even a couple of ominous death predictions in the direction of Davies. Now, not everyone was going too far and there were some very sensible comments, but many fans totally overreacted without even hearing the podcast. Former LFC player Stan Collymore (who’s had his fair share of Twitter abuse in the past) also jumped on the bandwagon to have a go at Davies before later deleting his comments.
It seems like some unfortunate timing to us. Ramsay was in West Chester pitching his 11-piece collection of cookware, QVC’s Today’s Special Value at $120.
Standing up slowly, he picked up the bucket, holding it gingerly as he padded slowly to the small closet under the steps that held a toilet and a sink. On the way there, his glance caught the glint of sunlight on the battered aluminum gun case he had set down beside the antique wicker cabinet holding the few clothes he kept. His steps faltered, briefly, and one hand reflexively grasped at his sunken belly.

Whether or not creative writing can be taught is a much debated question. My own view - and I've had creative writing students - is that creative writing courses can impart techniques and help students develop skills they have, but if they have no native talent the course is a waste of time and money. Some courses are a waste of time and money anyway, because of the way they are taught or the people who teach them, but that's a different matter. But this post isn't about courses - it's about the individual, one-to-one help that an experienced writer sometimes gives an emerging or novice writer. We have all been asked by new writers to read their work. Some of us do it for money. Some of use do it out of generosity, or guilt, or because we feel obliged or coerced. Some of us just say no. I say no, but that doesn't mean I won't help...

No Regrets is an interesting, streamlined autobiography that doesn't get bogged down in ego, unnecessary descriptions of drug abuse, band strife, sex, etc., but still delivers on tasteful mentions of what sells these musician tell-alls: sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
This DOES match despite how it looks…in fact, it looks fantastic together. I wanted to run out of the dressing room which made me quite excited to don it in a race. YAY NEW RUNNING CLOTHES!
Having played for almost a continuous decade, Sgt. is one of the veteran post-rock bands in Japan. Sgt. can offer what only an experienced band can deliver, a tight sound. The composition of their music is a version of post-rock that is soaked with classical, noise, jazz and emo motifs. This can be attributed to the pr the essence of a female violinist who clutches onto the band’s sound and takes it in new directions.
"They" say that one of the most successful homemade wines comes from rhubarb. Well I happen to have a very large and prolific rhubarb patch, so this year I gave it a shot. The recipe was pretty straightfoward (I'm reproducing this from memory, so I may have to edit this when I can check my notes): Six pounds of chopped rhubarb to five pounds table sugar, water, wine yeast. I froze the rhubarb to help with juice extract, added everything to one of my plastic fermenters, and let it bubble along for a few days. Then I racked the still-fermenting wine off into a two gallon glass fermenter. As you can see, it was still very cloudy with yeast.

Friday night was the first time we'd left the kids with a non-family babysitter! We were lucky to have Lisa, our daycare provider's daughter, come over to watch the kids. She's known both of them since they were born! I think it all went well. They tested her a little bit, but they were asleep when we came home and that's all we could ask for! She did tell us that the minute we shut the door to leave Madelyn stood up in her booster chair and ripped off her bib as to say, "FREEDOM!" Yeah, she's 2...not 13. Britney said she was thinking, "this is going to be a long night!"
Tip 3: Be a ‘social butterfly’
There are those who feel that Miles’ attacks on rock groups are unfair and that he, in an odd sense, owes these performers a debt of gratitude. They see his appearances last year at the Fillmores East and West—Meccas for the rock cult—as a turning point in his career, but they seem to lose sight of the fact that these concerts, along with Columbia’s promotional efforts, would not have sold the public on Miles Davis if he had not had something substantial to offer. For over twenty years, Miles has pointed music in new directions, reaching unexplored plateaus, then forging ahead before others could catch up with him. “He has never been bound by convention,” says Teo Macero, who has produced virtually all of Miles’ recordings since 1958. “You wouldn’t expect Miles to go back and do something the way he did it years ago anymore than you would expect Picasso to go back to what he was doing in his ’blue’ or ’rose’ periods.”

4. Never wear a race event shirt for the (same) race you are about to do. Only rookies do this. It displays a total lack of integrity and might put the bad-heebee-jeebee-mojo on you for the race. Wearing a T-shirt of the race, while currently running said race, is discouraged. It’s like being at work and constantly announcing "I’m at work". Besides, you wont have the correct post-race shirt then...unless you like to wear sweaty, pitted-out clothes on a regular basis. If you do, then go back to the swamp, Gomer.
Monday I was stiff and sore all day. I forgot how much my lower-back hurts after a workout like that. I needed to keep moving so I wouldn't stiffen up entirely. My blisters felt much better, but my co-workers would laugh at me every time I walked around at work. We got a new person in the front office to help out. She ran the full marathon in 4 hrs and 20 minutes or something. Gaaak! It must be nice to have so much time to devote to training your body to take that kind of cruel and un-wholesome punishment.

Or maybe I used the word “steak.” I don’t even remember. Some people don’t like to see or hear words that remind them of food made from animals. I respect that. So I came on the blog and put all the words like that in quotation marks in the titles of all my recipes.

Invariably, Hey Jude and Stairway to Heaven would be sitting right at the top, maybe with Satisfaction hanging around at no. 3. Many Beatles fans might not even put that as their favorite Beatles song anymore, let alone as the best song in rock history. For my money, it’s an amazing song. It just does everything you want a bright, positive pop song to do. And, despite the fact that it’s a piano song, it’s got balls.

We can only assume that there is something the Banks and servicers are not telling the pensioners who rely upon funds that were heavily invested in the bogus mortgage bonds. Could it be that if the pensioners collectively and the homeowners collectively got together and compared notes they would discover the problem: that when their fund manager put up the money for loans, there were no loans? Or that the investment bank removed 20%–40% of the funds and converted them to fees and profits leaving only a fraction of the money of the pensioners to fund mortgages?
Let's be very clear, did any American citizen ever confuse any politician or any U.S. political institution with a super hero? I would settle for a Congressman or Congresswoman who just applied a little dedication, a little focus, some unselfish, and some compassion to their job, a super hero is a little too much to expect, given our politcians' track records.
Hey ho! How strangely post-modern to be a historical novelist who ends up on the ‘wrong’ side of history.
President Obama, rather than following important events around the world and with our economy, clearly is just sitting in the White House listening to talk radio and making phone calls to people mentioned on talk radio stations. The President did not call the CEO of BP earlier about the oil spill, even though he was called many names by bloggers, radio show hosts, and comedians, further demonstrating his poor judgement and poor decision making skills.

In the last couple of weeks the feud between Chris Jericho and CM Punk has really picked up steam. I think the WWE dropped the ball at the Royal Rumble and in the Elimination Chamber by not having Jericho win one of them. They killed their own momentum as they struggled to try to outsmart the IWC and the marks who were certain Jericho would win the Rumble and then obviously wanted CM Punk to go into WrestleMania as the champion which somewhat handcuffed them with the Elimination Chamber itself. Thankfully, CM Punk and Chris Jericho are bright enough to save the feud when the WWE did their best to drop the ball on it.

At the end of next month, I will be going to the Vipassana center in Jesup, GA to be a server for the course. As a server, I will have a particular job to do to help the course run smoothly. I think the lesson is to learn to give back and learn from the role of a server what humility is about. I am assisting in helping people to learn a practice that will make their lives better. Looking at it that way, humility is not so low. It is understanding my small role.

In November 1978, Petitioner filed an application for post-conviction relief, Okla.Stat.Ann. tit. 22, Sec. 1080 (West 1986), in the state district court in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In that application the only issue Petitioner raised was that he had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because the trial court refused to sever the trials or appoint separate counsel for Petitioner and Dodson. Petitioner did not raise a double jeopardy issue in this post-conviction application. The state district court denied Petitioner’s application in February 1980, and the denial was later affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in an unpublished order.

Hi Readers — This note is RIGHT ON!
I told you to go on if you dare! Now the first thing people ask me is, "Is your house haunted?" Truth is, if it is, I certainly haven't seen or felt anything - but with a house this old you can bet that someone has left some part of their spirit here - if you believe in that sort of thing.

June 18, 2011 — Defence calls a new witness, Dr. Werner Spitz, who questions the medical examiner’s autopsy, including the failure to open the skull, and says there was no indication the death was a homicide. He believes the duct tape was placed on the skull after decomposition and that the crime scene photos of the position of the hair on the skull were staged, possibly by the medical examiner.
Christians are rightly concerned about the state of culture in our day. The fear is that, as the culture continues its decline into mere sensuality and self-indulgence, it will drag our children and us down with it.
For example, I was put on the spot to entertain a crowd of cattle producers at a field day after the planned activities were rained out. (Note: never plan and always be prepared) I had no prepared material (see). So this was off the cuff. Now I went into a hot topic about another country and trade deals. I had just returned home from that country so I had a new fresh perspective. The very instant I said something that went against the American paradigm, the room emptied. Around fifty to seventy people walked out. The twenty or so that remained encouraged me to go on. See there was little willingness to accept a different view. People are willing to change as long as they can keep doing what they are doing. Yes I wrote that exactly how I wanted it. There is no need to change because the excuses are built in. We have had the same failures for so long they are now accepted as normal.

“How can we get original thought on the prayer-meeting topics? Only by study of the Bible, followed by meditation and observation. First, the Endeavorer should read the Bible passage; then he should read some good commentary upon it; then he should take the subject with him into his daily life for five or six days, thinking about it in his odd minutes and watching for experiences in his own life, or the lives of others, or of observing nature and looking for illustrations on the subject from all these sources

We went into Firelands last night to help other people do steps to get their staff. The race to get through Firelands as quickly as possible is not conducive to the step I’m on, and I’m not on anyone’s priority list for the staff.
Now, maybe dude wasn’t as interested in me as I thought. Could be possible, but it certainly seemed like he couldn’t keep his eyes off of me. Or maybe he was attracted, but wasn’t available so he chose to stay away. Another probability is that maybe I had crab stuck in my teeth or something (even though I’m pretty sure I didn’t) – although, if I did… hey, maybe that could have been a great opening for him to come up and SAY SOMETHING to me! Either way, nothing happened. A few hours passed and the cookout began to slowly die down and everyone went their separate ways.

Was it worth it? “In terms of striking a blow against terrorism in general, (the bin Laden raid) was absolutely critical because it showed the US is true to its word and no matter how well protected you are and no matter how well secreted you are, we’re going to find you and get you,” said Georgetown University’s Bruce Hoffman, a counter-terrorism expert and former adviser to the US Office of National Security Affairs.
Ellen summed up the author’s dilemma beautifully when she wrote: ‘I have to think I’m damned good, or I’d give up.’ And it’s true. Self-belief is important, and it’s so hard to hang onto and when something good comes along to reinforce it, then why not share it?

I still think it’s quite funny and ironic how our minds work. I have noticed as I continue to write this blog that stories I didn’t even recall start coming back to the top of my conscious memory from my sub-conscious memory. As I wrote my story yesterday of the teacher that my 11th grade class bullied, I started to recall one of the last bullying incidents I had in 7th grade in Lexington, MA. What brought the memory back was that it was also the story of a teacher, but in this case it was a teacher the chose to do the bullying.
When you make a commodity you can be outsourced. If you don't make anything special, anyone can do what you do.
I read his email. His rant, his spew of word carefully chosen to manipulate me, to make me feel guilty. It was incredibly long, but I read every word. The expected response was to cry and beg his forgiveness, to promise anything and some how I would end up being the bad guy and him the wronged one. A track of emotional abuse that I had been running for almost a year. And I was having trouble keeping up.

I got a call from Disney today while I was at work and gave them a call back on my lunch. I spoke with the very nice cast member, Yolanda. I basically retold my story to her. She informed me that well, basically every single cast member that we spoke with was wrong in one way or another. A HUGE amount of bad training caused cast members to think that Friends and Family could receive a dining plan discount. Apparently that is never true. Only cast members can actually receive a discount on this. Good to know.
I've been ill for days with a sore throat and ache thing, so today, feeling a bit better, I packed Poppets and sent them on their ways with apologies for the delay. If you're waiting for arrivals and wondering, please don't hesitate for a second to ask after them. I'd always rather hear from you than not.
The lesson for humans: if you want to be healthy, stay on top. It might be that "game" not only affects success with women, but could affect one's health. Even faking it until making it might do the job, i.e. one could perhaps even fool one's own body that one is high status.
There is another kind of second reading too, which allows us to experience all over again a feeling of unqualified pleasure. If every book is in some way a second reading of a life, then the great novels of the world capture that life most abundantly.
There are a lot of things that I tell myself I can't do just because I haven't been doing them. I can't keep the bathroom floors mopped or finish the living room paint job that I started a year ago. I can't pack school lunches every day. I can't edge the lawn. I'm a busy woman and I just don't have time for those things. But my friend has clean floors. My dad finishes his painting in a reasonable time frame. My neighbor edges his lawn.

Despite my dreams of Medical School, I was getting bored of just studying health and science subjects all the time. I took on a Painting and decorating NVQ, and whilst on the course considered setting up my own business with the only other girl doing the course, but I got bored again, left the course once I had learnt enough to do my own decorating and enrolled on a Catering NVQ course. I completed this one, so I am a qualified chef, but I never wanted to work in a kitchen, just wanted to be a better cook (thankfully!).
So my question is should I just start writing and fill in the research as I go along or should I wait to start writing until I finish my research? Or should I just do nothing?

“I lived during the time of the Old Testament. The Lord commanded me to go into a strange land and spy out the best way to conquer the people.

I have researched prices of cameras in Jakarta (I went to Ratu Plaza and Best Electronics Store in Senayan City) and found out that the prices are much higher here than the ones in Japan or U.S. The camera my husband wants is almost the double the price of that you can find in the States if you get it in Jakarta. Crazy…
This would be a good time to add the copper. It’s pretty in the sun, and it will help aid in making those bones, and the hemoglobin, and red blood cells, and after we add the iron, it will assist iron in the release of energy. The human will like that part.
Aaaah, I had forgotten how satisfying it is to just bang out a bunch of prints in a row. Instant gratification. Screen printing really is the medium of choice for the impatient. In the textiles department at my college, we could choose to specialize in either printing, knitting or weaving. It was so obvious who the printers were. We were the ones with the messy work spaces, lids left off pots of ink, unbrushed hair, and fingers stained.
To most Manchester United fans I’ve seen comment, Suarez is guilty. No doubt about it. And what’s more he should be locked up and have the key thrown away, so heinous is his crime. On the flipside, most Liverpool fans appear to know that Suarez is innocent. No doubt about it whatsoever. And what’s more Evra should be locked up and have the key thrown away, so heinous is the crime of having the temerity to accuse a Liverpool player of anything.

The meeting broke up at 1am. We said our goodbyes and set off into the Amsterdam night. As I walked around the corner to my friend’s apartment I realised how safe I felt. How different the expat world is from our lives back in London. And why it was easier to talk about books than write them when I lived in Amsterdam.

Ok....so maybe it didn't start like that. But it does start in a local tavern in the city of Sawwave, on a rainy and cold November night. Our six main characters were sitting at a table, talking about what was soon to be their future. We shall present them in order of their high-score in Pac Man:

Instead, my “aliveness” seems to have horrified them. I don’t know what to do. They gave me life. They did not physically abort me. I carry their genes. I carry more of them than I even know because they refuse to let me know. I would like to thank them. My parents expressed a desire to thank them once they were found. . . .
We started out our day doing an early morning photo shoot using her vanity and props. Its was a 1960's Sandra Dee theme using a nightie I purchased on my first day.

The first thing you notice is that the star potential is taken off the table as there is no men’s 100 in either meet. Given that a) the 200 is the lesser contested of the two sprints (100/200) in any season, let alone an Olympic one, and b) with Trials meets coming up it will be less likely to see a sprinter here than in the 100, it’s a fairly safe bet that seeing Bolt, Gay, Dix, Blake, et al is nearly slim to none in the U.S. No offense to any of the other star level athletes out there, but there goes a large chunk of the star quality and drawing power in this sport – no offense just fact at this point – because right now the 100 is The marquee event in the sport.
Hi there! Hope you all had a great weekend! I arrived home yesterday late afternoon from my weekend away papercrafting event. I had such a great time, I can't wait to show you some of the projects we created. I need to print photos to complete a few layouts and a mini book before I share. I've never attended a crop nor a workshop so I was a bit unsure what I had gotten myself into but what an AWESOME surprise!!! I have the day off from work today so I am going to work on a few of those projects so I can share them with you :)
This Friday marks my blogs first birthday! I wish I had some big celebration planned, but I am trying to plan Cassy's 2nd birthday, so I am a little overwhelmed with that right now.
Gavin DeGraw and Karina Smirnoff did the foxtrot. Does he always wear that hat? Brendan does. He wears a cap and even sleeps in it. They let him wear it at school. We'll have to wean him off of it. Back to the dance - it was pretty good. Difficult dance, first week. Score: 7, 6, 7 = 20.

For humans, when your fear stops you in your tracks, do not run from it. Wait quietly to see if the threat is real or imagined. You may find that it disappears. The predator is not your enemy. It is the fear that gets you in trouble as you imagine many possible outcomes. You can do like I do and simply wait and then resume your play.”
I have several varieties, all of which flower at slightly different times. One variety, named Jewell, must have been flowering at exactly the wrong time and the clipper has removed a high percentage of the buds. The other varieties have much less damage. To a limited extent, the plants can compensate by increasing the size of the remaining berries. However, if too many buds are clipped, it is simply impossible to fully compensate.

That's the process we're seeing at this moment. The left's civilized elite are still living a delusion, gliding through toga world, while the more unstable elements, the SEIU trash, the anarchists, the ACORN hirelings, are starting to lose it. It will get worse as the Obama dream continues to shred under the pressure of reality. The American left has begun to crack -- deterioration has set in, and it is beginning the long slide into goonhood.

And finally the last New Age concept is love. Now certainly New Agers do not hold a monopoly on this concept, but we do embrace it whole heartedly. Parents. Children. Spouses. Friends.

The Silver Legacy hotel and casino in Reno, the site of this September's Gun Blogger Rendezvous, has been struggling financially, like most of the casinos out there. Part of this is due to the economy, and part of it is due to additional competition from tribal casinos.

This entry – and particularly this graphic got me thinking about my own blogging. When it comes to my blogging, it is something that I take some pride in – both in terms of the time I invest into it and the end result of what gets posted here for those who read this blog (either directly or via RSS). This has cause some navel gazing on my part in the past, including participating in both the 30 Days to Being a Better Blogger series that Steve Dembo did (see my entries for the series at 30 days) and the 31 Days to Build a Better Blog journey by ProBlogger Blog Tips (see my entries for the series at 31 days).

I have witnessed accidents because of low visibility around the trash trucks, and a number of times we have had tire tracks swerving up to our lawn and back down to the street.
Unfortunately this lowers the book’s rating from a four or five-star classification to a three, but I still want to recommend this collection of historical anecdotes for the rest of it. This is Canadian history that needs to be preserved as part of our culture and heritage. Three stars.

Be ruthlessly realistic: “Saint Anthony said to Poemen, ‘expect trials and temptations until your last breath.’” “I am convinced that not even the apostles, although filled with the Holy Spirit, were therefore completely free from anxiety. . . .

So-called "calvinistic" Baptists or "particular" Baptists are unconfessional and essentially Anabaptist since they place as much emphasis on personal revelations and leadings of the "spirit" as they do on Scripture. Basically, Baptists have more in common with Pentecostals than with Presbyterians or Anglican Reformed believers. Any emphasis on "believers" baptism is an outright denial of unconditional election since this ignores the fact that God elects prior to the foundation of the world, not at the moment someone receives Christ by faith. Credo-baptism has more in common with decisional conversion or the altar call conversion of Charles Finney than with the paedo-baptism taught by the foreshadow of infant circumcision in the Old Testament. The overemphasis on individual conversion ignores that God works through the church as His normative appointed instrument or means of saving His elect. The OT church was the nation of Israel and the NT church was established at the day of Pentecost and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. (Acts 2:1-4; 38-39).
When Katie first came to live with us, it was hard. Really hard. She was very resentful toward Jenny. She wanted nothing to do with her. She saw her as a threat to her mother's memory. She was afraid that loving Jenny would mean forgetting her mom; or maybe it would mean letting go, or perhaps just moving on. She wasn't ready to do that yet. So she would lash out in anger toward Jenny, sometimes for no reason at all. She was more open and accepting towards me, I guess because I was filling the hole that was left by her father years earlier, and she was so young when he died that she didn't really remember much about him. But Jenny was filling a hole that was far too new. The wounds were too fresh, and she wasn't ready for that yet.

Then came accident. We were at a show and she was actually well behaved for once so I let my ambitions get the better of me. I did hear on the loud speaker that four horses had taken a bad fall before I went in, but I figured that they had not been in control of their horses. That was not the case. The hall was lethal and I should have backed out once the second rider fell. The show should have been canceled. As it turned out, the floor in the hall had just been redone, but not properly so is was deep and lose, making is feel like you were riding on ice. As soon as we set hoof inside I should have turned around.
We've also visited Mr A's parents, and his dad and I managed to scrape our way through the slow second movement of the Mozart Clarinet Concerto a few times. Neither of us had practised a great deal, so there were many stoppages and "take it from bar 48 again" moments, but he really enjoyed it and expressed the view that it was a shame we live so far away. I think we'll have to work up to the first and third movements over a longer period, because those have a lot more notes to squeeze into a bar.
Del Rey started playing classical guitar when she was four. As a teenager, she met bluesman Sam Chatmon who inspired her to become a blues queen. Her guitar playing combines country blues, stride piano, classic jazz and hillbilly boogie through the sensibility of an autodidact trailor-park esthete. Her live show is full of complex guitar grooves and sly humor.

After this we took the road through Darling to the West Coast National Park, seeing beautiful flowers along the road! On arriving at the Park we realised that the coastal regions do not have the same vegetation and therefore no wild flowers! We were so thankful for the pamphlet and knowing the Lord's provision for us. We made a u-turn and went back the way we came! This time, however, we stopped at the orchid show in Darling and what a beautiful blessing that was! We 'oohed and aahed' about all the flowers and it was such a pretty sight! Needless to say - we came back with our first ever orchids! (see the two orchid photos)

With the final count down started, I just wonder whats on your wish list? What have you wished for this season, what is it that would out do the M &S toiletries, those slipper from Auntie and that box of chocolates that are not your favourites?

Clearly without the overwhelming support from you all, I never would have won 11 states and over 3 million votes, and we would not have won more counties than all the other candidates combined. I can assure you that even though I am no longer a candidate for president, I will still continue to fight every day for our shared values - the values that made America the greatest country in the history of the world.

That’s completely wrong. Blogs, like every other periodical on earth, must have a regular date and time they will be written and released This gives your readers something solid to hold on to, to look forward to. You want your readers to know that you are a person of deadlines and schedules; someone they can rely on.

Now that your third book is about to be published, are there any valuable lessons you've learnt along the way?
Just to put into perspective how popular Jekyll and Hyde was: It sold 40,000 copies in its first six months of publication. This was astounding at the time. By 1901, it had sold more than 250,000 copies. This was at a time when the common person on the street couldn't read at more than the most basic level. Many couldn't even write their own names. Public readings of Jekyll and Hyde were not uncommon.
The first few pages of this book had me hooked. The storyline was kind of 'Men in Black' crossed with 'Stargate' and although it was immediately over the top it kinda had you enjoying it!

Thanks to his showcase, Jinguk is getting signed to a record label and leaving Kirin High. Hyemi stands outside at night, crying over Jinguk as he leaves and wearing his spare motorcycle helmet which he left for her. She tries to tell Samdong why she's crying, but Samdong breaks down and yells for her not to tell him. Then he makes up his own reason: she's crying over Jinguk because he's debuting before Hyemi, and she's jealous of this success, right? Samdong's basically begging her not to tell him that she cares for the other guy. Hyemi obliges him, and doesn't tell him the real reason.

The story is always on my mind and in the last week, my characters have started to get chatty. I’m getting snippets of conversations between them and I love what I’m hearing.
At first, when I ordered it off the website, I thought “Why do I need this? I can just use x instead of spending the cash”, but then I told myself to (wo)man up and buy it because I have ten runs completed, I deserve it, and it is better than wolfing down a cupcake to celebrate my achievement (which was motis operandi up until now).

As I sat in my third grade classroom in PS 179 I could hear them roaring towards us. From my desk I could look out the window and see their long yellow roofs. They parked in front of the school entranceway on Avenue C. With their diesel engines just clattering away, I knew it was my time to go. On every Wednesday at 2 o’clock my stomach would start to hurt. It was time for the public school Christians to leave our sanctuary of bliss and head North up East 3rd street to The Immaculate Heart of Mary school. It was time for “Religious Instructions”.

I've had a request to repost a couple of things by BTWS from a friend of the blog, Marc.
I made two ice cream cakes, one is for Max's birthday and the other one I was planning to bring to a housewarming party at a friend's house. The one for housewarming didn't quite make it there because we lived about an hour away. I stopped at my brother's house on the way to take a picture really quick but it was melted (as you can see in the picture). A quick trip to the freezer didn't seem to help either as it was so hot in the house. I guess I wasn't very smart in deciding what to bring to the party this time :(. So, it was my brother's luck that I had to leave the ice cream cake there for him and his family as I wouldn't possibly drive another 40 minutes with semi-melting ice cream in my car.
We live on one side of a mountain that separates us from downtown Lima proper. To travel into the City of Kings, we need to cross over this mountain. However, to do this, the pass that the city engineers have…um…engineered is as crazy, convoluted, and twisted as a bobsled run. Here’s a clip from Google Maps of the road of which I speak…

She says that she's not very up on today's folk scene, although she's seen The Unthanks and liked them very much, prompting me to send her an email with some links on it to things I thought she might like. They were towards the festival headlining end of the folky spectrum, though, and now I'm wondering whether I should have included more female voices.

When first introducing this strategy I give students documents and/or primary sources with all information available. The students must find the author of the document, place and time it was created, prior knowledge they have on the document or events surrounding it, audience it was intended for, reason or purpose for the document, them or main idea, and finally the significance of how the document affects or best has an impact on our world today.
Party Guy is very direct, arguably to the point sometimes of inappropriateness, but so far I like it. I know where I stand with him. He said, "you're pretty"; "you've still got it going on" (i.e., despite my age); "I think you're kind of sophisticated"; "you dye your hair"; "you clearly work out"; "yours are the biggest boobs I've ever had my hands on." He is not shy. It's nice.

It may be just a shrub, but Corylus avellana has played a significant part in the changing landscape of the Weald and the industrial development of the British Isles. The Weald has a unique combination of the requirements for producing iron that allowed it to become a major iron producing area from pre-Roman times until the Industrial Revolution shifted iron production northwards: iron ore in the sandstone geology, clay to produce bricks for furnaces, streams to power the mills that drove bellows and furnace in the forge; but also extensive woodlands (the name Weald derives from the Old English word for ‘forest’) that provided the necessary charcoal. A variety of species were cut to feed the charcoal kilns (including Ash, Oak and Alder), but because of its abundance and quick regrowth once coppiced, Hazel was a favoured species. The ‘coppice-with-standards‘ method of woodland management, whereby a shrubby understorey, often of Hazel, is cut regularly but on a shorter cycle than the ‘standards’ (e.g. Oak, Ash) that are allowed to grow on to produce timber, is what has given the woodlands of the Weald their character and structure. It should be remembered, however, that much woodland was cleared for agriculture such that what remains is somewhat fragmented.

Entering the world of the suburbs does not mean fear for me, but often a kind of ennui. With a few rare exceptions, the suburbs of Paris are not attractive places. They are scruffy, the result of inexistant urban planning. Fast roads send cars thundering through what were their historic hearts and viaducts carry streams of trains through industrial estates or over back gardens. And yet there is something endlessly fascinating about these places if you scratch through this opaque vision.

It literally seems like the shoe is on the other foot. I’ve often wanted to be asked to do an interview, especially when I’ve seen how much time and effort a particular author has put into it for me. So it’s great to get ‘out there’ and do some of my own.
And they're good people, too, not narcissistic bastards like some aging stars can become. During the show, a fan waved a copy of their first album. Guitarist Gibbons waved the man up to the stage, chatted with him a minute or so, and then all three of the band members autographed it. Then he pretended to auction it off, talking fast and sounding for all the world like a real auctioneer -- "OK, the bidding starts at $1000, over here do I hear $1000, $1000 over here.... Nah, I'm just kiddin'!" And he gave the album back to the fellow, to loud applause.

Now this is where I think all the talking heads have their terminology backwards. Marriage existed before this country existed, and before the Bible existed, too, for that matter. My marriage is a sacred covenant between my wife and myself with our God as our witness. (If you are an atheist, your marriage is still a covenant between you and your spouse.) In either case, the “state” is not part of these covenants. Now, if I want to put my wife on my insurance or if one of us is physically incapacitated and the other needs to make a decision, the state wants to recognize our (partnership, union, covenant, marriage, whatever) to LEGALLY recognize these decisions. This recognition by the state is of our “civil union”, not our marriage, regardless of the way the words are being used in the present debates.

The same thing with the health care debate. The mandate is an anti-freedom stance, but they try to say they’re for more freedom by ending worries about health care, which is BS. One thing is freedom and one thing isn’t; it’s not debatable. Putting a gun to someone’s head and saying, “You must buy health insurance!” isn’t freedom and no one should pretend it is. It’s okay to take an anti-freedom stance, you just should frame it terms of why you think your ideas are better than liberty. And that will probably also help you understand why so many people don’t like your views, as the left always seems to get caught off guard by that." --Frank J.

The book was realistic. In the sense that the scenarios were all down-to-earth, possible and believable. Everything in the book was as real as fact. It was very true to what would have most likely happened in real life.
This Saturday we will be having our first Herbal Home Remedies Class. I still have three seats available. If you want to know more about how you can use natural remedies (ones you probably have in your kitchen right now) to treat your family, you should attend our class.
Of course, you can see the trouble already. A beautiful lady pickers her seat as 3C, avoiding the creepy dude in 9D. But after she books, along comes an "extra creepy" dude who can't believe his luck. He books himself into 3B. So does the lady in 3C get to monitor who books after her? If so, she'll quickly dodge a bullet and move to 17A. But lets face it, she won't be safe...another creepy dude will just pop into her world.

Finally, the Court pointed out that the intentions of the Act are clearly not to safeguard consumers from counterfeits, but rather just to protect IP rights of individuals - "It would be in violation of the state’s obligations to the petitioners with respect to their right to life and health to have included in legislation ambiguous provisions subject to the interpretation of intellectual property holders and customs officials when such provisions relate to access to medicines essential for the petitioners’ survival."

I'm injured. It's nothing terrible like a broken leg or foot. I can walk pretty normally and seem to be fine riding my bike but running is a different story. I started to notice a bit of pain in my left knee toward the end of my 8 mile run on Saturday. When I got home and out of the car I started to limp - going down the stairs was the worst. It felt a lot like the IT Band issues I had a couple of years ago so I got out the foam roller - serious pain but I was hopeful it would help. I made myself walk normally throughout the day thinking I just needed to work through the discomfort and it would be fine. I was cautiously optimistic this morning when I went out to run. I said a little prayer - asking God for protection, strength and perseverance. I walked for a few minutes to warm things up - then I started hobbling along at a faster pace but much to my dismay after about a half mile the discomfort turned to pain and didn't subside. I walked the remaining 1.5 miles home a bit dejected.

The first person to witness this unlikely creature was driving along a country road in Loveland Ohio, when he noticed some odd looking animals at the side of the road. He pulled over to get a better look and couldn't believe what he was seeing. A number of strange amphibian-like creatures were moving along the side of the road. He claimed later that one of them "took out a wand like object and produced glowing sparks". A search of the area later revealed no signs of the creatures.
One of my best friends at the bank appears to have run out of all his options to find something inside, even at a lower level. All the talk and go-get-‘em assurances about “Oh, you’ll find something” have fallen through. It just drives me crazy but him more so. He’s nearing panic-mode. I don’t know what a guy of his standing and age in life will do. There really aren’t any parallels to my situation because things were wholly different, but all I can do for Mike is hope that something pops at the last minute. Internal alliances and allegiances aren’t what they used to be. No one has his back, and that is distressing to me. His reviews are good; he just got caught in the cuts. That’s about all there is to it. That’s the way business is these days for better or worse, and from my view it’s decidedly worse.

Well, I am a cuticle/finger picker. I know, gross. This awful habit started back in eighth grade – and no, I can’t remember a single traumatic event that triggered it – aside from being asked to fight by the resident eighth grade hard ass. I turned her down, of course, but I swear I remember puking a little as I told her no. Okay, back to the unusual writing habit. I can’t say my finger picking, and subsequent band-aid wearing, actually helps me write, but its something I do A LOT of as I write. I’m typing right now with band-aids on my fingers. Since I’ve had this habit for quite a while, I’ve had time to think deeply and analyze why/when I do it. It happens when I’m deep in thought (writing is about as deep in thought as any human being can be, eh?) and when I’m doubting myself (again, when I’m writing I have this annoying voice that whispers, “You can’t do this. Stop. You can’t write a book.”). Stupid voice. My fingers seem to always be at varying degrees of picking – some days I’ve got five band-aids on (no lie) – some days I’ll just get to one finger – some days I don’t seem to focus on my fingers. It’s a horrible habit. I wish I didn’t do it. I wish I could stop doing it. But at least it’s not drugs or alcohol – or some other uber life altering habit. I can handle band-aids.
Enjoy and Happy 4th of July!
When you pray outside an abortuary, as Monsignor Reilly told the London pro-life community in May, the primary reason for being there is the saving of souls. This is even more important than the saving of the lives of unborn children, although of course it is a great blessing and cause for great joy that lives are saved when women choose not to go through with an abortion.
