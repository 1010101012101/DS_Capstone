This is it. You can style the whole thing as you like.
But wherever there is oppression there is resistance: that is true everywhere, forever. The resistance is built body by body from the other two percent, from the stalwart, the brave, the determined, who are willing to stand against both power and social censure. It is our thesis that there will be no mass movement, not in time to save this planet our home. That two percent in other times has been able to shift both the cultural consciousness and the power structures toward justice: Margaret Mead’s small group of thoughtful, committed citizens. It’s valid to long for a movement, no matter how much we rationally know that we’re wishing on a star. Theoretically, the human race as a whole could face our situation and make some decisions—tough decisions, but fair ones, that include an equitable distribution of both resources and justice, that respect and embrace the limits of our planet. But none of the institutions that govern our lives, from the economic to the religious, are on the side of justice or sustainability. Most of them, in fact, are violently on the side of capital–E Evil. And like with the individually destructive, these institutions could be forced to change. The history of every human rights struggle bears witness to how courage and sacrifice can dismantle power and injustice. It takes bravery and persistence, political intelligence and spiritual strength. And it also takes time. If we had a thousand years, even a hundred years, building a movement to transform the dominant institutions around the globe would be the task before us. But the earth is running out of time. The western black rhinoceros is definitely out of time. So is the golden toad, the pygmy rabbit. No one is going to save this planet except us.
Yeah, whatever. Patty Sackville, thanks for joining us.
A little while back I completed my first trade with Brian from Pirates Treasure Room. The primary bait for the trade was the 2012 Topps Wal Mart Drew Pomeranz for an 87 mini Andrew McCutchen. What started out as a simple 1-for-1 deal morphed into a larger trade involving several other cards. The card in the middle is one of my 33 Todd Helton relics, it is from the 2002 Topps set. The final card is from Panini's first card set involving real major league players in a long time. I hope they get better.
When you close the back door, on the wall to the right, is this little message board. I am proudly displaying 2 coloring book pages and Sam's report card (all A's!). I have been changing out the verse monthly. The January verse was Jeremiah 29:11...For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future.

Neil Young - Rust Never Sleeps - 1979
The writing is terse, frightfully vivid, beautiful and un-relenting - the lost at sea chapters were hypnotic - until the reader too, was hallucinating rescue and imaginary banquets - which is quite a feat, as to the gripping desire to survive at the bequest of dying companions, which was black and horrific, yet never failed to stir empathy while making me feel sick.
Perhaps now Big G and I will be able to put down some new roots? Goodness knows, we have a bag full of homeless, dangling roots that need to be dug in somewhere.

Mr. Yarnworks returned to the war and I dutifully went to PT 3x a week for 6 weeks. While I enjoyed the massages, they really didn't help the headache. Exploring my options, I also visited an eye doctor for the first time in....well, in my adult life. I'd felt that my vision was getting worse, but had avoided the eye doctor, so with the headache, it was time to go. Verdict? 20/20 vision....but it COULD be corrected to 20/15 if I wanted. So I got glasses. They greatly help with road signs and such, but didn't help with the headaches. So at least I ruled that out. The eye doctor was also a bit concerned about my field-of-vision test, which showed a blip on each eye where I couldn't see. The same spot on each eye, just mirror image. To her, that screamed of a pituitary gland issue.
We arrived on Friday with plenty of time to attend the Athlete Expo and pick up my race packet. My bib number was 849. We wandered around the Expo and I was able to buy a new pair of bike gloves (I had lost my own). And then I discovered a booth operated by a local chiropractor, offering free massage to the athletes. I want to take this moment to say THANK YOU to Gonzalez Chiropractic in Monterey, CA. My left calf had been in pain for 3 days prior to the race. I was afraid of experiencing a cramp during the swim (this had happened to me during training). The lovely chiropractor worked out all the "little bits of concrete" (his words) from my calf. He then taped up my leg for the next day. God bless him . . . I know it made a difference. Then my parents arrived and we headed to BUBBA GUMPS for a wonderful dinner. It was so nice to have my parents there - my biggest fans, no matter what I do!

I was flabbergasted. There is no trace of cancer in my blood or urine. They've ruled out diabetes and kidney failure. They gave me antibiotics for the resurgent head/chest cold. I have an echo scheduled for the 12th and I see them again on March 13th. March 13th is Mama Kelley's birthday, she would have been 99 had she lived. Everyone thinks it's a good omen.

Butterfly bush is next on my list. It takes a while for it to come back each year, but I love the fact that it attracts butterflies. I have had difficulties establishing these plants, so I wonder if they are a bit less hardy than some of my other choices. Perhaps it’s my soil, however, because there are several plants that refuse to grow for me.
The next novel that will be submitted to publishers is called My Sister and Other Liars and is a totally different kind of novel. It’s a coming of age story about Sam, a teenage girl, whose sister was attacked and left brain damaged. The police have no evidence about the attack and are closing the case so Sam has decided to find her sister’s attacker and enact her own revenge.

So how does one determine the truth? It is not a comparative study, as you would have in a religion class in the public school. Such truth is not intellectually discerned. Remember the words of 1 Corinthians 2:14. “They are spiritually discerned.”
Sound: Brian Warner began his career while going to college for a journalism degree, and formed the band The Spooky Kids. Later on the name was changed to the name of Brian‘s stage persona, Marilyn Manson, and through connections he had made with Trent Reznor of NIN had their debut album “Portrait Of An American Family” released on Reznor‘s record label and went on tour to support NIN. This sky-rocketed Marilyn Manson to national infamy due to the controversial persona that Marilyn Manson had developed. Although initially the concept for the band was something between industrial metal and hardcore punk rock, their musically gravitated towards more of an alternative metal sound. Over the years, Marilyn Manson has cultivated his stage persona in order to create and sustain a level of shock from the general public which has often over-shadowed their music.

Last week on my birthday, a dear friend of mine gifted me a book. Chetan Bhagat’s latest – Revolution 2020. The one I asked him not to get for me! Bhagat’s ‘One night at the Call Centre’ was such a disaster that overnight he had fallen down my list of readable writers. I fail to understand what is it about him that everyone around me keeps buying his books and reading them and despite my vehement refusal to read his books, they end up in my house. Now I have a problem with ignoring any unread book on my shelf. I just cannot let that pass. So inadvertently, I have read almost all of his books so far.
I turn 30 next month and I am EXCITED FOR IT!!!! 30 doesn't scare me for some reason. I'm excited for my 30's. 29 has been a rocky year but as I get closer to 30 things just keep getting better. So why the heck shouldn't I celebrate with a huge party? Okay, some might think I'm strange and wonder why I'm throwing myself a big party. Well I'm the party planner, right? And I think birthday's are a big deal. Everyone should feel special on their birthday. It's the day you were born. The day you came into this world and changed it forever so celebrate it for heaven's sake!

What is clear is this: the filling must contain butter and sugar, but not so much that it becomes cloyingly sweet. You can add a little cream if you like, but just a little. Many people like adding some maple syrup, not only for the taste, but because it adds a distinctly Canadian touch, the idea being that if you want to have some national pride, pouring in a little sap from the national tree is the least you can do. Anyway, white sugar is so pedestrian.

But today, as on those other days, Delia cannot make herself say this. Even if she could she knows that Mr Plummer would probably take no notice and make her anyway. So she doesn't speak. Trembling from that hand at her bottom Delia meekly does what she has to. It is another test: supposedly self-discipline rather than concentration this time. She must raise her skirt, up round her waist. Standing quite still and straight, high heels together, she must lift the short skirt up to her waist and thereby display what is underneath. Which is only that suspender belt plus the brief web-like knickers.

This famous quote from Adams has been made more famous by Richard Dawkins often quoting it not just in books but also in various debates.
First, Nehru drew half million strong crowds in meeting after meeting in Calcutta, Bombay, Lahore, Delhi, Madras and Lucknow in June. These mass meetings were completely unprecedented, and continue even in today’s electronic age. Organised by Jaya Prakash Narayan, the leader of the ‘left faction’ of Congress, these showed Nehru’s command over the party rank and file.
And this is how it’s done: If you want to save kids, go help a few already born and starving ones instead of wasting your time in a parking lot judging me. If you’d rather stand in the parking lot judging, then have at it, but don’t be surprised when the only difference you make is raising my blood pressure and my middle finger. That’s my opinion. I don’t shout it in anyone’s face and I generally only give it if I’m directly asked.

The conventicle at ‘Woolf-hole-craig’ was mentioned in the Alexander Shields’ Life of James Renwick, which was written in 1688, but not published until 1724. According to Shields, who was quoting from a proclamation against Renwick on 20 September 1684, Renwick had preached at Black-loch, ‘Woolf-hole-craig’ and Greenock. (Shields, Life of Renwick, 55.)

What I discovered from this analysis is that while recessions can occur without negative real interest rates, whenever negative real interest rates do occur, they are always followed by an eventual recession. This occurred in 1957, 1974, 1980 and 2008.
If we lived in a police state I wouldn't be able to go about my business without fear nor favour either. No utopia to be gained from that. I would love to say "The Police must distance itself from political control and revert to the Peel Principles upon which it was founded", because that would actually be nice. The Peel Principles are fairly Libertarian as far as I can see and they make good common sense. But that will never happen. Their world is run by HR and that, is that.

If the NHS in England needs to save this obscene amount of cash by 2015 then I suggest that maybe it starts by sacking the 54% of fake doctors who want a selective NHS and would leave patients to die because they've made a moral judgement on how they live their lives.
It was the start of summer vacation in 2010 when I’d run out of books to read. I dove into spending time with my boys and vegging at the pool daily.

When you're the majority and want to opress a minority, the easiest way is to let them know that their existence is provisional in the territory that you control. Israeli Arabs see that what was once the discourse of the most marginal elements in the society has now become mainstream; that what was once whispered is now unabashedly shouted; that the State is closing in on them with a growing arsenal of proposals to restrict their private property rights, to curtail their freedom of speech and conscience and even to "encourage" their emigration. It matters little that the projects are not enacted. The objective is that with each round of threats the Arabs will have to be thankful that the State deigned not to expel them this time.

In our barely dual-income family, she's the breadwinner and I'm the bread buyer. Circumstances reversed somewhat this summer, leaving my normally better-paid half with the need to occasionally help with my prior household duties, including the quest for food. So imagine my surprise when the woman I married, the one always quick to declare how she loathes shopping of all kinds, kept filling our home with crates of tomatoes and bushels of peppers, and buckets of ... well, I really don't know what those buckets of puce-colored things were.
The final story, also a Gaiman one, is ‘The Price’ (1998), in which a man finds a cat who comes every day to his house covered in bruises and cuts.

He discovers that each night the devil comes to his house, and the cat battles him, so that the man and his family might live in peace.

OK, so Clayton seems to be settling into a routine at school. I hope. He had another good day today. For those of you who commented that I should tell the teacher to leave me alone unless Clay lands on red, I don't agree. I want to know when he's acting up so I can help nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand. His teacher is very nice and she didn't come up to me in an angry or accusatory way at all. She was letting me know what went on in class and I appreciate it. Clay is bright and busy and thinks a little differently than the norm and I'd like to encourage that. I want him to keep his individuality; it's what makes him him. However, there's a time and place to explore that creativity and there's a time and place to conform and sit and listen to the teacher respectfully and keep one's hands to oneself. They're both important skills to develop.

In a hot pan coated with 1tbs olive oil cook the tofu until lightly browned on the outside, add the three kinds of peas and the garlic and basil. Cook until peas are bright green and cooked but still crisp. Add the peanut butter and stir. In a separate bowl mix the sauce ingredients. Pour over the stir fry and mix until incorporated with the peanut butter. Cook for 2-3 minutes until sauce thickens. If the sauce is too thick you can add a little more coconut milk. If the sauce is too thin you can add a little more peanut butter. Serve immediately over cooked rice, sprinkle chopped cashews over the top right before serving.
The proceedings yesterday marked a new chapter in the NFCorp controversy which arose after the Auditor-General’s 2010 Report highlighted the failure of the National Feedlot Centre to achieve its target, and which grew with revelations that the company had used the government-funded soft loan for purposes not related to cattle breed-ing.
Re: “the Father has entrusted all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.” We’re starting to get the Trinity thing more hashed out, now. Evidently Jesus is equal to God, not subordinate to him. And he clearly presents himself as a divine being, not just a prophet or an especially blessed human leader.
This is a small record measuring 2 1/2" in diameter that was put out by Mattel in 1971. There are a total of 9 players in the set and each player has two different versions of the disc.

I have both versions of the McCovey disc and chose to show the 2-sided version (the other version just has the green side).

Mostly I remember the freedom of her home. I remember sitting cutting out flowers and horses in the middle of her living room creating a mess that would have never been allowed in my own home. She urged creativity, she encouraged imagination and she didn’t mind the mess it made. Her words were encouraging and uplifting and when you needed to be brought to reality she did it with love and compassion.
A plot is a series of events, and events are transformations in situations. A film begins, and a situation is laid out for us, composed of parts like setting, character, desires, etc. Minor actions may occur, but an event transforms the balance of entities and forces in a film-situation. A character shifts from being good to bad, the world is rocked by an earthquake, a murder occurs, the situation changes. These are events, and we string them together into plots.

I think that they should not limit themselves to their own preconceptions of themselves, but should throw themselves out onto a blank page that they haven't written on yet, and see what they find out about their own selves, see what story unfolds, see what happens! I always do this, and sometimes it can be very frightening! To very often have a blank page with nothing written on it yet! I feel as though I am a soul with a single covering–my body of skin– and that's the only thing between me on the inside and the rest of the world! It's quite frightening to begin each day on a blank page, forgetting your own preconceptions of yourself and allowing your mind to embrace the new! It is like meeting yourself for the first time, over and over again!
Tokyo, Japan. Last year’s outdoor event got hit by a typhoon, but Metamorphose is back in Tokyo with a lineup that includes The Flaming Lips, the reformed ’90s electronic-dance due Orbital, along with Galaxy 2 Galaxy, Derrick May, Ebo Taylor and Afrobeat Academy, Moodymann and Tim Deluxe. (May 12)

Only in the last half-century or so have we been able to begin to find out. From the Russian Sputnik to the American Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, to the International Space Station, we’ve figured out how to escape the constraints of Earth’s gravity and actually see what really exists at the edge of our imagination.
Now… that is not half bad right? Instead of a recently painted winter camo model I had one that looked like it’s been campaigning for a couple of years. I’m cool with that, so with a rush of blind faith I carried on. My family passed near that table and saw that model transform so much over the course of a week.
As you can see, nothing but good can come out of this. If you think you may have it - I suggest you go and get tested.

Here's the thing though: it is a fallacy. Kids today are growing up even faster than we ever did, and pretending that isn't happening by forbidding things isn't addressing the real issue. Often the same parents squirming when their 10 year old watches anything rated above PG are the same ones getting their kids cell phones at the same age. Totally inconsistent.

Yesterday I did great!
Cream the sugar and butter in a bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the egg yolks and then the flour. At this point the dough will become dense and crumbly. If you have been using a stand mixer, now is the time to turn it off and mix in the walnuts, which you will have already chopped roughly, by hand. Then roll the dough into a log and wrap it and place it in the fridge or freezer to harden. It will need a couple of hours in the fridge.
I didn’t have a recipe scribbled down in my book so I improvised using a Devon apple cake recipe as a starting point. I think it needed more rhubarb, though the beloved said he liked it.
I just followed the directions here and I think I was able to put our first coat of stain on after a couples hours (can't really remember and I guess I'm too lazy to go read the can). We had obviously already decided that we didn't want the tops white like the rest of the desk so the we then had to decide what color stain to go with. We ruled out a light stain after testing out a piece with the pre-stain on it and ended up settling on Dark Walnut but really liked the Jacobean by Minwax (which we decided was a tad too dark).
You may recall the week I spent posting about the process of making this painting of Flannery O'Connor. You'll be happy to know I managed to eeeek out a 2nd place prize which involves actual money. It was the perfect reward; it left me the "best of show" to aspire to. It was an excellent exhibition 0f 143 pieces whittled down from 600 something. This year I got lucky with a judge that wasn't married to realism. The grand prize winner was way off the reservation. Big paintings are the way to go.
These shotgun loads can vary from light trap loads, which generally use a shorter 2-1/2" or 2-3/4" shell (or even 1-3/4" in some specialty loads), and launch relatively light loads of very small pellets at a moderate velocity to hit clay targets; to heavy 3.5" magnum slug loads, which launch a single very heavy projectile, at relatively high velocities, for hunting and personal defense.

Thanks for the Great blog. Something about myself. I have recently immigrated to a country were I had no job lined up or were I could not even speak the Language. To say that my first year was the most difficult time of my life would be a major understatement. I have now seemed to have crossed the largest hurdle, found a job and settled in. This is the sacrifice I had to make for my families freedom and survival. It saddens me however to read and hear about my beloved countries further decline into anarchy. I am therefore at a complete loss of words when the loved ones that remained behind have optimism for the future. What is this based on? Surely they are privy to the same information and news that I see and hear.

This year, I was in for a pleasant surprise. There was a sweet little antiques shop in an old gas station on the south end of town. It was open, I made a U-turn, parked and went inside. Amongst all the other “stuff” – a lot of it really nice – I found a sweet little curio cabinet.

I have been Bugging today. Last week I blogged about a project called 'Bugged' where the idea is to head out into the world, listen in on fellow humans, and use the overheard words as source materials for writing. The day for listening is today, so that's what I've been doing.

Hilda Ogden is an absolute travesty of a character. The fact that she was voted the greatest soap opera character ever in a Radio Times poll 17 years after her last appearance, was voted in 1982 the fourth most recognizable woman in Britain - topping Thatcher - and is generally one of Coronation Street’s most beloved characters is deeply, deeply upsetting.
BUENAS NOTICIAS – Yesterday we had a big storm in Northern California. I casually mentioned in the staff room that I needed new tires and low and behold, today there are two tire coupons in my box. I love my staff. Oh and did I mention I have an ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow! Whoo hoo!
This week we are covering numeration systems (section 3.2) Numerals are written symbols for numbers and a numeration system is a logically organzied collection of numerals. The acient egyptians used picture symbols to count called hieroglpyhics. This used things like a stick. heeled bone, coiled rope, and a pointed finger to account for numbers sich as 1, 10, 100, and 1,000.

As you know, Erik and I are in the process of adopting from Uganda (this is where this, non fiction book takes place). We are very serious about wanting to head back to Uganda annually with our children, to keep them involved in their culture, and to continually love on the people of Uganda. This is a goal in our lives, and we are serious about making this happen (God willing).

The MX330 all-in-one printer is a brand addition to my brand new home office! I have not had my own printer in 20 years, so this particular model was a real “eye opener” for me. I can remember when you could not touch an all-in-one machine for under 400.00! Times have definitely changed. But the question is, have they changed for the better?
Naturally after my proficiency was well established I told Sandy one afternoon after school. I told her about ejaculation and the incredibly good feeling that accompanied it. She was fascinated. Actually she was more than fascinated, she was consumed by the thought of it. During my explanation of what it felt and looked like she interrupted numerous times about the details of the event and the sensation. She became transfixed with the thought of my erect cock spewing cum; she had to see it.

Nothing makes waking up better than a fresh, hot kolache. However, these sausage rolls aren't only intended for mornings. Kolaches can be enjoyed any time of the day! I made these on a Friday evening so that breakfast would be all ready to go on Saturday morning.

Despite the doom and gloom of these titles, his discussion reveals a much more mixed bag and two countries of particular interest to me--Singapore and Israel-- serve as positive (though not perfect by any means) models of the potential for government involvement in entrepreneurship. It is these latter chapter from which I drew insight and inspiration in preparing my own public talk.

Sassy also got measured for her first dance recital costume. I AM SO EXCITED! I actually started to tear up when she was getting measured. I have always love music and dance (though I'm not really talented at either) and so to have my daughter show the same excitement for things that I love is so awesome. Of course I will support her and be her biggest (and let's face it, loudest) cheerleader in anything she pursues, but I'm really excited that she loves dance. We have random dance parties at our house at least once a week.

Anyways, I am sorry to those who have expected me to do something with YWMC/Normal/DNW/I will come up with a name for it someday. A lot of thinking has been done, but sadly, no writing. Thing is, I think little shreds of the old story still stuck to the plot for old time’s sake, but the matter was that they dragged the story down and made it seem silly. The plot points simply didn’t fit the characters’ personalities anymore. So I had to let go of some things that traveled with the story since it first started in 2004. So, saying goodbye was a bit rocky and rough, but the big girl panties had to be worn.
The past few weeks have been so crazy, I sometimes wonder if I’m caught inside an elaborate dream involving many hours at the baseball field or if I really am so busy parts of my day are a blur. I resorted to the one thing my mother always did that drove me crazy, T0-Do Lists! It gets worse, I have more than one! My purse has a collection of lists. I never thought I would end up this way…

My first 50 feet of the run I must have looked ridiculous, all hunched over and rocking from side to side up to the end of my street. Because of the soreness I couldn’t find a good pace. I went from 10:30 pace to 8:05 and back to 9:30. The whole run was like that. In the end I made it 7 miles and was thoroughly whipped by the finish. Good run that help get rid of the stress of the day and let me think through the problems that need to be resolved.

Anyway, one of the books I read this week was called Heaven is For Real by Todd Burpo with Lynn Vincent about a four-year old who undergoes a traumatic experience and almost dies. A few months after the whole experience the little boy, Colton starts talking about his experience meeting Jesus and going up to heaven. Slowly the family learns that Colton had a very unique experience when he was undergoing surgery, an experience that very few have.

"It is obvious the MacArthur's reliance on air power was almost absolute. Whatever the weaknesses of his ground forces, whatever their difficult and exposed positions, U.N. mastery of the skies was complete, and air would be the decisive arm. It was a typically American viewpoint. MacArthur and the men around him had a great deal to learn about Chinese Communist armies."
Every person must come to that point of conviction because of the bad news. The wages of sin is death. That is the bad news.

What effect did it have upon you in knowing that your sin condemned you?

Women in Vietnam wear Ao Dai in school, at hotels, on planes, at offices in companies, especially on important and formal occasions such as wedding, festivals and other national celebrations. And the white Ao Dai is regarded as the school uniforms of girls in senior high school. Vietnamese girls in Ao Dai at school look very beautiful. If you travel in Vietnam, you can see many young and hot Vietnamese girls in Ao Dai, no matter what they do. You buy them for your dating girlfriend, or as a souvenir. You can shop with tailors for materials and get recommendations from them. There are numerous Vietnam tailors who specialize in making excellent Ao Dai and they finish it in one day. Every outfit of Ao Dai fits well the figure of Vietnamese girls and you can ask a tailor to custom-make one. It is beautiful and attracting. Vietnam women themselves are beautiful and hot and classical and traditional Ao Dai make hotter and beautiful Vietnamese ladies.

The NETRA season doesn’t start til May so I decided to go down to Jersey to get some preseason practice. I went and raced the season opener Tri County Harescramble, down by Millville. It was a little chilly but otherwise perfect conditions. The race was delayed until 1:30 and then we took off. I was a little intimidated by the chaos at the start as 30+ bikes took off at once. I settled into about midpack and tried to keep up. I wasn’t doing very well and the course was very chopped out with whoops, whooped ruts, and chop everywhere. I had left my suspension settings alone, which were set up for rocky conditions, and that wasn’t helping either. I started getting vicious arm pump from a combination of nerves and getting beat up in the rough trails.

Standing in the security line, I check my pockets for my wallet, my keys and my phone. I hand over my ticket and my driver’s license, and get the nod that means I am not a threat to anyone. I am saddened by the sight of a line of people untying their shoes so that they can keep them on until last minute, while they un-stack grey bins and sort their belongings, tripping over the laces. I know that these X-ray machines were not, in fact, properly tested before they became part of Procedure. Studies found that bombarding passengers’ bodies with radioactive particles increases passengers’ risks of cancer. I watch as the family in front of me lines up their stroller and bottles and coats on the conveyor belt, and walks into the machine, which bombards them with radioactive carcinogenic waves. The father thanks the TSA man when he waves them on. Then I go through, knowing that I won’t die in a terrorist attack but might live to develop cancer. TSA waves me on.

There are many things to love about the color WHITE. For some, use of the color in their homes and wardrobe borders obsession, like that of the good friend of mine whom I wrote about in White By Design. That story has raised my antenna, ever on the lookout for extreme displays of white. It has inspired a series of White By Design stories, this being the 4th.

If you want to spread the word, sign the petition or whatever – well, I don’t see it can harm – and if it stops even a handful of children from wrecking their lungs, then that’s a win as far as I’m concerned.
Teens have been my passion since I taught back in the mid- 90's but I guess I always thought my connection with them was completely based on the fact that being right out of college, there weren't all that many years between us. But when my own children became tweens and the conversations would go from in front of the TV to around the kitchen table WITH ME... I realized they can sense how much I love them without me even having to do anything special. Just listen, be my goofy self and let them BE who they are.
The book was easy to read – the writing flowed and never got boring – at less than 200 pages, it didn’t have chance to. However, there were times when I felt that the author was second guessing what people were thinking. In one part, a young man is abusive to him, but his insults are never related to colour. Griffin presumes that this would not have happened if he were white, but the truth is that he and we cannot know whether this is correct or not. Other than this though, it is an interesting book which held my attention.

Anyway, I also want to tell you about Teen Titles. It's a remarkable magazine, which began its life in Edinburgh and is still produced here, funded by the Edinburgh City Council, but you'll find it in schools all across the UK now. Its selling point is that every single review is written by a teenage reader and all the interviews are done by teenage readers. Since the whole magazine is reviews and interviews, this means that the entire content is provided by teenagers.

I never posted about my Thanksgiving baking creation. I made Libby's Sour Cream Pumpkin Bundt Cake. It was....ehhhhhh. Unremarkable. Probably because (a) the taste was reminiscent of a spice cake I ate for my last breakfast in Israel when I was 12 1/2, which I promptly threw up due to airsickness from Tel Aviv to Heathrow to New York...as in I THREW UP FOR THE ENTIRETY OF BOTH FLIGHTS, and (b) it did not look like the picture! The streusel sank to the bottom (rose to the top when I flipped it over), so it did not have that tunnel o'streusel taste I was hoping for.

Father: "Speaking of school, a counselor called last week to ask why you didn't respond to the letter they sent. I told them I didn't know of any letter, which apparently, pertains to you failing all the classes you took this semester. They called again yesterday. We discussed your grades and the tuition check I sent last month. They wanted to know if they should send it back, or just run it through the paper shredder. I told them the paper shredder was fine. They thanked me for saving them the cost of a stamp and asked about your dorm room. I was a little confused until they explained they haven't seen much of you, needed a place for an Indian pre-med student, so we worked out a deal. They'll pro-rate the time it was used and send me a check for the difference. Since I'm cutting costs, it was too sweet of a deal to ignore."

I recently connected with a friend of mine whom I hadn’t seen in forever. She has had a challenging life living with diabetes and then renal failure. Over lunch, she informed me that just two years ago she got a new kidney, followed by a donated pancreas six months later. Her account of what it was like going from living with chronic organ failure to all of the sudden “healthy” was absolutely amazing. How do you let go of checking your blood sugar multiple times a day? And how do you accept that you can now eat things that you couldn’t eat before? And what do you do with your newfound freedom when you realize you are not stuck to a dialysis schedule?

So last year my daughter’s creche was under threat of closing, as the owner was emigrating and my husband and I were unsure of what to do. After scouting several creches, we settled on a wonderful little creche that was a bit more expensive and a little further out. So at the end of December I forked out the January fees, a lump in my throat when I clicked ‘pay’ on the internet banking. Oh, this excludes the not-so-small non-refundable deposit I paid in October.
Anna behaved like an angel for most of the day. That is, until 30 seconds prior to meeting Santa. Core melt-down time began, and mommy stress was through the roof. I can’t say as I blame my child. I mean, we were there for two hours before we got to see Santa. She had played on every toy, begged for every piece of candy in the store, ran around and had her fun. Since she takes after me when she gets hungry, my sweet child turns into Sybil on speed.

And although there have been several KALs on the Itty Bitty forums, I don’t think I’ve ever done them at the same time.

Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee, Ph.D., is a Sufi teacher and author of a number of books, including “The Return of the Feminine and the World Soul.” In recent years the focus of his writing and teaching has been on spiritual responsibility in our present time of transition and the emerging global consciousness of oneness, and the subject of spiritual ecology. He is the founder of the Golden Sufi Center. His most recent book is “Fragments of a Love Story, Reflections on the Life of a Mystic.”
Paleolithic humans foraged from hundreds of species of wild (unhybridized) plants that grew in rich soils that had never been farmed (let alone farmed with pesticides and herbicides). In modern society, the best you can hope to achieve is to eat all or mostly organically grown plants of maybe a few dozen varieties, most of which have been hybridized over generations to maximize appearance, size and calories rather than nutrition, and farmed on the same land over and over. Even with the best organic farming practices, minerals don’t just appear from nowhere…. Soil loses some of its punch with every crop unless some artificial or natural process replenishes the minerals (volcanoes, glaciers, etc.). In short, even the best of modern food isn’t anything like what our pre-agricultural forbears ate, and to get adequate levels of some nutrients, you’d have to eat more food than is humanly possible. Supplements are, quite literally, part of the cure for modernity.

Anyway, that's it for 2008. Thanks to everyone who has stopped in and read what I have to say here this year — ESPECIALLY if you've been commenting. I love a lively discussion and have really appreciated everyone who's taken the time to debate and dissect a film, or simply to say hi. Happy new year to everyone out there. I may have a few reviews in the next couple of days, but the blog will definitely be back on its regular near-daily posting schedule come January 5, and don't forget that the Early Howard Hawks blog-a-thon starts on January 12!

An F1 car is a complex vehicle, a lot of emphasis is placed on the things we can see, the wings and bodywork. Sometimes we can talk about less visible items such as engine, gearboxes, suspension or even electronics. But perhaps the least visible and detailed part of the car is the underbody. The floor and diffuser, that together create nearly half the cars downforce, for almost no drag. Underbody aerodynamics have been the key to F1 car’s ever faster laptimes. All we ever see of the underbody is the exit of the diffuser and sometimes, if seen from a low angle, the step under the cars floor. To aid explanations in my other articles on underbodies, I have summarised and simplified what the underbody consists of.

And the dear friends of mine who (like my mom for ten years before adopting me) are facing infertility.

Matthew got out and opened her driver's side door for the last time, collecting CDs, old key rings, papers...finally her dented license plate. A Journey CD played on my van's radio as I watched him and cried. I was remembering life with Betsy - remembering lunch dates to our favorite Chinese restaurant when Matthew and I were first dating, remembering late night conversations and kissing sessions beneath her sun roof that lay open to the stars as her radio serenaded us, remembering carefree trips to San Antonio's River Walk when we were first married without kids, and recalling longer trips to New Mexico and Idaho when her interior was so crammed with kiddie stuff and luggage and Christmas gifts, there was barely room for us and our kids to move. Though the kids and I had long since moved our mobile selves from Betsy to the roomier minivan, I was remembering our life thus far in that sporty little car and how it had unfolded, and I was mourning her future absence from it.

The two of them together reminded me of the famous scene from the movie “Big” with Tom Hanks playing the giant floor keyboard in FAO Schwartz. Hanks has a duet with the store employee, and the scene is charming. Watching my husband and daughter play their duet to me last night was just as charming, so I thought it’d be the perfect song today. The “Big” scene actually includes both “Heart and Soul” and “Chopsticks,” so you get a two for one song of the day today, blog readers. I hope the scene makes you smile and gives you some happiness on your Sunday. Enjoy!

Our slow cooker is so small that I couldn't fit the chicken carcass in at first (it was frozen). I put it on the stove for a few hours and then transferred it to the slow cooker. I cooked the first batch for 24 hours, removed most of the broth and then added more water. I cooked the second batch another 24 hours. After the second batch, the bones easily crumbled when I pinched them, so I decided to call it quits. I was pleased that we were able to double our normal supply of chicken broth from one set of bones.

I used to write him and visit him so often, we had our own sort of language and ways of communicating which only we could understand. Abbreviations in our writing and references in our speech so that we could communicate freely when we needed to.... They are always monitored and watched and the tables are quite close to one another in the visiting "park". Some subjects are just off limits to others and so we had our ways of making privacy. Since the birth of Harley and the crash of the economy, I only get up to see him 3-5 times a year... (It is 4 hours round trip), and writing has become sporadic at best. It's hard when someone is still as important to you as they ever were, but you simply have so many demands on your time and attention and energy in the present right in front of you that your behavior would tell them otherwise. That said, we had a marvelous visit full of laughs and some tears. The men there are experiencing really hard times as the admin has totally changed thanks to our delightful governor. They are being mistreated and picked on constantly, but that's another story for another time. So I spent my whole day there eating bad canteen food and drinking freeze dried coffee. The best part is the pop corn. It's so buttery gross it's good! Really good!
Howard Stern? I did not know the guy, but somehow I remembered his movie poster for his movie Private Parts, and he seemed like an arrogant bastard who had his ego way too high up in his head.

When she came too she felt sick, her head was pounding, her clothes were covered in blood and when she looked at her hands, a sob escaped her lips, she remembered her brother lying there in a pool of his own blood. She tried to block out the image, but her mind was not letting her. She started shivering and the burly man tried to put something around her. That’s when she realized what was happening. She was on the floor, but this was not her home, she was on a ship. She started to get up but could not, her feet were chained to the floor, she turned her gaze around, tried to look up but her eyes did not want to focus. The burly man was by her side holding a big piece of cloth, a shoal of sorts. There was a storm coming he said, she understood him, and let him put the big piece of cloth over her.

In other words, the prosperity of German manufacturers has come at the price of a decade of wage cuts (adjusted for inflation) suffered by German workers. Sound familiar? Reduced income leads to reduced consumption, so exports account for a steadily rising portion of German gross domestic product. In relative terms, it becomes more difficult for other European Union countries to compete with German products, particularly in other countries using the euro, because German manufacturers increasingly can undercut them. Manufacturing capacity elsewhere is shuttered, reinforcing German dominance and increasing unemployment in the countries on the receiving end of the exports.

During a meandering walk, I noticed how thoughts naturally distill into ideas. In their own intangible ways, untethered musings become fruitful. Though not visibly productive, an adventure is in progress. Words, images, and aspirations are forming with each step. Consequently, thirsting for wisdom and insight proceeds as a continuing pursuit. One might not consider such studies necessary, but I’ve found learning to be vital, satisfying, and useful. As pilgrimage travels are beyond the perfunctory, so contemplative reading is far too compelling to be burdensome. Essentially, the whole of life’s advancement comprises different forms of research. Enjoyable reading and inquiry generates momentum, and I am able to find the narrow passages through thinly-sliced schedules. Such pilgrimage is a worthwhile continuum of construction and refinement.

This is the point where you realize that stone-skipping is actually a pretty established hobby. Stone-skipping enthusiasts even organize competitions (check out http://stoneskipping.com/ for details on the 43rd annual Stone-Skipping Tournament). The world record right now is an amazing 51 skips. Yes. Fifty-one (as opposed to my all-time high of zero). The person who set the record is a guy named Russ Byars, and his website even gives you tips on how to get the perfect skip. The man is a professional. Watch this footage of Russ Byars setting the world record, and see if you can actually count the 51 skips (and have fun doing that! ). In any case you just have to admit there’s something awesome about the way the stone just keeps skipping…

Anyways, this treat can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike! I am very interested in finding ways to reduce the amount of processed food that I buy at the grocery store. While we don’t buy granola bars all the time, they are good to have on hand for a quick snack when time is short. I am obsessed with these chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels found at the bulk barn, so this recipe really caught my eye. The peanut butter-pretzel combo is almost magic.

Suffice it to say, my silence has been for a reason. And that reason is sound.
So I've decided to take a break from it all. Blogging, Flickr, Google Reader... For the most part of April, I'll be on an Internet holiday. I wasn't going to have much time for it, anyway, as I have a busy week of work ahead of me, 10 days of holiday back in Spain (aka wedding planning madness!), and a lot to catch up on afterwards. I'm not making any rules, I may pop up from time to time, but I'm giving myself permission not to.
“Authenticity and transparency, aka honesty and truthfulness, are the new communication standards for the future,” said Sara Roberts, co-author of Light Their Fire and president/CEO of Roberts Golden, an organizational change consulting firm. “In a WikiLeaks era, privacy is an elusive goal. While it’s always been unbecoming and costly to be caught in a lie, the risk of false or partial disclosure is even greater now. The discovery of the truth can be accomplished in the push of a button. Honesty is a good policy not just because we’re forced to do it in this Internet era, but also because telling the truth demonstrates respect for one’s audience and gains people’s trust.

A commenter on the last Grits post suggested that a key reason the number of traffic tickets written by Texas police went down last year in Austin and elsewhere may have been cuts to the "Selective Traffic Enforcement Program" (STEP), which are federal pass-through grants distributed to law enforcement through the Texas Department of Transportation to pay for overtime devoted to traffic enforcement. And indeed, that may partially, but not fully, explain the recent decline in traffic tickets written by Texas police.

I’m starting off with something a little different than most of what is posted on the blog, generally, the brand new single from Linkin Park. I was actually a really big fan of Linkin Park’s when their first album came out but became less and less into their music with each album they released so after the long break they have been on I was really curious about how I would feel about what they came back with. If I’m being completely honest, while the song is catchy and enjoyable enough, it’s kind of the same old thing they were doing before going away at all, which is kind of boring. Like I said, I do enjoy this song but as a next step for Linkin Park, and as a “comeback” single, I think it falls very short.
So many favourite characters: Dick Swiveller, Betsy Trotwood, Flora Finching, Peggotty, Mr Jingle - every book yields up a gem or two.

"Who? What?"
Germany is often cited as the lead country in Europe for renewables and if that country is having massively to add to its coal-fired generation – and import electricity - despite having nearly 30GW of wind capacity, any idea that we can do differently with less than a fifth of the wind capacity seems to be fantasy.
I remember sitting down one day, totally exhausted and not ready at all to have my second child but by then he was ready to come soon. I opened up God’s word and he spoke to me and told me not to fear, that he will take hold of me by His hand. What an encouragement that was for me.

6. Health. My 70-year-old coach still gets on the ice to demonstrate certain skating elements when he’s coaching. You’d never guess he was that old if you met him. He has so much energy. My grandparents, by comparison, are the same age as my coach and have multiple health problems (not all of which can be attributed to a lack of exercise or nutrition but some of which can). Skating is such a unique form of exercise because you’re in constant motion. Even when you’re hardly moving, just standing, gliding, and balancing on skates causes your whole body to work on keeping you balanced, which strengthens your core. When you skate, even at a low level or speed, your core is working, your legs–from your hips down to your feet–are working, your arms are working, and your cardiovascular system is pumping. Just 45 minutes of this can burn about 350 calories, according to WebMD’s Fit-O-Meter. And 45 minutes of a higher level of skating and momentum can burn as much as 600 calories! I would much rather spend 45 minutes learning to do new things on the ice without realizing I’m working my whole body than spend the same amount of time on a boring workout machine at a gym. It’s definitely true that the times of my life when I have been most fit and healthy have been when I’ve been skating regularly. And now that I’m trying to lose weight again, it’s time to pinch my pennies so that I can afford extra ice time to keep toning my body.

I really had good intentions of uploading videos of my favorite ways to wear my baby/toddler when I got back from Idaho last week, but we ran into a small problem... My hubby left his memory card in his parents computer in Idaho.

Eve Latour is a former Olympic champion biathlete (perhaps loosely reminiscent of our own Silken Laumen) who, in a stunning display of personal courage, won her event and a place in the heart of the world, while competing on a broken ankle. Eight years, however, have passed, and, much to the disappointment of her long-time boyfriend Nick, it seems, she has done little to capitalize on her celebrity status. At Nick’s insistence she has agreed to meet with executives at Double Vision, a firm interested in marketing her image but her enthusiasm for the venture is underwhelming at best. Despite her high public profile Eve is very much alone at this junction in her life. In the interim since her Olympic triumph, her foreign correspondent father has been killed in the field, her beloved but troubled younger brother Ali has disappeared into the drug subculture of the city, and she has begun to suspect that her partner Nick may be more devoted to her celebrity than to her soul. Her isolation has reinvigorated her search for her brother, whose last known connections had been with the shadowy underground street art movement.

My boys’ adolescent years once again welcomed their participation mostly with the encouragement from their father telling them to “help your mother” but it inevitably became a family project by turning off the TV and playing holiday music. I must have been on the “nice” list these years. Thank you, Santa.

So, I have been feeling a bit beat down as far as teaching is concerned. Not because of recent yearbook-gate troubles but because of the draining feeling that comes with having about 100 apathetic students that seem to want to major in apathy when they leave high school. It is a bit trying. This is the first year out of my measly eight years of teaching that I have seriously wanted to walk away and change careers which of course is one of the reasons why I started blogging.

I loved the Fern family dynamic, Clare’s brother Perry (who I think is wonderful) is going through a tough time in this book and I was so surprised by him hiding this fact from his family.

I guess you want to know about the incident, the random event on a London Underground station? I had travelled from Edinburgh, where I live, to London for my first ever business-trip, first public-speaking event. (I was a dyslexia specialist then.) I'd done the event and my head was spinning; I was high on adrenaline and seeing things in a brighter light. For some reason which I will never understand, I decided to take a different underground route from the obvious one. So, I was on an escalator at Charing Cross station, when I should have been at Victoria.

So I settled down to read the Philosopher's Stone, which I haven't read for quite a while.

“Because,” Mr. Think said, “I was up at the stream this morning and I saw him there. His eyes were bright with malice. I know a look of territorial rivalry when I see one.

Nibras winced at the reminder of how evil Sharshar could get. He was also impressed that Mr. Think had figure that out already.

Today is the statistical peak for White-crowned Sparrows. Blue-headed Vireos peaked yesterday, and Lincoln Sparrows will peak by Friday. All statistically of course.

Ideas will pop into my head and if they seem interesting, I’ll write them down for future reference. If one won’t leave alone, I’ll jot a few scenes, a few possible characters. If the idea starts to be look promising, I’ll see if an outline can be completed. I’ll note points of future research, questions to ask certain people. Then I’ll start thinking about character profiles, maybe a subplot. After that’s completed, it’s time to start chapter one.

I tried to create a new banner picture for my Facebook page of all my grandbabies in birth order. I don't have any early pictures of Isaiah on my computer so his was of his first birthday. Unfortunately, FB didn't upload the photo the way I wanted to so I'm back to the drawing board on it. They are (in birth order) Isaiah (Amy's), Alexander (Shaun's), Kaitlyn (Shaun's), Zachary (Shaun's), Anna (Amy's), and Tristan (Shaun's newest). It's amazing how much alike Shaun's boys look. Except for Isaiah, these are all their "coming home" photos. I had one of Kaitlyn in her car seat, too but the toys hanging down pretty much blocked her face. She is such a beautiful child with long dark hair. All of the kids are beautiful (I'm not just prejudiced, either - lol - much). It's hard to tell in the picture but Tristan was the heaviest of all the kids at 8 lbs 6.5 oz and 21 inches. Isaiah was a little over 7 pounds and 20.5 inches. I don't remember Anna's weight (I think she was close to 7 pounds) but she was only 19 inches long. Shaun's other babies were all right at 6 lbs and a few ounces - and 19 inches long.

Growing up, lipstick always symbolized glamour and adultness to me, and until now, every time I've put it on I have felt like a little girl playing with her mother's makeup. Now I'm the mother, and have realized that wearing something so bold is much more a matter of attitude than anything objective. I might bust out the cowboy boots, too.

Cool, huh? Ian had really been playing with the melody. Nod your head to the beat of the old rehearsal songs and you can match. The last verse is a little different, but still. I was quite impressed and happy when I found this. But it's really sad, how the band pretty much just up and abandoned the song after those two rehearsal takes. Peter Hook is even quoted as saying they never finished the song, so likely there's not some old unused song from like the 'Unknown Pleasures' sessions, or even another rehearsal take or anything...
I won't deny the charges - I am a "patriotard" who rah-rahs for America, land of the free and home of the brave.

I like hearing about Washington's cherry tree, Paul Revere's ride, our military history, and our global preeminence. Yes, I really do love this country and feel lucky that I was born here.

One of my most beautiful journeys ever was on a bus (12 hours!) from Zagreb to Dubrovnik in Croatia – it was like travelling through postcards of Croatia’s stunning landscape. There were forests and streams straight from a Grimm Brothers’ fairy tale, wide scrubby plains and hillsides that brought to mind the Byzantines, and craggy coastlines falling away into sapphire waters. And one hell of a driver – he wound his way through winding mountain roads swiftly and smoothly, no jerky turns and brakes.

Many studies of people treated for elevated blood pressure with medications have shown that when blood pressure is reduced below a certain level, risk of serious trouble (heart attacks, strokes and deaths) will increase.4-15 This relationship is referred to as a “J-shaped” curve. Meaning: lowering the pressure to a certain point is beneficial (that is the first part of the “J” shape), but beyond that point, the patient is harmed (the second part of the “J”) when the pressure is lowered further toward “normal.” This phenomenon is found with both systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) pressure changes.

He told me there was a new doctor interested in starting medical missions in earnest who leaving for Haiti that very day and that he had some nurses interested too. He said that both of them are two busy to promote and administer such a project but with my background and experience they wanted to discuss the endeavor with me. They also wanted me to promote regular Mexico missions with social media, the church website and anything else I would have time for and wanted to know when I was free to discuss the idea over lunch.

I can be wrong. Very wrong.
Sir Terry Prachett was one of the first fantasy authors I read with a passion. I was perhaps twelve, when a friend of mine gave me Equal Rites and Hogfather and told me to give them a shot. She did not make a misjudgement – I did like Discworld, as soon as I got the hang of it (which I still maintain takes a couple of books). For a couple of years I read whatever translated Discworld novels I could find from the library, but all too soon I realised there were no more translations available. So, at the age of fourteen, I wandered to the English shelves at the bookstore and picked up Good Omens, mostly because I had read a lot about it online and because it said ‘Pratchett’ on the cover. My English was not good and I understood very little, and around page 80 I gave up.
Anna is a wonderful character, impossible to dislike and you'll find yourself rooting for her from page one, just like I did. She's a little awkward and clumsy but not in the ridiculously annoying Bella Swan fashion, she's just a regular girl who makes the same stupid mistakes as the rest of us, which makes it so easy to like her. St Clair, too, is flawed enough to make him feel like a real person, rather than a two dimensional heart throb who has very little going for him, besides good hair. He has his ups and downs and I loved witnessing the struggle between St Clair, Anna and St Clair's girlfriend, Ellie.

After two days of snorkeling and swimming inside the marine park, I headed off on my own to Ras Mbisi Lodge. Hailing one of a handful of the 4x4 taxis that ply the island’s dirt roads, I reached the thatched-roof compound after a bumpy, 40-minute drive.
I started with a pink bazzill base and layered with white and some Hey Birdie DSP. The next panel is more white (punched on one end with the Lacy Days of Summer border punch) and topped with more Hey Birdie DSP. Across the middle is some lighter pink bazzill (I actually embossed it with Swiss Dots - not that you can see it now!) and topped with some white crochet ribbon. I stamped the image in Memento Tuxedo Black onto X-press It Blending Card and coloured with Copics (R81, R83, R85, R89, G20, G21, G24, Y11, Y21, Y23, E31, E000, E01, 0) and cut out with Small Circle Nestabilities and matted with pale pink (large circle nestabilities) and dark pink (big scallop circle nestabilities) and popped it all up on X-press It Foam Mounting Tape. Next I stamped the sentiment and cut it out as a notched tag, curving it a bit and added a foam butterfly (thanks to my dear friend Michelle) to the end and finally I finished by adding pink rhinestones to the butterfly and flowers of the image.
Then a few nights later I had decided to put her to sleep on her back. Well I usually put her to sleep on her side and I guess she didnt like laying on her back so she rolled over to her side, and with out her usually side-laying props, she managed to fall onto her stomach. I woke up to a baby sleeping face down and it gave me a heart attack (not literally of course but Im sure you can imagine my panic) but she was fine.
Children who feel out of control will act out of control. Some of this can't be helped. Their little bodies are quite out of control as they go through age three. So, we must expect some erratic behaviors. But, if they don't have bumpers to keep them safe, their out of control bodies will have more destructive crashes. So, let them know that you have expectations. Let them know that you will not allow them to harm others. That you will not allow them to be unsafe. They need to know that you are there for them. That you are stronger and bigger than their out of control bodies, and you can keep them safe, even when they don't feel they can keep themselves safe.

The belief in the power of water from mineral springs diminished in the 20th century, but unlike many such places, Eureka Springs preserved its beautiful atmosphere and architecture. It stands today as one of the most beautifully preserved Victorian towns in the world. The romance of days gone by is unmistakable and the town offers beautiful historic accommodations, restaurants, shops and entertainment. Carriages roll through the streets and couples walk hand in hand along the sidewalks.

So much so for the hypocritical and disgraceful Liberal Democrats who supported NO2ID against the imposition if ID cards and its campaign to retain our personal freedom. When it comes to the supporting its EU, as far as the Labour, Tories and Liberal Democrats go, all principals and election promises go out of the window.
The sad thing about survival is this: If you're lucky you get old. If... you're lucky! In Hollywood is it perhaps better for your legend's longevity to not get this lucky? Marlene Dietrich and Garbo both retreated into exile to spare their fans the shocking Baby Jane-in-the-mirror moment (Dietrich performed into her 70s before retiring, however, but she still kept it tight). Marilyn Monroe perhaps knew that if she took her life at least her fans would have what they always wanted--an immortal Aphrodite for the icon-stellation--and she could finally get some real sleep.

This book is a great alternative to a textbook when teaching about precipitation. The language is simple but it's full of important vocabulary words and even contains a useful glossary at the end. The photography is also spectacular, from super magnified snowflakes to a forest destroyed by acid rain. I prefer this book to a textbook because it details all states of precipitation, notably in their extreme forms. The language, photographs, and fun facts help make this book a great introduction to this topic for young students.

The Toronto Star editorialized on the matter in today's issue oblivious to the fact that the pro mass-immigration agenda it promotes in its pages plays a major role in youth employment. It opts instead to shift blame to the government for making cut backs to services that it assumes will undermine the employment prospects of Canada's young. The paper is right to blame the government but for the wrong reason because mass immigration is the problem and if the government should be making cut backs anywhere it is in the number of immigrants this country receives each year.
In 1782 Nancy had become separated from her husband due to cruelty and was surprisingly well educated for a woman of her time. When Burns became the toast of Edinburgh in 1787 she was determined to meet him. There was quite a spark between the two, leading to a lengthy correspondence. Unfortunately Nancy and Robert had slightly different ideas about how the relationship should continue. Burns would rather it was a bit earthier and eventually he found what he wanted below stairs - Nancy's servant Jenny Clow had a child to him in 1888.

Unfortunately, although it may work, it works inconsistently. There's a real fine line between "not cold enough" and "everything freezing solid." It has a freezer just barely big enough to hold two ice cube trays, and, despite its ability to freeze lettuce on the bottom shelf, it can't manage to prevent a pint of ice cream that's actually in the freezer from turning to soup. It also takes up more than its fair share of floor space in a camp that's not especially big. Considering that the amount of usable space inside the thing isn't much bigger than a dorm fridge, it's massive (it easily takes up as much space as a modern 15-cubic foot fridge, but has barely 6 cubic feet of interior space) and, the one reason someone is willing to haul it away, it sucks up a lot of electricity when it's being used.

Knowledge is the first step I suppose. My goal is to be a well-rounded pilot, which means being able to glide effortlessly between tandems, solo, acro, cross-country...whatever the case may be. My transitions definitely need work, but at least now I know what I need to focus on. Today looks like a good opportunity - my friend may have a tandem for me and then after I can free-fly and as the wind is forecast to pick up later there may be a chance to practice some acro. Nothing like trying to fix everything at once!

Mainstream, traditional flipped-classroom advocates would have students doing their ‘homework’ in class time, assisted by their teacher who is now untethered from the whiteboard and able to work one-to-one with students, each completing individual self-paced work. It does make sense. If they are going to be completing individual homework anyway, this is better than doing so alone at night when there is no help available when they are stuck.

Recently, I received a letter from a woman who lives locally who follows my blog. She wondered if I had ever heard of "Circle Letters" and if so, why I hadn't written about them. She said she would have been rather surprised if I hadn't heard of them. Well, folks, I hadn't heard of them. Had no idea what she was talking about. She offered to explain it in an email but I was even more confused so I went to her home so that she could show me a Circle Letter and explain it to me in layman's terms. I have attempted to explain it since and I just seem to go around in circles, kind of like the Circle Letter. I pulled this explanation straight off the internet from here:

What we were asked to do was simply to remain in the present, be silent and observe across the day, for just under six hours. We took breaks every hour and had a lunch break. And so the hours passed, with each of us trying to remain in the now, not wander off in our own thoughts, but let the day pass. And it did pass, serenely, quietly - the Hugh Lane has the sort of acoustics you get in a church or cathedral, which I thought lent a sort of 'holy' quality to the day.
A particularly moving moment of the evening included volunteers sharing their experiences as LCNV tutors and talking about the bonds they have formed with their students. The event ended joyously with full bellies, and children sent home with a book.

If you were to attempt to make a gripping drama about the day-to-day struggles that come with living at an SS run concentration camp during the Great Patriotic War, how would you start things off? Some might open on a small patch of flowers flourishing next to an electrified fence–you know, try to capture the dichotomy between the beauty of nature and the scourge that is manufactured oppression. Others might cut to the chase and opt for a closeup shot of a swastika flag gently flapping in the midday sun. Well, the director of the justifiably infamous Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS doesn't care what you think, as he has decided that a side view shot of some mild commandant straddling followed by some not-so mild castration is the best way kick off your concentration camp movie. Right then and there, you know this film isn't going to about illuminating the populace about the ills of Nazism, a discredited movement whose sole appeal was that they had cooler uniforms than their drab enemies. Particularly Karl Diebitsch and Walter Heck's all-black SS uniform, manufactured by Hugo Boss. Utilizing the well-worn: titillate then repulse method of exploitation filmmaking, director Don Edmonds (Tender Loving Care) seems to revel in causing your aroused feelings to quickly turn into one's of revulsion and disgust. Having us cheering on a man's genitals to plunge as far as they can vaginally go one minute, only to have us wincing uncontrollably a mere ten seconds later when those very genitals are unceremoniously removed without even as much as a half-hearted auf Wiedersehen was a tad jarring.

The bottle on the left is, I think, as close as you can get to a commercially available home brew, Bière Brassèe à la Maison. The female brewer has supposedly turned her bathroom into a brewery, called Brasserie La 42ème. Except for the location in a village near the Wallonian capital of Namur, little is known about this microbrewery. The beer turned out a bit too spiced, but by all means drinkable ( and far from being a candidate for my bathroom zink!)

There are two major types of pension plans. The first—the kind that RBC offered its employees until this year—is called a defined benefit pension, or DB plan. Thanks to the pooling of funds among contributors and beneficiaries of different ages and retirement dates, members are insured against retirement savings risks, and then some. Long before they retire, members know what kind of monthly payments they’re going to receive. The employer guarantees it.

I followed the cold breeze to the front door. It was wide open. I had entered the house through the garage. WHO LEFT THE FRONT DOOR WIDE OPEN? Just as I was deciding whether to flee out the front door or run back in and rescue my iPhone boyfriend and iPad goddess from the clutches of a probable serial killer, I saw the UPS truck pull away from the curb. And then I noticed that just inside the front door was a package from Amazon. Oh, good, the book my daughter wanted had arrived. Putting two and two together I realized that the UPS guy put the book inside of the house and yelled, “HELLOOOOO?” because the front door was wide open.

Tom Sawyer wraps up just before 9pm. These kids, I can tell, worked damn hard and they deserve the applause from the small crowd. I gather our things and run for the door. In the car I ask the Chatterbox what she thought of it. ‘I dunno,’ is her reply. I explain how Tom Sawyer is a mischievous, misunderstood boy who does a good thing at the end – he saves someone’s life by being brave and telling the truth. I sense I’m not getting through. I change tack. ‘He’s a bit like the Raging Bull,’ I say. ‘A bit naughty sometimes, but a good person.’ She seems to accept this. I don’t explain that, unlike Tom Sawyer, the Bull has not yet learned the value of telling the truth.

I’m sure that there were some that said that Vautier’s Total Art was not art at the time that he created it. That it would later hang in a renown museum is still probably an art travesty to some, although the day that I was at MOMA last October, these works, hung in what is essentially a hallway at the top of an escalator between two galleries, stopped most people. I didn’t poll the visitors to get their opinions, although I did observe several trying to translate to be sure that they understood the words. That many tried to understand the words suggests to me that they were trying to understand the work. It makes one think about the artifact, about the work, about the concept, about the nature of art.

Bravo to all who wrote with such grace and elegance on this difficult subject. If you have yet to visit Basir's website (he is the contributing photographer for this day's prompt) I encourage you to view not only the beauty of his photography but the haunting views of his country that are often difficult to accept. This photo of a religious icon with its eyes shot out I found took my breath away. Some of you may find this article on CNN helps to understand the context of the photo - http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/05/10/afghan.buddhas/index.html - while I did not chose one of his photos of the empty holes in the cliff where the Buddhas once graced this valley, this image also captures the hatred the Taliban seems to revel in for their own country's culture.

Amidst the typical morning rush I happened to notice that the counter held a toothbrush which suspiciously resembled Boy's. A second glance told me there was no toiletries bag, but his deodorant kept the stray toothbrush company. Hmmm. I consoled myself that deodorant at just-12 isn't a necessity especially since 3/4 of the time would be spent in the water of the Florida Keys, and he had money enough to buy a new toothbrush as well as a souvenir.
For instance I am somewhat unconvinced that social anxiety disorder is a distinct category in of itself as oppossed to a component of another psychological issues. Be it generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or the like: in some cases I wonder if it would be more appropriate to classify it in terms of a social phobia. However I am always open to re-evaluating my position on this or any other diagnostic cateogry in the light of evidence. I would also stress that I don’t doubt that there is a highly distressing condition that has an huge impact on individuals daily lifes – just that I think it’s part of a wider disorder than a distinct seperate one.
Britain has produced a range of remarkably gifted multidisciplinary scientists and scholars who are sometimes described as polymaths. The group included, in recent times, Bertrand Russell, A. N. Whitehead, J. B. S. Haldane, J. D. Bernal, and Jacob Bronowski. Russell commented that the development of such gifted individuals required a childhood period in which there was little or no pressure for conformity, a time in which the child could develop and pursue his or her own interests no matter how unusual or bizzare. Because of the strong pressures for social conformity both by the government and by peer groups in the United States -- and even more so in the Soviet Union, Japan, and the People's Republic of China -- I think that such countries are producing proportionately fewer polymaths ....

As for the stuff that I didn’t like . . . well, I watched a lot of crap this year. I’m going to let some of the direct-to-DVD stuff like The Lazarus Project slide, because no one expects anything from movies like that. And though I saw BOTH Mr. Brooks and The Number 23 this year, I can’t say that they were the worst things I watched, because, like the remake of The Wicker Man, they’re just too funny to hate. However, the latest Body Snatchers movie, The Invasion, was both dull and angry-making, due to the complete cop-out at the end. And I intensely disliked The Darjeeling Limited, production values be damned, because Anderson’s little-boy-lost oeuvre has really started to grate. But for sheer worst of the year? The movie I most likely wouldn’t watch again if you paid me to? National Treasure: Book of Secrets managed to be boring, moronic, entirely too long, and a career low for Helen Mirren. La vie en rose frustrated me so much that I still can’t quite believe I watched the whole thing. But neither of these takes last place, because this year we had the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise. Officially, hands-down, my least favorite movie of the year. Worse than Lost Boys 2!

Curt graduated high school in 1978, back when gas was $0.63 a gallon and “Grease” & “Saturday Night Fever” were most popular on the big screen. That same year, Illinois Bell Company introduced the first ever Cellular Mobile Phone System; something that Curt probably didn’t realize he’d be tied to in the future. So at this time, he stuck to his trade as a mechanic. Curt had been a mechanic since age 13 because his dad owned 5 gas stations and he was always exposed to the automotive field.

If we understand that there is more than one god, then there is really no sovereign God. God, if He is to be God at all, by necessity is all powerful, all knowing, and in complete control of the universe. If there were two or more gods, one would possess power and knowledge not held by the other or the many—an idea that negates either as God. The Mormon belief in many gods demon­strates what can happen when one accepts biblical passages that speak of God’s plu­rality, but denies verses that set forth God’s unity. The Trinity of orthodox Chris­tians, which takes into consideration the full counsel of God, is the only logical way to reconcile both kinds of verses.

Since the fall of the military dictatorship in 1974, Greek politics has been dominated by two parties: the centre-left PASOK and the centre-right New Democracy. Since 1981, these two parties have consistently scored at least 77% between them in general elections. Yet they have a combined total of around 35% today - an extraordinary collapse.
A great deal of conflicts are waged and dissolved here through sex, which Bogdanovich is unafraid to intimately detail. His knack for visual suggestion through minor detail shots - Jacy's hand gripping the pool pocket, Ruth's single tear as she turns away from Sonny, Duane's deer-in-the-headlights look when he leans over Jacy for the first time - cuts right to the emotional core of these frequent sexual encounters. The cast is uniformly spot-on in their depictions of sex that runs the gamut from tepid and dispassionate to heated and emotionally charged. Shepherd in particular is stellar in her role, freezing Bogdanovich's camera every time she looks in its direction with her glistening, naive eyes and her glossed lips that curl as if to communicate her body's every urge. Despite the ambition of every guy in town to possess her both for her money and her looks, she has an emotional volatility and inability to connect that is disconcerting, so much so that when Duane departs to the army towards the middle of the film and Sonny finally gets his shot at her, the reaction is not one of encouragement but of apprehension. No matter how close he thinks he can get she will remain remote, and he's probably better off continuing his secret romance with Ruth than feigning a marriage with Jacy.

So when she learned it would be part of the estate sale, she said "Oh, I definitely want that!" And she even wrote out a check for it. But then she realized that she didn't NEED the desk, she just WANTED the desk. She needed a bunch of other things instead. And she didn't even really have room for the desk. So she felt totally foolish. And she quickly called the estate sales person and asked that the desk be put back into the sale. And then she prayed that someone else would buy the desk. And now she is awake at half past midnight, freaking out that her friend will think she is a total spaz because she kept saying how much she wanted the desk previously.
What makes an emergency? How does a child know when grown-ups are "finished" talking? Will it be like listening for microwave popcorn to be done, 1-2 seconds between responses?

Brush a layer of veg oil on the top side and flip it over then leave it to cook for another 2 minutes. Cook until golden on both sides then put it in the oven to keep warm while you cook the rest.

I threw a tantrum. I was on the floor crying, thumping my fists and legs as hard as I could. A lot of people were staring at me, but I didn’t care. I tried to keep on crying, but I couldn’t. Crying took so much energy in me that I couldn’t sustain it. I stopped crying. Ma and Annika were still laughing.
Each episode so far has shown an increase in the unhealthy influence Rea’s father has over her, most jarring (a compliment, in this context) in the entirety of episode two. The true depths of her father’s depravity, coupled with her mother’s negligence, paint a picture of a home life that would make even the most hardened abuse counselor sick with disgust toward her parents; when you don’t think that Rea’s life can get any worse, it does.

With most of the wedding planning check list crossed off, we're finally thinking a bit about our honeymoon.

One day Elisha went to Shunem. A prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to eat some food. So whenever he passed by, he stopped there to eat. Then she said to her husband, “I know that the one who often passes by here is a holy man of God, so let’s make a small room upstairs and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him. Whenever he comes, he can stay there.” (2 Kings 4:8-10, HCSB)
Daniel gets a pretty good pop, as opposed to Sheamus who gets booed loudly when his music starts. I hope to see AJ get involved and help DB regain the title, as we’ve seen her backstage already. Sheamus takes down DB to start and the crowd continues to get on Sheamus, and we get a loud Daniel Bryan chant. Sheamus hits the rolling slam and locks in a submission hold, but DB makes the ropes. He goes back to it and DB rolls him up for the near fall, though the ref counted three, and Sheamus quickly goes back to his power moves on DB. DB able to knock Sheamus off the top rope and begins to dismantle the champion with his scientific skills. DB has slowed the match down to his style with his submission skills, which makes this a very different style of match. DB gets caught with a big clothesline and Sheamus quickly hammers the challenger before hitting a very impressive fall away slam for a near fall. Sheamus able to hit the battering ram, diving shoulderblock, and gets another near fall but Sheamus is already looking exhausted. DB pulls the ropes down as Sheamus charges, sending him to the floor and DB charges for the dive but Sheamus catches him with a forearm. Sheamus goes for the Celtic Cross but Bryan rolls through for a neat fall. DB goes for the Yes Lock multiple times, but Sheamus powers out and charges, DB moves and Sheamus smashes into the steel post. DB gets Sheamus back in and unloads with a series of kicks on the champion, who’s in the ropes and the ref calls for the bell, as DB has been disqualified and the crowd is furious. DB quickly applies the Yes Lock on Sheamus, who holds on way too long for my liking, and finally passes out from the pain giving DB the second fall. DB should reapply the hold for the win, as the doctor comes in to check on Sheamus, while DB leads the crowd in a chant of yes. They’re giving Sheamus way too much time between falls, and they need to call an audible and give DB the win as the crowd is going insane for DB. Third fall starts finally and Sheamus hits the kick right away, and the crowd is pissed, rightly so. Sheamus crawls over for the cover and gets a near fall, which cause the crowd to erupt. Both men are struggling to get to their feet and DB up first and kicks Sheamus, who fights back but a kicks to the head knocks Sheamus down getting DB a near fall. DB climbs the ropes, this won’t go well, as Sheamus catches him up there and hammers the challenger. Sheamus goes for a superplex but DB headbutts him down and goes for the splash, but Sheamus moves and DB crashes to the mat. DB charges Sheamus in the corner but Sheamus moves and DB lands badly, this allows Sheamus to make the comeback with all his usual moves. Sheamus hits the pump kick again and wins the match, deflating the crowd. 7/10 a good solid battle, this is the match we should have had at Wrestlemania. DB should have won, but they’re hellbent on Sheamus versus Del Rio for some reason, instead of DB as champion.

An alternative title for her work could well be, "A History of the People of the United States. I can give this work no higher compliment.

The Apostles counted it as joy that they were hauled off to prison and beaten for the Lord. To tell you the truth, I’d rather be beaten than lose my loved ones, but we are given what we are given in the way of suffering for Jesus. Count it as joy and reflect God in your response to that. That IS what the bible teaches. I have to say that personally, since I’ve learned to forgive and have become a born again Christian with an actual overwhelming willingness to hear God, I can say that I am so thankful to now have a relationship with God that is loving, forgiving, and healing, that I have only praise for being brought out.

This was true of one man I met at a gas station. As he was pumping gas for me we chatted about the usual things. Everyone wonders what a light skinned girl is doing in Chile. I explained why I was there, then began to question him about his faith and family. He enthusiastically announced that he was a Catholic Christian. I smiled happily and by the look on his face I imagined that my apparent approval of his confession of faith had assured him of his sinless state and much heavenly bliss to come.

As far as the workout goes, I am surprisingly stiff, which tells me that even with the "muscle confusion" principle in P90X, you still do get accustomed to doing the same moves and that changing it up can be GOOD!

I could go on, but let me close with a major theme of our times. Since politicians now continuously run for office, it is difficult for them to agree with the positions espoused by the other side. This is a problem for both sides of the aisle, but I would not be President for all the tea in China. When everything you do is chastised, critiqued and lampooned by the opposing party, it makes it difficult to govern and for us to be governed. The President has actually done a better job than the GOP would let you believe. He has not been perfect, but he does not get his “propers” from the opposing force. So, when the GOP criticizes him for not doing enough, it amazes for the lack of context. The GOP Congress has fought him at every turn, even ideas that many in the party agree make sense. For example, unbiased economists would tell you the stimulus package worked, it just was not enough. So, when a new stimulus is needed, we cannot even talk about it. Housing based recessions take on average six years to come out of – a 2007 Harvard/ Maryland Professors study of all housing recessions over time. We have had modest growth for 25 straight months. Could the President have done more – yes? Could Congress have helped more – absolutely?

One good thing (besides GREAT health!) to come of my recipe experimentation? THIS recipe! Enjoy hot, tasty bruschetta? This recipe is the bees knees! The only thing I change is the rosemary.

As a general guideline, plan on serving 3-4 pieces per person, per hour for a reception. You have a variety of both hot and cold choices for canapés and hors D’oeuvres. If the reception is going to be their dinner, add on some items with substance or maybe a pasta or stir fry station. If you have expensive items like jumbo shrimp or mini lamb chops, have them passed to avoid “campers” who stand in front of the food and eat it all. Having some of the items passed will help keep your costs down because you won’t run out and have to order more, everyone theoretically will have the opportunity to have some and the passing service adds a touch of elegance to the event.

Both Audi and Toyota were BTCC front-runners in the 1990s, the German marque taking the title in 1996 with Frank Biela. The entries will increase the number of manufacturers represented on the grid to nine, making the BTCC one of the world's most varied championships.
So, I guess I’ll end with an open-ended question – is the reason for the desire for a flat ontology/immanence ultimately because of ethical concerns? My answer is yes, it should and must be. If so, then what are these ethics? My sense is these MUST value talking about racism before frogs (although frogs are important too!), not because of anthropocentrism, but as Steve Shaviro has recently argued, anthropomorphism. Humans are a complex example of what is to be valued, ethically and politically, in the universe, but not the privileged standard of value. Otherwise, anything humans did would be de facto good.

I found it to be a well-written story, and when it seemed ready to wrap-up, it took another turn and carried on. The characters were well-developed and three-dimensional, but there wasn’t much time spent on the enemies. The focus of the conflict was internal to the characters, and between them within the flight school.

So in terms of learning new ways to code and to do it more efficiently, I tend to translate what we write into the computer into logic and/or English. Ever since taking CSE20 and philosophy, I learned a lot about how logic works, and even more importantly, the true power of the BOOLEAN. I know some people think true/false is a strange way to think about things, but for me, it’s been working out great. Even when it comes to complex statements and bodies of code, by simply using true/false in my head, I’ve been able to keep everything as simple as possible.

Although the words "venomous" and "poisonous" are used interchangeably in everyday speech, they are actually fundamentally different. By definition, venom has to be injected into the body, introduced by a bite or a sting. Poison, on the other hand, is ingested or inhaled into the body by the victim. Thus, venomous and poisonous animals are altogether different.

My advice to fellow writers is bury your head in the sand and write what you want. Ignore the glossy covers, ignore Twitter, ignore the rights deals section of The Bookseller.

Of course, I dearly hope Hollow Pike strikes a chord with young people everywhere, but for now, I’ve written a book that I love now and would have loved then.

When I started I would have women with me for a whole year until their baby was 1 and now that rarely happens.

Transport infrastructure has been under-funded by the UK Government and the Welsh Government for a number of years. We welcome and support the Secretary of State for Wales in calling for the electrification of the Great Western Main Line to Swansea, and we call on the Government to announce plans to extend electrification of the line to Swansea at the earliest opportunity. There is a perception that the high cost of the Severn Crossings toll acts as a deterrent to inward investment in Wales. In our Report on the tolls, published in 2010, we noted that there was a lack of empirical data to confirm this view. The Welsh Government has commissioned an economic impact on the bridges' operation and future and we look forward to the publication of the report.

I’m glad I’m not working the graveyard shift at Price Chopper or Walmart. I’m not making a cashier’s hourly wage in retail, or having to fake being nice on a bad day just to get my tips that I’d end up having to split anyway. I’m not serving people food or drink of any kind. I’m not working weekends or nights. I’m not doing a job that anyone off the street could walk in and do better than me if they really wanted to.

Though I have a few complaints (mainly things I was disappointed not to see), I understand why most of the choices were made when the movie was being put together. I trust that, since the author was so involved with the screenwriting process, she has her reasons for signing off on things being included, excluded, or presented a certain way. The changes would have bothered me more if she wasn't one of the screenwriters. To be honest, they might also have bugged me more if I'd been a Hunger Games fan for years instead of a day by the time I saw the movie, though I was deeply impacted by all three books, and I consider myself a fan of them now.
I found myself on the fence this year. I had anticipated it to be quite pleasant -- visiting family and friends, exchanging gifts, and eating delicous delicacies, but the Enemy has rained on my sunny day once again. By now, I should expect this of him. And as simple-minded humans, we initial turn to the Heavens saying (or shouting) "Why?" I should also know better that he does not ause the less than pleasant things to happy, but he does allow them to happen. Again, we ask "Why?" The answer is always for His Glory.
It's currently fermenting at 20C, I'll check the gravity again on day 6 and 7 and see if it's finished. Until then, here's a shot of the sparge in action, and the wort going into the copper;
You would be surprised how many interesting conversations, and people, that you come across when you are out and about. For instance, on a recent trip to walmart as I was going to the register I passed a man in an electric wheelchair, who was completely capable of waking ask two passing girls if they were single, there were some tense laughs and then it was over. And I was in the middle of it, sort of like a spectator. Now something like that would be good if I needed a view on characters who are wild punks. Then there was the time were I was in a restaurant and witnessed a group of older people walking out and there was a little altercation and then they left. And there was a time when I was standing on a city street, and this elderly woman stopped walking and randomly started telling me about her day, and then walked off. Either I’m lucky enough to get good material to use in a story, or odd things just follow me everywhere.

Based on an article in today’s N&O by Andrew Curliss, Durham is rapidly moving toward seeing its second DA in less than a decade removed for ethical improprieties. Curliss’s piece traces Cline’s by-now-standard pattern of fabrications, but it also shows that the county’s “minister of justice” has been reduced to lying about seemingly trivial matters.
Although I nearly went for The Beatles’ version this was fresh in my head from a Stax set I did a couple of weeks ago. It’s an instrumental version by easily one of my favourite soul / funk groups of all time.

The Nutcracker is Christmas and the Waltz of the Snowflakes is my favorite piece from it. Growing up I wanted to perform the Snow Queen's the pas de deux.... That said this version doesn't have a snow queen, but hopefully you will find the sheer multitude of grand jetés as entrancing as I did.
The Loews is the way you'd imagine a movie palace to look: a box office and marquee on the outside, followed by a carpeted lobby with a chandelier suspended from the ceiling, columns all around, and a grand staircase leading to the restrooms and the balcony (which is currently closed, pending repairs). The auditorium has a center aisle and two side aisles leading to the main stage, where off to the side there's a fancy old-style organ, and yes, a professional organist plays it prior to showtime. My descriptions don't do it justice; you need to go to the website and see the pictures for yourself, as well as the restoration process that the theater has undergone. If I lived closer, I'd probably volunteer to help keep it clean.

“Brother,” my daughter immediately pipes in. The fact that she can now pronounce his full name helps in her ability to sell her brother out. With more knowledge comes more ability to lie. I think Darwin discovered that.
Point to note: One phone call I received enquiring about this from the network. The guy asks me to explain everything!! I asked if they every maintained any logs of calls!!! Frustration mounts if you have to explain each time about the issue & the history! I asked him sarcastically if Kanchipuram was Chennai. He goes I don’t know I am from Gurgaon. Told him don’t care if he were from Timbuctoo but I needed the correction done on my bill (which can be produced as proof of address for any official purpose). He does not even bother to cover up he tells his colleague in Hindi that I speak too much! I responded back in Hindi saying anyone would if they went through what I do to get my address right! He continues to his colleague “yeh madrasi hindi janti hai!”. Limits! And these people teach us phone etiquette!!!!
Another film that suffered from this was the French thriller "Tell No One", which ends with a laborious 15 minute explanation by one character that at first convinces you that it is laying down the facts, but then you discover that it contains even more needless wool-pulling. Half of David Mamet's most recent films never know when to stop toying with us. I would also add "Mystic River" and "Gone Baby Gone" (like "Shutter Island", they are based on novels by Dennis Lehane), which each contain several more narrative twists and coincidences and bits of trickery than is really necessary and often do not serve character or emotion. They almost feel designed to extend simple stories through plot mechanics in fear that the resolution may come about too quickly rather than justifying its plot through character development.

Sometimes, people go to see the Doctor when they are quite well, for instance, when they need more tablets for their BP, or to check out some bloods that were done when they felt bad, but now they're over it thought they should do the right thing and just "check it out". Those times are good to get to know each other and maybe just "chew the fat" for a few minutes - just like in "real life". So today, seeing as you're all feeling so great, I'd just like to share a photograph I took this morning. It's at a special place known as the Palace Gardens of Versailles, France: and it's beautiful.

A good thing you should do is for you to allow loved ones be aware that a person maintenance. Help with dinners, ply the children’s nursery, drop in having a gift or perhaps credit card, or maybe phone. Anyone does respond to be able to burning differently, however trying reminds men and women they are certainly not alone. You’re proper care could help draw attention away from these people off their sorrow making it possible for a simpler move in to a typical schedule. In other words, just becoming there is an best thing you can do to aid.

Like I said, perhaps I don't know what is happening here. After-all, Naudé is an award-winning Afrikaans poet, and he is suppose to be amongst the cream of the crop. It is of course possible that I simply don't get him, given my dismal history with Afrikaans in school. Whilst I loved my teachers (most of them), my brew of coloured Afrikaans was obviously not the 'taal' of the 'Regte Afrikaners' and so, Afrikaans poetry and poets have never captured my imagination. Bob Marley, Adam Small and GrandMaster Funk did. So, yes, I am disadvantaged and please feel sorry for my loss. Funny thing is through, I don't feel any sense of loss yet. Perhaps this is why I don't understand the lot of liberal Afrikaners, who do poetry, throw profanities at their NG Calvinism and by that feels themselves liberated from the shackles of the past. (I have to admit though, I was/am a big fan of Andre P Brink, but that's beside the point).

Yesterday I had the great pleasure of stroking an elephant. I was sorry for it mind you, standing in its place outside a temple in Pondicherry. It was calm and friendly enough, reaching out its trunk to passers by. I wondered how large its living accommodation was. The last temple elephants I touched were in Kerala and Weeza and I were able to ride them and feed them bananas. That was out in the countryside, they looked as if they had a good life.
The Forgotten Waltz by Anne Enright
Many of my music files come from records, especially 78 rpm records, that I own. Since mostly these records were made during the 1920s through the 1950s (with some being made both before and after that time frame), that makes them 50 to 90 years old. And some of the records were played many times over the years and not taken the best care of, so they can be really full of pops, scratches, and other noise. I also get files from free downloads on the internet. I do a lot of searching to find the oldest and rarest recordings for my collection. And since many of the files that I download in this way are in their "noisy" form, I also do my noise reduction on them.
Alison has now started refusing to hold Lynn's hand when we walk. He is very disappointed and feels like we are digressing. I don't think so. I think she is feeling comfortable enough to express her wishes. She acts like she doesn't understand the translator at all. No response when we use it. She won't speak any English even to say "Hello David" or "Goodbye David". Her shyness is quite apparent. We will just have to be patient. I am not discouraged. This is such a major change for her. We are ok.

For a number of years now, NATM has participated with NMMA in an annual Trailer Regulatory Round-Up in Washington, D.C. Representatives from FMCSA and NHTSA participate in open panel discussions to answer safety questions and discuss ongoing safety concerns and issues. In the same letter from Administrator Ferro, she writes, “This cooperation and collaboration between organizations is critical for the continued advancement of commercial vehicle safety. It certainly makes our job easier when a trade association such as NATM takes the lead in ensuring that safety is a primary concern of its members.”

That night, I started reading the book to her. She could read it herself, but I wanted to share my writing process with her, and because of the father’s depression and disappearance in the book, I wanted to explain anything she had questions about. We read two chapters, and she was disappointed that we had to stop for bedtime. A good sign. I didn’t want to ask, though, what she thought so far. I didn’t want her to think she had to please me. I wanted to know, gulp, what she really thought.

Those of you who pay close attention to details may have noticed that this is my second post of the day. It’s not my usual M.O., but, I have a long list of subjects I want to write about. Plus, I’ve had some additional free time today: schools in Prince Edward Island are closed for the day due to a weather system that has brought snow and strong winds to our little island. Such winter storms at this time of the year are not unheard of: spring tends to hit P.E.I. relatively late and normal temperatures are between 4 and -4 degrees Celsius.

A goal or a tackle happens in a fraction of a second. The ball hits the back of the net, the player lays on the pitch, grimacing with pain before being taken off the pitch. The memories of games are made up of such instants. I remember lots of them, Sharon remembers them less well. Snapshots of goals, yes, but mostly not of goals, but of funny or emotional moments. The black and white world of Banstead Athletic on a January afternoon when Wade Falana (who wasn't playing that day) hurdled 3 rows of seats to join in the goal celebrations with his teammates. Billy Harding forgetting to tape, or lace up, his socks so his shin pads jiggled free of them every few steps, nearly tripping him each time, a feat of hilarious keystone cops shin-juggling. I remember with great fondness the day when at the start of the game one of our ex-players ran out for an opposing team and starting playfully punching an ex-colleagues arm repeatedly to try and give the skinny winger a dead arm before kick off. Then there was the invention of our inept, seldom seen substitute Bernard Labadie. He set up a game between the subs one particular half time. They each took turns to play keepy-uppy, juggling the ball from foot to foot trying not to let it drop. But if they did let it touch the ground they had to stand still while each of the others pulled a hair from their head. The memory of them wincing as they volunteered their head for their team mates always makes me smile.
Everything good and natural is being covered-up and neglected,” Dr. Horowitz said on behalf of FLUscam.com viewers. “Only idiots would trust their governments to administer Baxter’s blood-borne intoxications called “flu vaccinations” to allegedly “immunize” against man-made bioweapons created for depopulation by the same cartel that rejoices in mass murder.”

I need to preface this by saying that this week is a hard week workwise for me, I'm deeply enmeshed in these semi-annual week-long meetings that not only do I have to plan, organize and manage but that I then must attend. I also plan and attend all pre-and post meeting activities, such as dinners, team builds, etc. It makes for very long days, lots of hard work and a really exhausting schedule.

I used to really hate turkey in most forms, but I guess turkey meat producers are doing a better job of putting out better tasting turkey products. Still, the way I enjoy turkey most is a whole roasted turkey, covered in nice crispy skin, where I can chow down on drumsticks and pope's noses and cover everything in tasty gravy. Otherwise, I can take it or leave it.

Beth Arnstein (BA): This is a tough one for me lately. My son is a year and a half and, though he’s never been a good sleeper, he has recently cut his naps to a half hour a day, tops. With dinner preparations (he likes to help me cook so I have to get the dangerous stuff done while he’s not around) and other responsibilities, it has been almost impossible for me to write during the day as I had before. And with him still not consistently sleeping through the night, the early morning shift popular with many writers (including Lisa Rose as she said in her interview) seems too tough for me too. I’m squeezing in some writing during Sesame Street and in the evening after he’s gone to bed. I’m not as productive this way, but I’m trying to make it work. I don’t think I’m too different from other writers who work or raise kids. If it is important enough, we just make time.

Let's go back to the top of the closet, so you can see that there are two full-length-of-the-closet shelves, perfect for storage of extra blankets, sheets (in bin), clothes that are too small and waiting for their next home (in bin), etc. There's plenty of empty space on the top shelf next to the blankets.... thrilling! That means there is room for growth, if needed. My guess is adding a third child, who will be a girl, will take care of that little problem. ;)
