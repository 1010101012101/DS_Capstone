Because Democrats passed on an opportunity to do right by the taxpayers, they're now being punished by the party in power. The new legislative maps pretty much guarantee that Democrats won't win back the Ohio House next year and that Democrats will probably win just four of the state's 16 seats in Congress.

Indeed, he blundered in the endgame that night, with a game-deciding turnover in the final minute— an errant pass off screen/roll. He had overwhelmed Rajon Rondo until then — outscoring the All-Star 24-zip — but as the team met in the middle of the postgame locker room, Irving summarized the game this way for his teammates:

Why this franchise feels indebted to keep playing this guy, I have no idea. There is nothing left to see from Felton, whose attitude and play has been the single biggest torpedo to this sinking season. The franchise owes him nothing, not after he committed the most unprofessional of acts -- coming to training camp overweight and out of shape, then blaming his poor play on the coach. All the while, he was a whispering cancer in the ears of Gerald Wallace, Marcus Camby and even to a degree Smith.

Now we're at a house on S.E. 63rd Avenue. What? You mean "Portlandia" extends past Cesar Chavez Boulevard? Amazing. It's the middle-aged helicopter parents from last week (the ones hovering over son Alex Gavlick). He's got graying hair, and wears a cardigan and pleated khakis; she's got graying hair and is trying to dress up comfortable wear with a little detail on her loose, blousy top. He's assembling a fire pit in the backyard, and both indulge in fantasies of Burning Man-style bacchanalia as they gaze serenely on the do-it-yourself home project. Once it's done and lit and a spark lands on him, she fire-extinguishes their little backyard flame, and that's that.

There was a notable attempt at drama last year with "The Chosen One," in which Schneider plays a car salesman and alcoholic, who becomes suicidal after his wife leaves him. He encounters some South American shamans who want him to perform a selfless act having to do with a bird's nest, so snow will fall on their ancestral homeland once again.

Hugo is the son of a clockmaker (Jude Law), a kindly, bespectacled man who teaches his son the beauty of cogs, wheels, and mechanical synchronicity. The father is at work on an automaton - a self-operating machine in human form - when he dies in a fire. Hugo goes off (with his father's notebook, and with the automaton) to live with his drunkard uncle (Ray Winstone,) a man responsible for keeping the clocks running in the Paris station. They live high, high above the stalls and cafes, the bustling main concourse and train gates, on catwalks and platforms with windows looking out across the city; the giant gears turn, the clock faces casting light into the room.

“Considering we lost 8-3, we’re the team that has to kind of look inward and try to figure out what went wrong and figure out what we’ve got to do differently,” Copelan said in a conference call Monday of the four coaches participating in the conference tournament. “Now with that said, we’re at this stage of the season and we’re 11-3 for a reason. So we can’t try to reinvent the wheel here. But we’re going to have a little bit of a different game plan going in, and we’re just going to try to play at a high level. I think everybody inside of our locker room understands that we didn’t play a great game this past Saturday. So we have an opportunity to try to right the ship.

You've got 24 million people out of work, and we have never had such a long period of people out of work. The number of months people are out of work is just tragic, and I know the impact of being out of work for a long period of time, having seen it with people that I know and love. I won't tell you about all my family members, my extended family members. But being out of work a long period of time typically leads to depression, often to divorce, loss of faith -- I mean it's more than not just having a paycheck.

Sometimes we get so caught up in our daily lives that we don't stop to take stock, but this year-end column on the year's best restaurants forces me to do just that.

The call to prayer broke their conversation. One of Mohamed's uncles got up and left for the mosque. The preacher's voice, which touched every cranny of the village, was scratchy over the loudspeaker. It went quiet for a moment, then other sounds stirred. A man led his sheep to market on the dirt road; around the bend, boys and men patched tractor tires and tinkered with engine parts that lay scattered like silver puzzles.

President Barack Obama has admitted to dabbling in drugs. Many applauded his honesty, as I do. However, had he been caught up in any of the draconian and arbitrary drug laws this country enforces, there's no way he'd be elected to any office whatsoever.

2. You won't immediately know how much your total airline ticket will cost when you book online — at least not yet. (You will see more realistic totals in advertising, however.) The DOT has put some rules into effect that benefit consumers, notably the tarmac rule that keeps you from having to wait eons without food, drink or restrooms (emergency landings and snowstorms notwithstanding). Now the DOT is working on getting you the total cost of your ticket as you are booking it. That means taxes and fees, the cost of the seat with extra legroom, the cost of your bag (see above) and so on are included. The implementation of this total-visibility rule probably won't occur before 2013, if indeed it occurs at all. From the perspective of the airlines and third-party online travel agencies — the Expedias and Travelocities of the world — the idea of accounting for every contingency in online ticket booking is staggering. Or, said another way, the new DOT rule could be the full employment act for programmers.

Set on what must be the most enviable property in Arizona, the resort Auberge de Sedona overlooks a wide, leafy creek with a view of Sedona's iconic red rock mountains behind. Sedona is one of the world's 11 "vortices," or areas with high electromagnetic fields, said to be good for healing and invigorating body and soul. It also has the most startlingly magnificent scenery, surrounded by iron sandstone cliffs, glowing red in the strong sunlight. The newly refurbished L'Auberge de Sedona has a spa giving transcendent treatments such as energy healing, reiki and reflexology. To cleanse and invigorate, visit the Sedona Rouge spa for a hammam spa ritual treatment or a clinical (i.e. real deal) ayurvedic consultation and massage with a therapist who trained under Deepak Chopra. If you were ever going to try something different, this is the place. Just as healing are the silent hikes among those rock cathedrals. When you first hit town, head to the Hike House and take advantage of the free software that maps hundreds of hikes according to terrain and difficulty (and try the Energy Café for trail mix). Then return to the oasis of L'Auberge and order beetroot carpaccio and duck confit in their creekside restaurant.

At lunch that day in a café on the Pointe du Grouin, overlooking a sputter of rocky islets beloved by French sailors and birds, I committed a sacrilege. I had a mound of steamed mussels, raised in their own beds on Mont-St.-Michel Bay because they crowd oysters out if not carefully isolated from them.

Our national debt is in excess of $14 trillion, and neither Democrats nor Republicans have the courage to make unpopular choices, so let’s cut out the drama and go bust right now. Maybe some of our creditors, such as China and Saudi Arabia, will bail us out, but don’t count on it.
