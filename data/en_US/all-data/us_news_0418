Holliday has spent almost the entirety of his 2½ seasons with the Cardinals serving as enforcer behind three-time National League MVP Albert Pujols, who rarely budged from the No. 3 spot following his 2001 rookie season. Former manager Tony La Russa was wedded to the idea of assuring his best hitter, Pujols, a first-inning plate appearance. Since Pujols elected to take free agency to the Los Angeles Angels, the Cardinals' new manager believes the same distinction should fall to his four-time Silver Slugger in left field.

Or take textbooks. College textbooks are, in effect, rental goods. Students buy them at retail, use them for four months, and then resell them to the campus store or a used-book dealer. In 2010, the U.S. college-textbook market was worth about $4.5 billion, according to the American Association of Publishers. But why buy textbooks when you can spend less and rent them? Chegg.com, founded in 2001, has raised more than $200 million in funding and is aiming to displace the college bookstore. An undergrad can buy an economics textbook new for, say, $263. At Chegg.com, she can rent a hard copy of the same book for $94 for 180 days, or an electronic copy for $128 for the same period. As more students come to campus with Kindles, Nooks and other e-readers, the more efficient consumption of college textbooks is likely to grow rapidly.

In its early iteration, rap indeed was a form of first-person reportage, a "story of the streets" passed from lips to ears on stoops, in backyards, on mix-tapes, over radio waves. Putting needle to the groove opened a door to a very particular time and place: Imagery, slang and situation. Rap was an extension of the American oral tradition. Its very durability forces deeper consideration.
Like Jobs, former Google (GOOG) Chief Executive Eric Schmidt also drew just a buck in salary, but Schmidt also pocketed $313,218 in bonuses and other compensation.

The rest is history as grunge rock, and then grunge fashion, took the world by storm. Or something like that. If Pearl Jam Twenty has its share of hyperbole, it's leavened with humor, self-deprecating commentary, and a deep-pockets budget's worth of great clips (Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Stones; Elvis Presley at the Seattle World's Fair; David Lynch, and so on). Pearl Jam Twenty also chronicles the band's battle against Ticketmaster, which led to congressional hearings; its not-always-welcomed political views, and the tragic Roskilde Festival, in which nine Danish fans were crushed to death during Pearl Jam's show. That event forced the group to reexamine how it operated, and why. The reflection, and remorse, manifested by Vedder and company are striking.

Attacking institutional racism and making systemic change toward a more just and equitable society require leadership, a plan of action and sustained grass-roots participation. Tweets might come in handy, but there is no substitute for intense civic participation -- voting being just the most basic.

The car companies are encouraged by how quickly Americans have downsized from larger engines to four-cylinder power plants. Almost half, or 47%, of the cars sold last year had four cylinders, according to auto information company Edmunds.com. That's up from 34% in 2007.

Not once did Magic disparage McCourt publicly. If anything, he took pains to treat him with respect. He chose a financial backer -- Walter -- who preferred to stay in the background behind him and Stan Kasten. He chose to add the well-connected former president of Sony Pictures, Peter Guber, to his group late, signaling that he may have learned a thing or two about the value of celebrity in this town from Lakers owner Jerry Buss. And he chose Kasten, a man who has been the president of franchises in the NBA, the NHL and MLB. The one negative, and it's a big one, is that his group agreed to partner with McCourt on a joint venture for the land around the stadium. According to one source with knowledge of the situation, that decision might have been the key one. That part will remain troubling until it is explained further. So will the amount of money McCourt stands to walk away with, even after he pays his creditors and his ex-wife."

It was very common for many a doctor in the late 19th century and the early 20th century to use themselves as guinea pigs.

Privatizing public parks and forests is not new. Private firms have managed many federal, county and local lands for years, such as Ocala National Forest in Florida. Vendors charge entrance and other user fees and pay government a percentage as they handle all maintenance and park operations.

If Democrats kill the package, it would mark a stunning defeat for Obama and a huge political bet that voters will blame Republicans as much as Democrats for an impasse that would lead to higher taxes starting Jan. 1.

Like a verité The Blind Side, Undefeated is about an affluent white person who mentors and time-manages low-income black football kids. And like the hit Sandra Bullock film, Lindsay and Martin's documentary doesn't delve as deeply as it should into its characters' lives. Despite plenty of face time and rounds of self-questioning and rumination, Courtney, for one, remains enigmatic - we never fully understand why he's obsessed with running the Manassas team. There's more going on here than mere beneficence, or some serious jock jones.

It was his older sister's blues records that first caught the young Estrin's ears. "She had a couple of Jimmy Reed records that really got me. She saw I was interested in that stuff and she gave me, for my 12th birthday, this record, 'The Genius Sings The Blues' by Ray Charles. And I just started getting into it, man. There was just something about that music that spoke to me a lot differently than the stuff that was out on the radio then, especially the white music. It just felt like Ray Charles understood how I felt, which was probably pretty delusional for a kid. But I found a lot of comfort in those records."

A. "I learned what I never wanted to do or emulate. In fact, it made me overcompensate in the other direction. Here at MSM, we want to make sure people have exhausted all their possibilities in finding a place for themselves within the organization. There definitely is an effort to try to make employees flourish. Rather than say "You can't do it, goodbye," I ask if there is another dimension you could add to our company.

 Floors: The Swiffer-type mop works great on tile or linoleum, but it requires expensive refill pads that don't necessarily outperform generic refills costing up to 60 percent less. For the extra frugal, the mop sheets can be flipped over and used again. Or wash them in a mesh laundry bag for multiple uses. A super-cheap alternative: A simple string mop or sponge mop paired with homemade floor cleaner (1/4 cup white vinegar mixed with one quart of warm water).

As I experienced that night, and again on the train returning to Paris the next weekend, you don't need a DJ to take advantage of the social perks. Pop, house and hip-hop blare from loudspeakers in the party cars until shortly after 2 a.m., when the bartender closes up for a few hours. Though I didn't see people dancing, the bar and lounge were veritable social scenes with people flirting, groups merging and conversations starting.

The Tax Foundation keeps the main tax scoreboard, listing states by income taxes, sales taxes and so forth. The most-often consulted rankings are those relying on tax rates -- the percentage tax people pay on a given dollar of retail sales, income, gross receipts or whatever. I rely on the Tax Foundation stats often in my column, noting for example how many other states have sale taxes equal to or greater than Maryland's 6 percent, or which states have top personal-income brackets higher than Maryland's. (There aren't many, when you include the local, "piggyback" income tax.)

Want to have a chance in Bork's court? You had better be rich and powerful, according to an analysis of his record as judge on the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by the Public Citizen Litigation Group. In split decisions, Bork always sided with businesses in legal battles with the government. And he nearly always sided with the government — most notably the Reagan administration — when challengers were workers, consumers and environmentalists. Public Citizen found that Bork's rulings offered no "consistent application of judicial restraint." Rather, it was the identity of the parties litigating that predicted Bork's vote.

--Mental and physical performance. It's clear that the caffeine in coffee helps people stay alert, focused, and feel a good boost. A study published in Current Sports Medicine Reports found that coffee improves performance and endurance during prolonged exercise, as well as boosts short-term, high-intensity athletic performance; enhances concentration, reduces fatigue, and heightens alertness. And mental benefits may extend beyond performance. Several studies have found that coffee may protect against Parkinson's disease. A 10-year study performed by Harvard researchers and published in a September 2011 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine revealed that increased caffeinated coffee consumption was linked with 20 percent lower risk of depression in more than 50,000 women.

In my 30s, a decade after I'd traded Cleveland's snow belt for New York City's neon promises, I began to consider images of my childhood neighborhood beside images of Hiroshima. How amazing, that an almond-eyed woman from one side of the war married a blue-eyed man from the other, a union her Japanese parents would never bless. And, most astonishingly, how these disparate atoms spliced and melded together to make me and my sister, to make us, a little nuclear family. Somehow the same nuclear science that destroyed my homeland and scarred my Japanese family came to feed and sustain my Japanese-American family. Try explaining that to my great-grandmother.

Mr. Kan was last in the spotlight in August, when he tendered his resignation as prime minister barely a year after taking office, and just over five months after the March 11 tsunami triggered the Fukushima meltdowns.

Anthony Herrera (Minnesota): The Trinidad native went from an undrafted free agent to a regular starter over the past five seasons with the Vikings, but his play has waned as he inches closer to his 32nd birthday. He was graded as the league’s ninth worst right guard by Pro Football Focus after the 2011 season, and the Vikings then made him a salary cap casuality. He met with Chicago Bears officials during the first couple of days of free agency, but he remains unsigned. Even with declining options, the Ravens should be able to do better at left guard than Herrera. But I couldn’t resist including him when his addition could give the Ravens three former Vikings on their starting offensive line.
One of the great benefits of staying at the farmhouse is that visitors can wander the grounds, 250 acres of lakes and coppiced woods and fields and orchards, before garden visitors arrive at 11 a.m. and after they leave at 5 p.m. I could see more intimately the work and care that went into the heavy, clay-like soil. Wealden barns were full of small tools for hoeing, raking and planting.

"More Than Words" begins with an introduction to books created in the 1910s and 1920s by artists associated with avant-garde movements in Russia and Europe, such as Aleksei Kruchenykh, Olga Rozanova, Il'ia Zdanevich, El Lissitzky, Sonia Delaunay, F.T.

Adam Reifer, a hard-throwing righty, drew the seventh inning. Against Aderlin Rodriguez, Reifer got a busted bat and a slow-rolling grounder. Kozma charged. He had difficulty getting the ball on a clean hop. He tried to look toward second for the force out before he had a grip on the ball. When he then regained control and started toward first, the ball slipped on him again and his throw bounced into shallow right field. Kozma received only one error on the play -- for the throw.

The arrangements on Gil Scott-Heron's early recordings were consistent with the conventions of jazz poetry -- the movement that sought to bring the spontaneity of live performance to the reading of verse. Jack Kerouac and other Beat poets, for instance, often read while accompanied by percussionists. But it was Langston Hughes, the star of the Harlem Renaissance of the '20, who exerted the most profound influence over Heron, and it is not an exaggeration to see Heron as Hughes' direct successor. Like Hughes, Scott-Heron was fiercely proud to be black, and forged his cadences from centuries of African-American traditions; like Hughes, he took as his great subject the everyday struggles of the poor and dispossessed. Langston Hughes never feared controversy; nor did Gil Scott-Heron.

In fact, we clamor for the federal government to provide more health services to veterans.

The 50th anniversary of the Crested Butte Mountain Resort should, quite fittingly, be a powdery one. Forecasters say La Niña will once again have it in for this quaint mountain outpost in southwest Colorado. But in this place devoted to extreme sports and adrenaline junkies without the pretense of some resort towns, record snowfalls are a source of celebration. There's a reason Crested Butte is a playground for Olympians and X Games athletes alike: an average 300 inches of snow each year.
