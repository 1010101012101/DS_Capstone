46) The American Royal, an every-autumn-since-1899 horse and livestock show, was first known as the National Hereford Show. It picked up a new name, the story goes, after an Iowa State ag school dean returned from the British Royal Agricultural Fair and declared that the KC show compared favorably with the Brits'. The American Royal, meanwhile, is also at least part of the reason our major league baseball team is known as the Kansas City Royals.

THOMAS: Potentially, given that he had knowledge of his tenant's undocumented status and still chose to rent to him. However, harboring is not defined under the state statute. Even under federal law, harboring is not defined by Congress and federal courts have struggled to find a universal definition. Here we are dealing with a state statute that has yet to be interpreted by Arizona state courts. It is not clear whether the intent of the Arizona Legislature was to attach liability to landlords who knowingly rent to undocumented individuals. The other issue is that the landlord must have been doing so while in violation of another law. The landlord seems too far removed from the underage drinking violation here, but that statute is so broad that the landlord may have a problem for violating any other "criminal offense" such as failing to file taxes.

Early adopters play this game too: They make purchases like investors, betting that a future update will eliminate a product's initial flaws or add capabilities they want. Consider how many digerati bought iPhones, confident that software wizardry would let them modify the phone to work with wireless services besides AT&T or that Apple would bless third-party applications for the device, letting them bend the device to their own specifications. If you'd bought a gadget with such expectations in 1988, people would have thought you were insane.

There's not a lot of incentive for people not to carry guns in this city. Myself and Kirk Lewis (Mayor Dave Bing's chief of staff) are going to meet with Wayne County Circuit Judge (Timothy) Kenny and 36th District Court Judge (Kenneth) King to see if we can have a conversation about what kind of time is being given out, and what kind of bail is being put out, for people just carrying guns illegally.

Garfield plays Biff as a twitchy, James Dean-type brooding rebel — his hair does half of the acting. Meanwhile, the lumbering Hoffman keeps things closer to the vest. He’s at his finest when he’s most subtle, as when Willy’s humiliated by his much younger boss, Howard Wagner (Remy Auberjonois), who belittles and then fires him.

Sieve said she coaches students to consider looking for a Safe Place location if they find themselves in certain scenarios - some of them not uncommon. Sometimes teens find themselves at parties where they feel unsafe and have no way to get home. Sometimes the driver for their ride home becomes drunk.

Those self-service soda dispensers with refillable 64-ounce mini-kegs at convenience stores should be banned. The evidence of the health hazards of soda drinks is legend, and include tooth decay, bone loss, and obesity. Yet, soda is peddled in ever more user-friendly, heaping helpings at convenience stores.

The Giants have a bunch of options on the offensive line, as they prefer to have. David Diehl and Will Beatty can both play left tackle, Diehl and Locklear could be guards and those two can also play right tackle, as can last year's fourth-round pick James Brewer. So in short, there could be plenty of shuffling between now and the start of the regular season.

WASHINGTON -- No one familiar with the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 should relish the prospect of a trade war with China -- but that seems to be where we're headed and is probably where we should be headed. Although the Smoot-Hawley tariff did not cause the Great Depression, it contributed to its severity by provoking widespread retaliation. Confronting China's export subsidies risks a similar tit-for-tat cycle at a time when the global economic recovery is weak. This is a risk, unfortunately, we need to take.

Linda's also diverges from big sister by adding spinach to its artichoke dip. We ordered it one night as an appetizer and it was excellent, something to enjoy as we sipped our pretty fair sangria. The dip comes to the table in a standard pie crust, which serves as a bowl. You can either use the chips to enjoy the dip or, as I eventually did, have at it with a knife and fork and eat it like a pie.
The odds are against any team's ever winning four Super Bowls in five years, which would bring a record three in a row to the Patriots. Obviously, it doesn't follow that because theirs is the best team, they'll win it all again. Indeed, the percentages favor a new champion. Yet the Patriots, as of last year, were the only pro club playing the game right — with appropriate defenses and aggressive pass offense. In fact, the real NFL mystery is why so many of the other coaches let Belichick get by with it. The reason he wins is spelled out in detail every week in films and tapes. More than any other business, football can have no secrets. The NFL problem is that most other coaches are still playing old-fashioned ground-play football and/or overvaluing defense. The door is open again for passer Brady and signal-caller Belichick — provided only that they keep attacking as usual.

The egg pizza ($7.95), a perfect mix of ingredients, needed to be attended to quickly since it was served with everything else. That way when the egg broke, the yolk seeped ever so slightly into the light tomato sauce, creating a creamy coating for the spinach, mushrooms and pancetta. It's definitely fork-and-knife pizza; the crust sags a bit in the middle if it sits too long.
About half of them had to cross Eads Street, which runs through the middle of campus.

More than 1,000 partygoers got a behind-the-scenes look at the region’s largest kitchen pantry at Cleveland Foodbank’s 17th annual Market event on April 22. The party, featuring nearly 100 restaurants and drink purveyors, was held for the first time at the Foodbank’s cavernous headquarters in Cleveland’s Collinwood neighborhood. Co-chairs Loree Vick and Anita Gray did an amazing job leading a team of volunteers in transforming the space into an epicurean wonderland. Plain Dealer food and restaurants editor Joe Crea and Spice of Life Catering founder Ben Bebenroth lent their names and talents as honorary co-chairs. Spokeswoman Kristin Warzocha said she expected the event to raise more than $165,000. In 2011, the Foodbank distributed nearly 34.5 million pounds of food to 600 local hunger programs, enough for 29 million meals. — Kathleen Murphy Colan, Special to The Plain Dealer

I've advocated for a bold move from the front office. And as I'm shouting into the halls at One Center Court, what I hear in response is a mostly empty echo. Feels a lot like the big moves and major decisions are Seattle-driven and out of the hands of general manager Rich Cho. And so it's again incumbent upon owner Paul Allen to make a shift and redirect the franchise, as he did in giving up on his Jail Blazers Era.

As with many things in sports, it's difficult to separate cause from effect.

The story is based on an 1891 play by Frank Wedekind that was subtitled "A Children's Tragedy" and often banned for its dark content. Sater's book softens a few of the edges and offers a more hopeful ending, but the plot still focuses on a trio of ill-fated friends.

They also say it's important that parents get involved because in some cases their daughters are victims of sexual predators who rely on the confidentiality of abortions to hide their actions.
"They can do meaningful journalism," Steele said. "Their process is not as substantive as it should be regarding sourcing. They often use unattributed sources in their reporting, and that is problematic. It diminishes the accuracy of a story. You run the risk that unattributed sources won't hold the truth."
Dr. Richard Lewis, a cardiologist, was performing a pacemaker procedure on an anesthetized female patient at a Mesa hospital when a male scrub nurse assisting the surgery saw Lewis fondle her breasts.

It should reach 175° to 180° on a candy thermometer - your finger should leave a clean trail across the back of the spoon.

Sitting in a Ferrari or a BMW leaves me feeling envious of people who actually drive one. But Bill Gates cant do anything more with a Rembrandt masterpiece he owns than I can do with the ones on display at the DIA (unless he decides to sell it and use the proceeds toward, say, a Ferrari). For the most part, though, priceless art is a lot more democratic than pricey cars.

In other words, charter schools provide a place for ambitious parents and children to form a more rigorous academic environment with like-minded families. There's no reason L.A. Unified can't create public schools in almost every neighborhood that do the same. In fact, Santa Ana started its first fundamental schools three decades ago, before charter schools and year-end standards tests. The original focus, since softened, was on strict, back-to-basics education — hence the name "fundamental."
He later added, "I look forward to moving to the next phase and looking to the citizens and residents of the community, not those who live outside the community, to be full and able partners with us as we move to the next stage."
Great atmosphere. Refreshing event. Lots of energy inside the building. We probably need to be here more often.
Thus, the new educational lexicon involves “rubrics,” “measurable learning outcomes,” “quantifiable standards of performance” and “numerical targets.” Suddenly, these calculations have become the basis for funding and accrediting and hiring and firing, which turns the whole intellectual process inside out. Curricula are designed to satisfy the numbers, students are conditioned to tick off their rubrics mechanically when they fulfill assignments, and schools are mandated to engage in ongoing “assessment.”

Genuinely opening the Gulf and other offshore petroleum reserves, and freeing up onshore natural gas deployment, would create 2.5 million jobs in exploration and development, as well as in construction, steel, cement and other industries.

Farmers markets, like battleships, take a long time to change direction. Such has been the case with the Studio City venue, which since its founding in 1998 has always been a "family-friendly" event, with a pony ride, petting zoo and lots of prepared foods and crafts. While striving to maintain this social element, Carole Gallegos, who took over as manager six years ago, has gradually cut back on the crafts and upgraded the lineup of produce vendors by adding small, quality and organic farms. As a result, the market is now one of the two or three best in the San Fernando Valley.

Chris was well qualified for the soundtrack since he wrote and recorded guitar instrumentals for years. His 1993 album "Guitars and Oranges"was a collection of his instrumentals; a number of pieces on the film's soundtrack come from a 2000 collection of instrumentals he recorded to mark the opening of a golf course in Eemnes, Holland, called "Goyer Golf Suite." He specialized in clean, precise tones that illuminate the crystalline, sometimes ethereal compositions on the soundtrack.

More recent thinking tends to absolve the hull plates, noting that the ones seen on the ocean floor seem plenty bent — not shattered. Some metallurgists now suspect some of the 3 million rivets that went into the ship’s construction. Examples recovered from the ocean floor show very uneven quality and many popped heads. If the “poor rivet” theory is accurate, then the iceberg’s impact caused these metal bolts to snap, zippering open the hull’s seams.

In the final hours of session the Governor's septic bill passed which will require counties to establish separate tiers for planning uses. In tier four, for Harford County areas zoned for one development right per ten acres, this decrease will mean a reduction of development rights in Northern Harford County of 30 to 40 percent. This means that Harford County residents in the northern tier of the County will have a forced downzoning by the State of Maryland. This will mean reduced property values along with reduced capital borrowing ability for our farmers. It also places in jeopardy Harford County's award winning land preservation program.

That doesn’t have an obvious connection to the subject I was writing about -– and was therefore easy to cut from the story -– but it’s a look at the same, complicated problem, though from a wider angle: Does it matter if we get entirely digital? And more importantly, what do we lose if or when we do? And now the real uncomfortable question:
"Him getting ejected could've really hurt us," Bryant said. "In that sense he's really going to have to control himself and pay attention in those moments where he doesn't erupt too much."
What happened: Lenders packaged the subprime mortgages they generated for resale to investors on Wall Street, thus transferring risk down the line. These bondlike investments seemed appealing because they offered enticing yields for what buyers thought were low risks during a period of skimpy interest rates. Yet investors far removed from the mortgage-origination process didn't understand the risks they were assuming. Some hedge funds bought these securities with heavy use of leverage and got slammed when the market froze. The Bear Stearns collapse stemmed largely from the firm's hedge-fund exposure.
"It's different now," Davis said. "My other friends can do stuff like go out to dinner and movies. I go home from school, play with my son, put him down for a nap, clean house, cook dinner and start my homework.

We circulated a draft of this agreement in June and asked the county's mayors for comments. In response to those comments, we revised the agreement to respect a business' request for confidentiality, clarify that general promotion of your city does not constitute "poaching," minimize administrative burdens and confirm that revenue sharing is not required. Nothing in the agreement hinders a business that wants to relocate or prevents a community from making its best pitch to attract such a business.
"We filled some needs and created a lot of competition,'' he said.
PITTSBURGH, Pa. -- In some ways it resembled a Browns-Steelers game of yesteryear. Defense reigned in a slugfest that knocked both starting quarterbacks out. Both returned. Colt McCoy had the last turnover and Ben Roethlisberger the last laugh.

Once your way to the breast is clear, you can begin to work on the white meat. There are two approaches to this. The first and most familiar -- carving the breast into thin lengthwise slices -- is, alas, not the best way. Cut with the grain like this, the slices tend to fall apart, especially if the breast is the least bit dried out. Furthermore, the first slice will get the lion's share of the skin, leaving the others skimpily covered.

8 ) I'll skip over the American occupation of Haiti between 1915 and 1934, except to say that it was done for the economic and military interests of the U.S., not to stablize the Haitian government, which was admittedly chaotic at the time. There were certainly benefits for Haiti, particularly in terms of infrastructure, but they have to be weighed against the violence, forced labor, and racism that came with the occupation.
The 2008 Cuvee A Pinot Noir is light red with scents of cedar, spice, red fruit and a hint of chocolate. Peppery fruit is nicely smooth and round at first and balanced by lively tannins. The pepper carries through to the finish. It's a delightful expression of this beloved Burgundian grape.
Vogel said he is especially concerned about declining morale among teachers, who he said deserve a pay increase. The board last week told teachers there is no money for raises.

After five or six minutes, Campbell recovered, and the band roared through "Refugee," "Runnin' Down a Dream" and "American Girl" before calling it a night. Appropriately, the dance party going on in the heavens ended about the same time and the lightning subsided as Verizon's house lights went up.
A report in October by the Congressional Research Service, an agency that conducts research for lawmakers, said about a quarter of those earning $1 million or more per year—94,500 taxpayers—had a lower tax rate than 10.4 million moderate-income people.
Good: Eric Moreland, Collier's replacement, tied a school record with six blocked shots. The redshirt freshman with a 7-foot-4 wing span has become a defensive force. With Jared Cunningham on the perimeter and Moreland inside and atop the 1-3-1 and with Angus Brandt drawing charges left and right, this can be a decent defensive team.

It's all very Preston Sturges hyper-literate screwball meets Busby Berkeley -- and in today's grungy world, it's a lovely bit of fantasy. It's also very funny, especially in the interplay among the ladies and various men in their lives. The lineup includes a modern-day follower of the Cathar sect (Hugo Becker as Xavier), a student pretending to be a financier ("The O.C.'s" Adam Brody as Fred Packenstacker/Charlie Walker) and array of "moronic" frat boys led by a dude named Thor, upon whom the girls take pity.

Oh, and maybe a brand-new James Bond picture (although they’ve yet to shoot a frame, or even pick a title). And a little film called “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” — the beginning of our two-year, teary-eyed goodbye to the best friend that Hogwarts — and Warner Bros. — ever had.

That, more than the blogs or the cellphones, is the true modernization of the character, one that takes into account the general de-stiffening of the national upper lip and the shifting needs of contemporary drama. Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson and even Detective Inspector Lestrade (Rupert Graves), originally crafted almost purely for exposition, are all granted a depth and freedom that adds, in turn, to the complexity of the central character. But it's Watson who benefits the most, with Freeman capturing the careful balance of fascination, irritation, admiration and love with a subtle mastery that, in the 11th hour, saves the season's final episode from all its necessary contrivances.

The first time you run across one of these things, which is a mutantly large xiao long bao, you may try to lift it with a soup spoon, the way you would an ordinary soup dumpling, and it will tear itself apart with its own floppy weight.

If Fairley and Leshoure excel in the fall, this story will be long forgotten.

The NBA owners owe Sacramento and its loyal fans a clear statement of where they stand on the arena and on the Maloofs. It would be helpful if they heeded City Councilman Kevin McCarty, an arena skeptic, who suggests that he would be much more comfortable with the deal if the NBA would stand behind it, maybe even guarantee the 30-year lease the Kings are supposed to sign on the new arena.
Yet this is not that rarest of tomes, a negative estimate of Lincoln. For while Flood portrays a human, sometimes even cranky, president, these negatives are overshadowed by his convincing portrayal of an exceptionally humane leader superbly managing the most difficult period in the history of the United States. It was difficult in 1864, with many military disappointments, most notably the incursion of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early's audacious marauders as far as the outskirts of Washington.

Whole fish is a specialty at Downtown, and the branzino ($24.50) was lovely; however, the greens and cold barley salad with dried cranberries, pistachios and a balsamic vinaigrette made it seem more like a summer luncheon dish than something that would have been served during our recent cold snap. The brick oven-roasted chicken ($18.50) was denigrated by a red wine sauce that pooled in the bottom of the plate like soup, practically covering the baby carrots and turning the potato puree into mush.
"People think these are all hobby farms," she said. "What we do affects so many other people and not just here. This area's one of the only places in the world that grows clover seed. And the grass seed we grow goes all over the world.

Arizonans are tired of asking for help. They are tired of sending representatives to Congress who do nothing to address immigration. Arizona voters continue to say, "We must do something." That something is Senate Bill 1070. However, what they fail to recognize is that SB 1070 is a direct assault on the person rather than the institution that forces the person to be illegal.
Portland's losses in Game 2 and Game 3 are two of its three worst defeats of the season. And it's puzzling when you consider that the beat-downs came after the Blazers came up big in Game 1.

A premature exit from Afghanistan would be tantamount to defeat. Defeat will likely bring a return to the chaos that engendered 9/11 as the Taliban and Al Qaeda fill the power vacuum.

Other companies attach the sleigh bells to traditional leather straps for decorative door hangings at Christmas.

The answer is in the rim.
The 21-year-old Hawaiian leapfrogged High-A because he is one of the most refined prospects in the system. And, as a second baseman he has an unusual spot on the depth chart. The Cards have been a carousel at secon since 2002, and he is the only prospect in the system without an established player ahead of him (at any higher level in the minors) at his position. But advancement is not earned on stats alone.

Superb as Cornish is, the character is such a stock figure, and her tale so sluggish and obvious, that she shouldn’t be in the film at all. Wallis Simpson (a flinty Andrea Riseborough), whose tale is intercut with Wally’s, was quite enough woman to make a movie about: A nobody from nowhere, she had neither great looks nor class but possessed an ironclad determination and an unerring fashion sense. Why ever would Madonna take an interest in her?
* CM Punk and Mark Henry met in their third WWE Championship match in as many weeks, though this time the match had no countouts and no disqualifications. They worked a good match, but didn't take full advantage of the stipulation, as the only real weapon they used was a chair. It was nice to see Chris Jericho's involvement kept to a post-match promo, as his interference in the match would have been predictable. Punk and Henry managed to put together a good mini-program to keep Punk and Jericho separated. Jericho's footage of Punk walking in and out of a pub was pretty ridiculous. I spent a month in England, visited about 37 pubs and never had a drop of alcohol, so I can relate to the champ in this situation.
"It's a lost opportunity," says Portland City Commissioner and Cultural Trust board member Nick Fish. "It's September, and too many people just don't know where the candidates stand on these issues.

and trendy vibe, Tani displayed a surprising blend of quality sushi and reasonable prices. Pieces of sea bass and tuna were phenomenal, and the cucumber roll, usually a bland space-filler, showed a delightful crunch and fresh flavor. I'm still undecided on warm sushi, but Tani's bestselling Oh My God roll has a spicy kick and expertly balances its fish and sauce flavors.
Yekaterinburg, Russia: Inexplicably, the tour does not stop in the western Siberian city where the last czar was executed, Francis Gary Power's shot-down U-2 spy plane is on display and Boris Yeltsin was once local party boss. An unfortunate oversight.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., asked administration officials on a Sunday night conference call how they would prevent sending GM manufacturing jobs overseas to China. Last month, several lawmakers were furious the administration didn't speak out publicly when GM considered importing a fuel-efficient car made in China. GM has since announced it will build the car in the U.S. in one of the plants that had been targeted for closing.
Agents sometimes encourage annuity holders to cancel existing policies and transfer funds into new ones with offers of better interest rates, new features and promises of bonuses that will offset surrender charges.

Until now, the years-old effort to renovate the school's football stadium, which sits on an earthquake fault line, never raised many alarms.

If AIG failed, officials said, the banks would follow.

A huge tepee village will provide living space for more than 1,000 Native Americans representing 34 Northwest tribes. They will perform ceremonial dancing during the Round-Up and exhibit quill and beadwork, dolls and exquisite handmade jewelry at a crafts fair.

If you just feel gritty after a long trip and don't need a lie-down bed, some big airlines operate premium facilities airside at their most important hubs that include shower facilities, clothes pressing, and other welcome services.

Unfortunately, those facilities aren't available to the folks in economy class who really need them the most.
