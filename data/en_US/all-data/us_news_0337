Perhaps that's why, to a degree, Eva and Kevin understand each other so dreadfully well. Their mutual dislike is the substance of their relationship. Eva is patient, says kind things and behaves in a solicitous way, but nobody is fooled. And what about Franklin, her husband? He maintains a steady, affable friendliness that is almost creepy. After he and Eva have a daughter, he lavishes love on both equally. Kevin goes through the motions of liking his father, and he's deceived. Not Eva.

We can put Americans to work retrofitting outdated, dirty plants with updated pollution control technology. There are about 1,100 coal-fired units at about 500 power plants in this country. About half of these units are more than 40 years old, and about three-quarters of them are more than 30 years old. Of these 1,100 units, 44 percent do not use pollution controls such as scrubbers or catalysts to limit emissions, and they pour unlimited amounts of mercury, lead, arsenic and acid gases into our air. Despite requirements in the bipartisan 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, these facilities have largely refused to control their emissions -- creating an uneven playing field for companies who play by the rules and gaming the system at the expense of our health.

Eight years of combat by the Oregon National Guard created wide political support.

For the city's politicians, there's no doubt that doing things Snyder's way means abdicating a lot. Under the proposed agreement, a financial control board would assume responsibility for managing the city's budget, contracts and anything else involving money.

You bet. Using a plant sterol spread every day could knock down your lousy LDL cholesterol by 14 percent. Plus, people who regularly use these heart-helping spreads also have lower rates of lung, breast, stomach and prostate cancers. Just don't put one big blob on your morning whole-wheat toast. Plant sterols do their job best in small doses, so spread 'em throughout the day (1 tablespoon of Smart Balance -- a spread with more sterols than most -- two or three times a day is about right). Sterols are substances found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and beans that limit your body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Pair them with a cholesterol-fighting statin drug, and you'll kick down LDL by another 10 percent.

Then I noticed a woman leaning on the boardwalk railing. She, too, had tears streaming down her face as she watched the men in the water. I looked around at the others nearby, but it seemed as if the four of us - my family and this stranger - were alone in witnessing this poignant scene. Unknowingly, the men had given us a backstage pass to a private moment in their lives.

† Date bottles when you buy them so you know how long you've had them. The spice companies claim that spices last about a year, but that's mostly to get you to buy new annually. Most will be good for about four years. You've likely got spices older than that. Open and take a whiff. If they don't smell like whatever they are, toss and buy new. Red spices (cayenne, paprika and chili powder) begin to fade as they age and lose potency.

Compounding the problem is the fact that many of the materials inside our homes these days emit low levels of harmful chemicals in the process known as off-gassing, where building materials release potentially harmful compounds through evaporation, often for years after the products are initially installed. Materials include many paints, stains, varnishes, vinyl, carpet, insulation, flooring, kitchen cabinets and countertops, plywood, particleboard, paint strippers, piping and upholstered furniture, just to name a few. Throw in cleaning products, crafting supplies and gas appliances like stoves, furnaces, water heaters and clothes dryers (while exhaust is routed out of the house, they can leak), and you've got a toxic stew (lead, formaldehyde, fire retardants, radon, volatile chemicals and fragrances) that you, your family and pets might be breathing in upwards of 15 hours per day.

Jemele Hill, ESPN.com: "All major sports leagues have expanded in the past two decades to boost revenue. And the NBA (16 teams since 1984), NHL (16 since 1980) and NFL (12 since 1990) include a greater number (and proportion) of their franchises in the postseason. From that standpoint, it's understandable why Major League Baseball would want to expand from eight to 10 playoff teams -- a decision that will be made or postponed this week. It makes perfect financial sense, but is it common sense? The answer is no. Do you remember where you were on Sept. 28, 2011? It was only the greatest regular-season finale in baseball history. The Boston Red Sox needed one more out against the Baltimore Orioles to make the playoffs. Trailing the New York Yankees 7-0 in the eighth inning, the Tampa Bay Rays needed a win and a Boston loss to secure a spot in the postseason. Then the most unreal, unpredictable, unbelievable thing happened. The Orioles and Rays both won in dramatic fashion. And the Red Sox claimed the notoriety of the most epic late-season collapse of all time. If the expanded postseason formula had been in place last year, those two dramatic games would have only affected home field for a one-game playoff between the Rays and Red Sox. Of course, Terry Francona might still be the Red Sox's manager and, most importantly, beer and chicken wouldn't be frowned upon in Boston's clubhouse."
Before Felberbaum’s students can generate stories from a pack of playing cards, they must "break away from the churning in their mind," he said.

There is a telling moment within the intimate family drama of "The Descendants" that has George Clooney running as if his life depended on it.

You're not sure whether he is running from something or to something, or both.

The project was built on land owned by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, a supporter of several cultural entities in the neighborhood, including Yerba Buena Center for the Arts and the planned Mexican and Jewish Museums at Jessie Square. The agency put up about $8 million for the design and construction of MoAD and will provide $500,000 a year, for 12 years, toward operating expenses (the museum's annual budget will be between $2 million and $3 million). The St. Regis developers, Carpenter & Co. and F.E.

Not feeling the "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" during Joshpel's version of this song. Too screechy. The judges must be getting bonuses for the amount of Standing Os they give to Joshua. Do the judges have instructions to "guide" America to vote for an African American soul singer? A tender performance of "Ready For Love" puts me back in Joshpel's corner. No shrieking or screeching, just hanging out with the song. Another Standing O. This one more deserved.

The other thing that drew him to the project was that it involved CGI and special-effects shots. "Normally, when you're talking about an independent film, it's just not feasible to execute that kind of component on a high level.

So what does this mean for Baca? County lawyers had asked the high court to step in, arguing that the sheriff shouldn't be held personally liable because he had no personal involvement. Under state law, Baca is likely indemnified, meaning the county picks up the check for legal claims. But that doesn't mean that the sheriff can't be questioned by Starr’s attorneys.
Hard to believe, but it is true. Richard Clam decided to commit suicide in this way in June of 2004.

The federal government has taken over 17 failing banks and thrifts this year, seizing them at a rate three times faster than last year. At that pace, it will "nationalize" 85 banks by year's end, compared with three -- yes, three three -- in 2007. Yet many analysts and investors wonder whether the government should be taking over more financial institutions, particularly a number of "too big to fail" firms that may not have the money to cover their expanding losses. The push for nationalizing big, troubled firms is coming from liberals and conservatives alike, as is the resistance. President Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and other top administration officials have spoken out against nationalization, yet their comments haven't provided much reassurance to investors fearful of being wiped out by a federal takeover. That uncertainty is hampering the financial industry's recovery, potentially dragging the government -- and taxpayers -- more deeply into the mess.

Stoudemire went to the bench with his fifth foul with 6:41 left in the third, and Miami went on an 11-2 spurt not long after that all but sealed the outcome. It was 67-58 when Fields made two free throws with 4:49 left in the quarter  and then the Heat's Big Three needed just three minutes to blow the game open.
So only time will tell whether Fisher and Snead turned their Friday night gamble - swapping out high first-rounders so that they could pick up volume in the second round - into a championship-foundation draft.
Over the past century, we've depleted the high-quality, easily accessible oil reserves. What remains are petroleum deposits that require ever more energy to extract and deliver. For the bitumen fields of Alberta, this means expending about one-third the amount of energy yield just to get the oil into the pipeline. That makes Alberta oil the dirtiest, most polluting choice currently available.

For example, an app knows if you linger on the Frontgate catalog page with the glass-inlay chaise table or open the SkyMall catalog five times in a month. If you're nervous about this, you can use the apps without signing in, though extras like saving favorites or bookmarking pages won't work.
But that implies bitterness at missed opportunities, and there is remarkably little of that in evidence here. Not that it's all happiness and joy, especially when the band steps off stage. Strange setbacks, even by rock-music standards, would befall the band, including the original guitarist joining a religious cult and an attempt at an intervention that leads to kidnapping charges.
"Spiritually, we were trapped in the odd historical vacuum between 'Rocky II' and 'Rocky III.' Rocky was still the world heavyweight champion — he hadn't lost his crown, wept at Mickey's deathbed, been pitied by Mister T. He had not regained the eye of the tiger. We had no way of knowing Apollo Creed was going to help him rise up to the challenge of his rival …. The jury was still out on this Balboa meathead."

President Barack Obama is now fully justified in asking the ultrarich to pay the same tax rates as their secretaries pay. That does not make him, as Rosenberg states, someone who is "actively promoting a socialist agenda. "Shame on President Barack Obama," Rosenberg tells us.

Sometimes people take a perverse pride in the city's reputation.

One "catch of the day" entree was barramundi ($22), a firm, hearty white fish that is generally associated with Australia. The grilled version at EdgeWild had a slight, appropriate browning at the edges and was served with a midsweet mango salsa.

The new label clearly states that Cristalino is not in "anyway connected" to Roederer Cristal, a prestigious Champagne that sells for hundreds of dollars.

Linguistically cryptic military diagnoses, the PR churn of the war machine and a merciless city that fed on its own long before its citizens started feeding on one another still endure in Whitehead's apocalypse, all the way to the bitter end.

Another Houston hit, "How Will I Know" wasn't nearly as soulful or as challenging as "I Will Also Love You." But it showed another, far more playful side of Jessica. By that point in the competition, we all knew she had more chops than that performance showed us. But she gave the song exactly what it needed. And wearing the ponytail off to one side was a nice touch. This showed range while offering the season's first suggestion that Sanchez is more than just the year's best female balladeer.

The fourth is at the edge of the city limits, at the Chain of Rocks Bridge.
A museum piece, this man. Of course Smith didn't feel that way, but he understands this is how many of his detractors - uncharacteristically silent this weekend - believe he should feel.

As younger historians entered the discipline, they discredited his thesis that immigration was a traumatic uprooting. "Handlin, many specialists now believe, overstated the alienation experienced by immigrants," University of Minnesota immigration historian Donna Gabaccia said in an interview Tuesday.

But the fact that both sides in the dispute may have motivations beyond the question of improving higher education and research in Maryland doesn't mean there aren't important issues at hand. There is tremendous potential for cross-disciplinary work between the professional schools in Baltimore and the academic departments in College Park. The pure science research on the main campus could benefit tremendously from closer cooperation and coordination with the medical, nursing and public health schools in Baltimore. The university's public policy faculty could surely benefit from better coordination with the law school. A top-10 ranking for total research dollars may not much impress faculty the university is trying to recruit, but joint appointments between professional and academic disciplines might.

On paper, at least, "In the Red and Brown Water," which tells the story of a girl named Oya, her competing suitors and her immovable sadness, is the most lively and sweeping of the three. "The Brothers Size," the first of the set to be written and produced, untangles the close, tense relationship between one of the characters from "Red and Brown," his ex-con younger brother and a former prison mate. Finally, "Marcus" pulls the focus out wide again, but, as Mack says, "in that one we're exploring (that character's) mind."
Cleveland Planning Commission Chairman Tony Coyne won $30 on a $5 slot machine but said he came more to evaluate the casino's appearance and how it fits into the heart of downtown.

Loe played just six minutes in the first half after picking up his second foul, a situation that also limited his time against Austin Peay. His only basket in the first half was a 3-pointer on SLU's first possession, and when he came in the second half, he immediately hit another 3. He just missed a double-double, missing out when a Rockhurst player was called for a charge on the game's final possession, negating the rebound.
"Now, 85 percent of the people who come in our door" are addicted to opiates, Hughes said. "Heroin is starting to show up more and more because we are starting to see that transition take place from an expensive drug like OxyContin to a cheaper drug in terms of heroin."
The first is that the contractionary effects of fiscal retrenchment are often partly offset by an increase in exports—but less so in countries where the exchange rate is fixed. Second, the pain is greater if central banks can't offset the fiscal austerity through a stimulus in monetary policy. With interest rates close to zero in the euro zone, such a stimulus is hard to achieve. Third, when many countries are cutting budgets at the same time, the effect on economic activity in each is magnified.

The writer bemoans the lack of compromise. The last time the Senate voted on a budget submitted by President Barack Obama (in 2011), the vote was 97-0 against the proposal. No compromise needed there. But when compromise was needed, on the health reform act, for example, there was none. Reconciliation was infamously used to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the Senate in 2010, so that Republican votes were not needed. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Stimulus”) was also passed without compromise or input from Republicans. The president stated to Republican leadership: “Elections have consequences — I won.” So much for compromise.

This would all mean nothing if the music failed to keep up, but it never faltered. “Wassup,” a moody slow-burner on record, became an aggressive rallying cry.

It’s a gimmick that could run its course quickly, but in Rocky’s hands, it’s remarkably tasteful and fun.

But ultimately, Zimmerman's online profile is as irrelevant as Trayvon's to any real understanding of the social dynamics that were at play the night the boy was shot to death. Worse, our fixation on this ephemera, the need on the one hand to make Trayvon some dark gangsta straight from Central Casting and on the other to find a Klan hood in the back of Zimmerman's closet, suggests a shallow, even naive, understanding of the role race seems to have played in this tragedy.

The third reason I would suggest for the violence is that those perpetrating it have mistakenly done what many fringe groups and sects in Jewish history have done, harped on one Jewish idea or element to the (partial) exclusion of the colorful range of important ideas and commandments in Judaism.

We may not yet be able to contend with the vegan food carts in Portland, the celebrity-saturated vegan restaurants in Los Angeles and the dichotomous landscape of high vegan gourmet and low vegan junk food in New York, but the Bay Area is still a pretty great place to be a vegan. "Everyone here knows what 'vegan' means," says Beck of Vegansaurus.com. And if you've traveled through many parts of this country, you'll find that, though we may take it for granted in the Bay Area, "veganism" is not part of the entire nation's collective consciousness. The Urban Housewife's Melisser Elliott knows this better than anyone, documenting the vegan food she finds during her travels in her website's Travel Guide section. At least in San Francisco "even omnivorous restaurants understand the need for plant-based dishes on the menu," she says.

My friend also introduced me to the bean burger, also called the tostado burger, another San Antonio specialty. She sent me to Chris Madrid's, 1900 Blanco Road, for a griddled quarter-pound beef patty augmented with a scoop of refried beans, a scattering of fresh onions, a handful of tortilla chips and a slice of cheese, all contained (barely) between two halves of a bun. Every meal needs vegetables, so I added a scoop of chile-studded pico de gallo. The fries are hand-cut, but I passed in favor of that other Texas classic, a bottle of Shiner Bock beer.

As one student's grandmother put it, Chappell, 51, "is old-school." But Chappell also is quick to give out a hug, and she is quite the singer, using musical rhymes and songs to help teach everything from counting to reading. Her class also had massive turnover. Nearly half of her students who were present during opening week moved out over the course of the year. In all, she had 30 students come through the door. She finished with 19.

Tierrasanta resident Barbara Chronowski first heard the ship's siren call in 1992 while on a cruise from New York to Southampton, the return trip Titanic never made. One evening mid-journey, Chronowski and her fellow passengers were suddenly bathed in darkness, followed by an eerie, engine-free silence.
