Think about that one: A sizable share of Republicans might actually support a prospective nominee whom they recognize to be fundamentally deficient. Perhaps this is easily explained.

Nothing builds aerobic capacity like climbing. Stairs, rocks, mountains: it's all good. But the mechanized versions work just as well.

Yet while it’s great to return to this ongoing saga, and occasionally director David Yates adds a fresh angle (like the animated fable of the Deathly Hallows) too much of this is not just by-the-book, but by-the-numbers.

Then, in the early 1990s, objective evaluations of DARE began to roll in, and each reached the same conclusion: Police officers, teachers, parents and students all may like the programs, and they may have the effect of getting some kids to overcome their fear of cops, but DARE didn't work at all in reducing youth drug use.

DARE also could create complacence among parents, who needed to take the lead in talking to their children about the dangers of drugs.

The rebuke of Ryan is a credit to the Catholic leaders, because they are displaying their doctrinal consistency even as politicians embrace church teachings selectively. Republicans hailed the Catholic bishops when they were opposing the Obama administration's policy to expand contraceptive coverage; likewise, they cite the church's opposition to abortion. But these same lawmakers have little interest in the church's position against the death penalty or its opposition to the Arizona immigration law.

A total of 20 people died from swine flu in Switzerland — out of almost 5,000 across Europe.

Despite the unapologetic nature of the GT-R, it's hard to argue with the sheer value the car presents. Plenty of ink has been spent debating the merits of this car versus the aforementioned Corvette and Porsche. $100,000 can buy you a version of one of the three that will undoubtedly put a smile on your face. The difference lies in the widely varied way each car draws out said smile. Where the GT-R trumps the others is how it is the only one of the three that has nearly all of the capabilities and physicality of a high-end supercar. For better or worse.

Norris' jazz riff on themes within pioneering 1959 drama "A Raisin in the Sun" requires no prior familiarity with Lorraine Hansberry's classic (although Center Theater Group has made that easier to obtain by simultaneously presenting the splendid Ebony Rep revival on Culver City's sister Kirk Douglas stage).

William Saroyan, the daring young writer from Fresno, lived and wrote in the Inner Sunset, drank in the city's bars, roamed its streets -- "every block a short story, every hill a novel," he said.

In the slow-go low-range mode, all the usual strengths offered by the TRD setup - big tires, skid plating, traction control, locking differential, low range - are still strongly in play, with the extra bonus of a touch more wheel travel at each corner. TRD engineers, we're told, worked long and hard to squeeze out every millimeter of full-droop and full-compression wheel travel as possible by tuning the front and rear springs and paying close attention to the progressive bump-stops. The added articulation and strong grip of our BFGs made short work of several steep off-camber hill climbs (by our calculations, about a 30-degree slope - almost a 70-percent grade) that made our seat belt tensioners cut into our shoulder as we climbed the rutted grade to the crest.

"We should’ve won the football game and it just didn’t happen for us. We’re professionals and we don’t want to say we came close or we can build on this. Obviously we can build on this momentum, but we let another one slip out of our fingers. I’m proud of the way the guys fought considering we had guys who came to the stadium today and didn’t even know they were going to play and stepped right in and filled in and didn’t miss a beat. But it still hurts though."

An ironworkers union leader on hostile terms with New Jersey’s public sector unions, Sweeney initially found much more common ground with Christie — too much, complained some Democrats.

Nagbe said he could have continued to play, but he would've risked a far more serious injury. The team's medical staff decided on surgery now to repair the injury and minimize how much of the regular season he'll miss.
Backes and many of his teammates have experienced winning a playoff game for the first time, and now they have experienced winning a series. Sometimes in sports, it's possible to make a cake and eat it too. Earlier this week, Backes was named one of three finalists for the Selke Trophy as the league's top defensive forward, along with Boston's Patrice Bergeron and Detroit's Pavel Datsyuk.
Overall, these things go in cycles for hoops. While we are fairly steady and/or growing in other sports areas, our basketball is up and down. We have had years in which there have been two guys going to Boston College (wow!) and others in which there have been none above the D-II level. A lot of it is reflective of our population and location. The Rocky Mountains have rarely been a hoops mecca or factory. But it would be nice if it was, wouldn't it?

Since methamphetamine gained widespread use in the 1990s, researchers have puzzled over what it was about the drug that made users so vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases.

At a recent town hall meeting, McClary said the housing situation is slowly starting to improve. Because of Proposal A and Headlee, the community won't see taxable value rise nearly as quickly as it steeply dropped.
øCombat plays the most significant role, however, with many powerful weapons to wield - from guns, grenades and crossbows to boomerang-like Wingsticks and RC Bomb Cars that can detonate nearby enemies. You can also use stationary Sentry Turrets and crawling Sentry Bots that automatically fire at nearby baddies. If you die, you might be able to resurrect yourself on the spot by performing some quick maneuvers on your controller, otherwise you'll need to load from the last checkpoint or saved game slot. On that note, be sure to save often as this game is tough - especially as the computer-controlled enemies react very intelligently.

And more occupational therapists are offering skills assessments and coaching to help older drivers compensate for impairments.

“We did a good job of using the ball well and on that play, I started on my right and got it into Robbie,” Donovan said. “Myself, Edson and him took off and Edson did a good job dragging a few defenders away and Robbie got it to me and I just wanted to hit the target hard from there and it went in.”

The Obama campaign has been amassing money and information and building a national organization for two years without the distraction of a primary race. At the end of March, Obama's team reported contributions totaling nearly $197 million. The Romney campaign reported contributions of more than $87 million. Mr. Romney, of course, has been forced to spend heavily to fend off rival after rival, and President Obama currently has 10 times the amount of cash on hand. Still, according to Bloomberg News, that advantage slips to a less impressive two-to-one when money raised by the Romney super PAC and other independent Republican groups is taken into account. Ultimately, the total expenditures to elect Mr. Romney could match what is spent to keep Mr. Obama in the White House.

Dogs figure in this year's presidential campaign. Already I've seen bumper stickers for "Dogs Against Romney."

Seamus responded with diarrhea, and Mitt had to hose down the car when they stopped for gas.

Opponents of this project claim that expanding the oil supply to Midwest and Gulf Coast refineries and distribution centers will somehow increase gasoline prices in the Midwest. On its face, this argument strains credibility. Even the U.S. Department of Energy has weighed in to debunk this myth.

The impact of dying churches is especially hard when local landmarks become targets for demolition. Yet congregations must be more than museums. A church must be something other than a repository of relics or an archive of memories.

“Safe,” though, is back to stripped-down action, smoothly made (the opening sequences, which cut on parallel actions to set up parallel stories, are particularly well done).
Piller reported that Caltrans employee Duane Wiles, who tested parts of the bridge's foundation several years ago  key tests to ensure it was safe  had been caught fabricating test results on other projects. While he was disciplined, he had not been fired.

The whole point of becoming self sufficient in energy — as well as importing crude from friendly Canada — is to become indifferent to crude purchased from countries that want to destroy us. Oil prices are set by global demand. If we produced additional crude so that global productive capacity is in excess of demand, world crude prices would fall, and as Mr Corredoira correctly observes, OPEC would be forced to cut production to maintain prices. However, OPEC members are not all equals in terms of production and population. Countries such as Nigeria cannot cut production because they have an immediate need for cash.

A week earlier he had introduced his Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would require a full accounting of each social welfare program. It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients.

Henri Dutilleux's Second Symphony, the other major piece on the program, also used the concerto grosso format, but in large scale, with a 12-piece chamber ensemble fronting a very full orchestra. With harpsichord, celeste and timpani among the soloists, the sonorities were captivating in their variety, and the kaleidoscopic transformations of instrumental color both among the soloists and between solo group and orchestra were captivating, thanks in no small part to the meticulous attention of conductor Gregory Vajda. For a piece the symphony has never played in the 50 years since its composition, it sounded extremely well rehearsed, with clean attacks, even momentum through tricky rhythms, and vividly realized textures.

Title insurance probably is one of the least understood parts of the real estate purchase process. We buy most insurance to safeguard us against future problems. Car or home insurance safeguards us against future losses. Health insurance safeguards us against the cost of future medical needs. Title insurance, on the other hand, safeguards the ownership of your home or other real estate against past mistakes or fraud. You are insured against things that may have occurred before you bought the property.

His other top receiver, Mo Massaquoi, was a non-factor because of foot injuries and a concussion. 5. His offense was learning on the fly. 6.
