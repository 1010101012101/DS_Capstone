The recipe comes from this book by Michael Barry, and is a classic French dessert. I gave the book to Nick for Christmas in 1996 and it contains easy versions of recipes for many familiar French dishes, some of which are otherwise immensely complicated and require much forward planning, beginning the preparation days before the food is served.

Stop in any pub, any restaurant, and there is always brown bread and vegetable soup. As I have written about before, it is always a pureed vegetable soup, but the color will change, depending on what veggie played the major role. Maybe white, maybe green, maybe orange, like the one I am going to make. And nothing is better on a cool, damp day (of which Ireland has a few) than a bowl of this easy, versatile, filling and pretty healthy soup.
By the 4th round it’s really hit or miss on picks and players after this point. Wide receiver Givens was taken in the 4th round. He’s a speed burner that needs to develop. The only problem is that is what most of the other Rams receivers have been and they all have failed or moved on to other teams and succeeded there. The Rams followed with offensive lineman Rokevious Watkins (can never go wrong drafting lineman, could always use more), kicker Greg Zeurlein (cut Brown and saved more than 3 million in cash? I’ll take it), outside linebacker Aaron Brown (best talent pick and happen to be in a spot we need, character issues again. If Rams suck on the field at least they’ll party and win bar fights), and running back Daryl Richardson (he probably won’t even make the team and for a 7th round pick, no sense stressing about this pick).

When I first started my blog this summer, I'll admit I was unsure how long or consistent it was going to be. What really keeps me going is reading other people's blogs on my Google reader and talking to friends who blog. One day this summer I helped some of my friends with their blogs, which was awesome. Now that I'm far away from all my college friends, I love being able to keep up with their lives in this sense.

It sounds a bit tedious but it was actually kind of fun. The tedious part was figuring out the electrical. Todd gets the hero award for this project. He spent seven hours on a Saturday, mostly in the crawl space, wiring these sconces to work with the main lighting in the room. Overall, the project cost around $150.

Having studied interior design, I’m passionate about interior (and exterior) beauty, whether in materials, colors, use of space. I live in suburban New York, but I often buy and read design magazines from France, England and my native Canada to see how differently their homes are created. I find them inspiring and often much more adventurous than the looks offered by American publications. The light is different, the use of historical allusion easier and colors often much richer and more muddled.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow me. If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?Is anything worth more than your soul?”

Miriam's gift is both fascinating and scary. She can read people after skin-to-skin contact and foresee the date and manner of their death. Wendig brilliantly utilises this idea to jump start the action and to misdirect the reader. I was afraid that it might hobble the immediacy of the narrative in places, as once you know that a character will only die in forty years time from old age, you won't have any anxiety for their safety if they get into bad situations in the story. As Miriam keeps reiterating that one of the rules of her visions is that they can't be changed, you have to believe the visions or the whole foundation of the narrative crumbles. However, Wendig manages to avoid this hobbling effect, by showing us even Miriam has doubts when the situations become desperate enough and while she believes the visions are correct, she can't help but think that this might be the one time she succeeds in changing them. This way there is still a sense of immediacy to the action and there are some edge-of-your-seat moments in the book.

The fourth and fifth time rolled into each other. Maybe because I was fed up of getting the same phone call over and over, I was not her parent, I was not her carer and I needed to be apart from her so I could breathe.

I really like P. G. Wodehouse. In fact, the other day I looked at this collection of Wodehouse’s work and thought, “I haven’t read any Wodehouse lately” and actually felt guilty. That is not a normal reaction. Something may be wrong. In any case, he makes me laugh, and is fantastic, so you know, tolle lege.

As it turned out, Pip loved it. The first time I popped the CD in the stereo he sat still and listened to the entire thing. Then, immediately after it finished, he asked to listen to it again. The next day I showed him pictures of the instruments as we listened and he quickly became able to identify both the instrument being played and the character that instrument represented (a flute for the bird, violins for Peter, french horns for the wolf, a clarinet for the cat, an oboe for the duck, a bassoon for grandfather, etc). Soon Polly began to pick up on these associations as well. Over the next several months Ava and I checked out the CD a few more times and with each iteration Polly and Pip added something new to the way they interacted with the music. First, they pretended to play the various instruments, turning appropriately shaped toys into a flute, a clarinet, a bassoon, a french horn, and a violin. Next, they took to rearranging the furniture in our living room to create the setting of the story. They put Peter’s meadow with its pond and tree in the middle of the room, built a stone wall out of the couch, designated the dining room as the forest, and placed the garden gate by the front door. When all this was set, they then proceeded to act out the characters’ various movements – Peter dancing through the meadow, the duck swimming in the pond, the wolf circling the tree where the bird and the cat had taken refuge, Peter lassoing the wolf’s tail from the tree.
Rock Climbing: I think Peter could get into this sport! He's doing a good job climbing up on just about anything vertical: shelving units, baby gates, boxes, mommy and daddy, chairs, and even walls. Nothing stands in this boy's way. He climbs over Ethan and Ethan gets a kick out of it. I love Ethan's laugh!!

There's a twenty-five minute stretch in this musical where there's no music, in which the "obnoxious and disliked" John Adams vigorously argues in favour of American independence. More than any other film, it really captures the drama of political debate and oratory. The film also provides an in-depth look at the necessity of compromising a principle in favour of getting something accomplished: a Declaration of Independence without any mention of slavery might be a flawed document, but it's one that's going to be signed. It puts an incredible emphasis on how personalities-- a wish to stay anonymous, a desire to be well-liked, arrogance, and a sense of honour and duty-- impact political decisions more than static talking points. (Or they did, at any rate.) It communicates a sense of real fragility and danger that's been lost by the time we get to Trumbull, and it deeply humanizes its founders with more than a little salty humour. And, yes, it does all this with some really great songs.
Would you say that is correct?
"Rejecting joy to stand in solidarity with the suffering doesn't rescue the suffering. The brave who focus on all things good,all things beautiful,all things true even in the small,who give thanks for it and discover joy even in the here and now,they are the change agents who bring fullest Light to all the world. When we lay the soil of our hard lives open to the rain of grace and let joy penetrate our cracked and dry places,let joy soak into our broken skin and deep crevices, life grows."
That turned out to be a mixed blessing. It kept me persevering through more rejections, but I also took it as a sign that the epic was good. Even when the full was rejected I kept writing sequels – sequels which, of course, couldn’t be submitted anywhere.

I really just wanted to pick him up and throw him to his room but I restrained myself and just sent him to his room while I checked on his brother. Don't worry he wasn't hurt... severely anyway but he was crying and so I picked him up and held him and stuff. All the while trying to calm myself down so I could deal with his brother in a way that would be constructive and not destructive.

The year after Lola's birth was a hormonal bath of crazy. I was still too close to my childhood, still working for freedom, still therapizing, following instruction, diligently making entries into journals and practicing emotion health: still failing often. The addition of post-partum hormones did me in. I wept, I worried, I could not sleep, only making myself eat correctly for a nursing baby, I felt furious, depressed, terrified; I banged a glass window with my fist in anger, and it gave into long vicious cracks and one piece that flew in a white shard and cut my arm. I called my husband. He left work. He came home and held me. He could have said You aren't who I thought. He could have said I hate you. He could have said Marrying you was a big mistake. He could have said I can't live with you. He could have said You are fucked up. And he would have been right. What he did was hold me while I cried, stroked my hair, and told me in the gentlest, kindest voice anyone has ever used toward me that I had to do something different, because this wasn't OK. He kissed my face and my mouth and he told me he loved me, whispered the concrete steps that I would take to get better. And next week when I left him with the children to go drive around the block weeping, he was there, cradling Lola with a concerned face, asking me was I all right. He was putting up with my shit.
And to his home he must get. To see his children and try to forget.

It’s a little weird to think about, if I’m honest. For the last month or so, school board elections have been a constant presence in my reporting. It felt like most weeks at beat, we would discuss some new piece of our coverage that needed to get done. There was always a new way to tackle the coverage, further coverage of the candidates to get another election issue to explain. And now it’s done. The bond issue and tax levy passed. The candidates get sworn in Monday. It’s weird to think about reporting without some kind of conversation about election season coverage to do.

Lovie is a likable, sometimes catty and possibly unreliable narrator as she recounts Dinah’s short career as a newspaper columnist, Avis’ marriage to a wealthy drunk, and her own long-running affair with an older, married man. As in The New Girls (my favorite of Gutcheon’s many novels), the characters’ lives typify the times. “Dinah said it was as if we’d all gone to sleep one night in the world of Edith Wharton and awakened the next morning at Woodstock.”
It's very likely that the NHS will cost the Tories the next election (although bearing in mind that the next time we'll go to the polls will be in 2015, that might be a little bit of wishful thinking on my part) and that Andrew Lansley won't be in charge of the health system by then. He has conducted himself in a most unsympathetic and callous manner. My biggest fear is that by then it will be too late to reverse some of the changes that Cameron wants to introduce now.

Enjoy the in-between, but don’t get stuck there. Sometimes I become afraid of the destination, afraid of change, and get comfortable with the in-between. I’ve seen this happen to women in labor, I’ve seen this happen to college students, and I’ve seen it happen when I’m not ready to move on.
If you’re planning to use your new laptop at your desk, then any of the Apple lines will be great. But if you’re a business traveler who has to work on the go (especially in a crowded airplane seat) or a student who has to fit a laptop into a backpack or messenger bag, you’ll want to make portability a priority. Also remember: the more powerful the processor, the more power it consumes-so if you’re going to be unplugged while working, that may be a consideration.

The journey has begun.
When I returned to South Africa in 1968, that annus mirabilis of student power, I somewhat sadly left my copy of the “Little Red Book”, and a book on guerrilla warfare by Che Guevara, with a college friend, Alan Cox. It would have been crazy to bring them back to South Africa, as I fully expected my luggage to be searched on my return, though it wasn’t, and it would also not have been a good idea to have the SB find them in a raid, though they never raided me. The SB visited to take away my passport, and later to give me a banning order, but did not search the house, so I could have brought them back and kept them with impunity. Alan Cox was murdered in Pakistan a few years ago, so I’ll never discover what happened to my books.
The passage below is taken from a WW I propaganda magazine, as you can probably tell from its upbeat tone. But it does tell us something about beer, so I can forgive its other sins.

Here we go again and this time I am going to write about it! I have three children and right now in 2012 they are ages 11,9, and 7. Two years ago my oldest son was diagnosed with a intestinal disease called Chrones. It was a surprise with his young age that the disease would show up so early. It all started with a stomach flu, that never went away.

‘It is in a woman that man’s body is formed, and it is of a woman that he is born, it is to a woman that he pledges his word, it is a woman who is his companion, with a woman he shares his roof, and it is through her that his life is lived out. When a wife dies, one looks for another. Society can only exist through her since it is through her that kings are born. All creatures are born of the female of the species; without her none can exist.’

You will discover that school and grades are not everything. Yes, you will have a fluke genius moment and get 100% on your first calculus test when you were sure that you had no idea what you were doing. (It was short-lived and lasted only for that one test). It is not so much what you are learning, but the work ethic that you learn from your dedication to school and extra curricular activities that keeps you moving forward and rising to the top; and, ultimately allows you to enjoy life to its fullest.
Embrace is a fast paced, heart pounding, magical story. I haven’t read many books that center around witches especially male witches but I can tell you that I want to read more of them now.
Here’s a suggestion. As long as you’re looking for a mentor, how about going right to the top? There’s someone who’s a master at forgiveness. In fact, he’s forgiven more mistakes, malevolence, and pure meanness than you can shake a stick at. I’m talking about, of course about Jesus. At thirty-three years of age, he was brutally tortured to an untimely death. His dying words? “Father, forgive them, they don’t know what they’re doing.”
One huge advantage to working with a company that offers its vendors multiple snapshots of sales throughout the day and that offers easy, remote access for adjusting price and promotion is being able to react quickly to market changes. If, say, your free promotion and launch don't go as well as expected, you can simply let your introductory price ride. Then perhaps the next time your book goes free, you can consider a repricing strategy.
Many years ago - so long that I can’t even remember how old he might have been at the time - Paul had an unlucky incident at the hairdressers. His ear was cut by the scissors. He leapt out of the chair, refused to sit down again, and has continued to refuse to let anybody other than me go anywhere near his hair with a pair of scissors since. Except last Christmas, when he let his biggest little sister cut it, which was a huge display of trust towards her.

The Kentucky Giant was but another illustration of the truth of this position. He had a weakness in the region of the knees, and a trustfulness in his long face, which appealed even to five-feet nine for encouragement and support. He was only twenty-five years old, he said, and had grown recently, for it had been found necessary to make an addition to the legs of his inexpressibles. At fifteen he was a short boy, and in those days his English father and his Irish mother had rather snubbed him, as being too small of stature to sustain the credit of the family. He added that his health had not been good, though it was better now; but short people are not wanting who whisper that he drinks too hard.

In their study, the researchers hypothesized that when it comes to CFTR dysfunction the nervous system may try to compensate by overproducing one of several neuropeptides. Their research shows that the neuropeptide called CGRP is excessively produced by glands in an attempt to activate CFTR, but because of the lack of CFTR activity in cystic fibrosis the CGRP signal remains on.
So this study concludes that those farmers who switched over to biotech were the ones who were spraying with pesticides instead of using organic methods. Therefore, the study is going to extrapolate how much pesticide those people who did not use organic methods would have used, had they continued to use pesticides.
I remember reading in World War Z by Max Brooks that the thing about zombies is that you can't negotiate with them. There is nothing they want more than to eat your brains. So any militaristic strategies go out the window. For a zombie, there is no threat of collateral damage that could keep them at bay. And every force you send against them could potentially turn into more zombies. Zombies are relentless.

With most families torn in so many different directions, you may think it’s impossible to have a daily family table experience. My encouragement would be to start small. Consider carving out one night a week that is set aside for no plans other than dinner together as a family and sharing life and faith. You might even consider celebrating a holiday or having a meal that has a biblical precedent to encourage faith talks.

One minor Office Dibble: the 3d was good but I want to see it in 2d – the ‘Real 3d’ was a real pain, too dark and gloomy and not that exciting. When will they stop selling this half assed, misguided technology.

At first, especially before viewing the Whole Woman DVD, I found the Laselle exerciser more annoying and discouraging than anything else. It seemed like it didn't matter what I did, but the exerciser would not stay positioned and I'd have to reposition it every few minutes.
We are preparing our hearts and home to celebrate the birth of Christ... and also the arrival of our new daughter! Advent was already my favorite season of the year. It is just all the more glorious this year. As we near our travel time, I thought I would post this little note my husband, Scott, wrote to the Orphan Care Ministry at our church as it says so simply what I often try to say in too many words :-) And the post by David Platt so beautifully exalts the God who first loved us.
I personally struggle to make a title look halfway decent on my home videos which makes me admire Mr. Lawson’s work a ton. He has to put together elaborate, exciting, and flawless special effects and the best part is unlike other special effects teams who work many months to years on a project he completes his in a fraction of the time and budget and wins awards!

Overall, the domestic adjusted OIBDA margin decreased 71 basis points to 21.7 percent for the quarter. Excluding the previously disclosed August 2010 change in our QCard program with GE Capital Retail Bank which negatively impacted adjusted OIBDA by about $3 million for the quarter, the US adjusted OIBDA increased slightly and the adjusted OIBDA margin decreased 46 basis points in the third quarter.
The seamen on that fated vessel didn’t verbalise their heart’s cry. But God heard that silent plea. “What must I do to be saved?” Paul, as God’s spokesman gave the answer. “Be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you.”

7) At this point now some of you are telling me we ought to engage politically because Jesus says render unto Caesar. But lets look closely at the what Jesus really says. I am taking the text here from Matthew but Jesus’ words are the same in Mark and Luke:

When an entrepreneur introduces a new service or product to the market, there ought to all the time be a demand for it. In any other case, you won’t be able to make a sale. Even in the event you suppose that you have discovered the very best business alternative, in all probability probably the most innovative and helpful service/product, it will mean nothing when you’ve got no market or people prepared to purchase them. You will be unable to earn enormous earnings with out market demand.
All the papers have been machine sewn. I discovered a top tip (tuesday) whilst sewing. I have started mid way down the straight side, that way I get a nicer corner, and you can't see the join. I also wind the machine by hand, rather than use the pedal when I reach a corner - so much more control.
I worked in tones of YG11, YR12, YR15, YR04, and YR21, with shadows of YR18 and YR27. The blue/gray is B52 and BG72 with hints of C3 and BV31. The scanner did not pick up all the subtleties. However, I like how rich and vibrant the golds and yellows came out. In testing colors I liked the combination of the vibrant orange with the lime-green color on his fringe.

Many people have asked why I chose to leave Cartoon Network. I wish I could tell you that it was because I found out my boss was really a pirate, or that I got into a fist fight with both Finn and Jake. Maybe management decided to rent my office out, and then asked me to work on the parking garage. But no, there wasn't anything like that.

He told me again that I was going to get a very serious punishment spanking. He told me that I had done several things wrong and so he would punish me several different times. He sounded like he had really put some thought into this. Like he had four whole days to think about it or something. He asked me if I wanted to say anything. I just cried and looked away shaking my head no. He dropped his hands and said for me to take off my jeans and please don't argue.

She's my girl, and there could never be another like her. I could never get tired of looking at her soft curves, or hearing her sweet voice. I glance at others, but they don't tempt me. Nothing else could feel so right, or respond to my touch the way she does.

Now that I have the Boot, I am realizing what good company I am in. Hardly a day goes by that I don’t see someone else hobbling around the base in a matching appliance, and I am on a really small base. The hills here are steep and brutal luring many runners to injury.

Serve piping hot with steamed rice , unfinished portion can be kept in the same slow cooker overnight for next day consumption. The taste of the cooked trotter in fact taste even better if kept overnight. I love my rice soaked with the thick and fragrant vinegar sauce and I can even drink the sauce on its own....heavenly.
Just because your caterer offers you a dozen or more stations and passed hors d'oeuvres doesn't mean you have to serve all of them. It's really a huge waste of food because your guests won't be able to eat an entire dinner after filling up at the cocktail hour.

My biggest issue with this new building is that presedent is being established as a result of the process that is allowing this plan to go forward and that presedent opens the door to an overwrought unremarkable city.

It is worth remembering that change cannot be imposed from without. It requires movement within the target organization as well. You want to encourage reform, to encourage the institution to develop a culture of ethics. For example, every organization should have not only a “mission statement,” as in “we want to make a lot of money,” but also a code of acceptable behavior, which states: “but in this effort we will not engage in the following acts …”

I can honestly say that last part of the climb was one of the hardest physical trials I’ve out myself through. It really highlighted the problems with the gear ratio.
It took us just under an hour to get back down. I thought the going down was worse than the going up. I find going downwards is a lot harder on my joints and by the end, my knee which I had injured previously in the week was starting to hurt quite a lot. But I was glad we made the whole trip in under the estimated time because it meant we could still see a bit more before it got too dark.
In this particular article, I liked his response to the question, “How do you find time to write?”:
Besides being a YouTube personality, Toby (also a close friend of iJustine, and confirmed-to-be-fake girlfriend) has also tried his hands at acting and stand-up comedy. He was born in March 1985, a couple months before the primetime release of Super Mario Bros. His first video demonstrated what Toby would do with the remote from Click (released on the same day of the video), and its quick popularity gave Toby his YouTubing start. That video currently has over 400,000 views. Believe it or not, Tobuscus was not Toby’s first-ever channel; it instead was his “LazyVlog” second channel, TobyTurner, launched a month before Tobuscus. 4 years later, TobyGames, the third out of 3 channels, came to be and became Toby’s official gaming channel, since his gaming videos were originally on TobyTurner. His most famous video remains the Literal Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood trailer at over 20 million views. TobyGames ranks #83 on the top 100 YouTubers’ list at 899 thousand subscribers, matter of fact, even beating David Guetta’s channel. Lemme show you some examples of what you would find @ all 3 of his channels:

First, let’s look at verse 60: “Many of his disciples said, ‘This is very hard to understand. How can anyone accept it?’” I wonder how many people today walk away from Jesus because His teaching is too hard to understand? Without the help of the Holy Spirit and more mature Christians, some of what Jesus says is very hard to understand. But the core of His message is not. He came to save sinners by His sacrifice of Love, and He calls His followers to trust in Him alone for their salvation.
Hi everybody. I am participating in a blog tour for six amazing authors! I have read and reviewed one of the six books being showcased here, and absolutely loved it!! I still can't stop talking about it, and I read it a few months ago now. That book was Paradox: The Angels Are Here by Patti Roberts. I have since started to read Tomorrows Child by Starr West, and so far am loving it! The others all sound amazing, and I will be reading them all and reviewing them here on my blog!!
Saturday found me crossing here on the way to ‘suss out’ the goings on at Cookham Regatta. As I crossed I managed to catch the ‘ Magna-Carta’, a floating hotel, on it’s way upstream from London to Henley. A week on here will put you back a ‘pretty penny’ but for some reason seems to be priced in American dollars!
On the other hand, when I look in the mirror, now I like the person who looks back.
I’ve got to admit there are not a lot of entertainers I’ve actually shed tears hearing upon their deaths. I have felt deeply saddened but just a few had me literally crying. Dean Martin who I adored was one on them, Johnny Carson was another and Wednesday hearing that Dick Clark had died and watching the footage from the earliest shows of American Bandstand made many of tears flow throughout the day and night.
I poured it into the perfect beer glass: the ones Jim Koch reportedly spent $100,000 to design and produce.
Although the above verse probably echoed in the mind of Woolley when he made the discovery, most critics today will argue that judging by the horns and coat of the animal in the statuette, it is more likely to have been a goat - an animal noted for its endurance and sexual potency. The 'ram' or goat is shown reaching up to nibble at the branches of a shrub or bush - a common sight in the ancient Near East.
Like a man in a dream, Luu tapped the switches for flares, radiation homing, jamming, channel hop, and AESA, and watched as his plane swooped towards the ground.

One of the hardest things about parenting for me? Is letting go.
For those of you that are unfamiliar with Delaware, we have a very large summer resort area known as the Delaware Beaches. It is an area that starts up near Milford with access to Slaughter Beach, and stretches down through Lewes, into Rehoboth Beach, and then down into Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, and finally Fenwick Island. The largest concentration of vacationers flock into the Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach area, which also happens to be the mecca for businesses in the resort area.
And I have been fluffy ALLLLL winter.
As progressive as I think the UK is on many social and economic matters, something like this creeps up that just makes me smack my forehead and shake my head in complete and utter confusion.
Saturday was spent going thru mom's things and taking everything to charity that we didn't want, as well as gathering the things the family needs to go thru. We had moved furniture around in our house to make a room for mom, so now everything is back in its place.
So on the way back from the city a few weeks ago I came across this bit of furniture in one of our local charity shops.
I go back to work in less than two weeks (half-time as a R.V.T.). I am also starting my photo biz in about two weeks (I have an ad coming out in a local baby expo...so I'll be goin' public. For Real Life. So scary). I am also taking this great course over at Big Picture Scrapbooking which is showing me a great way to get all my gabillions of photos (paper and digital) organized so that I can actually start scrapbooking them. That course is a LOT of work, though. And, when it is over I actually want to start, you know, scrapbooking.

A big motivation was hearing we were pregnant with twins.
Mark, who had been quiet so far, now spoke up. He said that he hadn't appreciated the humour, either. He found a joke of Tom's - Tom calls greasy cheeseburgers 'cheesy greaseburgers', if I recall correctly - simply puerile, rather than, as I do, amusing and heart-lifting evidence of Tom's ability to move from gloomy academically-couched existential angst to simple life-affirming humour. In fact, Mark, said, he hadn't liked the book at all. He said he had to admit that this was largely because as an admirer of Auster's previous style, he was disappointed by the change, but also he thought it sentimental. He didn't, as most of us did, find the book touching. He didn't think the nine-year-old niece's mutism credible - though he also announced that he hadn't found the book worth finishing, so he would have missed the explanation provided at the end. He said he strongly agreed with John's suggestion that this book had been written cynically to commission as a 9/11 book and had failed.

Of course, these days, if something is fun or "too mainstream", some assholes have to come along and try to ruin it for everyone else. Enter AntiCupid, who I can only assume is blue and needs to be trapped away in a special holding field. AntiCupid is the brainchild of all those people who feel spurned or unloved on Valentine's day. All failed relationships and dating problems are AntiCupid's fault, because, you know, it's not you, loser, it's clearly the work of some nefarious godling. AntiCupid's arrows lead to hours of whiny music, cutting and a predilection toward wearing black clothing. His Greek counterpart is "Emos".

Obviously I listened intently. Even at the age of 2 or 3, I knew this conversation was of significance and importance. Processing the information was the difficult bit. 30 years later I am still processing the information, to some extent.
I found this lotion in a local coffee shop called "Third Street Stuff" and I just couldn't resist! Yes, I bought it...and yes I put it on!!! At first I laughed my head off and bought one for everyone I know. But then after a few sips of my coffee I got to thinking?

So because the Asian community was so by need tight-knit, the next thing you know I have Asian kids following me around, you know doing more shit for me than the boys that wanted inside of me. Especially the two in particular. They thought I was “so wonderful” which sickened me even further. I was not wonderful, it reminds me of that quote, from WWII era forget it but goes on to say something like, “It was not that I was a hero, it was everyone around me was acting so badly” when someone won a humanitarian award.

I am 2 episodes behind watching the latest episode of Mad Men, but today is not the day to catch up on my TV. I had to leave the house to get anything done. I packed my laptop, screen filter, adaptor and all the paper docs I might possibly need. I brought along name cards, you know, just in case. I like to hear to the soft conversations and that occasional mobile ring across the cafe as I type along. It is very comforting to feel like I am still connected to the outside, even though I am deeply engaged to the virtual social world loading on my laptop. And then I felt the need to do a blog post.
An example of how traditional towns are alive and not ossified or museums is Kings Lynn. It has rows of historic buildings near the Great River Ouse and in use. Architecture and history merge here and the locals have a living history and belong to something enduring. I often criticise councillors for treating their cities as personal property to dispose of at will but I must pay homage to a Kings Lynn councillor. She saw me rapt in taking photographs and came to ask me what I thought of the buildings. “Breathtaking” I replied. We talked about its beauty and she told of the fight to keep it and how many locals “don’t know what they have”. Unfortunately I was pre-occupied with photography and she was in company and so did not get her name. But I pay homage to this lady with both taste and the conviction to stand up for these marvellous buildings.

And let’s not forget about Mulletville Corp. Good God, they’d probably sue the pants (and red lacy underwear) right off me for outing the staff and their incompetencies. I’d be cast out into the parking lot and egged as I drove away. My name would be scum.
You asked a question and the immediate reaction was, no you can't, why do you think about something like that, it is a waste of time or you might even get an immediate thrashing. Knowledge, I learned was not universal, it was linked and channeled to a certain mindset. You dare to think out of that little square and you'll be pulled in the mouth.

Keep an eye too on all the petty crimes that are occurring….pensioners being beaten to death for $3000.00. Fashion designers being robbed of small amounts of cash and electronic items for a quick sale on the black market. The petty crime toll is edging back up…but no one announces that in the paper…is just who feels it knows it. So, those of us whose cars will be stolen, cell phones, laptops, handbags, will wonder where is the crime plan? Where’s the 21st Century Policing? How is it helping us….and then when we turn around and realise gang warfare still rampant as ever, only weed getting seized, but never any cocaine…..and no white collar criminal is ever held accountable we will become more and more depressed, more and more frustrated, more and more fed up of watching Kamla and her Family Values team gorge themselves on the public purse.
Sometimes, when a film release gets pushed forward, it can be a good thing – an extra week for promotions, less competition at the box office and for the avid film fan, some breathing space that allows one to catch up with multiple releases and stay ahead of the pack. But that extra week can also prove an ominous sign – as I found out last year with Anjaana Anjaani which also had its release pushed forward – I was super excited about the film but that extra week killed any kindness I had and AA was simply not worth the wait. Furthermore, it was trumped by the Hollywood release I had gone to see in its place (which in this case was The Town). So when I had a sense of déjà vu for Mausam which was preponed, things did not bode well. So, in place of Mausam, I saw Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy which I really enjoyed and I even managed to squeeze in a screening of Drive (which I fell for big time – totally my kind of film) so that when I went to see Mausam, all the bad ju-ju would be gotten rid of and there wasn’t any pressure for the film to be spectacular.
March 23, 2013! One year from the day he proposed to me. I'm still sad that the proposal was so shocking that I can't remember everything he said but I think setting our date on March 23rd is a sweet way to acknowledge our engagement.
Finally done my presentation for one of my classes, which means I can concentrate on crafts and painting and organizing! Woohoo! For about half a second because I also have a midterm in 2 weeks, bleh.
Can I admit something shameful? I've never visited Jackson Heights! It's perhaps one of the most written about areas of Queens for its food, its street culture, its vibrancy and life, and yet, I've never been! Shame on myself! Luckily I came to this date armed with three, count em three, issues of Time Out New York featuring Queens, Cheap Eats, and Ethnic Foods, so I'd know where to hit among the clatter and bang that overtakes such an intersection of the world. We selected Tibetan cuisine, as Tom had never before tried the food of yak-country (which was all I ate when I was there a few years ago), so we walked into the brightest florescent packed Merit Kabab Palace and headed to the back counter of Tashi Delek Momo, which serves up a combination of Chinese delights with a Tibetan twist. Even the rallying students would have to approve.

PRAISE GOD!
When the world sees the Christian Church as a whole it seems the one thing that often jumps out at them is our hypocrisy. Now, I understand that all Believers are guilty of hypocrisy to some extent. I am just as guilty of this as anyone reading this post. But when the culture sees the Church they cannot get past the fact that many of us are preaching one thing and doing another. This takes place in a number of different ways, but the one that has convicted me most recently is the lack of help for the poor.
We started construction on a new kitchen on August 8th. Then we stopped because we had to fight about it. Then we started again three days later. Let’s just say that we have the most patient contractor that ever lived. He’s used to us fighting about a project. He knows that once the fight is over, things will go just fine.
A very minor one. I think few of the other nobles truly consider me to be one. I actually got kicked into a moat once by a knight who was insulted by the very idea that I could be considered a noble.
McLaren continued the 2010 design of snowplough nosecone and split front wing into 2011 with the MP4-26. Again later in the year, the wing was simplified for the Indian GP with similar endplates and cascades, but the complex split shape wing profile was changed to be straight across its width.
Have your children ever been in a community where Christmas is not celebrated? Have they played with children who don’t know what a cross symbolizes? Spending time in an immigrant community allows them to see the church with fresh eyes. They can worship with believers from other cultures and share with unbelievers. And most likely they’ll feel more comfortable sharing their faith at home, too.

Also, when he was in the hospital in September 2009, he told me to copy everything on his computer on memory sticks in case he didn’t make it then. He said now I will need to use all of it. I said yes but I was not about to go into detail of all the photos he gave me and I was not going to glorify what he & I both knew was nonsense. I would concentrate on what I knew for fact and lived with him through and I told him it was not going to be the original book he planned, rather a combination of that draft but now with Mexico added and the full truth about everything & everyone that I had encountered in his life from the beginning.

Having reared children during the Depression years, they knew the value of money and tried to teach us grandkids to care for things. They hated to see you throw something of limited value away, for fear you might need it later. For this reason the toys they kept in the closets grandkids were allowed to play in, weren’t the best, or the newest, but we made do, as they taught us to use our imaginations.

She wore her sunglasses in the car and mostly looked at her knees,managing to blank out the world quite effectively. She didn't see the crying baby, or the early morning drunk. The church was busy. A lump came to her throat as soon as she went through the door. She gasped at the warmth, and then shook at the fear. As she sat down on the pew she felt waves of emotion. Glancing round the church, she tried to identify the source of each. She was in awe of the hope of the pious young man, his head bent in supplication. She shuddered at the guilt of the plain looking man two rows in front, and at the fear of her mother, whose eyes were firmly closed.

But here, I can only see how it can be done exploitatively, with the aim of getting the schmuck to come back for more, and pay more money. What I have is, after all, a series of paragraphs strung together from a word-processing program, automatically, including my name at intervals, and a name for an astrologer who has putatively created this personally for me, and repeatedly refers to herself as “Your Professional Astrologer and friend”. It tells me that there is a major transit, a rare planetary motion, over the next three months, which will mark a decisive turning point in my love life and also my material wealth. However a transit can reinforce weak points, preventing growth and impeding progress, if the subject is not fully aware of their influence. This happened to me, it/”she” says, in 2008, when I was not aware of a transit, missed its opportunities, and this has caused blocks for me ever since. I need a guide I can trust. How wonderful that the universe has brought me to it, so it can guide me through this transit, and I will not suffer in the same way this time!

If so, pony up some money for The Greatest Beers of the World, a fundraiser for the American Red Cross. A friend of mine up there is a co-chair of the event, and the keynote speaker is from Victory Brewing Co., one of America's best breweries (in fact, I was drinking a bottle of their Hop Wallop just last night). The info promises a sampling of up to 100 brands of beer! (I'm sure "up to" is the key phrase there – I'd be needing some help from the Red Cross if I tried to sample that many in just one night.)
Politicians have done many unforgivable things over the years, but so far they've managed not to initiate a thermonuclear holocaust.

According to the WSJ:
The events led to a serious global recession which affected not just the main rich nations but many emerging economies too. Another result was a massive injection of funds from governments to prevent the world financial system from collapse. The shockwaves from the subsequent soaring public sector debt in many countries, necessitating in many cases in big cutbacks in government programmes, will be felt for much of the coming decade.

Until then, this is the next best thing. Those who have been lucky enough to have seen the excised video say it's one of Helen's best.

She is definitely a horse that is going to teach me a lot about riding as I will be bringing her along under saddle. I find myself telling her with each ride- "This is not all about you, you know. I need to work on things too." I have issues with my riding as we all do. Fix one thing and something else needs work.

Leftists, of course, have always been happy to misrepresent conservatism as resistance to ALL change -- something that all conservative thinkers that I know of explicitly reject -- including both Edmund Burke and Disraeli (as we shall see) -- but even conservative intellectuals these days are still sometimes misled by Disraeli's old propaganda trick (see e.g. here or here) and assume that the PRIME aim of conservatives is to conserve -- but in so doing they simply show their ignorance of history. There are only SOME things that conservatives want to conserve and those things that conservatives do want to conserve they want to conserve for a reason, not as an end in itself. And the end they seek is safety and liberty for the individual to live his own life in his own way with minimal interference from others and from the State. They realize that the State and society generally are sometimes needed to secure that freedom but do not lose sight of the fact that freedom for the individual is the end of political policy, not an optional extra. And present day politics are much like the politics of Disraeli's day. Conservatives don't want to conserve our disastrous educational and social welfare systems, they want to reform them. And they want to reform them by empowering the individual -- just as conservatives have always done.

The grace I’m talking of is about loving someone in their weakest, ugliest, or most unlovable moments. And rather than punishing them … we let it go, on purpose and without malice. It’s about honoring their intention and the person we know them to be, which is good, even if in the moment they were not successful at showing it. That’s the grace I try to give, and I know I need the most.
I’ve been thinking recently about the “insignificant-due-to-survival” effect. I can’t help but feel that now that all is said and done, and the transplant was successful, everything that I’ve been through (my bipolar diagnosis to which there is no cure, my cancer treatment, my rehabilitation and recovery) is “not that big a deal” because I survived. As if really, I’m okay today, so how bad could it really have been? What one experiences gives you so much character and nobody will ever fully know to what extent you innately comprehend and empathize with others, which is a great deal. Your experiences give you an understanding that the majority doesn’t share. It’s a blessing and a curse. I ponder sometimes, if ignorance really is bliss. I’m sorry for those who feel diminished in comparison to others’ experiences. Our experiences make us so uniquely individual yet so universally relevant.

Cancer comedy. It doesn’t really seem like those two words should be grouped together. It would also make people take a step back and ponder whether any movie that is a cancer comedy would work. Surprisingly not only does it work, but it was a great film. The comedy and seriousness blend together to make a touching movie that doesn’t get too depressing but still offers genuine human emotions. Joseph Gordon Levitt is great and Seth Rogen proves that he does have a deft touch to be able to act when he wants.
For the last two decades or so, our hamburger meat has been “beefed up” with filler made from ground-up, ammonia-treated beef scraps, sinew and connective tissue.

But recent media reports about this “pink slime” are making people take a closer look at what they’re eating.

I thought that the hands-on activities were very good for helping students understand how graph can show a relationship between numbers. A typical math book has kids graphing coordinates, but may not help them understand that the resulting line shows a defined relationship between the numbers. Every activity that we’ve done so far requires hands-on measurement, graphing the results, then coming up with an equation that explains the data. Follow-up discussion questions are asked that require the student to understand the task and to predict results when the variables are changed. We did run into a problem in one of the early lessons, when the questions expected knowledge of terms such as domain, range, and dependent variable that hadn’t been taught yet. We had to look at the teacher’s guide to find out the correct answers.

In part, this will have been a hangover from Monday with the players mentally aware of the price paid for being hit on the counter-attack. The gap between the back four and midfield triumverate was minimal. This was compounded by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s reduced effectiveness when forced into the more central midfield role; searing pace is something which is hard to exploit in a crowded area of the pitch. More penatrative in the latter stages when on the flanks, the youngster will get more opportunities with the season-ending injury to Theo Walcott.

When going to Rome, except from eating excellent food there is an obligation to visit the ruins and nonetheless St Peterus Square. The Vatican museum is where you go if you are really interested in art (or not), but it is an experience like no other if I may say so. In the museum you can find maps on how the Romans believed the world looked like, which is awfully well done except when it came to the north. Scandinavia is like a blurry island, which showed how far they travelled. They new that there was something in the north, but the investigation was probably not existing. This is basically the only way you can stand in the Sistine Chapel and have a glance of the work of Michelangelo which is breathtaking really. Not breathtaking like the most beautiful thing you have ever seen, but in ‘I can’t believe that he did all of this’ kind of way. When going to see this you believe that the classic The Creation of Adam is going to be bigger than it really is, which hit me when I saw it. But of course if you don’t want to have a humongous cuddle party in a air conditioned room with people you don’t know then you can watch the Sistine Chapel here http://www.vatican.va/various/cappelle/sistina_vr/index.html.

So I had the radio, and by this time I had also discovered comic books. And I think those two outlets, really influenced and educated me in what I do today. I loved the stories of the superhero's and of the Archie and Veronica books. With the radio, I started to create visually in my head what I was being deprived of while listening, images of emotion. It was a movie in my head, that was always running. There was a program called THE LUX RADIO THEATER ON THE AIR and one night, they presented a play called, LUX PRESENTS HOLLYWOOD. So listening, laying on my bed, I decided that I was gonna go to the movies. There was something magical about what I was hearing on the radio, and it was putting images of the stories in my head. I started telling my mother that I was gonna go out to Hollywood and make movies. I was telling her this when I was around 7 or 8 years old. My mom, would look at me and say, "What are you talking about, eat your soup."

This afternoon I had the dreaded visit to have my ingrown toenail seen to. I was not looking forward to it at all, but anyone who has had one will know how painful they are. I hobbled into the surgery and the first hurdle was having to climb two flights of stairs. On meeting the chiropodist I was stunned to recognise him as a farmer who used to live in our village ! I had a grin to myself as I had a mental image of him grabbing my foot and clamping it between his knees as though I was one of his cattle or horses !! However the grin did not last for long once I was settled on the couch with my poor painful toe exposed to the gaze of the expert !! I have to admit that I sat there as rigid as a tree trunk, trying not to look at the array of evil looking implements lined up alongside my throbbing toe !! I do believe I lost a good pint in perspiration and gritted my teeth so hard that they are now about an inch deeper into my jaw than they used to be !! I must admit though that the relief was fantastic once the offending nail was cut away from my skin, how on earth can a small piece of nail cause such pain ? I almost skipped down the stairs and practically danced back to the car.

Bali Rai asked, "Are we creating a fear of YA fiction in parents and schools?" His new book Honour Killing is making a huge impact in the British Asian community and opening doors for discussion about this difficult issue amongst teenagers all over the country. This is a very controversial area that was little known about until only a few years ago. Books can open the door for teenagers to engage in such issues. Shannon Park backed this up by saying, "There has never been a time when YA books have been more relevant." In relation to the book, Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, dealing with teenage suicide, Shannon quoted a teenager who told Asher, "I may not have been here if I had not read your book."

But the measures have fueled a succession of fiscal shocks that are being felt across the Syrian economy, so far without directly endangering Assad’s 12-year rule, analysts say. These include not only a jump in consumer prices but a sharp drop in the value of the Syrian pound. Wages have stayed stagnant.” – Washington Post 4/24/2012

Also, that the term in Old German was “ôstra, ôstrara, ôstrarûn; German, Ostern” (Keep in mind the term Ostrara, which is derived from Astara). The Greek term for Easter, pascha, has nothing in common with the verb paschein, “to suffer,” although by the later symbolic writers it was connected with it (i.e., the Church)”

Don’t trust weather reports, because temperatures feel massively different once you add humidity (It actually got cooler as the day went on)! I didn’t actually get water at any stop, but it was a great idea because a lot of first-timers ran this, and with multiple aid stations, if someone had a heat related medical issue, the volunteers could help.
Sounds fun, huh? I think so. There are some concerns noted in Mosher's article, the most pressing, in my opinion, is the color of the second beer. The runnings may be a bit light, so Mosher suggests a mini-mash on the side to get to the desired color. Depending on the style, a longer boil of the second runnings could also help achieve a darker color, but may affect the final volume of the beer, let alone the flavor. That sounds like another experiment for another post.

That day remains a blur – I keep getting pieces of information from various doctors and people to try and put together their birth story. Colton came out first because he apparently edged himself in front of his sister. Both cried when they were pulled out and Colton’s APGAR scores were 7 and then 8. I don’t have Keltie’s yet.

I found a few things. Some Sunday pants for Jim, a pair of jammie pants for Joe, an Easter dress for Eme, a baby doll dress/shirt for Emeline. Not too much. Mostly, I just had fun looking around and goofing off.
When it got chilly in the evenings, we lit a big log fire in the fire place and played silly games or watched DVD’s and dozed. On other evenings we made the expedition into one of the surrounding towns or villages and went and found wonderful local food. The annual Natale celebration was going on in Ostuni, and we went and took part in the parade of people admiring the nativity scenes and visiting the cathedral.

The small group of writers who contributed to WSAS are brave and honourable men, but they all have young families, lives and jobs in South Africa, and they have decided between themselves that, as the threat has now become so real, they can no longer continue to put their lives and families at such risk in the violent, and increasingly totalitarian state where they still reside. Hence Why South Africa Sucks has now been closed down, which is a sad loss to the internet and to the cause of free speech everywhere.
The biggest scene was Bilbo meeting Gollum. Despite being told what we were seeing were unfinished effects, Gollum looked great (and again, the 48fps gave him more of a sense of being actually there). The scene was cut a little slackly; I imagine the final version will be tighter. But it was good.
As I entered the transition area, I had to get out of my wetsuit and then run to the port-a-pottie! I don't know why - but I ALWAYS have to pee after I get out of the water. I heard some athletes discussing how they just pee in their wetsuit in the water, but YUCK! First, my wetsuit cost a lot of money. Second, I have several more miles in front of me and I can't smell like pee the entire time. So, after peeing . . . my stupid left hand was still a claw and I had a heck of a time trying to get my shoes on, zipping up my cycling jersey . . . it was comical. But I got on that bike and out of the transition area.

Vickie's Fiesta - October 15
It's quite likely that I will be out of a job in eighteen months or so. The funding cuts announced by the government in the wake of the Browne review are particularly savage in the subject area where I work, and in the kind of institution where I work. The emphasis on the so-called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) subjects means that, in effect, arts and humanities subjects are going to be denied any funding at all, and will have to survive on vastly increased student fees. The real terms cut for a department like mine in the sector of the university market we are in is about 98%. Whether there is a pool of students prepared to pay those fees is another matter, and it seems clear that lots of departments will close, and it is by no means inconceivable that entire universities will have to shut up shop. And, you know, I somehow don't think that will be Oxford and Cambridge. Already, redundancies have been announced, and I know of several institutions where departing staff are simply not being replaced.
Not best pleased, the police made him put his lorry away and carted him off to the local nick for a full and frank discussion of events.
I don’t remember who said this, that every weapon that we use can be turned against ourselves. We operate in a capitalist society. So, if we really want to escape this kind of society we should maybe not start from architecture, but from different things, such as direct political action. I think architecture is a really compromissory activity in itself. It’s in the middle of dynamics which are much stronger than the architect and his/her ideas. But at the same time there still is a little freedom of action, for producing visions, for interfering with these dynamics.

Took the Lincoln for a quick spin and pulled into a parking lot to check the idle speed, I was approached by a guy who wanted to know all about the car. Turns out he was a big Ford fan. I spoke freely and didn't hide my knowledge of cars, did he read me, didn't seem to be any indication but then again Canadians are known to be awfully polite. Same thing happened two weeks ago with the Buick, that time I was positive I passed but they guy didn't clearly know what to make of a woman so into cars.

The police and government will not look at the issue of organised rape by Asian Muslim gangs against underage white girls, the councils do not have a duty in law to protect the families and re-home them if they give evidence against these gangs and sexual terrorists, the social services are not warning foster carers to keep the young children in their care away from Asian males who may be threatening them for fear of political correctness and the government has not ordered a public inquiry into the levels of sexual terrorism and the rape of young white girls by Muslim gangs in the UK.

Though recently published Alcoholics Anonymous literature has meticulously erased Jesus Christ, the Bible, and over a decade of A.A. cures from specific mention, AA pioneers were cured! Many said so. Reports about their program cures said so. Countless news and journal articles said so. And—whatever current A.A. scribes and history revisionists may say—cure is the proper word. And cured they were. They believed in the power of God. They believed they could be cured. And, if the following verses from such devotionals as The Runner’s Bible provided a source for their approach, they were believing what the Creator said:
Someday, and that day may never come, I’ll call upon you to do a service for me. ~Vito Corleone
As far as stage names, sometimes finding an easier name to optimize, choosing a name that is different from some one else’s that already has a presence online or in the industry can be good too.

Romans 3:24-26 says ”and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished — he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus”.
Pretty impressive list huh??

Dear Kory,
3. I did a marathon 3 days before I turned 40. I race-walked/powerwalked it in 5:52. It was a life goal - my dad was a marathoner, who died at age 55. It was also a tribute to him and I cried when I crossed the finish line, and my mom was there to put my medal around my neck.

Of course, the reality is that governments and business have been interacting since capitalism became the dominant economic system. The Anti-Combination Acts of 1799/1800 was the British government acting on behalf of industry against the working class and its trade unions.

I stopped calling my parents daily and made it to once a week. I did not want to keep the nostalgic moments entering my minds when I am far. This extended further and now I call them when they ring back asking my whereabouts. I love my parents and want to keep close with them but I am also a victim of the busy corporate world. This is the reason I can give to the people who ask for the causes of not calling them. But I know that’s not true.
Yes, it’s a gamble you have to be willing to take, but I’m a Finance girl: look at the market return – 50% plus divorce rate?! Most unmarried people I see break up/cheating on each other too?! & Besides observing all of that, my own damn experiences of being cheated on after giving my all? NO THANKS. Those aren’t good odds and not worth my investment (and a fine one it is too LOL jk I meant my heart/time…) I know you have to be willing to take the bad to get to enjoy all of the good stuff, but too often it starts out like that…and you think everything is great…then boom, the bad starts to outweigh the good. So you gotta break up. But if you’re married instead, that means divorce. And marriage is a one-shot deal to me…
Hi everyone!
I pulled the vent up and smelled inside the vent.
Another hour goes by. You begin to lose your grip. Your arms begin to fall. You tell yourself to hold on, but your body just won’t respond. Down goes the rock. And just as it hits the pavement and breaks into a hundred pieces, your friend pulls up in the driveway. He jumps out of the car, runs over with a look of panic on his face, and says, “What happened? Did it slip? Did somebody knock it out of your hands? Did you change your mind?” And as he looks for an explanation as to why you suddenly dropped the rock, you know that it was a long time coming.
More often than not, the word ‘unity’ becomes a hallowed formulate expansively used by UMNO just before elections to win support. The word disappears from their political repository just after an election. Unity rhetoric is only for UMNO’s political expedient. In truth, national unity has virtually been shattered by the UMNO government.

Work on the trail continues. We’ve been removing rocks, cutting out roots, and then filling in the craters left by the removal of said rocks and roots. I have a sinking suspicion that we’ll be doing the exact same thing tomorrow and Friday. It’s dull and would be unbearable were it not for the quality of conversations that occur when a team collectively reaches that “slap happy” stage. We all have our Zombie Apocalypse strategies plotted out, we have all picked which appendage we would willingly saw off with a pocketknife in order to survive a 128 hours scenario, and we have all selected spirit animals. We’ve told embarrassing, stupid, hilarious and true stories. In the morning before we get too delirious, conversations are a bit more academic and sometimes resemble issue debates. But mostly it’s, “would you rather eat a cooked eyeball or a live cockroach?” and etc.

Even in the weakest moment of his life he called out to His Father and told him that he was afraid but did not mind going on in case His Father wanted him to go to face the dreadful death. Jesus had the ascertainment of gains and losses. He trusted His Father. Even in case God wanted that His son would give his life, Jesus was willing to go on the ‘offerings-table’ like Isaac (Yitsḥaq ) giving all his heart. Perhaps Jesus did not see any absolute necessity for his suffering more than the sinner suffered in order to pay man’s ransom price.

Three days later the stone was rolled away. The tomb was empty. And Jesus was alive. And the wolf had to face the bitter truth that he wasn’t the one who took Jesus’ life…….Jesus was the one who gave it up. And Jesus is the one who gave it back. That the wolf’s most powerful tool…….that the wolf’s most destructive force…….death…..has no power what so ever over Christ. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost rule and reign over death as well. So in bitter defeat the wolf slunk away. Now he just lashes out more viciously……..trying to rip as many of us from God as he can.

Not so much a cafe, as a restaurant, I had a very good lunch of braised steak in red wine sauce, with seasonal root vegetables. The food is good, the surroundings a little drab, and the price? Significantly more than a good meal in the pub up the road, but I'd ordered before reading the prices.
That statement is a testament not only to their work ethic but also to the humility of the team, because at the end of the day, they did do so much more. The shared bond, selflessness, and love that each team member demonstrated not only left an impression over the course of the week, but will also help to continue Habitat’s mission in the future. The family values that brought the group of 14 from Canada to Argentina are mirrored reflections of the pillars that support HPHA and allow the organization to develop further: mutual assistance, volunteerism, and faith in action. So even though they left the last day wanting to do more, and leave an even bigger impact, from our perspective, they did exactly what they were meant to do- transform the lives of the community members and be transformed themselves. Thank you team! Daonce!

One of our favorite non-anime shows on television is Treme, in for no other reason than because for large chunks of the show, there is nothing happening save the playing of music. Jazz, Blues, R&B, Rock…Bounce…doesn’t matter; those moments are why I watch. No dialogue or plot can compare to the pure, primal, eclectic languages being spoken. This week, there was one of those moments: an impromptu jazz session; Kaoru’s first, which perfectly and effortlessly captures both his initial jitters, to finally settling down and having fun.

I’m one of those people who tends to set goals and forget about them a week later. I still think about and want to achieve my larger goals, but I forget about those small milestone goals I set to help me get to the larger ones. I had an awesome month in February, and as I sat back and reflected on it, I realized what helped me be so successful in February. It was that silly little tracking spreadsheet I did using Laura’s setup.

School, work, the kids, our mortgages and Kroger can crowd it’s cry out, temporarily blocking the ache its voice can revive. They tell us to give up on our childish dreams, abandon our hope for the very thing that makes us unique. It logically intones how irresponsible it would be for us to consider taking such risks with our families and our homes relying on us. (which they are) So we push its pulsing beat further down and away from our mind and focus on the task’s at hand. Fearful to pick it up again… wondering if that deep desire is God or something else…

What this means is that using free as a tool for discoverability is still a great option assuming your book gets into the Top 200 or so, but it rapidly loses its effectiveness otherwise. Note I said "for discoverability" and not "for gaining post-free sales." With the new algorithms and their accompanying new price bias, books likely need to get into the Top 150 Free to have any noticeable post-free sales bounce, and into the Top 80 to see an appreciable bounce.

If we were to have an official brew for the 81st session of the Texas Legislature, I'd nominate Old Chub Scottish Ale, for obvious reasons. Somehow, though, I suspect it wouldn't gain passage – aside from the fact that this beer comes from Colorado's Oskar Blues Brewery, and not a Texas beermaker, there's the additional problem that it might leave a bitter taste in Republicans' mouths. Too bad, it's a mighty tasty beer.

Yesterday on Twitter Katherine, Carolyn and I were discussing cowboy boots. I have two basic pairs, one black and one brown. Katherine then showed a picture of her awesome Boots which I decided I had to have. I currently wear my boots with my jeans over them, however if I am going to spend money on boots this awesome I want to see them! The problem is, I am not a fan of my legs in skinny jeans or leggings. Add to it that I am only 4'11" and my short legs look so chunky if my pants are tucked into boots. As a result, I just figured I would never buy the boots. But, if you follow me on Pinterest you know that I found tons of boots I loved yesterday. So, I made the decision I am going to have these boots and wear them no matter what it takes!

For women who are at risk of hormone-dependent breast cancer, Mushrooms may be an important diet addition.One cup of mushrooms provides a good, very good, or excellent source of 18 different vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant phytonutrients. To maximize their flavor and the retention of their nutrients it is important to not to overcook them and also make sure that color and texture changes in mushrooms over a 6-8 day period, including color changes that were associated with the mushrooms' phytonutrient content (discoloration was related to a reduction in these important nutrients so Always Plan to cook Mushroom at an early stage rather than causing discoloration in turn loosing all the nutrients .careful refrigeration of mushrooms as soon as you've arrived back home from the grocery store. Leaving mushrooms out on the countertop is worth avoiding, and you never want to store them even temporarily in a cabinet.

So his name is James, and he blogs about all sorts of things at Walking With God. And like most people whose blogs I check out, he has at least given thought to the idea of fostering. A few years back he and his wife, Christina, were avid meat eaters, along with eating everything else that is considered normal today. And while many people who knew them thought that would never change, things did change. They started getting educated, went to a few seminars that explained some of the basics about food, and did research themselves. They actually went to an all vegan diet! How well they have maintained it I am not sure. I do know, though, that they have been experiencing many positive benefits resulting from this education about diet and the way our bodies work. James started sleeping uninterrupted through the night for the first time in his LIFE, and his allergy symptoms also seemed to disappear, for starters. Anyway, this post comes after he did a 12 day cleanse, and some realizations and resolutions he came to at the end of it. You can read the whole thing here, but I’ve quoted the part that really resonated with me about sugar, the health of our children, and the willingness to just go out there and be a mean parent in everyone else’s eyes because you know what you’re doing is right and best.

I'd never been to Texas before, and no doubt my idea of the place was fairly similar to many another Englishwoman who has never visited. Cowboy hats and boots, tumbleweed, twangy accents and cattle. Of course I knew that there were cities in Texas, and skyscrapers, freeways and shopping malls, but I'm a child of the fifties, and was brought up on Dick West and the Lone Ranger. So of course I looked for signs of cowboys. They were easy enough to find. And along with the whites, in cowboy hats or not, there were of course Blacks, Hispanics, Chinese, the whole rainbow of peoples that makes a place vibrant.

Each page has it's own unique style and design! You will find clipped pages, lower pocket pages, and side pocket pages, right along with single recipe card pages This is a great scrapbook kit to get your creative juices flowing. You can actually fill this little book with a lot of recipe cards since it has the pockets and clip. That means you can fit several recipe cards into one pocket or under the clip allowing you to maximize your space. The photo above is one of my mom's cookie recipes that she shared with me many years ago. There is something that is very special to me seeing that recipe in my mom's own handwriting. See why hand journaling is so important?

Once an anti-Catholic, Peregrine converted when he struck a Christian across the face, and his victim calmly turned the other cheek and prayed for him. He lived in silence and solitude. When he did speak, he was known as an excellent preacher and gentle confessor. Late in life, he was healed of cancer after a vision of Christ.

What is ambiance? it's that combination of sensory elements that add up to atmosphere: the colour of a room's walls, the texture of upholstery fabric, the waft of air from a lazily turning ceiling fan, the aromas of exotic scents that perfume the air--it's the combination of what is often little things that turn a room into an experience. And it can be little things that make a room special, like a wonderful scent. Thomas just went old school and surprised me with a armfull of incense that was being clearanced at World Market. While I've never used incense, I do like heavy, Oriental scents, so I was actually excited to try it. Besides the idea of the perfumed smoke snaking through the air made me feel all BoHo chic.
It seems to me that many people are walking (or should I say running) around today in a state of tunnel vision, living life as others expect them to live it as opposed to living it the way they would choose if they had a choice. They get up in the morning, grab a very quick breakfast (if you could call it that), and head off to work. Many are probably eating their breakfast in the car so that they’re not wasting any time. They get to work and the routine starts, either rushing from meeting to meeting or heads down in their cubicle, trying to complete everything that they can in the day, often not finishing until into the evening. And it has to be this way because everybody else in the office is doing the same thing, and thus the expectations are set. Finally they’re able to head home, hopefully in time to sit down to dinner with the family. But then their mind starts up again and they’re already thinking about what they have to do in the morning or the next day. Even though they’re at home, they’re not really there because their mind is someplace else. Then the next day comes and it starts all over again.

The last few days have witnessed at least a dozen news reports on the launch of Ranbaxy’s new anti-malarial drug – Synriam. Several of the news reports such as the one over here and here give the impression that this drug launch is the first of its kind in India. The Business Line report in particular claims that Ranbaxy has spent invested $30 million to develop this drug. A part of this claim can be traced to Ranbaxy’s press-release which claims that Synriam is India’s ‘first new drug’. Image from here.

If you go fully traditional (and I don’t mean simply style, but in terms of reaching out primarily to the already convinced), you will reach a narrow segment of Believers. But if you go with a full Mars Hill approach – not merely polish and veneer, but all the way as the apostle Paul did in Acts 17 – you reach the largest segment of the already convinced as well. I’ve been watching this carefully, not just at Meck, but in churches around the world. The more you speak directly into the heart of culture, the more you reach both believer and explorer.

It’s also the most dialogue heavy of the three, since voiceover work means lines go by very quickly. The anime has the most character interaction of the different media, often leading to comic situations not explored in other formats. Since the dialogue is spoken, it’s potentially easier to follow or watch without giving it your complete attention, depending on your language preferences and fluency. The soundtrack is also wonderful, and the song inserts are very catchy.

I find myself inspired by the unexpected straight allies I found. I've grown up around a lot of religious-inspired homophobia, and there's still a lot in my family. But at work, observant Catholics, Muslims, and Jews told me they were praying for us, not to change, but to see the result we wanted. My NASCAR and Pittsburgh Penguins-fan friends online gave me encouragement. Sean Avery, the notorious pest on the New York Rangers, testified in favor of same-sex marriage in Albany, leading my wife and I to joke about the win coming with an assist by him. (I no longer hate Avery!) Our cell phones blew up with text and voice messages last night. Today, as we went about errands, straight people kept wanting to hug and congratulate us.

Good friends: If you are a homebrewer there's no question it should be a bottle or two of that beer you have been saving for a special occasion.

If they are not beer geeks, a mixed six pack of some of the best known a "craft Brewers" might turn them into beer geeks.

Have you any idea how embarrassing it is for me to tell people, let alone “my peers”, I’m unemployed?. . .Or having to write that shit down on an application about why I’m looking for another job?. . .Have you any idea, CoCo?” I swallowed my throat hard and choked back my reservations and shook my head.

Weather---as experienced on a daily basis and at any particular location--- is highly variable, but the challenge offered in the Hansen NYT piece is that the noise of such variations are now being drowned out by the global warming signal. Debating this latter point should not, of course, be confused with opening a debate about the rise in global mean temperatures. The IPCC (2007) has stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal. The unequivocal rise in global average temperature and the attribution that most of this rise is due to the rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, owes to the small natural variability of global mean temperatures compared to the large magnitude of the human-induced warming signal in global averaged temperatures. In other words, for global mean conditions, the signal is much louder than natural variability of globally averaged temperatures. The science is clear, we know that the planet has warming over the past century, and we are very confident as to why such warming has (and continues) to occur.

I'm working on my indecisive nature, but I'm having a hard time with it right now. As you may know, the decorating of my master bedroom/bathroom/closet is on my Spring Forward Project List. I decided on the color scheme and had a few ideas in mind on how I wanted to paint the walls in the bedroom. It involved a navy blue accent wall where the bed is, navy blue walls in the sitting area, and blue-grey for the rest of the walls. After some thought, I decided that I'm not feeling the accent wall thing. For some reason I just don't like accent walls as much as I used to. Now the problem is that I have to figure out what color I'm going to paint the walls. Navy blue all over or a lighter color. I'm so confused! I love the dramatic and bold look of a dark room, and it's just so sexy to me...
As the characters in Little Women illustrate the many perspectives of women’s search for identity and the discovery of the roles they chose, most women choose the traditional roles of marriage and motherhood. But as Jo took on the role of marriage to Mr. Bhaer, and motherhood in the form of her boy’s school in Little Men, she did not give up her own identity in the calling. She depicted the multiplexity of a woman’s role without denying the traditions associated with womanhood, or the new found strength and dignity of her own identity. Women, like Jo, could not deny a part of themselves to find another. She had to have the independence to discover every aspect of her being and to develop each component in her own way. Whether wife, mother, writer, teacher, or any other role in which many women find themselves, Alcott’s Little Women is a classic that showed the importance of womanhood’s many different roles, without denying any part of womanhood itself.

Which is where David Cameron comes in. Today the Telegraph reports that he "has ordered officials" to draw up plans for minimum pricing of alcohol, against the opposition of the Buisness Department (which worries that it might be illegual under EU regulations) and the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, who favours a voluntary approach. This is being presented as part of a personal moral crusade by the prime minister, who (the Telegraph ominously reports) "is thought to have opted for a big bang approach to the alcohol problem after noting the success of the ban on smoking in public places."

If you look back at some of the rumours and whispers we put out - there's one that hints at a wyrm-ruled isle somewhere west of the Amedio. It was a nod towards the old Beyond the Flanaess map with the various, um, "interestingly" named realms. I was picturing a militaristic kingdom the middle of the Sea of the Dragon King (which would not be called Nippon) with a culture that referenced a mix of south and south-east Asian cultures - so more kalaripayattu than kenjitsu. That would have been fun to write up.

We also have a wonderful working model of what would eventually be the Grand Ballroom scene; however, it's not clear when Yale built this model. It could come from the post-Fair years, when Davis-Coats-Atencio were running the show. So in the end, it's hard to tell just what the Mansion would have looked like inside if Rolly and Yale had had their way and it had opened in 1963, as originally planned when they took charge. What kind of show would you have seen, step by step? We know it would have been a walk-thru. In fact, the reason there are two stretching rooms is that in the Crump-Gracey years they were planning two complete walk-thru attractions, exact duplicates, side by side, in order to handle the crowds. Between the sea captain character and the guided walk-thru format, it also sounds like they were planning to continue using Ken Anderson's basic template. Beyond that, it's sketchy. This 1962 brochure, announcing a 1963 opening, isn't much help.

According to NYTimes.com, for Manchester City, there was no added pressure at all. Responding to a Ferguson statement where he called the match “the derby of all derby games,” Mancini didn’t bend to his manipulation and said, “We don’t have pressure; we don’t have anything to lose.” Mancini was merely taking it all in stride, while Ferguson was stressing the importance of the game, which could have easily increased the players’ anxiety. Truthfully, the game was a must-win situation for both teams because it may be the deciding factor to a title, but Mancini didn’t want to add any unneeded pressure. The pressures of their own crowd and the media hype would be enough and the players didn’t need anymore from their coach. This tactic seemed to pay off and even after The Manchester Evening News told both sets of players that they will be “legends or losers,” Man City had the upper hand for nearly the entire game. Maybe it was because of their home crowd (and the fact that they are 17-0-1 at home) or maybe it was because Mancini didn’t let the outlying pressures get to him or his players, but Manchester City outplayed Manchester United and after “the most seismic local tear-up in the history of English football,” they are in place to win their first Premier League championship since 1968.

The last race of the year for me (till November, stay tuned) was a 3-day stage race in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. It is an interesting event, in that the entire thing takes place in a very urban area. The team did great this year, but the highlight for me was the wonderful people we stayed with. They opened their home to the team (second year in a row) and do so during their wedding anniversary... In a way, typical of the gererosity I’ve seen from the places where we stayed in “host-housing” this year. But also, very unique. Jeff and Betsy hosted us two years in a row and better than feeling at home, they made me feel like an honored guest.

After performing press-ups, eating grizzly snacks and asking random old men to kiss him on the forehead, Elliot finally won entry to see his bride-to-be and the formalities of tea and soup drinking began.

But I’m obviously missing something important. Though I buy calendars and make notes, it never seems to culminate in me being organised. It’s just more pieces of paper for me to lose in the pile of things-that-are-very-probably-important.

Last week I sounded the "HELP" alarm and asked you guys to chime in on where I should put a playroom in our house. I shared the full floor plan for the first and second floors and gave you 2 options - the current formal living room and the large bonus room upstairs. You were all amazing (of course) and so willing to help!
I stumbled across one of the more unique and amazing blogs I have seen recently. Which is saying a lot with all the wonderful blogs out there. The blog I discovered is called Knock-Off Wood. The blogger, Ana, shows how to make gorgeous furniture that is a knock-off of pricey pieces from places such as Pottery Barn and Restoration Hardware.
Current work: back to the med (awaiting verdict on second revs)
I know my script is good, but there’s still that little voice in the back of my head saying “But is it good enough?” There are literally thousands, probably even tens of thousands of people just like me trying to accomplish the exact same thing. It’s me against them. Every man for himself.
Third, any marriage of religious doctrine, left or right, to current political disputes should give pause. It is perfectly appropriate for people of faith — or even cynical admirers of the political possibilities of faith — to ask, “what would Jesus do?” in the grip of a personal moral choice. It is not appropriate to ask “how would Jesus vote?” on the stimulus package, bank bail-outs, auto industry bailouts and labor union windfalls, deficit reduction measures, and tax policy.

One lady burnt, one lady stoned,
Richard Gardner, formerly a psychoanalyst and child psychiatrist on the clinical faculty at Columbia University, introduced the term parental alienation syndrome in his 1985 debut article on the subject….he openly supported abolishing child abuse reporting laws and controversially declared that sexual abuse cases are “turn-ons” for those involved in the court process, including lawyers and judges. Despite these unusual claims, Gardner was highly sought as an expert witness, testifying in over 400 child custody cases before the end of his career….

Well. I don't know what happened but my blog has been poorly for a few days. I had one of those " malware" warnings flashing up and no-one including me could get into my blog. My mate who sorts peoples computers out for a living said Google would spot it and sort it out and not to worry about it. The good news is that he was right and according to Webmaster tools I'm clean as a whistle. The not so good news is that i didn't give a monkeys if my blog never came back.I felt relieved at not having to update it, not that I "have to" anyway but I feel I should. It's not the writing of the posts as much as the photo editing and trying to get a decent pic in bad light etc. I think I really started to get fed up of it when I started entering challenges as I find it such a pain finding suitable ones and linking up and so forth. It turned my hobby into a job and I've already got one of those. So I've decided not to enter any more for the time being and see if that helps me. I don't want to stop blogging. I'd get fat for a start, if I didn't do my friday weigh ins, lol. Anyway, I hope i'ts just a temporary feeling and that it will go away soon.
In Plain Sight - I didn't get into this show until well into it's third season and just watched the series finale this weekend. I love this little watched gem which only got better over time. It plays like a Witness Protection procedural but it's also jammed full of quirky, damaged characters who surprised me with their humanity each episode. To call Mary McCormack's Mary Shannon, 'difficult' is an incorrect use of the word. It's not strong enough. Marshall Shannon is as 'alpha male' as a female can get. Pairing such a sarcastic character with a meterosexual partner ( Frederic Weller as Marshall Mann) was often the source of great comic storytelling. I like that in all the interviews I have seen with McCormack that she varies little from the character she plays on TV.

Stamps: Magnolia and Stampin' Up
For the last two days, the foreign mercenary has become a bogeyman in Bamako. It was late Monday night that Captain Amadou Sanogo, leader of Mali’s CNRDRE military junta, blamed the unrest that had started several hours earlier on foreign mercenaries who had infiltrated the city in the service of ill-intentioned, unidentified Malians. The junta’s statement on ORTM television Tuesday morning repeated these allegations, adding that some foreigners had been captured alongside the Malian paratroopers who had attacked junta strongholds Monday evening.
I usually get many questions about my last name. When people see the name Porturas, and look at me, they never imagine that I’ve got Native American blood. But I do, I’m a white Inca Indian and my father is from the Andes Mountains. When people think about the Andes they usually think that people there live in small huts and are chocolate brown. And when they see me, a blue/green-eyed girl with light brown hair they think it’s impossible that I hail from there. And I have to explain what a mestizo is. “Mestizo is a term traditionally used in Latin America and Spain for people of mixed heritage or descent. In some countries it has come to mean a mixture of European and Amerindian” – Wikipedia

I had to park creatively, off to the side near the kerosene pump, because the construction was taking up so much room in the parking lot. Inching past a guy teetering precariously above the automatic door, which was in a constantly rotating cycle of open and close and open and close, I managed to get inside the store. The lunch-time crush was in full swing. I maneuvered back to the iced drink dispensers while my son checked out refrigerated cases full of canned sodas. We agreed to meet back at the candy aisle before reconnoitering how to approach the growing line of people waiting to pay for their purchases.

Absolut Kurant - 40%
A recent article in the London Guardian dealt with the drop in tourists to Egypt, which depends on them. Since Mubarak stepped down – and liberation rallies continued – Egypt has seen tourism plummet. The extent of the fall depends on who you read, but may be up to 50% what it was in 2010. Fewer tourists visit Cairo than other sites (no surprise, since protests tend to take place in the city), but even the Sphinx is now largely unseen.
Just before I moved to Lincoln last year, I had several lessons with a dressage trainer who got Echo much more 'up' in front and sitting on her hind legs. I wonder whether this was too sudden a change - I was asking quite a lot more of her quite quickly. Perhaps that caused the suspensory problems...I don't know. I'm not sure what I think of what he said, because if I believe that entirely, it suggests that Echo will never be able to do dressage again, which would be sad. It's an interesting idea that some horses are more able mentally and in temperament, than they are physically to cope with the demands of what we ask them to do.

I recently tried to talk sense into a very dear friend of mine, regarding his love life. Did he listen? No… of course he didn’t; he’s in love. If you want logic with your love, better stick to phallic machinery. Love is not rational. If you can be talked out of it, trust me, you didn’t have it in the first place. Heartbreak is part of the game. To paraphrase a certain science-fiction character: “If you can’t handle a little bloody nose then maybe you ought to go back home and crawl under your bed… by yourself! It’s not safe out there! It’s wondrous; with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross… but it’s not for the timid!” We’d all like to be more sensible about those we love, but when was the last time you listened to reason when you felt that way?

Today while on a trip to Saffron Walden to look at some Brewlab brewing kit we went to Indian Summer Brewery. A new 10 BBL plant in a prefabricated wooden shed, inside a large warehouse belonging to a Timber Merchant. A very strange set up indeed and not the place I expected to find someone brewing beer with the sole intention to sell to Indian Restaurants. However the sparge was on when we arrived, and 8 barrels of pale wort was being transferred into the kettle by brewer Jules and consultant Mike Hitchen from Brewlab.
I was describing at Knit Knite last Wedndesday how one year, in my youth, I realized that nothing changed at midnight 12/31 and so do not wait up for this artificial shift anymore. As a child, I often stayed with my cousins on Long Island that day. Aunt Flora sent us out with kitchen utensils and pots banging the New Year in which I found a lot of fun. I loved staying with them as they had a dog, Midnight, I could feed and love while there.
It’s just been one of those weeks and I am just happy to put it behind me.

Lila is 17 and has this special ability – which btw, aside from being mentioned on the first page only shows up again at around p. 100 of the novel … talk about sloooow – in that she can move things with her mind. For all intents and purposes this is a pretty damn cool power to have, yet so under-used by Lilah and Sarah Alderson in favor of cheap romance. Anyway, the first 100 pages basically focus on Lila page after page declaring how much she’s been in love with Alex, her brother’s best friend, her entire life, and how swoon-worthy that blue-eyed boy really is, and how much she really wants him to pick her up and do whatever with her. The whole damsel-in-distress pining for the blue-eyed boy is not only way too stereotypical, it’s downright offensive if you want to make a credible heroine who can do things on her own and with her own mind! Because seriously, all Lila seems to want is making sure she gets The Alex.

After seeing Drive (2011) and Valhalla Rising (2009), directed by Nicolas Winding Refn I was expecting the same kind of smooth beauty in the direction. That didn’t really happen in this one. There’s gritty as a genre and there’s gritty in the filming and this is the latter. It’s the former as well come to think of it, but that’s to be expected. This was far weaker in film quality. I’m sure that’s meant to convey a message, but it conflicts with his own direction style which is to convey more with film than dialogue.

I did yell at the dog at one point and I emailed my husband begging him to come home early so that I can take a long nap. I just really want to speed up the process of him learning how to self-soothe. I desperately need to start getting 5-6 hours of sleep in a row again. A couple of job leads look promising and I simply don't see how I could work given the type of sleep I am getting. I went for a second interview yesterday that involved a 2-hour strategy exercise and I was utterly exhausted when I got home. And then slept in 1-hour increments through the night.

Yes, I do love Sundays. I went to church and had a great time! Not the same kind of a "great time" as jumping on trampolines or anything like that. But better! Because it's church! I skyped my family once again! They're really cool people. I was talking with my little brother, Jesse, when we realized that we have the coolest parents of all time. How did we get so lucky? We must have done something pretty darn spectacular in the pre-existence to deserve them. Once we were finished talking about their possession of awesomeness, I told Jesse to let me talk to them again. He informed me that they feel asleep on the bed by the computer.
So how has the class warfare argument shifted from the rich against the poor to the poor against the rich? The rich control information. The rich control all media, and therefore are able to manipulate opinion. So as soon as the president or the middle class start having a discussion about rich people simply paying their fair share, you hear the wealthy (by political proxy) complain that the president and the middle class are engaging in tax warfare. The argument the wealthy make is that they're the "job creators", which has shown during this downturn to be complete bullshit, because they've essentially horded their money during these lean times. I'm not a class warrior, and I do agree that in good times people with money are more capable of creating companies (and by default, jobs) than those with no money, but I think this line of thinking fails to recognize two things: the first is that the wealthy are not creating companies to create jobs, they're creating them to make money (which I won't make a value judgment about here, it's just a fact), and second, just because people in the middle and lower classes don't create jobs, it doesn't make them less valuable as citizens (although politicians would have you believe this).

The obvious problem is, of course, that such an imposition seems to violate the liberty of the students. Since they are adults, there is a presumption in favor of their right to dress as they choose. Naturally, this should match the laws regarding public indecency (although those could be challenged as well). However, provided the students are not violating such laws, it would seem reasonable to not impose on their liberty. Unless, of course, the harm done by specific attire would morally warrant imposing on the liberty of the students. This takes me to the second reason.

The Spanish knew Eriodictyon crassifolium as yerba santa because the Franciscans recognized its medicinal value. But it has also become known, over the years, by a variety of common names including mountain balm, bishop wort, purple betony, holy herb, bear plant, saint's herb and most intriguingly, Indian chewing gum. A company called Blue Coyote Organics sells the dried herb at ten bucks an ounce and recommends smoking it or making a tea infusion "to calm the soul". The chewed leaves are resinous and bitter. Local Chumash knew it as wishap'.

The high school was still the same, a massive building surrounded by hilly, green, lush lawns in the front and a track in the back. This is where I met my husband. I was sixteen at the time and he seventeen. I took my daughter through my memory lane pointing to the side door where her father used to exit waiting for me to pass by so he could say hello; something that made this shy girl a bit uncomfortable. I knew him to be gregarious and a guy all the girls seemed to love. I knew this and so had no interest. I was never going to be one of the girls he always seemed to be surrounded by, confident girls whose social graces exceeded mine, girls who conversed easily, appeared comfortable in their own skins, and seemed more interesting, prettier. It didn't matter that my heart fluttered each time I saw him, as far as I was concerned, he was someone who would never be interested in me. I don't know if my shyness or my indifference were the contributing factors, but the more he failed to connect with me, the more he became interested and pursued. We were a challenge to each other for different reasons.
This is the 75th Hunger Games, a special kind of Games every 25 years that is always equipped with new terror – previous changes being double the tributes and for the first Quell, tributes voted on by people of their own districts.

Peeta volunteers to go as well, because he wants to protect Katniss, and we’re thrown back into the arena that made us fall in love with the series in the first place.

Let’s be clear, guys. Some women don’t wear make-up, yes, but most women know how to wear make-up that makes it look like they don’t have it on and they just happen to have the most even skin in the world ALL. THE. TIME.

Oil Facts:
(Moses) stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “If you’re on the LORD’s side, come over here to me!” Then all the Levites gathered around him. He said to them, “This is what the LORD God of Israel says: Each of you put on your sword. Go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other, and kill your relatives, friends, and neighbors.” The Levites did what Moses told them, and that day about 3,000 people died. Moses said, “Today you are ordained as the LORD’s priests. God gave you a blessing today because each of you fought with your own sons and brothers.” Exodus 32:26-29
For an example of why to remove disqualifications, simply think of Jon Jones vs. Matt Hamill or Anderson Silva vs. Yushin Okami. I don’t think disqualifications are a good indicator of who the better fighter was.
They, as one, thought this report of Paul to be foolishness. Their minds were made up, especially after Paul referred to Jesus of Nazareth, proving Him to be the Lord. Paul was trying to make his fellow Jews see the person of Jesus Christ but He continued to be a stumbling block to them. He could have presented scores of references such as Ananias, yes, even the Lord Himself, and they still would not believe.
Oh, don't get me wrong. There will still be another Monochromatic Meal of the Month and I'm all aboard for it (the color orange won't know what hit 'em). And of course, Up In Arms, tonight at 8 pm at Macalester (Kagin), which will draw a big crowd but I will still be doing last-minute recruiting for it today. And when Bao and Juliana's little one comes through, I'll be cooking up a storm to save them some meal-making stress. And if anyone ever wants to arrange a happy hour or maybe a soul food night out at Brasa or what have you, you know I won't resist.
That figure of course, pales in comparison with the RM 12.5 billion PKFZ scandal in which the central figure is none other than former MCA president Ling Liong Sik.

That's not to say that I could comfortably walk in them, or that I could sit down in them without the deflated balloon Mama Belly draping itself over the waistband. But I could stand up in them, provided I didn't move too much, which was a good start.
One of my students wrote a story with a woman arriving in a remote airport who finds she has no rental car. She's stuck. That's the crux of the first scene. I advised the author to layer in a hook and a heart and see how that transforms the character and her plight enough to propel a whole story. Otherwise, the scene's just a cranky woman stuck in an airport. Not a story builder.
Again. My name. I hear it now with aching clarity. I chance a glimpse back, just as I force my march into a trot. The street is a valley of stone, with nothing animated but the white wings of abandoned newspapers, tumbleweeds blown on a prairie of asphalt. No car even sleeps by the curb. No window is alive, behind me, in front. Darkness has engulfed everything beyond the meagre streetlights. Is there a power outage?
Entertainers today are a far cry from the ones I recall as a kid. I remember one magician – who was hired by everyone for lack of other options – who faithfully performed the same tricks and recited the same lines, over and over. That formula definitely won’t work today.

Besides standing my ground and knowing well enough, I've started praying that God helps me get over Jermaine. I really get this feeling that I just need the extra oomph to get past this spot. I know so much and have so much awareness; it just feels like something keeps getting tangled up on the inside, so I've decided to ask for help.

Meanwhile, since the demise of Dominic Strauss-Kahn, Tim Geithner has probably said more things about and to the EU than he did in the previous three years in total: on banking regulation, on derivatives control, and on “avoiding the UK’s light-touch regulatory regime which ended so tragically”.
“So he just happened to be a principal. Do you know why he started using students?”
Politicians who came after them, and who cared nothing for their sacrifice and to whom such concepts as love, honour and patriotism are beyond their understanding, have betrayed their memory and maybe even rendered their sacrifice meaningless.

Professor Jacobson over at Legal Insurrection has posted a video recorded during the 2008 primaries in which former Arkansas Governor and 2008 Republican presidential primary candidate Mike Huckabee claims quite blatantly that Mitt Romney is a liar. It was quite a famous ad in its time. Huckabee didn't have the money to run the ad on Iowa television ahead of the Iowa caucuses, so campaign manager Ed Rollins hit on a brilliant strategy. He called a press conference, where he showed the ad. The media televised it as part of their news cycle, at no expense to the Huckabee campaign. In fact, the ad has been credited in no small measure with helping Huckabee win the Iowa caucuses in what was a stunning upset to the Romney campaign. In fact, even though Huckabee did not go on to become that year's GOP nominee, it might well have helped John McCain in the end. Here is the ad, which quite clearly targets Romney as a liar, and a purveyor of liberal ideas, including co-pays for abortion, and gun control. And of course, RomneyCare.
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The decline in AFR seems to have been real, and not an artefact of incomplete marriage and birth records. In fact, the church registers provide exceptionally detailed birth and marriage data. Nor was it an artefact of an influx of people with lower AFRs. Almost everyone on Île aux Coudres is descended from thirty families who settled the island between 1720 and 1773.

Not everyone agreed, especially not my mom. She gave me an ultimatum, back to school or get a job, which never came into effect. I faced a lot of resistance from older family members and friends’ parents. It was hectic in my relationships afterwards, which is understandable; it was incredibly abnormal. I was 13 years old and no one could persuade, threaten, or bribe to go back to school. I had a strong will and was choosing for myself what kind of life I wanted to live. In retrospect, I probably would have approached people differently.

A few weeks later, after adjusting to my new religion and wearing hijab off and on, I took my Shahada on November 9, 2001. I went against the orthodox Christian teachings that my father (a preacher) and mother had instilled in me and found something that spoke to my soul.
I loved the book so much I was pretty reluctant to see the movie – let’s face it, brilliant books are so rarely made into good (or excellent) movies! But, I did add it to my rental list on lovefilm when it was playing in the cinema. I couldn’t quite make myself spend the money to go see it – what if it was awful & they ruined the book? I couldn’t risk it – not with a book I loved so much.

Okay then; a funny Dracula movie with pretty nude girls for him to ogle and nibble. That could work. Kelley makes a humorous acting, over the top Drac/Aluc and his vocal assist is actually pretty funny to listen to. And as Mike/Irving goes, Whitton is a bland but serviceable Renfield-esque sideman with hairy assist. At face value we have what could best be described as a lower-than-low rent Dracula flick from Turkey (hey, most of the action's set in a cave!).
Having said that, there are many good resources available to aid us in our prayer life. In addition to Scripture, I have made much use of books of prayers, devotional works, prayer lists, pictures of loved ones, maps of persecuted Christians, etc. All of these and more have, I truly believe, enhanced my prayer life and made it a much richer and fruitful experience for me. They have helped to draw me closer to God. I’m indebted to the faithful saints who produce such resources for the rest of us.
Setting off to wander the port, the evening was warm and sunny and it was time for a cocktail! We grabbed a table on the sidewalk at Om Cafe which had both gin fizzes and whiskey sours on their cocktail menu. This would not be our only time ordering refreshing and well made gin fizzes from Om.
Here are some things I saw in that last week(ish)! Includes an Indonesian tall ship from NOLA Navy Week, a civil war reenactment at Fort Jackson, and lots of bars. In review, it seems I may spend too much time at bars.
As mentioned in my initial post, I started seriously and more or less systematically thinking on how to live a happy, financially independent and free life quite a long time ago.
FREE SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION BY TIM HOLTZ
Hello friends! I hope you are enjoying this Christmas season and finding time to reflect on HIS indescribable gift! I'm popping in to share a window card I made using several of this month's new releases from Our Daily Bread designs. I used the Stitched Background for my front, and cut out my window with the Our Daily Bread designs custom Elegant Oval Die, made by Spellbinders for ODBD. I also used the Honeycomb Background for the inside, embossing it with clear embossing powder and then using a resist technique, I sponged on T Holtz distress ink in Scattered Straw. I used the Daisy/Black Eyed Susan set, stamping three times and cutting out elements I wanted to use and coloring with Copics. I used a sentiment from Little Things for my inside sentiment and cut it with Spellbinders Label One, then matted with SB Ornate Artisan Tags & Accents. The little gingham ribbon was in my stash, and I added the bees from Simple Things, making the stitched background look like their trails.

Yep that’s what I said. Subplot makes it more real, mimicking real life. You see, even when a plot, or should I say a story or issue, dominates our lives, i.e. the sudden death of a loved one that overwhelms us, we still have to deal with the phone ringing and the boiler’s broken down, we’ve run out of loo paper … oh and now your neighbour’s kid is always in your house, watching your TV because she’s always fighting with her mum. While the real plot might well focus on the death and perhaps this is a cheery story (!) of how a woman comes to terms with her sudden loss and reinvents herself, a liberation from her drunken wife-beating husband (who knows!) the focus of the main plot is his death and her journey. BUT if this is the only storyline it won’t feel real. Even if she obsesses and has a breakdown, whatever her internal conflict, it will feel a whole lot more real if you add colour; add little subplots that tell their own story. BUT, and this is important (pay attention … bossy aren’t I?) at the same time subplots must augment the main plot. So in essence the subplot still drives the main story, by feeding into it.
This next book is one of those that grabbed my attention and immediately got me thinking of childish games and hidden faces...
This was their first project – and I suppose there are many more to come!

The real selling point of this flick is that it’s written by Tarantino himself, and as everybody already knows, this guy is a freakin’ original genius. Tarantino is able to take any situation and make it go from normal to completley insane in about a matter of 5 seconds and it will give you this bad-ass feeling that you could not expect. The story is a pretty familiar but there are people getting killed at every second that you wouldn’t expect, twists and turns, random pop-culture references that somehow fit into the story, and just a whole bunch of other cool moments in this flick that make it ten times more the awesome thrill ride that it is known as today.
Since we are not total beginners, we found the rule a little ridiculous. But the Japanese didn't become successful because they are given to one's whims and fancies so they would tell you that their's a tried and tested industrial learning process, not to be tampered with by a few bored housewives.

No shipping means no delivery of coal and oil and no shipping of food and other necessities.Yes, extreme weather, such as snow, ice, and sand storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, torrential rains and floods, can all play havoc with the orderly distribution of goods. Sadly, the predictions by climate scientists that anthropogenic global climate change will result in extreme weather becoming increasingly common were clearly off base, because it's happening a lot quicker than they expected. I'm going to go disable my catalytic converter just to display my contempt for their imprecise computer modeling skills.
We also made plans to spend a few weeks in Hawaii come the end of October. A lady in the park has for years, rented a 3 bedroom home on Oahu, and rents out several of the bedrooms, that makes it affordable for everyone. She had one opening left, and we took a few seconds to make up our minds, we were going! Seeing how we are only planning on staying close to “home” this summer, this would make up for it some. Still plan on traveling slowly up the coast July and August, but not going further than our home town in northern California, of many years. Not sure what our grandsons Little League schedule is like and he has become quite the little bowler, and will be competing in the state tournament in southern California some time in July. Hope on working something out that he can spend some time traveling with us. But once they reach their teen age years, they do get busy with their own lives. Miss him bunches, but the memories that we have of all the time that we did get to spend together are priceless.
Geoff Dickens, thanking Andy for his interesting speech, remarked that the older ones amongst us would not be around when the 'wonderful multiculturalism' happens, so it is good that young ones care.

It was only a 40 minute talk but packed with fascinating facts, for example did you know the barnacle has the largest (relative to body size) penis of all creatures? It was a risky starting fact, but loosened up the (mainly male) audience.
But a movie like X: The Man With X-Ray Eyes succeeds or fails on the strength and believability of its performers. Suffice it to say that Milland, a class act from the aforementioned Lost Weekend, Dial M For Murder, Premature Burial, Panic In The Year Zero and later successes in Love Story, The Thing With Two Heads, Frogs and Escape To Witch Mountain, Milland lends an earnest demeanor, solemn face and profound furrowed brow to the role of Xavier and reminds us all that, while it may be initially fun to see through women's clothes and through building walls, there are consequences to everything. And the anguish he suffers through his experiments and (say it with me) tampering in God's domain force him to pay an awful price.
Thinking about it (as God knows I do! lol!)

These came under the control of the Kuomintang, the Nationalist Government in China from whom the Gold had been received. Many were left in China when the Kuomintang had to flee to Taiwan. The Gold had been nationalized by the Kuomintang who moved much of the FRN’s (but not all) to Taiwan which was built on these notes. These Notes were the underlying wealth of Taiwan and they were good for value as they were backed by gold.

I’m not suggesting that authors stack reviews. Family and best friend reviews are usually easy to spot. If anything, they give savvy buyers a negative impression.
