"Those guys are going to get chances because they're good," Olczyk said. "But if you have a shutdown line, you're going to try to limit these guys. Then you have to pick your spots on where you want to go from there. It would have to be a strong matchup approach against them at home or on the road. The way that they play, and the type of players they have, to me that would be one way you'd try to exploit them. But they're pretty deep and as long as they continue to get that consistent 'stop and go,' like they have all year, I think the sky is the limit for them."

The European debt crisis. Our continuing jobs gloom. Oh, and let's not forget the rocketing national debt that is financing the entire stock-market boom. In past months I've been watching with amazement as Wall Street—and a lot of investors—have been trying to sweep these under the carpet. But they won't stay there. On Thursday, markets were spooked when Moody's downgraded Spain's government debt. But why is anyone surprised? Had investors been paying attention, they would have known that the market for default risk was already sending serious warning signals about Spain and Portugal's credit -- not to mention that of Greece.

Best value pick: Tommy Streeter. When I did my full Ravens mock draft last week, I really wanted to project this speedy Miami wideout to the Ravens in the later rounds, but many analysts had him being drafted in the fourth or fifth round. Yet there Streeter was late in the sixth round when the Ravens, who had missed out on other receivers earlier in the draft, finally took him off the board. Streeter is nearly 6-foot-5, and he ran one of the fastest 40-yard dash times at the NFL scouting combine. He is not very polished, but if the coaching staff can refine his skills, he might become a late-round steal.

There was no information on how this affects the timetable for Suggs’ return. But this we do know: the Ravens, while seemingly not ready to rule Suggs out for the 2012 campaign, expect that the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year will miss a good chunk of the season. The best-case scenario appears to be a November return, but history in most cases also suggests that it’s a 10-to-12 month injury. The bottom line is that anything the Ravens can get from Suggs in the upcoming season will be a huge bonus.

There is no such thing as a best seat in the house. You sit where you think you'll see and hear well - at the right price.

For dance, in PlayhouseSquare or wherever, make sure you don't sit too close, where it's possible that the dancers will appear to have no feet. What's the point (pointe?) of attending a dance performance if one of the prime aspects of the art doesn't seem to exist? Halfway back on the main floor or near the front of the mezzanine should do the trick. -- Donald Rosenberg, Plain Dealer Music and Dance Critic

In Florence’s subsequent lawsuit, he and his lawyer chose not to bring state law claims as part of the federal civil-rights lawsuit that he filed in 2005.

Natalie O'Keefe has provided a much-needed boost for the Granite City girls basketball team.
I have religious beliefs that say we are to love God and our fellow man as ourselves. That seems to be universally accepted. However, The Bible also states in Corinthians 14:34, that "women shall not speak in church." I do not believe that it is God's will that women not teach and speak in His church. Many verses in the Bible must be looked at with an understanding that some verses have been translated through the centuries in an incorrect way. For those who want to deny gay people the right to marry based on religious beliefs that come from Bible verses, they should reconsider based on the above mentioned verse that is one example of verses in question. Also, heterosexual marriage is not based on the notion that married couples must have children, so this argument is false.
"I've been on the other side myself," she said. "I see the students coming into the room with their hopes, and I want to go up and hug them. That's my instinct. I am an extremely sensitive person.

Of course, things could get even worse in November should the budgetary changes - i.e., tax increases - on the November ballot not pass muster with voters, as Brown reminded his audience. "Suck it up," he urged the business leaders, many of whom will likely qualify for the "millionaires tax."
While the waiter was quick to point out several new items, which we appreciated, the staff wasn't as adept at checking back or delivering the food. They unnecessarily reached across diners, plopped the food down in such a rush that what was once arranged on one side of the plate ended up near the middle. Clearly, the waiters know the drill, but they're like athletes who lose their edge from complacency and need to get disciplined again.

He's one of at least seven candidates in the June 5 race, along with prosecutors Bobby Grace, Steve Ipsen, Alan Jackson, Jackie Lacey, Danette Meyers and Mario Trujillo, and this page will be sounding out all of them for their positions — and pledges, if they are moved to make them — on issues such as the "three strikes" law, alternative sentencing, public safety realignment, drug treatment and the death penalty. Trutanich's two broken promises don't automatically disqualify him in our eyes, but they don't help. He's dug himself into a hole, and we're not going to let him pretend that he hasn't.
As much as Anderson’s reputation has been helped by the hiring of men’s basketball coach Mark Turgeon, his legacy at Maryland will ultimately be tied to Edsall. The decision to cut eight teams had little to do with Anderson; the fate of those sports and the athletes who play them was sealed before Anderson arrived from Army in October 2010 to replace Debbie Yow.

Cinco de Mayo is all about legend, and so are margaritas. The origins of margaritas vary from one tequila to the next, but I really like the story of Margarita Sames. To cut the heat of a hot Acapulco afternoon, Margarita swirled together tequila, lime juice and Cointreau (cointreau.com), a premium full-bodied orange liqueur. Supposedly her guests liked the concoction so much that her party kept going for two weeks afterward. The drink was named after her, and for those of us who enjoy margaritas, mucho gracias, Margarita!

Another case that didn't go as well as it should have was the one concerning the Army's abuses at Abu Ghraib. Senior officers were punished administratively rather than court-martialed. When an officer, Army Lt. Col. Steven Jordan, was finally tried, he was acquitted of criminal responsibility for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. But regardless of his guilt or innocence, his prosecution was inexperienced and poorly done.

Purépecha Indian territory, stretching from the gorgeous highland capital of Morélia to a long, unspoiled coast, is best known for its tamales called corundas. Instead of being wrapped around fillings, the masa itself is made with the traditional doblecrema (a creamy, salty cheese), and roasted poblano pepper strips; a variety of other ingredients may be mixed in. Most of the spice comes from the simple green sauce of tomatillos and hot chile peron. They are wrapped in fresh corn leaves rather than dried husks, which imparts a slightly smoky flavor. The best come from the Purépecha peasants who travel daily from outlying villages to stock the food markets and sell handmade crafts in the streets of Pátzcuaro, famous for its Day of the Dead celebration. Pátzcuaro is also known for the small, sweet corn tamale called uchepo de leche, made of finely ground corn mixed with milk and cooked with sugar and cinnamon. From Río Balsas, at the Guerrero state border, come corundas cooked in banana leaves with wild cherries and raw sugar.
