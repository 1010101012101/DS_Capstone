"There's just no way around it. You don't need to think about how exhausting this is. You've just got to keep in your mind that it's getting closer to playoff time and we need to be ready for that time regardless of the fatigue, the amount of games that we've already played."

Encouraging too is the recent scaled success of films such as "Melancholia" and the Wall Street drama "Margin Call" in using a hybrid release strategy that pairs theatrical runs with video-on-demand accessibility. It's a development that could signal the end of one-size-fits-all releasing (a rallying cry on the festival circuit for some time), because each film can find its own best way to connect with audiences.
"It's a serious book. I know younger people who have read the books and they don't seem to get the point of the story.
Rulon, on the other hand, doesn't seem to like Arthur (so say the other contestants, anyway, as they sit around the "Biggest Loser" house speculating). Irene, who has ended up on Bob Harper's Team Blue, says she would definitely bring Arthur back. Jillian tells Hannah and Rulon that Arthur would have trouble with the challenges, but she could get lots of weight off of him. Whereas if they bring Rulon's idea -- Jen's dad, Jay -- back, Jillian says Jay could win the whole show. Which isn't good for Hannah or Rulon.
NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN: Creative Cause quieted the Kentucky Derby rumor mill with a routine gallop Thursday. Something must be wrong, the backstretch buzz suggested, when the Santa Anita Derby runner-up did not leave the barn for two days following his workout Monday. Turns out trainer Mike Harrington, a former veterinarian, simply was following the pattern he has employed since opening his stable in 1993. Harrington's horses walk for two days following a workout.

C.B.'s spiritual and sexual journey forms the spine of the show and Linebarger gives us a deeply felt, emotionally honest portrait of a kid who's figuring out how he feels and why.

What becomes a legend most? Loads of oil and grease. This Italian hot dog legend has been serving dogs since 1958. Colorful if not chaotic atmosphere; it’s a great place to take the neighborhood’s temperature. It’s called Dickie Dee’s Pizza, but they’re best known for hot dogs, even if the sausage sandwich is the best thing there. Confused yet?
Recently defeated candidates Alex Sink and Charlie Crist teamed with this environmental group last week to push for a constitutional amendment to ban drilling and exploration within 10 miles of the coastline. And they're right that the law can be changed. In fact, the Florida House tried to overturn that law in 2009 … though the zeal to drill dried up after BP's big spill. Also, there's precedent in this state for Floridians using the constitution to ban things that are already banned. (See gay marriage.)

Because Israel has not signed the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it was not present at Tuesday's gathering of treaty members.

Whenever I do my own home improvement projects, I feel as if I'm under her watchful eye, trying to meet her standards, which, being mortal, I never do. When I take a domestic shortcut and glue-gun a drape, or skip out on painting inside a closet, or use fake florals in a centerpiece, or cook with canned rather than home-brewed chicken stock, I imagine Stewart shaking her head. I hear her tsk, tsk.

A: It focuses on female empowerment, letting these girls know there are brighter futures ahead for them. We know that a lot of them come from backgrounds where they've faced disappointment in the past. Sometimes they don't have these experiences available to them; this is something they can do, they can work with an older mentor who can share their life experience with them, experience an activity - something they might not have been able to do on their own.
Several groups are working to topple those lazy, sexist views. One of the least likely may be Chicks for Beer, led by Ingrid Qua, a recent craft convert.

The characters in Chinese for Hakka mean guest people. The Hakka had lost their homeland north of the Yellow River in the third century A.D. to invading nomads. They eked out a living, farming the poorest soil, or were ultimately driven in desperation to the sea to found colonies in Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Borneo and Southeast Asia. So the story about a branch of landless Hakka people  to which my mother belongs by an extenuated 1,400 years of history  came to the United States in 1851. Could other Chinese have come before the California Gold Rush by this direct route?

The measure reflects a compromise suggested by County Councilman Mike O'Mara, D-Florissant, between sprinkler organizations that promote the idea and homebuilders who oppose it.

For, despite the upbeat music, this is a dark tale where the artists themselves destroy their dreams.

Even with these creative detours, there's no denying the strong French vibe provided by owners Jocelyn Bulow and Marc-Henri Sempere. Their experience in the food business also informs the service.

So in the back half of the season, the Buckeyes actually need to run more than they did in the first half. The Illinois game, which saw the Buckeyes gain 211 yards on 51 carries, was actually the right idea.

BGE workers, many of them hired from out of state, who were sent to repair lines and do cleanup are not the ones to blame. They are working people doing their best. The problem is the executives who pocket millions in compensation each year yet still want to pass along the $90 million bill for post-Irene cleanup to BGE customers already burdened with some of the highest utility bills in the country. There is also nothing good about BGE/Constellation execs hiring out of town workers when 25 percent of Baltimoreans live in poverty and 21 percent of us are unemployed or underemployed. If the PSC is serious about their mission to protect the public interest, they will stop any future rate hikes for BGE customers and give an "F" to BGE for their performance.

Otherwise, we are left with our current policy of pretending like gambling is outlawed, even as more of it creeps across the state.

Addai, who turned 29 on Thursday, has played six seasons in the league, all with Indianapolis, which drafted him in the first round (30th overall) out of LSU in 2006.

The fight had started, as Baker understood it, when Wallace sent Za'Zell to the grocery store to buy something. Za'Zell didn't have enough money, however, so she tried standing outside the store and asking strangers for spare change.

Greenstein and Assemblymen DeAngelo and Benson. Our 1,600 members, families and friends will support the re-election of these candidates.

They have not forgotten their roots. They support the ability of collective bargaining to accomplish the changes that are necessary to meet the challenges of any economic crisis in New Jersey.

Then we must address the money that it will bring in. I am told that it will bring in a half million dollars in fees immediately! That money alone might buy us a little time in making budget decisions regarding our police or the Resource Center, two areas of obvious concern to Pacificans. Then the property tax income will most definitely increase, the residents will be spending their money in Pacifica and their families who visit them will be spending their money in Pacifica, further increasing revenue for the city. It will create jobs. What is negative in that scenario?
Mike Pruitt with Wayne Township fire said the concert is gaining participants and momentum, but organizers still are looking for sponsors.

The scandal and what it's revealed about the culture inside the Secret Service have been a shock to an agency that is famously discreet. More than a dozen Secret Service agents contacted by The Associated Press have abruptly hung up or declined to return multiple messages to discuss their agency and former coworkers.

Second, California is among a handful of states that granted retroactive benefit increases without funding them  the infamous SB 400 of 1999, authored by Sacramento Democrat Sen. Deborah Ortiz, co-authored by Anthony Pescetti, R-Sacramento, and Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento. It passed the Legislature with only seven no votes. That set California on a path to pension crisis.
The most interesting part of the report for Rutgers fans was that to make up the lost Big East game, Rutgers could face Syracuse at home and then again at Yankee Stadium later in the year, with Syracuse as the home team. Both games would count in the Big East standings.

I have no desire to rehash the arguments about why it's okay for Christians to love Harry Potter and the whole world of witchcraft and wizardry it represents. I could say: if you're offended by it, don't read it. I could write about the important values the stories champion, but good literature should never be reduced to moralistic bromide.
Security changes would take years, however. As late as 2005, the fences at some terminals were in shoddy condition, electronic warning systems were unreliable and electronic camera surveillance was spotty. Only in recent years has the Coast Guard given the port stellar ratings for its security.
There were no excuses before.
As the economy improves and people worry less about being frugal, the risk is that retailers will get more complacent and not focus as much on their customers, he added.
For a certain kind of Catholic, this is anathema. They assume only one possible interpretation of Catholic social teaching: their own. So when a Republican House budget chairman dares suggest that his approach to taxes and spending also rests on a moral foundation, the cry goes up: Partisanship! Social Darwinism! War on the Poor!
"To some extent, who wouldn't be depressed?" said Baker. "Who would enjoy this?"

Walsh said his office is working to identify any other dispensaries near schools and said the crackdown may extend to other types of medical-marijuana businesses — such as cultivation operations — that are close to schools.
Sometimes the bombs find their targets; sometimes they level a family home. In his fourth novel, James Meek, a former war correspondent, makes the well-worn point that unseen enemies can be demonized and thus easier to erase. But Meek adds a compelling level of intimacy by arguing that killing without truly knowing who you are killing is as dangerous as loving someone at arm's length, something his protagonist Adam is expert at.
Former Liberian President Charles Taylor deserves an 80-year sentence for the war crimes he was convicted of last week, including abetting murder and rape on a mass scale by arming rebels in Sierra Leone in exchange for "blood diamonds," prosecutors at the Special Court for Sierra Leone said. The court cannot assess the death penalty.
"We ought to be using it more," he said.

Ford, among others, has instituted numerous programs to improve care to people who are chronically ill, including the reduction of hospital infections. Two years ago, it decided to spend an extra $35,000 a year to purchase catheters coated with drugs and other materials to ward off germs. In the end, the investment should more than offset the $32,000 cost to treat each patient who acquires an infection in the hospital, officials said.
Other residents lamented that the development would mean the demolition of the 100-unit Clarkchester apartments, whose residents must now relocate.
Fifty years ago, America was just waking up to the reality of environmental pollution: Rachel Carson had published Silent Spring, heralding the modern environmental movement and raising America's consciousness about the impact of DDT pesticide use on the environment and public health. Then, in 1969, Cleveland's Cuyahoga River caught fire due to the oil-soaked debris consuming it, and the country's then-largest oil spill occurred in Santa Barbara, California. The culmination of these events inspired the call for a national day promoting environmental education and lead to the creation of the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.
Tensions were so high that when Jeffrey Kightlinger, now the general manager at Metropolitan, started with the agency in 1995 one of his first tasks was to see if San Diego County could be kicked out of the alliance of water districts.

Mladic, like Karadzic, is charged with masterminding the worst Serb atrocities of the Bosnian war, from ethnic cleansing campaigns early in the conflict to the deadly campaign of shelling and sniping during the siege of Sarajevo to the 1995 murder of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, Europe's worst massacre since World War II.

Paquin and Moyer, 42, recently announced that they are expecting their first child together. Moyer already has two children from a previous relationship - son Billy and daughter Lilac.
Yet "Marigold Hotel" is too well made to be dismissed and contains too much truth to be scorned. Based on a novel by Deborah Moggach, the screenplay takes a half-dozen stories and mingles them, and yet each character's through-line is effective on its own. There's Tom Wilkinson, quite moving as a man who returns to India after 40 years to seek out the lover of his youth. There's Judi Dench - truly lovely and completely open here - as a grieving widow with money troubles. And Maggie Smith, as a former maid (with the demeanor of a duchess) recovering from a hip replacement.

As dusk deepens, and an evening chill begins to set in, we coax a fire to life, and I learn something new about camp cooking. I usually eat freeze-dried meals when camping. They're lightweight and easy to fix. Just add boiling water to the bag and let it cook in its pouch for 10 minutes. The taste - well, the food is hot. And did I mention how easy they are to fix?

Highlights were a New Orleans-style jazz brunch with shrimp, grits and crab cake eggs benedict, a three-course dinner featuring duck breast with orange-currant sauce and dessert beignets, and excellent beef brisket po' boys served at an outdoor bar-restaurant called the River Grill.
So how does HB 1280 try to maneuver around this obstacle? It blithely declares a "video lottery terminal" is not "a machine or device defined as a slot machine" in the constitution. Yet as bold as that claim might be, it is also illegitimate.
Gibbs' arrival may signal the reopening of the pipeline from Seton Hall Prep to Seton Hall — one that had been responsible for the last period of Pirate NCAA Tournament success almost a decade ago. Among the players who came from West Orange to South Orange to help lead the Pirates to the tournament were Marcus Toney-El (1999) and Jamar Nutter (2003).

"Without a mandate the law is a lot less effective," said MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who advised the Obama administration and, earlier on, then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who put such an insurance mandate in that state's health care law. "The market will not collapse, but it will be a ton more expensive and cover many fewer people."

I think the answer has to do with the fact that with most diets you're always hungry. And what's worse, when you do finally get to eat something, it's rarely something you enjoy eating. There's all that delicious food out there, and what do you end up with? A celery stalk and some brown rice. Washed down with some green tea. Blech!
Vocal at Vietnam War protests, Ruby made his presence known. He studied Eastern philosophy and always carried a book in his back pocket.
The team is trying to balance the seriousness of the competition with the fun of the overall experience, Zamarione said.
Over the years they tried flax, sorghum, soybeans, field peas and chickpeas. Barley, mustard and spelt. They continue looking for something that will work in a planting rotation with wheat. The latest contender is camelina, which produces oil-rich seeds that can be used to make biodiesel.
Plumage of Amazonian variety filled the cavernous abbey as some 1,900 guests filed in, the vast majority of women in hats, some a full 2 feet (.6 meters) across or high. One BBC commentator diplomatically noted there were some "very odd choices" in fashion walking through the abbey door. Most men, however, looked elegant and suave in long tails, some highlighted by formal plaid pants and vests. Others wore military uniforms.
"The employment recovery in San Jose and Silicon Valley has been very, very strong," Sweetnam said. "We are seeing a recovery in spending and retail sales. It's too early to say we are out of the woods, but we have turned a nice little corner."

And it all adds up to a classic bullying scene. Your brother-in-law is the bully, your sister-in-law is his validation -- mean people generally think they're justified, not mean -- your husband is the victim, their parents and other relatives are the under-outraged bystanders (perhaps with their own agendas), and you're the one watching it all and saying, "Um, isn't anyone going to do anything?"

The younger Robert Schuller joined hands with his son-in-law, Chris Myatt, who runs Dallas-based American Life Network.

"In our backyard in the peak of summer, there are 300,000 bees in our hives. We hardly see them. Bees are busy collecting nectar and pollen. The only complaint came from one neighbor who wanted to see more of them in her yard," said John. Replacing a 35-year skydiving hobby, he planted his feet firmly in beekeeping. Five years ago he asked his wife, a Master Gardener, why he saw no honeybees in her gardens. The honeybee's dramatic decline of recent decades piqued their interest. "The next thing I knew we were buying hives and honeybees," he said.

THE looks that designers sent down the men's spring runways in Milan and Paris won't hit the racks until next year. But if you live in Southern California, you've already seen them — or something like them, as brands from staid Hermès to quirky Viktor & Rolf and everyone in between went California casual, dressing down and making it clear that the Golden State's influence on what men wear has expanded far beyond the surf breaks, skate parks and denim bars.

In the last year, they were more likely to be employed as waiters, waitresses, bartenders and food-service helpers than as engineers, physicists, chemists and mathematicians combined (100,000 versus 90,000). There were more working in office-related jobs such as receptionist or payroll clerk than in all computer professional jobs (163,000 versus 100,000). More also were employed as cashiers, retail clerks and customer representatives than engineers (125,000 versus 80,000).
But given our tough fiscal straits, we should be streamlining expenditures, not duplicating them.
Pearl's Deluxe Burgers in San Francisco's Tenderloin makes a convincing case for sliding back into old eating habits. Save for the dulcet lavender stucco walls, the tiny space has no decor to speak of. But the menu -- a near duplicate of the restaurant's first location, Pearl's Phat Burgers, in Mill Valley -- cuts right to the caloric chase with satisfying renditions of fully loaded hamburgers.

I was very pleased to see Baltimore restaurants represented within the grounds. Dave Rather of Mother's Federal Hill Grille deserves credit for corralling his neighboring restaurants on the south side, which were effectively marooned by the race's layout. The crowds couldn't come to them, so they came to the crowds. There were good showings by Ryleigh's Oyster, Jimmy's Famous Seafood, Cazbar, South Beach Sandwicherie in the Budweiser Block Party on Turn 4.
Yet the meter, with its hinged metal lid, clock-like face and sturdy construction, is an impressive mechanism. It might look good for its age, and some have seen the other side of 30, but being old is a problem. Even when they still work — accurately measuring the flow of water that moves through them — they require tending. Someone has to loosen that lid nut, scare off those bugs, sometimes pump out ground water, then read the settings on the dial.
After seemingly months of watching theatrical trailers promoting “Dolphin Tale,” I certainly expected more sap than strength from this story of the rescued title animal being aided immensely by a mechanical tail.
Deasy outlined the allegations in an April 13 letter to the school. The Board of Education is scheduled to vote May 1 on whether to take the first step to revoke Birmingham's charter. Officials could not recall a similar action against a school that became an independent charter.
Most notably, when he was deputy chief, Suhr was one of the command staff members indicted in 2003 for allegedly conspiring to obstruct the investigation into the infamous Fajitagate affair, in which three off-duty cops allegedly beat up two men for their Mexican takeout.
David West Read's delicate new drama, "The Dream of the Burning Boy," makes its points gently. Too gently, perhaps -- the play feels slight, even if the cast hits precisely modulated grace notes.
The other kind is the one that speaks to a desire for rudimentary dance-floor schlock — the kind of schlock intense enough to batter down national and cultural barriers. Few were willing to defend "Macarena" when it was sweeping the globe, but radio stations couldn’t stop playing it, and pop fans couldn’t stop dancing to it. These songs are, simultaneously, runaway chart successes and cultural jokes. Even as we’re doing the steps, we recognize that there’s something slightly embarrassing about the way we fell for the big beat. It speaks to the collective frailty of the human psyche, and how easily manipulated it is.
Ventura is long on patience, short on "foofery." His pregame meeting with media lasted about seven minutes, about half of Ozzie Guillen's typical on-the-record chats that usually dragged on after the notepads and microphones had been put away.

The speckled, shield-shaped bugs crawl through cracks in window frames, vents or foundations, then send out an aggregation pheromone, not the same chemical that gives the bug its name, to attract others.
Nor should you have been reticent. It would be insulting to assume that someone that close for that long would think only of herself and not be happy for you. But at the same time, your roommate needs to make plans, and to do that, she needs to know when you are changing your living arrangements. Now is the time to tell her that.

In 2004, Rainford called Morgan Quitno "charlatans." In 2005, it was "worthless." And in 2006, when St. Louis was named the most dangerous city on the day of the Cardinals' 2006 World Series parade, Rainford branded the company president "this guy who's working in his pajamas and his bare feet in his mother's basement on his PC."

In Tunisia, several hundred women have already taken to the streets to voice their concern about what an Islamic revival, should it come, could mean for them. In Egypt, women's rights activists immediately mounted a petition drive when the committee named to draft a new constitution included not a single woman (although many noted female Egyptian lawyers could easily serve on that committee).

John Stauffer's "Giants," a parallel biography of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, is an original, eloquent, unsentimental examination of both men and their legacies. Stauffer is cold-eyed about his subjects, particularly Lincoln. He paints a scene in the White House in the fall of 1861, when Jessie Fremont -- daughter of Sen. Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri and wife of John C. Fremont, the Union officer who unilaterally issued his own emancipation proclamation in 1861 (thus freeing the slaves of Confederate sympathizers in Missouri) -- came to see Lincoln, who pointedly did not ask her to sit down.
