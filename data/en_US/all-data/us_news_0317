Both times Louisville, after scoring field goals, went into a full-court press, thus there were no formula-driven close-ups of the player who scored, no crowd, cheerleader, parents or bench shots.

Sens. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have worked effectively for this state during the past 12 years.

Honduras now has the highest homicide rate in the world, much of which is blamed on transnational gangs and drug cartels operating in the region. Government corruption tied to drug trafficking has swept across much of Central America.

Of course, Britannica now has a really big competitor. Wikipedia, which was launched in 2001, now has more than 20 million articles in 283 languages. "It's written by over 31 million registered users and countless anonymous contributors worldwide and visited monthly by around 14.5 percent of all Internet users." I know this because I read it in Wikipedia, but because Wikipedia articles are often anonymous, this is one of the few times I've cited it.

Secret Service agents are going to be assigned chaperones (“A minder for Secret Service agents,” Sunday)? And be required to attend ethics classes? Is this high school? Fire the guilty agents and issue a no-nonsense standard-of-conduct policy.

Make no mistake: our food system is dramatically safer than the one our grandparents had. You're still far more likely to die driving to the grocery store than from anything you buy there. That said, in the last decade, we've seen a shift in produce outbreaks -- in terms of the number of outbreaks, the kinds of pathogens and the pattern of attacks -- that is strikingly parallel to changes in the ways we grow and ship produce.

Can Obama run only on that in 2012? Of course not. But the Republicans also aren't allowed to somehow use Bin Laden against him.

Operating a beer only store does not come without struggles however. The actual cost of running such a store may surprise you, “Beer is the worst margin of any alcoholic beverage” said Alvey. “Most liquor stores make their money on cheap liquor with a high margin. Even wine has a much higher margin than beer.” In other words, do not expect to see more stores like this popping up around the metro—even with the Craft Beer boom we have been experiencing recently.

“They all take the biased position that our economic ills can be cured by getting rid of regulations,” said Michele Byers of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation. “I think there’s a sense of alarm. There’s a willingness of environmentalists to give the governor time to get established, to use thoughtful and strategic thinking, but the reports are not thoughtful or strategic. It’s take the ax out. We really would like the governor to stand up, make some proclamations and take a stand on the Highlands, the environment and water, and future of our state.”

Boronda, the original owner (who developed Monterey Jack cheese), was known far and wide for his fiestas and all-encompassing hospitality. This genteel version of a classic Western saloon carries on the tradition at the mahogany-paneled bar, which shares space with the restaurant. Stiff, generous drinks are poured by the stone fireplace when temperatures plunge, by the pool when the hot Carmel Valley sun is beating down.

As for General Dempsey's three assumptions, one could make the following rebuttal. First, probably because U.S. analysts were badly burned by their experience in Iraq in 2003 when they incorrectly asserted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, there is a great deal of caution in the U.S. intelligence and defense communities about claiming that Iran is building a nuclear weapon. This despite the experience of the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors during their recent visits to Iran, when they were denied access both to the site where they suspect Iran has been working to develop conventional explosives that could trigger nuclear warheads and to the information they sought on Iran's suspected nuclear weaponization program.

Where to dine: So many options, so little time ... but if budget is an issue, that can pleasantly narrow the choices for warming up.

Indeed, Oxford is hardly a school that attracts, or is able to accommodate, all of the brightest students from across the 33,000-student district it serves. Virtually all students are admitted to Oxford at age 10 or 11, while they are still sixth-graders in elementary school. The school only admits eighth- and ninth-graders if someone drops out; after ninth grade, students who leave are not replaced.

Out of sight, out of mind, out of options. I remember my first glimpse of the dark anger that provokes. I also know the futility of that feeling, and I guess I understand why so much anger today is directed at smaller, closer targets.
Justin Rogers, MLive.com: "Brooks has said in a number of interviews that he models his game and work ethic after Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. Working out with Bryant's trainer, Tim Grover, in preparation for the draft, has some analysts, and even Grover himself, acknowledging Brooks' similarities to his idol. 'I don't like that,' Brooks said during an interview at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago. 'I think the respect I have for Kobe is out of this world. I look up to him. I don't think anyone that hasn't scored a point in the NBA should be compared to him.'"

øI would not expect Shanahan to leave the league office any time soon, not with collective-bargaining negotiations upcoming. He will want to see his player safety department fully developed before he leaves. But he's a player in his heart, and he undoubtedly misses wins and losses.

A lot of it has to do with what I have been listening to, what has been playing in my head. I like to start by feeling musical and wanting to communicate and connect, and then I channel that to what I'm playing. However, sometimes I just get the bug to "play some changes," and that will invariably find me sitting on a jazz gig, or practicing jazz. Sometimes the opposite happens as well, and I end up playing etudes and solos for an extra hour as well.

ROUND THREE -- To his credit, Judge Weissbrodt jumped into the middle of the action.

That's a worthy goal for Americans, whether they are primarily interested in limiting greenhouse gases, increasing energy efficiency or weaning the U.S. from its dependency on hostile governments abroad.

While it looked beautiful, the kitchen missed an opportunity to wow us because the cooks forgot the salt entirely, and the dish was disappointingly bland. Unfortunately, the restaurant doesn't provide salt and pepper at the table, and we weren't able to find a waiter until we were nearly finished. Another dish, the haddock ($30), also needed a hefty dose of salt, and the accompanying chorizo didn't sufficiently perk up the bed of underdone white beans in a fragrant broth.

And that's the idea her son needs to present to her, kindly. "This is just how Mom is" is an indefensible position when Mom is plainly suffering. And while not all suffering is within reach of treatment (or of one's well-meaning children), the facts that she's not in treatment for her anxiety, and that loved ones aren't urging her to seek it, mean it's still an active possibility that her pain can be relieved.

McClendon's borrowing habits mirror Chesapeake's own. He needed the loans because he's been buying interests in new wells faster than wells were drilled.

He, also known as "Pearl," was detained in Nanjing, where she lives, on April 27 and sent a text message a week later saying she had been allowed to return home.
Thirteen years later, periodical cicadas will be back in the air, and experts say people annoyed by the insects' mating call and the damage they can inflict on plants will have to grin and bear it. Insecticides won't work, and wrapping plants in protective mesh may be more trouble than it's worth.

A. Well, the reason I couldn't come forward before was because I was ashamed. I was ashamed of what had happened to me. I was ashamed of where I was at in my life. I wasn't proud of myself.

And I want to send that message to other victims and help. This event in my life, that's what I feel it was meant to do. It was meant to help me be able to help others.

Curry is one of a dozen Oregon counties expected to face insolvency within a year or two with the end of federal payments.

Kathleen Marshall of Philadelphia only learned her son, Kevin, had a blood-lead level of 7.5 after USA TODAY requested the boy's test results (with her permission) from the state health department.
