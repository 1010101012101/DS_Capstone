NERAX is a 15 year thing, a unique event that takes place in a VFW hall about the size of two double-bay garages. It's determinedly low-tech (as befits a cask festival), but the beer's tremendous -- they pour about 90 British and American cask beers (and a few ciders), all in beautiful condition -- and the food is barbecue sammiches from Redbones. You pay to get in, and you pay for your beer, but you can get 1/4, 1/2 or full imperial pints; your choice. Awesome. You know how good it is? Paul Pendyck from the Bulls Head in Lititz was there Friday afternoon...and he had his own cask event the next day back home. He flew up and back on Friday because he wasn't going to miss NERAX.

I have met his mother, brother and one if his sisters. His father is no longer alive but his mother is a lovely woman who will tell you exactly what she thinks, and thankfully she thinks I am lovely! And last week she also met kiddo. When I see the way Noel treats his mother is fills my heart with fondness and joy. We have been there twice and first time he brought her flowers and a card for mothers day, the second time he stopped at the shop and bought her food he knew she would like. And both times he has rummaged through her fridge making sure she's eating, offering to cook something for her, checking that she is managing ok, even though one of the other sons are living with her during the week and one of the sisters are practically next door.
It's been ten days. I've got 16,006 words under my belt, but we're out of school tomorrow so hopefully I'm going to get ahead - 20,000 by tomorrow will make me immensely happy.
Twenty plus years later, my handwriting is still bad–my lowercase B looks like a six, for example. But it’s more than that. No matter what I do, how hard I try, there is always something off. My skirts always have mystery stains or dog hair, my picture frames are never straight no matter what tools I use, my eyeliner always ends up pooled under my eyes despite all the chemical precautions I take against it, my hair is always lumpy or slightly undone, my cooking is always a shade too dark or too light, my essays always have one typo, my car always has a scratch, my left earrings keep disappearing . . . essentially everything in my life, despite my best intentions, is always smudged, rippled, browned, snagged, scuffed, crooked, chipped, or warped. It’s like I’m stumbling, tripping, sliding, and skidding through life. In a word: I’m off.

Spring or to be quite specific, ”blossom time” in the Twenty Valley, is absolutely my FAVOURITE time of the year! I wait for this little piece of heaven to unfold with great anticipation. The first signs that the greatest show on earth is about to commence is the “brightening” of the little gold finches’ plumage as the hours of daylight increase. Before long, I see the return of some of my favourite songbirds – red winged black birds, thrushes, blue birds, orioles and the lowly robin. I even get a smile from seeing the ridiculous Canada Geese honking from the peak of the cooking school roof and defecating merrily everywhere they go!

A group of writers recently asked what role anger plays in individual action. I suggest it plays the role of occupancy, for if I was not as incensed about this as I am, I would simply pay the fine and move on with my day. But I can’t do that. My outrage cannot be tamed so easily. I ask… no, I demand that you pardon my sisters and I. By doing so you will set a precedent. One that offers kindness in the face of harshness, one that says we value you, Oh, Mothers of this world!, and we support your kinship. If you step up to this plate, Madame/Sir Judge, I can promise you something in return.
It was kind of nice to be able to make a little joke about feeling cursed because the people in our lives keep dying. Talking about how sad you are that your babies died. I think it was nice for her to be able to call her 6 week loss, her baby, which I haven't heard her say before. Morbid? Probably. Freeing? Definitely.
I spent all my time drunk, in the pub from opening till closing, I cut off my hair – literally, I hacked at my long hair leaving barely an inch of hair over my head; and using the scissors I had just chopped my hair with I slashed my arms and legs terrifically. I still wanted to die but my partner and best friend made sure to remove all sharp objects and all medication and constantly checked that I had neither accessible to me. I made plans to crash my car, to jump off a bridge onto the highway and other ideas to take my life that kept spinning around me, each time someone interfered preventing it from happening.

This is not a book you read: you look things up in it, and as with most good dictionaries and reference works, one thing leads to another. . . I was leafing through the first copy of our reissue, when I came across ‘Eftsoons’. I don’t pretend to be able to recall huge tracts of the Bible verbatim, as John Ruskin could, but I couldn’t quite hear it as a Biblical word. And I couldn’t, because it isn’t. One of the joys of the Bible Word-Book is that it doesn’t just cover the Bible and Prayer Book: the word is listed because it occurs in the Act of Uniformity of Queen Elizabeth (1559), which imposed the use of Cranmer’s Book of Common Prayer in churches and so institutionalised the use of the vernacular which eventually led to the King James Version of the Bible. The supporting quotations are from More’s Utopia, Spenser’s Faerie Queen, Sylvester’s Du Bartas, The Tropheis (??? – your guess is as good as mine!) and Holland’s translation of Plutarch’s Moralia.

Fall is my absolute favorite time of the year, where I pretend it's not 85 degrees out and dream of all the outfits I am going to wear when I can finally pull out my leather boots, when the slightest dip in the temperature feels so cold, and I can paint my nails my favorite taupe OPI color.

Ok, so I basically try to calm myself down. Yes, I hyperventilate when someone insinuates that I am of marriageable age. I guess it has a lot to do with the fact that I don’t view myself as an adult, and by the way that’s one of the tricks of growing up, you don’t feel any different.

Goals that you set should be within your reach otherwise it will be exhausting on your part doing a lot yet not reaching anything. Goals should be set so as not to go astray in life. There is just a limited chance that you will be successful with this kind of endeavor but if you set certain goals, you have high chances of succeeding. You have to see yourself as someone and not just anyone in the future. Furthermore, you must have a plan and a clearer view on how your investment will turn out.
First of all He is our shepherd. He leads us beside still waters to drink. Sheep will not drink from moving water, actually sheep will drink nasty dirty still water than drink fresh moving water. Much like us who will quench our thirst on the muck this live gives us rather than seek the goodness God can give us. We need someone to help us see the bad and to lead us to the good. The 23rd psalm goes through many renditions of how dumb sheep are and how they will follow after each other creating ruts and not finding good pastures and dirty water. We need a person to lead us to the good things that God has provided. Jesus will lead us if we will let Him.

2) CHARCOAL -Charcoal is the dark grey residue consisting of impure carbon obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and vegetation substances. Charcoal is usually produced by slow pyrolysis, the heating of wood or other substances in the absence of oxygen (see pyrolysis, char and biochar). The resulting soft, brittle, lightweight, black, porous material resembles coal. Charcoal in art: Charcoal is used in art for drawing, making rough sketches in painting and is one of the possible media for making a parsemage. It must usually be preserved by the application of a fixative. Artists generally utilize charcoal in three forms:

On a thread dying note, I forgot to mention that I tried dyeing some Lizbeth. People love Lizbeth, it's a fact, but its usually tricky. The thread that I dyed above was using the microwave method. (Mix up an itty bitty dye bath in a cup, put the thread in, swirl it around to the water is covering it and microwave for a minute.) The results have turned out wonderfully! So I thought I would give Lizbeth another go.

This morning we got up and Patti had made breakfast, so we had orange danish rolls, coffee & juice, bacon & sausage...It was a splendid morning in Shreveport, cold but nice. We walked down to the dock and looked at the lake a bit before heading out. We got a late start again (left at 10 or so) and it took us longer than planned. We drove pretty much all day, and not much happened, which is probably a good thing when you're on a road trip. Gabe stayed up late last night, but still didn't take a nap. Still, he was an excellent traveling companion once I told him whining was not allowed in the car. We only stopped a few times, but he did much better than yesterday, even though the trip was longer. At about 7, I gave up on getting to Florida tonight. We were both tired of being in the car, and I didn't want to stress about how far we drove. We decided at the beginning that we'd just take it as it came, and get as far as we got, and that would be fine. We have vague goals, but nothing set in stone. So, we stopped in Gulfport MS and got a hotel room.

Dear Prime Minister,
Psychological Effect: Although I no longer fear my family I am constantly reminded of my history as a youth. I constantly yearn to be able to be weak and vulnerable but all such attempts result in abuses. I naturally fear being vulnerable to people because I fear they will make me feel guilty about my actions and therefore question my motives, morally. When I refuse to feel guilty, they will punish me emotionally to the point where I will no longer be affected by them.
Sadly, this "pursuit of happiness" mindset pervades so many facets of life, that a lot of professed Christians get the God-given right wrong and misapply it. Myself included - the temptation to always "do what I want" instead of "doing what I ought" is difficult to resist. There's heroic virtue in suffering, and so many folks don't get it. Folks like Robertson, obviously - you'd think he'd know better.

Lily is only seven when a matchmaker tells her family she wants to make Lily a laotong with Snow Flower, a girl from another village. A laotong relationship will not only bring respect to Lily’s impoverished family, but will bind Lily and Snow Flower forever, making them old sames. Lily and Snow Flower become good friends, and remain so through their marriages and the birth of their children. Their friendship is documented on a fan they pass between then in the language of women of the day, even though the use of this language is not permitted and must be done in secret. But through their determination to communicate with each other, the reader in keenly aware of the inner struggle the women have toward the way society demands they be treated and the obligation to behave as expected.

According to the “airport procedure” (Flughafenverfahren) for the processing of asylum seekers, the refugees received at the airport will be taken through an expedited asylum process. Their application will be processed in two days. If the application is approved—or if the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees fails to reach a decision within the two days—the refugees are allowed to stay and go through the regular asylum application procedure (outside the airport). If they are denied, they would have three days to appeal the decision—and only upon denial do they get the opportunity to receive legal advice. The Administrative Court would then have 14 days to review the appeal and make a final determination, either to allow asylum or to deport the refugee.

What better word to abbreviate than Australia. Australia has 4 syllables, that takes a lot of effort to say that, lol. A lot of Aussies blend syllables too, so it comes out sounding like Ozstraya. Most of the time we call it Aus, from there it's been shortened to the written version, Oz. So now you know why Aussies refer to their homeland as Oz and remember that when you pronounce the word "Aussie" you say it with a z not an s.

When you truly put first things first, all other things fall in line. Confusion dissipates. Decisions are much less difficult. If an activity or commitment fits with what you value most and what you believe God is calling you to do, the answer is yes. If an activity or commitment doesn’t fit with your priorities, the answer is an unapologetic no. Instead of feeling torn, you can rest in the knowledge that you are right on target—putting your energy where it needs to be.
Unfortunately for our leaders, and for their dangerous daydream, history has a way of repeating itself, and dawn will come no matter how you may cling to a dream. They should fear for their dream will not come true, and it will soon be revealed for what it is. It is then that reality may cast them into the void, as it did to the last queen of France.
The sad thing is that major investigations uncovering huge financial irregularities in France on the part of the Bongos have been shelved. The investigations have been shelved because French authorities believe that if they move against the Bongos they (the Bongos) may retaliate by punishing French businesses in Gabon and deny them access to the lucrative oil deals. Till today not a penny of the millions of dollars of Gabonese money believed to have been stolen by Bongo and hiding in French banks has been returned. This is what brings the hypocrisy of French politicians like Lagarde out clearly. While shouting ‘No safe havens for dirty money’ at the same time they are keeping billions of such monies in their banks with no indication that they are ever going to return them.

As one of Africa’s most prominent musicians, Rocky Dawuni continues to make a powerful mark both on and off the stage. His innovative and progressive fusion of Reggae, Afro Beat, and traditional African sounds has been featured on major network hits including Weeds, ER, and Dexter, to name a few. But what truly makes Rocky Dawuni one of the most important musicians of his time, is his use of music as a tool for social development. He is the founder of “Rocky Dawuni Independence Splash,” an annual music festival that takes place in his native Ghana, bringing together 30,000+ people each year to raise awareness about Africa’s water sanitation issues, the AIDS/HIV dilemma and youth development. Rocky is also a personality for Product (RED) led by U2’s front man Bono and Bobby Shriver, dedicated to The Global Fund’s initiativeson HIV/ AIDs in Africa.

Greg Leitich Smith's previous middle grade novels were pretty firmly located in contemporary school settings, but in his author's note to his new book, Chronal Engine, he says he's always loved survival stories and dinosaurs. That love shows, and so does a sympathy for his young teen characters. They find themselves in a setting where Jurassic Park meets, oh, maybe Jules Verne, with echoes of Conan Doyle's Lost World and possibly a touch of Robinson Crusoe, all of it pulled together with an adventure story sensibility that is squarely and effectively aimed at the middle grade reader. I had great fun talking to Greg about Chronal Engine. Here's Part 1 of a two-part conversation.

It is an update of the older photo you see on the laptop. Stock Photo Woman looks a bit older, her hair is shorter, but she is still her perky self, smiling her way into an old man’s heart. How sweet! How sick! Both are correct. I know who this captivating woman is but her name still remains a secret. She has a tiny little presence on the web, besides her huge presence as a stock photo model. What is it about this woman? She is beautiful and yet quite ordinary in some ways, like a woman you could actually meet. I still would love to hear her voice and see her move. Oh Yes! I am still in love with this product of fashion and photography at it’s most basic marketing level. Kudos to fotolia. Do you realize what you have in this woman? Does Andres Rodriguez, the photographer, realize that this model is a potential goldmine. Put her in a few videos, a commercial would be nice. We need more of this woman in our impoverished lives. At least I do. Please? Just one little ad where I can hear her voice and watch her move that fabulous body. Could you do this for me? A silly old man sitting in front of his computer in his pajamas? Ok, I guess I’m not all that old really, not even sixty, but silly? You betcha. And horny too. Oops! I have said too much. Don’t tell her, please. I want to keep this affair pure and innocent. What is it about her? Who the hell knows. Men have been tormented by such sirens since the dawn of time. Call her Helen of Troy, call her Sophia, the Goddess of Wisdom, or Diana, the Goddess of the Hunt, or call her whatever you like, just call her. Because we all need this woman.
I reminded the congregation of the funeral that Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago conducted back in 1988, when he buried two thousand aborted babies. When asked about the legal implications of the burial, he responded that such concerns paled to insignificance in comparison to the evil of taking innocent human life. He said he was doing a corporal work of mercy – to bury the dead.
Asked if there will be road closures during the marching of environmental coalition Himpunan Hijau which will make its way from KLCC to the Australian High Commission tomorrow, Mohmad said: “It depends on the situation.”
Anyway the gauntlet has been laid by Karen, who if you look on the SN blog, has a great wee charm that made me giggle with a reference to muffins.
The line to get into the Montague Street Ricky's -- the "hottest, craziest Halloween costume superstore in New York City" -- extended down the block by 4:30 Friday (Halloween) afternoon. Someone on line told us it was the same deal the day before.
In front of the right side of the DVD? An amethyst heart paperweight - I found it when I was cleaning out the back room a few months ago, and decided it was too pretty to be in a box. So now it is cluttering my workspace.
A few rumours have flown around Internet-land about this record for awhile, and one theory is that this is actually DDDBMT larking around. However, I think the most likely explanation is that The Potatoes were a studio based creation, and for whatever reason Fontana decided not to get behind them and gave this record a half-hearted release later than originally planned. The concept was floated again with DDDBMT, an act with a strong chart history behind them, and once that record took off the whole matter was forgotten. As nobody concerned has ever come forward to clarify matters, that's probably the only answer we're going to get.
I show up and guess what: He doesn't. I just sit outside of his house for like an hour, waiting for him to get home and then leave, carrying an ass-ton of hurt pride and an endless loop of my friend's voice saying "I TOLD you so," going through my head.
The setup is pretty nice given that we’re seeing the story developing as a relationship between Koko and Jonah. Jonah looks like a wolf, too, but I suppose we’ll get to see if Jonah only looks the look or not. For starters, he might not even rock the look that Koko does.
I made reservations a few weeks in advance for the Old Lahaina Luau (OLL). There are a few different companies but based on my research, OLL has the most authentic Hawaiian show. Having grown up in Hawaii, I've had all of the foods typically served at a luau, but never attended one. Tony had never been to one either. The ticket prices were high but I was able to get a military discount. Seat choices (closest to stage and back) are by first booked, first served. When I called I just asked the woman to pick any day that we were in Maui that had the best available seats.
Tired of feeling like I didn’t measure up.
I'm serious, not even Coleridge's famous ode

There’s nothing like a well-chewed pen cap from days past. Though pen caps don’t have much taste, your tongue remembers well enough. And in the lamplight of one a.m., your mind heaves a heavy sigh over political and hypocritical, and too hot and too bothered about these things. There’s a subtlety how your mind crossed over from serene to shouting; how your handwriting goes from an okay cursive to a messy scrawl. You turn the next page.

Breakfast was at a small cafe in the train station that served Veg Puffs (pastries stuffed with potatoes, string beans, and peas and loaded with spices) and chai. The 25 rupee bill was a good sign that I had found the NFT (Not For Tourists) part of India. I think I have mentioned that I love the food here several times, but I don’t think it can be said enough. There is a subtle joy in eating food with your hands; it is as if your taste buds migrate to your finger tips and textures are enjoyed on a whole new dimension. Cleaning your bowl with a piece of naan is fantastic, but still does not compare to licking your fingers after a delicious meal.
Of course, it is sometimes difficult to get candidates all together on the same night but I understand that, if candidates could not attend, they had the option of sending along a representative to speak on their behalf. Sadly, that offer was not taken up.

In a large mixing bowl, combine flours, baking powder, pinch of salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, combine sugar, egg, milk, vegetable oil, and orange zest and juice. Mix well. Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until ingredients are just combined. Gently fold in the cranberries and nuts.

Alice Austen is also an important figure in gay and lesbian history, although she might have recoiled from the word 'lesbian', a term which seemed to apply more to the debauched female bohemians of Greenwich Village than an old-money doyenne living in a seaside cottage. In 1899, she met Brooklyn school teacher and dance instructor Gertrude Tate and began a companionship that culminated in 1917 when Gertrude, over objections from her family, moved into Clear Comfort with Alice.
The bourgeois world is always against ‘change’ precisely because it is the principal beneficiary of the world as it is ordered. In contemporary Indian life the dynamics of globalization and of course bourgeois India’s ever-greater participation in the same comes at a political cost. The message is ‘don’t be too bothered by caste trouble somewhere in Bihar because you have your multiplex to go to… and if you don’t like this arrangement remember all the buses you missed while the crowed was roughing you up’! Political quiescence can always be purchased by economically empowering a certain class. This is the whole ‘auntie’ phenomenon. Not meant as an insult. But it is the values of this ‘sign’ that become empowered in ‘new India’. This is what multiplex cinema caters to. And it is this structure that also disallows certain questions from being raised in commercial cinema. When I then militate against this structure it is not because I am permanently opposed to the same but because this is the one that happens to predominate. And so when people sometimes wonder why I do not criticize the excesses of the left or various kinds of caste violence or what have you it is because those events unfortunate as they might be do not set the ‘national’ agenda. They’re important in a very local sense (and that’s great in some ways) but they do not define the normal ‘values’ of the state. Which is why state and/or bourgeois violence is never defined as such whereas the Maoist is immediately identified for his. Obviously the latter is frightening but we don’t see the frightening part of what was done to him (or her)! The multiplex audiences are the beneficiaries of what happens in other parts of India. They enable this system. How? When entire villages are dispossessed to create a powerful dam that then is a great step ‘forward’ for the nation except that the beneficiaries of this are not the same who were earlier dispossessed! The latter can then live lives of even greater penury elsewhere or become militants of some sort. We see the violence of the latter but never the original violence that forced this choice upon them. Though Paan Singh Tomas wasn’t sophisticated enough a film to really develop all of this these are the basic contours of the story. And of course Raavan in exemplary fashion. Which is why it caused so many so much indigestion!

solar lamp - two workers from the Heart-Heart Foundation came to Mtwara, and as a part of their trip, they wanted to donate two solar lamps (lamps that are charged during the day) to two poor ass students as an experiment prior to a wider distribution. I chose two from the scholarship recipients, and I just cannot forget how their faces brightened up with genuine smile when they heard the news. Unfortunately, one does not work, so there is more work to do.
This is how it operates. You join receive a sample of something ; shall we say it is an acne remedy. This product has a retail value of $50, but all you have to pay is five greenbacks handling and shipping. What you do is send your bill in, and you theoretically get paid $20 for your effort and time, because you’ve got to take the time to cancel the automated monthly cargo of acne cure which you may not have realized is going to be charged to your credit card monthly.

It’s not that I want things so relaxed that public safety is at risk. But I do wonder sometimes, especially when I’ve just enjoyed the ease of a place like Hawaii, if we might not relax things a little more here in Canada.

Ok… I’m so frustrated. I’m stuck. Okay. I’m totally crying. I just want to run away, start over somewhere new where they can’t find me. I want to disappear. I can’t leave here because of my daughter. I am stuck, standing right where I am and they know everything.
They knew Jesus as their personal Savior and Lord. They knew that unthinkable as it might be in their human strength, God was call- ing them to forgiveness and reconciliation. They chose love over hate, forgave those involved in their son’s death, and formed the nonproﬁt Evan Leigh Foster Foundation. Its mission is to reach out to gang members with the message of God’s love and redemption. They have shared that message personally, one on one. They hope and pray that by bringing gang members to faith in the God who can heal and transform them, gang violence will lessen and other children’s lives will be spared. Their choice to love has changed their own and others’ lives eternally and made them a living illustration of Romans 8:28: “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”
The movie was watchable as 70′s science fiction movies go, but it was far from being a great movie. The special effects were overly simplistic and not done very well for the technology available and being used at the time. Most of the dialogue was poorly written and in some instances by the performer’s acting skills. As far as dystopian stories goes, it does a passable job, but could have something so much better than how it turned out. I will be checking out the story the movie is based on and look forward to the rumored re-make, but will not watch this version again. My rating for this movie is a 2.75 out of 5.

Well, what do I know anyway, I'm just another little person slave like so many others, trying to make sense of it, plodding along under darkening clouds. This set of theories presented does not mean climate change does or does not command star billing in the ubiquity of the chemtrail which leaves our door wide open for additional thoughts on the matter and should you have something to share, do feel free. A few weeks ago I mentioned in a comment that if what is happening to the sky's palette was good, beneficial to humanity or healthy and logical and worthwhile, we would have heard about it long ago. The PR would be read, heard, tweeted, televised, trumpeted from sea to shining sea. But instead we are not to know, at least not now.
Some of you may have noticed that the blog posts have been a little sparse recently. And there's not been a single post regarding Thanksgiving (gasp!).

We are girls. We were raised that fairytales were real and good men existed out there and that they were waiting for us. We were told that if you are a good person, good things will come to you.

Following the experience I’ve just alluded to, I posed the question to facebook: What recent films might endure to become classics? I received many fantastic responses, but a friend of intellectual, cultural, and artistic wisdom (whom I will refer to as Elle), who happens to have a particular fondness for everything film, did me one better. She responded to the question with a characteristically thought-provoking post.

Both organizations were having a hard time knocking down the walls of segregation. King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) was training people in non-violent resistance. Adherents to the non-violent movement were attempting to integrate lunch counters, and were being met with violence, but the incidents were not gaining national attention, at least not enough national attention to put pressure on the South to change its ways.
I am so happy to be attending Carol's workshop here in San Antonio. I attended one of her workshops four years ago with my daughter. Now that I've been painting for a couple of years, I can understand and relate to what she is telling us much better than I could the first time. I'm not saying I can DO it, I just can comprehend better!
To a large extent I think birth names come with so much pre-loaded baggage: they are the symbols by which we engage with everyone else in our lives. They take everything people know about us, often accumulated over years and years – what we look like and how we act – and reduce it down to a two-word codeword.
I play with the words in my head. What you wish for, you will get. It sounds like a Chinese curse. She stared at me with such earnestness, such surety, though I know it is not. It humbled me. Was she simply daring me to be responsible with the power to have wishes come true? I stretch the words...what you wish for, you will get. I turn them inside out. It is a mobius strip, you will wish for what you have. Did I wish something? I did wish in the moment she stared at me. I wish for peace of mind most days, serenity, sobriety, for a connection to God, or the divine, or other people. I wish to know my destiny. To know if I should keep pursuing writing, or leave it along the road for another person to pick up. Maybe the answer was yes. Or maybe I really don't want to write anymore. What you wish for, now that is the problem.
Running a rescue can be quite emotionally draining. But there is alot of upside too. The rewards are seeing the successes. Looking into the eyes of a dog that was once broken inside, now living a life filled with love and happiness. I have attached some before and after pictures. These are the moments that remind me of why I continue doing what I do everyday. These are just a few. To date, we will have saved over 250 dogs this year. Next year we want to triple that!

We already have a name for the tsunami wave of extermination: the Holocene extinction event. There’s no asteroid this time, only human behavior, behavior that we could choose to stop. Adolph Eichman’s excuse was that no one told him that the concentration camps were wrong. We’ve all seen the pictures of the drowning polar bears. Are we so ethically numb that we need to be told this is wrong?
The passive voice part seemed puzzling to me for a while. We are to obey the imperative command, but the filling is actually done by the Holy Spirit and we are the subject of the filling so that makes sense. We allow the Holy Spirit to act upon us and control us. If you are anything like me this whole process of letting go of control while obeying this command of being filled is not natural. As I shared yesterday, when you enter this path, your idols are revealed in a hurry. You find out that you are much more self-protective than you even admitted to yourself. You have not really died to self at all and are still clinging to parts of your life that mean absolutely nothing in eternity. As I evaluate myself on this, I find myself indeed lacking. I also find myself continually in the fire and I know that that is a good thing spiritually because that means God is both cleansing me and working in me to mature me, but when I look at what is revealed by this whole process, I see one who must remain in the Valley of Humiliation for quite some time. God’s Will be done.

As a matter of survival and adaptability, however, it is becoming increasingly clear that I have to make a transition from writer to Writer, if I want to keep the wheels turning.

The first stanza paints a familiar picture of loneliness with simple grace – and the clothes they chose that morning/and were seen in all day. That detail is an example of the poet telling us something that we all know – yes, when we choose our outfits for work, we are seen in them all day – yet making it resonate in a new way, almost as a type of resignation.

Unfortunately, Dasha hasn't made a friend in the group. She has not even acquired a "partner in-crime," which is how so many of the friendships start out. The counselors praise her studiousness, though they do not seem to be doing anything to help her develop her social skills. I saw her giggling a little when the boys teased, and I thought perhaps she was going to break into normal adolescence. But the teasing took on more of a taunting nature.

The data don’t capture why a killer felt threatened, or whether the victim was armed. In about 60 percent of justifiable-homicides in which the relationship between victim and killer was known, the pair were strangers. Among all homicides, when races differed, the victim was more often white. In justifiable-homicide cases, the opposite was true: The victim was more often black. Criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University said that difference “is certainly, on the face of it, something that needs to be explored. Could it be an element of racism? You can’t necessarily assume that.” The full article is available only to paid subscribers.
Partly, I think baked beans have gotten a bad rap. Both because of their, um, supposed side effects, and also because of the canned stuff. Watery. Bland. Not so great. Also, I’m not sure that people in general know and appreciate what a true Boston-style baked bean is: white beans baked in a sauce containing pork and molasses. Salty, tangy, and just slightly sweet, they are nothing like you get from a can. They are also super easy to make, either in the oven or in a crock pot.
Then why is it that this concept isn’t applied nation-wide yet? According to Nelson, it is because of bureaucratic issues. Who controls what is taught in classrooms, she asked. Teachers, administrators, state legislature were some of the more common guesses. Wrong. Textbook companies who write both the textbooks and the tests – who determine what material is important enough for students to be tested on – those are the ones who control the classroom environment. This is exactly the issue that needs to be changed – more freedom needs to be given to the teachers, in order for the freedom to be passed on to the students. However, the issue arises as to how to make sure that this new freedom is not misused. Teaching is a low-paid profession in the United States. There is not enough incentive for those who are motivated enough to implement this system of education to enter the profession. They can use their motivation elsewhere where such hard work is actually paid off monetarily. That is a sad realization. In other countries, teachers are valued very highly – as high as doctors, and most definitely more valued than lawyers. An education reform needs to happen, and it seems that Doreen Nelson is already on it.

The fact is that international finance capital is contemptuous of national borders. It only preaches nationalism and racism to keep the workers lined up behind national borders and ready to go to war to defend this or that imperialist power. That’s why workers as a class have to be even more internationalist than their bosses and not fall for the racist nationalism that divides them and sets brother and sister at each other's throat.

Add condensed milk and cook, stirring, until thicker and combined. (Do not allow to burn or curdle or taste will be terrible! This happens very quickly so keep an eye on it!) Pour over biscuit base. Bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until caramel is firm and golden - edges will bubble and darken. Cool, then refridgerate for at least 3 hrs. Cut into squares once cooled. Dust with drinking chocolate before serving, if desired.

This is like making fun of retarded people for acting, well, retarded. Punters are like the weird red-headed kid in the kindergarten class.

Punters are the anatomical equivalent of an appendix. You never notice it until it fucks up, but when it does, it can kill you. And your team.

However, Mr. Kitchen Hand gamely tried soursop ( a relative of the custard apple) and he liked it. This strange wobbly yellow mess that looks like it has frog spawn strewn all over it is actually one of my favourite, recently discovered desserts. The white blobs are soursop flesh, the yellow blobs are herbal jelly (very mild, tastes almost of nothing), and the frog spawn is basil seeds. The green thing at the back is a calamansi lime for squeezing over everything. All this good stuff sits atop a mound of freshly shaved ice. It's the first Asian dessert everyone in the family agrees on. The flavour is tangy and sweet and very, very refreshing.

I just can't end this without exposing you to a very interesting cover version of the song, also sung by a female vocalist, but NOT with different lyrics. This one comes from Nancy Sit from Hong Kong who covered a whole bunch of American and British hits for the Chinese market back in the 1960s. She did a lot of the songs in Chinese, but she tried to tackle this one in English. But I'm not sure she actually understood the words as she sang the song!

Obviously, the links to head trauma to later feelings of depression, and other ailments, cannot be ignored, but my hope is that this tragedy doesn’t further water down the NFL.

He lived and breathed it, and it was obvious he had fun out there.

White asparagus is actually the same species as green, but it's usually kept covered under soil or mulch so that it won't be exposed to the sun, thereby maintaining it's white color. Blah blah blah, chlorophyll borophyll... While doing my research, I did read that the white asparagus is supposed to be more woody than the green and so you are supposed to peel the very outside before preparing it. When I made this recipe, I used it peeled and unpeeled, just because I was curious if it really made a difference, and I didn't notice anything different in the texture. I think that if you let it sit around for a long period of time, then it would start to become woody and tough, much like the green stuff, but if you use it right away it's just fine.

It may come as a shock to those who want to micromanage our lifestyles, but drinkers, smokers and lovers of fast food are not stupid. We’ve got the message that fags, booze and all the other wicked little pleasures are bad for us. The real reason that people engage in moderately unhealthy behaviours like these – so mildly unhealthy that we have to do them often and regularly over the course of decades to cause us serious harm – is that we enjoy them. We balance the long-term risks against short-term pleasure. That’s a far more sophisticated understanding of what it means to live life well than these grey and miserable latter-day Puritans could ever manage.There is far more to life than just minimising every perceived risk. And the Puritans are surprisingly quiet when it comes to sport, most forms of which involve entirely avoidable risks to life and limb.

I was hoping that finding a record of his baptism would be a relatively straightforward matter, since the International Genealogical Index (IGI) has good, albeit not complete, coverage of the parish registers of Derby town, as well as the non-conformist registers. Disappointingly there was no sign of a suitable baptism in the IGI, and a trawl of microfilms of the parish registers for All Saints, St Werburgh, St Alkmund, St Michael and St Peter between 1760 and 1765, kindly carried out for me by Frank Wattleworth, also turned up empty. Spreading the net (and the fishing euphemisms) a little wider, both location- and time-wise, produced a baptism for an Edward Foster on 13 November 1774 at Egginton, a parish seven miles to the south-west of Derby, the son of Edward and Anne Foster.

This is another prosperity gospel based book with nothing new to offer. A short 122 pages, the content is redundant and simple. “The God Pocket” is nothing more than the contemporary idea of ‘passing it forward’ where you do something nice for someone with the hopes that they will keep the momentum. The book tries to add a Christian spin on it while providing no solid reasoning from Scripture.

I imagine an event that is fun for those involved and for those watching.
The bid of the Philippine nation for basketball supremacy comes from the fact that basketball is the most popular sport in the country and decades ago the Philippines was considered a basketball powerhouse, especially in Asia. It is impossible to talk about international basketball before without talking about the Philippines. However, the teams of other countries were able to catch up on us. The basketball program of other countries started to beat ours, added to the fact that the recent Philippine teams almost always gave the size advantage to their opponents. Obviously, size and height is really a deciding factor in the game of basketball especially if size comes with talent and that is what not lacking in Smart Gilas, TALENT. Add talent with proper training, exposure, experience, courage and a fighting heart then I’ll say that we do have a fair chance for Olympic dominance. Besides, some Filipino players of today gives hope to us fans about our size woes. Ateneo de Manila’s Greg Slaughter and De La Salle University’s Arnold Van Opstal stands 6′ 11” (or 7’0”) and 6’9” respectively. These two young players is a sign of hope, since they could be the answer to our size disadvantage in international competitions.
The Jiangnan and Lingnan regions were the most advanced areas by the end of the eighteenth century and could be viewed as the “core”; southwest China (e.g. Sichuan and Yunnan), northeast China, and even southeast Asia (although China’s international trade was insignificant compared with internal trade) could be viewed as the “peripheries”. China’s internal trade patterns, however, were blocked by the import substitution in the middle and upper Yangzi River. During 1750 and 1850, the population growth there exceeded China’s average and local residents began to develop proto-industries on their own instead of importing from the Yangzi delta (Pomeranz, 2000). This was partly because newly developed areas were not located at convenient transport centers and costs would be high if they were to continue importing manufactured goods from Jiangnan. Moreover, the Qing government promoted the gender norm of “men plows, women weaves” and encouraged import substitution in the peripheries. Jiangnan’s ability to exchange manufactures for primary products from the peripheries diminished. The reduced demand lowered profits of rural industries in Jiangnan and discouraged merchants and peasants from production innovation.

It’s a mockery of love and a cop out to romance.
I was also very surprised that hotel staff would allow some one to check into some one elses room just because they knew the check in name. I never confronted the staff about it, but I should have.

In everyday design, architecture, art and interior design, movement is an important force that creates excitement. It keeps the eye roaming and provides interest and hopefully curiosity. By arranging a room in a certain way, the designer forces the eye to move in a particular way, either on purpose or accidentally. If a designer is good, it will be on purpose. Graduation of sizes, shapes, color, light and dark can all have an effect on movement.

Arizona’s answer to the sakura is the Palo Verde (green tree). These trees are all over AZ, and usually they aren’t much to see. However, for a few brief months in the Spring, these trees light up with bright yellow flowers. Usually, the palo verde is mixed in with other desert trees, and you will see these swarms of yellow amidst a sea of green. And if you’re lucky, you’ll see a whole bunch of palo verde trees grouped together, and it turns into a sea of yellow.

Shirley Collins' music is best heard in the small hours of the day, late evening or early morning, when most of the world is sleeping and your own thoughts aren't quite as loud. Equal parts austerity and warmth, her voice wraps around you like a old quilt on a cold day. And her music is the quilt-work of the British Isles, spun by the hands of laborers destined to anonymity as the "small" people of history but whose melodies and words have outlived most music bound to commercialism. Collins has passed that quilt on to successive generations of folk music lovers with her own indelible stitches. She may not have been the first person to commit these songs to tape but her records are held in high esteem as a reference point by both music nuts and music scholars. The further back you go with music that has fallen into the 'public domain', the more variations on the songs you have, and with Shirley's repertoire we are talking very old indeed. So old that those variations are often subjects of debate, and Shirley wrote some of her own melodies using anonymous pieces of song poetry.

"Being married and having a child are different."
The other conclusion I have come to is that such interventions may not be as important for Polly as they are for Pip. As Ava has brought to my attention repeatedly, it’s easy to think that addressing the patterns of gender inequality means altering how women operate in the world. But the reality is that the practices and habits of men drive the reproduction of these patterns. As beneficiaries of these inequalities, men bear greater power and responsibility for acknowledging and changing these patterns than is often recognized. For me living up to this responsibility means creating our interventions with Pip in mind as much as Polly. If Pip grows up sensitive to the historical practices of exclusion and obstruction that determine the unequal nature of the opportunities with which he and Polly are respectively presented in life, then perhaps he can further contribute to the type of cumulative cultural adjustment necessary to eliminate from our world the specter of the false choice and all the associated injustices that still haunt women today.

In recent years, a number of scientific articles were published investigating potential associations between vaccinations and allergies. In a review article by Bernsen et al. from 2006, which summarized study results about the association of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccination, measles/mumps/rubella vaccination, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination with atopic disorders, the authors conclude that according to the available evidence, recommended protective vaccinations do not increase the risk of atopic disorders in children.

The actors are also on career-defining form. Jack Nicholson is at his inimitable best as private eye Jake Gittes (who surly ranks as one of the all-time greatest movie detectives), combining his explosive intensity - that ever-present feeling that he could do or say anything - with an understated, classic movie star elegance. The great director John Huston makes a lasting impression as wealthy patriarch Noah Cross, despite only appearing in two scenes (one of which is at the very end). His courtly and genteel portrayal ensures the character looms large over the whole film.

Soft drinks are only one type of food/beverage that artificial sweeteners have become mainstream in our diet. Jolly Rancher candies, Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Pillsbury brownie mixes, and Vlasic Bread & Butter pickles now can be purchased in “low-sugar” or “sugar-free” varieties thanks to aspartame, Splenda, and sugar alcohols replacing the infamous white crystals. This has been good news for diabetics, dieters, and food distributors nation-wide, but it has also caused eyebrows to rise amongst nutritionists, concerned mothers, and talk-show hosts. Endless books have been written, “60 Minutes” segments have aired nationally, and a plethora of bloggers have gone wild, fighting on both sides of the argument – “pro-sugar” or “con-sugar”. If these substances have been FDA-approved, many ask, “How can they be harmful?” Or on the converse, “how can they be FDA-approved if they may cause harm to a consumer’s health?” Like many food items taken in excess or when combined incorrectly, they can cause detriment to vital processes. For instance, cholesterol is necessary for the structure of cell membranes but too much, especially of the LDL variety is linked to heart disease. In the case of artificial sweeteners, certain variations can prove detrimental for individuals with pre-existing conditions (i.e.: aspartame consumed by people who have phenylketonuria, aka PKU), even leading to seizures. Less frightening consequences, but no less common, include acne, upset stomach, and bad aftertaste.

Then you have to put up with the religious people. There are the people who are straightforward, the people who tell you right away that you’re disgusting and you’re going to Hell. Lots of religious people dance around it, saying they love you but they don’t agree with your “lifestyle choice”. That is STILL homophobia. You STILL believe that my sexuality was a CHOICE, therefore something I could CHANGE, but since I won’t (because I CAN’T), I’m going to Hell. I don’t believe in Heaven or Hell, but if you do, it still hurts to hear that you think I deserve to burn for all of eternity because of who I love.
This is a fine Italian restaurant which has only recently been opened.

Excellent service, fantastic food and a great experience was had, and will hopefully have again when I’m next in the area. Would highly recommend!
At this point it is possible to be more specific about what a “formal property” is. I take formal properties to be mathematical properties, essentially. For what it’s worth, I even think that this may not be far from Plato’s actual theory, reflecting as it does the metaphysical influence of Pythagoras and Parmenides. To say that a thing has a formal property is to say that there is an aspect or part of that thing that can only be described in terms of mathematical or logical relationships that can be formalized without reference to the contingent physical properties of the thing. For example the property of circularity is a formal property. The set of circular things includes wooden things, clay things, bone things and metal things, but circularity is supervenient: its mathematical description is about the spatial relationship between one of its parts and another and this formalizable (mathematical) relationship does not “reduce” to any contingent properties of wood cells or clay particles etc. That is, “formal properties” are properties that can be formalized. All formal properties are supervenient on matter: there is no physical criterion that fixes the extension of the set of physical things that instantiate the property.

Alright so our story begins in 1991 when the first Mother game was supposed to grace our Nintendo Entertainment Systems. Fans were riled up and itching to purchase their copies of this amazing Japanese master piece. So why did Nintendo choose not to release the game?

And finally, I watched them even out, and turn back into people I could recognize. What did I think? That a little time in "civilized society" was all that was necessary? That if we could just get them to "Point B" after they came home without hurting themselves or someone else, then we could lay it all down and be done with it?
Once I completed the first couple of obstacles it was all downhill from there. Literally downhill. And then back uphill, and back down. I would run as much as I could on the uphill, walk with long strides the rest, and then I would gingerly run the downhill...usually sideways.

The anonymity of the referees must be preserved. There’s no other way that people will submit frank and candid feedback. But anonymity can also lead to abuse and flame wars, usually “won” by those with the most time on their hands, as happens again and again in online comment sections. There must be an editor or moderator in between who chooses or at least approves the referees, knows their identities and does not allow Gawker-style comments from the peanut gallery.

My dear husband celebrated his birthday on Friday. I arranged for a babysitter so that we could have the evening to ourselves, a rarity! We thought about going to a movie, another rarity, but nothing was playing that caught our attention. So we decided on dinner at one of our favorite restaurants Truluck’s at the Arboretum. We made reservations but arrived earlier than expected and decided to have drinks in their bar area. Well, we loved the casual feel of the bar area so much that we decided to eat our dinner there too. There was a gentleman playing the piano and he was amazing. I would have made a request, but he played all my favorites without even asking! I wish I could share pictures of all the gorgeous and delicious food, but I didn’t pull my phone out once. I have a good excuse. No. Not really. Unless you call having a wonderful time talking, drinking and eating that you forget to document the deliciousness of it all. Actually I’ll blame the pomegranate martinis. Oh and I did say martinis.

So why didn't that happen? Maybe a custodial sentence was the only option open. I doubt it, but if it was, it should not have been and in any case it didn't need to be so long. Why sixteen months? Well, given that similar and worse crimes routinely attract shorter, even suspended, sentences, it is hard not to reach the conclusion that Charlie is being made an example of or even that he is somehow being used as a proxy punishment for the wishy-washy liberalism and /or wealth of those close to him. David Gilmour has been a staunch supporter of Gary McKinnon, the autistic computer hacker whose extradition Uncle Sam has sought for several years, and has been ready to criticise the establishment over the years, directly or by implication. And of course, he is loaded.
Creator David Shore and Hugh Laurie appear to have made this call themselves. They probably recognize that they aren’t really getting what they used to got out of the show, and the network is comparing falling ratings to increased productions costs. Fortunately they’ve made this decision early. Perhaps giving the show an endpoint will allow the writers to write towards some sort of conclusion. Right now it feels like everyone is treading water. Perhaps having a direction and purpose will finally breathe some life into this season. I hope so, because I don’t want to remember this show based on the quality of this season.

These were a couple of my pages done for Marylinn Kelly's Sunset journal in the original True Colors project. They weren't shown in the book, which I always thought was kinda sad, as they were among my very favorites. I washed the pages with the prettiest golden color seen in my mind's eye. The section of the page on the left is a little booklet I printed and stitched together of poems from various places, mentioning sunset but about humanity, layered over some very very old handprinted
When the color is how you want it to be, bust out the brush and paint the tea onto the wood. If you added the steel wool, you can also use that as your brush, but I'd recommend putting on gloves first. The stain will absorb pretty quickly and you probably won't need to wipe off any excess. (I didn't.) You can apply more than one coat.

NAMA gave itself a target of paying down 25% of its debt by the end of 2013 in its business plan published in June 2010. There seems to be some suggestion that this target made it into the IMF memorandum of understanding, thereby copper-fastening it as a commitment, but I cannot see this as a term of the agreement with our bailout friends which presumably means that the target can be amended by NAMA without seeking permission from the IMF or indeed the Government.

I had to call my mom, call Chip's mom, talk with Chip, and pray really hard to figure out how to handle this situation. You see, Alli made a mistake and got suspended last week. (We're going to appeal the decision, as we think it was just a vindictive punishment from the principal... more on that later). Everyone had wise counsel and advice. It's nice to have smart parents :D. But I think the best advice my mom gave was "Use this as a learning experience, try For the Strength of Youth"... (For the Strength of Youth is a pamphlet my church gives out to youth 12-18- although it's completely appropriate for anyone of all ages..... it also makes for some good parenting guidelines.- if you are curious to see what my church's standards are- I invite you to click this link).
Late on Monday evening the outcome of the SFA Judicial Panel hearing into allegations against Craig Whyte and Rangers was made public. It is fair to say that the sentences passed, if not the verdicts, were surprising. The immediate response from the administrators of Rangers was to condemn the “draconian sanctions”. On the other hand, commentators and fans of teams other than Rangers expressed surprise at the severity of the penalties. There had been a widespread view that a rap on the knuckles would be delivered. However, what landed on Rangers was the equivalent of a Joe Frazier hook to the head.

On a side note, in case you're wondering, Danzig is full on bummed about the books and it appears Rollins doesn't really care for them either, but Rollins takes a more neutral response and Danzig's seem to be from a more homophobic tone.

As such, it is important for CIOs to have succession planning in order that the business has continuity in the unfortunate event of a CIO not being able to provide management.

While I love engaging with others — and I’m sure God is with us, two or three gathered together, in discussion, communal prayer, and singing — I really need silence and solitude to really find myself centered in God, to pray most honestly, to be able to listen to God. Sometimes this solitude actually comes in the midst of a group of people, but I need to take time alone as well, or I find myself adrift and untethered from God.

10. Not accepting lists of symptoms or timelines from patients. If you see patients, you know they range on a continuum from poor historians who have no idea why they are there to see you and those who arrive with carefully constructed histories that they are eager to give you as soon as you walk in. Just about the worst thing you can do when this happens is to tell the patient that you don’t want the list and do not even want to look at it. That connotes a dismissive attitude to the patient and it makes them feel like all of their work was for nothing – work that was done in the hopes it would help you figure out what was wrong. You may have very good reason at the time not to look at the list such as time pressure, but at least take the list and say you will later take a look at it. It will likely provide you some useful information.

And Cosmo, my friend and mathematician,
There is no doubting the statistical correlation between oil prices and the loonie. Econometric analysis indicates that since the turn of the century, oil prices explain 86 per cent of the dollar’s rise. The precise reasons for this correlation are unclear. It certainly is not due to a strong trade balance. In fact, Canada has experienced a deepening international payments deficit in recent years, because non-petroleum exports are falling faster than our energy exports surge (see graph). My own research suggests it is foreign takeovers of petroleum companies and reserves, not current production and export of the stuff, that is driving the loonie up. It is equally clear that the Canadian dollar is overvalued, relative to both historical averages and economic fundamentals. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the current “fair value” for the Canadian dollar (based on purchasing power parity analysis) is about 81 cents U.S. Anything higher and Canadian-made products and services look disproportionately expensive (including manufacturing, services, tourism — and even Big Macs, according to the Economist’s famous hamburger index).

City Island is at the north end of the Bronx in New York City.

It's beautiful and at night, it's magical. It's a very popular place for dates because the atmosphere can be so romantic.
On Sunday morning, July 25, 1841, at a Nassau Street boarding house owned by her mother, Rogers told one of the boarders, her finacee Daniel Payne, that she was going out for the afternoon to visit her sister, a Mrs. Downing. That night, New York was hit by a severe thunderstorm, and Rogers did not return to the boarding house. Both her mother and Payne figured that because of the storm, Rogers was spending the night at her sister’s house. Yet the next day, Rogers’ sister told them that Rogers had never shown up at all, nor had she expected her to visit. Joined by Roger’s ex-finacee, Alfred Crommelin, they searched the city, but could not find any trace of Rogers. Unfortunately, this was not the first time that Rogers had disappeared. In October 1838, Rogers’ whereabouts were unknown for several days. When she returned, she said she had visited a friend in Brooklyn, even though she had not told her mother, or her employers of her intentions.

The aspect of ‘ties’ is currently being explored given the explosion that has occurred in social networking (Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe, 2007). These ties, or bonds, are classified as both weak and strong and their distinction is the degree of emotion and other intimate dimensions that occur in strong ties, challenging the relations to be solidified regardless of goals (Ellison et al., 2007, p. 1). Fascinating topic and I trust we will explore even more. Any idea in accelerating innovation given these premises?

I am left-handed, and I am irrationally proud of it. Maybe because my mother, who greatly admired Leonardo Da Vinci, was thrilled when I started drawing with my left hand and later, when I was four, writing from right to left, ´mirror writing´ certain letters; she never once thought of encouraging me to use my right hand instead. And well until my school years I would occasionally use the mirror form of a letter – certain letters just seemed ok both ways – and I can still write from right to left quite effortlessly.

When I joined the wine trade, well over twenty years ago, Alsace was the first classic region whose wines seduced me.

The second area of courage that I believe is lacking among some Black men involves the ability to think differently about women. As I suggested above, not being about to think differently about women has led many of us to think that women can be viewed as sexual objects, instead of objects of our genuine affection. The thinking behind the development of this opinion can be located, I think, in the conversations that many men have with their uncles and fellow young men. Personally, I do not know many, or any fathers that give their sons this kind of advice. This possibility is due in large part to the absence of fathers in the lives of young Black boys and men. I believe that the perpetual paucity of Black fathers in the lives of young Black boys creates a void in the hearts of young Black men about the proper way to think about and see the beauty of a woman. Hence, the ability of many men to do the third, and final component of courage: acting differently.

I’m not superstitious but we had a pretty hefty share of bad luck before we managed to pick up the car.

So, here's what they told me. I use a lot of "expense items" as shortcuts to include information on client checks, i.e., I created items for things and entered descriptions, so that the descriptions appear on the checks. An example might be "Bank Charge" as an item and the description might be "Bank Service Charge." Well, apparently the QuickBooks wizard doesn't see "through" those items to the underlying accounts. Had I used the account for Bank Charges under the Expenses tab, rather than an item on the Items tab, it would have worked fine. But it does not. However, I was reassured that my 1099s would print correctly because the 1099 Detail Report was correct. And I was assured they would send this whole mess off to the developers to address in a future release.

I apologize for this late review of a movie that I’ve been meaning to get to for a while. After a bunch of chaos with my health and moving into a new place, I didn’t really have time to do a write-up for Wrath of the Titans, the sequel to 2010′s remake of Clash of the Titans. Now however, I’ve found some time to offer my two cents on the movie for those who are still curious, though unfortunately, since I had to wait such a long while to see the movie, the IMAX 3D cut was bumped out of my home city, and I had to see the movie in plain old digital 3D. Still, I suppose there are worse things. So, anyway, if you don’t recall, the Clash of the Titans remake from a couple of years ago was panned by critics and mostly detested by the moviegoing community. The movie was heavily criticized as being a mindless effects spectacle with absolutely no substance to speak of, featuring bland characters, an astonishing lack of depth and no real lasting impression. If you read my review of Clash though… you’ll recall that I actually didn’t hate it. Yes, I also commented that the movie amounted to dumb action with little reasoning and the depth level of a kiddie pool, but still, I didn’t hate the movie, and my rebuttal to the many people that did; What did you expect? Did you look at that thrash metal-laden action montage that Warner Bros. called a trailer, and think that you were in for the most elegantly complex Greek epic this side of Immortals? Yeah, the Clash remake may have been a much dumber rendition of the same story from the original 1981 film, but I think it was also a victim of misplaced expectations on the part of much of the audience. I saw the movie in 3D with a friend on opening night, and we both agreed that, while it was dumb as toast, it was still fun and we didn’t regret going. Actually, that’s another reason why I think so many people detested the Clash remake; Warner Bros. decided at the ABSOLUTE last second, as in, a couple of the weeks before the movie was released, that it was going to be delayed an extra week to add a post-3D conversion on top of it. Yeah, you can imagine how well that went. About a week spent on a 3D job, and as expected, it was atrocious. The Clash remake still bears the distinction to me, with the only other possible contenders being The Last Airbender, My Soul to Take and Conan the Barbarian, of having the most horrendous 3D job I have ever seen. It was dreadful! That much may be true, but several people I know at least, who initially trashed the movie, have since cooled down on it, and after re-watching it, they conceded that they were too hard on it the first time, admitting that it was yet another knee-jerk reaction exacerbated by the godawful 3D presentation. Still, Clash 2010 was really not well-liked, but I don’t think it really deserves to be called a terrible movie, because, yes, it’s really dumb and cheesy, but I’ve seen FAR worse in the fantasy genre, that’s for sure! Despite the hatred though, Clash did well enough at the box office to get a sequel, Wrath of the Titans, and Wrath brings back most of the recognizable cast (with Andromeda being the only major role recast), having a grittier presentation, and a title that actually makes sense now, since titans are FINALLY featured in the plot! A few new Greek mythology beasties also show up as well, including the Chimera, the Minotaur and some giant Cyclops beasts, but all in all, Wrath amounts to the same kind of stupid, hollow fun as its predecessor, only grungier and grittier. As far as it stacks up with the original, I find that Wrath does improve the quality of the spectacle and definitely the 3D presentation, so visually, it tops its predecessor, but in terms of everything else, Wrath feels even more empty and unmemorable. It’s a movie that feels surprisingly tiny in all of its would-be grand-ness, and it’s missing that extra something that creates a truly riveting and epic blockbuster. If you liked the Clash remake, or just enjoy some halfway decent effects porn, hold the depth every now and again, Wrath is good enough to check out as a light watch to scratch your effects itch before the Summer movie season really gets going, but if you’re looking for any kind of lasting impression or sense of character, Wrath forgot to pack it, so you’ll probably want to look elsewhere.

81. We Need to Talk About Kevin - Lionel Shriver
I can count on one hand the number of serious relationships I’ve been in (which is probably sad given that I am 30). I don’t find it easy to trust and I usually fall for the wrong people. That said, I am proud to say I’ve never been someone who HAD to be in a relationship to be complete. I had friends in high school/college who just went from guy to guy and never took time to know themselves. I was the opposite. I was never boy crazy – I never had pressure from my family to “settle down”. It’s interesting to me when my friends parents were obsessing over prom dates and “love” – my parents were focused on my academic accomplishments and my passions (journalism, music shows etc). They never pushed me to date or “find someone” (and I love them for that!). Even at 30 I have never once gotten the “You need to settle down” speech. They love that I have a job I’m happy with and I respect myself. I’m sure deep down they hope I find someone and have kids, but I know if I didn’t – they would love me just the same.
But ignoring the lexical turn-off, my wife makes great homemade yogurt. Lowfat. No added preservatives and questionable ingredients. It’s a delicious, healthy breakfast food, whether alone or with fruit and/or granola. It adds a nice touch to a fruit salad lunch.
Serious. Yeah. That's the other thing: this is something that is being taken completely cold-dead serious. For as corny and dumb as Meteor is, not one moment of self-referential humor can be found of any kind. If this was made today, you can be sure that there would be stupid, goofy, overblown comedic scenes by the truckload.
Your not wanting to be bothered
This is the eighth (that’s right) eighth collaboration with Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton. This time based on the soap opera that ran from 1966-1971 on daytime television. The story tells of a man named Barnabas Collins (Depp) who has been cursed by a witch and turned into a vampire only to be buried alive for 200 years. Collins arises in the 1970s to a world of disco and Chevrolet cars. This is typical Burton territory, gothic oddball stories with comedy and Depp incorporated. I for one have grown a bit tired of Depp doing his same old schtick ever since playing Captain Jack Sparrow. The voice, the oddities and mannerisms seem too similar for most of the recent parts he has played. I for one think I can pass on this silly looking film as I think Burton has lost some of his creative charm as of late. The 2010 film Alice in Wonderland was quite a disappointment, substituting wild and crazy effects in place of a good story.

Jachelle: Any of the scenes at the wall. Those were the only parts of the episode when I found my attention wandering a bit. Although, yes, Sam is amazingly adorable and I just want to snuggle him all the time. But back to the topic at hand, to be honest, I’m not even entirely sure what was going on there. There were some people they were watching? They sent some Rangers (and Jon) to go scout them? I really am not even sure. Ah, well. I’ll figure it out later, right? Right. Moving on.
I think the most healthy answer to cleanse the body, jump start the metabolism, and rid yourself of the toxins and overeating that you’ve possibly been doing in recent months is to combine both. Here is what I propose:
They weren’t wrong to want the best for their citizens, they were just wrong for not understanding the basic math to understanding whether or not that was a legitimately sustainable option. If the governments can’t figure out how to measure sustainability, it’s not likely that the recipients of such generosity will understand the economics of what’s causing them to lose their not so hard-earned benefits.

Jules is mega-busy right now, so it was great to see her call by during the week. I swiftly hid the ruined pogo stick and the trail of duck weed in case Jules gets to think we've become a bit unruly. But, despite being so busy, just look here at the card Jules brought with her! Wow, how stunning huh?! It blew me away - I love the lace frou frou skirt especially - and, as always, Jules has come up with a really gorgeous card. If you haven't already seen it, or even if you have, I recommend a visit!
I like the idea of having 3 separate bins so we can have a pile that's ready, one that's working and one that we're adding to. Right now we have an ugly little pile of leaves, weeds, apple peelings, and coffee grounds (I'll spare you a picture of that. You should thank me.). So, building this little baby is one of our goals for next spring.﻿﻿ One way that we can work on the pile over winter is to save our scraps and continue to add to it.

This is a prime example of why I like doing these themed months; without spending the month purposely looking for holiday films to watch I wouldn’t bother with a film starring Jim Carrey and made with performance capture, especially when there are other versions of this story that I wanted to see more. (Like Scrooged. How I managed to go all this time without seeing Scrooged is beyond me, but it’s an oversight that’s since been corrected. Expect it to be the next film reviewed.) But because I’m on the lookout for holiday movies this month and because it was streaming on Netflix I’ve found a great film to add to the holiday rotation. DISNEY’S adaptation strikes the perfect balance between being a kid’s movie and an adult’s movie, and Robert Zemeckis has wrung seemingly every bit of humor, fright, and action possible out of this story.
For those of you who don’t comprehend the severity of this situation, let me explain…

Tove Jansson's love of nature, the sea, boats, landfalls and the offshore islands of her native land permeate these books. That's one of the reasons they work for grown-ups, too. But the main reason they work for me, I think, is that I just know that if I were to turn up in Moomin Valley one sunny April day, Moominmamma would put another leaf-plate on the table and tell me to sit down. I could find my own place in that extended family, which might include spending whole days or weeks alone but knowing there'd be a big velvety cuddle waiting for me when I needed it.

Lesson 6
(Nicholas County)- No member of the clergy is allowed to tell jokes or humorous stories from the pulpit during a church service.
Innominus awoke from his trance state, and collapsed to the floor, filled with the spirit of Endra. A few minutes later, as he came back to his everyday senses, the cleric relayed what he had seen to his companions. He also noted that the content of his vision -- Kaminster's country manor being overwhelmed by a vile undead horde -- felt as if it were imminent, maybe already happening, maybe just about to occur.
I cut out two of the dolls and pasted them on cardboard, as well as a sentiment I created in MS Word. I used an adhesive fabric paper for background and layered the cut-outs onto a card. Then I gussied them all up with fussy stuff. And this is what I got.

In round one of the “Bounty Gate” scandal, the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell handed down some hefty fines and suspensions to the organization and it’s coaching staff, led by GM Mickey Loomis and Head Coach Sean Payton. Loomis was suspended for the first 6 games of the 2012 season, and Payton was suspended for the entire upcoming 2012 season. Lack of parody there? You decide…

Toasted walnuts and sunflower seeds
It makes some sense, I suppose, that I would think that. Our society tends to separate the painter and the mathematician, as if one could not be talented at both things. In addition to this, it was common among my friends in gifted to scorn those whose abilities waxed more creative. When someone would say something stupid, or generally appear to us to be lacking in intellectual ability, we’d surmise that they must be ‘creative gifted.’ Which essentially meant stupid.

I can admire that kind of dominance, but I wonder at the implications. I did not think much of Oregon’s skill players outside of LaMichael James and maybe Kenjon Barner, but this was a faceless wheel of destruction that required faceless cogs and sprockets to run the machine, and not Home Depot cogs and sprockets because this is a recession after all but literally stuff cobbled together out of wire and twist ties and pen caps, the kind of material you expected the federal government to use to build houses post-Katrina. The realization that this offense was different from the triple option, the Fun ‘n Gun, the spread, etc. was surreal at times. Those offenses were prolific, but they did not change the fundamental principles of football: time of possession meant something, and if you could hold the ball long enough you’d have a chance. Oregon is first in the nation in scoring and something like 115th in time of possession. Let that sink in for a bit.
The reason for head brewer Kees Bubberman & co to make the trip from their base in Kamperland all the way to the Marble Arch was simple: beer. They’re here to brew some collaboration beers with the Marble brewery. The most interesting of which promises to be Earl Grey IPA. And yes, it is brewed using Earl Grey tea.
With only this and Black Devil Doll From Hell to his (dis)credit, Chester Novell Turner has created something of a legend that it took Uwe Boll, Edward D. Wood Jr. and Ted V.

As probably most authors do who self-publish, I downloaded a copy of my book to my e-reader. As I began to read, though, I started to notice little issues. I started to notice the missing word here or there, the spelling problems, the grammar issues.
He gets over her death rather quickly. So he watches his wife get stabbed to death in front of him and keeps his cool, but DG gets put in “the box” for a couple minutes and reverts to a Cro-Magnon. I forgot to mention that Mr. Gage’s character has a gimp leg and uses a cane to hobble with. He’s able to stop the killer by pushing him down, which gives them enough time to get in the truck and get away. Then for some reason the guy from That Thing You Do gets killed, along with his girlfriend. This scene is completely superfluous and only serves as a reason to try to make the killer scary. They do not succeed.
Mommy: No peanut, Mommy has never seen a blue dog before either.
I wrote a few poems about the white deer, verses that didn’t make it into Poems from the Battlefield. The white deer poems didn’t match the tone of the book–the series seemed more about the miracle of the creatures than the history of their habitat. I could have edited the poems, but I didn’t want to ruin the uniqueness of the experience as expressed in the original pieces. There may yet be a place for the unedited white deer poems, but for now, this is the place. Enjoy.
Before I left work, I asked my friends not to make a big fuss about it. So last Thursday, we decided to go to the cinema to watch The Avengers Assemble and then perhaps going someplace to eat afterwards.

TAKE YOUR TIME!! make as many as you'd like, or just "stitch the ditch" around the squares. when i was finished, some of the basting stitches from earlier were visible, so i just removed them with my seam ripper.

Now he has the bed all covered with the clothes he's taking. Hope I don't accidentally knock them to the floor.

I picked this up on a whim at the thrift shop (99¢), based mostly on the cover photo (and its great condition). I don't think of Merv Griffin as especially knowledgeable about the British Music Hall, and I picture him meeting Arthur Treacher at a party, and the two of them deciding to make this LP on a lark. During my formative years, there were apparently 800 Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips franchises in the US, though I just heard about it today.
If secular liberals can give up some of their snootiness, and if evangelicals can retire some of their sanctimony, then we all might succeed together in making greater progress against common enemies of humanity, like illiteracy, human trafficking and maternal mortality.
Cut bacon into small dice. Place in a large pot (cast iron dutch oven is traditional, I didn't use my tonight though) and cook until almost crispy. Meanwhile chop one onion into a small dice. Add it to the bacon and cook on a medium low heat until the onion is very translucent. Do not rush this step. When onions are translucent, add minced garlic. Then put in your anaheim chili and ancho chili (or any chilies you want, really.)

After night has come, most of us sleep and dream. I've heard some people say that they don't have dreams. According to research, we all do dream and dreaming is essential for good mental health. Research tells us that on the average humans spend six years of their lives dreaming. Even animals dream according to scientific studies. Those who say they do not dream probably just don't remember their dreams or recognize that they are dreaming.

It’s understandable. After I finished writing my manuscript, SHAKEN NOT STIRRED…A CHEMO COCKTAIL, I decided to take off this spring and summer, from my tennis addiction, to focus on editing and publishing my book. (And promoting The SCAR Project coming to Cincinnati this fall, which has been crazy busy fun.) So that’s why my tennis girlfriends were being so ridiculous, acting like we were meeting for the first time, and as if the wine bottles were house warming gifts, instead of a case of catching up.

I think the Victorian aspect and also cinematography in general are nice. In terms of how bad... In my opinion the acting is truly terrible, the story is unoriginal, and it's quite cheesy too.... But hey it wasn't so bad that I ran out (although I did sneak out for an extended ice-cream break) Scott is a huge John Cusack fan and I write a neo-Victorian blog, so despite the bad reviews and general misgivings we settled in for 111 minutes of an Edgar Allan Poe-inspired horror film.

I am not sure that will happen, but I am sure what will happen if I go beyond the 2 pounds, so I will try. I also realize that I have finally come home, to where I belong, to whom I belong, and it is such a good, safe place. I feel more relaxed, more ready to face this busy month, more like "me".

Despite the solid direction, getting the rewards of the concluding insanity is dull going. At 110 minutes there should have been a lot more than six bizarre murders, and the bland young victims don't even die interestingly. Somewhere under the clutter there's a solid flick, but only genre connoisseurs will be able to take away in their memory the film they wanted. Happily, the killer does sing "Happy Birthday To Me" at the end, and on that level it's a success. Snickering hipsters who can't even get past the title should kindly take their seven bucks over to the Silent Movie Theater in West Hollywood, where that won't even get them in the door.

Forgiveness, like love, is not just a feeling. It is a conscious choice and an definite action. You have to make the choice to forgive, and keep working at the forgiveness. This is especially true when the person you are working to forgive is still trying to hurt you. Keep working at it anyway, for yourself, and your family. Forgive as many times as you need to forgive. Ask God for help. Forgiving does not condone the behavior, words, or actions, of the one who hurt you, but it frees you from needing to hold onto your hurts. Freedom is an excellent feeling, and place to be.
Rabinowitz testified that Miss Cole had just returned from a road tour with Muddy Waters' band. He concluded that she had been singing the song while on tour, and that Muddy Waters had liked it and recorded it, claiming authorship for himself.

The hallway widened and her footsteps made a peculiar ringing sound with every step. Brushing away some loose sand with her foot, she saw that the floor was carved of natural rock salt to resemble tiles. Soon the corridor opened up into a large circular chamber with a high-domed ceiling of sandstone. A dozen equally spaced doorways led into the room, but the most striking feature was the enormous statue of an armed warrior taking up the center of the room.
But I left my record shop job 2 & 1/2 years ago. The skateboard side had been sold off a couple of years prior to that. My wife also changed jobs and no longer does the tennis.

I have no trousers that aren't fraying at the turnup.

So, 10 min before we left for church this morning, my son walked in with an open bottle of rubbing alcohol saying "yuck!". After a panicked call to poison control, we found he probably didn't drink much because it's nasty and would have already have caused vomiting. We had to bathe him because it can be absorbed through the skin, and keep him within eyesight for the next 2 hours to watch for signs of drunkenness. Thankfully he seems to be ok.

The writer isn’t talking about being candid like in photography, where the subject doesn’t know its picture is being taken. So just like that, we have to hide our faults and sins. The other person doesn’t need to know that part about us.
here should also be concern at the capacity of South Africa’s intelligence services to accurately detect and act against such a threat. There is some evidence to suggest that the efforts of these agencies have been turned inwards to fight domestic political battles for factions within the ANC. They may not have their eye on the ball internationally to the extent that they should. Evidence led in the current Jackie Selebi trial also suggests that these agencies have been corrupted.

Obama has never said he wants to change America into a European-style country — though, when we look at greatly reduced heart disease rates in every nation of Europe, or when we look at mass transit in France, Germany and England, we might see places we could do better.
With the start of the European season following the National championships period, Demus would take a break til late July, but that didn’t take away from the action as Paris would see Hejnova crank out a huge 53.29 NR to win over the likes of Spencer (53.45), Natalya Antyukh (RUS, 54.41) and Walker (55.06). Demus would get in another race in Luzerne winning in 54.21. Then Stockholm would see Spencer take a 53.74 to 54.71 win over Walker, before hammering a huge PR 52.79 in London over Walker (53.90) and Hejnova (54.74) to head to Daegu with the best time in the world.
The first goal was to bring the deeply divided district in a deeply divided city together to focus on children. Even in the few truly diverse neighborhoods in the city, like ours in Grant Park, the district’s longstanding school choice program let more privileged parents off the hook from focusing on their neighborhood schools because they could transfer them and drive them to the more prestigious schools in more affluent neighborhoods. School choice wasn’t about educational options… it was about “the good schools” that I want for my child and “the bad schools” that are not good enough for my child, but are just fine for those other children.
So, great move by not getting into NFLX early, watching and waiting paid off. It dropped and now today is still in themid 90's, I will continue to watch it around the 100 though. It should be a nice mover if it gets past it and stays.

Ironically, the deciding factor for us was finding out that Finn has Down syndrome. Because he has Down syndrome, he (supposedly) already has a “compromised” immune system. This fact alone seems to spur a lot of parents to definitely go forward with vaccines. It made me even more gun-shy of getting him immunized. In my mind, I couldn’t help but remember that my pediatrician has always wanted to delay vaccines if one of my children were sick when they were due for vaccines, exactly because it wasn’t a good idea to put toxins into the bodies of children whose immune systems were compromised by illness. Seven months after Finn was born, my husband was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer, and throughout his treatment, our kids could not receive live-virus vaccines because Michael’s indirect exposure could prove very dangerous to him while his immune system was compromised by chemo. That said a lot to me, too. Vaccines are not entirely benign; they can be dangerous.
My first step was doing a wash over the entire jute area in the color I selected as my base. I took some ASCP in Olive and added a dash of Antibes just for fun, and watered it down so that it would almost pour off my brush and into the cracks of the super textured jute, rather than "glob" on, like with typical paint viscosity. (A huge thanks to Dana at Shabby Chic Addiction for brainstorming this out with me and suggesting I use a wash when I said I was going to use a roller. That would have been a nightmare with jute. Dana, you rock!) You can see by the picture below that I wasn't worried about it being too perfect. I knew the Marakesh stencil I selected would only reveal a small amount of the olive, so I didn't bother with two coats.

The U.S. Government is out of control. The U.S. Government, AKA "Uncle Sam" or the "Rogue Highwayman," is now robbing random citizens, who stumble on its broad pothole riddled bureaucratic boulevard. That once beautiful boulevard was known as Constitution Avenue. It has now become a dangerous and rundown toll road.
According to Weil, treatments that elicit negative emotional charges can be result in benefits when the treatment “mobilizes attention and belief.” In other words, adhering to urine therapy in spite of one’s loathing for it increases its placebo effect.

On the Ninja School blog, journalists will document their training and their use of the skills on the job. To complete additional levels, you need to document that you are still using the skills from previous belts.
I bought a juicy hunk of corn on the cob from a street stand and for the first time managed to ask for it in Chinese without soliciting nothing but a puzzled expression.
With doctors continually denying risks and not being aware of current studies how can they properly inform parents of the benefits and risks when they are so biased, uneducated and opinionated on the subject. With that in mind we come to the signed papers. I have not found anywhere that it states what is to be written on that document. It would be nice to assume that it will say something like, risk/benefits were explained and medical intervention was denied. In reality it could be very different. Doctors could write that risk/benefits were explained and parent refuses, putting child and community in danger. Then the parent is required to sign a paper showing that they basically agree to the doctor’s paper. If a parent is being required to sign such a thing…… no wonder there is backlash about this.

Nevertheless, it was another good baking experience for me...at least now I know, the petals that were lined on the base of the tube pan would remained intact, they were not buried or covered by the batter. Without using any special tools or taking extra care, I didn't even rid them off while I was unmoulding the cake from the pan. Till now, I still find this rather amazing!

Fully clothed and glaring, he continued to pee while I continued to feed his sister while saying things like “Are you peeing?!” and “Oh my god, you are peeing!” and “Oh my god”. And the puddle grew and spread and I sat on the couch and did nothing and he stood there and glared at me.
Over the course of time, The Nugget's needs have changed. There have been periods, though brief, that she has not wanted to be rocked. I haven't liked it, but I have respected her decisions even from only a few months old on this matter. As time has gone on, she counts on being rocked as much as I count on rocking her. Unlike some children, she is not usually difficult to rock to sleep. She relaxes, snuggles, listens to her songs, lets the day wash away and sleeps.
It’s so important to have a strong support system through all stages of your life. You’ll need it if you go through something like this. I want to help people who have been blessed enough to never see this happen in their own relationship, better understand and be able to help the friends and family that might have this happen to get through it in a more positive way. Bottom line is that not all of us have been there. I want to give insight to those people who don’t know what to do or say to their loved one, and show them that they can be that support system your friend will so desperately need.
This book was unlike any other Stephen King book I've read. The first few chapters build the case for going back into the past and once Jake gets there I was hooked. The story of his life in the Land of Ago made me smile, it made me cry, and it left me on the edge of my seat wanting more. The book is so descriptive that I felt like I was there in 1958 with him.
This one anime is more of a comedic anime. I don’t think people are really informed of this one. But, like I said, I am outside of Japan so I am not really sure.

When I got home, I turned on Julie & Julia on with the French voice-overs so I could practice French and get in the mood, but I soon shut it off when I realized there was browning and simmering, there was putting things in the pot and taking things out of the pot to put them in again later. There were too many instructions for what was once:

I’ve received upwards of fifty stories so far, by the way, ranging from quite readable to stunningly good, and it’s going to take some hard work to winnow the selection down to the 12 or 14 stories that will go into the anthology. Many thanks to all for your submissions, and I hope that even those of you whose stories aren’t selected gain something from the experience.

I sincerely believe all readers can become fans of classic novels if allowed the opportunity to dip briefly into several different titles until they find the one that ensnares them in a story they can’t abandon.
The first exercise is the concentration on the present moment. As Hadot noted in his old age, this approach has much in common with Buddhism, and there is some reason to believe that Buddhism could have been a distant influence on Ancient Greek philosophy, particularly on that of Plotinus, if in an indirect form via contact with Persia, particularly after Alexander’s conquests. The Buddha, after all, was a rough contemporary of Socrates.
If everything works out as planned, I will be taking “The Kid” to see Bon Jovi in concert the next time they come through Dallas.

Although still early, the fall semester seemed to be moving along exceptionally well, there had been no grievous or life-threatening problems ... that is, until this particular afternoon ... there before the class stood a manifestly umbrageous Bartholomew Goodfellow, one hand grasping a long, thick willow switch with which he was methodically striking the wide palm of his other hand with loud, sinister smacks ... Bartholomew angrily announced that some despicable larcenist had committed an unpardonable act of outright villainy--some shifty-eyed culprit had pilfered his lunch and he was now demanding that the worthless vagabond be straightaway apprehended and brought to swift and sudden justice ... that being three stinging blows across the bare back from that willow switch ... no exceptions ... which he was menacingly waving through the air for all to behold ..... that which Mister Crabtree greatly feared had come to pass! ...
It all started when Tongs started to form in Chinatown. A Tong is the term used for a type of secret society found among Chinese American immigrants. Tongs started forming during the 1850’s during the California Gold Rush when many Chinese immigrants started flocking to the city they called “Gold Mountain.” They went to California thinking they were going to be able to make a fortune but many Chinese found themselves unwelcomed. Some were being robbed, and some were being taken advantaged of by the early settlers such as the Irish or Italians. They felt like they couldn’t go to the local law enforcement because a lot of the police were of Irish descent. The Chinese needed some sort of protection, the kind they had in their homeland, which led to the forming of Tongs. Tongs were created for mutual support and protection, especially from groups hostile towards the Chinese immigration. Industries and families formed their own Tongs and built meeting halls. Each Tong was a form of self government that looked after themselves. “If you were a shoemaker, there would be a shoemaker tong. If you were a seamstress, you would be in a seamstress tong.” There would also be tongs that were formed from last names. For example if a persons last name was Wong, they would be in the Wong tong. The Tongs were, and are today, a lifesaver to many hardworking immigrants.

Entry #58
Shit, I said, get in.
So today it almost hit 90 degrees out (it still could...it's only 3:30pm) so I've got summer on the brain. It's hot out there! My kids are already begging to go to the neighborhood pool (that's not even open yet) so I figured I better start looking for a swimsuit suit or two now! I haven't purchased a new swimsuit in about 4 years (besides the one I bought 2 years ago and it was the wrong size and I forgot to send it back within 30 days so now I'm stuck with it). It's time for some new options. Here are a few I've been looking at:
Since I've been back, I've been so busy that my nails have been naked for a few days! I managed to finally paint my nails last night with a Speciallita polish I recently received in a swap and I will post that as soon as I've posted these last few manis I did before I went on holiday!
And Matthew Walker adds:
On Friday there will be a new $$$$ wall unit delivered and set up where the TV and etc will be and actually is right now till the new unit comes. I have invited my youngest to supper and hopefully he will re-hook up the TV etc. I am bribing him with dinner. I have to spend the money but the last thing I am going to do is get a new larger and better TV. When I bought this We*tin*ho*se I had NO idea Consumer Report rated it like..below bottom. So I a stuck with one that really is a bad one. And I want a larger than this older 32 incher anyway. I wish I knew someone who wants it.
"How nicely you tell things," said the mice. The next night they came with four other mice to hear what the tree had to say. The more it talked, the more clearly it recalled things, and it thought, "Those were happy times. But they may still come back-they may come back again. Humpty-Dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married the Princess. Maybe the same thing will happen to me." It thought about a charming little birch tree that grew out in the woods. To the fir tree she was a real and lovely Princess.
My colourwork skills are mediocre at bed (I really don't enjoy it) and at the moment it looks a little like a Bruins egg - but I'm confident I can block it a little wider. I'm using a mix of Regia (black) and Baby Ull (Gold and White). Between Mom and I, we had the perfect colours in our stash. SCORE!
I would like to thank each and every one of you for your kind words and prayers on the passing of my mother. The funeral was hard for my Dad (he’ll be 99 in August) but he was doing pretty well on Thursday. The entire family felt surrounded and uplifted by your thoughts and prayers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
So now I just wait. Wait to feel back to normal, wait to get knocked up, wait to put this damn thing to use. Oh, and wait to shower. I am grosssssss right now.

The youngest of the family, her dowry was always going to be smaller. However, her high charisma soon had her known as the “Hot Sister”, to Zaav’s annoyance. Anne received the unfortunate circumstance of being related to Henry when he died. Due to the horrific and unexpected manner of his death, she was forced to take up the colours of mourning and keep out of society for several months, which equated to a virtual death sentence in this game. What little we saw of Anne earlier on painted her as a lovely, opinionated girl. She was utterly distraught with her brother’s duel, before and after, campaigning with what little influence she had for it to end, first off, and then not to be forced to sit through it. Sadly, she earned neither favour from her parents or her brother.

The procedural criticisms of the appointment process are far more serious, and raise fundamental questions about the legitimacy of global institutions in the post-colonial period. It was not surprising that Dr. Kim’s two opponents, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigera and José Antonio Ocampo of Colombia, openly expressed their disgust with the process, complaining that the most qualified candidate had not been chosen despite the institutional promise of a ‘merit-based’ selection process. Ms Okonjo-Iweala uttered a truism when she said that selecting the Bank president was not “open, transparent and merit-based.” Mr. Ocampo was even more direct, saying, “[Y]ou know this thing is not really being decided on merit.” In this fundamental respect, the supposed international search for a director was a charade. It became clear as other candidate were put forward by their respective governments that the decision would be made in Washington and that the person proposed would be, as in every instance, since the World Bank was established would be an American (just as every Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund has been a European. This is a quid pro quo never formalized but decreasingly legitimate given the new deWesternized geopolitical landscape that is becoming the most prominent reality of the early 21st century).

Even in the dusk, and the rain- I feel as I where just a ring. Ringing of a bell upon the highest mountain, and the ring that chimes in the wind lightly as the storm turns within. As the time shifts, and the ringing of me disappears-You are reminded, and recalled by your mind is perfect memory for the soul to keep even if I was just that ring- A ring that vibrates in the sunlight, and chimes in the dark, you can’t forget the notes that play upon the brain waves of yours- it is just a ring.
The kids have been great and seem to be aware of the build up Daddy is going through. They want my attention and energy but seem understanding when I am tired. It's the little things that make me appreciate how special it is to be doing what I am doing and having my family share in the experience. Even this morning with my daughter playing with making stop motion animations and helping her is such cool fun. Then my son doing his reading and the questions he has been asking makes me feel great as a Dad. Later we will head out and hang out at the park. Having a day off is so important and I guess refreshing in so many ways.

First band on, Murder are one of Denmark's brightest new hopes. The name might promise hardcore heavy metal, but the reality is somewhat different. The music that the critically-acclaimed duo produce is as surprising as their name- simultaneously sombre, uplifting, atmospheric and intense, Murder always produce something different. Similar in outlook to Tindersticks (who are apparently big fans) and Arab Strap, Jacob Bellens' characteristic voice is the focal point of a largely acoustic, 70s-inspired sound that invokes parallels with Nick Drake and late Johnny Cash. The music is sincere and straightforward, with equal parts Nordic melancholy and heart-warming Americana. Their astonishing live shows are regularly "Were you there?" moments that will be discussed for many years to come- with recommendations like that, it's worth your while checking them out…

Mustad’s Flashers Rigs are effective as they can be dropped directly below the boat where a lot of berley ends up landing. The flashers will catch fish without bait due to their flashy dressings and glow beads; however they really come into their own when a little bit of bait is used to spice them up. When rigging the flashers with bait, it is important not to overcrowd the gape of the hook. When rigging fish heads, it is best to simply slide the hook through the eyes and allow the bait to sit along the bend of the hook. Squid hoods (particularly Californian squid) can be rigged in a similar fashion, by pinning the hook through the tip of the hood once. The squid will sway seductively in any type of current, often proving too hard to resist for any hungry snapper. Small cubes of pilchards, the same size as berley cubes rigged on a flasher often produce the most fish. As the snapper are attracted to the immediate area by berley cubes it makes sense to drop the same sized bait down. By making sure that the gape of the hook is not overly filled with bait and ensuring there is plenty of hook exposure is the key. Remember that there is no need to cast the bait out long distances therefore the bait will remain in position during its descent to the bottom. The best part of using flashers is knowing that there is always a bait in the water. The saltwater fly like appearance ensures fish are always attracted to the rig even after the added bait has been picked away. Double hook-ups of snapper on the one rig are also not uncommon when schooling fish are in the area. The number of times the flasher rigs were the first to be hit during a session was quite astounding. Quite simply; they are fish catching machines.

This time, my aim was spot on, and the spider and towel fell almost gently together. On its way down, the towel hung itself on the air freshener plugged into the wall and draped its lower half into Jeremy's sink.

When Dr. Marten began producing footwear in the People's Republic of China I grimaced. It's pretty god damned hard to go through life without something that's not been made by those bloodsucking Communist bastards, but I was damned if any of my clothing or apparel would come from them! I've been wearing D.M's since 1989, having previously, derisively referred to them as "skinhead wear". All of the pairs I've owned were made in the U.K. My British made Dr. Marten's have outlasted most of my articles of clothing. I have a pair of oxblood six hole lace up Gibsons that are still soldiering on 19 years later and a black pair that have been going since I purchased them in Chicago during the very first Mod Chicago back in 2002. A few years ago I reluctantly purchased a pair of ten hole D.M. black boots, made in China. They are already falling apart, they've begun to crack in creases on the instep. Now I will have to add that I rather diligently care for my leather footwear, part of that comes from my strict upbringing that required a near military precision in caring for my Sunday best and of course that also comes from my modernist leanings (and military service where of course I had a massive leg up from both, especially the former). These boots of course got the same TLC that my British made D.M's did, but to no avail. Enter Joseph Babic, a smart man about town in the Big Apple who hipped me to a U.K. boot manufacturer who's been around for ages that made D.M. style footwear: William Lennon & Co.
And like space, the so-called final frontier, the idea of good and evil is also just an abstract built by the collective unconscious of the human existence.
One day, though, when Drew returns to the shop to in search of her mouse, who nibbled his way out of her backpack, she meets a mysterious character in back of the shop, near the dumpster. His name is Emmett Crane, and he's feeding her rat discarded cheese. She's both taken back and charged with excitement. Emmett knows rats as well as she does, and he actually talks to her. But she can't quite figure out why Emmett is so taken with the discarded cheese from the dumpster.
The entire film seems to have been written to display SRK at his best. He brings every nuance of the role to life and manages seemingly effortlessly to turn scenes from happy to sad to totally ridiculous and have us following along accepting every ridiculous turn of the plot.

Our annual NWJTT event will take place on Saturday 19th May. Competitors briefing at 10.30am, first race at 11.00am.
We are finally finished with transcripts, grants, soccer paper-trail, etc. Working on Cody's transcripts motivated me to be a little more organized with Austen. So..Sunday night I started putting Austen's transcript together. Oh my.
Due to the lungs, the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity of the human body are not the same. Therefore the lower body has a tendency to sink. If the body is not horizontal but even slightly inclined, the area it offers to drag is much higher, leading to higher resistance. An easy way to stay horizontal is to lean forward and position the head straight in the extension of the spine. In this position the eyes are directed straight downward and the head is more immersed (therefore total immersion).
I was thinking about the church. I was thinking about all those people and how many of them knew about Jesus. I was thinking that my experience in Pittsburgh was so unlike my experience in the church.
Elvis grins broadly and then reaches into his pocket. In his hand is something glistening and shiny. I can see the gold beneath the cracks in his fat fingers.
It was certainly not something either the London or Dublin governments, or their respective police forces, wanted to see surface in the days following the ambush, when all talk of possible collusion was dismissed out-of-hand by officials.
I cut some white card stock the exact height of the tin. I used a 12x12 piece of card stock to make sure it would wrap all the way around the tin.
Very top of the list is to NOT be in efficient efficiency place. Claustrophobia = ME, and I would probably end up killing husband, cats, or both if I had to co exist for too long in these “cozy” quarters.
Witness, however, the recent popularity of EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey (slide 19), a book with a seemingly nondescript cover, but one whose D/s-related sex scenes have the dominant discourse in a flutter about women—moms! wives!—publicly consuming an erotic text and taking pleasure therein. I would argue that part of what’s made this conversation possible, what’s made these open acts of reading acceptable, is Grey’s cover—even though many women are accessing the text via their Kindles, iPads, or other e-readers, thus making the book virtually invisible to passers-by. The nondescript nature of the cover—although there is a whisper of D/s, if you know it’s there—has made it socially acceptable for the book to be flashed on programs like Good Morning America and featured in The New York Times, Newsweek, and The Guardian: this may be an erotic romantic text, but it doesn’t look like one.
Once again this isn't glamorous, this isn't fun, this isn't cool. No one would think to grin and call this a great kill. This is pathetic, lonely, cruel and sad.
I’m not ready for that.
And so very fitting that our first appointment was on the 1st of the month. I had a normal sonogram, saline sonogram and a mock trial transfer. Everything went good. The Doc said everything looked perfect in there. Woohoo! Its been awhile since I’ve had my hoohaw on display, can’t say I’ve missed it. The trial transfer was really uncomfortable and I still have slight cramping 2 hours later. But they did a stomach sonogram for that and I did like that part. Made me day dream about actually having a baby in my stomach but I was quickly brought back to reality as the Doc stabbed my cervix with the damn catheter.
Thankfully, an intimate fish supper for four, with me as a starter, was not necessary as the dog’s owner finally showed up and called him off. Thoroughly shaken, in every way possible, I looked down at my arm to assess the damage. It was summer and the beach in question was in England, so of course I was wearing a long sleeved top and luckily this had taken the brunt of the damage.

The album starts out with a jittery little tune called “Down Down Down Down Down.” With Crepps’ urgent bass doing most of the work, Watson spins a tale of a man about to sink. “Well I had my first taste of whiskey/I had my first taste of love/Both got me high and twisted up inside/Only one way to go after up.”

Last night I visited with my therapist for the first time in several months. We talked and asked if she could be direct with me. I said I preferred it that way. I'm a no bullcrap kind of gal and I play life straight and to the punchline. Honesty to self, honesty to others is the best approach I find. Her questions really hit home but they were not unexpected nor were the answers. If anything, it was me sounding them out that really began to hit home. It is one thing to say these things to yourself but it is another to answer to someone else. The therapists I have had really never ever told me who I was and my current one hasn't, but she did throw back some thoughts and perspectives which really bore meaning and thought.
In the olden days, an assignment of this nature would be seen as being akin to Genghis Khan sending a trusted general to size up the next country he planned to conquer. Or Henry VIII sending a trusted confidant to check out the prospects of successfully hooking a new wife. But given that Rosmah’s name was also mentioned by PKR leaders when they divulged Shafee’s alleged assignment, it must be somewhere in between.
We went to a local diner for pancakes where we primarily stared at the baby in her car seat next to us, while Mike told me about all the comments he had left on Yahoo! articles. (I believe this is his new form of catharsis.)
Does anyone else have trouble getting that theme song stuck in their head for a full day after the show? It’s one of the few opening credits that is worth watching entirely every single week. It’s visually gorgeous and the music, oh the music. We are officially halfway through the season. How’s everyone doing? Curled up in a fetal position somewhere? Perfect.

Naturally, it would be better if this syllabus took me completely by surprise and introduced a whole slew of American Independents that I’ve never even heard of. But, y’know, we’ll see.
Yes, there are plenty of pubs and bars that have gone for a more modern image, but in general that has been accompanied by an overt appeal to the youth market, and they are often places to avoid unless you’re looking for a fight or a pull. So many times, a pub going “trendy” has been a precursor to a downhill spiral that ends in closure.

I've been painting the moon, as you can see above. My latest painting on canvas, aptly named 'March Moon'. I know that hares in March in folklore are supposed to act a little mad and of course gaze at the moon but this one is far too sleepy for that after having a busy day filled with the joys of spring.
But for someone coming to my work for the first time, the book I recommend is Template. It’s a stand-alone space opera, an Oliver-Twistish story about an odd fellow (all my protagonists are a little off the vertical) trying to find out who he is and why people are trying to kill him. It will give a first-timer a general introduction to The Ten Thousand Worlds and Old Earth, along with a rattling good read.
Alrighty then, on another note, I hope everyone enjoyed last week's challenge "Buttons and Bows" as much as we, on the DT, did! There was some amazing variety and I, personally, love challenges like that. They allow for a person's true creativity to come out. If you missed out on the projects posted by the DT and the participants you can check them all out HERE! Thank you to all our participants and to our lovely Guest Designer, An'Jenic of AJ Scrapbooking and Cards.
I think her work speaks for itself, however I found this quote to be an apt description of her work. In the November 23rd, 1939 Boston Herald an editorial stated: “Somehow she manages to bring dancing sunlight and vibrant atmosphere within the four walls and to soak her flowers in it."

May has always been my favourite month of the year. It’s an optimistic month – the anticipation that we might actually have a warm, pleasant summer; we can start considering outdoor events such as festivals, picnic’s and BBQ’s with last year’s washed-out disasters firmly put down in memory as ‘bad luck’ and we begin to consider all hues of cheery colours as possible wardrobe wearables. In general, there is just a less drab look about the place as we start opening windows and hanging laundry out on the mossy green washing line outside, enchanted by the smell of fabric conditioner in the open air.

On the placement front, Lukas Cetera is looking after sorting the Creative Internships out. So far he has passed my details onto 2 or 3 firms, and I am hoping to hear back within the next week (when I know, so will you!). He is also having to accommodate an animator, 2 or 3 architects/interior spatial designers, an artist and a journalist amongst others. Cross your fingers for me!!
“… for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.” – (Genesis 2: 5). Before the arrival of the new Adamic white race, the earth was watered by a mist that came up from the ground – (Genesis 2: 6).

In 1994, an article in PC Computing Magazine, written by John Dvorak, described a proposed bill in the U.S. Senate, titled SB040194, that would make it illegal to use the internet while drunk or to talk about sexual matters over a public network. The article further described how the Federal Bureau of Investigation would legally be able to tap the telephone of anyone who “uses or abuses alcohol” while accessing internet. Dvorak’s article goes further to say the bill will almost assuredly be passed since “no one wants to come out and support drunkenness and computer sex.” He offered the explanation for the origin of the bill: “The moniker “information highway” itself seems to be responsible for SB040194. Congress seems to think that being drunk on a highway, no matter what kind of highway it is, is bad.” The article generated so much response from outraged citizens that Senator Edward Kennedy, who had been named in the article as the bill’s sponsor, had to issue a press release denying the rumors.
For the photo shoot, the girls have to model silk gowns while covered in silkworms. Get it? China! The girls are also supposed to show “emotions” which apparently means “look like you’re about to cry.” No one has the expected freakout over the worms, and the photo shoot is generally unremarkable.

In 2006, when I was in Peru at the SpiritQuest lodge, don Howard talked with me about how Ayahuasca works with us in terms of visions, healing, and influence in our lives. He said something curious that when I first heard it, I wondered if it was true. He told me that the visions we receive may be powerful, fearful, wonderful, or they may not come at all. “They are important,” he said, “but the real work that Ayahuasca will do with you will occur later. About three months after you get home – that is when you should look for the real effects of the medicine to manifest in your life.”

Anyway, it was 4 very long days for Trooper and it was only a few days later that the same friend experienced a robbery that astounded us...he'd been so tired, left things out of the safe that didn't fit (that was resolved immediately after), and was only gone for a little while. Poor man...he has been so upset by it. We were off Friday so Trooper and I took him in the truck to the Home Depot, loaded up on new interior doors, new locks, and started hardening entries and ensuring the kids knew the changes would help keep them safe. If Trooper hadn't had to work this weekend, we'd be there continuing the projects but he has family stepping in now to aid...no better, kinder, more generous guy, and absolutely not deserving this...
Hultin and Matthews didn’t really answer regarding the pace of negotiations, instead pointing back to the general argument for the deal. Asked why the merger now, according to the 9/4/07 Polytechnic Reporter, “Hultin cited three key reasons why talks got under way: donors could not be found during the past two years who were willing to make a contribution sufficient to ensure the university’s future, lagging undergraduate enrollment, and a serious decline in research grants necessary to support the school’s activities.”

I have done the next stage of my information graphic. Personally, I’m still with my first idea. I find the new one is too wordy and the images don’t scream at you as I feel they should. We’ll see how it goes in tomorrow’s (or later this morning) lesson. But for now, here’s what I have done, the new-infographic. There are spelling mistakes which I realised after printing out, and I’ll make the changes if used as a final. I would have done a jpeg here, but you wouldn’t be able to read anything.

Roche, the makers of Lariam have received over 3,000 reports of patients with psychiatric problems resulting from the drug, from nightmare, depression, and hallucination to paranoia, psychosis, and aggression. This is the same drug prescribed to our troops to treat malaria as well. I guess it’s perfect for the U.S. Army, to have soldiers that are out of their minds when fighting unjust wars.
You can radiate beauty quite easily. Just laugh. Fill your lungs deeply with air and cut loose. You don’t need a reason or even a joke. Just laugh and your body will respond with even more, real laughter. The muscles in your face lift and widen. Your body arches. Even if you fake a belly laugh, your brain will interpret the physical sensations as a good and wonderful thing.
The right to a balanced and healthful ecology carries with it the correlative duty to refrain from impairing the environment.

I no longer feel inspire to create anything in this sewing room. Unfortunately, I don't feel the desire to clean or organize this space anytime soon. I going to challenge myself not to by anymore fabrics until I use up most of what I have and organize my sewing space.
The album recordings started in Germany at Sounlodge studios were we recorded the drums on January of 2009,all the other instruments were recorded at Massroom studios in Thessaloniki Greece in December of 2009 by Stelios Koslidis who also mixed/mastered the album, I also did additional mixing.
As I said above, I think good solos restates themes or ideas of the song. The best example of this is “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, where instead of shredding the fretboard, Kurt Cobain simply plays the melody. This isn’t just laziness: it’s lean and concise, increasing the intensity of the song. Similarly, here’s AC/DC with the live version of “Whole Lotta Rosie”: god, that riff is fantastic, but while the solo brilliantly gives the feel of the song, it doesn’t add to its meaning. You see what I mean? Metal bands often feature riff-shredding solos, and while these can be enjoyed for themselves – if you like that sort of thing; I personally think they’re fairly self-indulgent: virtuosity means nothing to me. For great guitar solos, you need something more.

The destruction that followed was horrifying. Millions upon millions of gallons of water cascaded through the strait, flooding the basin of the Mediterranean, scouring the very earth as it rushed inward. Tarshish was not only drowned, but uprooted from its foundations. The kingdoms of the river valleys were flooded and destroyed. There were, however, survivors who fled inland to smaller settlements, bearing what elements of Promethean society they could. In the wake of the destruction, Heracles was hunted down and as punishment was forcibly possessed by the remaining priest-king of Tarshish who had managed to escape the drowning. The Black Star was hunted and scattered throughout the land. Though shattered and diminished, Nephilim society survived, spreading outward to establish the rule of the Great Compromise in new settlements throughout the Mediterranean region. However, the last great dream of re-establishing Atlantis had vanished forever.
Part of Chris Alexander's stated intention with publishing THE BLOODY BEST OF GOREZONE is to test the waters for a relaunch of the magazine. I hope he can pull it off but looking back on GZ, and the ways in which the culture has changed since the magazine closed shop in 1993, one has to wonder what a new GOREZONE's function would be in today's world.
The first one was that my amazing husband and I celebrated 15 years of marriage!! We started our lives together on September 16, 1995. We were both very young. He was 18 and I was 19. We had people tell us that we would not make it. That was a very hard thing to hear when you are so young, but I am happy to say that even though we have been through some tough times, we are as happy and in love now as we were in 1995 and I believe that with God's help, we will have many more anniversary's to come!

“She let go. Without a thought or a word. She let go. She let go of the fear. She let go of the judgments. She let go of the confluence of opinions swarming around her head. She let go of the committee of indecision within her. She let go of all the ‘right’ reasons. Wholly and completely, without hesitation or worry, she just let go. She didn’t ask anyone for advice. She didn’t read a book on how to let go. She didn’t search the scriptures. She just let go. She let go of all of the memories that held her back. She let go of all of the anxiety that kept her from moving forward. She let go of the planning and all of the calculations about how to do it just right. She didn’t promise to let go. She didn’t journal about it. She didn’t write the projected date in her Day-Timer. She made no public announcement and put no ad in the paper. She didn’t check the weather report or read her daily horoscope. She just let go. She didn’t analyze whether she should let go. She didn’t call her friends to discuss the matter. She didn’t do a five-step Spiritual Mind Treatment. She didn’t call the prayer line. She didn’t utter one word. She just let go. No one was around when it happened. There was no applause or congratulations. No one thanked her or praised her. No one noticed a thing. Like a leaf falling from a tree, she just let go. There was no effort. There was no struggle. It wasn’t good and it wasn’t bad. It was what it was, and it is just that. In the space of letting go, she let it all be. A small smile came over her face. A light breeze blew through her. And the sun and the moon shone forevermore…”

My card is made using an image from StampFairy called "Patsy Beachtime" which I coloured with ProMarkers (& a bit of Prismcolor pencils). I did some machine stitching round the edge of the papers, added lots of flowers, 2 ribbons, a punched border & 2 tickets (there was a cute wooden butterfly on the fence which balanced the card nicely but I didn't notice it had fallen off when I took the photo lol).
Funny is subjective, of course. Perhaps the winner will have a slow-burning, gentle wit. Perhaps a Python-esque sense of the absurd. Or maybe the concept, and the freshness and immediacy of it, will do much of the heavy lifting.
From the beginning, the mystery of this most interesting man was kept intact. But now the story can be told. The following interview took place under less than clandestine conditions. As it was a telephone conversation I will have to take the man at his word when he tells me that his name is Jonathan Goldsmith and he does like beer... Dos Equis in particular.
Thursday was a humid, somewhat dreary day that started with a bit of rain. By the time I escaped the office the threat of rain still hung in the air, but I looked forward to my ride on Nikki. The barn was dark and quiet when I arrived with just the occasional shuffling of a dozing horse. I called to Nikki and she nickered in response, which was, of course, followed by a few bangs on her stall door. Wow, is that girl turning into a diva! Shavings in her mane and tail gave away that my baby had been sleeping. Like Suki, Nikki enjoys a flat out snooze in her stall. Nikki paused for an arabesque stretch on her wya out of the stall, then snuffled my pockets in search of treats. I know it's not advisable to feed horses treats from your hands and allow them to dig around in your pockets but......

So, actually, I won this book in the middle of the week. I had homework (why hello there, math, nice to see you). Typically during the school week (and often during weekends) I have no time to read. I read this entire book in between doing my math and English homework, because once I started I had to know how it ended.
This week's choice was a no brainer for me. I have this odd gift for remembering just about everything about any movie I have seen. I even remember things about movies that I don't want to remember like 'From Dusk Till Dawn'...ick is all I have to say about that. I pretty much kick ass when it comes to movie trivia, as long as I have seen the movie at least once.

When I exercise I try to be present in the here and now. I also like using the time I exercise to escape reality, to get into my head, to fantasize and to create stories. When I start losing steam, I just imagine four or five zombies chasing me (the kind who can actually run) and my adrenaline increases, I become more energized and I am inspired to become the strongest person I can possibly be.
Since I'm not much of a plot-ahead kind of guy, there are always what-happens-next roadblocks, both large and small. Once I've written a couple of chapters and the characters are alive and contributing their suggestions, I have a good sense of the general direction I'm heading, but the details remain fuzzy. With apologies to Aliya Whiteley's brother and sister characters in Mean Mode Median (and to Tim Stretton for citing a fantasy character with an apostrophe in his name), the best analogy I can come up with is that used by Paul Muad'Dib in Dune when discussing seeing the future: You can get a glimpse of a few hilltops and ridges in the distance, but you have no idea what awaits in the valleys between them.

What’s the solution? An organisation’s culture is like its personality — and that means its long lasting and slow to change. Fortunately, we can turn to other theories and practices from organisational and social psychology to help. We do know that influencing change relies on group dynamics and the ‘norming and forming’ processes. In essence, it’s the story of if your friend jumps off the bridge — would you do it as well? Theories of group dynamics actually suggest the answer is likely to be ‘yes’. Teams often have special tasks that isolate them enough from the broader organisational hierarchy that they have their own social structure and practices, making them the perfect place to start introducing change.

2. Sure, at one level, having some kind of "official neighborhood naming board" sounds like government micro-management and a waste of money. But if we get away from whatever vision we have of the "naming board" and examine our existing practices, it's clear that we (as locals and as government) intervene in the real estate market all the time, to the point that it's reasonable to argue that the government actually sets the terms of the market, whether through zoning laws (pawn shops, etc), bonds/tax exemptions/subsidies, community board approvals, or Business Improvement Districts (processes that often relate to naming in one way or another, whether that's the creation of an "Atlantic Yards" district in PH or the lending of names to BIDs). We need to consider the target of this legislation, which is NOT designed to prevent the "organic," bottom-up process of new names catching on. Rather, it's targeted specifically at developers who would put certain names to use in the service of their business, which is something we regulate all the time. As I pointed out already, brokers currently get in trouble for false advertising if they advertise a property that's located in one neighborhood as being in another, which means government is already in the neighborhood-name-determining business. This legislation can easily be understood as an extension of that regulatory process, a process that includes zoning laws, subsidies for affordable units, and many other interventions that the government uses to structure the market. This brings me to point number three . . .

Amsterdam is home to the world’s first sex theatres, which are like regular theatres except instead of people delivering scripted lines they’re performing choreographed sex. Also they charge three times as much while saving a fortune on costumes & set design.

Some of you who know me (chances are actually very few people I know read my blog, but here's hoping) know that last September I decided to do something really good for myself (about bloomin' time too, you may notice I'm somewhat self-depricating!) and enroll on an Astrology course. I am studying astrology with the Faculty of Astrological Studies in London, and I have to say it has been superb. The tutors are great, my fellow students are wonderful people, the course well organised, excellent materials... I however, am a bit pants at the whole astrology bit! I'd love to understand it and be able to wax lyrical about aspects, synestries, and all the rest, but still when someone says "The Sun is currently transiting my Uranus" I have the overwhelming urge to tell them to pull their pants up.
Kendrick Smithyman did not get selected for the All Blacks and I suspect that in any case he was unavailable. Actually, he was one of my University of Auckland tutors way back, and he always wore the same light brown corduroy jacket with elbow pads of a different hue. He was a damned serious dude. Scott Hamilton – the one who would rather look for dendroglyphs and mull over Trevor Bentley books than jump in a lineout – lionizes Smithyman as a marginalised figure, and it is this trenchant outsiderism in his own pieces — inspired throughout by Smithyman’s bleakly obscure palimpsests — that works so well for me in this collection.

In this scheme, the brain is in charge, having evolved to control certain fixed behaviors. Why do men see other men as rivals for a desirable woman? Why do people seek God? Why does snacking in front of the TV become a habit? We are flooded with articles and books reinforcing the same assumption: the brain is using you, not the other way around. Yet it’s clear that a faulty premise is leading to gross overreach.
The department offers programs leading to the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees, and currently has 12 faculty members, whose research and teaching interests are described on our web site at http://www.niu.edu/geology/. Facilities include an array of analytical instruments (e.g. electron microprobe, SEM, AFM, XRD, XRF, ion chromatograph, ICP-MS with laser ablation) and field equipment. NIU is part of the CARS research consortium at the nearby Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory.
Portugal controlled Timor-Leste as a colony until 1975. Less than two weeks into Timor-Leste’s independence, Indonesia invaded and began a brutal 24-year occupation. A quarter of the island nation’s population perished under Indonesian rule.
“First you have to catch us, you geezer! Thrrrrrrrrrrrp!“
But there is another way. When we set up our round-the-world airline ticket with One World, we found we couldn’t get from Nairobi to Dubai without first flying through London. When we heard our friend Eric would be visiting another friend in there in February, we extended our layover for a few days so we could see him. If we could get the table to London, Eric might be able to bring it back to the States for us.
Morello: Make something up about fighting champions versus fighting minions.
But it is understood the change may lengthen the process and have an impact on the numbers deported.
Well, Jen, get ready to hear it!
According to the Calendar of the O'Clerys, he belonged to the race of Eochaidh, son of Muireadh, who descended from the seed of Heremon. We are told, likewise, that Deidi, daughter to Trian, son of Dubhthach, was his mother. The pedigree of St. Senan of Laraghbrine is contained in the "Sanctilogic Genealogy." There he is called the son of Fintan, son to Strened, son of Glinder, son to Corc, son of Conned, son to Aengus, son of Fieg, son to Mail, son of Carthage, &c. His genealogy is then carried back to Heremon for fifty generations, or for about 1600 years. Marianus O'Gorman has noted this saint, in his Martyrology, at the present date. St. Senan must have flourished in the sixth century, and been a contemporary of the great St. Columbkille, for he is named as one of those ecclesiastics who attended the great Synod, held at Dromcreat in 580. On the 2nd of September, a festival is entered in the Martyrology of Donegal, to honour Seanan, of Laithrech Briuin, in the territory of Hy-Faelain. This place is also written Lathrach-Briuin. At present it is known as Laraghbrine, or Laraghbryan, where there is an old church and a cemetery, near Maynooth, in the Barony of North Salt, and County of Kildare.
My dress is a "Kari" dress if there ever was one. Seriously ... this is the kind of dress that I like to think was made with me (or my lifestyle) in mind. It's simple and comfortable, and it's what I've always gravitated to when I bought clothes — I went for comfort, and not style, and I didn't venture very far out of that comfort zone.
This was quite a quick card to do as all of the images were stickers that I got from Dunelm Mill. I used some dark blue pealescent paper for the backing and the gingham paper from Papermania. I had some silver mesh so I made these into little frames (thought I looked a bit like a goal). A few gems, ribbon and buttons finished it off.
Below are some other mexican-themed meals I’ve enjoyed recently!

“Working 12-16 hours for someone else was not our dream.”
The thought specifically had to do with women in movies. I’ve talked a bit before about Lord of the Rings, and specifically Eowyn’s character. She is a very strong-willed woman who can hold her own in a fight. She deals with the most perilous of circumstances and should she perish in this war, she wants to go out fighting, to face death on her own terms. She also gets a good old fashioned “I am woman, hear me roar” moment when she kills the Witch-King, a villain so powerful that even Gandalf can’t stand up to him. The exchange goes something like this:
Serving and former US Navy SEALs have slammed President Barack Obama for taking the credit for killing Osama bin Laden and accused him of using Special Forces operators as ‘ammunition’ for his re-election campaign.
I have a dilemma regarding ebook publishing. I am a seasoned graphic designer/illustrator trying to break into the kidlit industry with an author/illustrator picture book.
There’s nothing wrong with stuff being online, it’s just – even in these days of mobile internet, wi-fi hotspots and horseless carriages – sometimes it all feels a little remote. So, with the intention of having something glossy to brandish in front of my workshopees, I’ve spent the last couple of weeks pulling together a selection of my stories that have been published, online or in print, those that have done well in competitions, plus a couple of tales seeing the light of day for the first time (Yes! Exclusive
from things that I'd said.
In our mind, and inside our hearts, we just know that we can’t lay down our life for Him unless we believe that He truly loves us.
