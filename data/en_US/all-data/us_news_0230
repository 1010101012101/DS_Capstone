Mark Dayton and others expected to push again for a public subsidy package for a new stadium, the jockeying over a stadium site is expected to intensify in the first weeks of January.

Ben Stone and Alison Scott in "Knocked Up" (2007): Alison (Katherine Heigl) is an ambitious TV producer; Ben (Seth Rogen) is an aimless slacker. A one-night stand leaves Alison in the state described by the title. Her pregnancy keeps them together, though not without difficulty.

Northeast Phoenix's two City Council districts will not change much under two redistricting maps approved for final consideration this week, even though one has to shrink and the other has to grow.
But so far, there is little evidence of a new foreclosure flood, various data firms have reported. Nallathambi appears to think it's because the settlement also pushed lenders to work with troubled borrowers to avoid foreclosure.
The regular seafood dish is fish tacos (two for $8). They're disappointingly deep-fried and smothered in shredded cabbage with a bland cilantro-lime dressing. The cheeseburger ($8), labeled "Angus," is a thin patty that's cooked all the way through, like it or not. It's served in an unremarkable bun with lettuce, tomato and onion.
So, while it may be easy to beat on the working-class Joes who serve and protect, it doesn't seem terribly accurate.
Producers' success using hydraulic fracturing -- pumping a high-pressure brew of water, sand and chemicals down wells to crack and prop open fissures in shale formations so gas can flow -- has completely flipped the tenor of North America's supply debate.

Relying on phony invoices and the help of a fraudulent equipment "supplier" that took a cut of the money, Charles Schwartz, 57, of Sparta, convinced bank after bank to give him loans for ventilators and other items that apparently never existed — and that therefore never made it to Allied Health Care Services, his medical equipment company in Orange.

Statice will thrive in the empty spaces between food plants, too. They are ideal for adding useful color to a kitchen garden or herb patch. More-serious gardeners may devote an entire planting row to annual statice just as you would another food-bearing plant.

And clearly that's a job that's not getting done. Sunday's shutout was the third in four games for Chivas, which explains why the team has as many losses — three — as goals given up. And in its last 19 games dating to August, when Townsend was still in school at Maryland, Chivas has failed to score in 10 of them.
Woods announced that he will resume an up-and-down season May 3-6 at Quail Hollow, where he won in 2007. He also committed to the Players Championship the following week.

Ice Cube’s profanity isn’t the raunchiest thing about this movie. Hill almost literally grew up in the Judd Apatow world of comedy, so there are endless jokes about penises, astoundingly crude insults and far too many jokes where the only punch line seems to be “gay.”
The news that Governor O'Malley and the top leaders of the General Assembly are now considering two special legislative sessions is unheard of and preposterous ("Annapolis leaders considering two special sessions," April 24). It's bad enough that even one special session is being considered.

It was a night where Portland’s starters, following the slow start, were solid. They weren’t spectacular, but they were solid. LaMarcus Aldridge didn’t post numbers that leap off the page, but he did have 14 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 blocked shots. Brandon Roy had 17, Miller had 12, and Marcus Camby pulled down 13 rebounds. But, it was the presence of a balanced attack that was most impressive on this night.

That project is also drawing controversy.

SOUND BITE: "Garage-rock bands tend to be a little dustier," says Pat Casa, formerly of Sons of Elvis. "We've always thought the best rock comes from a finished basement.

Then there is the 80-page booklet, which is not just an afterthought, but completes the package nicely. In what is probably a recording-industry first, it’s bound with a metal spiral: it’s meant to look like the battered notebook in which Springsteen scribbled lyrics for these songs. Inside is the usual boxed-set stuff — essays and lyrics and photos — but also many pages reproducing Springsteen’s handwritten lyrics, notes to himself, album-sequencing revisions and so on.
Or maybe he would have been one of those white crosses above a beach in Japan. He'd never meet mom. So, no me. Or my children.

The first day of our trek started with a bone-jarring bus ride from the little town of Mollepapa to the Salkantay Trail jumping-off point.
There is a school of thought, one expressed by the Cardinals as they attempted to re-sign Pujols, that it is unwise to isolate too much of a team's payroll on one player. The Reds, for example, will be paying Votto $25 million in his late 30s, and without a growth in payroll that could capsize the club. Agent Scott Boras articulated another theory this past winter when he suggested that a team's willingness to spend on its best player helps attract other quality players. He used Pujols' gravitational pull as an example of why his clients, Holliday and Kyle Lohse, re-signed with the Cardinals.

Sharing its platform with Nissan's Cube and Versa hatchbacks, the Juke is thoroughly compact. Its overall length — 162.4 inches — is about even with a Honda Fit and nearly 7 inches short of the Versa hatch.

Holmgren: "As an add on to that too, Pat, I think that what will make the receivers look good is the running back. He will make everybody look better.

I don't care if bring back Otto Graham, the receivers have to catch the ball. They will be better, for a lot of reasons. That's why no one is in a panic about how the draft went as far as how our receivers went. We will not drop the ball like we dropped it last year.

We keep our vehicles a long time, so I figure any way I can extend the life of an engine is worthwhile. Any thoughts?

Hey, Steve: It seems to me that no matter the regime, the Browns have been extremely lethargic -- or gun-shy -- in adding veteran players both in free agency and in waiver pickups. It's silly to eliminate these avenues as a means of complementing your team. This is 2011 -- not 1981 -- and free agency, especially, can not be ignored by a team with multiple needs.

Isom said that it would seem like "common sense" to him that the keys would not be left in a car with a suspect inside, and that officers should stand near a car with a suspect inside.

Vampires fit this category — their blood lust and immortality push them beyond the human race that obsesses them — but they're not the only ones. Many of Rice's other works have examined the lives of people on the periphery of their societies: the castrati ("Cry to Heaven"), the quadroons and other mixed-race peoples of 19th century Louisiana ("The Feast of All Saints"), even Jesus struggling with the prophecy about him (the "Christ the Lord" series), to name a few.

He struck out the next two batters on six consecutive pitches, buckling Ian Stewart with a curve and finishing Darwin Barney with an 86 mph sinker. Wainwright escaped the inning with a popup from the Cubs' starter, righty Jeff Samardzija.

Taliaferro, who'd been on KGO for over 35 years, added: "I would like to salute the most intelligent, concerned listeners with the greatest rapport anybody could be blessed with." He, too, noted community events such as the annual Cure-a-Thon for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, which raised some $20 million over 30 years - until KGO's previous owner, Citadel, ended its involvement last year. Rothmann, who had been at the station since 1996, spoke about "the passion and love of the KGO listeners" and, noting their outpouring of supportive messages, told me, "I feel like T.S. Eliot; I've just attended my own funeral ..."

You could argue for Hammond in the top spot, but let’s see how it does against River Hill first.
Clark and Monroe spend time together, talking, laughing, skinny-dipping (!). It's all pleasant enough, though even as something based on Clark's memoirs it seems a little far-fetched. It does allow, however, Williams a break from the drugged-up, downbeat Monroe, all jitters and nerves while surrounded by British acting royalty on set (Judi Dench is particularly good as Dame Sybil Thorndike). With Clark, she is unguarded, free, and Williams is outstanding as she explores all the aspects of Monroe.

Brown has discovered a new vocabulary for this piece, which begins with the dancers' heads bowed, wringing their hands nervously as they react to an unspecified disaster in a section titled "The News." Hamilton leads a male trio in the central "Prayer" section and then joyful rhythms dispel the gloom. The dancers seem reborn in "Spring." Their hands flutter like bird wings, and they brush the space clean, assembling a three-sided opening that seems to beckon us, inviting viewers to join them at the end.

Well ... someone had to sing it, and Shannon definitely gets an A for effort, but when it comes down to it, the girl who wowed America last week just didn't have it last night. The big notes — and this song is the queen of big notes — were far off-pitch and unfortunately, the timing and melody was all over the place. Her voice is absolutely strong enough to have given a decent rendition of the mega-ballad, but the 16-year-old nerves took over this time around. Hopefully she bounces back.

øFor the exhibit, for example, the "cyclops" skull on display takes its cue from the suggestion that the skull of a prehistoric elephant called a mastodon, tipped on its side, might have resembled the skull of a one-eyed giant to the ancients, including a Roman emperor who perhaps kept a mastodon skull on display. A horn-faced dinosaur called Protoceratops, may have partly inspired the griffin.
Me? There are situations when history can be ignored. If I'm the Broncos, I take one of two defensive tackles at No. 25 overall: LSU's Michael Brockers or Memphis' Dontari Poe. Maybe I could be talked into taking Mississippi State's Fletcher Cox. I can't be talked into taking Michigan State's Jerel Worthy at No. 25. If Brockers, Poe and Cox are off the board by No. 25, the Broncos should draft one of two cornerbacks — Alabama's Dre Kirkpatrick or South Carolina's Stephon Gilmore — or go with Texas A&M quarterback Ryan Tannehill.

I think he has the right to offer his opinion, rightly or wrongly."

Now in its second season, Auden launched in late 2009, after being picked up by New York's Henri Bendel at one of the store's famous Open See events for aspiring designers. The collection is the brainchild of designer Bryce Casteneda, who makes all the pieces by hand in New York, and his business partner Steven Gordon, an L.A. native. (And Auden isn't named after the writer, but rather Gordon's 4-year-old niece.) Rihanna was the first client. Auden racked up $1 million in sales in its first year, according to Gordon.

So what happened at the store level in San Francisco? Retailers went back to the future and increased the use of paper bags. Paper bags are biodegradable and easily recyclable at the curb, but unless they've been manufactured in a carbon-neutral plant and earned a Sustainable Forestry Initiative certification, they most likely take more energy and emit more greenhouse gases during production than plastic bags. It also takes double the trucks to get the same quantity to market. So much for winning the race to the headlines.

No critique was as ferocious as the one from the essayist B.R. Myers, who in a piece in the current issue of the Atlantic — seven months after the book came out — said Harbach's tome was overhyped, because of the public's lemming-like approach to literary fiction.

Visit a dog park: There are several levels here. You can drop by your local dog park (locate them at dogpark.com), find a bench and just watch the critters play.

That contention is bunk. Baltimore could waive those costs, and Baltimore Racing Development would still owe $10 million but have only $100,000 in cash and $600,000 in assets.
