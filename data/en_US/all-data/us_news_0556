More recently, halogen incandescent bulbs have become popular. The bulbs, which cost as little as $3 for two, look and behave like incandescents by dimming and turning on immediately, but use less energy. The Philips EcoVantage line, which became available in April, uses 28% less energy: A 72-watt bulb replaces a 100-watt, and a 43-watt bulb replaces a 60-watt. Halogen incandescents last as long as a traditional incandescent bulb.

And is it just me, or is the cooking less refined? As I grazed my way across the menu, more often than not I found myself thinking about all the other, better -- and, yes, far less expensive -- versions of similar dishes available elsewhere. That whole arctic char, for example, which is dredged in buttermilk and flour and rather artlessly deep-fried. The pink flesh wasn't dry, exactly, but it wasn't the succulent, flavorful experience it should have been, and its pool of citrus-soy sauce was an exercise in saltiness. At $44.95, it's not unreasonable to expect more.

However, for every dish that didn't quite come together there are three or four that excite. I've tried for years to find the same style of thick, hearty ribollita ($8) I once had in Florence, and Bottega's completes that quest. It's so thick with bread, greens, beans and bits of carrots that it could easily be eaten with a fork. It's topped with two triangles of toasted bread slathered with fragrant olive oil.

The arrest of White House aide Walter Jenkins on a morals charge is a personal tragedy for all concerned. It also comes as a deep shock to the nation. It is unfortunate that such a scandal should break less than three weeks before a national election in which far greater issues are at stake than the personal behavior of one man. However it is inescapable that the episode will become a factor in the presidential election There is no reason to suppose that Jenkins is other than a loyal American. But it is commonly recognized that persons suspected of deviant conduct are vulnerable to blackmail attempts by the Communists. As a result they are denied security clearances. Yet Jenkins apparently had access to secret information both before and after Mr. Johnson moved to the White House.

Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said last week that the two brigades being removed from Europe will be eliminated rather than reassigned to U.S. bases. Both are based in Germany — the 172nd Infantry Brigade, in Grafenwoehr, and the 170th Infantry Brigade, in Baumholder. Odierno said that in the long run this change will benefit both the United States and its European partners because U.S. Army combat and support units will periodically rotate in and out of Europe for training and joint exercises that are designed to meet the needs of the European forces.

This is Soderlund's 12th year as Western States' race director, and he's made no secret that two years hence, at age 65, he'll hand over the reins of this increasingly unwieldy beast of a race to a new generation. He says he's not burned out - perhaps because his disposition is more steady pilot light that wild conflagration - but the kidney cancer he overcame two years ago did play a role.

So when I stumbled on a recipe on the Prudent Baby blog (prudentbaby.com) for a coffeecake in a coffee cup, I was hooked. The ingredients were insanely tiny (1/2 an egg! drops of vanilla!) and the results could be tasted in minutes because the cooking was done in the microwave.

Later, when the end of the article revealed that the DPW made a deep apology as soon as it learned of the snafu and the store owner said she felt the apology was heartfelt, my anger turned toward The Chronicle.

Neinas rose from his second-row seat, shuffled to his left and waited while a crew constructed a stage on which English was announced as the tournament's most outstanding player, and Mizzou accepted a trophy with meaning perhaps beyond a championship.

The process: 2 Towns adds sulfites to the pressed juice to prevent oxidation and spoilage. "It's the same exact process as winemaking, except instead of pressing grapes, you're pressing apples," Takush says. They settle the juice, separating out the sediment, and then inoculate that clear juice with the desired yeast strain. They ferment at cool temperatures. The cider ages at least one month and, in the case of the pommeau (19 percent ABV), up to a year or more. Larsen and Takush are in the cellar every day near the end of fermentation, testing the balance of acid and sugar. "Once we get to the right sweetness, we crash the tanks," Takush says. Turning on the tanks' cooling jackets forces the yeast to go dormant, yielding near-finished cider that still must be filtered.

Last year, I did not get called back. Because I cannot imagine not teaching, I accepted a one-year contract to teach in a new district.

Never mind the Turnpike’s contribution to the growth of their employer from an all-male college that almost moved to Hackensack to a higher education behemoth that has close to 30,000 undergraduate students on its main campus in New Brunswick. Beginning as Queens College in 1766, the school opened in New Brunswick in 1771 with a single instructor and handful of students who met for classes at a downtown tavern.

"The growing trend now is to get away from the academic kind of setting, beyond listening to a boring lecture," said Robyn Berkley, an assistant professor of management at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. "Theater makes you think in a different way. In a play, you hear it, see it, feel it and start to see the irony, discomfort or challenges laid out in front of you."

NEW YORK (AP) -- Finding out that your parents have reached a settlement in their divorce isn't normally a "happy" moment for any 21-year-old. But when you're Brooke Hogan, and your parents have been going through a tabloid-worthy divorce, getting that kind of news is almost joyous.

“A non-rotating knuckleball, thrown slow in a big arc, ‘sees’ the wind from slightly above the front-center, then directly in front, then slightly below front-center. This movement of the ‘relative wind’ (as skydivers call it) along the front of the ball will naturally produce shifts in where and how those stitch-produced swirls (‘vortices’) are produced and therefore how the wake is shaped and sized.

The tidal wave of fast-food wrappers, plastic bottles, paper bags and cigarette butts rolls across the landscape and into storm drains, where the garbage washes into creeks and the bay in wet weather. Although it may not be surprising that because of their size San Jose and Oakland pollute the most, tiny Colma in San Mateo County and a host of East Bay cities, including Pittsburg, El Cerrito and Richmond, are among the areas that add the most litter per capita, according to an analysis by this newspaper.
But the most glaring case of just how tenuous the line between the military's need for secrecy and simple political expediency came during the Vietnam War. At the time, the government tried to prevent the New York Times from publishing the then-secret Pentagon Papers, arguing it would be treasonous to release the documents. The newspaper eventually prevailed in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion.
The patients, meanwhile, made slow recoveries. Some were in the hospital for days. E. coli is particularly worrisome to food experts because it can cause severe gastroenteritis, pneumonia and kidney failure.
Worse yet, Obama, who could have been a transformative leader, instead chose to be a divisive, venal, partisan attacking successful Americans with class-warfare rhetoric, promoting socialist ideals of income redistribution and government-run health care, and in the process, demeaning and denigrating the most prestigious office in the world.

Old college acquaintance: Kyrie Irving will face good friend and former Duke teammate Nolan Smith, a first-round draft pick of the Trail Blazers.

LIFE AND LOVE: Peter Hedges is a writer-director with a knack for capturing messy family life without making it overly ghastly or conveniently sentimental. In Hedges' "Dan in Real Life," Steve Carell plays a widower and father whose life undergoes upheaval during a family getaway.

President Barack Obama said military action was not his first choice.
Every day I pick up the paper and learn that some young people have been shot in Chicago, apparently for no particular reason. They are even shot from outside while sitting inside their homes. Guns are obtained because they are obviously readily available to anyone. I am sure the Chicago Police Department is doing the best it can to prevent these happenings. My concern is with the parents, who should know what their children are doing at all hours of the night. I hold them responsible for not helping enough to put a stop to all the slaughter that is going on today. They need a wakeup call!

Similar cell tower disputes have arisen in West Windsor, Lawrence, Hopewell Township and Montgomery in past years. Liberty Towers and Karalis Enterprises are seeking floodplain relief, preliminary site plan approval and a use variance from the zoning board.
Scary is the new happy in this lair of Irish eats and ghoulish props. Stamper's, you see, serves up as many food specials as Halloween decorations during Happy Hour this time of year -- noon to 7 p.m. daily. Thursday was a howl, thanks to the corned beef sandwich and Irish egg rolls ($5 each). The latter, basically a Reuben sandwich inside of an egg roll, was as fun as the flesh-eaters hanging over the stage. But tastier. I chased it down with a $2 Miller -- one of many $2 treats on the drink menu. I swear, those li'l devils would be happier if they ditched the whole cannibalism thing and dug their fangs into these deals.

It is important to remember that the injunction is the subject of the Supreme Court's consideration of the case. Lower courts have yet to rule on the merits of the challenges to SB 1070. By acting now, without waiting for lower courts to rule on the cases against SB 1070 and similar laws in other states, the high court is injecting itself into the debate.

Bumgarner had to pitch like one in the sixth inning after his own RBI double tied the game 1-1 in the fifth. Aramis Ramirez hit Bumgarner's first pitch into the air in left-center, what should have been a can of corn for Pagan.

Some observers regard Mahsud as the most potent threat to emerge in years from the tribal milieu, a leader who has shown himself capable of unifying an array of disparate homegrown groups, even while exchanging crucial logistical aid, know-how and resources with Al Qaeda. If his coalition holds firm, these observers say, he could be in a position to threaten not only Musharraf but the Pakistani state.

President Obama misspoke (somewhat embarrassingly so for a former law professor), but he clarified his remarks one day later. One can hardly blame the president for expressing support in his signature bill or in observing the considerable precedent on his side — a point made by numerous constitutional scholars since before the measure was approved two years ago.
The luxury liner in the air had a new nickname.
Moments earlier, prosecutor Nathan Vasquez had told Walker that the case centered on the abuse of very young child, the details of the crime contained in the reports the judge had read. But more than that, he said, this was a case about the violation of trust.

At face value, the deal would create significant salary cap space for the Blazers and give Portland the ability to be a major player in next summer's free agency class. It also gives the Blazers multiple first round draft picks in what is shaping up to be a very deep draft. It may also help the team in the immediate future in signing free agents like Jamal Crawford and Carl Landry.

A: When you have an entryway facing north, it's helpful to include an additional part of the equation; is the entry facing slightly northwest or slightly northeast? That will play a big part on the type of plant material you choose to put along the 15-foot wall with its 12 inches of planting space, said UC Master Gardener Annie Kempees. It is also important to note if the area has irrigation or good drainage.

In the autumn of 1958, I tasted my first pizza as a member of the U.S. Navy at a restaurant near the Army cadet school. Five of us sailors stationed in New London, Conn., had a Saturday afternoon free from duty and decided to travel by car to the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., to watch a college football game between the Black Knights of the Hudson River (Army) and North Carolina. In our dress blues, we came to cheer on Army but could only buy seats in the visiting section. As members of rivalry military forces, we thought the West Point cadets would harass us. However, the opposite was the order of the day as they came by one at a time to chat with us and find our hometowns. After the game, we decided to get a bite to eat in a pizza parlor in the town of West Point. That is where my Navy friends talked me into having a couple of slices of my first pizza, piping hot. It was a double memorable occasion.-- Jim Debevec, Richmond Heights
Their latest album begins with a folk-rocking ballad that sounds like someone spent the weekend getting stoned to "American Beauty" and "Workingman's Dead."

11. The new heartthrob in aviation may be the Dreamliner 787. The raked tips of its wings are just the beginning, its designers say; passengers will get a smoother, quieter ride, thanks to the use of composite materials and a host of other design features. The long-awaited aircraft made its commercial debut in October on an All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong. For passengers, the pluses are the "autodimming" windows (say so long to plastic shades), bigger windows and cabins that are pressurized at 6,000 feet instead of 8,000, which means you may feel less sluggish because you are getting more oxygen. Boeing has more than 800 orders for the new aircraft, which can carry as many as 290 passengers. United/Continental, which has 50 on order, is aiming to introduce them by the second half of this year.

CLEVELAND, Ohio — Walk this way, rock 'n' roll fans.
If that seems a tad excessive, consider that in Manning's most recent nine-year playing period from 2002 to 2010, he led Indianapolis to an average record of 12-4. The Colts were 9-for-9 in playoff appearances. He was the MVP of the Colts' Super Bowl victory in the 2006 season and he led them to the Super Bowl in 2009. Then he got hurt, missed the entire 2011 season, and the Colts fell to the worst team in football.

Offensively, Ahmad Bradshaw’s return helped the Giants run for more than 100 yards for the first time since the win over New England.

The House Democrats caught a break in 2010 when the Republicans wasted most of their energy in suburban Cook County.

At first, it hurt bad, especially when I cooled down, the pain became more intense. But hey ... nothing had turned, nothing had torn, and nothing was broken. I had a stretch where I had no idea what was going on ... so, I asked for the truth, I asked, "Does it need an operation, am I out for the season?" and they said no. That's all I wanted to hear :). It was a lot of pain, but nothing too serious. There was a little stress on the tendon. This gave me a little bit of trouble in the next two games I played, but nothing too serious.

For many years I spent months at a time freelancing from Sydney's beachside suburb of Manly, part surfer's hangout/part Old World British seaside village. It was a charming and convenient location.

Rolle said he has gone out there the past few weeks with the intention of fighting for Coughlin’s job and that he knows he’s “not the only one who feels this way.” It’s funny because that was the same line he threw out there with negative connotation when he questioned Coughlin’s scheduling and ways following a blowout loss to the Colts in Week 2.

After a year's worth of hype, the brand has hit Bay Area shelves. Is it worth it? In a word, no. During a quick taste test against the a mortal Champagne (the Charles Heidsieck Reserve, see Page F5), what we'll blingily call Ay-Dee-Bee was lean, fresh and slightly herbal, but lacked the layered opulence you'd expect in that price range and grew a bit hollow on the finish. We'll take the cheap stuff, and save our money for some rims.

Brescia is the least obvious destination for the orchestra on this tour; it lacks the personal Muti connections of Naples (birthplace) and Ravenna (home) or the major cultural-center status of Moscow, St. Petersburg and Rome. But CSO officials said Brescia pushed hard for the orchestra to perform there, Muti has noted its distinguished musical history, and anyway, sometimes a spot simply works in a tour itinerary, especially if the host ponies up the orchestra’s fee.

As the economy becomes more global, American students are struggling to keep up, Curvin said, which is driving private investment in schools.

“LA was supposed to make it. He was supposed to make it,’’ Miller continued. “We have a better record than those guys (the 19-29 Clippers), and LA is putting up just as good numbers. Now, you are not going to see a lot of highlights -- Blake Griffin highlights and stuff like that -- but they are giving these young guys too much respect. Too much respect to the young guys.

Neither man is a villain. Sir William must be a deeply unhappy man, judging by a painful flashback scene where he dines with his wife and his mother (Barbara Jefford).

But although plots such as the Christmas attack have spurred changes, some security gaps that have been closed in the U.S. remain open overseas.

Rams fans continue to holler about the penalties levied against Gregg Williams, the Saints, and, to a lesser extent, the Rams.

"This is one of the oldest commercial sites in the area. It was a trading post, a saloon. It was a local post office. People could come and buy food in the deli and get gas at the Texaco station. We're in the same building that was built in 1933," he said.

Stock top-quality condiments. Good salt, such as fleur de sel or kosher salt. Decent olive oil (Deumling buys two kinds: a basic one for cooking, a fancier more flavorful oil for drizzling on finished dishes). Fresh citrus; a squeeze of lemon or orange juice can really lift a dish.

They’ve reached the Stanley Cup finals only once, in 1993, the only time they’ve gotten past the second round. They took a significant stride when they won the first two games of their first-round series against the top-seeded Canucks and put themselves in position on Sunday night at Staples Center to take a 3-0 series lead.
• Blazers, LaMarcus left to lament -- J.A. Adande, ESPN.com: Fortune favors the most determined, and while the Blazers fans had every reason to be upset about a bad goaltending call on an apparent clean blocked shot by Aldridge on a Durant layup, they’d be remiss in ignoring what enabled the play to happen: a failure by the Blazers to grab the rebound on three consecutive missed shots by the Thunder. That set up Durant’s drive to the hoop, and Aldridge’s block that quickly smacked off the backboard and back toward midcourt, only to be ruled a goaltend and tie the game at 103.
Isn't the story of Aloha very similar to Portland's own story? Just a decade or two behind, maybe. Portland was economically depressed for decades and that meant that the old houses (20's through 40s or so) were preserved instead of being torn down in the 70's and 80's to make room for new houses as happened in more prosperous cities. And now those old houses are very desirable. Yes, it's hard to imagine now (especially for those of us who grew up in the 60's and 70's) but those 60's and 70's ranch houses could certainly become 'hip' and 'trendy' among the 20 something folks in the next decade. Just like it was tough to imagine in the 60's and 70's that people would want to live in those old Craftsman bungalows from the 20's and 30's - the ones that are highly prized now. You never know... I think some of the younger folks will start looking at places like Aloha as being good places to have suburban farms - the yards are generally pretty large.
But he said he doesn't think the city has determined if or when the police will take action to issue tickets or make arrests.
For instance, allowing diabetics to schedule a time and place to check blood glucose levels, self-administer medications or eat or drink to manage blood glucose levels, or giving magnifying software or a larger computer screen to diabetics who have diabetes-related vision problems would not be considered undue hardships, and the employer would be required by law to make these accommodations.

The governor said he wants to use the additional revenue in his $32.1 billion spending plan to pay for tax cuts, increase funds for public schools and make the largest payment ever to the state’s underfinanced pension plan.
Prop. 13 and successor measures (Proposition 62 in 1986 and Proposition 218 in 1996) took taxing authority away from local elected officials, leaving them with the reduced responsibility of spending dollars whose amount was set in Sacramento or by the voters. Without the power to tax, local governments were less of an immediate threat to local pocketbooks. It was no longer necessary for business and taxpayer groups to watch them so carefully.
Murdoch's resignation is the latest in a series of developments that diminished his responsibilities since he stepped down in February as head of News International, News Corp.'s British publishing unit, whose tabloids are at the center of the maelstrom. Once seen as the heir to his father's media empire, Murdoch has been severely tarnished by the controversy and his handling of the widening phone-hacking investigation.
But if legislators under union pressure to rubberstamp the agreements need further incentive, the knowledge that approving the agreements would almost certainly doom efforts to reach a consent agreement with the state should suffice.

2:52 p.m.: Marks says Neuman's self-stimulation three or four times a day would not by itself show he was bipolar. But she says even if he lied about that it wouldn't necessarily mean he wasn't bipolar but she would want to know why he lied. She says the lying could be part of his delusion.
"Tangled" is reminiscent of the successful run of movies Disney made in the early 1990s and would fit right in with those films which included "Beauty and the Beast," "The Little Mermaid" and "The Lion King."
"I haven't met a Tamil who is completely for her," said Rustha Baskaralingam, 24, of Iselin. "We like her music, but ... I wish that she'd be more positive. I wish she'd talk more directly in the song about the way immigrants are treated, what the world is doing to us. She doesn't really say."
The junior outside hitter performed with wrecking-crew gusto Saturday night — and her Cheyenne Mountain High School teammates were nearly as proficient — as the Indians captured their third consecutive Class 4A championship with a 25-13, 25-23, 25-19 victory against Roosevelt at the Denver Coliseum.
The game definitely appeared to be going the Hawks' way by the third quarter. When Smith tried to pass the ball inside, Boston's Greg Stiemsma got a hand on it, but the ball deflected into the corner — right to a wide-open Johnson, standing behind the arc. With no one around, he swished the 3 to push the Hawks to their 65-54 advantage.

Though it's not unusual for homeschooled students to take classes in their local public schools, it's not as common for a district to create a program exclusively for them.

It’s that time of year when School Superintendent Mike Schilder thinks of snow.
Defying the usual progression for sequels, the third installment of the raunchy Harold & Kumar comedies is the series' best. In "A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas," John Cho and Kal Penn reprise their roles as stoner buddies, now estranged as the former thrives as a suburbanite businessman and the latter continues to slack. When a mysterious Christmas present brings the two back together, they commence another picaresque adventure involving drugs, a lost tree and Neil Patrick Harris as "himself," along with some surprisingly wise commentary on racial identity in 21st century America. See the movie in 3-D if possible — a lot of the jokes riff on the format — but don't feel obliged to wait until the holidays. The DVD and Blu-ray come with deleted scenes and featurettes, plus an extended cut (on the 2-D Blu-ray only).
Brown, a 51-year-old bus driver, lacks the personal baggage, but he admits Greene's improbable tale is inspiring as he skips public forums and keeps an intentionally low profile in the county executive race.
2. High-fructose corn syrup and refined flour: Corn reaps nearly 40 percent of USDA subsidies and is the main ingredient in high-fructose corn syrup, a cheap sweetener laced into packaged foods and sodas. Wheat, the second most heavily subsidized crop, gets refined into flour, a chief component of foods that nutritionists refer to as simple or "bad" carbohydrates. An increased consumption of corn syrup and refined carbohydrates, experts say, is the leading driver behind today's obesity epidemic.

The 1973-set narrative tells of George Smiley (played by Oldman with a furrowed, world-weary brow), an agent called out of retirement to help track down a mole in the British secret intelligent service. Hopping from London to Istanbul to Budapest, as well as jumping back and forth in time, the movie shows men in a drab, colorless world who harbor rich secrets and quietly shifting loyalties. There's nary a woman to be found. Dialogue is measured out carefully, as though with a beaker. Compared with "The Bourne Ultimatum," the pace verges on the somnolent.

Beyond the iPhone itself, the Tuesday event is anticipated as Apple's first major product unveiling in years that won't be led by Steve Jobs, who resigned from the CEO post in August after being out on indefinite medical leave since January.

Earlier in the evening, the hall had been abuzz as movie co-stars Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff walked the red carpet with other members of the production team and cast, including director Charles Martin Smith. While many of the movie's cast were recognizable to the crowd, there were moments when onlookers scratched their heads and wondered aloud about whom they were viewing. In some cases, it was the producer (Andrew Kosove, who spoke appreciatively to the crowd before the movie); in others, it was the real-life people who are involved in Winter's life (prosthetic makers Kevin Carroll, a vice president for Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics Inc., and Hanger's Sarasota designer, Dan Strzempka).

Some of the places Cahill includes are famous (Luxembourg Gardens, the gardens surrounding the Eiffel Tower), but others are tucked away in obscure corners of the city. The best way to find them and to get to know Paris, she suggests, is to walk. Among the green places she visits are the spacious and immaculately landscaped gardens of the Musee Rodin, a museum dedicated to the work of the sculptor Auguste Rodin (his most famous sculpture, The Thinker, is here). French painter Eugene Delacroix's apartment and studio, now a museum, has a small shaded garden with benches. The Musee de Montmartre, housed in a 17th-century building, once was the home of Renoir. The entrance to the garden is accessed through the museum's bookshop. The famous cemetery, Pere-Lachaise, not only is the final resting place of Edith Piaf, Oscar Wilde and Marcel Proust but also boasts "avenues" of cypress, sycamore and chestnut.
The very presence of appetizers and side dishes seemed like overkill; perhaps they're intended as bar food or as an alternative for those who don't want a burger. Smoked onion rings ($7) looked like 10 doughnuts piled on a plate, and the smoky edge was an interesting flavor twist and worked well with the kicky cheese dipping sauce served on the side. The breading on the two end pieces, however, had clumped together and was gummy.
Video: Obama's remarks at Lordstown today.
The June numbers largely reflect sales that were initiated in April. Sales gains could decline a bit in future months, as the spring and early summer buying-and-selling season ends. An increase in mortgage rates - which rose this week after three weeks of declines - also could deter buyers and slow a housing recovery.
The state medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. An exact cause of death was never found, although the examiner found "possible positional asphyxia," meaning the teenager's breathing could have been impaired by the position of his body at some point.

Elsewhere, North Carolina voters moved in the opposite direction from a string of states  Democratic-leaning places such as New York and Vermont as well as conservative Iowa  where same-sex marriage is now legal. Six states and Washington, D.C., now recognize gay unions.
"Why are such resources, at a time of fiscal crisis, being used to go after a community that has such political support?" Hermes asked. One factor, no doubt is that Attorney General Eric "Holder and Obama have basically been given a free ride by the mainstream media, and no one's really holding them to account."
Rafael Furcal, eight for 17 over his last five games, opened the Cardinals' first with a leadoff single and advanced to third on groundouts by Jon Jay (on the hit-and-run) and Matt Holliday. Houston righthander Lucas Harrell also got Craig to ground out, but third baseman Chris Johnson threw high and wide of first and Furcal scored.
The Daily News spent some quality time on and around SoPhi's commercial streets.

As hundreds filed into the funeral parlor, some of those closest to Matlosz had to delay their own mourning. There were still last-minute details to take care of: where each spray of flowers should go, whether a framed charcoal sketch of Matlosz should go to the right or left of a photo of his fiancee inside the funeral home (They chose right.), whether to include any slightly off-color stories in tributes to Matlosz that would be delivered the next day at his funeral.

I went down, because my niece graduates from the University of Virginia in May. I hadn’t seen Monticello in 50 years. My niece and I have a tradition of visiting historic houses to celebrate Christmas and birthdays. Going to Monticello was a gift from her and my sister.

One of the ironies of my story is that it has been used to portray the perils of the fee-for-service medical system, when in fact I have never been compensated based on productivity. At MidAtlantic Cardiovascular Associates, where I worked before moving to St. Joseph Medical Center, all members were compensated equally. At St. Joseph Medical Center, I had a guaranteed contract; the number of procedures I performed had absolutely no bearing on what I was paid. I have advocated for health care reform and I have supported this cause financially.
