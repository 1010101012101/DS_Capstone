Hey, it's just our hometown dildo factory. But here employees work in virtually every aspect of the business from shipping to product design, and that's what gave Vixen its biggest breakthrough in over a decade. The ultra-realistic, extremely hygienic VixSkin started as an employee's two-years-in-the-making formula for a shockingly realistic, skinlike material -- a material that, unlike all other "realistic" toy materials, is nonporous and can be easily sterilized for absolute cleanliness.

But as Consumers' Counsel Migden-Ostrander told an Ohio House committee, the PUCO acts as a judge, while the consumers' counsel is the lawyer for Ohio's homeowners and renters -- the ratepayers' lawyer in front of that judge.

The Los Angeles Lakers were not built through the draft. Neither were the Boston Celtics, who were disappointed that the 2007 lottery didn't deal them the opportunity to draft Oden. The Miami Heat built through free agency. And so the Blazers can sit around and talk about Oden healing all they'd like, but what they really need to do is begin battling in the front office.
Blattner said she planned to apologize to the students Thursday night on behalf of the staff member. She commended the students for being patient while the college rectified the problem.

Wills rightly feels that he has been lucky, but he has also made some of that good fortune through his determination to seize opportunities. He does not wear his erudition lightly. Or even his reading, perhaps because he grew up in such an unbookish family. When he was in grade school, his father offered him $5 if he read nothing for a week. It is typical of Wills that he took the bet, won it, and then spent the money on a new book!

Before castigating Ernie Zirkle publicly and accusing him of any wrongdoing, there should have been be a written complaint followed by, at minimum, an internal Township Committee investigation. The complaints seem to be coming from past elected officials and people with political ambition. These are people who know perfectly well that Township Committee members have NO say in Green Acres purchases. They have no basis for their allegations and it is embarrassing for them to reach these conclusions without having evidence.

He had an older brother, perhaps, in "Shampoo," in which sexy hairdresser Warren Beatty guiltlessly blow-dries his way through the bedrooms in Beverly Hills.

State Party Chairman David Parker has refused to resign — although he has said he won't seek re-election — despite pressure to step down from Perdue and other Democrats who say his presence leading the party has become a distraction.

Friday morning on national TV, Pelosi had been seen shaking her head "no" to a reporter who asked whether she would support sending additional troops to Iraq. Madam Speaker's locomotive had chugged away from the station and was heading down the track. As Americans watched, a question arose: Is the power of office any different when it is wielded by a woman, and -- even today -- do women have a harder time in office?
That lack of specifics angered John Sherman, president of the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation, who said he has collected more than 1,200 signatures on a petition seeking Hall’s resignation if the investigation confirms teachers cheated.
I am not the first to attribute our generation's greater cheating rate to technological development. While it is great that the Internet has given us instant access to an unimaginable amount of information, it has also made it easier for people to cheat. Now the solution to everything is just "Google it!" and the copy/paste function could not have made plagiarism any easier. Most students carry phones on them at all times that have access to the Internet, or at least have the capability of texting a friend who may know the answer to a test question. Not to say every student will cheat just because he or she can, but right now it is temptingly easy.
Using a streamlined set of questions, more calls are “screened out”: In the year the centralized call center has been in effect, the “screen-out” rate — calls determined to not merit further investigation — has risen from 16 percent to 39 percent statewide (calls from September through November 2011, the latest figure available).

Despite losing Adam Wainwright in spring training, St. Louis is here. The Cardinals are a wounded team that managed to claw past the reeling Braves for the wild-card spot. Albert Pujols broke his wrist during the middle of the year, but still posted superlative numbers. A resurgent season from Lance Berkman aided the Cardinals, who had the best offense in the National League. Both their starting staff and bullpen corps are shaky, though.

It was no small feat to convince U.S. officials to allow him to work with Mihailovich on the clandestine mission. By then, President Franklin D.

No matter. In the U.S., St. Patrick Day is more of a celebration of Irish heritage and culture as it manifests itself on this side of the Atlantic. Like many immigrant groups, the Irish who moved to America came for the opportunities and to get away from a bad situation. Remembering the happy traditions of the old world is fun, and what better a day to do it than on the feast day of your nation's patron saint?

“It doesn’t make sense that the causes would be unrelated, because you still can group these kids together as having an autism spectrum disorder,” says Schultz. “There are similarities. But there’s enough differences. It’s almost silly saying, ‘If you’ve seen one child with autism, you’ve seen one child with autism.’ Autism’s like a snowflake.”

-- Half of all pregnancies are unintended, although the rates are higher among women in lower socioeconomic groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent government survey on unintended pregnancy is from 2006, however, and there are some hints that rates may have declined somewhat due an expanded array of contraceptive choices over the past 12 years, including emergency contraception (which about 10% of U.S. women say they have used, according to the CDC) and longer-acting hormonal birth control methods, such as monthly injections and the weekly skin patch. According to the CDC: "Since 2000, several new methods of birth control have become available in the United States, including the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, the hormonal contraceptive patch, the hormonal contraceptive ring, the hormonal implant, a 91-day regimen of oral contraceptives, two new barrier methods, and a new form of female sterilization."

For much of the early history of the U.S., college was only for a small segment of society, the elite. As the need for more practical education and broader access to higher education became apparent if the United States was going to fully develop its engineering and agricultural sectors to outcompete the rest of the world, the federal government passed the Morrill Act of 1862, which promoted the development of land grant universities in each state. That, of course, has paid enormous dividends. The research technology that came out of these institutions built America as we know it today.

A. When I heard about it I made some phone calls. There certainly was bad publicity, and a number of people were really treated shabbily. I saw an opportunity to expand and treat people right. I thought the way they closed up was unconscionable. It's been difficult, though, dealing with all sorts of people ranging from attorneys to landlords. We had to explain: We're local and we're not going anywhere. We built 11 offices on our own.

"I've already seen the look," George writes of her passage through a city stunned by violence. "Driving through the Silver Lake hills to avoid Sunset Boulevard's panicked snarl, I climb along the incline. People are out jogging and walking their dogs, even though fires have moved closer, are no longer a distant TV hell. The higher I climb, the more I see residents take note of my car's make and color; they mentally record the license number, but more importantly my unfamiliar deep-brown face, any distinguishing marks. They look at me as if they will at any moment join together to form a human barricade if I make a wrong or abrupt move." In Granta, Richard Rayner offers this self-lacerating perspective: "Los Angeles was a lot like South Africa. The apartheid wasn't enshrined by law, but by economics and geography, and it was just as powerful. In Los Angeles I was afraid of blacks in a way I never had been. I behaved in a way that would have disgusted me in New York or London. I was a racist."

Moreover, 82% said it's important to put their end-of-life wishes in writing, but fewer than 25% have done so. More than half said they have not talked to a loved one about the kind of care they want at the end of life.

I let him know that the person who hit us wasn't trying to be rude, but that we were in an accident, and accidents are mistakes. Then my boys got to see their first arrest. Intrigued by pretend badges from a kind Clark County sheriff's deputy, they quickly moved on from questions about why the man who hit us was put in the police car. I was vague, saying he was doing something he shouldn't when he hit us, worried they were too young to separate their folks having a beer from what happened here.

In 1987, a $425 million renovation took place, creating 146 rooms from the previous count of 300 rooms. While updating most every aspect of the hotel, the redesigners took care to preserve the walnut and marble grand staircase.

Shriner, whose daughter also attends Harford's public schools, wrote to Cerveny: "In a country fallen upon such desperate economic times, it is absolute madness to hold this bonus hostage in order to force the County to negotiate a raise (cost of living or otherwise).

The court's final decision, moreover, is likely to come in June, as the campaign season heats up and about the same time as the court is expected to rule on the Obama administration's signature health care law.

"For years, Jerry and I have talked about a redesigned, re-imagined and revitalized version," Fierstein notes. "I wrote about a small drag club, but what we've always given the audience was a full-blown Folies Bergère. I felt the same thing about the living quarters of our heroes. What I'd imagined as a ramshackle assemblage of movie-star photos, feather boas and leftover stage props has often been presented as a mini-mansion. ... I've ached to strip back the glitzy silliness and recapture our original inspiration."

Bernstein had attended vigils and church services for the victims, and found that explaining her intentions to deeply wounded relatives wasn't easy. "Some would scream in pain when anyone used the words 'heroin' and 'HIV,' " she said.

It sounds as if the lady is merely being extra- gracious. Miss Manners would suppose that mothers-in-law who felt that presents were being demanded of them would not readily comply. If you are truly uneasy, you can add to your profuse thanks that you were unaware of such a charming custom, and wonder if others practice it, or it is only her dear, generous self.
“No one can get an explanation of how or why this happened, was it a media error, or what?” he stated in an e-mail to the Sun Messenger. “The diocese or which ever administrative branch of the Catholic Church should at least have the decency to clear up this issue for the time being.”

The cast is cute and sitcom ready, with Bosworth being the big comic surprise. She gives Deena a brittle edge and high-speed man-bashing/man-trapping patter that rides the razor's edge of post-feminism. Justin Kirk, the funniest thing about TV's Weeds, plays a pretentious loon best friend to the leading man and lands most of the laughs here.

Sadly, not everyone understands the line between rhetoric and action. Gay bashing, abortion clinic bombings, and the murder of doctors who perform abortions have all been preceded by use of violent rhetoric intended to dehumanize the target. It's not possible to achieve a more humane world by using violent language to score political points. Doing so creates a legacy of hate, not humanity.

But if there aren't any heart attacks or strokes in your family history, things shift. Some impressive new research has just linked even light drinking, like yours – three to six drinks a week – to a modest increase in breast cancer risk compared with women who don't drink at all. (Heavier drinking -- two drinks a day -- sharply increases the risk.) Assuming there's no vascular disease in your family and weighing the "peace of mind" factor, we'd suggest half a glass on most nights. That takes you out of the modest-risk group, gives you heart and stroke protection and lets you enjoy some vino.

A bend in the cost curve would have enormous implications. Lawmakers see rising health care costs as the central threat to household budgets and the nation's fiscal health. If Medicare's growth were to come down to a rate of only 1 percentage point a year faster than the economy's growth, the projected long-term deficit would fall by more than one third.

"In my belief, there is just not anything in policing that should be secret," Hughes said. "If we engage with the community more, we will be a better police department."
Things were white-hot in those days. I was informed by the staff at the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife that they had instructions to decline invitations to be interviewed for the film. That's how politicized things had become. The other trials I faced came from friendly fire. The film took much, much longer to make than anticipated. So, for the last year or so I endured flak about that. People worried if there really was a film.

This dynamic pricing is a new twist the Cubs are trying out this year with bleacher seats only. It means the prices will vary with demand and can change like airline tickets. Assume that I locked in those bleacher seats for Sunday's game at $27. Even allowing for inflation, that would be a 250 percent increase over the $4 I paid in '88.

​Bit off the beaten Ironbound track, but this bank-turned-restaurant is worth the trip. The broiled seafood combination is a boatload of marine munch. Better-than-average filet mignon, served smoking and sizzling on a cylindrical stone. Decent rodizio; best items include filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the juicy beef kabobs and the terrifically tender pork tenderloin. One of the Ironbound’s best sangrias here; the blue is smooth and seductive. Looks like Windex, tastes like heaven.
INDIO — The Stagecoach Country Music Festival moved into its seventh edition this weekend, and even though that's young by festival standards, Stagecoach has become enough of a cultural force that participants and fans are beginning to use it as a yardstick on their lives, like penciled growth marks scribbled on a family's kitchen wall.

It's possible the Marlins feel emboldened by the fact that when Pujols had a limited no-trade clause with the Cardinals he would submit a list of teams that he'd accept as a destination and Florida was on that list. So too were the Los Angeles clubs and Houston, he confirmed to Joe Strauss in 2010. Texas also appeared on that list.
What does the word popular mean, anyway? Let's get clear on this. There's the dictionary definition ("liked or appreciated by many people"), and then there's the other meaning, the twisted one I've heard my daughter and her friends use, which says that, in order to be popular, you need at least four of the following: good looks, perfect hair, developed breasts, clothes and accessories that are considered cool this month, and a way of making people who aren't your friends feel they aren't good enough to be your friends. In other words, there's often a lack of kindness involved, to put it mildly. I'm pretty sure that if it were in my daughter's power to become just like Girl X, she would say, No thanks. Think about it: you wouldn't really want her as a friend. So why worry about it if she snickers to her girlfriend instead of saying Hi to you?
Next, hack off the rear cab and turn it into a mini pickup truck with a JK-8 conversion kit (this one was $13,919, including installation). This gives you a 50-inch bed that's 44 inches wide (between the wheel wells). It harkens back to the early 1980s, when Jeep took its CJ-7, stretched the wheelbase and added a short bed and called it the CJ-8 (a.k.a. Scrambler).
It's easy enough to hear what attracted Tennessee-born front man Nathan Nicholson to London, where he relocated in 2000, forming the Boxer Rebellion a year later. The dude was clearly blown away by British rock, if the obvious echoes of Coldplay and Radiohead on the more dramatic highlights of last year's "The Cold Still" are any indication. Mojo loved it, praising both Nicholson's "forlorn warble" and the pop hooks.
But first, there is still ministry to share, and Story’s commitment to dispensing her candid admissions will be unchanged by motherhood, a shelf of multiplying trophies or her own struggles.
In a country with more than 5,000 years of civilization buried under its sands, illegal digs have long been a problem. With only slight exaggeration, Egyptians like to joke you can dig anywhere and turn up something ancient, even if its just pottery shards or a statuette.

Those are big books that took years to write. Taylor loves them and has plans for three more in the series, but she wanted to write something completely different. She started another Web site called Sunday Scribblings with a woman she'd never met, a Canadian living in England named Meg Genge. Each week they posted a short writing prompt designed to get the words flowing. Three prompts -- "monster," "music" and "real life" -- resulted in longer stories by Taylor that had dangerous kisses in them. Taylor thought about submitting them to magazines, but DiBartolo thought they could be a book and got busy doing some art. They'd talked about doing an illustrated book together since art school and decided to submit the story and art as a package.

Condon's parents immigrated from Ireland. His father was a foreman at a textile mill in Fall River. After they moved to Cleveland, his mother was a maid at the Clevelander hotel downtown. Condon attended St. Patrick Catholic School and West Technical High School. After graduating, he majored in journalism at Ohio State University. It was there he met his future bride, Marjorie Philona Smith. They married in 1942 and moved to Cleveland the following year, when Condon joined The Plain Dealer.

32. N.Y. Giants Coby Fleener, TE, Stanford
Mercifully the game had so few fouls that it ended at 3:45, the quickest game SLU had played this season. Majerus was out of the locker room and practically waiting for me by the time I got cross court. I went downstairs to talk to players and by 4:15, I was headed to my car. Fans had started leaving the arena when Evans had put in the rebound, and I soon found out why. Half an hour after the game, the one-lane roads that lead from campus back to the highway were crawling along, and it had started to snow lightly. It took me about 45 minutes to get to the airport -- the trip over had taken about 30.

"The Tymoshenko case has dramatically darkened the chances of Ukraine improving its image during the Euro," Ukrainian political analyst Vadym Karasyov said.

DECISION: Apparently someone didn't get the memo that everyone is still sick of this song.

"We tried to keep the same tone, the same casting sensibilities, and explore stuff in a tongue-in-cheek, humorous way," said Favreau. "So it's like an indie in that sense. But then you also have the safety net of 1,400 visual effects. I would have loved to have had those on an independent film."

That's the set-up for Garson Kanin's 1946 comedy Born Yesterday, and you can see what's coming from the start -- who will get smart, who will fall for whom, who will be de-blustered and de-fanged.

Similarly, even though they can't trace the visual evolution of the cinematic tropes -- the post-"Matrix" slo-mo, the vertical reverse zoom as a character looks up into the rain and screams, "Noooo!" -- they're still getting an excellent primer on cut-and-paste pop culture, wherein everything is a reference to something else and "originality" is a measure of how cleverly those allusions are executed.

-- AB1756 was yet another attempt to limit a 2011 law requiring schools to teach about the historical contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, as well as people with disabilities. The bill by Assemblyman Steve Knight, R-Antelope Valley, would have let school districts opt out of the requirement, but it died in committee this week. An earlier effort to repeal the law at the ballot box failed to qualify for the ballot.

NV Gonet-Medeville Rosé Extra Brut Champagne ($70, 12.5%): Hard to choose between this and the Diebolt-Vallois Rosé ($60, 12.5%) for a wine with pure, floral Valentine finesse. This time we'll side with the work of Sauternes winemaker Julie Medeville and her Champenois husband, Xavier Gonet. They're based in the Pinot-focused village of Bisseuil, and this mixes fruit from there with Chardonnay from Mesnil-sur-Oger for a nimble style. Daisies, wet dough and fresh raspberry, with rich fruit presence to balance its extra brut dryness. Disgorged July 2011. (Importer: Martine's Wines)

Still, as Mr. Romney is hardly known for his maverick tendencies, such advice may not be necessary. Safe and boring seems to be a mantra not lost on the former governor of Massachusetts. It's difficult to imagine him choosing a loose cannon (sorry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie) or even a vanquished foe (Sen. Rick Santorum can probably put away the sweater vests).
A: It is way too fluid to consider getting locked into a certain seed for a certain opponent. Besides, that ship sailed with Thursday's loss in Chicago. If you're asking whether the Heat would prefer to play the 76ers and then Pacers rather than the Knicks and then Celtics, well, duh. But with so few games remaining, it all likely will go down to the final game or two, and even then still might be somewhat out of the Heat's control. The Heat tried to tank for the 2008 lottery, and wound up with Michael Beasley. So that didn't work. Then they seemingly tried to manipulate the standings in 2010 and wound up with Yakhouba Diawara hitting a crazy banked in 3-pointer to blow up those plans in a season-ending double-overtime win over the Nets that left them with a one-and-done first-round exit against the Celtics. The seedings simply will happen. If you truly consider yourself a championship contender, then you had better be prepared for anything and anyone.
A similar quandary is confronted by Daud, an isolated Brooklyn boy and son of the local imam, in the sensitive, subtle "David" (7 p.m. Thursday).

* I didn't understand sending Dennys Reyes back out there to open the ninth after he'd beaten the odds by delivering a scoreless eighth. The big fella has a career 8.05 ERA at Coors; the Cardinals got away with using him in the eighth. So why press your luck there? And why push it with Reyes after he'd ended the top of the ninth by hitting a ground ball and jogging down the line in the direction of first base? Why not just open the 9th with Franklin or Boggs? I believe Franklin is better when he opens "clean," -- coming into a game with the bases empty. But a clearly gassed Reyes was allowed to face four batters in the ninth, and three reached. Franklin inherited a mess.

Prop. 28 is designed to trick voters into thinking it strengthens terms limits when it does the opposite. The measure weakens term limits for state legislators and lengthens the amount of time that they can stay in one office. If this measure passes, it means that most state legislators will serve a full decade in office without having to deal with a competitive election, because incumbency is such a powerful force in elections. Limiting service to six years in the Assembly and eight years in the state Senate ensures that these elected officials do not forget the voters put them in office.

If you’re put off by this band’s handle, it’s hard to blame you. Why a period after Portugal, but none after The Man, for instance? It suggests imprecision, and perhaps an inability to properly punctuate musical phrases. In the past, these Wasilla, Alaska psych-rockers have been guilty of failing to develop their ideas, but with each release, the songwriting has caught up a little more with the instrumental talents of the four musicians. It’s still not all the way there, but “In the Mountain in the Cloud” is the band’s most realized work yet — a hybrid of modern-day glam rock, freewheeling jam band roots music and ’70s prog. (One bass outro is so close to Yes’ “Heart of the Sunrise” it ought to have quotes around it.)Songwriter John Gourley has always been able to come up with catchy bits; here he has managed to fashion them into choruses of zonked grandeur. “Got It All (This Can’t Be Living Now),” “So American” and especially “Everything You See (Kids Count Hallelujahs)” are impressive post-Bowie art-pop compositions. As for what it is that the excitable Gourley is singing about in that helium falsetto … well, that’s between him and the sandman.

But some political advisers argue that an election-year epiphany on the issue would be seen as simple political opportunism at a time Obama's campaign is eager to highlight principled decisiveness.

To determine the investment allocation that's appropriate for you, you must first make a good assessment of your risk profile, investment objectives and liquidity needs.

Smaller credit unions themselves are worried about the money-grab from a few of the largest credit unions. Recent letters from credit union CEOs highlight this fact. A letter from the CEO of the Glendale Area Schools Federal Credit Union to the Senate leadership stated this concern on behalf of what he calls the "silent majority" of credit unions that neither wants nor needs this legislation. Dennis Moriarity, treasurer-manager of Unity Credit Union in Warren, Mich., wrote that he is concerned that the expanded authority would expose the thousands of credit unions that do not engage in business lending or are not at ease operating within the current limits of law to increased risk. He noted that credit unions that comply with current law could be forced to pay for the mistakes of credit union lenders who are "unfamiliar with the complexity of business lending or who might ignore risks in pursuit of revenues."

I don't want to get picky, but I've been to Myrtle Beach and OC's boardwalk is definitely better. Really. I'm not biased just because I'm a Marylander who writes a blog about OC. (I haven't been to Coney Island or Atlantic City, so I can't disagree on that.) Myrtle Beach recently added a mile-long promenade that has wooed more visitors, which the magazine notes, so that may be the reason they get the nod ahead of OC.
