Agnieszka Holland's In Darkness, nominated for a foreign-language Academy Award (it lost, to A Separation), is set in the city of Lvov, then part of Poland and now the Ukraine, in the midst of World War II.

"Blown Away," the new album by Carrie Underwood, the shiny but tough country star, starts out loud, sassy, rollicking and wise. "Good Girl" is the first song -- a little Pat Benatar, a little Tanya Tucker -- and it plays out like a sequel to Underwood's 2006 smash "Before He Cheats," except instead of taking out her rightfully stoked dissatisfaction on her ex, she opts for unity and warns the next woman instead.

All eyes will be on the Scottrade Center tonight, except for mine, which will be watching SLU play Arkansas State at Chaifetz. I think this one is fairly cut and dried: Mizzou is playing well defensively and Illinois is having trouble scoring, which all points to an easy win for the Tigers, who I think are a notch or two better than the Cornell team that almost beat the Illini earlier this week. I also pick SLU to beat Arkansas State by 20, not that anyone asked.

The loss of life was staggering — 1,517 people died on April 15, 1912, including some of the world's richest and most influential people.

More than 90 percent said the law imposed added costs, ranging up to $80,000 for training alone, he said.

It goes on - in that 100-percent-right- v.-100-percent-wrong mindset that passes for thinking among zealots - to castigate everything that NATO ever did or tried to do, including its involvement in the Yugoslav war which, rather than being a tardy response to genocide, the standard criticism, only made things worse, right up to its recent intervention in Libya's "NATO-enabled civil war."

The four main courses continue to follow the season, with such items as a fricassee of wild mushrooms spooned over a custard-like corn-goat cheese clafouti ($16.50) perked up with sweet, earthy beets.

With this group, Shearing developed what came to be known as "the Shearing Sound," which involved not only the makeup of the band — vibes and guitar generally were not both found in quintets — but also the style in which he played the piano. He used the "block-chords" technique to create a big, lush, orchestral sound. In his book "The Jazz Years: Earwitness to an Era," Feather wrote that Shearing "developed a new and unprecedented blend for his instrumentation."

The signage is just terrible. It tells you lots of stuff you don't want to know, and leaves out a great deal of stuff you do want to know. It's an exhibition designed by the department of photography at SFMOMA, and the signage very much resembles that of a conventional photo show: Name of photographer (if known), name of photo (if named), date (if known). Occasionally there are longer bits of text, and most of them are about the significance of the earthquake in the history of photography.
The victory, the 10th straight and 13th in its last 14 games, pushed Maryland (31-4) into the Elite Eight for the first time since 2009.

That western Mesa site that introduced me to Target? It's now Mekong Plaza, a Vietnamese dining and shopping center. Its supermarket is stocked with items that never reached the Mesa of my youth — fresh parrotfish, giant durian fruits. Nearby, the new light-rail line leaves for Phoenix, defying this region's car-centric culture.
For decades, pediatricians have recommended 100 percent fruit juice as a source of vitamin C and water for healthy infants and children. Federal dietary guidelines allow a 6 ounce glass to count as a serving of fruit. The federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children known as WIC - which provides food assistance to over half of all U.S. infants and a quarter of children ages 1 to 5 - provided high amounts of fruit juice up until just two years ago.

Q: Last spring, a person came through our neighborhood seeking new customers for his lawn care business. He told me he was looking for resources to expand his business and offered to provide lawn care in exchange for a $2,500 lawn tractor and $200 weed trimmer I owned. I drew up a contract that we both signed. As time passed, he provided no service, and it became clear he simply sold the equipment to someone. I would like to sue, but the man has no permanent address and probably no assets. Is it worth my while?

ø•Are you wondering what alien has occupied Boston Red Sox outfielder Ryan Sweeney's body and produced the .368 average? While toiling in relative obscurity with the Oakland Athletics, Sweeney demonstrated fine plate patience and made consistent contact. Only a lack of pop in his bat kept him from being a useful fantasy asset. So far in Boston, though, he has changed his approach - he rarely walks, and he is striking out more frequently. Sweeney's average is being driven by a whopping .457 BABIP. With his current plate approach, his average will plummet when his BABIP comes back to earth. And his lack of power is one problem he couldn't solve by moving back east. Look for a cold spell in the near future.
"I haven't seen anything, I'm just hoping," Dutrow said of his horse liking an off track. "We're hoping for rain because we feel like it would give us a better chance of picking up some pieces.

Because the Seminoles are thin at the position this spring—and because Pender was good enough to rush for 1,543 yards and 17 touchdowns (11.9 yards per carry) as a high school senior—they’ll look to the talented freshman to make a case for himself immediately. Freeman did the same thing when he enrolled early last January.
Omodt wrote in the e-mail that he had been assigned by the board to be in charge of both day-to-day operations and overseeing the legislative auditor's recommendations. But he said that based on the auditor's findings, "and some of the events from tonight," he was unable to do both.

Later in the evening, live music, ranging from classical to salsa to hip-hop, gets added to the kaleidoscope of activities. Music lovers should take time out to wander the grand open spaces of Colton Lawn and the Custom House Plaza, watching the party from a distance.

That year I had started getting serious about bicycling, and carried a touring bike with me on the band's bus. I was riding every day, in whatever city we were playing, or into the countryside on days off. An important milestone for a long-distance cyclist is a "century" -- riding 100 miles in a day -- and all that spring and summer I had been building up to that challenge. I did my first 50-mile ride in Kansas, then 75 miles in the St. Louis area.

Put yourself in the government’s position. Imagine you spend $100 at the supermarket for groceries and pay with a credit card. When the bill comes due, you have only $60 in the bank. No problem — just borrow $40 and pay your bill. Keep on with this financial plan and see where you wind up.

The kids have to trust that the site is theirs, that it's a safe space, that their work is primary.

8. The frantic pace of the battle atop the cornucopia, with the beasts snapping from below, makes for great movie action. Yet it ends all too soon for Cato. He falls into the clutches of the beasts, cries out for help twice and dies as Katniss fires an arrow seconds later. Where's the agony that Katniss endures listening to Cato moan and beg for hours? Where's the fear of watching Peeta bleed to death from a leg wound? The mercy killing is so much more enthralling in the book.

In some chapters, the split between the mind understanding the humans' effects on the environment and the body feeling the change in seasons, hearing new sounds in the woods around his house, smelling the summer tide, is pronounced. Safina's writing projects the beauty around him onto the pages, also the sounds and smells: "An airplane drags slow thunder. A dog barks. The twilight woods tinkle with the calls of unseen birds already self-secured into briar-tangled roosts," he writes in March. In a gusty wind in April, his neighbor's picnic table finds "its inner driftwood." Most readers will gravitate to these observations more than, say, "Land, water, population growth — violence." I am certain that Safina hoped to draw these realities a little closer by opening our hearts first, and he does. The personal is political.
But while Occupy Detroit is focused on political activity, activists want to help bring diverse groups together, too.

The pairings: Stephane Lacroix likes to introduce diners to small- production wines such as the 2002 Warwick Estate Three Cape Ladies, a South African Cabernet Sauvignon blend that focused the flavors in the veal tenderloin with crispy sweetbread and Bordelaise sauce. Finding a wine to go with a pungent sweet-and-sour sauce isn't easy, but his choice of the 1999 Henschke Chardonnay from South Australia was brilliant; it helped to cool things down a notch without destroying the pleasant, tingling sensation that went along with it. If possible, the 2003 Tablas Creek Vineyards Esprit de Beaucastel Blanc became even better -- showing a complex, fruity side -- paired with the halibut and spot prawn ravioli.

It was something we could do because we had so much s— from the app that had yet to be released. All I have to do is write an essay, I think, maybe a couple of other things. But, even if I write something, Peter's going to edit the f—ing s— out of it. The way I look at our relationship is, it's like Bob Zmuda and Andy Kaufman.

Now I know this isn’t socially acceptable to admit publicly, but I love alcohol. There, I said it. In fact, I like alcohol so much I thought the movie Leaving Las Vegas was a romantic comedy.

It has become increasingly clear that the high-skilled jobs our manufacturing sector is creating must be filled by workers educated with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM.

In 2004, you called for the IRS to investigate a Catholic bishop who didn't even mention a candidate by name, saying instead that the bishop's comments in a letter to church members were nonetheless "code language" for an endorsement.

A third major point is that we need to start teaching parenting early. Fourteen-year-olds in juvenile detention often have kids but lack any ideas on how to parent properly.

Hey, Stanley: Wow! You have it all figured out. I really think the Browns will try to land RG3 at No. 4. If not, Richardson is a viable option. Some experts rank him right up there with Adrian Peterson coming out. I think No. 22 might be a little high for Adams and they need a playmaker there. Minnifield at No. 37 isn't a bad idea. Royal is intriguing, but he's only 5-10.

Activists are certainly within their rights to insist that had the African Union or the United Nations intervened in 2004, that intervention might have prevented the current chaos.

The hope of Parent Revolution and many of the parents at Desert Trails is to use the charter petition to negotiate a deal with the district under which the school would remain under its wing, but with substantial autonomy, including the ability to fire whichever teachers it wants. But would the district be remotely interested? It would retain the state funding for those students, yes, but it would take responsibility for the school's performance with no ability to control what's going on there. That's not real accountability. And the teachers union would almost certainly see this as the slipperiest of slopes; if it agrees to the firing of whichever teachers Desert Trails parents don't want it abdicates its role as protector of its members' jobs to the extent possible.

It certainly looks like the Kentucky Wildcats mascot sports a unibrow itself. And when Davis threw down a nasty one-handed dunk off a lob against the Louisville, the Louisville Cardinal mascot was seen brushing the area where his eyebrows would be and giving a thumbs down. After another big Davis play soon after, the Cardinal was seen subtly shaking his head. And after the final horn against the Cardinals, Davis and his unibrow stalked the court yelling "My time!" or "My gym!" After his 18-point, 14-rebound, five-block performance, no one could argue.
