When Minnesota Bank and Trust opened in Edina in 2008, CEO Kate Kelly was determined to make it a place people wanted to work.
The Tigers (16-5) have dropped games to teams from Memphis, Chicago and New Orleans. But when the McCluer Comets eked out a 60-58 win, it marked the first time since last year's season opener against University City at the Borgia Tournament that Soldan was beaten by a team that resides within St. Louis County. Borgia, of course, has two wins against the Tigers in the Class 4 semifinals the past two seasons, but that school is in Franklin County.
A man in Baltimore shipped down 70 boxes of stuffed animals. Miller's Ale Houses throughout the region agreed to start collecting donations.
So you're British, and you're ticked off that the mayor of London, currently up for re-election, is refusing to debate opponents. How do you express your distaste with this? Why, you dress in a chicken suit and chase a mayor lookalike around town. And you make it clear that this will keep happening until the mayor caves. Personally, we like this approach way better than the junk mail attack ads we get in this country.
Lapierre tied it with 1 minute 27 seconds to go as he whacked the puck near the Anaheim blue line and the puck went in off Ducks winger Sheldon Brookbank's glove as he tried to block the shot.
Can anyone disagree that far too many residents in Central Indiana have put themselves at serious risk because they smoke, weigh too much and don't exercise enough?
They're wrong. The abandonment of the case management system is a barely tolerable defeat — not for one side or the other in some obscure struggle for control between local trial courts and central administration, but for Californians who are entitled to, and have been paying for, a judicial system that serves their needs with modern facilities and accessible, up-to-date technology.
He’s a good-looking actor and a talented chameleon (going, in a few years, from playing the starving Bobby Sands of “Hunger” to action heroes in “Inglourious Basterds” and “Centurion.”) But he’s safe here. Rochester’s self-loathing needs to be scarier, his passion more fiery. (What a great part this would have been for Clive Owen.)

Square Books was my first stop in Oxford. I walked east on Van Buren Avenue from the 5 Twelve Bed & Breakfast, passing the Old Venice Pizza Co., once the site of Devoe's Gathright-Reed Drug Co., whose lending library Faulkner frequented a century ago. For years, Gathright-Reed was one of the few places in town to sell Faulkner's books; until relatively late in his career, Faulkner was largely disregarded in Oxford, referred to as "Count No-Count" for his aloofness and his apparent aversion to hard work. This, of course, was not merely a local perspective: Before the 1946 publication of "The Portable Faulkner," which collected and contextualized his writing, most of his books were out of print.

With spring ending and summer beginning, baseball and other sports activities are in full swing for many of our kids. And in some circles, youth sports get a bad rap. It is true that sometimes the balance between just being a kid and becoming the next professional athlete can get thrown out of whack.

Initially Pressman wanted the second type of fry on the menu to be a sweet potato fry, but Silverton says that they quickly realized they had never had a sweet potato fry that they really liked. In the process of searching for an alternative, Silverton gained inspiration from two New York restaurants, Jonathan Waxman's Barbuto and April Bloomfield's the Breslin, both of which feature broken and fried potato chunks. Waxman's are peeled and served with roast chicken, and Bloomfield's are cooked in duck fat.

Even though spinal stenosis is caused by arthritis in the back, back pain is not the most common symptom. People with spinal stenosis most often notice pain in the buttocks, along with weakness, numbness or pain in their legs when they stand, walk or try to lie flat. The symptoms generally go away when they sit or bend over because those positions move the arthritic joints away from the nerves, increasing space in the canal.

The legislation, which also seeks to head off an automatic cut in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, is less generous than a version that Obama and congressional Democrats have championed. The newer measure would be financed by cutting federal workforce salaries, requiring higher earning elderly people to pay more for Medicare and raising some federal fees. But it ignores the higher taxes on the rich that Democrats would use to cover the costs of their proposal.
"Hoiles displayed that rare mixture of principle and worldly practicality" which was necessary to transmit his ideas to literally millions of newspaper readers over the course of several decades.

The national debt has grown significantly in recent years and it keeps rising at this very moment. The way that people get into debt is from spending and I believe that the U.S. has been spending too much. I am not very involved with politics or with the government, but from what I have seen, the U.S. is spending a great deal of money on useless things. I think it is time for major spending cuts. They need to start using their spending money to repay all the countries they have borrowed from in the past. If the spending does not stop, then the U.S. will continue to go further in to debt. With out all the useless spending, the U.S. can save some of that money to pay off the debt that has grown significantly. They can start to pay it off slowly, but a little at a time is better than nothing. I am just a high school student so I understand that my knowledge of economics is basic. However, this is the only solution that makes sense to me.

While her husband served as president, Betty Ford's comments weren't the kind of genteel, innocuous talk expected from a first lady, and a Republican one no less.

But this isn't a big problem for larger animals. With comparatively less surface area in relation to the size of their bodies, they are able to retain heat much more effectively. Fur or hair thus becomes less necessary, and perhaps, in warmer climes, even a little uncomfortable. It's not a hard-and-fast rule, but it is a strong tendency, one that should hold for feathers as well.
• Yellowjackets aren't very likable and account for at least 90 percent of "bee stings." European paper wasps are often mistaken for wasps or yellowjackets, but are actually beneficial predators of caterpillars and other insects. Both take up residence in yards, so use traps for yellowjackets (they don't work for paper wasps or hornets). Eliminate favorite nesting sites like hollowed-out areas. Insecticides are effective on active nests, but apply at night or early morning. More at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/ insect/05525.html

Mostly, however, Bastianich's stories make him sound like a jerk. He says Mexicans are the hardest-working restaurant employees but Ecuadorians and Peruvians generally have "more culinary aptitude." He once stole flowers from a church cemetery to bring to a legendary chef of Roman cuisine.

But remember that resentment is powerful fuel for political movements, and the fires of backlash are still burning on the American right. The challenge for women (and their male allies) is to hold up a mirror to the real America — where the vast majority of women want and, at key points in their lives, use birth control — and to expose the phony arguments and bogus values of the party that would deny them that right.

The interior is more impressive than you'd expect. However, I'm still looking for the story behind the Pinocchio emblazoned on a mirror downstairs and on a mural above the upstairs bar, where he appears to be stuffed in the attic.

And what's the picture in the last one?

My aunt gave me this sofa 30 years ago. She told me that it came from the Hollenden House hotel in downtown Cleveland. Her husband was doing some remodeling work there in the 1940s and brought it home because they were throwing it out!

The town and the Traer Creek Metropolitan District signed a settlement "term sheet" in October of last year. That document set a path to end litigation that began in 2009, and avoided a trial that was set to begin Oct. 31 of last year. By early spring, a settlement was still eluding the parties, so District Judge Tom Moorhead re-set a trial date for April 16.
Wornum was also vulnerable because earlier in the season, he had taken a strategic risk, and chose to send two of his teammates, Jay and Jennifer, to the rival Red Team. His thinking, he says, was to send the strong Jay-and-Jennifer team away because he believed Jay was planning to send Wornum, his father, or Black Team leader Marci home.

Think about this. Barnes & Noble—a company that is, ahem, hardly in the forefront of technological innovation—has managed to put together a pretty good Android tablet from scratch in short order, and is selling it for $250 (and even less if, like me, you catch a promotion). It's not a top-of-the-range model, but it does include a superb screen—and analysts will tell you that's typically one of the most expensive parts of a tablet.

As is often the case in public debates this conversation seems anchored mostly in volume, meaning it's about who can scream the loudest? There is little useful or dispassionate reflection on what this debate is about: religious freedom, religious diplomacy, private property and what it means to cry fire in a crowded theater when that theater is a nation at a crossroads.
Much to my surprise, the Port Authority media office told me it shouldn't be a problem. They added that there was no rush because construction slowed at about the 90th floor; it was something I didn't really understand that has to do with the building's mechanicals. When I didn't hear from them for a couple of weeks, I called back and was assured I hadn't been forgotten. It was just really windy up there, I was told, even on calm days down below. I should be ready for a call on 24 hours' notice. I certainly understood. As much as I coveted the view, I had no interest in becoming airborne.
One of them puts his jumbo cup and a backpack on the side farthest from the lifeguard shack. He looks around furtively, grabs a can of Bud Light from the bag and pours it into his cup, using his body as a shield from prying eyes.

As the Cardinals prep for the start of Grapefruit League games Monday at Roger Dean Stadium, they figure to see a much more reliable and gifted defense in the field. Furcal returns on a two-year deal to start at shortstop. Jay is set to start in center with former Gold Glove winner Carlos Beltran in right. Freese feels more agile in the field another year removed from ankle surgery. It's possible the Cardinals will improve or maintain defensive skill in at least seven of the eight fielding positions.
Of the projects the House and Senate added, Ehrhart said, “At least we’re providing educational opportunity for Georgia’s children instead of statues of peanuts and mules. I don’t think human nature lends itself to taking politics out of every situation.

Those sums pale beside the largest dues deal that Hodgson found: Comerica paid $202,928, including an initiation fee, for CEO Ralph Babb to join a club in Dallas. Babb, incidentally, is a former St. Louisan; he once worked for Mercantile Bank. Comerica received a cash infusion from the U.S. Treasury's TARP program, and TARP requires recipients to have a "luxury expenditures policy." Apparently, though, it doesn't require them to quit paying for luxuries.

Typically, a bad offensive start in an Arena Football League game is crippling.
Hey, Ted: Flynn must be thoroughly evaluated. Here's what I don't like about him: 1. His size and arm strength are not much different from McCoy's. 2. I'm not sure how much he can lift a mediocre team -- a requirement of a true franchise quarterback. I believe his surrounding cast has lifted him. 3. You just never know how a backup will react when he is elevated to the starting job and all the responsibility falls on him. These concerns don't disqualify him, in my opinion, but allaying them would take a lot of research. I do agree if the Browns could find their quarterback outside the draft, they could really make some hay in the draft developing a supporting cast.

"And to get that done this season is a masterful job, because every coach I've talked to, except maybe Pop, has been frustrated about not having enough time to coach, figure out a rhythm of confidence. I would give San Antonio a little more of an edge because of how they're coached. They're strong, smart and fundamentally sound. And those things win in playoff basketball."
Sowell seemed strained to remember. He often leaned forward in his chair, resting his elbows on his knees, then would spring to an upright position when a detail occurred to him. He threw out vague memories of women’s clothing - fancy jeans, a light blue jacket. He remembered a few names, too.

The final word on that, of course, will come from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Newly elected, Clinton puts first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in charge of developing what becomes a 1,300-page plan for universal coverage. It requires businesses to cover their workers and mandates that everyone have insurance. The plan meets strong Republican opposition, divides congressional Democrats and comes under a firestorm of lobbying from businesses and the health care industry. It never gets to a vote in the Democrat-led Senate.

Indeed, Butler has been getting the job done — with Howard playing a crucial role in each tournament win.

That infusion will not last. Most of the money received by the Sports Authority from Xanadu -- $160 million -- has now been spent, with only about $15 million left to offset future budget shortfalls.

Like the beautiful October afternoon in 1989, when the San Francisco Giants were playing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. And then, out of nowhere, came an earthquake. It caused the Cypress Structure of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to pancake and caused a big fire in San Francisco's Marina district. Brick buildings collapsed in San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Watsonville. The earthquake lasted only 15 seconds, but it killed 63 people and put the fear of God into millions. The Little Big One, Herb Caen called it.

Maybe the best we can do for now is to adopt the transparent approach of John Calipari, the Kentucky coach. He makes no apologies for what he does. He recruits players who plan to turn pro after a year or two and doesn't pretend that he expects them to graduate.

Rauschenberg was widely regarded as a principal bridge between Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s and Pop art in the 1960s, but he did not subscribe to any narrow doctrine. His work also influenced the emergence of Neo-Dada, Minimal, Conceptual, Post-minimal, Process and performance art. His deep and abiding interest in printmaking facilitated a major revival in the medium, and his achievements in lithography were instrumental in the creation of a contemporary market for prints. In Europe, the humble, everyday objects of the Arte Povera ("poor art") movement expanded on his use of cast-off materials retrieved from the trash bin and the attic.

Cities and suburbs offer much more sustenance than dry scrubland -- with little of the risk coyotesonce encountered when ranchers and hunters shot them as a matter of course. Coyotes sleep in hedges and drainages. They migrate along storm channels and miles of Southern California Edison easements. They drink from pools and pet bowls. They prey on cats and small dogs. They eat fallen fruit, dig scraps from compost heaps and raid bird feeders, trash cans and bags of pet food.

The benefits of direct job creation aren't just transitory. It's well documented that persistent unemployment results in a permanent loss of output and labor productivity.
