I appreciate that you have delayed the markup and pushed back the deadline by which the minority may offer amendments. And I appreciate you inviting EPA to explain its work to the committee this afternoon. However, while I respect your intent, the issue before us is not whether we understand EPA’s 38-page discussion paper on S. 1733 and its current analysis of Waxman-Markey. Rather, the issue is that the committee lacks a full analysis, with modeling runs, of S. 1733. Having an EPA briefing does nothing to change that. In all due respect, I might also mention that we received this bill on Friday at 11:30 pm and even if we did not have problems with lack of analysis to be marking up this bill today seems premature. We need time to read the bill and prepare amendments.

Even with a full schedule of classes — everything from French food to Thai, from homemade pasta to cookies — many sell out. And that’s despite the economy, or perhaps, as Sanderson suggests, because of it, as people choose a cooking class as a practical alternative to a weekend getaway or an expensive Saturday night dinner. “They’re doing this because they’re cutting everything else out of their budget.”
The sacrifices could soon be over.

The campus will keep a two-tier approach to admission, with local students getting preference over outside students. But the local students will need a higher grade-point average than the traditional 2.0 Cal State minimum -- a solid C average. Now they may need to earn a 2.3 or 2.4 GPA, San Jose State President Mohammad Qayoumi said. That's a high C average.
Then Giancarlo Stanton homered off Santiago Casilla (0-1) in the 10th to bail out Bell. Stanton's third long ball of the season followed a wild ninth that saw struggling Bell blow his fourth save in seven chances and raise even more doubt about the back-end of Miami's bullpen.

But the system is a fragile one. Old plants require more-frequent checks to make sure nothing is in danger of breaking down. Since it can't afford to shut down plants for long, Tepco is asking maintenance crews to speed things along by working double shifts. Some repairs that were typically done during the week, are now performed at night and on weekends, when power demand is lower. Communities are being asked to host extra generators on an emergency basis, says Masanori Minami, a manager in Tepco's thermal-power department.

Housing remains the economy's main weak spot, the report showed.
It's hard to imagine the pretty port that Austen experienced when she arrived from Bath in 1806. Southampton then was known for its narrow medieval alleys and Tudor-style half-timbered buildings whose upper floors hung precariously over the streets. The town was a stopover in the spa craze that swept England during the early 19th century. Life in the navy towns of Southampton and nearby Portsmouth excited Austen's creative mind, fueled in part by the presence of her brothers Charles and Frank, who served in Portsmouth (and eventually became admirals in the Royal Navy). The Portsmouth scenes in "Mansfield Park" are the only time she actually sets a portion of one of her novels in Hampshire, the region where she was born, lived almost all her life and died. Unfortunately, the Navy connection has all but erased the cities Austen knew. Nazi bombers hammered the wharfs and port during World War II, and what Adolf Hitler didn't destroy, misguided urban-renewal plans finished off. What is left is a sterile city with just a few pockets of Old World charm intact. The area where Austen lived around Castle Square has been completely modernized. A potentially wonderful remnant is the historic Dolphin Hotel on High Street. Jane and her sister, Cassandra, attended dances there, but when I visited before a Cunard cruise out of Southampton a few years ago, it was more than a bit sad and run-down. Not a place to stay. However, I received a report last summer that the hotel had been sold and a major refurbishment was in the works, in part to benefit from interest in Austen tourism. I still can't recommend it for stays, but I will be interested to hear about the progress. Southampton is a great gateway for visiting Jane Austen country, particularly for those arriving on the Queen Mary 2 or another Cunard liner.

Another possible issue is the legal case of Turner vs. School District of Clayton. A St. Louis County Circuit Court judge is determining the consequences of a 1993 state law which allows children in unaccredited districts to transfer to nearby accredited districts.

Anyway, that doesn’t mean you’ll refrain from blaming Schiano, of course — even if it wasn’t the coach committing those three quick turnovers. Two of those three were committed by the quarterback who everyone had badgered the coach to promote after his original choice as starter proved to be — ain’t irony a kick in the head? — too mistake-prone.

The man from whom President Obama has sought incessantly to distance himself, George W. Bush, also had occasion during his presidency to announce to the nation a triumph of intelligence: the capture of Saddam Hussein. He called that success "a tribute to our men and women now serving in Iraq." He attributed it to "the superb work of intelligence analysts who found the dictator's footprints in a vast country. The operation was carried out with skill and precision by a brave fighting force. Our servicemen and women and our coalition allies have faced many dangers. . . .

The waiver rule is part of the polluters’ agenda across the country to get rid of environmental protections. The rule has nothing to do with New Jersey, but is part of Christie’s national agenda to sell off New Jersey’s environment to polluters and developers.

Since the waiver rule is so vague and open-ended, it will allow for abuse and political pressure from developers and polluters.

What Adam Wasserman, the president and CEO of the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, needed was a safe landing.

Appel has hit 99 mph on the gun in a game this year. "Usually in the first inning he's above 95, then settles in at 92," Filter said. "Toward the end of an outing, he picks it back up and you'll see the 96-97 again later in the game."

Even without any of that stuff Matt has been able to build a very large business that is continuing to grow.

For manufacturers, cutting salt requires more than just laying off the shaker. Salt balances flavors and textures in products like bread, cheese, cereal and yogurt-based drinks that don't necessarily taste salty. It acts as a preservative, fighting the growth of bacteria.

Rasmus, who said he didn't watch the World Series because he never does, was voted three-quarters of a share and will get a ring. But for the Blue Jays, Rasmus, in essence, did nothing. In 133 at-bats - some of them affected by a ligament injury to his right hand, an injury he suffered when he ran into a wall - he had just a .173 average, three home runs, no stolen bases (in zero attempts) and just five walks to go with 39 strikeouts. He did turn heads when he cracked a homer off the facing of the second deck in Oakland, but Rasmus' play largely was nondescript for the Blue Jays.

Because instead, Theron — already tall and slim as a sunflower — just picked herself up, picked another path and got on with it.

What is most impressive is that he has made this transformation without turning his back on any of the "Wrecking Ball" material. Instead, he has channeled the energy of the classic material to the new stuff -- and he is making it all hum and crackle. The Boss continues to stand proudly behind his recent work: Once again, he played eight of the eleven songs on "Wrecking Ball." But rather than dwell on the album's themes of economic hardship, Springsteen has seized on the thread of resurrection that runs through the new set. In rock and roll, the Boss is born again hard, howling out a final, glorious stand against his twin foes: time and mortality.

Set an out-of-towner loose to roam the Los Angeles area between West Hollywood and Koreatown and what can you expect? A food-truck overdose, perhaps.

Fire-safety experts and the electric company suggest the following to avoid Christmas-related disasters connected to common decorations:
In "The Quest," I point to three threats, all of which are very evident. First is Iran and its nuclear program. You see in the Middle East today sort of a proxy battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. You see it in Syria, you see it in Iraq, you see it in Yemen, you see it in Bahrain. The other two things I'd point to is the presence of al-Qaida and the threat of terrorism and with a particular focus on Yemen, which looks pretty much like a failed state and has an 1,100-mile border with Saudi Arabia. The third thing is you still have this huge youth bulge in the Middle East of young people who don't have opportunities, don't have jobs and don't know what their futures will be.

Mann says the timelessness of the play is the ultimate draw. "For me it's always a conflict in our country between the sensitive, delicate, art-loving, tender people and the celebration of the mediocre and the brutish. Tennessee saw it early on. And we're seeing it more and more — just look at our elections. These cruel people with no real sensibility or sensitivity toward others, no appreciation of art or music, culture or women."

Lininger called the measure that requires only the approval of voters within a proposed urban renewal district – which was a last-minute addition to the ballot by county commissioners – a product of listening to community members' concerns about urban renewal. She said a countywide vote for urban renewal decisions would be a "gigantic hurdle" for cities that would prove challenging as they try to attract and keep businesses.
The interior at Coi is as understated as the food and has a serene Japanese feel. The name Coi (pronounced "kwa") is an arcane French word meaning tranquil, the perfect description of the 28-seat dining room.

Model fittings. Maya wants her work to be "dimensional," and prints are so flat. (Eyeroll.) Emilio doesn't think much of Mila's design. "How could someone call themselves a designer, and not work in color?' Mila thinks Antony's taste is questionable. Seth Aaron, who doesn't seem quite as catty about his castmates, just says, "I feel good." He knows his look is totally him. Obviously, because he created the fabric! But he's got a lot of elements in the look and is pushing it until the last second. Anthony, meanwhile, is in a conundrum, worrying how to make his look more complete.

It would transfer some money from Colorado's high-cost support fund and use it for rural broadband expansion. And it would phase out the high-cost fund by 2025. It reallocates money to mesh with modern priorities. But it also has met with resistance from those who receive subsidies to provide rural phone service at lower cost.

Officials at the IOM and CDC are trying to address the societal factors that led the percentage of obese adults to more than double since 1980, when 15 percent were in that category. Among children, it has soared to 17 percent from 5 percent in the past 30 years. One reason: in 1977, children 2 to 18 consumed an average of 1,842 calories per day. By 2006, that had climbed to 2,022.

Then, I found out that wasn’t the case and we just got to build her from the ground up, which was great. I was mostly really excited about doing it because of Will Reiser’s writing, plus the kind of unexpected humor in really honest situations. It wasn’t a cancer movie with dark jokes about cancer.

Our professional caregivers in hospitals, long-term acute care facilities and nursing homes stand in the suffering of others every minute of every day with no preparation or support for the end-of-life experiences they must be present for. The result is more tests and treatments, and the dilemma of when to stop — because there will always be one more.
"Eclipse" (2010): Best of the lot (so far). New director David Slade actually gets more-genuine performances out of the actors, particularly Stewart, and he adds a touch of humor to the heretofore deadly serious proceedings. Bella makes a deal with Edward that she will marry him if he will turn her into a vampire. Jacob is appalled and hurt by this and tries to dissuade her. Meanwhile Bryce Dallas Howard is leading a group of evil vampires who are slaughtering people in nearby Seattle -- and they're coming for Bella. So the vampires and werewolves, whose history of antagonism is explained in a flashback, must team up to protect her. There are a couple of pretty funny lines, such as when Edward, looking at Jacob's famously buff physique, says, "Doesn't he have a shirt?" Later, when Bella is freezing, Edward and Jacob must warm her. Edward's dead, of course, so he's not much help. Jacob moves him aside and says, "Let's face it -- I am hotter than you." The debate over whether that's true is what has fueled the franchise.

New York, NY (Sports Network) - With his team on the brink of elimination, Carmelo Anthony poured in 41 points and the Knicks defeated the Heat, 89-87, in Game 4 of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Amare Stoudemire, who missed Game 3 with an injured left hand which he suffered when he punched a fire extinguisher after a loss in Game 2, returned to the lineup and scored 20 points and grabbed 10 boards to help the Knicks earn their first playoff victory in over a decade. The Knicks had lost an NBA-record 13 straight consecutive playoff games, dating back to April 29, 2001, but still have plenty of work to do as they trail Miami 3-1 in their best-of-seven series. The series returns to Miami for Game 5, which is slated for Wednesday. LeBron James scored 27 points, Dwyane Wade chipped in 22 and Chris Bosh added 17 but the Heat were unable to complete their first series sweep since the second round of the 2005 playoffs against the Washington Wizards.

But this is Los Angeles, where you hear a hundred different languages on the streets and smell the cooking of a thousand different food cultures, a city so diverse that the study of postmodern urbanism is often called the L.A. School for short, a city where it is possible not only to discover a new dish on an evening out but also an entirely new cuisine.

One obvious answer is that individuals who join the all-volunteer military have to expect they will be assigned as military circumstances dictate. Another is that with the U.S. military stretched thin in two wars, for more than a decade in Afghanistan and nearly as long in Iraq, multiple combat deployments have been inevitable.
“Right now, I’m a little bothered about leaving Jersey,’’ said Brooks, a rookie shooting guard from Providence College. “We lost. We didn’t really finish like we wanted to down the stretch. But you know, Brooklyn-ready. I’ve got a long offseason ahead to think about before playing in Brooklyn.’’

DeLillo meant to explore a different history in "Underworld"; he was writing about the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, after all. Still, the larger point remains. We mark time by the exploits of athletes, from Thomson's half-century-old heroics to Kirk Gibson's pumping his fists after hitting his 1988 World Series blast against the Oakland A's. We take our memories and enshrine them, creating personal halls of fame. And when recollection fails us, there are always photographs, keeping history immediate, as if nothing were ever really lost.

The give-and-take, which officials said was more heated in public than in private, set the terms for the final debate on yet another of Obama's priorities. The president is hoping the Senate acts quickly and passes a bill that can be easily reconciled with legislation that passed the House in December. But Democrats need at least one Republican to overcome procedural hurdles and the looming question was whether the administration and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would simply seek to pick off Republican senators or build a coalition through bipartisan negotiations.
"I was hoping to become more educated about what happened during the Kevin Kelley era," said Graham, who was working in another district when Kelley was taking bribes and steering district business to contractors.

All of this made me look sideways at reaction to the news that women often pay more than men of the same age for the same plan. Some states, including Oregon and Washington, have outlawed what is called "gender rating," and beginning in 2014, the federal health care law will also prohibit it. But right now, the National Women's Law Center says its research shows that in states that haven't banned gender rating, some 90 percent of the best-selling health plans charge women more than men.

Blame unseasonably warm temperatures, which have triggered trees into reproductive mode weeks earlier than usual, sending pollen — a fine dust that comes from the male parts of a flower or plant — into people’s sinuses.
For one, net migration from Mexico to the United States has come to a standstill as the number of people trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has fallen off and many immigrants have opted to return to their countries amid this country's ongoing economic woes. Moreover, while immigration reform and deportation rules are still very pertinent issues, the battles are being fought more in courtrooms and legislative halls than in the streets.

Over the course of the past eight weeks residents against drilling have been vocal both at council meetings and via e-mails sent to city officials.
The thinking: Barring a top-15 talent like, say, Mark Barron sliding, Kirkpatrick is the best option if he's available in the first round. He's big and physical, and the Lions have a glaring need at cornerback. David could come off the board earlier, but free agency showed how the value of linebackers has slipped. Still, he's a playmaker. Polk fills a hole on offense.
But where Disneyland's Indy takes riders through a three-dimensional environment, Transformers settles for a series of 3-D movie scenes. And while both Transformers and Star Tours could be described as a 3-D movie with a motion simulator, the new Universal ride is far more immersive and engaging than the rebooted Disneyland attraction.
When it comes to the death penalty, one mistake is one mistake too many. And if we're looking to save taxpayer money, we should abolish the death penalty. Most of those expensive appeals would evaporate if convicted murderers were sentenced to life without parole.

Still, there are major financial hurdles. The state slashed $536 million in aid to transit lines across California in the current budget, and future cuts may be deeper. BART faces a $250 million deficit over the next five years, Caltrain may declare a fiscal emergency as its operating funds dry up, and San Francisco Muni is staring at a $129 million shortfall. The VTA expects to lose $79 million in state funds over the next two years, a gap it plans to make up for by using cash reserves, hiking fares, reducing service and cutting employees' wages and benefits.

When minors commit acts of sexual abuse, the results are not only tragic but also confusing. The legal system is built to respond to adult offenders, and lawmakers often are at a loss when it comes to responding to child-on-child sex crimes. For instance, should a 9-year-old perpetrator be on the sex offender registry? And what would cause a child to engage in this criminal behavior, particularly at such a young age?

Don: What is going to be done about crime? When people would rather "play it safe" and spend entertainment dollars in their counties rather than the city, that stops businesses from wanting to go there.

"It's an odd spot to find yourself in," he said. "You want to cover the story and let people know what went on, but when I heard all those sirens, my heart just dropped.
