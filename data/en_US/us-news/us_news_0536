Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, 750 East 88th St., Cleveland, 216-664-3103: It's lily time at the city of Cleveland's free greenhouse. The Easter show is in full bloom even though the holiday is still a few weeks away. Gorgeous white, orange, pink and yellow flowers are bursting open daily. They alone are worth a visit, but that's far from everything on display. Young visitors should enjoy the large cactus garden and huge orange tree inside. Outside, the tranquil Japanese and Peace gardens should intrigue visitors of all ages (though they are a little sparse now), as should the Betty Ott Talking Garden for sight-impaired visitors. On your way there, don't forget to look out the window for a glimpse of one of Cleveland's unique treasures, the 25-plus cultivated cultural gardens on 50 acres of East Boulevard and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive between Lake Erie and University Circle. Opened in 1916, the area is an ideal place to soak up spring -- and learn more about Cleveland's diverse cultural history.
Reportedly, illegal abortions during her starlet years had left her badly scarred; later, books would write of miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy. But there were no stories at the time. Not only were stars more circumspect, but sexuality still equaled fertility; a love goddess who couldn’t reproduce was a cruel joke.

Favorite breakfast: Ken's House of Pancakes. A laid-back local favorite that personifies all the best qualities of the east side of the Big Island: fun, unpretentious, inexpensive and good. Macadamia nut pancakes are the big draw, though the voluminous menu – said to be the biggest on the Big Island – has Japanese, Chinese and Hawaiian favorites, along with normal coffee shop fare. The good food is served by waitresses who exude brash, friendly "tutu" (grandma) attitude. It's open 24 hours a day and is almost always crowded.

When we did our preview of the 15 biggest games of 2012, only one (“FIFA 13”) did not involve carrying around a gun or a sword.

Not because it’s causing people to become mass murderers, but simply because there’s more to storytelling and imagination than death-dealing. How could it hurt?

A couple of years ago, some friends bought a vacation house in the mountains. It needed work - e.g., a swath of exterior wall needed to be re-sided where a tenant, using a charcoal grill on the deck, had managed to melt a section of vinyl siding. My theory: Because most people's expectations of exterior walls are formed by long acquaintance with wood, brick and stucco, they just don't expect exterior walls to melt. Even if, on some level, they're aware that they're dealing with walls clad in vinyl siding, which they know to be meltable, it doesn't occur to them to take precautions to avoid melting it.

An intense process of getting to know every season ticket and suite holder as well as corporate sponsors. The goal was to find out how the team could enhance the experience of a game in ways Wright and his staff could control.

Our leaders for generations have known home ownership is about much more than money. They know homeowners have always been the foundation of our communities. Homeowners have a stake in the future of their communities because they have been the builders of our communities. They are the "old lady" across the street who called your parents if you got out of hand and also the first person you called if you were in trouble. They are the coach who taught your kid's soccer team. They are the guy who came to your door with a petition to help improve your neighborhood. Communities where home ownership rates are high are strong because homeowners are there to stay and build a future for their families.
The main website was down for about 24 hours, until the church moved its servers to an outside hosting company. The church then hired another company to divert traffic coming from the attackers. Nazario measured 488 attacks by individuals on Jan. 19, the longest of which lasted almost two hours.

Interest in the music of the Polish-born Russian composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg has revived over the past couple of years, since the emergence of his 1968 Holocaust-themed opera "The Passenger." Now comes a new collection of gritty and fascinating works - the first installment of a projected complete cycle of Weinberg's piano music - that can only accelerate the process. Weinberg, who died in 1996, was a friend and protege of Shostakovich's, and the influence of the older composer suffuses this music - especially the Sonata No. 1, which boasts some of the same angular rhythms, tart dissonances and mournful expressivity. But Weinberg's harmonic language, as well as his taste for spirited fantasy, is distinctive, and there is an ambitious quality to the last piece here - a sonatina expanded 25 years later into a full-scale sonata - that is irresistible. Completeness means we also get some teenage works that are slim but utterly charming. Allison Brewster Franzetti plays it all with fervor and appealing commitment.

Sure, Woods won in 2001 with that "better than most" 60-foot birdie putt on the island-green 17th in the third round, and he was runner-up to Hal Sutton in 2000. But he has had just two other finishes in the top 10 at The Players Championship, and the last two years were particularly troubling.

Although it's really meant to be a drive-through experience, I recently spent an hour, 6 to 7 p.m., with a muy sugary sweet lemonade inside a South Austin Taco Bell. I will say, no offense, it brought on a strange motel-like experience. The music: Elton John, Natalie Merchant, Carly Simon, Bob Seger. The patrons: a fat, graying, kind-looking white guy with a baseball cap and a mentally disabled Mexican American he clearly took care of, who was probably the same age, give or take. A very fat black couple. A way fat Mexican American guy alone. A Mexican American mom, a little heavy, and her cute, overweight daughter who went to refill her oil-drum-sized soda cup before they left. A family walked in, or what seemed like one: Mexican American, a mom and her three big teenage sons. Only one of the boys carried a lot of soft belly; the others might just be called big kids. They were laughing, happy, which resonated in the punishing stillness that had been there. Just because that Taco Bell advertising push has driven me insane, I approached the cashier who sold me my drink—a scrawny white teenager with black-rimmed glasses—as he came near to pull out the full trash bag and replace it with a new plastic liner. I asked him to tell me what a chalupa was.

Taxes. If you hold an investment in a taxable account, something other than 401(k)s or IRAs, for example, you could be hit with paying capital gains taxes on a fund's annual distributions. Whether you're in an index fund or an ETF, chances are the fund's index-investing approach helps shield investors from capital gains. An index fund doesn't buy or sell its holdings as frequently as actively managed funds move in and out of stocks or bonds. So it's less likely to trigger a tax hit for shareholders. However, because of the way ETFs are structured, they tend to have more tools at their disposal than index funds to limit taxes.
