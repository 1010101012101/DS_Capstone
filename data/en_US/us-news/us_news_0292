“I understand the city is strapped,” Solomon said, “but the city nickels and dimes everybody to death anyway, and one of the benefits of living in a city is that there are street fairs that introduce the community to one another.

On the second try, I just let 'er rip: selective, judgmental and to the degree that such a book could be, colloquial — like I am. "Sunshine Muse" included the lyrical installation artist Connie Zehr but not the lyrical installation artist Lita Albuquerque; it said outright that Mark Tobey and Morris Graves "have possessed Pacific Northwest art to the point of suffocation"; and it described Ed Ruscha's late-'60s paintings of the illusions of words made of poured liquids "as when the bespectacled boy-genius drops his secret fluid and it poofs into a genii."
Over and over. Man after man.

Never mind that Jordan might have won six NBA championships in Portland, amplified his Nike footprint by being in the sneaker company's backyard, and maybe, ended up buying a Major League Baseball team and moving it to Portland.

But then you figure there's only so many screens that show off-Hollywood movies, and there's only 52 weeks in the year. And that's not going to change.

But why now, we wondered. Its provenance was already debated a year ago, when an appearance in a Jay-Z video after his high-profile dumping of Roederer's Cristal led to the revelation that it was a new brand created by Champagne firm Cattier using a long-dormant name. As several writers noted, the bottle resembled a less expensive Cattier bottling, Antique Gold. Also odd was the wine's composition of one-third Pinot Meunier, a grape rarely found in top cuvees, certainly not those approaching $300. Odder still is a nonvintage blend at that price; even the fearless Krug keeps its Grande Cuvee well under $200.

In the film stills, Sherman smartly fused a searching, feminist sensibility with the consciousness of a heavy consumer of media culture. From here on, Sherman created her work in-studio (working alone, sans assistants), borrowing liberally (like her peers within the so-called Pictures generation) from given idioms of film, television and magazines to further probe the notion of the protean, socially constructed self.

6. Around the World in 80 Days (1956): I have nothing against the winning film, but the Texas epic "Giant" would have been a far better choice. This would be my No. 1 travesty of Oscar justice had the Academy even bothered to nominate "The Searchers," one of my three all-time faves and the greatest western of all time. (So, wait for it whenever I get around to doing an "Oscar snub" list.)

Advocates for the poor say hunger continues to be a growing problem, particularly for those with children. "If you are lucky enough to have a job, you have seen your wages stagnate.

TR: I definitely started a lot earlier. I took from what I did last offseason, looked back at it, saw how I felt when I came in, and made some modifications off of that. I felt like I had to start a little bit earlier once the season got over as far as weight training, and that schedule. I started throwing a lot earlier. I took a break early. Then I started throwing again to prepare for spring training. I dialed-up the mental focus and I started getting off a mound before coming down here because I knew once I got here there wasn't going to be much time to fill it out. I needed to start clicking right away.

Jewsbury's ability to live up to the role of captain on a young team shows why management made the move to acquire him during preseason.

If exclusively green gardens are architectural, somewhat intellectual and constructed of contrasting proportions, shapes and leaf textures, then colorful gardens are decidedly festive, emotional and difficult to pull off. A garden with many colors all smashed in together can have the effect of a psychedelic album cover from the 1960s: riveting, chaotic and a bit cornball. The beauty of a lavender rosebush is sure to be KO'd by a patch of orange nasturtiums and scarlet cannas showboating nearby. Throw in a couple of hot-pink sweet pea vines and a clump of sunflowers, and you've exhausted the color wheel for good.

Lowe then got Kinsler to ground out, keeping it 2-0.

How about using your miles for non-travel purchases, as some airlines now urge? The reason is simple: You realize even less value than using your miles for travel.

Just as importantly, so are its feet -- the dancing, by newcomer Kenny Wormald and two-time "Dancing with the Stars" winner Julianne Hough, is outstanding. It is not a great movie by any stretch, but it's a ... nice one. And if "nice" is often critic code for damning with faint praise, that's not really the case here. You'll forget the details of the plot five minutes after you leave the theater, but you'll have the tunes -- some remakes of songs from the original, others new -- stuck in your head for some time to come. And you might even tap your foot a little while you're at it.

Over the course of Obama's campaign, first against Hillary Clinton and then against John McCain, his race was too often treated by the chattering class of pundits and prognosticators (myself included) as a strategic consideration for his and his opponents as they mapped their respective paths to victory: whether Obama could attract the support of white voters, how he could convince Latino Americans to switch their allegiance from Hillary Clinton to himself and, most notoriously, whether and how he would distance himself from the rantings of his former preacher. But because the mainstream media tend to overemphasize the horse race aspects of a presidential campaign, it was too easy for us armchair analysts to miss what the activists and advocates on the front lines of this election season were seeing all along.

Next, let's examine the elimination of political opposition. Kasich stated even before he took office that his goal was "to break the backs of the teachers unions." Senate Bill 5, which was passed shortly after Kasich took office, was an attempt to do exactly that. In the entire Issue 2 campaign last fall, supporters of Senate Bill 5 never even attempted to provide an explanation of how the elimination of collective bargaining rights would be best for kids. Nationwide, the bottom 10 states on standardized test scores are "right to work" (nonunion) states, while the top 10 are states that allow teachers unions, collective bargaining and management rights. Despite these facts, Mitt Romney wants a national right-to-work law. Is his goal to do what's best for kids or to do what's best for eliminating political opposition? Likewise, if elimination of political opposition is not a factor in Jackson's and Kasich's Cleveland Plan, then why are they not willing to accept the plan submitted by the Cleveland Teachers Union, which is almost identical to theirs except for the preservation of collective bargaining rights?

Kasich, a former congressman, accuses Strickland of doing too little to lessen Ohio's tax burden. Strickland blames Bush-era policies and Wall Street greed for Ohio's grief.

One irony: Some of the targeted schools were among the several dozen that in the last few months have voluntarily shared more detailed survey data with Law School Transparency, a nonprofit advocacy group founded in 2009 by two Vanderbilt law students. Those numbers show how many of the reported jobs were in the legal field and how many respondents didn't report their salaries. The figures have aided some suits against these schools. "We've used that," said David Anziska, a New York attorney who has co-filed most of the suits.

The District Attorney's Office said Stanley befriended an elderly San Jose man in a Post Office parking lot in 2007 and they eventually got engaged while she pretended to be in love with him. Along the way, she swindled him out of $236,000 by claiming her two children needed money for operations, even though they were healthy. After being discovered, prosecutors seized the money from Stanley's bank account and restored the victim's life savings to him.

8. Gladiator (2000): I know the sword-and-sandal crowd will hate me including this film, and it (like most of the movies on this list) was at least a solid effort.

But something or someone has to give somewhere. Initially, perhaps it will be Matt D'Agostini, with his nine goals, 17 points and plus-13 rating. The good news is, the Blues haven't been a position in recent years to move a creditable player down the chain, to have a legitimate competition.

"My Super Ex-Girlfriend" stars Uma Thurman as Jenny Johnson, a k a G-Girl, a neurotically needy superhero. The movie was directed, with all the finesse of a junior high school pageant, by Ivan Reitman. (Yes, the same Ivan Reitman who directed "Ghost Busters.") Luke Wilson is steadfastly bland in the role of Matt Saunders, a regular guy who can't deal with Jenny's insecurities There's a funny idea here, but you might not know it from Don Payne's script, or, for that matter, from Ms. Thurman's performance, which serves as an unintended tribute to Quentin Tarantino, who used her so effectively in the two volumes of "Kill Bill."

The first time we played together, I warned her, "Don't take Boston," explaining that even a virtual Yankees-Red Sox matchup with my own child could bring out the cold-bloodedness in me. Sure enough, that's exactly what happened. During the game, in a digital Fenway Park, I tried to keep it friendly, throwing her the occasional meatball, letting her score some runs. But in the eighth inning, with the Yankees leading by three, she hit a two-run homer to bring the Red Sox within one. I looked at her as she did a dance of joy; I might have even said, "Now, it's serious." Then, I did what any real Yankees fan would do: I went to the bullpen for Mariano Rivera, and I shut my daughter down.

Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday met with 10 police chiefs who object to the law, and he promised them he would act on the recommendations "soon," a spokesman said. The police chiefs urged him and the Obama administration, which has reservations about the Arizona law, to stop it from going into effect because they said it would seriously hamper local police work if officers are asked to serve as border police.
If nothing else, the poll indicates how unsettled an already volatile campaign remains. Polls last week showed Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had grabbed a lead nationally and in Michigan following a three-state sweep of Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri the week before.

"I was shocked to learn that Oregon had no recourse for a victim in this situation," Starr wrote. "This bill makes sense and serves to protect the privacy, peace of mind and emotional healing of rape victims." He goes on to explain that he introduced SB522 at the request of a constituent. The constituent was a rape victim who went to court in an attempt to terminate the parental rights of her offender and the father of her child. Unfortunately, Starr's release said, the court's hands were tied. SB522 fixes that and gives courts something to stand on when denying rapists inappropriate interaction with their victims and the young children of those victims.

However the players, who were given three days to appeal, may have significant hurdles to overcome. The collective bargaining agreement signed after last summer's lockout essentially makes Goodell judge and jury for matters pertaining to the integrity of the game. Since this case technically falls under the umbrella of off-field conduct, the players can't appeal to anyone but the commissioner per the CBA's bylaws and may have difficulty getting the case in front of an outside judge.

It's not that simple, of course. In overwhelmingly Democratic Cuyahoga County, few Republicans have a chance in a countywide election. Consequently, the county GOP usually offered the three only tacit opposition, and sometimes none at all. The one time the Republicans did run a substantial candidate, Wise in 1998, he was armed with a devastating state audit against Russo and editorial support from The Plain Dealer -- and he got 40 percent of the vote.
In interviews, and in response to email inquiries about how they are deciding, a number of Republican voters and analysts explained a continuum playing out primary by primary.

A decade of growth across much of Europe initially followed the 1999 introduction of the euro, seeming to vindicate the promise that closer European integration would beget prosperity.

People in Portland need the Blazers to get it together. Healthy or not, as a region, we're not diversified and are overly reliant upon the NBA franchise. Think about it. The weather October through April can be tough. It's gray. It's dreary. It rains. We go inside during those months, and look to the Blazers to help get us through the winter. They become sunlight.

Imagine a tree, a living, miniature olive tree, whose branches bear heavy, golden fruit shining like poisoned apples in the late-afternoon sun. The tree is a bonsai of sorts, gnarled and thick-trunked, rooted in a vessel that appears to have been fashioned from the earth itself. Not without difficulty, a man in a dark suit heaves it onto your table. You understand without being told that you are to pluck one of the glittery orbs and pop it into your mouth. Its skin, crisp and brittle, shatters under your teeth, releasing a complex brine, all ocean, sugar and decay, which fades to a subtly penetrating bittersweetness that lingers until it is washed away with a sip of cold wine. Does the substance of the fruit matter? The moment is sublime.
Revenge helped inspire "Where the Wild Things Are," his canonical tale of the boy Max's mind in flight in a forest of monsters, who just happen to look like some of Sendak's relatives from childhood.

I wonder if, at the moment of the patent clerk's pen stroke 6,000 miles away, the people in 1886 Los Angeles didn't feel the wind change.

Nearly 240 workers were evacuated a week ago from Total's Elgin platform, 240 kilometers (150 miles) off the Scottish coast, when the gas leak was found.

Manning said he hadn’t given any thought to where he might end up, but even if that’s true, you’d have to think he’d crave the stability he had for all those years in Indianapolis. It’s something the Jets lack, as their interest in Manning proves once again.
I've been playing around with computers for my entire adult life. I once spent four hours networking 16 computers together so I could play computer games with friends for less than an hour. My basement at home has enough spare parts to build at least two wildly outdated computers.
If the film sounds halfway decent in print, maybe it's because we haven't gotten to the part when Marley goes to heaven and meets Whoopi Goldberg, dressed in white, playing God. If you ever caught the episode of "Designing Women" in which Dolly Parton was Charlene's Guardian Movie Star, you get the gist.

Grandview def. Westminster, 25-9, 25-9, 25-6
A: Since they're essentially locked into no worse than the No. 2 seed, I would consider it now. I think the Heat, though, will wait at least until after Thursday's visit to Chicago, so they can get a true measure of where they stand. Having Mike Miller back also will make it easier to cycle down on the minutes of the regulars. Still, Erik Spoelstra said after Friday's debacle it wouldn't happen. To me, this season is different than any other, and to fail to adjust is shortsighted. Essentially, Erik called out not the media, but Gregg Popovich after Friday's game, considering the way Popovich has been handling his players during this scheduling grinder.
Living in an increasingly secular, pluralistic, post-modern, post-Christian, post-you-name-it world, this message is certainly not accepted by everyone. It wasn't during the time of the New Testament church either.
He operated like a quasi-cult leader, convincing teams that they could pull off improbable feats simply because he expected it of them. And he was vindictive. Because he thought Google poached on iPhone to create its Android, he told Isaacson, "I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this."
QUESTION: What do you think the Rams will do in this year's draft now that they've traded down to No. 6 and picked up additional picks? Will they package some of those picks to trade up and grab WR Justin Blackmon, will they cross their fingers and hope that Blackmon drops to them at No. 6 or just take the best available player at that spot, or, do you think it's possible that they'll trade down even farther in an attempt to collect as many draft picks as possible as they look to restock this roster?
Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in Warsaw on Monday that if Hollande asks for growth-promoting additions to the treaty, it could help its cause in Ireland and Dublin would support him. But he said his government was concerned that a critical stance by Hollande could hurt support for the treaty in Ireland.
Joyce said Davis met with White for a few minutes after the shareholders' meeting and that other bank employees have called her since then. They've walked White through her file, he said, and given some new information to Freddie Mac. As of late Wednesday, no deals have been made.
The exchange would include the Oregon Health Plan, which would be open to anyone under 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Those with incomes between 138 percent and 400 percent of poverty level would qualify for federal tax credits to subsidize the cost of their health premiums. The poverty level is $22,350 for a family of four.
When a deputy pulled up behind a car pulled onto the shoulder of Highway 94 near South Breeze Drive on March 4, he noticed a male alongside urinating on the grass. The 55-year-old man was arrested for public indecency. He also was found to have a small amount of marijuana in his possession.

Discount airlines say that bigger rivals may well end up with higher prices than theirs when the holidays are closer. When Delta, American, US Airways and United offer lower prices, it's typically because they have a lot more seats to sell in a particular market and they don't believe they can fill airplanes at full-fare prices.

Spain's PMI showed conditions in the country's manufacturing sector deteriorated sharply again in April, with the third consecutive monthly decrease in the index.
Technologically, the system is a marvel. There are no tollbooths. Indeed, there is no sign at all that this is a toll road except for actual signs that say so. The toll is collected in myriad ways. You can sign up for an account and get a little coded sticker for your windshield. Or you can wait until they bill you, using your license plate to track you down. Apparently, it works. Unless your commute is between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., in which case it's free, you can't escape.

Even with bus and truck drivers, nuclear plant workers, and others in jobs that the federal government deems "safety sensitive," employers are required to test for only six categories of drugs that do not cover synthetic painkillers like OxyContin and Vicodin, anti-anxiety drugs like Xanax, or other controlled prescription drugs. (Because the test looks for codeine and morphine, which experts say are far less abused than the synthetics, many employers wrongly assume it looks for all opiates.)
County voters last year overwhelmingly approved the charter that will replace the three elected commissioners with an elected executive and 11 elected council members. On Sept. 7, residents in each district will vote in primaries for council and a county executive.
The mourning also reaches Safford, where residents of a city 10,000 are also devastated by the victims' deaths.

The Los Angeles Times determined we have 114 separate and distinct neighborhoods here in Los Angeles. The city has posted several hundred blue signs naming far more. L.A. is a mash-up of uncountable, diverse neighborhoods spread over 465 square miles; hard and soft, painted in colors from concrete gray and security bar black to putting lawn green and jacaranda snowfall purple; beautiful, mysterious, dangerous, welcoming neighborhoods, soundtracked by the music of more languages than you or I or even the Los Angeles Times can count.
The housing market still has a long way to go before a full recovery is under way. The current pace of construction is barely half the rate considered healthy, as are the number of permits being requested. Most analysts say it could be years before the industry returns to full health.

So my Tigers were playing the Angels and a guy by the name of Nolan Ryan was pitching for them. All I knew about him at the time was he was leading the league in strikeouts. He threw great that day and I was so mad at him because the Angels won (6-0), he struck out 17 Tigers and threw a no-hitter. How dare he ruin my first in-person Tiger game and a great father-son day. Also during the game, in the bottom of the ninth, Norm Cash came to bat (he had already struckout in each of his previous plate appearances). He stepped in the batters box and got in his stance, the umpire called time and started talking to Norm. Norm came back to the dugout and soon returned to the batters box, he popped out to end the game. It wasnt until we were in the car driving home and listening to Ernie Harwell and Paul Carey doing the postgame show on WJR that we learned Norm initially came to bat with a table leg he broke off from a clubhouse table; the umpire noticed it and called time and told Norm he had to get a real bat, and Norm replied Whats it matter, I haven't hit a pitch yet today! Oh, we laughed for awhile in the car hearing that. He was a character.
Environmental and animal welfare groups that wrote and passed the ballot measure in 1990 banning lion hunting argued that the practice is cruel and unnecessary, because unlike with deer, turkeys and other game, hunters do not eat lions. And they argued it upsets the balance of predators and prey. Hunting groups attempted to overturn the measure in 1996, but voters again chose to keep lion hunting illegal.

Among philanthropists, the Arnolds are the polar opposite of check-writers who are happy to support a good cause and happier still if their name ends up on the side of a building. In an article last year in the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the couple described how they decided to no longer engage in "mutual fund" giving, in which money is given across the spectrum to a wide group of worthy non-profits. Instead, they began to focus their efforts in specific areas that interested them and do their most to make a difference, which meant personal involvement.

Harris, a former All-Star point guard, and Favors, the No. 3 pick in the draft, were part of the package the Nets were offering the Nuggets all season for Anthony. While they couldn’t get Denver’s All-Star forward, Wednesday’s trade stole some of the spotlight from the rival Knicks on the night Anthony arrives at Madison Square Garden.
Incidentally, Cox doesn't buy Thrifty's explanation. She says that no one handed her a brochure when she rented her car, and no one offered to let her pay for any tolls retroactively.

It was déjÀ vu all over again when Karl arrived at our house and tossed me the keys. He still had a great fondness for his original Porsche.

Chances are, you both had baby-related plots brewing in your heads. You maybe thought you’d ignore the issue and it might go away. Your wife maybe figured she’d get pregnant, you’d just have to go along, and the moment you saw the baby you'd melt into a loving father. But, whoops, fertility issues crept in. You can get accidentally pregnant, but you can’t accidentally adopt a child, as in, you’re driving along one day, glance into the back seat and notice a 6-year-old Romanian orphan coloring on the headrest.

In the spring of 2008, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination got nasty too. The front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Barack Obama, was "a lot of talk, no action," and charged that Obama wasn't qualified to lead in a crisis. Obama responded with television advertisements that accused Clinton of "the old politics of phony charges and false attacks," and his aides accused Clinton's husband of trying to play the race card.

The federal health-care plan for legislators is a pretty nice deal, with the federal government offering a broad array of plans while paying an average of $700 per month - about 75 percent of the cost. When the cost of the plans goes up, the government subsidy goes up. No member can be refused because of a pre-existing condition. Meanwhile, for the rest of us, more and more employers don't offer health care at all - and those that do are demanding that employees pay an ever-increasing percentage of the premiums and co-pays. And it is Obama's reforms that these legislators want to repeal that require insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of pre-existing illnesses.
