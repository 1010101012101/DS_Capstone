As with any fractured relationship, there's probably too much posturing here borne mostly out of misunderstanding. Angelos likely isn't as nefarious as fans make him out to be -- he just wants to make money, they shout -- and the fans aren't as ungrateful or uneducated or unworthy of contact as maybe Angelos and his top advisers might think.

I have my list - though "outrage" seems the wrong term; my thermostat is set too low. So let's say "deep concern." Where to begin? The corruption of Congress. The triviality of the electoral process. Refusal to reform the immigration system. The use of religion to gild senseless bigotries and pretend they're acceptable. I could go on, but you get the idea.

The political appeal of Romney-Rice is obvious. Here are two seasoned and reassuring presences who seem to complement each other in all the right ways.

I began to worry when I got dizzy and nauseated, but those sensations subsided as I realized I had one of the biggest tourist attractions in the world almost to myself. In the five hours it took to reach the rim, I saw eight people.
Still, the controversy over the Morphosis design has had the secondary effect of redefining the KieranTimberlake entry as generic and unimaginative. And this is, if not entirely unfair, then at least based on a limited definition of architecture and architectural symbolism.
The epicenter of the market tensions, however, was in Greece, analysts said.
"I saw a guy at my last base who was the same height as me, but much bigger and it didn't look right," he said. "I would like to drop to 165 pounds, so I do low weights with high repetition now."

"I thought it went great considering it was the first year," said Harris, who also played for Detroit and Atlanta during a six-year NFL career. "Someone on the outside looking in might have thought we'd been doing it for a couple years. I think the kids had a great time. They came out and competed, and it was good to see all that talent under one roof."
The service, always a strength here, vacillated between precise and forgetful. We had to ask twice for a spoon because the one that came with the short ribs had fallen into the soup. Between courses, the waiter placed soiled chopsticks back on the table.

Wednesday, Oct. 12: Warring events tonight. If your tastes favor the metaphysical, you might want to head to Berkeley and watch Deepak Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow duke it out over the future of God. If you're willing to let them settle the issue without you, then your best bet is the Barbary Coast Award presentation. Each year Litquake honors a local literary luminary, and this year's recipient is poet, playwright, essayist and jazz musician Ishmael Reed. Expect the evening to be a mash-up of music, comedy, readings and dramatic performance.
Darren Taylor, Sac Metro assistant fire chief, said fire crews found the body of one of the home's residents. The elderly victim's name was not released.

Metro Atlanta employees who responded to Workplace Dynamics’ top workplace survey were shown a list of 20 statements, grouped into six categories. They were asked the importance of each statement while rating their places of work.
And that is that the buildings that make up Neway Stamping, which Dick and his cousin Ted Hlavaty founded almost 40 years ago, are also pristine. It's something you rarely see in an industrial complex full of machines capable of stamping parts out of quarter-inch-thick tempered steel. My kitchen floor has more dirt and grime than the concrete floor in the blanking room.
In a letter to Wal-Mart CEO Michael Duke, the Baltimore Democrat says he is opening an investigation into allegations raised in a story over the weekend by The New York Times and asked the company to schedule a meeting with lawmakers to discuss the issue by Friday.

In a county that has roughly 51,000 chronically homeless people — more than any other in the nation — it is only right that some Section 8 vouchers should go to those in acute need. Ex-cons who qualify for the homeless set-aside vouchers are among the most desperate. But they are also supervised and working on changing lives addled by drugs, crime, homelessness, mental illness or some combination of all that. If they have served their sentences and put two years between themselves and a jail cell, does it make sense to deny them assistance? The set-aside program is about identifying those most in need of housing and giving them priority.

Gillard has been at the helm of the city's vendors board for the last 15 years. Over the past five years, the number of licensed street vendors in Baltimore has more than doubled, Gillard said. He chalks up the increase, from about 20 vendors in 2005, to the down economy — people trying to stay afloat without a typical 9-to-5 job.
My experience is that every Pulitzer finalist is a tribute to the profession, an example of exemplary work that crystallized or changed the course of human events. It's excruciatingly hard to get from eight, seven, six to a final three. This year's finalists produced editorials that offered a prescription for the European debt crisis (Bloomberg News), changed a governor's behavior (Tampa Bay Times) and led to a state's first reform of open government laws in 35 years (Burlington (Vt.) Free Press). I salute them all, even as I know it is no consolation.

Allen: Turgeon's first official recruit in College Park looks to be much like what was missing with the Terps last season -- a point guard who makes good decisions with the ball and doesn't try to make a highlight play every time down the court. Maybe Allen was holding back some after getting banged up a few times the past year, but he appears to be a pretty good athlete and, even in the shoot-first setting of a high-octane pickup game, someone who looks to get his teammates involved. I can see Allen being used initially much the same way Adrian Bowie was used during his first three years at Maryland while playing behind Greivis Vasquez and Eric Hayes.
The potato gnocchi ($18) seemed ill conceived; fortunately, that dish is not on the current menu. I ordered it because the combination looked interesting - Brussels sprouts, pancetta and tarragon; however, there was way too much meat, which says something when you're an addict like I am.
The strategy is known as "attrition through enforcement," and it is a factor behind every one of the anti-illegal-immigration laws passed so far, said Kavanagh, a main supporter of the bill and a criminal-justice professor at Scottsdale Community College.

Despite a record-setting college career, many NFL draft analysts describe Weeden as slow-footed and question his ability to escape a pass rush. They wonder whether he'll be able to grasp the footwork to transition from his college offense to the pros.
He went on, "The car raced by me going (estimated) 100+ mph. Then I noticed there was a series of performance cars (Porsches, Ferraris, etc.) that were following the lead police car with their blinkers on and license plates taped off — speeding at the same high rate. I noticed that many cars were struggling to get out of their way safely."

"It's open," McMillan said. "You can't finesse that ball. You've got to dunk it. When you're going in, you dunk it or you attempt to dunk it. Especially when you have an open drive like that. You put the pressure on the officials to make the call. You've got to power that."

The term brick and motar, a business that has a physical presence, came about in the late 1990's when dot-commers wanted a way to separate themselves from merchants who operated outside the online world. That phrase is still used today.
SPRICK: And then there are people like me who are 49 with no kids and never been married, and they look at you and say, "Well, you live on the Plaza. You're either gay or there's something wrong with you because you've never been married, so you're not a good prospect, anyway." All these years I was a 30-something dating a 20-something, and people would ask why I would do that, and I'd say because I can. The stupid thing about that, all of a sudden you move outside of that age and you can't. It's a timing thing. Right place, right time.
The two scientists spoke to The Associated Press as part of a European Union initiative, called Clamer, to collate and publicize information from 300 EU-funded research projects conducted over the last 13 years on climate change and marine ecology. Rabe and colleagues from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, published their research last year in the journal Deep Sea Research on the effects of higher river runoff on ocean salinity.
"Raising tuition on local resident students to increase our profile nationally just doesn't make sense to me," Brod said. "I have a very strong concern about that tuition increase."
Katie is by far the easiest dog one could ever hope for! She never barks, loves going on walks, loves hanging out in the backyard with us, quietly relaxes on her dog beds whenever we're inside, takes treats extremely gently, and sleeps peacefully at the foot of our bed at night. She is easy mannered and while still very timid, she is making progress almost daily. When Katie first arrived she was so terrified of the world that she refused to leave her crate, could not be safely walked on leash, and trying to pet her caused her to freeze in panic. She was terrified of everything from the sound of dry food being scooped into her bowl to the sight of passing cars. Now, two months later, she greets us with a soft wagging tail when we get home, whimpers ever so softly if I leave the backyard without taking her with me, tries to get us to play chase with her in the backyard, and falls asleep at night resting her chin on our legs. She endearingly cocks her head sideways when you talk to her, loves going on car rides, and pays attention to everything going on around her, which is helping her figure out the world is a pretty good place!
Come October, the Knollwood SuperTarget and 1,764 other locations (plus Target.com) will feature the Nate Berkus Collection -- more than 150 home products painstakingly designed by Berkus himself, including bedding, bath, accessories, lighting, rugs and window treatments.

All of which, director Mike Bondi says, represents the research center's ground-level connection with farmers and nursery operators in seven north valley counties. "This is the nerve center," he says.
It's hard to loot a paid-up electric bill or to steal a bigger apartment, so looters took what was within reach, from a box of Tide to an aquarium or a dozen guns, all booty from the riots. (My late colleague George Ramos learned that some young Latino men who had gleefully looted the Sears store near downtown got home and were told by their parents to turn right around, young man, and take that back.)
During the offseason, the Bears can start by addressing the offensive line, a unit that struggled throughout the season and in Sunday's title game.
Unlike rivals such as Apple, Microsoft has relied mainly on partners to create hardware that runs its software, though there have been exceptions to that pattern such as the Xbox videogame unit and the company's ill-fated Zune media player. Another move by Microsoft that could be seen as competition to hardware makers—such as those planning tablet devices around Windows 8—could cause tension with the company's customers.

The exchange’s main electronic trading platform will be moved into a facility known as NY4, an otherwise anonymous warehouse that sits alongside Secaucus Road. The size of several football fields, the two-story building is a modern marvel of electrical systems, fiber optics and air-conditioning to keep countless computer cabinets running day and night, O’Connell said. And it is all mostly unmanned.

Comedy. * * * PG-13. It's delightful and a little bewildering to find a 2012 comedy that evokes a world that exists only in the novels of P.G. Wodehouse. Whit Stillman's "Damsels in Distress" creates Seven Oaks College, a school so innocent and naive that only it could believe in itself. Its heroine, Violet Wister, is one of the daffiest characters in recent movies, who believes one of the noble callings of women is to date men who are their inferiors and thus lift them up.

Read's post was widely read. Even more readers devoured Liddy West's "Complete Guide to 'Hipster Racism'" (on sister Gawker Media site Jezebel), a phenomenon she called "the domain of educated, middle-class white people (like me -- to be clear, I am one of those) who believe that not wanting to be racist makes it okay for them to be totally racist."

Gretzky's fingerprints are on this season's team. It was Gretzky and his group who eventually reached out to Maloney, and the general manager's impact has been significant.

Free-agent pickups Raffi Torres and Adrian Aucoin are noteworthy, as was Maloney's belief in goalie Mike Smith.

"I would like to thank the Ohio Turnpike Commission for raising the tolls. This has caused me to travel less and use alternate scenic routes to make my trips to Toledo more enjoyable.

Ohioans gave the White House to Republican George H.W. Bush in 1988; the state's October 1988 unemployment rate was 5.8 percent. In October 1992, the Ohio unemployment rate was 7.3 percent, and voters retired Bush I by electing Democrat Bill Clinton. (And for all Bubba's defects, Ohio's unemployment rate was 4.9 percent just before his 1996 re-election and 3.9 percent -- a figure that today seems incredibly low -- as Clinton's presidency ended.)

We'd agree that it's important for parents to be involved in school operations and that school boards, administrators and staff should listen and respond to their concerns.

Simply shifting to a charter program -- when so many charters do not outperform public schools -- may not be the answer.
Given the care that music director Carlos Kalmar puts into his programs, though, it's worth noting what we missed. Kalmar got the orchestra invited to Carnegie Hall last spring on the strength of a war-themed program, and their recording of it, "Music for a Time of War," made the Billboard classical chart and many year-end top-10 lists. Though not billed as such, the latest program was a companion piece, with Renaissance composer Adriano Banchieri's depiction of battle, "La Battaglia," as a prelude to three major works written in war's aftermath: the Shostakovich, George Frideric Handel's "Music for the Royal Fireworks" and Leos Janácek's "Sinfonietta."

Since World War II there has been a rough consensus that freer trade is beneficial all around, and trade barriers have declined in most of the world.

Hey, Matthew: The other West Coast-type quarterback who comes to mind is Matt Flynn, who is Aaron Rodgers' backup in Green Bay and will get plenty of looks in free agency. Young is more accomplished, but Flynn is highly regarded by some and is reminiscent of Matt Schaub as a backup in Atlanta before given his shot in Houston. Given the Browns' allergic reaction to free agency, I would say neither player is a serious option for them.
The preview footage largely focused on Sparks, who was seen playing a piano in a modest home, glasses dangling from her nose. In later scenes, she appeared glammed up in sparkling, curve-hugging gowns. It's the American Idol winner's first notable Hollywood role.

Odds are, unless you're Canadian, you've never heard of Nanaimo. With a population of almost 84,000, it's the second largest town on sprawling, diverse Vancouver Island, 70 miles north of Victoria, far easier than that city to navigate, more affordable, and best of all, closer to the less-traveled areas of the island we most wanted to see.

Saturday's 100-67 defeat was disastrous on every level. The Knicks made just 35.7 percent of their field goals and turned the ball over 24 times.

That debt is reinforcing a central weakness of the Dutch economy: the plight of the Dutch consumer. After a decade of almost no growth, spending by households fell about 2% over the last year.

Instead, elected officials have convinced themselves that targeted, small sales tax increases don't mean much to consumers. In Ramsey County, for example, one commissioner said the sales tax increase amounts to a trifling 50 cents on a $100 purchase.
Once sold by door-knocking salesmen -- they were let go in 1996 -- the books caught on and became essential in homes, schools and libraries.

The decade that gave us the personal computer, the space shuttle, trade tensions with Japan, the first woman Supreme Court justice, eight years of Ronald Reagan as president -- and the fall of both Communism and New Coke -- also was a time of financial and real-estate stresses bearing more than a few similarities to those of today.
ø"There wasn't grumblings in opposition," said Deno Curris, president of UNI from 1983-95. "I think there was some consternation, as to why we would go that route, as opposed to getting someone who had more experience and who had been a coach."
The churches were shuttered in a massive retrenchment of Cleveland's urban core in 2010, striking at the Slavic and other ethnic European congregations that were founded by waves of immigrants from the wars and humanitarian catastrophes over the last century.

8. The Wharf: This bar/restaurant is an edgy outpost on the water. In fact, it looks like it could have come out of a novel set in New Orleans or Memphis because the outside seating is contained in narrow spaces that make you feel as if you're on a dilapidated riverfront dive that could collapse any moment.

He continued: "In my opinion, people are apathetic. It's an embarrassment in this country that we would have citizens who would be apathetic about this precious right to vote.
Much of the dialogue is handed to the many locals (actors and nonprofessionals) used in the film, and the script's homespun language captures the way the simplest remark can turn into a stinging, or sardonic, indictment depending on the subject at hand. The casting choices are unerring, making it virtually impossible to tell the actors from the ordinary folks. It gives "Bernie" a kind of authenticity that works with the stripped-down look of the film. There is also an intimacy, with Linklater relying on lots of close-ups and giving cinematographer Dick Pope ("The Illusionist") time to explore those faces.
The Alvas are grateful for the help. Their home is, Marisela said, a dream come true. "I'm very happy," she said. "We never thought this was possible."
The wind was blowing hard from left field late Tuesday afternoon, as four score of former Gophers and family members chatted and took photos at Siebert Field. This would be the only game of this spring and last ever at the ball yard that first served as the Gophers' baseball home in 1971.

"Spending too much" is a value judgment, of course, not a specific number. On average, couples with two kids and a household income in the middle range ($43,200 to $72,600) spend $7,493 a year on each child, from birth to age 17, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (The per-child total rises to $11,234 if you count their share of the cost of maintaining your home, such as insurance, mortgage interest, and utilities.) While those aren't princess-party budgets, spending much more than the averages may be overdoing it - and can even lead to credit card debt and other money troubles. A recent study by Robert Manning, Ph.D., professor of consumer finance at RIT in Rochester, NY, found that parents use credit more freely when buying for their children than when shopping for themselves.
Although white vinho verde wines are readily available, this was the first rosé I'd seen here. This delightful wine made from the exotic-sounding grapes of red vinhão, red azal and borraçal is light, fresh and crisp with a touch of sparkle. The Casal Garcia is a lovely rose color with a touch of peach when held up to the light. Although it's fruity, it's also quite dry, refreshing and easy to drink - plus it has an alcohol level of only 10.5 percent. Served chilled, this wine makes a great aperitif and a good match for Easter ham.

So it is with Wal-Mart. The company scoped out a potential site and identified a parcel that already is zoned for the kind of store it wants to put in. It announced plans to build on property that has been vacant for decades, and in accordance with the site's intended use. It did not propose one of its superstores but rather a relatively modest grocery outlet. It required no special action from the city because its plans were in compliance with the property's existing zoning.

One doesn't advocate laxity in the screening of Nigerian passengers. The reality is that, in the post-9/11 climate, few passengers ever get by without being thoroughly searched.

You sure it's not the shoes? Money, it's gotta be the shoes!
Human experience weighs more than human tissue.
Legorreta began his career in the shadow of his two mentors, Mexican modernists Luis Barragan and Jose Villagran, but by mid-career had become far more prolific than either one, landing work as far afield as London, Australia and Qatar.

Yes, there's quite a bit of damning evidence that he repeatedly lied about his steroid use in testimony before a House committee. But if the Justice Department wishes to prosecute everybody who makes "false and misleading statements" to Congress, it might start by handcuffing lawmakers at the end of each debate. Certainly, Clemens was contemptuous and disdainful of the lawmakers, but polls indicate he is joined in that sentiment by 75 percent of his countrymen. If the jury comes to regard the case as a competition between the greatest pitcher of his generation and the most unpopular Congress in generations, the Rocket just may add another one in the win column.

Archaeologists think so, too. When sites were originally excavated in the 18th and 19th centuries, toilet study was considered improper, and some toilets were even destroyed. But now, thanks to Roman sanitation expert Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow, who is publishing a book next year on the subject, and Barry Hobson, author of "Latrinae et Foricae: Toilets in the Roman World," some of the mysteries of ancient toilets have been solved, and new mysteries have emerged.

Don's experiences seemed to have taught him that there is something solitary and unknowable about every human life, Hessler wrote, "He saw connections of a different sort; these people and incidents were more like the spokes of a wheel.

"I truly think one of the key pieces in the future of higher education... is online.

Now, none of this denies that the Stuxnet worm might have kept Iran's program from accelerating even more quickly. It appears, for example, that Stuxnet may have caused about 1,000 Iranian centrifuges to fail. According to IAEA data, in May 2009, right before the first known Stuxnet infection, Iran was operating 4,920 centrifuges at Natanz. By January 2010, only 3,772 centrifuges were spinning there. It is also plausible that sanctions have impeded Iran's ability to purchase materials for new centrifuges.

Adults who imbibe can appreciate the warming properties of wine, particularly when served within walking distance of where they're spending the night. The Scheid Vineyards Wine Lounge across from the Clement is an inviting place to settle in, particularly if a fire's burning in the large hearth at the rear, with local charcuterie and cheeses also available. On Nov. 17, McIntyre Vineyards will throw a party to celebrate both the grand opening of its Tasting Studio in the Hyatt Regency Monterey and the release of its latest sparkling wine (one of the few bubblies grown in the region). Nondrinkers should note the new tasting room also features nibbles from regional purveyors such Nunes Farms (nuts and confections), Lula's Chocolates and Olio Nuevo (olive oil), plus gifts from local artists.

PASOK, which stormed to victory in the last parliamentary election in 2009 with 43.92 percent and George Papandreou at its helm, has seen its support collapse over the past two years. Now headed by former finance minister Evangelos Venizelos, it is fighting off a challenge by anti-bailout left-wing parties, with opinion polls projecting PASOK to win between 14.5 and 19 percent. If that happens, it would be the lowest since November 1974, when the party won 13.5 percent just two months after being founded.

Same with most other coaches in the state — Florida State's Jimbo Fisher, Florida's Will Muschamp and Miami's Al Golden to name a few. Although isn't it ironic that Fisher and Muschamp ban many of their assistant coaches — some of them fathers and grandfathers — from talking to the real media but they allow 19-year-old college students to get liquored up and go on social media at 2 in the morning? It doesn't really jibe with their philosophy of controlling the message emanating from their programs.
Love has been the one constant, and coach Rick Adelman has struggled to take him off the floor while the team tried to stay in the playoff hunt.

Gordon-McKenna-Vernetti are at 0.2 now and Makovsky-Mitchell are at 0.1, so mathematically they have had an infinite ratings increase - a percentage of change can't be calculated with a starting point of zero.

There’s nothing wrong with not wanting kids, and your fear of having your life upended makes emotional sense. However, your argument doesn’t make sense-sense. Either you can project enough joy in family life to accept that kids’ needs are anything but convenient — and, therefore, can say, “I do want children” without setting off any pandering- or wishful-thinking-meters — or you can’t.

It wasn't "mob justice" for Martin's family or the activists who came to their aid to insist on further examination of an incident in which an unarmed 17-year-old was killed by a private citizen who reported sighting a "suspicious guy" and apparently disregarded a dispatcher's advice not to follow him.
My love affair with Roquefort possibly began in the womb. My mother loved all things French, especially pungent cheeses.

I'd offer him some tea, but I'm sure he's headed to bed.
