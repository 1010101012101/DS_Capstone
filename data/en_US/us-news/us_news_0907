And the friends who were warning me about my newfound hermit tendencies ... they were just trying to tear us apart.

Moving on to the french fries. It would be tough to give up the crispy outside/cloud-like inside spuds here. Butcher & Burger uses Kennebec potatoes (just like West Coast chain In-N-Out Burger), which have a low starch content and thus fluff up nice and light. Those who swear by Hot Doug's duck fat fries may not approve.

This R&B up-and-comer recently topped the charts with "Whatcha Say," an Auto-Tune apologia built around an Imogen Heap sample. Unfortunately, the rest of Jason Derulo's self-titled debut also leans heavily on hand-me-down hooks.

Escott: Elvis and Perkins and Cash had all bumped around Mississippi together, working for next to no money. In the year (before this recording session) Elvis had become literally the biggest star in the world. In 1956, one of every two records pressed in America was Elvis. But Perkins and Cash had been on equal footing with Elvis in the years before; he had streaked ahead. Each was trying to deal with that in his own way. (Jerry Lee) Lewis had just signed on at Sun literally weeks beforehand. He desperately believed that he belonged in the company of Presley and Cash.

Of course, we still have George Washington. He was born on the third Monday in February. Every school child knows that. Actually, there is something of a dispute about his birth date.

But what? Paying players because they have needs that aren't covered in the cost of a free education?

Coincidentally, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission last week issued an "Enforcement Guidance" limiting the rights of employers to take into account the criminal convictions and arrest records of job applicants because of the "disparate impact" the consideration of such matters might have on minorities.

Consider a spin through the committee's thinking process. Who would win, Iona or Seton Hall on neutral court? Iona or Oral Roberts? Iona or Drexel? (Disagree with who would win? Now you get the pitfalls) Those are half of the first six teams out, the others: Miami, Nevada and Mississippi State. It’s hard to quibble with the Iona pick when you take other measurements into account. Kenpom.com has the Gaels ahead of Mississippi St, Nevada, and Oral Roberts.

As a doctor viewing the Supreme Court drama unfolding over the Affordable Care Act, I have high hopes that patients will emerge with much more access to the wonders that modern medicine can provide.

The Big Ten hasn't even officially announced that it definitely will create a football championship game, so the conference certainly hasn't taken formal bids from any potential sites for the game. (Commissioner Jim Delany should update the process at the Big Ten meetings on Aug. 2-3.) But with Nebraska accepted as a new conference member and the league expanding to 12 teams for the 2011 season, it's easy to see why a title game is a near lock and why at least five stadiums have expressed an interest in hosting the game.

5. Going down hills at high speed: You'd think this would be another no-brainer. High-speed descending is part of pro cycling. Often, they top 55 mph on winding mountain roads. The pros also ride on a closed course. Many amateur cyclists are injured or killed while descending at high speed. Even in the first week of the Tour de France, there was a high-speed pile-up on a twisting downhill section that led to several serious injuries.

A: Like I said in the blog, build a moat around the court. If the fans in the front row stick their legs out too far, then the alligators will take care of them. All of that said, LeBron has to stop backing into the crowd as he did Sunday in New York and back at Staples Center against the Lakers.

And sometimes that mission changes, as was the case with the 1-126th, which saw its deployment strength reduced by 40% to 330 troops because of shifting Pentagon needs -- a relief, certainly, for some soldiers and their families, but a complication for others who had made arrangements for a prolonged absence from work or school. Such is the life of a National Guard member. Such is the commitment.

Given that Maryland will open the season against defending national champion Kentucky at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. – the Wildcats will likely be preseason No. 1 in many polls despite the likelihood of losing nearly their entire starting lineup – the opportunity will be there for the Terps to create some early noise.
For Venezia, the choice means going without his blood-pressure medicine. For Bradburn, it means not purchasing the testing strips to help monitor her diabetes.
"If you do decide to move to another table and again lose a minimum buy-in, that's a good time to call it a day. As you win at a table, keep your stop loss the same as the minimum buy-in. Don't increase it as you win. If you are sitting in a $2-$5 no-limit game, having bought in for $200, and at some point find yourself with $500 in front of you, now you should be committed to leaving the game if your stack dips down to $300. You can stay in the game as long as you're winning, but once you take a minimum buy-in backslide, it's a good indicator that it's time to get up."
Ever since Vanity Fair put her on its January 2010 cover in what looked like a Wonder Woman costume, Tina Fey has seemed in danger of falling for the very canard she has spent a career satirizing: that a woman can "have it all" if she's willing to lose 20 pounds, show her breasts and regularly remind everyone that, although she writes and stars in an Emmy-winning TV show, she is still essentially a loser who eats a lot of cupcakes. (Just like, you know, Larry David does.) An excerpt from her new book in a recent New Yorker didn't help, with Fey assuming the position of agonized career mommy — why do so many people keep asking her if she is going to have another baby when having one is so hard? Fey wonders hysterically, never once considering that these people are Just Making Polite Conversation.
"I think the NBA is, in my opinion, if you look at all the major sports, it's probably the most progressive," he said. "So it doesn't surprise me at all that the NBA goes through the steps to make sure that African-Americans get recognized at whatever time they need to be. You look across the board in the NBA and there's a nice mix of diversity within the NBA right now. Obviously, at 35 as an African-American, I had an opportunity to be a head coach. You look around the league and see that in a lot of different positions, not just coaching positions. So it's good to be a part of the NBA, especially with what's going in Washington right now."

Ken Fisher of money manager Fisher Investments says "Sell in May" is "garbage" precisely for this reason. He gives the example of September, which has dropped an average 0.72 percent since 1926. But the month has had many big up and down moves over 85 years. He says if you remove just two of the worst Septembers, stocks break even for the month.

But that restraint, coupled with the building's deep interest in energy-efficiency and in using landscape design to reach out to the surrounding neighborhood, make it in many ways as chastened a piece of architecture as Abraham's building in New York. Rather subtly -- too subtly for Rogers and Palumbo, clearly -- it makes the argument that the best way for the U.S. to change its image abroad is by toning down its rhetoric and acknowledging that its days standing astride over the world, and madly draining its energy reserves, are over.

Love transcends. Everyone has an idea what the word means. Everyone has some sort of experience … akin to the word — positive or negative, yesterday or years ago, something they want in the future. For most people, it's a very positive thing. People want to think about love. They want to have it. This project has possibilities because of that. Most people want it in their life. It's a very powerful thing. Kind of a hopeful thing too.

Under the direction of the playwright herself -- never a good sign -- the performers deserve combat pay, particularly poor Reiner in the thankless role of Harpie. Fraser, looking terrific, does what she can, and Shackner is quite good as the troubled teen.
"They didn't settle and we settled, so it played a part. Again, I'm playing with 5-8 and 6-2 and they are playing with 6-foot-8 and so you young, big, strong guys have to get better. That is something we will work on."

Doctors pumped him with steroids to prevent his body from rejecting the bone marrow transplant. That caused him to gain 70 pounds and destroyed his joints, putting him in a wheelchair for three years. He spent most of his high school days at home or in the hospital.

As a rule, districts participating in schools of choice are to be commended and encouraged for expanding educational options. But some districts are being too clever if they think they can keep out what they perceive as undesirable students by imposing academic hurdles. Gaming the system cheats students, invites a lawsuit, violates the law and could result in a cut to a district's state aid.

The MdTA is also shortsighted to think that this proposed system cannot be cheated. For multiple car families (almost a given in rural Maryland), one E-ZPass could serve as a means of transporting all cars across the river. Just swap out the E-ZPass from one car to another. Thus, the bridge revenue could fall far short of what the lawmakers in Annapolis are projecting. Furthermore, people already in Cecil County who decide not to get an E-ZPass will flee to Delaware for the nearest bowling alley, home improvement warehouse, department store or restaurant, leading to lower state sales tax receipts — and eventually, fewer jobs. The E-ZPass system would be a real loser for Maryland.
Florida has hit the skids entering the SEC Tournament, losing three games in a row, all by double digits. Notre Dame lost back-to-back games before beating Providence. Iowa State, on the other hand, finished a brutal three-game stretch (at Kansas State, at Missouri, vs. Baylor) with a 2-1 mark, which should be enough to get the Cyclones out of the dreaded 8/9 matchup.

“So we can’t take this Hawks team for granted. Every game that we played with them this year has been awfully close. We’ve just got to be able to protect our homecourt. It’ll be great getting (the suspended Rajon) Rondo back. Hopefully we can feed off our home crowd.”
Why it could change: The Tigers will rely on one of two quarterbacks: Junior Zach Mettenberger (8-of-11, 92 yards, 1 TD in 2011) is first in line, and redshirt freshman Stephen Rivers (brother of San Diego Chargers QB Philip Rivers) is No. 2. Either way, it’s another potentially dicey situation at the most important position on the field—unless Mettenberger plays to the level of his high school hype.
The Heirloom Bench was inspired by 19th-century chests that would have been used in a barn to hold grain. Moser's cedar-lined version has a hinged top and could be topped with a cushion for a window seat with interior storage. It's 21 inches high and 53 inches wide and sells for $4,750.

The spire designed by the late architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957 came to life as north Scottsdale's tallest structure in 2004. The 125-foot spire rose southeast of Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard, becoming the city's western "gateway." The sky-blue acrylic windows and lattice-work structure light up at night. Conceived by Wright two years before his death, the spire was part of his design for an Arizona Capitol complex. The plans were tucked away in the archives at Taliesin West in Scottsdale for more than four decades before developer Jim Pederson revived the spire as a gateway monument for his Scottsdale Promenade shopping and office complex.

This morning I want to highlight misconduct that involved the handling of evidence and misconduct that involved officers’ interactions with individuals. 1. Strike Force employees repeatedly took seized property home for their own personal use. These items included large screen and flat screen televisions; electronics equipment, recreational items, computer equipment and other property. 2. On some occasions, Strike Force employees purchased property that had been seized for their own use. These included televisions, jet skis, trailers and tools. 3. Because of the dismal record keeping at the Strike Force and poor evidence handling procedures, there are many items that, according to the records, should be in the evidence room but are simply missing. These include tools, electronic equipment, televisions and jewelry.

Several officials said the last time the Legislature seriously tackled education reform was in 1991 when it adopted an ambitious plan for improving student performance. The plan, championed by then-Rep. Vera Katz, who later became Portland mayor, led many school districts to require students to obtain a Certificate of Initial Mastery, but the effort later fizzled.

The final blow, an 8-1 defeat, occurred this afternoon before a sparse crowd at Minute Maid Park. The team’s starter, Chris Schwinden, gave up five runs in four innings.

Question: The movie is getting great reviews. What's it like to be part of that?
Favorite train ride: Caledonian from Inverness to London. High-speed rail has made the overnight train an anachronism through much of Europe. The Caledonian survives (some say because it is beloved by Scottish members of Parliament who like the comfort of its sleeper berths compared to the security gantlet of airports or the daylong trip during daylight hours). I rode from Inverness to London and with the late sunset in summer, was able to enjoy scenery nearly all the way to the border with England. I arrived in London's Euston Station rested and relaxed, and already in the center of the city.

When you ask an airline why it goes through this charade, you get a long sermon about fuel costs, but that doesn't really answer the question. The question is why they don't just raise fares to cover increased fuel costs, the way U.S. lines (and most other businesses) do -- why instead they split the real fare into two components, and they never answer that. I have a few theories:

That kind of speculation is what makes the draft so compelling to so many people. It combines pro football and gossip. What's more popular than that? Sure, the rumor-mongering and microanalysis are maddening at times, but the draft has become another ingenious creation by the NFL to keep its product on the front burner year-round.
"I was staying positive, I was having positive thoughts," said Wedge.
The proposal also would require wealthy districts to offer preschool to poor children attending their schools, with the state picking up the tab.

Some of the narrative moments – such as James’ parents being pursued by the rhinoceros - are handled through comical shadow-puppet projections designed by Dorian Kofinas. They lend a hey-let’s-put-on-a-show quality to the production, which shows us that you don’t really need CGI effects to fire the imagination. You just need some committed actors and talented craftspeople.

For the first time in his career, Rupp ran between 110 and 120 miles a week during training last year and he would like to build on that. Most of his competitors have been running a similarly high volume for years. He also hopes to work on "shorter interval" runs where he's featuring a "50-second pace" for specific periods.

"They don't have an endless amount of money, and they have to pick and choose. I would be extremely surprised if they stayed in the race as it's configured now," said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor of the Cook Political Report. The association did not return e-mails for comment.
If The Sun doesn't believe coverage of primary races selecting candidates for a U.S. presidential election is news, what do the editors think is important ("Romney rolling toward the fall," April 25)?

If you have run across an unorthodox "Like Water for Chocolate"-style mole in Los Angeles in the last few years, chances are pretty good that Camacho had something to do with it. She's into that mystical thing here. Half of the menu items have been renamed for goddesses so that the nopales salad becomes diosa quetzal and the shrimp ceviche in a super-spicy marinade of lime and puréed herbs becomes diosa afrodita. The guacamoles, which may include diced serrano chiles or habanero and passion fruit, are called diosa amorosa and diosa sangre ardiente — love goddess and goddess of hot blood.

One of her classic designs, called the Siren, was created three years ago after Ms. Mills saw a photograph of supermodel Kate Moss wearing a black dress with one side cut out. She quickly sketched out the idea that the dress inspired—not so much its look, but the sultry feel it inspired in her. As it turned out, the samples based on the sketch worked well without requiring dramatic changes, and the resulting suit mirrors her original sketch. It's a slinky bathing suit with adjustable straps and two long ties that can wrap around the body or hang loose.

People are paying more attention, Seiter said. But there are things people can do to make a difference besides changing travel plans. Just slowing down and following the speed limit, taking good care of their cars, buying more fuel-efficient cars, keeping the proper air pressure in tires  all these things are small, but they add up to making a difference. Just combining multiple errands and avoiding unnecessary short trips can enable someone to save money that way and keep their plans for a longer trip.

What kind of eating town is San Sebastián? It's a city where the concentration of tapas bars—called pintxos bars—makes Madrid look like Columbus, Ohio. It's where businessmen cook for each other in private dining clubs instead of playing golf. It's where you can consult that list of the 50 best restaurants in the world as casually as a traveler to Arizona might look at the crumpled page on Scottsdale steakhouses ripped out of an airline magazine—four of the 50 are in the metropolitan area, which isn't bad for a city of 400,000.

We walked to my car. After some closing hugs I backed out the drive as I had done hundreds of times before. I paused by the sign. I looked carefully at the trash bag and the rose on a hand lettered sign. Why not a nice cloth to drape the sign? Why only one simple rose? After a moment of reflection I realized that really, as unusual as the choice for mourning was, it was exactly right. He was just a little, old, brilliant craftsman who was neither worried about his clothing, nor his building, nor his truck, nor what people thought of him. He was unpretentious and genuine.

One was visible. Red told us he was loved. So, when you think about it, a black trash bag and one red rose were in fact, perfect together.

forest away from the beach and boat ramp because of the traffic. You won't see much, or any, wildlife near the roads. The state Department of Natural Resources appears to have cleared a lot of underbrush and tall grass near the roads, so there's no cover for small animals. The upside is there's almost no road kill. A lot of predatory birds circle the lakeshore, mostly vultures and an occasional hawk. So smaller birds stay close to the ground and are easier to identify and photograph. Tree lovers have a variety of Missouri hardwoods to examine.

"There are no innocent bystanders. We have to create a culture where bystanders help break the bullying cycle," she said. "If a bully didn't have an audience, they probably wouldn't be bullying."
But at least part of the explanation is guns themselves -- or, more specifically, the recent and uniquely American addiction to high-powered personal weaponry. Although ropes and bombs are also mentioned, most of the people threatening Piven on Beck's website referred lovingly to their guns, often by caliber and number of available rounds. As Joan Burbick, author of the 2006 book, "Gun Show Nation: Gun Culture and American Democracy," has observed, "The act of buying a gun can mimic political action. It makes people feel as if they are engaging in politics of political protest." She quotes one gun enthusiast: "Whenever I get mad at the government, I go out and buy a gun."

I'm not 100% sure I'd find any fault whatsoever with the Adonit's keyboard if I didn't have the Zagg to compare it with. But the Zagg's keys feel thicker and snappier, and the base is slightly more stable. With both keyboards in the office, I consistently gravitate towards the Zagg.

There are valid societal and other reasons for prohibiting these kinds of "marriages," but once marriage loses its special status, the burden is on the state to articulate why other forms of marriage ought to be invalid.

EVS26, which runs Sunday through May 9 but is open to the public only on Sunday, is not a car show. New cars will be unveiled, but the is about a lot more than cars. It is about the electrification of an entire transportation culture. The symposium is meant to be a place where technologists, the auto industry, policy wonks, start-up companies and unforeseen players come together to talk about electrifying the car and its components and also public transport, industrial vehicles and processes, the roadways, government policy and our energy future. To that end, Wynne’s organization changed its name from the Electric Vehicle Assn. of America to focus instead on electric drive – which can be configured a whole bunch of ways we haven’t imagined yet. The EDTA represents such members as carmakers, smart-grid technologists, fleets such as UPS and lithium miners.

Atlanta does have that reputation, but like many large cities in the U.S. today, it was one of the hardest hit because of banking and housing (downturns), so that growth has significantly slowed down. I believe growth is driven by some natural occurrences. You have to have water - be it industrial or residential growth. And people tend to follow jobs, which means housing. The other part of the formula is you have to have energy. When I look at the St. Louis region, you have a strong electric provider. You have Peabody here, and of course Laclede. So energy is important in that formula. Another thing they're looking at is schools, not just K-12, but also advanced learning, and the St. Louis area and Missouri has a strong advanced education system. The other piece is healthcare. And again I give the St. Louis area and Missouri high marks.

ø29. Detroit Lions: GM Martin Mayhew has done a phenomenal job rebuilding this rising team's talent. But it's possible none of his 2012 selections will start this year, though we applaud the decision to finally get a promising tackle with the first-round choice of Riley Reiff, who could push RT Gosder Cherilus or earn playing time at guard. Second-round WR Ryan Broyles is battling back from an ACL tear but looks like a slot guy, much like 2011 second-rounder Titus Young. And will third-round CB Dwight Bentley be able to quickly make contributions to a secondary that needs them? We like the long-term outlook for Oklahoma LBs Ronnell and Travis Lewis.

A lot of headlines after the State of the Union said Obama made a pitch for economic fairness. He did, but he's barking up Republicans, if not Democrats, the wrong way. Life isn't always fair. And an equality of outcome shouldn't be the goal. An equality of opportunity should be, and is, in America. If Obama and other Democrats would change their tone and stop making the rich feel bad for what they have, they'd have a better chance of getting the rich behind the idea of helping even more.

With a constant stream of live threat reporting to start each day, I was done with playing defense.
1. The Lakers unraveled in the second half. After exhibiting great ball movement, energy and disciplined defense en route to a 30-18 first quarter, it was only natural for the Lakers to unravel. They've done it plenty of times this season. So it wasn't surprising it happened again. The Thunder inflicted most of their damage in the third quarter. Pau Gasol picked up his fourth foul. Kobe Bryant, who scored 23 points points on seven-of-25 shooting, missed all four field-goal attempts. Andrew Bynum had no one to pass to out of double and triple teams. Troy Murphy was ineffective in shooting and defending Kendrick Perkins (10 points in the third quarter, really?). The Lakers rarely ran through their offense through Ramon Sessions and mostly through isolation. And absolutely no one could stop Russell Westbrook from dropping 17 of his 34 points in the third quarter.

People who don’t like pop music often believe everything mainstream artists do is driven by the bottom line — that pop is product, and product is always about delivering a satisfactory experience to the customer. But pop is not a fast-food restaurant. Listeners are, up to a certain point, willing to cope with reprocessed content, but if all you’re serving is a gussied-up plate of somebody else’s leftovers, the doors are going to close on your establishment in a hurry. A successful record is always an amalgam of the familiar and the novel, and artists who respect themselves — and their audiences — acknowledge that.

15. Mark Wilson, United States -- A 1997 graduate of the University of North Carolina, Wilson lives near Chicago now, but he heads back to the Tar Heel State almost every chance he gets on the PGA Tour. This week, he returns to the circuit after taking two weeks off and will play for the sixth consecutive year and the seventh time overall in the Wells Fargo Championship. ... Even though he enjoys coming back to Quail Hollow, Wilson has not fared all that well in the tournament. He has missed the cut in three of his seven appearances, including last year, when he shot 74-76--150 to miss the weekend by six strokes. However, he did play well two years ago, when he closed with a 5-under-par 67 to finish in a tie for seventh, nine strokes behind winner Rory McIlroy. That is the only time that Wilson has broken 70 in 18 rounds at Quail Hollow, where he is a total of 24-over. ... Wilson is playing for the 13th time on the PGA Tour this season, more than any of the top players, and he needs to find the form he had earlier this season, when he captured the Humana Challenge and finished third in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. When he tied for 24th in his last outing, at the RBC Heritage, it was the first time he had finished in the top 25 in his last six events, including a missed cut in the Masters. Wilson has won five times in his PGA Tour career but never after March, a dubious distinction that he would love to change.
