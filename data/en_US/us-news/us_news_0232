The state’s law on harassment has been criticized as vague, although it has been upheld on appeal. Yet Klingeman noted that based on what has been released so far, it is unclear that any actual harassment was specifically directed at the victim. And, he said, it seemed incidental to the students who have been charged that Clementi was aware of what was going on — if Clementi was not aware of what was going on, it would be difficult to charge harassment.

snagged the opportunity to read it for review before publication, and I am loving it. American history, religious history and family history are all bound up together in ways that would be true in many of our personal stories, except that we rarely recognize the intersections and influences. I look forward to writing about the book after I finish it. There is one passage in the book that's on my mind today, though. In a chapter entitled "The Civil War as a Theological Struggle", Himes discusses the ease with which supporters of slavery were able to make the "biblical" case for their position. As Himes writes, "The abolitionist argument that slavery was contrary to the Bible was much less straightforward."

It has zoomed into the top 5 in recent ratings periods among all stations regardless of format in the male 25-54 age demographic - the audience sports-talk radio targets - a lofty status never has been held by another St. Louis sports-talk outlet. WXOS made its debut in January 2009, 10 months after Barrett's departure from KFNS, and now is among the top-rated sports-talk stations in the country. But the lure of the nation's No. 4 market and the chance to launch another FM station switching from music to sports are drawing Barrett away.

"I think (the Fire Department) has kind of a separate life because it is public safety," Berardino told me Monday. "I think this council's irresponsible approach (in general) means you can't draw any conclusions from this. I think they are so irrational in the way they approach anything involving employees, that I don't think you can make any cogent analysis of what they are doing. It's like a schizophrenic on the streets talking to himself, you know? Who knows what it means?"

For example, consider Jonah's reluctance to go to Nineveh. He has no desire to go there. Nineveh was the seat of the Assyrian empire, a nation with a well-deserved reputation for being cruel and mean. It was the enemy of Israel, far beyond the reach of God. Not only was Nineveh a place he did not want to go, it was a place where Jonah believed God should not be, either. Ninevites were beyond redemption. They were the "other," they were enemies.

After dinner at Boa, we got a true taste of old-school LA glamour at the nearby Chateau Marmont, the storied hotel that was built in1927. We sat on the patio “proper” and drank strong negronis and stayed past last call. The night was gorgeous, the crowd was sexy, funky and chill, and it was all so unlike New York’s often exhausting nightlife scene. We didn’t want to leave. If there had been food to share, we would have given it to every single lovely person on the patio.
If you're renting a car, your driver's license is all you need in most places, but some countries, including Austria, Greece, Italy and Spain, also require an International Driving Permit.

James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said there might be an opening for Newark in the condo sector. "Maybe the cheap stuff in Jersey City is long gone," he said. "You could have a cost advantage over Hoboken, Jersey City if developers can get the land cheap."

Islamabad ordered the closure of U.S. and NATO supply lines.

The most interesting cure I heard came from Robert Nagel, 60, of Wabash, Ind., whose 30-year battle with constant migraine pain ended five years ago after he was treated for shingles, a painful condition caused by the re-emergence of the chickenpox virus. The medication Nagel was prescribed, Famvir, got rid of the shingles and his migraines. He since has been pain-free, with once-yearly doses of the drug.
Questionable Calls: The Panthers' two greatest holes heading into the draft were at defensive tackle and cornerback, but they didn't do anything to address the first area and Norman is a quintessential boom-or-bust pick.

"Every year, we have to reduce what we can cover for our employees and increase what they have to pay," said Balenseifen, president of the Rex Oil distribution company in north Denver. "It's having exactly the opposite effect of what they said they were trying to do."
In fact, for all its breadth and scope, at heart the book has a narrow focus. It is really a diptych with Richard Neutra on one side and Rudolph Schindler on the other. Though both were born in Vienna, these two giants of Southern California modernism could hardly, temperamentally speaking, have been more different. Schindler, five years older and a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright, was romantic, unpredictable, gruff and a determined loner. He picked fights and nursed grudges. His work was propelled by an expressionistic risk-taking Neutra's lacked. Neutra was more prolific and, though a gigantic and innovative talent, also a better promoter of his own career and legend than Schindler.
Start by hiking west up the dirt road, and don't worry about the lack of signs to the National Trail just yet. About a mile into the hike you'll find a couple of old stone buildings, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the latter years of the Great Depression. The National Trail officially begins just a little west of those buildings, and climbs quickly up the slope.
By now the sun was high in the sky, and a wide spray of beams pushed through the redwoods. After ascending on a dank stretch of asphalt straight out of the "Legend of Bigfoot," we finally spied a pair of upright wine barrels flanking a gravel driveway. No sign marked the turn, just a street number: 550. As Rod steered onto the pavement, I spotted bottles and glasses on a table inside an off-the-rack warehouse not unlike Alfaro's. Beyond it, the slope steepened on its ascent to 1,000 feet above Monterey Bay.
Spurs keep rolling along, winners of three straight after knocking off OKC.
Efforts by Port Authority police to find the man who caused the breach are ongoing, the bistate agency which runs the airport said in a statement tonight. Police asked that anyone with information about the case call 1-800-828-PAPD (7273). Menendez said that coupled with the attempted underwear bombing on Christmas Day aboard a flight headed for Detroit, the Newark incident "has shaken the confidence of the American people."

Then, in his first month in office, FitzGerald examined the request. He objected to Administrative Judge Thomas O'Malley's request for a desktop and two laptops, he said last month.
With one decision (to bring the baby home), Will seems to believe that he is now entitled to dismiss the reality of other people's lives -- that when confronted with cataclysmic situations, other people decide what to do without anguish, without guilt, without spiritual, religious or moral internal guidance.
I have not been on a bicycle since 1987. Well, not the kind that actually goes anywhere. I have a recumbent (fancy word for reclining) exercise bike that is a great exercise machine about twice a year, and otherwise makes an excellent clothes hanger.
There he is in 1987, a successful composer and sound engineer, commenting on the death of avant garde filmmaker Curt McDowell, a close friend.

4. WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION. All entries will be judged on or about March 16, 2011 (the "Judging Date") by a panel of judges comprised of photo authorities Holly Andres, Lincoln Barbour, and Laura Valenti. The judges will score entries based on the following criteria: 25% originality, 25% creativity, 25% composition and 25% photography skill. The entry with the highest overall score will be declared the potential Grand Prize winner. In the event of a tie, the entry with the highest score in the creativity criteria will prevail. In addition, First, Second, and Third prize winners, as well as two honorable mentions, will be chosen in each of the three categories. Judges reserve the right to disqualify any image. Decisions of Judges are final and binding in all respects. Any potential winner will be notified by mail, email and/or telephone. If a potential winner cannot be contacted, does not respond within five (5) days from the date the Sponsor first tries to notify him/her, and/or the prize or prize notification is returned as undeliverable, such potential winner forfeits all rights to win the Promotion or receive the prize, and an alternate potential winner may be selected. Upon contacting a potential winner and determining that he/she has met all eligibility requirements of the Promotion, including without limitation the execution of required waivers, publicity and liability releases and disclaimers, such individual will be declared the "winner" of the Promotion.

The Portland port market is not one of our biggest markets nationally, but it has always really supported our wines, particularly the reserve rubies. You have a lot of very discerning consumers, particularly at the restaurant level, who are looking for new and exciting things. And people are accepting of port as something that is not easily imitated. The last time I was calling on customers here, there were an extraordinary number of organic-aware grocery chains. That fits very well with what we are doing. We are quite old-fashioned.

Former Falcons tight end Alge Crumpler turned in the team’s card and announced the pick in New York.
For the second time in as many years, the House Republican leadership has put forward a deficit-cutting budget plan that's more of a political statement than a governing blueprint. The proposed budget for fiscal 2013 promotes a long list of conservative policies that are only tangentially related to the federal fisc — for example, repealing new federal restrictions on Wall Street and ending the moratorium on offshore oil drilling. Even the proposals that are purely fiscal in nature rely on changes in law that Senate Democrats won't support, such as repealing the 2010 healthcare reform law.

Pat Shurmur, on Weeden's fitting into the West Coast offense: "When you get your players, you plug them in. You try to do more of the things they do well and less of the things they don't. I think we evaluated him with the idea that he can do what we do. We will see as we start to work with him, the things that he does well in conjunction with the players he is working with."
"Considering the economic climate we're in, it was a little surprising to hear such a request," Simon said of the prosecutor's proposal. "When you look at parity, you have to have parity on both sides of the equation. You make the cuts if you want to raise some of the salaries. That's what the executive has done."

Genesis — Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford — morphed from British prog-rock mainstay in the 1960s and '70s to pop-rock hit machine in the '80s and '90s. The group’s epic songs and thematic albums helped define an oft-maligned yet historically valid genre, before the band streamlined its sound and Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins became solo superstars.

Redfern won the chairman's job in late 2005 on the coattails of Strickland, who by that point had emerged as the Democratic frontrunner for 2006. Strickland, who lost his re-election bid to Kasich in 2010, said last year that he was considering another run. But other contenders could include Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald and Richard Cordray, Ohio's former attorney general and Obama's pick to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

But despite this political popularity, Americans are using their local post office less than ever before. Electronic alternatives such as stamps.com, as well as sales at supermarkets and other retails stores, have meant fewer trips to the post office. As a result, traffic at America's post offices dropped 21 percent from 2009 to 2010. Fully 80 percent of post offices lose money.

The sound mix in the Beaumont was unusually clear Tuesday evening. But there was another sound problem: the heavy din of people trying to talk over the music. Even during Run, which was played early, about half of the people in the very back of the room were ignoring the band. That behavior improved gradually as the show proceeded and the set list turned to older or more familiar material.

Once upon a time, the implicit patriotism of the day somehow swept Zin into Thanksgiving's embrace. That might have worked - stressing the word "might" - when Zins tended to be in what is now eye-rollingly called the "claret style," with more freshness and red fruit, and less oak and alcohol. Unless you're basting the turkey with barbecue sauce or hoisin, most Zins will steamroll your meal. That also goes for many heavier Shirazes/Syrahs, though some lighter, aromatic versions might work.
Diced or coarsely chopped garlic works well in sautés, soups and stews, while minced garlic is best for vinaigrettes and other light sauces.
Boe needed the money to cover his debts — which reached an astounding $22 million by 1978 — but losing Erving sent the Nets on a free fall that lasted five years. They had gone from two-time champions to utterly irrelevant, and though they would get a temporary boost from the opening of Brendan Byrne Arena in 1981, the building had the ambiance of a drafty barn by the time it reached middle age.
“Scott Norwood, nobody realizes, it was 47 yards on grass and he had never kicked one on grass that far in his career,” Tynes said. “That’s a long kick. When you play this position, we’re the only guys who know what it feels like.”
The bottom line here is to realize that abysmal aberrations in winning and losing do happen, but losing aberrations do not last forever. Luck may well be seen as something beyond your control, but you can change it some by limiting your bets to wagers that have less than a 2% casino advantage.
Turns out the coffeecake post was Prudent Baby's top post of 2011 (thanks to links to it by, among others, an online group for pot smokers who were psyched about a five-minute cure for the munchies). Co-founder Jaime Morrison Curtis, who came up with the cinnamon-flavored cake as an alternative to chocolate cake-in-a-cup recipes, recognized its appeal right away.

Waller, who did not return calls, has said he feels comfortable that prosecutors made their decisions based on the evidence they had at the time. Critics argue that prosecutors relied in some cases on confessions coerced by overzealous detectives, and that they continued to pursue suspects even after DNA testing raised doubts about their guilt.
"Nobody ever wanted anything to do with it throughout all those years, until they found out the thing got sold," said Lensing, 64. "So now, after 25, 30 years … they all come out of the woodwork."
The Cardinals' 15 total steals through 19 games this season rank just about in the middle of the National League, but they are -- as expected -- well ahead of last year's pace that put them in the cement-footed dregs of the league when it came to steals. The Cardinals swiped their 15th base of the season in their 23rd game last season, but that was promptly followed by a stretch with two SBs in their next 13 games. (This is the spot in the blog where I point out the steal-related poll.)
A police report obtained by The Kansas City Star shows the shotgun used to kill Jordan may have made its way into the hands of the mob several years before the murder. The report said the gun was part of a cache of stolen weapons sold through a North End Italian fence in 1966.

The freshman senator calls his evolving legislation a conservative alternative to the Dream Act, the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors measure. That Democratic-backed bill, which is overwhelmingly popular with Hispanics, would provide a pathway to citizenship to children in the United States illegally if they attend college or join the military. The measure came close to passage in December 2010 but has languished since then.
But I want to be clear it's not about megalomania. We're not trying to rule the world. I just want to grant license to the range of talent here to pursue those things.

Bluesman Freddie King, who died in 1976 at the age of 42, will be inducted as an Early Influence. The Award for Musical Excellence, which typically goes to sidemen and studio professionals, was bestowed upon producer and engineer Glyn Johns, who worked on many of the cornerstone albums of the classic rock period, including "Beggar's Banquet," "Who's Next," and the first three Eagles sets. Atlantic house producer Tom Dowd, who recorded everybody from Otis Redding to Dusty Springfield, and Cosimo Matassa, the premiere New Orleans recording engineer and studio owner of the early rock period. There were rumors that the E Street Band would be inducted as sidemen; these did not materialize.

Ann Mullin of the Gund Foundation, one of those instrumental in the cooperative's formation, said CWRU's work moved the foundations to act because it "illustrated the enormity of the problem."
Lou Compton, president of the Maryland Bowhunters Society, agrees that the DNR should raise its hunting license fee for the first time since 1989, but the amount being asked and the manner in which it has been done angers Compton and some of his members.

Pujols has played three games each in Oakland, Seattle and Texas (regular season), and overall he's 7-for-37 (.189) with one homer (at Seattle) and a whopping six RBIs. Not much to go on there. Small sample size and all that.

beer sales, especially for the big boys like AB-InBev and MillerCoors. Beer Marketer's Insights estimates that A-B InBev's volume fell 2.9 percent last year, and that less of its beer was purchased than has been in a decade. MillerCoors volume fell by roughly the same clip, though its biggest label – Coors Light – grew through aggressive marketing and broader distribution, said Eric Shepard, the newsletter's executive editor. Coors Light's gain was small – just 0.8 percent – but that was enough for it to finally top Budweiser.
"There is a huge disconnect between what girls say they are interested in and what they eventually wind up doing career-wise," said Kamla Modi, research and outreach analyst for the Greater Chicago Girls Scouts organization. "We started our science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) research a year ago, and our findings show that there are a lot of stereotypes out there about what girls should or shouldn't do career wise, even though they are just as strong as males in the fields of science and math. Girls lack role models in the field."
Last week, NBC debuted its riskiest 10 p.m. Thursday proposition yet -- "Awake." Created by Kyle Killen, who was also responsible for the hugely promising, swiftly canceled series, "Lone Star," "Awake" has a tricky premise. The series premiere last week began with an awful car crash. Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs of "Harry Potter" movie fame) survives, but wakes to two separate realities. In one, his wife has died, and his son survives; in the other, the son died, and his wife still lives.
Similarly, the new deputy mayor for education must be charged with reaching consensus of what defines educational excellence in all of Marion County. For example, the majority of black students in Marion County attend non-IPS schools, which are also performing at less-than-stellar levels. Why have charters been placed almost exclusively in the IPS district? Don't the parents and students in the rest of Marion County also deserve excellence-driven choices in public education? When does the county reach a saturation level for charters?

Nugent, 63, who was born in Detroit but now lives in Texas, was cleared of being a threat to President Barack Obama after meeting last Thursday with two members of the Secret Service in Oklahoma. The meeting was ordered following Nugent's comments during an NRA convention the previous weekend, where he said he'd "either be dead or in jail by this time next year" if Obama wins in November. Although the Secret Service didn't issue a statement following Thursday's meeting, Nugent called it a "good, solid, professional meeting concluding that I have never made any threats of violence towards anyone. The meeting could not have gone better."

That competitive edge gave Paterno a vigor that many coaches half his age sometimes seemed to lack. Well into his 70s he continued to run onto the field with his players, dressed in his trademark khakis, black cleats and blue Penn State jacket. But in the last few years, Paterno was seen more in the press box than with his team on the field. In 2006 he suffered a broken leg in a sideline collision during a game against Wisconsin. Two years later he injured a hip demonstrating an onside kick. And in August of last year suffered further injuries to his hip and leg when he was accidentally hit during a drill in practice.

When I look back at how my mother raised the six of us, certain parts of the story merit more attention: the sacrifices made, the meals cooked, the love freely given. The glossed-over history creates an impossible yardstick by which to measure one own's performance as mother, but it also fills my heart. I know my mistakes as a mother will be different than hers. But I hope my children grow up as secure in my love as I have always been in hers. I hope my children look back at the stories of their childhood with the same kindness and selectiveness of memory that I do my own.

One hot day last summer Home & Garden editor, Deb Wandell and I got calls from security. Our bees had swarmed into a company parking lot. We put on our suits, acted like we knew what we were doing, and scooped the bees with gloved hands into a cardboard box, using a piece of sticky honeycomb as a lure. I posted an ad on Craigslist, and two women from Oakland who manage a foraging website came by that day to retrieve them.

Californians never quite warmed to Brown's first call for austerity - and some remarkable waves of prosperity in the 1980s and 1990s renewed the state's sense of destiny, and a growth in its budget.

In the end, I hope readers appreciate a well-turned phrase, especially one that causes them to rethink their position.
So it is time to stop invoking Greece as a cautionary tale about the dangers of deficits; from an American point of view, Greece should instead be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of trying to reduce deficits too quickly, while the economy is still deeply depressed.

The passages in the film showing his final years are tremendously touching. He began to seek treatment when it was already probably too late, and continued to tour even though his fans noted with concern his weight loss and increasingly frail appearance.

Some take Romney's reticence to challenge the right as evidence that he is the "severe conservative" he claimed to be. I suspect it has more to do with weakness: He has been so abused by the right for so long that he lacks the confidence to offend conservatives.

Despite all this, the insurance companies and their allies don't like this idea. They argue that these private companies can't fairly compete with the government. And they'd be right if taxpayers were subsidizing this public insurance option. But they won't be. I have insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects. But by avoiding some of the overhead that gets eaten up at private companies by profits, excessive administrative costs and executive salaries, it could provide a good deal for consumers. It would also keep pressure on private insurers to keep their policies affordable and treat their customers better, the same way public colleges and universities provide additional choice and competition to students without in any way inhibiting a vibrant system of private colleges and universities.

On the website of Iraq Veterans Against the War, organizer Aaron Hughes declared that Afghan war veterans "believe that this incident is not a case of one 'bad apple' but the effect of a continued U.S. military policy of drone strikes, night raids, and helicopter attacks where Afghan civilians pay the price."

Greek sources and some archaeological evidence suggest they arrived on the west coast of Sicily from Asia Minor around 1300 BC, which tends to support legends identifying the first Elymians as the band of refugees from the Fall of Troy whose adventures were told in Virgil's "Aeneid."

From the voluminous menu in Hungarian, English and Italian (the cafe now is under Italian management), we ordered what may be the best pastry deal in town: the "Hungarian cake selection." It included an Esterhazy torte (walnut cake with white chocolate fondant on top), an almond and apple cream pastry called an almaspite and a Dobos torte — but, alas, no Sacher torte, so the epic rematch would have to wait. "That is Dobos!" Edie exclaimed after her first bite. I asked her if she could imagine her grandfather Vilmos hanging out at the New York. "Oh, yes," she replied, "very definitely. I can picture him talking and joking. He was a man who enjoyed life." A century later, we were enjoying life too.
