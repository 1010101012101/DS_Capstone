A student's voluntary removal, or withdrawal from school, "as a practical matter, serves the same as expulsion would serve, in terms of removing the person from the community," Geller said.

At times he appeared to revert to his role as chief executive of Bain Capital, the Boston-based financial services firm, as when he demanded of a business owner complaining about his taxes, "Are you an LLC or a Sub-S?" (He was referring to different legal categories of companies.)
Mike Haridopolos: Victim. After taking a lot of flak for the $152,000 in public money that our Senate president scarfed up for writing a book full of simplistic pablum, he must have craved a sympathetic ear. Well, he found one at Newsmax.com, where a hard-hitting interviewer asked if the hubbub was really just a "nonissue." (When liberals need a sympathetic ear, they go on MSNBC. When conservatives need one they go to Fox. When they can't get on Fox, they go to Newsmax.) Haridopolos suggested the real reason people were going after him was because he was "trying to change America." Really? So it wasn't because you were taking a bunch of tax money while telling other people they needed to sacrifice? Oh, sorry. Our bad. (You can see the video of this one yourself in the latest installment of the Malarkey Meter at OrlandoSentinel.com/takingnames.)
Current rules require members to state their conflicts of interest -- even possible conflicts -- on the floor or in a committee where a bill is considered. Sometimes lawmakers stand up at the slightest hint of a problem -- "My wife is a dentist" on dentistry legislation, for example.
It was the first of his two interceptions. The second he returned 40 yards for a touchdown, the final Redskins indignity in their 59-28 loss. On Comcast SportsNet's "Daily News Live" the other day, Brian Baldinger lauded Patterson's confidence and fortitude to be in position to make those plays, so soon after he was burned. Lots of guys in Patterson's position, he said, would play soft, especially if they were filling the position for an injured starter, the way Patterson was.
Over the span of three years, the writer-star interviewed a great number of seekers about their online dating experiences. Video images of her supporting cast — straight, gay, girl, guy, white, ethnic, a gamut — talking about their experiences are projected on the wall of her apartment.
"There will be times when it will be cap related on a big trade or at the trade deadline, and maybe going into the next draft, but the role is expanding a little bit," Penn said. "My primary focus during the season now is shining a light on the advance statistical stuff that goes on, going beyond the boxscore in analyzing players and teams.
For the students, it made sense to form a club where they could teach each other life skills, for dorm life and beyond. For some of their peers, more responsibility is a reality as they play the mini-parent role and baby-sit siblings or cook family meals. Since Aloha no longer offers such a course, they opted to teach themselves.
And then there’s the economy. Nursing has consistently been ranked among the professions with the highest amount of projected job growth in the next 20 years.
Harang left after six innings, allowing the three runs on six hits and four walks. He struck out two. Minor also went six innings and allowed his three runs and eight hits; he did not walk a batter and struck out two.
Stewart was upset because a caution for debris — he claimed it was for a bottle of soda or water that wasn’t an on-track hindrance — erased his lead with 13 laps remaining. He led the leaders down pit road for a final stop, and Busch beat him back onto the track.

Another neighbor, Dorian Balla, 29, described Pervaiz as "a really good guy." Noorani was quiet and would always say hello, but wasn’t around as much, he said. Balla recounted one incident three or four months ago in which the couple had a heated argument and police were called to the apartment.
Vas’s defense attorneys argued that federal prosecutor’s failed to prove that the former four-term mayor and state Assemblyman improperly flipped a 12-unit apartment in Perth Amboy for a profit of nearly $300,000, then funneled $80,000 of that profit into his unsuccessful 2009 congressional campaign.
The survey has critics, though, because it only targeted households with landlines.
Most importantly, cell phone companies do their best to tie subscribers up with contracts. AT&T executives last year stressed to investors that most of their iPhone users are on family and employer plans -- more difficult for an individual to switch from.

Sadly, many of my most prominent memories relate to watching her began to slip away. Fragility and forgetfulness led to dementia over the years. Her upscale apartment at an assisted living facility eventually became a bed in a Spartan room shared with a mentally handicapped woman.
On April 1, a Justice Department memorandum devoted many words to refuting what no one is disputing, that presidents have the power to initiate military action without Congress' permission. The WPR assumes this with its 48-hour and 60- and 90-day deadlines. The memorandum reaches the conclusion the president wants by arguing as follows: By allowing US involvement in hostilities to continue for 60 or 90 days, Congress "signaled" that it considers congressional authorization "most critical" for "major, prolonged conflicts" such as Korea and Vietnam.

Authorities have not charged any with espionage, a far more serious count. But authorities portray the defendants as classic Cold War-style moles bent on infiltrating American business and government circles to hunt for information.

"Two years ago we were state champions but last year in many respects was even more special," Holtmeier said. "When we went to the state tournament we only qualified four golfers (instead of five) which is quite a handicap. Those four golfers overcame a lot and to get second place in that situation was amazing. The guys felt it was the equivalent to winning another state championship."

Turns out that when you go to a Las Vegas Bowl (and not a Rose Bowl) and don’t have a high-profile sneaker donor backing you, that most of us are not interested in the news unless its big stuff. And let’s not make this about OSU having clean hands under Riley, because we all remember run-ins with a taxi-cab driver, a sheep and a National Guardsman.

And for a low-key New Year's Eve that's more about comfort than caviar, pot-au-feu - "the pot on the fire" - hits just the right note. It simmers slowly all day, perfuming the house with warm, beefy aromas. And leftovers to tide you through New Year's Day are all but assured.

Nothing will be scrutinized more this spring than the quarterback competition among Kevin Prince, Richard Brehaut, Brett Hundley and T.J. Millweard. Injuries had Prince and Brehaut alternating last season.
Of course the more pressing question is not when to take down the tinsel. The more important questions concern how the light of Christmas faith will flood the dark places of the our world throughout the New Year. The New Year will bring its share of scandals and tragedies. It occurs to me that spending some time with portions of the less frequently read narratives of Jesus' infancy and childhood may provide a few reminders of how people of faith have allowed the light of God to shine in the darkness-even when the old C7 bulbs no longer twinkle.
Reader Nancy Hicks tells another story of crewmember callousness. She was flying with crutches after a recent foot operation, and notified United Airlines she'd need a wheelchair at the airport. Instead, she was greeted by a "surly" skycap who waved her into the terminal without trying to help.

Brian Swanson, another PG&E spokesman, said crews were patrolling the line with handheld helium detectors. "We said at the start it might take a couple days to pinpoint the exact location," Swanson said.
Personally, I have a lot of sympathy for Perry. I couldn't believe the way people made a big deal when he forgot the name of that third agency he wanted to get rid of. His brain froze up. That can happen to anybody. It's like forgetting your phone number. Or the password to the computer.
Here's what history says the Broncos should do with their first-round pick, the No. 25 slot: Take a DEFENSIVE TACKLE already! In the past five seasons, the Broncos' run defense has ranked 22nd (in 2011), 31st, 26th, 27th and 30th.

An investigation by The Oregonian last year found the investment officers routinely accepted high-end travel at the expense of those firms, which earned nearly $300 million in fees from the pension fund in 2009. The state has never asked for an accounting of those travel costs, sometimes incurred at the world's premier hotels, resorts and restaurants.
While explicitly discussing the campaign, Mr. Brennan was cautious in his language, experts noted. He didn't mention the CIA by name and carefully outlined precautions that are taken in the strikes.

Heck, the Yankees need only look across the field today where the Rays, despite the AL’s third-lowest payroll, are viewed as a World Series contender. That is because they have five starters so good — none worse than a No. 3 — that Wade Davis was moved to the bullpen.

Two is that Denver is a weather Siberia. Yes, there are snowstorms in March. But it's as likely, if not more likely, to be 65 and sunny on Christmas Eve. Denver gets 300 sunny days a year. It's not like playing in a dome half the year, but it's not Buffalo or Foxborough, either.

11:42 a.m. We enter, and right away the vibe — light but maybe a touch more formal than most Mexican places I'm familiar with — suggests we're in for a treat. The music track is just loud enough to set a mood. White tablecloths contrast with solid, bold yellows and blues that dominate the interior color scheme. We're walked through the main dining room and into a brighter side room that has a patio feel, though it's enclosed.

Is Rose just a tad bit too much of a billboard for the progressive times she's supposed to embody? (She's bringing home a Picasso from a trip to France, and she's a follower of an Austrian fellow named Freud.) Is Billy Zane missing only a waxed mustache to twirl as her shallow and controlling fiance, Cal Hockley? Does Winslet  one year younger than DiCaprio  still possess a womanly maturity that makes Rose's dependence on Jack hard to believe?
"Lara's Theme" from "Zhivago" -- Jarre's most popular tune, which helped drive the soundtrack to No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 1966 -- isn't particularly Russian in character. It was designed to convey the love between Yuri (Omar Sharif) and Lara (Julie Christie) that transcended time and place. Lost in all the attention to "Lara's Theme" is the fact that Jarre's complete score is filled with Russian flavor, not only in the melodies but also in the 24 balalaikas and 40-man chorus that augmented the MGM orchestra in Culver City.
An initiative might be possible, since initiatives add new laws or change existing laws, but the wording of a new law to cancel the eventual contract and bring back a previous contractor would be convoluted, difficult to sell to voters and could be unconstitutional.

The gold-standard clinical trials that would properly figure out the relationship -- get a huge group of people, randomly select half of them to brush and floss diligently, let the others develop gum disease, then track the outcomes over years and years -- would be expensive and unwieldy and aren't likely to ever be done.

One feature that distinguishes my product is that I begin with a sturdy, primed and framed canvas, not simply a sheet of paper. Working with the customer, we determine the appropriate size, which usually depends on how many guests they've invited. Each tree is hand-painted in watercolor and can be customized to include "carved" initials in the tree trunk, plus the bride and groom's names and the date of the event on the bottom. I can even re-create a specific typeface that the couple may be using in their invitations, etc. Additional items can be added onto the branches, such as the two cardinals shown here, which were created from my niece and nephew's thumbprints. I use a sturdy, well-lighted easel to display the canvas at the wedding reception. Multiple colors of ink stamp pads, displayed on an adjacent table, will give signees an option on how to leave their mark, while creating a mottled effect with the leaves. I also recommend having a tub of moist towelettes on the table so signees can clean their thumbs after leaving their imprint. Having the immediate wedding party 'sign in" first is a good way to get the process started.

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA
Fettled in his modest workshop in Mannheim, Germany, Benz's Patent Motorwagen didn't look much like a car as we know it today. To the town's mildly alarmed burghers, it didn't even immediately suggest a horseless carriage, whatever that was. With its spoked rear wheels and tuck-and-roll upholstered seat, it looked rather more like a park bench gone walkabout. But it was, in all the ways that matter, the first proper automobile. This was the life-evoking lightning stroke in the primordial pond, the rudimentary sorting of nucleotides from which a new species would arise. It was only a matter of time before real estate agents driving three-ton Escalades would overrun the Westside.
That happened years ago. Some things change, but others remain the same, as Harris reminded me.

The NBA early entry deadline is April 10. I don't think Burke will leave -- as talented as he is, he is a 5-11 freshman guard in a deep draft. He is not smitten by the NBA like previous point guard Darius Morris (and the voices in Morris' ear). I don't think Burke will leave until he is a sure first-round pick, at minimum -- and right now, he is probably a second-round pick.

Specifically, a wide cross-section of liberal and conservative Catholics have united in opposition to a Jan. 20 rule issued by the federal Department of Health and Human Services as part of the implementation of "Obamacare." The rule requires almost all private health insurance plans to provide coverage for all U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved prescription contraceptives. Health plans would also have to offer female sterilization as yet another "preventive service." Companies would have to cover these things fully, with no co-pay for the patient. The penalty for employers who purchase health plans that don't comply with the rule is about $2,000 per employee.

Eva Carrozza: This piece from Romeo and Juliet is a march -- so excellent stand-in for an actual Paso Doble. The fangs? Amongst my viewing party, people liked it, and perhaps it was an inspiration because Maria and Derek gave an awesome performance without having to lay on the floor or kiss each other. The whole concept worked because they were totally committed to it. The steps should evoke the intensity and movements of bull-fighting and that was all there. Maria looked like a pro with both her frame and body look. If they haven't already done so, they should lock loins. The dancing earned a 10.

It is funny, it is sad. It is directly emotive, it is highly sophisticated. It is full of good tunes and doesn't go on too long. "La Bohème" appeals to young people who see themselves in the characters and to older audiences for whom it calls back the shadows of soirees past. We recognize its heroes and heroines: Didn't we just see poet Rodolfo in a Silver Lake cafe? Or philosopher Colline, buried in the stacks of the library? And might that have been lost, ailing Mimi we passed the other evening on Hollywood Boulevard?
I’ve only managed to read the prologue, and already, I’m very afraid. It reads like something from the Book of Revelation. It probably should be required reading for today's parents, whose children will eventually use the tools of social media to perform stunning end-runs around house rules, children who will go to Google before ever thinking to consult the people who gave birth to them.
Chandon and Mumm employ strategies more typical of Champagne's biggest houses. Though Chandon owns an estimated 1,050 acres of vineyard land in Carneros, Mount Veeder and Yountville, it contracts for a significant amount of the grapes used in its wines, though it would not provide exact numbers. And while Mumm controls 110 acres in Carneros that supply about 15 percent of its grapes, it contracts for the rest from as many as 120 plots from American Canyon to Rutherford.

Markets battered Italy this past week amid uncertainty that Berlusconi would really leave and questions over whether Italy's notoriously paralyzed parliament could rally around a replacement.

The opening shot of "Horton Hears a Who!" -- droplets of water on a green leaf -- looks a lot like "A Bug's Life." This may be less a coincidence than a case of collegial teasing -- the animators at Blue Sky Studios reminding Pixar that it's not the only power in the computer-animated jungle. In fact, Blue Sky, the company that made the "Ice Age" features, has staked out its own distinctive style -- soft, glowing colors, eccentric, semi-pneumatic figures and, yes, lovely blue skies. The style works extremely well in this endearing, though sometimes belabored, feature version of the Dr. Seuss classic. (Chuck Jones did a TV version in 1970.) And the film, which stars Jim Carrey as the voice of Horton the elephant -- other voices are done by Steve Carell and Carol Burnett -- turns enchanting when it plunges from the jungle of Nool into the cheerful pandemonium of Who-ville, the microscopic civilization atop the white speck that Horton finds perched on a pink clover blossom.

3. In January, there were complaints about a championship rematch in the Superdome between LSU and Alabama. That was football.

If anyone deserves extraordinary treatment during Valentine's season, certainly our furry buddies do.
Both Obama and McCain used Iraq as the prime differentiator between themselves and the rest of their respective primary fields. Obama, of course, was the only major Democratic candidate who opposed the war from the beginning, a position that built the grass-roots effort that ultimately brought him his party's nomination. McCain's campaign was close to extinction when his ongoing support for an increased U.S. troop presence there began to fuel his comeback against a Republican field that had left him in the dust.

In his book "Situations Matter," Tufts University professor Sam Sommers writes how crowds and the power of conformity inhibit people from helping someone in need. Both dynamics operate for children and adults, but children urgently feel the need to be part of a group and are unlikely to separate themselves from a group.

And if minority students are being unfairly singled out for punishment, the department neither proved it nor provided much guidance for how to protect them. If a solid study shows that that is the case, then the department should use its full powers to end such practices as a violation of students' civil rights.
