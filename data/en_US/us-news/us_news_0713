I like it. Even though I think this minimalism has its limits. I can't imagine a truly muscular app (like iPhoto for the iPhone) translating to the Zen rock garden of Windows Phone. But let's be fair: I'm talking about about a rare kind of high-level app that aims to be as functional as a desktop app. Many -- I want to guess "most" -- users value serenity and clarity as highly as they value those "post PC"-style apps.

To date, ultrasonic transmitters have been implanted into more than 160 fish (below the barrier, both Asian carp and surrogate species are tagged; above the barrier, only surrogate species are tagged), with about another 40 fish to be tagged this the summer. Thirty-two stationary receivers collect tracking data from the tags, supplemented by mobile tracking to identify the locations of the tagged fish. Tags also were implanted into small surrogate species (2.1 inches to 7.5 inches) and released directly above and below Barrier 2B in order to assess barrier efficacy on smaller sizes of fish.

A: We have some good ideas about it, but like a lot of cancers, we are still struggling for answers. We know that testosterone plays a major role in prostate cancer. It's one of the major factors. Heredity also can be a factor. A man has a higher risk of developing it if their father had the disease. And the older you get, the more likely you are to develop prostate cancer. If you review autopsies of gentlemen in their 80s, you'll find that the majority had microscopic cancer cells in their prostate.

Natalia played about half a game for every league game, and Mychael noted that her numbers don't reflect her true accomplishments on the court. He made reading the paper each week more fun than you can imagine. The fact that he wrote so glowingly about her made Natalia that much more determined not to let anyone down. He, too, inspired her.

The spotlight and hype aside, Carlo’s City Hall Bake Shop (95 Washington St., Hoboken; 201-659-2671) is actually a pretty good bakery.

I can envision an NRA-backed law giving homeowners the right to shoot any big-eared mammals of the genus Oryctolagus that enter their homes for the purpose of leaving chocolates and brightly colored eggs on a certain religious holiday.

David Archuleta: Little Mr. Frontrunner does a surprisingly bad version of "We Can Work it Out," stumbling over the lyrics, sounding ill-at-ease and stuck with an old-fogey arrangement (those back-up singers were a corny, totally unneeded touch). The judges don't hold back: Randy says he was "not on point"; Paula says he should never let it show on his face when he forgets the lyrics; and Simon makes a point of saying he needs to treat everybody equally, and "that was a mess," David's weakest performance so far.

President Bush found himself basing foreign policy too much on personal relationships rather than on the complex and often messy issues of state. Although chemistry between leaders is a potent and vital ingredient in foreign policy, Bush's over-reliance on personal dynamics made the U.S. too pliant with some friends and too rigid with some adversaries.

This film, directed by Lee Hirsch, follows the real-life stories of five bullied kids over the course of a school year. It's a story kids everywhere should see.

According to the MPAA, the primary reason it got an R rating was because of the repetition of the "F word" in one scene.

Ty Lawson: The Nuggets point guard has this squat frame that belies his ridiculous speed. He's as fast as anyone end to end with a ball in his hand. But he's more than that.

To make the movie itself was an act of defiance and, for the South Africans involved, true courage.

-- I have no idea what Porter was thinking when he dragged down Nicks on the sideline for a hit out of bounds that should've led to a Giants score late in the first half. He was chasing Nicks toward the sideline, so he was clearly aware of where he was on the field. Or at least he should've been. Unreal the Giants couldn't cash that one in. A false start on C David Baas, two drops and a pressure forcing Manning to throw it away killed any chances and gave the Saints the ball back for their 34-second drive that really changed this game for good.

My generation knew play as a verb without object. "I'm going out to play" was a complete thought. Intransitive play could, of course, take shape, develop structure, become a game.

Then, On Nov. 5, a Saturday, the O'Connor family was watching TV when they noticed a crawl across the bottom of the screen making reference to child sexual abuse and the Penn State football program. Within a week, O'Connor would decommit, his world turned upside down, not sure who he would be casting his lot with come Feb. 1, national signing day.
"I noticed these guys are unloading fast and staying fast," Wallace said. "They are well prepared when they get to the track and he's driving smart and aggressive and taking advantage of these good long runs that NASCAR is having. I'm proud to see how good he's running."
It was Angela Merkel. The German chancellor and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were about to meet in Berlin to deal with Greece's debt crisis and were at odds over what losses investors might be forced to take. They hoped the ECB could broker a compromise.
"It's all the same to me," Wolfe said of the different positions. "I'll do what they want to do. I'll do whatever I have to do to win.
As in the U.K., a capital-gains tax (impôt sur les plus values) is charged to individuals selling a secondary residence. French residents pay the equivalent of 26% tax—16% capital-gains tax, plus 10% special social-security contribution. For those who live elsewhere in the EU, a standard rate of 16% applies. For non-EU tax residents, it is much steeper—33.3%
Warriors assistant coach Michael Malone is expected to interview for the Bobcats' head-coaching vacancy Tuesday, according to Yahoo.
"If it helps at all, it probably has only a very minor effect on depression," he says. "It seemed promising on basis of early studies, but these just weren't well-designed."
The credits also draw plenty of doubters. Robert Tannenbaum, who wrote a recent report on them for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said states often lose money on these incentives. He pointed to a Massachusetts study that found the state only gained
"Would I like to be in the same offense I was in my rookie year and be going into year three? Yeah, but that's not the case," Bradford said. "I think going through the past two years will make this transition easier. I know what it's like. I know what it was like to learn an offense as a rookie and last year, learning McDaniels' offense, I think both those experiences will make this easier and I'm looking forward to it."
Policy experts say the health-care issues reflect a larger social and economic shift involving the middle class. There is no guarantee that care will be there when it's needed.
Unfortunately, the national campaigns have veered toward the nasty and the silly this year. Romney survived the primary season thanks in part to super PACs and campaign spending that crushed his long line of rivals with negative commercials. Both parties seem to believe this election will be won by the one who does the best job of destroying the other. With that in mind it's worth remembering that whether you like him or not, Daniels ran two successful campaigns for governor that were heavy on positive messages and policy ideas. He said political victories that follow "slash-and-burn" campaigns seldom lead to great accomplishments.
The concern among Jewish groups was mostly about proselytization. Judaism, unlike Christianity and Islam, is not an evangelical faith. Countless hours have been spent in interfaith dialogue to ensure that Catholics do not aggressively proselytize to Jews. It's a delicate subject because evangelism is at the core of how Christians interpret Christ's final message to his apostles.
But those are easy subjects to ridicule. It would have been more satisfying to see Goldthwait go after something a little less obvious, to make Frank a little more conflicted. Murray is quite good, a sort of built-in sadness coloring his frustrations and his actions. That's crucial because, without liking him even a little, the movie would be insufferable. (Barr is good, as well.)
Russo testified against Dimora as a provision of a plea agreement that called for him to cooperate with federal officials. He previously pleaded guilty to 21 corruption-related charges, and was sentenced to nearly 22 years in prison, but hopes to reduce that punishment.
Trout's opportunity will come at someone's expense — and not just Arte Moreno's because of the $9 million the Angels still owe Bobby Abreu after releasing the veteran to make room for Trout on Friday.
"He had completed his return on the Web and never reviewed it before filing it," Reed said. "It's important to check every item on your tax return."
“I want cookies.”
After a buoyant first act depicting the couple's courtship, the show turns dark and tedious as it depicts Johnny's descent into alcoholism. But, much like Johnny, the musical remains endearing. Songs like "Make the Man Love Me," "Love Is the Reason" and "If You Haven't Got a Sweetheart" boast Arthur Schwartz's tuneful music and Dorothy Fields' emotionally direct lyrics, and remain enchanting even when rendered only by piano, violin and drums.
Nobody returned to patch the asphalt, leaving a two-lane street with one lane closed at an intersection. "It's really unsafe," the Beachwood man said.
This is a perfect opponent for the Lakers to open defense of their 2010-11 second-round sweep. Denver will permit the Lakers to find their postseason legs, warm their hamstrings and, eventually perhaps, even withstand a little late-game distress.
BP said the bottom kill could take days or weeks, depending on how well the static kill works, meaning it will be mid-August before the well is plugged for good.
Rancher Louie Molt sells hay, runs an organic farm and a land-leveling company on his 300-acre ranch in Burns. Several years ago, he opened his own restaurant, the Meat Hook Steak House, to sell the meat he raises to reap a bigger profit.

2011-12 season: In his second season since transferring from Eastern Arizona Junior College, James was named to the all-Southland Conference first team after averaging 16.8 points a game to finish third in league scoring.

With this proposed increase, we will have increased aid to New Jersey schools by over $1 billion in the two years since I took office.
But a funny thing happened on the way to being laid off again. Of course I made connections. I made friends. Even though they knew I was a temp, my new district invested in me with many hours of professional development and, most recently, accepted me into a 1:1 iPad trial. In April, each of my students received an iPad for school use! Since my first career was in high tech, being able to meld technology and education is a passion for me. They found my sweet spot.
An elegant entrance and heavily treed boulevard greets residents and guests while rolling hills and treed surroundings enhance 60 acres of natural open space throughout Bluestem, resulting in a rustic charm that extends into a welcoming setting, according to Dennis Patterson, community manager for Prime Development. Yet Bluestem’s prime Overland Park location reflects the modern convenience available thanks to proximity to shops, entertainment, services and award-winning Blue Valley schools.
Wednesday's vote was 5-0, with city Commissioner Dan Saltzman phoning in from New York, where he's on vacation. City commissioners also approved a 12 percent increase in water rates, and a 6.35 percent increase in sewer and stormwater rates.
NEW YORK — Concerns over Wall Street practices and economic inequality that have led to sit-ins and rallies in New York and elsewhere reverberated up to the White House on Thursday, with President Barack Obama saying the protesters are expressing the frustrations of the American public.
"Everyone there is a superstar," said Loehr. "If they wanted to win, they'd have to put their egos aside and view the mission through the eyes of the team itself. The players will need to decide if they're a bunch of individuals displaying their greatness in a helter-skelter game, or if they want to play selfless ball and probably crush their opponents."
Richards put the Kings up 3-1 with a sharp-angled shot that somehow trickled through Elliott for his third goal of the postseason. The Blues went roughly 10 minutes without a shot spanning the second and third periods, but Stewart trimmed the Kings' lead back to one goal by diving to tap home a rare loose rebound off Quick with 15:25 to play for his second career multigoal playoff game.
You may not recognize the names of the performers at this festival, but you will recognize their songs. This intimate festival is spread across Music City's legendary nightclub venues as a one-of-a-kind event showcasing the writers of the songs instead of the singers who made them famous. The moniker is a reference to Tin Pan Alley from New York City's heyday of music publishing, a trend that has shifted south to Nashville in recent decades. Many shows are in-the-round performances with different songwriters, and the crowds tend to show up early to claim the best seats at each venue. www.tinpansouth.com
Jazz from an Eastwood. Kyle Eastwood plays moody, fluid electric and acoustic bass lines that could easily be used in film dramas. Actually, some of his music has been deatured in movies directed by his father, Clint Eastwood. The younger Eastwood gave acting a shot, appearing opposite his dad in 1982's "Honkytonk Man" before deciding to go for jazz as a full-time profession.
Earlier, the Labor Department said applications for unemployment benefits dipped 2,000 to 386,000. When the number is above 375,000, investors take it as a sign that hiring isn't strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.

This dilemma is the product of political compromise. The administration couldn't get the votes for a single-payer system such as Medicare for all. Not a single Republican would even agree to a bill giving Americans the option of buying into it.
"I know Joe hurts every bit as bad as I do. Just like me up here, I smile and I show that I'm happy and everything's going great when my stomach down inside is sometimes in a knot," Fickell said from his news conference podium. "No, that's not something you want to see. Whether he was disguising or masking how his gut felt, I have confidence that Joe hurts every bit as much as I hurt. We try and tell those guys, nothing goes unnoticed whether it's on the sidelines of a game, whether it's in a classroom, wherever you are having something to eat. Just make sure you understand that. But I haven't noticed anything that would tell me that Joe isn't 100 percent with us."

"Given a personal choice, I would not have returned these officers to duty," Safety Director Marty Flask said in an interview. "The nature and seriousness of the allegations deserve thorough investigation and resolution."
Remember, cold hits us harder as we age, especially when the temperature drops below freezing. Older adults often have poor circulation, less body fat and muscle and less ability to generate heat, so they feel the cold more severely. Additionally, about 10 percent of people older than 65 have a temperature-regulating defect, making them more susceptible to the effects of cold.

The defendants are banned from offering free trials to consumers as part of the settlement.
Together, Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg are overseeing some of the most radical cuts to government spending in the world. Not surprisingly, tensions have appeared, though not really between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, but among Conservatives themselves -- notably between George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, and former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the secretary of state for work and pensions. The two men, at times swearing at each other across the Cabinet table, disagree about how to reconcile severe spending cuts with tackling poverty. But disagreement between the treasury and a big-spending department is only natural. Indeed, it's healthy. It's what a Cabinet is for. After all, politics is about advancing the public interest through conflict followed by compromise.
He said he has come to believe, however, that things happen for a reason, "that maybe something good can come from all of this. Maybe it's our responsibility, maybe it's your responsibility, to see that something does."
"I've come to the conclusion that the reason you won't make "The Maccabbes" is the ugliest possible one," Eszterhas writes. "You hate Jews." Eszterhas then catalogues a long list of anti-Semitic comments and slurs made by Gibson in his presence, including calling Jews "oven-dodgers," insisting that the Holocaust was "mostly" bull, and that the Torah referenced the sacrifice of Christian babies. Gibson also reportedly called Pope John Paul II "the anti-Christ," and went into explosive rages about Grigorieva, including threatening to rape and kill Grigorieva. There's much, much more.

"I'm going on tour with Enrique Iglesias in June," Spears told GMA host Robin Roberts during a backstage interview.
2. If you remember anything from the 2008 title game, the stat you want to know about Monday is free-throw shooting. Memphis, shooting 59 percent from the line as a team, went 12-for-19 (63 percent) and missed four of five free throws down the stretch as Kansas rallied to force overtime and then claim the victory.
Calf ranches in dairy-intensive areas, such as those in Tulare and Kings counties, do give antibiotics to calves. When the calves are pre-weaned or newly weaned from their mothers, farmers give antibiotics to help prevent illnesses such as diarrhea, which can be fatal.

If I hadn't eaten these dishes before, I would have liked them on this visit, but these were merely rote imitations of what Sung did; they lacked the precision and careful balance that he brought to each combination in the early years of the restaurant. The calamari was a little flabby, the lemon zest a little too prominent, and the sauce a little less subtle.
'We think it will entice people," Polk County Sheriff Bob Wolfe said Monday. His department is joining forces with Oregon State Police and the FBI to look into the case of Glenn Warren Pennie, 56, who is believed to be the victim of foul play.

Eventually, the government hopes, GM can return to profitability, which would allow the government to sell its GM stock. But the risks for taxpayers are daunting, with U.S. auto sales near their lowest level in 27 years.
Coal burned in Asia also comes back to haunt us in the form of toxic emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and 50 other toxic compounds. These toxics ride the trade winds and settle on our land and wash off into rivers, lakes and reservoirs, contaminating the fish we eat and the water we drink.

"They're saying the quality of the fishery has declined substantially, 60 percent since 1985," said Dean Billington, whose Bull Basin Outfitters operation sits in the heart of the upper Colorado's Gold Medal fishery above the Troublesome Creek confluence.

If you're thinking about replacing or adding a ceiling fan to combat the sweltering heat to come and take some pressure off your air conditioning unit, this is an option for the long haul. You don't have to worry about clockwise or counterclockwise spinning. The Reiker Room Conditioner (starting $319-$349 at fanheatlight.com) operates and installs like a ceiling fan, but it contains four ceramic heating elements housed in the fan unit. A computer-controlled transmitter senses room temperature and adjusts, so you don't have to worry about doing anything special if we get a cold snap one night. Reiker says that the room conditioner can heat a 20-by-20-foot room using less energy than typical portable heaters.

Hill's reputation for unpredictability precedes her. She's been late to major engagements several times, and she's pulled the plug on others. The pop star passed out onstage during her 2009 European festival swing, and later cancelled all the remaining concerts on the tour. That said, Hill's five-song performance at SOPAC this June was dynamic. Her excellent band reimagined the tracks from "Miseducation," teasing new melodies and new rhythms out of the decade-old material. She did not, in any way, seem like a rusty performer: on the contrary, she sang like a star who'd rehearsed and thought hard about her material. Hill also sang at the massive Rock the Bells concert at Randall's Island, which strongly suggested that this hip-hop legend is getting serious about public performance again.

Something extra: Seat yourself at the bar, and you can either sit at one of the high tables for a cozy drink or face the wall of liquor and the flat-screen TVs. If the weather is nice, however, try to make your way out to the patio and sit at an umbrella-covered table. You can enjoy a view of the pond with the dual waterfall on both sides, and the statues of moose among the greenery.Chicago Fire Pizza

A: Hey, @krowsboomtime: He really is there, for now. The best bet on the 6-3, 230-pound redshirt freshman is he will have a productive Ohio State career somewhere. Remember, as the Buckeyes prepared for the Sugar Bowl last season, teammates raved about Smith's size, speed and explosiveness. And they thought he was humble, too.
