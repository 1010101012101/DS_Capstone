The veteran rock guitarist isn’t above indulging in mid-Eighties lite-metal cliché. He still likes to punctuate verses with single, quavering, overdriven high notes. But on Wednesday night, his leads were particularly lyrical: his spotlight moment on “Wanted Dead Or Alive” demonstrated everything Sambora does well. He can still crash into a song like a stallion kicking down a barn door. When he slows down – which, admittedly, isn’t too often – his solos can be melodic, soaring, cathartic.
In total, the seven counties lost a net of 60,948 residents based on tax returns filed from 2005 through 2009, excluding moves within the seven counties and the next ring of adjacent counties -- Erie, Huron, Ashland, Wayne, Stark, Mahoning, Trumbull and Ashtabula.

One of the biggest reasons The X Factor is such a hit in The United Kingdom is the judging panel. Over seven seasons, judges have consisted of Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue (Kylie Minogue’s sister), Cheryl Cole (we will discuss later), and others you probably don’t know. The chemistry, and sometimes lack thereof, between the judges is one of the elements that makes The X Factor what it is.

But since then, we've seen President Barack Obama forced to compromise on an ill-considered mandate requiring religious institutions to provide contraception to their employees. We've seen the GOP convene an all-male panel to testify on women's reproductive concerns. We've seen debate over Title X, a 1970 law providing free contraception to indigent women. We've been treated to Rick Santorum's bizarre views on contraception, which he opposes because he says it doesn't work (!) and is dangerous and harmful to women, to boot.

“What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns,” Rushkoff wrote. “That's because, unlike a political campaign designed to get some person in office and then close up shop (as in the election of Obama), this is not a movement with a traditional narrative arc. As the product of the decentralized networked-era culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one-pointedness, but inclusion and groping toward consensus. It is not like a book; it is like the Internet.”

Brekken said there is nothing in the record that shows any of Mullins' employers reported his drug problems to the Nursing Board.

The truth is there are many forces that push us to do more. There are the performance measures that typically give doctors good grades for ordering tests, rather than for not ordering them. There is the legal system that will punish us for underdiagnosis, but not for overdiagnosis. There are the demands from patients seeking to get their money's worth from insurance after years of being taught to believe the best medical care is the most medical care. And there are the financial rewards: Most doctors, and/or the clinics and hospitals they work for, are paid more if they do more.

A: From early childhood, when my father hung a giant mural of a world map on my bedroom wall and gave me a shortwave radio, I have felt wanderlust. Traveling and meeting people in diverse places is a part of this urge, as is developing a more philosophical understanding of humanity and the world and myself.

The details: Amid all the candied, overwrought specimens of Zinfandel that have left their original partisans scowling, there's still room for hope. Look no further the 2008 Storybook Mountain Mayacamas Range Estate Napa Valley Zinfandel ($34, 14.7%), a savory, floral take on Napa Zin that smells like plums and tulips in a wooden window box.

Or look for the 2009 Bucklin Bambino Old Hill Ranch Sonoma Valley Zinfandel ($24, 15.2%), a young-vines effort from one of Sonoma's oldest vineyard sites. It's not only an homage to proper field blends (Petite Sirah, Alicante Bouschet and more appear), but it also offers that perfect mix of bramble fruit and dark pepper spice, with raspberry jam and bay leaf tones. Both are perfect choices for when holiday roasts come out to play.

When the basket of chips arrives at your table don't be surprised if they're still warm and doughy. They were probably just pulled out of the fryer and sprinkled with chipotle seasoning. The salsa is bright and filled with chunky pieces of tomatoes, onions and peppers. Do you like it hot? Just ask for something spicier and you'll be given two choices: roasted serrano or habanero salsa. Be sure to use the chips as a scoop while you devour the shrimp cocktail, which is more like ceviche.

Adam: When CM Punk walked into last year’s “Money in the Bank” as a villain, he received the loudest reaction of any fan favorites that night. Now, he’s returning home in the fight of his life against an opponent who has dragged him down a dark path of memories.

Even with all their talent, though, the Chargers' path to the state meet remains rugged. They will have to deal with some of the elite programs in the region to advance to the state meet.

Palomar spokesman Leonel Sanchez apparently sniffed at the number and said, "We generate $1.8 billion in gross revenues" and only "A small percentage (1.5%) of our revenues come from taxpayers." Well, Mr. Sanchez, those figures mean that the taxpayers give you $27 million per year (1.5%x$1.8 billion). That is nothing to sniff at. While you say you "heal" people, and you "feed" people, you certainly don't do so for free. I suggest you consider ending your practice of spending significant sums of taxpayer money for free parties for your personnel.

The reason I am writing about this great man in my sports column is because during his long career as a CEO of many hospitals, he always made sure his people found time to treat many athletes, both amateur and pro, during his many years of service.

Willamette Valley/Metro: Gill net test fishing reveals that a larger number of steelhead remain in the mainstem Columbia. Although some upriver spring chinook are appearing in both sport and test net fisheries, it's not the number most were expecting for this time of year. Although the fish may be present, strong sport catches are not reflecting this, likely because of cold water conditions. Catches should continue to ramp up with the last week of March and the first week of April to produce good catches as long as the season stays open.

I think it hurt everyone, Pioli said. Obviously no one had it, so it impacts everybody. I do think it may have impacted us a little bit differently than some maybe veteran teams because we had a group of guys that we drafted in 2010 that was a good class, we brought them in, they had their rookie minicamp, they had that little part of the offseason program, they had training camp, a season, and then the brakes are thrown on. So their development was held up a little bit.

To be clear, I don't object to Disney on moral grounds. I love Disneyland and have been a season passholder for years. We even spent last Mother's Day at the Disneyland Hotel. That may be part of the reason my family and I were so disappointed by Disney World: We're spoiled. We live in Southern California with theme parks, world-class zoos, Seaworld and even a wild animal park all within driving distance. And certainly the encyclopedic travel guides and websites devoted to Disney World are proof enough that people are besotted with the place.

Rinne was 43-18 with a 2.39 GAA. Howard was 35-17 with a 2.13 GAA. In their playoff careers, Rinne has won one series, Howard has won two, and both have GAA in the 2.6 range. Neither gives their team a clear edge. Rinne is a likely Vezina Trophy finalist. Howard might have been a finalist if not for a rash of injuries in the second half. Goaltending is important; it always is. But its not some massive key in this series. Both goalies are very good.

HP and Samsung's notebooks were spotlighted during Microsoft's big kickoff keynote. Clearly, both companies are still feeling their way around the concept. Is the HP Envy 14 Spectre even an ultrabook? It's about as heavy as a MacBook Pro and barely more than a tenth of an inch thinner. Its 14-inch screen fails to make the Spectre any more waiflike. The $1,499 sticker price is the cost of most midrange Windows notebooks . . . plus an iPad. It looks nice enough, but why bother? It's no wonder that the ultrabook category is already getting blurred into two classes: "ultrabooks" and "ultraportables."
My husband deserves the credit for coming up with the name. We had a long running discussion about how dangerous my spiky plant obsession would be when we finally adopted a pug, since they have such buggy eyes. When I mentioned starting a blog it took him about 3 minutes to come up with the name, it was perfect on so many levels. I garden on the edge of what is hardy here in Portland, which is emotionally dangerous (watching plants you love die a slow death isn't something I'd recommend). And, the money I can spend on plants, also a bit dangerous, financially.

BART's rail cars are unique and costly for a number of reasons, including their lightweight design, which requires aluminum shells instead of stainless steel; a power system using more voltage to provide faster acceleration; wider tracks, presumably to provide a smoother ride; and sturdier parts to handle BART's higher speeds and quicker acceleration.
“It was a really physical game,” said OSU guard Jared Cunningham, who finished with 14 points but scored just three in the second half. “We really didn’t have a lot of energy in the second half and that’s what killed us.

Curtis' erratic behavior becomes increasingly difficult to mask. Samantha is worried, obviously, and somewhat exasperated. So, too, is his friend and co-worker Dewart (Shea Whigham). Curtis' seemingly solid life becomes more and more threatened, and the maddening thing is that he's the one causing the damage.

It can be a game of diminishing returns. After haggling with an insurance company to cover a patient's prescription, the insurer may subsequently move the prescription to mail order.
I don't think fans need to hit the panic button by any means. If there are more departures it might raise a red flag, but Brown has a history of transferring (he went to three high schools in four years, leaving Findlay Prep in the middle of the season when he was a junior) and Barron wasn't playing much, so it's hard to get a read on him. The most interesting part of Altman's post game press conference last night was that he seemed very sad to me. For a no-nonsense guy like Altman, this was a little different demeanor.

Four of Steen-Andersen's pieces, which were meant to be performed without a break, boasted more formal shapeliness. The high point was "On and Off and to and Fro," a long and varied but still well-organized ensemble that involved clarinet, vibraphone and cello along with three electronic megaphones; a solo cadenza for siren sounds and feedback was just one tour de force among many.

This time on the advice of my GPS, I took Interstate 80 to Truckee, turned right onto Highway 28 and followed the Truckee River to a big left turn, where you finally see the achingly beautiful blue lake as you wind your way through small resort towns that lead to Crystal Bay. Here I'd booked a room at the legendary CalNeva Lodge (home to mob guys like Elmer "Bones" Remmer and "Wingy" Grober, plus Frank Sinatra, who owned the place briefly).
The season opens with the conman lark of a musical "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels." about grifters plying their shady trade. (Sept. 11 -30).
Avoiding that steep cut will be costly, mainly because there are so many people on Social Security — about 55 million today, approaching 90 million in 2033. The sooner Congress adjusts the program to bring more money into the trust fund, reduce the growth in benefit costs, or both, the less drastic the changes will have to be.
Businesses might use automation to draw more customers through better service, but improved services don't necessarily have an immediate payback in the public sector, he said.

With their flat terrain and tabula-rasa potential, the two parks, occupying the old site of the Rand Corp. headquarters just west of Santa Monica City Hall, offer little of the romantic, post-industrial drama of the sites where Field Operations has produced its most memorable designs. There is no rusting and useful relic like the abandoned elevated train tracks that form the spine of Corner's most celebrated work, the High Line park on the far west side of Manhattan. There is nothing like the complex history of the Fresh Kills waterfront park on New York's Staten Island, a former landfill that is nearly three times the size of Central Park and became a macabre sorting ground for World Trade Center rubble after the 9/11 attacks.
How, she wondered, could the trial of the woman charged with killing 2-year-old Caylee Anthony, totally eclipse the story of a man charged with raping, killing and burying 11 women on his property?

But "Big River" works, partly because its story is sunnier and, in this production, partly because stage artists conspire to use their talents to create transcendent moments. It's not the same thing as great literature. But it's not entirely different, either.
"It’s going to be a tough series. I think every time we play these guys -- every time we play within our division. We’ve got a lot of good baseball teams and there are going to be a lot of good, close games.”
Maybe they have to let the rest of the team see Weeden first? The size. The arm. Maybe that's all they're waiting for to say Weeden is going into camp as No. 1 quarterback. They came surprisingly close to anointing him on the night of the draft, sloughing off the question about a quarterback competition while failing to dismiss another about possibly trading Colt McCoy.
Reduced billing suggests UO's need for Bond, Schoeneck & King is waning, which could signal the final days of the law firm's investigation. And because the university is working in unison with the NCAA on this matter, which was illustrated within the documents entitled "Proposed Findings of Violations" released Feb. 24, the end might be near.
"He was educated, he was experienced, and after 20 years, he knew better," she remarked.

The stricken transfer law, said Center School District Superintendent Bob Bartman, “was designed to help people who want to transfer, but it does not address the problems of the overwhelming majority who would stay in a district.”
Bottom line: New Yorkers should step up to save mass transit. Mostly, we should be willing to foot the tab for any worker perks or pay hikes we won't actively oppose. (Public support for the transit union during its crippling, illegal 2005 Christmas strike suggests New Yorkers may be reluctant to speak out against labor concessions, even now. Fine -- so let them put their money where their mouths aren't.)

The Georgia Department of Transportation has been struggling to get public-private toll road projects off the ground since a state law established such a program in 2003. The agency is currently looking for a private investor to expand I-75 and I-575 in Cobb and Cherokee counties. That oft-delayed project was supposed to go out for bid in June but was just delayed again. The DOT is waiting to see if Georgia wins a federally subsidized loan for the project.
Republicans also offered an alternative bill built largely on private-sector initiatives, and argued its merits on the floor Saturday night. Preliminary CBO projections show that the Republican bill would lower premiums by as much as 10 percent.

This ordinance is a second coming for the issue. Back in April 2010, officials dealt with property damage caused by skateboarding near the municipal building housing City Hall and the library, but a proposal for an ordinance commanding a $100 citation didn’t pick up steam.

Depending on whom you ask, some 200 to 400 of Eureka Springs' 2,000 residents are working artists. To be sure, some of them are awful. We saw plenty of starving-artist landscapes and kitschy knick-knacks.

Together with the city's Southern architecture, New Orleans vibe and good restaurants, Eureka Springs made a perfect home base for our weekend arty Arkansas adventure.

Do you have any memories from past Opening Days? Actually, the past couple of years have been great Opening Days for me. My best friend and business partner Sean McShane's birthday always falls around Opening Day, so we use it as a way of celebrating.

We travel around the city going from bar to bar, sharing a couple of appetizers and hopefully a Michigan beer, searching for a place we have never been -- usually a really good dive bar.

She had no idea where the dresser came from. And so it’s funny, really, the way the dresser told her itself. The way it found a person dreaming of the kind of stability that it had once known, and pushed itself against her bedroom wall, so it would be the first thing and last thing she saw each day.

Yet "Private Empire" is not so much an indictment as a fascinating look into American business and politics. With each chapter as forceful as a New Yorker article, the book abounds in Dickensian characters. Chief among them is Raymond, known to subordinates as "Iron Ass."

The agency says there is enough evidence that Davis-Besse's owner, FirstEnergy Corp., is now committed to safety first -- an apparent faith in a company that, just eight years ago, was one of the least trusted reactor operators in the nation because of sloppy maintenance that allowed unprecedented corrosion of the reactor's lid.
As it turned out, the over-the-shoulder approach was more survival than strategy. With elite athlete recruiter John Tope trying to interpret, Adugna, who doesn't speak English, said he thought the pace was too slow, but laid back because of the wind.

“We want people to be aware of their surroundings. It’s the little things,” Raroha said. “We’re trying to make it a better place. If there’s trash blowing around, pick it up. If people see it but don’t care, it’s a downward spiral.”

6. Lee Westwood, England -- Even though it might not have been against the strongest field, Westwood's victory two weeks ago in the CIMB Indonesian Masters continued what is shaping up as another terrific season for the No. 3-ranked player in the world. He has finished in the top four on five occasions, including a tie for third in the Masters, and in the nine tournaments he has played around the world, he has been out of the top 25 only when he tied for 29th in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral. ... The Englishman is playing this week in the Wells Fargo Championship for the fourth time and has yet to perform at his best on the course at Quail Hollow. He shot 73-78--151 to miss the cut by five strokes in 2006, tied for 61st the following year and tied for 38th when he returned after a three-year absence in 2010. He has not broken 70 in any of his 10 rounds on the course in Charlotte. Because of his U.S. commitments, he did not defend his title in the Ballantine's Championship last week in South Korea. ... While Westwood wants a title in the Masters and the Green Jacket that goes with it more than anything, he has had more than his share of titles in some of those other Masters tournaments. His second consecutive title in the Indonesian Masters was his 11th victory, among his career total of 37, in which the tournaments has the word Masters in the title. He also has won the Volvo Scandinavian Masters twice, the Quinn Direct British Masters, the Portugal Masters, the Volvo Masters Andalucia, the Canon European Masters and the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters three times.
