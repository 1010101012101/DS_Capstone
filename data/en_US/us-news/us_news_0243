Mary Armstrong, an Arkansas native retired in Phoenix, said it pains her to mention racism because she is Black, but she is convinced that Hispanics face that problem. "I'd say it's still going on," Armstrong said. "I'm hoping we can come together."
A: The same things that got me interested as a kid: the local connections; the feeling of intimacy with announcers and stations you get to know; the musical surprises. There's less of this than ever before, and you have to search, sometimes, to find those connections and surprises, but they're there.
From the sound of it, Maryanski won't ever have her fill of the game.
"It's been a week of great emotion, confusion, uncertainty," student-body president T.J. Bard said earlier today. "Students right now are looking for normalcy. They're looking for the university to be moving forward to get back essentially to everyday life. It's going to be a long time before that happens."
The Volante, which was a great match with the dark raspberry caramel, is a delicious small production (only 390 cases) dessert wine. The term Late Harvest refers to sweet wines that were made from grapes that were left on the vine as late in the season as possible, allowing the sugar to become more concentrated. If you like fruity, in-your-face zinfandels, you might be interested in trying this sweet version. It is a rich, luscious wine with flavors of ripe plums and berries and hints of spice. It reminded me of ruby-style ports, but because it's not a fortified wine, it's not as heavy and is lower in alcohol at 15.8 percent. And like ruby ports, this wine would pair well with English Stilton and other blue cheeses.
If the suit succeds at limiting the take of Chicago-based Mepco Finance Corp., more money could go to other creditors - including hundreds of disgruntled customers who have filed claims and state attorneys general seeking restitution for tens of thousands more.

Hudson Landing, claimed for $50,000 two months ago by owner Jared Chappel, upset 1-to-2 favorite Jeranimo in the $150,000 San Francisco Mile at Golden Gate Fields on Saturday.
But much has changed on the immigration front since then: The state's sizable illegal-immigrant population, one of the driving factors behind passage of the law, has shrunk dramatically. The state hasn't passed a single immigration bill since SB 1070, ending the passage of a string of enforcement measures leading up to the law. And the state's large but politically anemic Latino population is showing signs of gaining political muscle.
Philbin collapses at the sight of Erik's skull-like face — a sight scarier than a hundred Freddy Kruegers. Erik can be tender, but at this moment, he pulls Christine by the hair and taunts: "Feast your eyes, glut your soul, on my accursed ugliness!"

Chelsey was more distracted by the parsnip and pear puree oddly studded with paper-thin pieces of dried pear. She insisted it tasted like dessert rather than an entrée, although I thought it worked.
Mowry is also working with the County Council to meet the demands of a new procurement ordinance, which mandates that all purchases and contracts be online. Businesses must be able to find contracts to bid on. And citizens must be able to find pending and finalized deals, in an easily searchable format. That's complicated, Mowry said, showing pages of color-coded flow charts.
“I never imagined I would be like this,” Umenyiora said. “This is unbelievable.”

Diners can now get a really good pizza at both lunch and dinner, and the oven is also used to make house-baked bread and some main courses. My favorite time is morning, where you can get an Americano or espresso, excellent pastries and a delicious breakfast quiche ($6) or eggs baked in the wood oven ($11) with heirloom potatoes, house-made sausage patties and thick slices of rustic bread.
Winston Churchill, in England's darkest hour, turned down the opportunity to become the dictator of Britain. Like Mr. Churchill, our president should remind his nation and himself that our Constitution names fundamental rights that are to be upheld in times of peace and war.
Gingrich's early-December rise in several polls gave him renewed hopes of carrying his campaign deep into the primary season. Failure to compete in Virginia, which is among the "Super Tuesday" primaries, would deal a huge blow to any contender who had not locked up the nomination by then.

That a film as delicate, personal and small-scaled as “Salt of Life,” directed and co-written by Italy’s Gianni Di Gregorio, exists at all is a function of fate and chance. Di Gregorio, who also stars, acted as a young man before beginning what became an accomplished screenwriting career.
Middlebury College at Alexandria, where one of the Washington University students is studying, decided today to make arrangements to bring students back to the United States, Beirn said.
President Obama's motorcade arrived at Shaker Heights High School at 12:50 pm.
And unlike some others in his world, he apparently never amassed great personal wealth from his work. He took an annual salary of $113,000 from his prison groups and donated all royalties from his 30 books, substantial speaking fees, and the $1 million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion he was awarded in London in 1993 to his prison fellowship.

Notes: Collen Warner of the University of Portland was selected No. 15 by Real Salt Lake. ... The Union maneuvered in the draft and ended up with the Nos. 6 and 7 picks, selecting two other teen-agers: 18-year-old defender Amobi Okugo and 17-year-old Jack McInerney. ... Two Oregonians have been No. 1 picks in the NFL draft, and one went first overall in the major league draft. George Shaw, out of Oregon and Grant High School, was made the top pick in the 1955 draft by the Baltimore Colts. In 1963, the Los Angeles Rams chose Terry Baker (Oregon State and Jefferson High School) with the No. 1 pick.

“I was surprised when I turned and no one came to me,” Ovechkin said. “I had a perfect lane for the shot, and I see it and I’m going to the net.”
Nostalgia is, after all, one of the most powerful tools in the pop-culture closet. The Rolling Stones could wheeze their way through "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" till they're 90, and some fans would lap it up, cheering as if they were hearing it for the first time.
Worse, the system was dreadful at understanding street addresses. I don't have a thick accent, but it still took me nearly the entire 10-minute ride home from my son's school to get the system to recognize where I wanted to go. It not only misidentified the street name, but also thought I was saying "Anaheim" when I said "San Jose."

It would be barely understandable if his fear about losing receptacles for his dog's daily poop was grounded in fact or reality. But he clearly did not bother to read the ordinance or look at its very real benefits. If he had, he would realize that certain plastic bags (like those the U-T is home-delivered in) are not banned. And the paper bags that he erroneously believes are not addressed by the ordinance, are discouraged with appropriate disincentives.
Tired of being a lifeguard and with little interest in filling out college applications, Downham joined the United States Coast Guard at the end of the summer of 2001. He spent the next few years as a boatswain’s mate on a cutter in Hawaii, carrying a gun and inspecting fishing vessels. Two months before his enlistment was up, he rescinded his discharge papers after realizing he’d never followed through on what he originally joined the Coast Guard to do — save lives.

"Carlos has a way of harnessing our attention and holding it, almost like the reins of a giant carriage," says Nancy Ives, principal cello. "When there's a distraction, anything from a mistake in the orchestra to a cell phone in the audience, he leaves it behind so completely that we are kept in the moment along with him. He compels us to stay with him through sheer force of will. I think this skill relates to another of his greatest strengths: his virtuosic command of the structure of the music. You can feel the architecture of the whole being shaped in every moment."
“If you need somebody to do your laundry, they can do that,” the resident said.
An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge has dealt a serious blow to the county's use of binding arbitration to solve collective bargaining disputes with employees, ruling that the entire system is unconstitutional.
Christie’s plan comes two years after NJN officials proposed the transfer of the network’s state license to the NJN Foundation. Addressing a legislative committee in April 2008, then-NJN chief executive Elizabeth Christopherson said the move would free NJN from burdensome government regulations, such as competitive bidding for equipment purchases and restrictions on hiring personnel. At the time, the state Public Broadcasting Authority, which operates NJN, said it had no plans to lay off workers.

Former National Security Agency official Thomas Drake was indicted in 2010 under the act for retaining classified information about a troubled surveillance program for the purposes of leaking it to The Baltimore Sun.
Ayoade comes out of music videos, and that contributes to a weakness in the storytelling. There are two sequences built around songs that really feel like padding; he also has a tendency to bring up ideas and then not develop them.

"The receivers still have got to catch the ball. They will be better," promises Mike Holmgren. "That's why no one's in a panic about how the draft went as far as our receivers.

In early returns, Pombo, a seven-term congressman from Tracy, was neck-and-neck with Democratic challenger Jerry McNerney, a wind-energy consultant who has never won elective office. With 44 percent of precincts reporting, Pombo trailed 48 percent to McNerney's 52 percent -- one of several reversals from early returns, but too close to call.
It's a "Jive Relay" -- Cheryl's team is up first. They could use some work on their synchronization. Tony's team is better synchronized, but doesn't have quite the same flair for tricks that Cheryl's did. Louis' team is up last and they look the closest to the pros to me, in terms of polish. If they don't win this, the fix is in. Tom has to jump in and remind the judges this is a live show and try to hurry them along. In the process, he swears -- so un-Tom-like. And they put Louis' team in 3rd place -- I think I need to have my audio dropped out. Cheryl's team wins.

He had a five-inning no-decision.
"A Separation" reaches American screens—and joins the Oscar race as Iran's official entry—at a time of escalating tension between the two nations. What's more, one of Iran's most prominent—and provocative—filmmakers, Jafar Panahi, is currently in prison after the Iranian government sentenced him to six years of incarceration and a 20-year ban on any activities connected with making movies. Why, then, did the authorities put their stamp of approval on Mr. Farhadi's film? He was asked that question at last summer's Telluride Film Festival. "Censorship in a country like mine," he replied, "is a little bit like autumn weather. There may be rain in the morning, then sun later. I can only guess that my film came before the censors when the sun was shining. It may also have helped that I haven't judged anyone in it."
Aldridge visited Dr. Marc Philippon in Vail, Colo., on Tuesday in search of a third medical opinion, and the outcome was not good. Blazers interim general manager Chad Buchanan said a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed an "abnormality" in Aldridge's hip, and he did not play against the Warriors. Officially, the team has labeled Aldridge's status as day-to-day, but it seems more and more possible he played his last game of the season Monday night during the Blazers' loss to the Houston Rockets.
On the other hand, pre-emption doesn't look great, either. The Iranian regime, while dangerous, does not have suicidal tendencies. And the consequences of any airstrike against Iran's enrichment facilities at Qom and Natanz would probably not be limited to direct counterattacks by Iranian agents and proxies against U.S. or Israeli forces in the region: International economic sanctions and arms bans against Iran are likely to be weakened and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors ejected from the Islamic republic. And for what? A one- to three-year delay, not destruction, of the Iranian bomb program -- as well as greater consensus within Iran to pursue the nuclear option.

Peter Marks, senior director of food at wine at Copia (the American Center for Wine, Food & the Arts), sees people's diverging opinions on a regular basis.

Alan McClure of Patric Chocolate in Columbia has been crafting chocolate bars for a couple of years, using single-origin batches of cocoa beans he carefully roasts himself. But the $7 gourmet chocolate bar market is a slim one. Hoping to flesh out his product line yet stay true to his chocolate-making values, McClure approached artisanal chocolatier Christopher Elbow about co-branding a bonbon. Elbow, who frequently collaborates with local food entrepreneurs, was game. Recently, the two chocolatiers met at Elbow�s shop at 1819 McGee St. to test the marriage of Patric ganache with Elbow�s enrobing chocolate. �I wanted to merge something unique that is not just Patric or Elbow, but is something new and exciting.

The back story: For months, Cait had been clipping every photo she could find of the squished-face dogs. Every time she'd showed me another picture, I'd smile and say, "Not yet, honey." We were a one-parent, one-income family, and pugs aren't cheap.
"He's been around basketball his whole life, played for so many coaches, been able to steal from everybody and has developed a vast knowledge that will certainly play a huge role in his success as a head coach," Self said. "He will lead Tulsa to great heights athletically and be competing for championships in a very short amount of time."
Aside from being around the dogs, part of the excitement is finding a new dog that's not been campaigned all over the country. The bitch (a female Kerry blue terrier) that I gave my (best of) group to at the Garden I had never had my hands on before. She was a great dog.
Greece's flagrant flouting of EU debt and deficit limits has triggered drop in the euro's value against the dollar and exposed the flaws in the loose way eurozone governments are supposed to coordinate their economies.

"As a team, we want to win the sectional again. If we want to finish in the top three at state, we had better be able to do that. Individually, I'd like to get my time below 14:40 before the state meet comes around."
I was mesmerized by the possibilities of such a trip. If you had all the time in the world, where would you go? What would you see? What lifelong dreams would you turn into reality? But in today's hectic and uncertain world, could you really just give it all up and hit the road? Certainly, it's not a practical option for most. But I couldn't get the globe-trotting daydreams out of my head, and, within days, a plan had begun to take shape.
People started commenting on his ragged footwear. I didn't care. As long as there was one thread holding those shoes on his feet, I was sticking to my guns.

"That's easily attributed to citizens who say, 'We call police when things are going on whereas before we didn't because there was no action taken,'" Fitch said. "They've become very comfortable with getting us involved in what's going on in the community and that's directly related to the crime drop because the community got involved in crime issues."
Example: Romneys new economic plan relies heavily on the assumption that big tax cuts will jump-start the economy  and thus boost tax revenue and thereby erase the nations debt and deficit woes. That sounds an awful lot like what didnt work very well for President George W. Bush.
Role model: "My mom is most definitely my role model. She was the one that taught me to never give up, no matter what. I learned everything there is to know from her, such as how to be a good person.

"I watched my mom take care of her mom and I decided to be the caregiver for my mom," she said.

In the mid-1980s, Lee said, the disabled in South Korea were often viewed as embarrassing curiosities — more creature than child. Even today, he said, babies with physical deformities are seen as a national shame in a culture that prizes physical perfection, where cosmetic surgeries have become as common as haircuts.
These transitions, in some cases wrenching, were made easier by his talent. His home was the stage and his work, so he didn't feel the general's sense of dislocation. At the same time, he well remembers meeting exiled Russians in London and Paris in the early '70s. They'd introduce themselves backstage as Count So-and-So, but they might be a farmer or work in a restaurant or drive a cab. All of those people informed the general, as did Baryshnikov's father, who was a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army.

After his win in South Carolina, a Gingrich nomination briefly seemed plausible. But that possibility was quickly extinguished to everybody but Gingrich. As recently as two weeks ago, Gingrich was vowing to remain a candidate until the Republican National Convention.

The man had tears streaming down his face as he approached McDonough and explained he was a doctor in Lancaster, Pa., and was driving along I-95 when he saw the flags. The sight inspired the man to stop and personally thank those involved because his brother was the pilot of the plane that was hijacked on 9/11 and flown into the Pentagon, McDonough said.
"It is not in my interest to shed light on details that could lead to arrests," he said refusing to comment on the group's alleged other members.
Another Lodi theme is the sheer unpretentiousness of the whole experience. The downtown has a cozy, small-town American vibe right out of the 1950s Midwest, and its citizens are so unpretentious that even when they try to be pretentious it comes off as unpretentious. Take Joe and Kay Berghold, who make forceful, traditionally structured wines. With the help of their winemaker son, Miles, they built a cavernous tasting room specifically to house their vast collection of Victorian antiques. But when you belly up to their main tasting bar, next to the Dolly Parton look-alikes and the big men in new Stetsons, tight Wranglers and their best cowboy boots, slurping Syrah, it's hard to match the feelings of inadequacy you get at fancy Napa wineries.
A day later, Katz wanted to know what was happening with the contract talks. As the evening of Valentine’s Day progressed, she still hadn’t gotten the answers she sought, and that sharpened her edge.
Perhaps even aristocratic, in being restrained while still giving full expression to the repertoire's many emotional conventions  big pathos, whispered pathos, sunny optimism, hushed respect, the works.

Holmgren: "That is something that you have to work to not have happen. Again, I think knowing the personalities, if ever I've seen that happen, it's usually because it's created by the two principals. If I am any judge at all about these young guys, that won't be the reason. It shouldn't be a reason. You aren't going to have half for one guy and half for another guy or half for Seneca (Wallace) or half for whoever. It shouldn't happen. It usually happens if the players themselves kind of lead the charge on that and that is not going to happen."

But still it was Cockroft's foot that won this one.
Buckwheat fettuccine with fontina from Val d'Aosta and oyster mushrooms, though, is too bland. And I'd have to say that pizza is not the kitchen's strong suit either. They're fine, just not that compelling. Maybe it's the crust, which doesn't have much flavor, considering it's baked in a wood-burning oven. Toppings are oddball too. Smoked mozzarella would have been better on its own than paired with a tomato sauce, for example.
As a result, the financing company is entitled to seize about $5.5 million worth of inventory at 18 of the chain’s retail and storage locations, most of them in New Jersey.

Allergens cause a contact allergy when they touch the skin, and this reaction is almost always delayed. Immediate reactions can occur such as to latex, but skin takes several days after contact before a rash develops in response to most allergens.

There were also dire signals that extremists will do what they can to derail the effort.
“It really gets into a whole restarting mentality,” coach Bill Belichick said today at his morning press conference. “It’s not like taking a break and coming out in the second half. It’s like starting the game all over again. It’s like playing a game, stopping, and then playing a second game. It’s like a double-header in baseball, if you will.”

A great example is an antojito - starter - of three small tostadas ($10.50) topped with black bean puree, roasted cauliflower, raisins and pine nuts.

When we started Tazo, we were creating flavors that we bet others out there would like. But when you're putting product in so many thousands of Starbucks stores, you can't afford to fail ...

Wow. And I'm an accessory to that crime. I've always loved music, but I never learned to understand those printed notes and numbers. I didn't need to. Generations ago, if somebody wanted to know what a melody sounded like, they'd buy the sheet music and play the song on an instrument. In my case, it meant turning on a machine: I could simply hear the tune on a radio or record player, and later, cassettes and CDs. Today's kids don't even do that, because their music is digitally downloaded. Is the printed page headed for a similar fate?

For Sparky, there simply was no risk too steep for remaining true to the lifelong baseball principles he had held sacred since he was a boy. "If you don't stand up for everything you believe in, you got no place to stand," he eloquently told me when he made the decision final. "If principle has a price tag, then it ain't worth nothin' in the first place."
Cyclists agree, Edwardsville leads the way in bike-ability. Expansions to Illinois State routes 157 and 159 widened shoulders make it easier for cyclists to use main roads, Parks said.

The details: You're about to witness the unheard-of - I am recommending a stemless glass. While on balance I can't stand the concept, there are moments to reconsider ... and trying to drink a decent bottle of fizz with a jelly jar or Dixie cup is a waste of good bubbles. So Govino has extended its glassware line, intended for picnics and other glass-unfriendly situations, to the fizzy realm. These BPA-free stemless flutes ($13/four-pack) actually provide a solid container for sparkling wine (or shots of Tequila, later in the evening ) and frame the wine perfectly.

Trains would rumble by on the tracks just across the street, kicking up dust and shaking the house. It was something the family just learned to sleep through. The nearby railway station meant it was easy to get their crops -- sometimes cotton, more often peanuts -- off to market.
It’s unlikely Sutter will change the lineup for Thursday's game, given that the Kings have a 2-0 series lead and given the strong performance so far of fourth-liners Brad Richardson, Colin Fraser and Jordan Nolan. Clifford could conceivably replace Dwight King on the third line but Sutter had heaps of praise Thursday morning for rookies King and Nolan and the positive effect the two forwards have had since they were recalled from Manchester, N.H., of the American Hockey League on Feb. 10.

There's another convenience with the iPad: You can create jump-points for repeats. For example, at the end of the third movement of the Brahms Piano Quintet, there's a repeat where you have to jump back 20 pages. Instead of frantically flipping back through the pages of a print edition, I have established the jump-point. Very convenient.

"Honestly I don't know," said Hickson when asked if the position switch is the problem. "It's more mental than anything being in a new system, two new coaches in less than two months, new style of play, new personnel on the court. New front office, new way of doing things. Everything is a blur to me."
New York Knicks star Amare Stoudemire scored 20 points in an NBA playoff win Sunday, but the bandage on his left hand reminded fans that he'd recently made headlines in quite a different way: smashing the glass of a fire extinguisher case after losing in Miami six days earlier.
Protesters and union organizers shut down ferry service at the Larkspur and Sausalito terminals during the morning commute, marched to the Fruitvale BART station in East Oakland made famous by the police shooting death of Oscar Grant III, and in San Francisco swarmed a bank, and retook a vacant building owned by the Catholic Archdiocese on Turk Street.

"A lot of people try to skirt the system," Gregos says. "I see it all the time." Some will claim that their pet dogs are service dogs that help them with disabilities they don't really have — and they can get away with that, because the law doesn't require people to present proof of their own disability or their dog's capacity to deal with it. (It doesn't help that service dog vests are readily available online.) Proprietors may deny entrance to dogs that arouse their skepticism, and that's fine if they're right. If they're wrong, it can lead to a fine of a very different kind.

The crash seriously injured Robert Felix a 41-year-old Monmouth County corrections officer from Keansburg, according to court proceedings.

Three months ago, the Taliban announced readiness to open an office in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar to try to reach an understanding with the United States.

"I would be thankful if people, whether they were having a bad day or not, would treat service people -- cashiers, policemen, waitresses, garbage women, etc. -- better. My Nana taught me that you treat people the way you want to be treated. That was more than 50 years ago, and it has served me very well. Thank you to all that take care of me on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis."
Delaying the project hurt U.S. energy security and cost "the ability to create over 20,000 construction and manufacturing jobs," he said. Obama's decision to not issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline meant "we were denied the ability immediately to reduce prices at the pump."
You can easily pass by Russo's Kitchen in Peninsula, situated as it is on a mildly depressing stretch of Ohio 8 in front of a motel and flanked by garden nurseries and dog kennels. But take whatever time you need to find this place -- then devote a few hours to savoring the vittles. You'll be glad you did. The regular menu is a generous though slightly bewildering melange of southern Louisiana, southern Italy and just plain Southern; the list of nightly specials can be staggering. Somehow the kitchen, an open staging area for exhibition cooking behind the sleek, modern bar, manages to execute the different cuisines deftly. Feeling the love for Cajun? Try the gumbo yaya, the jambalaya or the chicken etouffee. In the mood to mambo Italiano? There's arancini, calamari and cavatelli. Order a heaping side of fried green tomatoes or the best collard greens this side of the Mason-Dixon Line (OK, the Italian seasonings do make the dish a hybrid) to share. Wash it all down with one of the local craft beers or try a specialty martini. Just don't count on having meaningful conversation. The place attracts a loyal following and skews young, hip and noisy. Overall, though, the experience is top-drawer.

Taylor's report reveals that while the number of vehicle registration transactions has remained more or less static in recent years, something less than 30 million per year, ever-fewer of them are done by mail or in-person visits and ever-more via the Internet and other alternative methods.
Fast forward to November of 2010, thirty four years since that 300 game. I’m sitting at my computer, checking out an internet site called Classmates.com. I was told by my brother Dennis that there was a message from Rick Phillips on that site. Sure enough, under the message banner was an entry dated June 5, 2008, at 9:25 a.m. PST. “Looking for Dennis, Steve, Dave, Kevin, and Mary Jo. Dave was in my wedding in 1977”. This was neat. I was on the site to track down some old friends as well. I’d finally be able to thank him for what he did for me back during my 300 game in 1976. I thought he would get a kick out of that, and put a smile on his face! With Rick looking for us, we shouldn’t have any problem tracking the guy down. His mom, Madge, has to still be in Fullerton. My brother Dave would probably know how to contact him. The only problem was, as was confirmed about a week later, Rick had passed away about two and a half years ago, just 5 months after posting the message!

It's an inferior category of protection; hunting, for example, is permitted. But a happy irony of Mojave's lesser designation is that the preserve, unlike its A-list siblings, barely registers on tourists' radar. Even seasoned Southwest travelers may not realize what they're missing: 1.5 million acres of solitude draped across vast forests of Joshua trees, snow-dusted peaks and measureless desert horizons. If the national park was America's best idea, the national preserve — and this one in particular — may be our best-kept secret.

Still, it may not be entirely awful that so many elders are in charge of the Oscars. Given that 30-year-old directors targeting the tastes of 14-year-old boys make a disturbingly high proportion of Hollywood movies, perhaps it’s lucky that grown-ups are in charge when prizes are handed out.

But the hourly wage of a school bus driver in the 25th percentile – in other words, the most recently hired drivers – was $14.57, vs. $14.47 for a transit agency bus driver.

THOMAS: No, being married to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident does not automatically grant anyone status or permission to remain in the U.S. Arizona law does not provide any exceptions in their transporting statute for spouses or other family members. If they were married, they potentially may argue that the statute violates freedom of association under the First Amendment for preventing the family from associating with their family member.

Having a U.S. citizen spouse, parent or child, coupled with other necessary factors, may provide a defense in immigration removal proceedings.

There are days here, in these war-haunted times, when it seems that death might come in any guise, and from any direction. From a bomb buried in the earth. From the sky. From a rusted motorbike haphazardly parked in a busy marketplace, with no one paying it and its deadly package any notice.
Don't worry, I'll keep my own juvenile puns to myself. In fact, Forsberg and chef Nathan Beauchamp actually take their balls very seriously. (Sorry.)
Under the proposed legislation, being off-duty would not be an issue.

No, I felt this was another Florence Knoll-type of opportunity, which you normally don't get. You know, after Pratt and a brief time in the Army, I went and worked with George Nelson, Charles Eames, Florence Knoll and Saarinen -- that was my school after school.

In designing your centerpiece, start with lace or embroidered linens from your grandma's attic, local craft store or resale shop. Center the linen on each table.

"If they see one side not willing to work with the other to move the country forward, then that's what elections are all about," Obama said in an interview with talk radio host Tom Joyner this week. "So we're going to be in a struggle for probably the next 16, 17 months."

Moving to a one-patient, one-chart system makes UH more prepared for health care reform, the biggest challenge facing the industry.

House Republican leaders blocked Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a foe of illegal immigration with a penchant for harsh rhetoric, from taking over the immigration subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee -- signaling that they are sensitive to the political pitfalls of alienating Latinos.

Kasich is embroiled in a tough-as-nails contest against Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. A swing state that voted for President Obama in 2008, Ohio is viewed as the future of both political parties.The next governor is going to play a major role in the 2012 elections because a state's chief executive controls massive political and volunteer operations as well as other mechanisms inside the election process. Christie's visit today comes as Ohioans begin early voting for the Nov. 2 election and as the polls have started to narrow the lead Kasich has been holding over Strickland.

For Poggio, however, part of the reason for his book hunting did involve money. His years of maneuvering as a secular member in the Roman Curia amounted to nothing. He rose to become apostolic secretary to the wily, corrupt Pope John XXIII, who was deposed in 1415 (his name was erased from the books until Giuseppe Roncalli, the architect of Vatican II, claimed it for himself in 1958).
After Kobe Bryant and Andrew Bynum failed to switch on a pick-and-roll, Clippers guard Caron Butler connected with Griffin on a bounce pass. As Gasol helped out from the weakside, Griffin posterized him. After falling to the ground, Gasol immediately stood up and protested the non-call to officials.

As the draft ground on, surely a wide receiver would soon be identified and selected. After all, the "coach 'em up" plan had misfired last season as badly as a Ryan Pontbriand snap.

But residents of Guyrong — whose name translates as "three dragons rising to the sky" — say they have worked hard to build a community.

The third-warmest winter since 1945 hasn't had as big an effect on steelhead fishing as many anglers had hoped.

The season will conclude with Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s “Into the Woods” (May 3 to June 2, 2013). Even those who see the 1987 hit in Central Park this summer may be enticed to catch it again in Princeton.
