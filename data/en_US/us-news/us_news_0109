Salads almost vibrate with flavor, the greens are so fresh and the dressings so poised on the edge of tart. You could start with fat asparagus roasted in the wood-burning oven in a composition of creamy white burrata, emerald mache leaves and a scattering of hazelnuts. Endive and watercress sparkle in a salad with tangerine segments, sweet Medjool dates and pistachios. For a green salad, butter lettuce in a Meyer lemon and tarragon cream adorned with sugar snap peas and a few stalks of asparagus makes a vivid entrance.

I called Hospice of the East Bay and for the last two days of his life, they helped him to be more comfortable.

Hospice is a wonderful option and I am so glad that they were available to us.

I'll sneak away on my bike whenever possible, studying the azalea bushes and osprey nests in an effort to remember every detail.

That number should be of great concern to Dallas-based AT&T, because like most big phone companies, it is struggling with a slowdown in new subscribers. Nearly all adults - and many kids - in the U.S. already have cellphones. AT&T's executives have been touting smartphones as the solution, since the devices require consumers to pay for data use in addition to voice calls. Smartphone subscribers, therefore, pay more. So moving customers from regular phones to smartphones will keep boosting revenue, AT&T has said.

A number of years earlier, my birthday present had been a trip to the Highlands with my brother. It was my first and soon-to-be-last visit there, and I had dreamed of riding their huge wooden monster of a coaster. I was 9 or 10 years old, but felt pretty grown-up to be there without my parents. That sensation lasted only a few minutes, because when we entered the line for the Comet, the park attendants told me I was too small to ride it. What?! I hadn't been prepared for that letdown. I was devastated, and then things got worse.

"The way I did it when I first started — I didn't even own a typewriter. I would have graph paper, which had these little boxes you could write in. Because you have to count the characters.

If youve ever been seduced by the sweetly intoxicating smell of fresh basil in the produce section of your local Hen House, then youre familiar with at least one of Cal-Ann Farms hydroponically grown products. In addition to Osmin, Amethyst, Thai and lemon basil, this spring fourth-generation farmers Pam and Jeff Meyer of Basehor began test-marketing hydroponically grown baby dill and watercress plants  with the roots attached, for a home feel. For many farmers, the marketing end of the business doesnt come naturally. But the Meyers and their daughter, Michelle McGown, know its important to get new products out in front of their customers. For immediate feedback, theyve set up a blog at calannfarms.wordpress.com so customers can leave comments.

mutual feeling that a trade would be best for the righthander, who was the 30th overall pick in the 2006 draft. If/when Ottavino is dealt, he would be the fifth first-round pick for the Cardinals since 2003 who was moved via trade. Four of them didn't make a dent in the majors before being dealt. Now, the value of a prospect can be measured in what he brought in return. By that gauge, Brett Wallace, the 13th overall pick in 2008, was a successful selection for the Cardinals because he was the linchpin of the deal that brought Matt Holliday from Oakland. The trade that sent Colby Rasmus (28th overall in 2005) to Toronto has not had the short-term boost expected, but it's true evaluation won't be clear until this winter at the earliest, when the Cardinals make a call on their center fielder for 2012 and decide where lefty Marc Rzepczynski fits on the pitching staff.

Other cuts are far more problematic, among them limiting Medicaid patients to five drug prescriptions a month and reducing cancer and HIV/AIDS treatment. Cutting reimbursement rates for providers is not wise; given that the state already owes them $1.9 billion, some providers would quit the program.

Instead, Tuesday's hearing was similar to a progress report Adams and Sullivan gave in January to the Missouri Board of Eduction, where they placed even greater emphasis on how close the district is to qualifying for reaccreditation.

St. Louis schools have six points, but are lacking one point in the academic area.

Least favorite flight: JetBlue Long Beach to Seattle. A reminder that when it comes to arguments with airlines, they hold nearly all the cards. I was already in Seattle and planned to bring my family up for Valentine's Day. With winter storms disrupting flights throughout the U.S., JetBlue canceled my family's flight from Long Beach to Seattle, neither of which was affected by weather. It's possible that this was part of a domino effect, but the reason for the cancellation kept shifting: mechanical problems, weather issues back east, crew problems. JetBlue paid me back for the half of each ticket we didn't use. But with JetBlue flights full for at least two days, my only option was to buy one-way tickets to Seattle from John Wayne Airport. JetBlue didn't offer to repay me for those tickets or for the larger family-size hotel room I booked that I ended up spending the night in solo.

But that stuff, I think, is small beer when viewed next to some of the more ominous parallels: the rigged elections, the punitive use of the legal system to attack dissent and the increasing strength and prominence of the security services. I found myself nodding in agreement when you wrote, "The airwaves have indeed turned neo-Soviet, as Putinites across Russia -- often acting on their own -- have shuttered the arena of free speech and public debate."
These are the sort of wines that I return to when I've tasted one too many bottles that are blase or beaten into genericism. Even bad Chablis - there's still plenty of bad Chablis, from overworked vines - shows itself true to type. But great Chablis immediately comes to life. As we stroll into the height of spring, these wines share all the freshness and vitality that we want in our market baskets and on the table.

One of my favorite activities this primary season is to read the seemingly endless analyses of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

The grace of God is compared to "dew." In its original context, "dew" is a divine influence or covering. It is the gentle moistening of the earth that covers and refreshes vegetation.

R.C. served as the editorial watchdog for his paper. He perused all the editorials and was in constant contact with his writers. If an editorial did not suit, or if it violated his conception of freedom philosophy, he was sure to let them know. A particularly outstanding editorial was likely to be sent to all the papers. Editors were to make minor changes in the editorials to suit local circumstances and then publish the revision. And since freedom philosophy was a constantly evolving group of ideas there was constant correspondence and discussion among all the editors as to what should be the Freedom Newspaper position.
In the wake of the Devils' 4-0 win over the Florida Panthers, columnist Steve Politi notes that it was not a coincidence that it was Zach Parise who led the team to the win.

Producer/writer Whedon's first wrinkle is a neat one. In the prologue, we see that the college kids involved do not conform to genre stereotypes.

Also given added dimension are the requisite person of color (Jesse Williams) and the designated "virgin" (Kristen Connolly).

As a first-time candidate for Congress I do a lot of listening these days and, as a result, a lot of learning. Whether visiting at kitchen tables and coffee shops or businesses throughout Missouri's 2nd District, I am hearing from a lot of women and they are genuinely and sincerely worried about the future of our great nation.

Other countries, notably China, emulated our past open-market success. They adapted to the new world and we didn't. "We relaxed, underinvested and lived in the moment just when we needed to study harder, save more, rebuild our infrastructure" and attract more, not fewer, skilled immigrants. As Friedman and Mandelbaum write: "The failure to understand that we were living in a new world, and to adapt to it was a colossal and costly American mistake."

Because most native-plant nurseries, including Out Back Nursery in Hastings, Minnesota Native Landscapes in Otsego and Dragonfly in Amery, Wis., are located on the outskirts of the metro area, a visit requires more time than some homeowners are willing or able to spend, said Karen Eckman of Shoreview, native-plant advocate and educator.

Science fiction and fantasy writers are avid bloggers. They're tech-friendly early adapters who know how to articulate ideas, useful traits for a blogger. Lake started blogging in the late 1990s and went daily about 10 years ago, posting about the usual stuff: writing, politics, his daughter's school activities, what's going on in his life, where he'll be speaking. He does an aggregation post of articles that interest him every morning and posts a photo every day (photography is his other creative outlet). Kowal calls Lake a classic external processor, writing about whatever's on his mind, and it was no surprise to her or anyone else that when he was diagnosed with cancer that he would share the news. The surprise was that he had cancer in the first place.

Richard Bangs, the acclaimed and popular host of PBS's Emmy-Award winning "Adventures with Purpose" series, has teamed up with his friend and co-founder of Costa Rica Expeditions, Michael Kaye, to create a year-long program of "Quest for Pura Vida" expeditions patterned on the path Bangs filmed in his one-hour TV documentary now airing on PBS. The nine-day tours follow roughly the same route traveled by Bangs, one of the pioneers of adventure travel, as he navigated his personal quest to unravel the knotty strands of pura vida, or pure life, that led recent studies to proclaim Costa Rica "the happiest country on earth." Inspired by what he found for PBS, the "Quest for Pura Vida" expeditions beckon exploration-minded travelers to make their own discoveries as they blaze a trail similar to his.

Some will have the light, tart and focused character you're expecting.

What we have here is basically an American "Transporter," with Statham caught up in the most jaw-dropping, quick-cut fights you've seen in years. He plows through Russians on the subway, Chinese gangsters in a casino and cops in between, on the mean streets, which he navigates with dazzling automotive dexterity. Occasionally he stops long enough to make a threat. The dialogue and the characters are better than the plot. And the fights are better than even the one-liners. Statham never phones it in, though his roles can seem to be one long version of the same guy: haunted and hunted, in need of a shave. -ROGER MOORE, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE

Unfortunately, such wakefulness is not something that occurs once and then is outgrown forever, but is a stage that can appear at several different ages and for different reasons: in infancy, in toddlerhood, and quite possibly at regular intervals after that. Some children, for no reason that anyone has been able to determine, always sleep well; others appear to be born requiring little sleep. All parents seem to need sleep, however, so stubborn wakefulness on the child's part can be troubling indeed.

The department says the couriers' misuse of "delivery exception codes" blocked the government from seeking its money back on late-delivered packages. The Justice Department says the couriers used the codes even after tighter security was scaled back or became routine procedure for entering government buildings.

Emanuel Steward, the veteran trainer who just for this fight has taken over the resurrection of Miguel Cotto, says that he sees this evening as a kind of reincarnation of Jack Dempsey vs. Gene Tunney.

In its last two games, Iowa should have lost at Indiana and did lose at Northwestern. How can a team like that be picked to beat any team with the talent of the Buckeyes? Stanzi hasn't been as good lately, and the Iowa back seven on defense is there for the taking. As good as the Iowa defensive line is, the Buckeyes obviously are pretty good on defense, too, and they should make it just as tough on the Hawkeyes to get the run game going.
New fodder is not in short supply. On Wednesday, the council was infuriated by GQ magazine, which published sexualized photos of "Glee" cast members in its November issue. The actresses, unlike Cyrus, are adults, but noting that "Glee" is a show about high school, the council issued a statement saying the display "borders on pedophilia." To what end, though?

Since PolitiFact New Jersey debuted in mid-June, we have fact-checked Christie more times than any other person or organization. So while we wait for the next round of speculation (Christie in 2016?), we thought we’d sum up how the governor has — and has not — gotten his facts straight.
The trend is mirrored statewide. Maryland and city school officials said there has been more awareness of anti-bullying efforts since the establishment of the state's Safe Schools Reporting Act of 2005. The law requires school districts to report incidents of bullying and established a formal complaint form for victims of harassment and intimidation. Since then, new legislation has strengthened the law.

Choosing "Edge of Glory" by Lady Gaga was a poor choice, a power ballad with no discernible payoff. Most notably, Jermaine Paul worked the song and the crowd, Lindsey Pavao went back to being ill-at-ease again and Chris Mann looked just as happy singing Gaga as he does opera. Only we're left feeling uncomfortable.

Dominguez and others hope the square will lead to the naming of an El Salvador Community Corridor along Vermont from 11th Street to Adams Boulevard, home to many Salvadoran-owned businesses.

Comparing photos of just one person is a much easier task—the accuracy rates are high, and have been growing. In tests last year by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a U.S. government agency, facial-recognition software incorrectly said that two photos of the same person weren't a match less than 1% of the time. In similar tests in 1993, when facial-recognition technology was still nascent, the software was unable to identify two matching photos roughly four out of five times. In all the tests, the software falsely identified a match between two photos of different people less than one time in a thousand.

Levinson quickly sets about kicking through all the emotional debris of a house divided by its pain and its past. Lynn's ex, Paul (Thomas Hayden Church), got custody of Dylan years ago in their bad breakup and raised him with his brassy, bitter new wife (Demi Moore, nearly spitting nails with every word she directs at Lynn). She took their troubled daughter Alice (Kate Bosworth), who cuts rather than cries and has built a new life that includes an overly steady (sedated?) husband, played by a glassy-eyed Jeffrey DeMunn, and two sons.

Has anyone gotten an explanation of the referee's ruling allowing Chiefs coach Todd Haley to withdraw his challenge of the muffed punt call in the first quarter of Sunday's game? He threw the red flag on the field, then the whole crew talked with him for about 90 seconds before they declared that he had withdrawn his challenge "after consulting with his ssistant coaches." Can anyone just throw the flag out to stop the game, then stall for a while to get a look at more replays, then withdraw a challenge? As you know, that saved the Chiefs a timeout, and it may have come in handy at the end of the first half. -- Guy Rosenthal, Wheaton

If Congress fails to act this month, taxpayers at every income level face a significant tax increase at the start of the year. The new Congress -- with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate -- still could extend the tax cuts retroactively next year.

Dan Wetzel, Yahoo! Sports: "(Tebow) isn't a very attractive backup. He isn't an ideal guy for a quarterback derby. The fan pressure could be too great. If two legends such as John Elway and Peyton Manning don't want him on the depth chart, then how do less-established, less-legendary combinations take that route? At this point Tebow is a prisoner to his own off-the-field popularity, a rather tough reality considering he didn't really try to create it in the first place. No, Tebow hasn't shied away from attention or outreach or providing a running testimony for his faith. However, he also has turned down a million chances to feed the fire. This could be bigger. Way bigger. He could be basking in this popularity far more than he is. Instead he remains a mostly low-key, off-the-beaten path, just-give-me-a-chance-to-improve kind of guy."

But we were game. Vertigo be damned, we carved through talus and threaded the Gates of Mordor, two spires of stone, and from the summit we breathed deeply of our accomplishment, stunned by the sight of the Du Cane Range to the south rising and falling in a succession of valleys, glacier-carved more than 10,000 years ago.

The new location of this popular sushi spot is now officially slopeside, which means that if you're headed to a lift or trail, you can slurp seafood, then hit it - or vice versa. Either way, the ode to pink that was this laid-back eatery's décor is gone, replaced by a sleek, light blue-and-black look, with a little orange thrown in here and there, that fits with the offbeat menu. Think Japanese with a little bit of other Asian fare thrown in, with a twist, such as seared scallops with truffle ponzu or hamachi with miso mustard glaze. 15 W.

It was hard to imagine how the rest of the day's events at the courthouse could possibly compare, but I trudged across the street anyway and again found myself observing the seven-lawyer slugfest known as Nguyen v.

The reporting of unemployment rates is as good of an example as any. Some people believe only those receiveing unemployment checks are counted as unemployed. Not true. The statistic is better than that, but not perfect.
Top Picks Analysis: The Ravens were able to trade out of the first round and still manage to land the player they might have had their sights set on with their original pick at No. 29. Upshaw was one of this draft's biggest sliders after struggling mightily in agility drills at the combine, but the Defensive MVP of this past season's BCS National Championship Game is a powerful pass rusher with an advanced array of moves who can be utilized as either a down lineman or standing up as a 3-4 linebacker. Baltimore then obtained a potential replacement for departing left guard Ben Grubbs in Osemele, an oversized college tackle with great length and natural strength who needs some technical refinement and carries some questions about his work ethic. Baltimore moved up in the third round for Pierce, a balanced big back with cutback ability who'll take over for the retired Ricky Williams as Ray Rice's main caddy.

Nor should it be much of a surprise that the growth of the web and social media as the new public square has made it a rich source of funding. Putting aside the biggest and most frequent fundraising challenge -- political campaigns that will draw billions of dollars through electronic solicitations this year -- crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding have helped pay for new companies, record albums and even charities.

The first film in 14 years from writer-director Whit Stillman ("Barcelona," "The Last Days of Disco") is a slight piece of work, but agreeably peculiar. The damsels of the title are New England college coeds who make it their mission to uplift their campus' male barbarians and do some good for humankind. Violet (Greta Gerwig) leads the young ladies into volunteer service at the campus Suicide Prevention Center, where they offer doughnuts, tap dance lessons and scented soaps to the forlorn visitors. The film skewers Violet's cockeyed do-gooderism, but we never question her sincerity. Rated PG-13; mature themes, some sexual content. 1 hour, 39 minutes. By Colin Covert, Star Tribune (Minneapolis).

Then she started spending the rest of her life trying to prove how irresistible she was, going after only men who were taken - men for whom she had absolutely no desire - just to see if she was enticing enough to pry them away from their women and into her bed.
