When it comes to nonfiction, however, Franzen seems unlikely to top an essay he wrote back in 1996. In "Perchance to Dream," which ran in Harper's, he described being a novelist in a culture that no longer valued the novel. "The Corrections" came out a few years later, and every interviewer wanted to ask about "the Harper's essay" and his promise to write a headline-grabbing novel, just to prove it could still be done. In fact, the essay made no such promises, but you could see how people might misread something as cranky, conflicted and fascinating as it was.

Last month, the Obama administration laid out stricter fuel-economy rules for the auto industry, raising fleetwide average efficiency to 35.5 mpg by 2016. That's likely to benefit Honda, which already has a sturdy lineup of fuel-efficient cars like the Fit, the Civic and the Insight hybrid. But it also means it will have to confront new competitors armed with a wider lineup of fuel-efficient cars.

"These buyout offers saved the county more than $2 million, maybe $2.6 million. They're no different than what the state did with teachers or what the auto industry did in the past. (In April), we offered buyouts and got a bigger response than we thought we'd get. About 55 management people said yes. If we let them all take it, we'd have had practically all directors of all departments gone at the same time. So we approved 40 immediately, and with the other 15, we said we want to stagger out over a year because we don't want the brain drain to completely hit. ... Then last October with everything swirling around, I said, 'Just put a stop on everything now and let's look at all the benefit plans and everything that's happened.'

WASHINGTON -- It is widely, though not universally, assumed that the Federal Reserve will soon move to bolster the economy by trying to nudge down long-term interest rates on Treasury bonds, home mortgages and corporate bonds. Just how much rates would decline and how much production and employment would increase are uncertain. What's clearer is that the move would be something of an act of desperation, reflecting a poverty of good ideas to resuscitate the economy.

ESPN Zone aims to be the ultimate sports bar and grill, with more than 150 TVs and lots of team T-shirts and hats that you'd better not wear to the bowling alley across the way. But ESPN wants to be family-friendly too. Hence its Sports Arena arcade upstairs. Among the bright lights, bells, buzzers and weaponry of its 45 games, there are a few contests a 5-year-old can handle. So we tiptoed into the din, bought the required card and swiped it to get a few games going. Of course, the ESPN people charge fairly stiff prices, and they've made it a hassle to collect the unspent credit on your card. But really, who goes looking for conscientious capitalism in an arcade? We spent about $10, got about 20 minutes' amusement, and introduced Grace to her second new major sport of the day: air hockey. It was an OK deal.

Much the same principal is at work in more bodily forms of guidance and coaching; both the "couch potato" hoping to lose a few pounds and the Olympic athlete striving to break a world record can make good use of a physical trainer. So, too, both the enthusiastic (or tentative) beginner and the seasoned "prayer warrior" are equally apt to benefit from this sort of partnership with a spiritual director.

When prosecutors pressed him later, though, he said police didn't coerce him to talk and that he wasn't providing false information to protect himself or his girlfriend from unrelated drug and gun charges.

Indeed, within the inchoate "tea party" movement, Palin is lauded not for her credentials but for who she is perceived to be. She is regular folks. She shares their resentments, gives voice to their grievances. In this sense, she is eerily reminiscent of Richard Nixon, the scrappy kid born of humble origins who made a career of politicizing resentments, inveighing against the elite Eastern establishment that sought (in his telling) to keep him down. Today, none of Palin's rivals can match her Nixonesque ties to the "tea party" voters who will be crucial to the GOP's prospects in 2012.

I’m online dating, and I’m uncomfortable giving my number out, probably because I’m reluctant to give a stranger several ways to access me. Also, I consider myself a good judge of character, and phone calls don’t reveal as much as seeing a man’s mannerisms, body language, etc. I like to get to know a man through emails and then meet and, if the chemistry is there, open myself up to calls. This arrangement seemed fine until today, when it was greatly stressed that a phone conversation would help the process along.
Back when he was in his 30s, Brown installed a lawyer with no judicial experience as Supreme Court chief justice, farmworkers' advocates to oversee agricultural practices, and a CalTrans chief who annoyed commuters by turning fast lanes on clogged urban arteries over to carpoolers.

Prosecco is a simple wine and therein lies its appeal. Producers and sellers, however, prefer it be called by its proper name, as long as a Verdi libretto: Prosecco Superiore Valdobbiadene Conegliano DOCG; gussy up its bottles with all manner of cork, string or wire; and insist it be placed alongside the Champagne on the wine list. All that is just a tuxedo on a teenager. What's distinguishing in the following recommendations for prosecco, I note.
But it's an election-year document, designed to maximize a short-term political advantage over the reeling Democrats, and the very best thing that can be said about it is that it can go out with the trash the day after Election Day. Perhaps then the Republicans can come up with a plan that isn't so much a statement of lost confidence in the American people.

Billy's strapped to a gurney, on his way to custody.

Joshua Ledet, "Ain't Too Proud To Beg:" It's always fun to see Joshua work an uptempo song, because he does so many ballads on "Idol." Taking on the Temptations, he delivers like a pro, and even tosses in some playful choreography which finds him moving with the backing vocalists.

Nobody ever made a viral video about Thomas Lubanga.

It is true that management of school trust lands can be improved and that more money can be gained from them for the state's classrooms.

So far, this rebuilding program in St. Louis is unfolding at warp speed in the Jeff Fisher coaching era.

The verse the president quoted, in context, differs from the spin he placed on it. True charity has a purpose beyond the satisfaction of physical needs. Its objective is to change hearts so that whatever is making someone poor will help them become less so. Meeting physical needs is the primary work of the church and individuals, not government, which changes no heart and does a poor job of making people self-sustaining. Government should be a last resort, not a first resource.
