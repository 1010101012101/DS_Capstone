I don't mind people calling or e-mailing to complain. What I don't understand is why a lot of people have to be so rude about it. I see more of this everyday. People call up and just start yelling and screaming. If you are one of them, you really need to calm down. I will be more inclined to hear you or help you when you call if you are nice about it. Last week, I was suppose to stay at a hotel outside of Washington D.C. The hotel had me booked for the same dates last month. Unfortunately, they were now full. I didn't yell. I didn't scream. I complained but nicely. The hotel put me up in another hotel, free of charge. The clerk thanked me for being patient. I think most people yell and scream because they think they have to. In most cases, you will get the same result without having to lose your temper.

There will representations of menehune, the mythical small people of Hawaiian culture who were said to come out at night to build structures (the Menehune Ditch on Kauai is the most famous example).

"Through constant exposure on television, the Three Stooges have fared much better than the Marx Brothers. I love the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy. And I love the Stooges.

After passing through a narrow corridor at the entrance, I found a small bar winding along the wall to the right, an elevated DJ booth to the left, and a large wooden dance floor covering the center area. At one end of the dance floor was a small stage, complete with go-go dancer cages, and pool tables filled the space at the fourth end.

The walls, decorated with a brick and stone arch motif, gave the bar — strangely enough — an bit of a Mediterranean feel.

Colangelo sounded willing to give New Orleans guard Eric Gordon a chance, saying it's "still possible" he'd merit consideration despite playing most of this season with an injured knee.

But it would help Woodson’s case if he had a better showing tonight, the way his team needs a better showing tonight. This is the pros, not CYO, and you can’t blame the coach all the time when a team gathers technical and bad fouls, the prime goal isn’t to win the Sportsmanship Plaque.

Dogs pick up cues and signals in amazingly short order. In this case, the Doberman has a clear indication from its human (the gentleman friend) that your mom is welcome.

Charles Mee's delightfully dizzying, non-linear play "bobrauschenbergamerica" is a contradiction of sorts.

A cover letter is a sales letter that sells you as a candidate. Just like the resume, it should be compelling and give the main reasons you should be called for an interview. Winning cover letter tips include emphasizing your top accomplishments or creating subheadings culled from the job posting. For example:

“It really was, I think, a huge disappointment to the men and women of the Secret Service to begin with, who uphold very high standards and who feel their own reputations are now besmirched by the actions of a few,” Napolitano said.
Dear Margo: I just started my dream job. (I literally used to dream about working at this particular establishment when I was a child.) Now I'm in a bit of a jam. There's a man I work with, indirectly. He is higher up the chain. I was chummy with him the first few weeks (purely platonic), and he had a big birthday bash. I was invited and wanted to come, but I fell ill and could not make it. During one of our talks, I told him I was going on a cruise with my family and would be stopping by a special place in Mexico that's owned by a rock star. He happens to be a big fan of this musician and begged me to bring him back a shirt. I said sure and that I'd give it to him as a birthday present to make up for my absence. Long story short, we ended up not going to that side of Mexico, and when I let him know, he sent me a link to where I could order his shirts. (He picked out two.) I told him I couldn't afford this. When I came back from the cruise, he instantly asked about his shirts. I got embarrassed and said I had ordered them (lie) and that there had been a mix-up (lie again) and would be a delay (lie). I am usually a blunt and honest person, so I have no idea why I lied. The point is that I am really too broke (being a full-time student who only works part time) to buy this guy shirts and have them shipped from Mexico to where we live in Europe. But I lied and told him I would. How do I get out of this without losing face at my place of work, and how do I avoid these types of situations in the future? — Lies Are Expensive

Yet IMVU recorded four consecutive quarters of record revenue in 2008, accelerating even as the economy crashed, Rosenzweig says. With the holiday season over, business was expected to slow a bit — but January delivered another uptick, he said. Why? One theory suggests that people with maxed-out credit cards were substituting low-cost shopping sprees in the virtual realm for trips to the mall.

Their false expectations were set by politicians who should have known better. Shortly after the protests began, their "general assembly" debated whether to risk bringing in tents. New York politicians and the liberal community board representing Lower Manhattan issued statements suggesting that First Amendment rights were absolute, emboldening protesters into thinking they could take over the park indefinitely.
The scene: A mountain lodge dominated by heli-skiers in winter, heli-hikers in summer, about 200 miles west of Calgary and 30 miles from the nearest paved road. Built in the 1960s, this lodge faces the snowy molars of the Purcell mountain range, and its copters connect visitors to extraordinary hikes. As in the old days, there are no TVs or phones in rooms, but now there is Wi-Fi. (In renovations by Canadian Mountain Holidays since my summer 1997 visit, it's gained 11 rooms and a rooftop hot tub.)

His remarks, part of a discussion with evangelical leader James Dobson, came hours after the former Pennsylvania senator suspended his presidential bid. Though he did not directly say why he was quitting the race, earlier he alluded to his youngest daughter’s serious medical condition as well as the delegate math working against him. Santorum did not endorse Republican front-runner Mitt Romney, but he did speak with the near-certain nominee Tuesday, and he received good wishes from others in the GOP establishment, such as formerPresidentGeorge W. Bush, who has not endorsed a candidate in the election. The conversations reflect Santorum’s transformation in the last year, from a political has-been who lost his last electoral contest by 17 points to a viable candidate for the presidential nomination and a spokesman for the party’s most conservative voters.

Tressel probably still had more detractors than backers, but Park said initially it was the same way with Hayes in 1978. Though the punch isn't forgotten, for many OSU fans who still buy Hayes T-shirts, caps, bobbleheads and photos, it's not what they remember first or most often.

The report highlighted continuing gaps between the performance of boys and girls on mandated state tests in math and some areas of science, although not biology, where girls have pulled even. But the gender gap for advanced algebra, geometry, physics and chemistry has remained fairly constant in recent years, with girls tending to fall further behind as they reach more advanced math and science subjects.

"Monsieur Lazhar," in subtitled French, was an Oscar nominee this year for best foreign language film. The plot rests on a few somewhat arbitrary notions, but the drama's greatest strength lies in its specificity. Far from dispensing glib uplift, Lazhar stresses classroom discipline, teaches the value of respect and pushes forcefully, sometimes clumsily, against an overprotective culture so benighted in the name of enlightenment that such subjects as death and violence have been stricken from the curriculum. He's forbidden from circulating the text of Alice's wonderful speech, and he's reminded, in what amounts to a reprimand, that there's zero tolerance for touching students, whether in the course of corporal punishment—he has, in fact, given an obstreperous kid named Simon a little whack on the back of his head—or a heartfelt hug. (The issue of hugging turns out to be more fraught than Lazhar could have imagined.)
øA: Barring a disaster out of Europe, I do see a fairly broad, growing economy. The economy is in a mild recovery, which is strengthening. Corporations are in outstanding financial shape. They're earning money. They've got plenty of capital, plenty of wherewithal. Middle-market companies, of which most are private companies with sales of between $20 million and $2 billion, they are in fabulous financial shape and have good margins. They have a lot of capital and liquidity. We see small businesses in better shape. But we are not seeing a huge formation of small businesses yet.

Mike Vaccaro, New York Post: "We can obsess for months - will obsess for months - over what we don't know about Tim Tebow. Will he ever develop a professional arm? Don't know. Can he replicate, at all, what he created in Denver, when for a few fleeting moments it seemed he could perform the Jedi mind trick on one defense after another? Don't know. Will he be a distraction in the locker room? Kryptonite for Mark Sanchez? A target of envy, derision, or both by jealous teammates? Don't know. It will be fascinating - or a fiasco. Right now, it's guesswork, all of it. So yesterday was for discovering things we can be sure of about this new addition to the Jets' toy box of personality. Tebow surely delivered that much. We talk all the time about new coaches standing in front of skeptical scribes and winning the press conference, but that is precisely what Tebow did."

"The Beginner's Goodbye" confines itself to months, specifically the months following the death of Aaron's wife, Dorothy. The two are in the middle of an ordinary marital moment -- Aaron comes home early from work with a cold, the two have a small quarrel over caretaking and the location of the Triscuits -- when a tree falls on the house, inflicting wounds on Dorothy from which she eventually dies and wounds on Aaron from which he eventually learns how to live.
I forgot to mention to my opponent that I once had an, um, encounter in a drinking establishment with former heavyweight champion of the world Leon Spinks.
Rams fans should be wary of comeback cases at wide receiver. Remember the high hopes for Mark Clayton and Danario Alexander? Should Smith have an explosive training camp, fans can become guardedly optimistic about his prospects for 2012. If his knee holds up to the camp rigors and banging around of preseason play, then, OK, consider him a factor. But this franchise has become a place where wounded knees come to die. It is impossible to regard Smith as anything more than a depth guy at this point.
As some shoppers worked to undercut others, Goodwill adopted new policies. Bill Goman, the manager who oversees this region's four outlets, estimates that about 75 percent of the problem has gone away thanks to what he describes as "draconian measures" that worked.

La Russa used his bullpen aggressively in the season and even more aggressively in the postseason, as starters got quick hooks in favor of the tag team from the pen. He steadfastly refused to give Motte the title of closer, even though it was he who invariably entered in save situations after Salas had a brief run at the job earlier in the summer.

There is talk of a "predator city" and a "ninth ray" but precisely what they are remains somewhat mysterious. Most of the action takes place on a planet called Barsoom (we call it Mars) inhabited by a race called the Tharks, savage, primitive, towering beings with four arms and horns who go in for gladiatorial sports, and a group of slightly better dressed, tattooed humans who call themselves "red" but are in fact more orange-y, sort of like the cast of "Jersey Shore" without the sexually transmitted diseases.

Defense lawyers for Tremayne Johnson called Craig Beyler, a fire protection engineer, to the stand as an expert witness. Beyler said police mishandled clothing seized from the Johnsons' South Baltimore home by mixing two pairs of jeans and a pair of sneakers in one bag.

Eva (Swinton) is a former travel writer; we see her footloose in flashbacks, beaming. But she and her husband, Franklin (John C. Reilly), start a family, so they move to the suburbs. When Kevin (played as a toddler by Rock Duer, as a child by Jasper Newell and as a teen by Ezra Miller) is born, Eva seems to harbor something like regret, maybe resentment -- but nothing more than many parents feel about such a big change in their lives.

House poor: Danielle gets a visit from Karin, her realtor; she's considering selling her house, although she says that her husband gets half the sale, so she's not very motivated. She is very proud of her bathroom, the nicest in Wayne. It has a bidet! She doesn't want to spend any money to fix up the house, which she says cost nearly $2 million to buy and now will be listed for $1.495 million. She also whines to the realtor about her husband not sending her money on time, if at all (this is the husband of whom Danielle once said, "There's no finer man in the world").

“It was a lot better today,” he said. “What I was doing last time is from the stretch I was too wide. That was causing me to be too quick in my lower body and my upper body was having to catch up. Being a little bit more narrow over the rubber, having my hands a little bit closer to my body will allow my upper body to be quicker in time with my lower body. That’s a timing mechanism I look for in the wind-up. If I’m able to get that same feeling out of the stretch, I’ll have no problem commanding my pitches.”

added to fears that Europe's woes would hurt the entire financial system. If one or more European governments default, that would unleash a shock to the world's financial system that at the very least would lead to recessions in the United States and Europe, severe losses for banks and a global stranglehold on lending.

6. Oquendo showed a lot of class in his reaction to the Matheny hiring. And he displayed even more class by expressing a desire to remain on the coaching staff. We'll see what Mozeliak and Matheny decide here. It would be nice to see Oquendo continue. And if Oquendo isn't invited to remain on as third-base coach? Well, that would surely stir things up.
Passing up a cost-effective way to save the lives of millions of children wouldn't just be immoral, it would be fiscally irresponsible. Malaria is a prime cause of global poverty, instability, overpopulation and misery. If the G-8 members cannot agree to kick in $4 billion to make this disease a thing of the past, the whole notion of multilateral development assistance will have proved a sham.

In 2006, when James Frey's "A Million Little Pieces" was exposed as a fraud, the news was met with the self-righteousness and scorn typically reserved for Ponzi schemers. Ever since, Frey's name has been invoked with the arrival of every challenged memoir -- and they arrive regularly, our mounting suspicion having done little to quench our appetite for the form.
A hair under 6 feet 5, Streeter has excellent downfield speed for his size. At the scouting combine, he ran the 40-yard dash at 4.40 seconds, which was among the top times among wide receivers. But there are questions about his route-running and other areas of his game will need to be polished.

It makes me wonder whether this new law will prove to be yet another regulatory hurdle that will get in the way of small-business owners who we need to lead the economic revival. And because it's the workers who have to pay to get the new "food handler cards," it seems like the little guy is getting hosed, again.

Pryor and Gruden: Former Ohio State quarterback Terrelle Pryor filmed a session with ESPN analyst Jon Gruden in Florida on Saturday what will be turned into the latest installment of Gruden’s “QB Camp.” Gruden grilled several quarterbacks, like Auburn’s Cam Newton and Washington’s Jake Locker, before April’s NFL Draft and now did the same with Pryor, who is preparing for the NFL’s supplemental draft in July.
More albums, downtime and reunions followed, and today Crack the Sky enjoys a satisfied part-time existence.

The problem with trying to establish unity is that it requires that all Americans compromise or capitulate some or all of their values and ideals. And judging from the viciousness and anger of the three recent national elections and the way this 2012 election is shaping up, compromise or capitulation of deeply held beliefs by liberals and conservatives is the last thing either side is willing to do.
We believe Baltimore residents should be served by a locally controlled utility that provides affordable, reliable energy for customers — not by a distant corporation that generates windfall profits for executives. Baltimore deserves better than the deal that Constellation and Exelon are selling. We shouldn't be forced to flee from sweltering homes anymore.
Deputy Mayor Kaliope Parthemos has said a new agreement would not have to be awarded through a formal request for proposals process but that it would need to be approved by the Board of Estimates. Because the mayor controls the Board of Estimates, that's not a particularly significant safeguard. The mayor needs to announce all the terms of a prospective agreement and the identity of new managers well before submitting the deal for approval, so the public can have confidence that we aren't repeating last year's mistakes. All that may increase the difficulty of coming to an agreement in time to salvage this year's race, but it's better to risk having no race at all than to put on another entertaining but costly event.

Sizzling summer days also hold threats. When it's hot, fluids and lubricants can break down more rapidly, tires are subject to more stress and a vehicle suffers more wear and tear. In weather extremes like these, it's more important than ever to have your car serviced regularly and to use common sense on the road. If you don't, high pump prices won't be the only menace to happy motoring you'll face this summer.

In "Where I Was From," her 2003 memoir about growing up in the state, Didion identifies "the California conundrum." Whether in relation to Yosemite's mass or "the Pacific trembling on its tectonic plates, the slightest shift of which could and with some regularity did destroy the works of man in a millisecond," she writes, "all human beings were of course but as worms, their 'heroic imperatives' finally futile, their philosophical inquiries vain."

That is because batting average and wins probably are the two stats most devalued during the metric revolution. There is a far greater value on hits/walk-driven on-base percentage than hits-driven batting average. That is why I believe Bobby Abreu (.397 on-base percentage/.878 OPS) will be viewed by the saber community as a far more attractive candidate than Damon (.353/.789) when they are both up for election.

To put the problem in the simplest terms, the interests of the client continue to be sidelined in the way the firm operates and thinks about making money. Goldman Sachs is one of the world's largest and most important investment banks and it is too integral to global finance to continue to act this way.

The case and the coverage it has received have set off spirited discussion on several news sites. Some argued that the arrests and publicity will be useful in dissuading others who might want to procure sex in a public place. Others said the attention given to the suspects, who have not been charged, echoed the public shaming visited on gays in decades past.

Imagine if the Environmental Protection Agency announced it had conducted a study that showed that benzene levels in a refinery along the Houston Ship Channel were three times higher than the level considered safe for short-term exposure. There would be an army of regulators from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and every other alphabet soup agency descending on the place. A horde of plaintiffs' attorneys would be greeting workers as they left the plant. It would be splashed across the headlines of this paper and investigative news teams from every television news station would be set up with their satellite trucks outside the plant.
A few weeks ago, he was driving from his Sunni village, Binnish, to another town for work.

He is undersized but fast enough to get past safeties, and has the route-running savvy to outwork corners, create separation and make plays. His size might limit his pro potential, but many receivers of his stature have succeeded in the NFL. Benjamin has third- to fourth-round value."

19. Jason Day, Australia -- There still is no indication as to when Day will return from a tendon injury in his left foot and ankle, which forced him to withdraw from the Masters after seven holes in round two. His original schedule had him playing last week in the Valero Texas Open, but he told tournament officials after leaving Augusta that he would be unable to make it. The Aussie missed the cut in his only three previous appearances in the tournament, but all of those were at La Cantera, and he was looking forward to playing at TPC San Antonio, which became the tournament venue in 2010. … Day, who took painkillers simply to make it to the first tee at Augusta, continues to undergo treatment and take medication to heal the injury. He said at Augusta National that doctors told him the injury would take two to six weeks to heal and that he was playing only because it was the first major of the year, in which he tied for second a year ago. He said it was difficult just to walk, and going 25 holes on the hilly fairways at Augusta could not have been easy. … Day won't be at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans this week, and this is nearly a month since he sustained the injury during a training session the week before the Masters. The best-case scenario would seem to be a return next week at the Wells Fargo Championship, in which he tied for 22nd in his only appearance, in 2010.

A. Compared to how it could have gone, yes. Compared to them getting off, not doing any time, and compared to other victims that I have worked with as an advocate and seen how their perpetrators have never even been caught, or the D.A. decided we don't have enough evidence to pursue it – yes, I do believe that I got justice. Do I feel that it was enough time that they served? No. But at the same time, I don't think any victim ever feels that the time their perpetrator is behind bars is enough for what they take from them.

Walsh is expected to issue an order in the coming weeks.
There is good reason to fear that the deficit committee enforcement mechanisms the president and congressional leaders negotiated won't work. The mix of cuts to domestic programs and defense is designed to be sufficiently unpalatable to both sides that it will heighten the incentive to compromise, but it's not clear that Republicans will seek to avoid defense cuts at all costs. In a world in which virtually the entire GOP caucus has signed a pledge to never allow an increase in taxes under any circumstances, the normal rules don't apply. Whatever the committee comes up with is likely either to fail or to be a compromise in name only.

At Crenshaw, I see what has been sketchily described on the radio for the last couple of hours: figures rendered to silhouettes, occupying the street, advancing randomly. Shouting, laughing, they drift on foot into traffic, into the beams of headlights, as if they are truly invincible. My tires eat glass, trundle over big, splintered husks of plywood, of brick and clods of dirt. On my left I see a waterfall of glass. I don't hear the sound of it breaking: this scene has no soundtrack, no narrative line to hold on to. Out of the other window I watch six pairs of hands pry apart white iron security gates. Here I see an ironic twist on the multiethnic coalition that local community leaders have been talking about for years, but not successfully implementing: black and Latino teenagers coming together to lift a sofa out of a furniture store's showcase window, onto shoulders, then down the sidewalk.
