ø18. San Diego Chargers: GM A.J. Smith probably needed to knock this draft out of the park and may very well have succeeded. OLB Melvin Ingram could be a gift after he fell to 18th and DL Kendall Reyes (Round 2) and S Brandon Taylor (Round 3) could contribute immediately. TE Ladarius Green (Round 4) and C David Molk (Round 7) are nice prospects who offer hope with TE Antonio Gates and C Nick Hardwick slowing down.

It is with some sadness that this reader reports that the playful, effervescent voice of Banana Yoshimoto in her 1993 bestseller "Kitchen" has been replaced in "The Lake" with the equally fascinating but somewhat less elastic voice of an older, world-weary writer. "Live like a flower," once advised the mother of Chihiro, the narrator. Now approaching 30, Chihiro, an artist living in Tokyo, is having a difficult time finding her own perspective and her own voice. How to see the world? In one light, a room looks sad and dingy, in another, beautiful and poetic.

Arriving at Zuccotti Park late Friday night, days after New York City police evicted protesters, I thought the same as I surveyed the relatively small remaining band of occupiers outnumbered by officers and mixed with a blend of New York City homeless, though I did not see my nephew. Protesters were identifiable by their placards and a potpourri of impassioned conversations that in the cold, open, New York night air felt like a grassroots revival of sorts, even if their overall message was somewhat disjointed and hard to decipher.

In Syria, the fall of President Bashar al-Assad would unleash a cataclysm of chaos, sectarian strife and extremism that spreads far beyond its borders, threatening not only the entrenched rulers already battling to hold at bay a clamor for democratic change but also the entire balance of power in the volatile region, analysts and experts say.
-- The only Cardinals with at least three hits in the first two games of a season are Enos Slaughter (1938), Tony Scott (1979) and Showboat Fisher (1930). Furcal and Freese both have that opportunity today having already had three hits apiece in the opener Wednesday night.

"First down," might as well be, "I love you." In fact, I've heard Ducks fans talk about Essig's butter-smooth voice as though it belonged to their spouse.

Using the Joplin twister as an example, Kramper says the optimized tornado warning would confirm that the storm was spotted by radar and law enforcement officials. Hazards would include 2.75-inch, "baseball-size" hail. The storm itself would be "life-threatening," and capable of "catastrophic damage." Kramper notes, however, that "catastrophic" would be used only to describe a confirmed "violent" EF-4 or EF-5 tornado.

Handedness: Summer- and spring-borns are more likely to be left-handed. A study published in 1994 in the journal Perceptual and Motor Skills examined handedness among males conscripted to the French army, male American baseball players and data collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the National Center for Health Statistics. It showed that 41.2% of all left-handed people were born in the five months from March to July, but only 38.2% of all right-handed people. According to psychology professor Maryanne Martin (University of Oxford) and Gregory Jones (University of Warwick), authors of a 1999 study that confirmed these results, it's not yet clear why such differences exist; possible factors include variations in maternal nutrition or exposures to sunshine, temperature or seasonal infections, such as flu or measles, during the second trimester of pregnancy.

Mayor Dana Redd of Camden, who was forced to lay off almost half the city’s 368-member police force in January, said in a statement that she welcomed the "realistic and cost-effective" option of a regional police force.

We dancers used to take the train from New York's Penn Station to Philly every Saturday afternoon, do the show at 7 p.m., then hop back aboard the train to reach home (New York) by 11 that night. That year was also one of the two years I played a student on MISTER PEEPERS, starring Wally Cox and Tony Randall, which meant I had to be at the RKO Center Theater in Rockefeller Center to begin the PEEPERS rehearsals the next morning at 7 o'clock. No wonder I was so skinny in those days. Everything was "live" in those days. No tape, no film.

The college admissions process for the class of 2016 is thankfully over, save for those still on wait lists. With social media growing rapidly, much of the intimacy of delivering good news about college — and pretty much everything else — has disintegrated. These days, when applicants are admitted to college, their friends and followers now know instantly. Many post "Official _____ Class of 2016" while others revert to ALL CAPS and an annoying overload of !!!!!!!!!!s. Even if someone doesn't post news about his acceptance, a quickly growing string of "Congratulations!!!" will flood his wall, thanks to Facebook bundling topically similar posts.

But the Chicago Police Department is doing everything it can to stall or stop the release of unredacted reports, street files and lineup photos that could perhaps explain why it took the cops a full 25 days after Koschman was hit and 14 days after he was dead to set eyes on Vanecko at Area 3 police headquarters.

The U.S. occupation is the primary target for the Afghan insurgency, which makes an enormous military presence inherently destabilizing to the Afghan nation. Recent revelations have underscored this reality, such as the photos of soldiers posing with dead insurgents, and the accidental mass burning of Qurans. It is no surprise that Afghans are growing more resentful of the American military presence. The international community could play a constructive role in helping Afghans rebuild their country and strengthen their government. But the trust needed to build that kind of partnership between Afghans and Americans is sorely lacking. A clear and responsible plan to withdraw U.S. troops as soon as possible would be a first step in building that trust.

Should he be faulted for playing to his strengths? There is certainly something to be said for challenging yourself, but such an excellent, underrated film as "Minority Report," a much bleaker take on the science-fiction genre, doesn't really fit the traditional Spielberg mold.

And we made microwave technology portable.

It felt terrible to leave without her, but once I got over the initial sadness, I tried to focus on the positive. I would have been terrified to take her home at that point. And after having a C-section, I was able to get some real sleep and rest for two weeks and recover, knowing that she was in great hands. Going back and forth to the NICU was difficult because I had to rely on others to drive me as I was still recovering from surgery.

øA: We see opportunities in everything from construction to toys to photography that is software driven and where technology companies have a real chance to become dominant in very large industries. Take toys and the amount of intelligence that you can apply to toys to make them much more interesting and real just with software and robotics technology. Another example we're invested in, Lytro, is changing photography. With Lytro, you can retake the picture after the fact, change the focus or lighting or change the perspective and look at it in 3-D. Another we're invested in is Jawbone, which makes a health bracelet that monitors your sleep, your activity, and tells you, 'Gee, you got a good night's rest last night,' or 'You only slept for a few hours and only got two hours of deep sleep and, as a result of that, you might want to drink a little more water today' and those kind of interactive things.

Had depressed older adults simply made more poor decisions, leading to more regret? Or did their tendency to blame themselves more for their losses make them depressed?

Obama's veto message also alluded to a requirement for the construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to Texas that Republicans said would create 20,000 jobs.

I can understand the Sox unloading John Danks and Carlos Quentin and, to some extent, Gavin Floyd. I have yet to read why the salary savings couldn't have been used to keep Mark Buehrle. He's pitched well on poor Sox teams before (oh yeah, just like the 2011 team). Since he's a Sox icon, I'm flabbergasted at how Buehrle could be allowed to leave all the while the team is shedding salary. -- Damian Davis, Calif.

Where or how R.C. came upon the term "voluntaryist" remains a mystery. He may have come across it in his religious studies, since the term was originality applied to the manner in which churches were voluntarily supported in this country and England, as opposed to the establishment and funding of a State church. R.C. was not totally anti-electoral, for he did support Goldwater in his bid for the presidency. He was, however, clearly an advocate of an all-voluntary society, one in which the person who did not wish to pay for government protection should not receive such protection nor be forced to pay for a service he did not receive. In the latter part of 1958 and the early part of 1959, he gave several public talks to such groups as the Unitarian Fellowship of Orange County and the Exchange Club of Santa Ana. The subject of these presentations was "voluntaryism." He chose this theme because he sincerely thought that to the degree that more and more people believed in and practiced voluntaryism "the more they will increase their happiness, their physical and spiritual health, their peace of mind and their prosperity." The message of Jesus Christ, and as R.C. was to fondly add, the Ten Commandments, The Golden Rule and the Declaration of Independence, was clearly voluntaryist at heart. "If it is harmful for one to get things on an involuntary basis, or two people, it is harmful for any number of people or for a government to got things by using involuntary means." He was optimistic that voluntaryism would triumph, just as chattel slavery had been abolished in this country. In his 1956 column, quoted above, he wrote that

The late October snowstorm was another weather anomaly. It caught many weather experts and highway officials by surprise, because it was expected to dump mostly rain and only a little bit of snow.

Ironic, then, that a resource as precious as seconds, minutes and hours is so poorly understood and so routinely misestimated by modern humans -- by 15% to 25% in either direction, depending on the individual and the acuity of his or her time perception.

No. 1: An Italian Moscato d'Asti is the perfect summer wine. It is made-to-order lightness combined with good acidity, a touch of sweet sunshine and bubbles to create poolside magic. I recommend Moscato d'Astis from Michele Chiarlo ($13-$15 half bottle), Ceretto ($24-$26 full bottle) or the hard-to-find but amazing Vietti ($21-$24 half bottle). Weighing in at a mere 5-5.5 percent total alcohol, these Italian beauties practically qualify as "near wine." Why do I advocate low alcohol? Take a Moscato and a 16 percent alcohol California Zin and head to the patio when the temp's hovering around "inferno." Pop the corks and see which one feels better. If you like the Zin, it's OK. Just be sure your hors d'oeuvre is a bowl of sliced habanero chiles and light a romantic fire while you burn, baby, burn!

This is the time when these trees or large shrubs begin to take a rest for the cooler months. All leaves are likely to be lost.

Teams play up to a 16-game season that starts after the college season. Players don't get paid, but some teams cover uniform, equipment and travel expenses.
The four second-year players provide 38 percent of the minutes played this season, more than any other class. That's a lot of responsibility dropped on players with just over 1½ years of collegiate experience. There have been great games by the sophomores and not-so-great games, though the good have outnumbered the bad. Evans, for instance, had 19 points and 11 rebounds against George Washington; two games later, he had no points and one rebound against Charlotte.

Just don't expect to get toned in only 10 minutes with weights as light as these.

"To be put in that category is a tremendous honor. It's something that a lot of hard work was put into and it goes to credit the way these guys played in front of me. Being a goaltender, it's a position that you're more dependent on your teammates than any other position in sports. For your goalie to be put in a category like that, it means these guys are doing a tremendous job, which they've done for me all year."

* Of course, the Votto signing has a downside. We've already talked about the potential for this deal turning into a burden in Votto's late-career seasons. But there are more immediate consequences; we'd have to think that the Votto investment precludes the Reds from spending big money on All-Star 2B Brandon Phillips. He can become a free agent after the season. Over the last six seasons Phillips is 4th among MLB second basemen in RBIs and homers. And it's certainly possible to envision a scenario that prevents the Reds from making future investments in other young players and prospects when it's time to pay them or lose them. This could change if new deals are made, but for now the Cardinals don't have to worry about being restricted due to long-term payroll obligations. That will likely be an issue for the Reds going forward. But again, over the next five-six seasons it will be challenging for any NL Central team to match the Votto-Bruce connection.

DISORDERLY CONDUCT, AURORA ROAD: When a Chicago Deli employee reported April 19 his white 1997 Dodge pickup had been stolen from outside of work, he mentioned someone the day before had driven the truck from his home on Forest Glenn Drive to the restaurant. At the time, he just figured it was his parents. After the truck was recovered this time around on Forest Glenn, police determined it had been a co-worker, 18, who admitted to taking the keys the day before and playing a prank on his friend, who in turn declined to have him arrested for grand theft auto, although police were not entirely forgiving.

The most vivid memory comes from 1964 or 1965 or maybe both. We would be, a handful of us, playing ball and onto the playground would walk Billy Williams, the Cubs great, holding the hand of one or more of his four daughters.

Good decision. The 25-minute hike is a little tricky in flip-flops but worth the effort. The fortress, built in 1579 by the Venetians, was used to fight the invading Turks until 1692, according to our Blue Guide. It was later used as a base for pirates (hence the pirate ship in the harbor). You can see why the spot was coveted. It offers 360-degree views of the sea and a prime view of ships crossing from Crete to the island of Antikythera. Today, the distressed walls and tumbledown arches make an ideal place for holiday snapshots.
We came for the sixth annual Cartagena Music Festival, most of which took place in the historic walled part of Cartagena, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.

He said the bill would add $145 million to an already out-of-balance budget in the next biennium. And he said it would provide $45.4 million in tax relief to businesses, but only $4.1 million in relief to homeowners "and virtually none to renters, seniors and farmers. This imbalance is unfair...."
