"Those 9-words that came out of my child's mouth - a child who wakes up every morning excited to learn, changed my life as a parent", Currie said. "9-words started this journey and 9-words will complete it."

Foursquare is a service that allows users to "check in" from their smartphones at coffee shops, bars and other locations. It is designed as a service for people who want to alert their friends who might be in the neighborhood. "Girls Around Me" was making it easier, however, for strangers to potentially identify nearby women. The app triggered an uproar, and Foursquare revoked its access to users' locations. In an email to the Journal, the developer of "Girls Around Me" said that the app "gives the user nothing more than the Foursquare app can provide itself."
We use the same system of percolation ponds that were developed in the early 1900s. These mini-lakes are seen along creeks throughout the county and are vital to "recharging" the groundwater basin. Currently, groundwater accounts for about 40 percent of our water supply.

At some subterranean level, we -- African Americans -- still believe the garbage of innate criminality we have so assiduously been fed, and struggle with hating ourselves, as America long ago taught us to do. We struggle with it, yet we know better from firsthand, man-in-the-mirror experience. So how much harder is the struggle for white folks?

The case hinged largely on the work of Dwek, a failed Monmouth County developer-turned undercover informant. His performance on the witness stand is likely to be closely followed by lawyers for other defendants in the case to determine if the one-time rabbinical student will be as effective in front of a jury as he was wearing a wire.
Now those colleagues have been charged with pummeling the 26-year-old during a hazing ritual after the Florida Classic football game with Bethune-Cookman.

I myself barely gave it much thought the first time I tried it. That is, until I reached the 10th floor of the Tower at Erieview, where I lost my breath and realized with nearly 30 more flights to go that okay, running stairs is hard work, a wholly different enterprise than the kind of running I'm accustomed to.

Is this too harsh? Regrettably, no. What gives me hope is that so many of the younger members of the Senate in both parties are giving voice to the frustration they feel with what the Senate has become. If their ranks are reinforced by this November's election, and if they start talking to each other and realize how widely shared their feelings of dissatisfaction are, perhaps the change could bubble up from within.

On Oahu, the "anyone can surf" attitude often gets people in over their heads, literally, on North Shore beaches during periods of big surf, while the year-round crushing shorebreak at Sandy Beach near the island's southeastern tip has sent many a would-be bodysurfer home with sprains, neck compressions and/or broken bones. (President Obama, like others who grew up on the island, may know what he's doing at Sandy's, as locals call it, but that doesn't mean you will.) The ambulance standing by in the parking lot is one clue.

Alison, in search of her personal grail, uses the life and work of British psychoanalyst and pediatrician Donald Winnicott as her map of discovery. Through the serial monogamy of Alison's loves, and her psychotherapists, Winnicott and her mother are the constants. But the route includes revelatory visits with Virginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich and the first published American poet, Anne Bradstreet, who arrived on these shores in 1630. There are segues to examine the history of psychoanalysis, and the surprising significance of "Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book." A strange resonance grows between a PBS broadcast of "The Forsyte Saga" and a family outing to see "The Sound of Music." In late-night stalking of city streets, in old letters and news items, in memories and postulations and dreams, the functional tumult of Bechdel's creating mind is revealed.

I would say the next game against Columbus at home is a must win game now. Columbus hasn't shown to be that good so far and if the Timbers can't stomp on them at home, then it may be all over psychologically for the players on this team. Even though there are a lot of games left, its starting to build up that they aren't good. While they MAY be good, it gets in all their minds and they just don't perform well week in and week out. A slow start is one thing, but its gone on too long now to

They're getting closer, but there are still a couple of steps to go. It's still a little sporadic. But it doesn't take much with the types of players they are."

Other companies limited my access to senior executives. An analyst without access to executives—and the one-on-one insights that investors often pay for—can be perceived to be at a disadvantage compared to his or her peers.

When I pushed a little harder for a meeting, I received a message that we needed to "have a conversation."

In 2008, University of Chicago researchers interviewed 3,000 people between the ages of 57 and 85 asking whether they had been subjected to physical or financial mistreatment in the preceding year; 3.5 percent said that a caregiver, relative, or financial adviser had improperly taken their money. (Again, the research excluded those suffering from dementia and other mental decline.)

There are a lot of things that people are now doing on their phones that used to require a PC. Neal Augenstein, a colleague at CBS News affiliate WTOP radio in Washington, D.C., pioneered the use of an iPhone to both record and edit radio news broadcasts.

More specifically, head for the Monastery of the Angels (1977 Carmen Ave., a mile from the Hollywood sign), where 17 cloistered nuns spend their days praying, eating, sleeping and making desserts. Hand $10 to the gift-shop volunteer for a hefty loaf of pumpkin bread — a fine souvenir, if it lasts that long. Then head two blocks east to Beachwood Drive, turn north toward the famous sign and keep going even after the road dwindles to dirt. There you'll find Sunset Ranch (3400 Beachwood Drive), where horses can be rented for guided rides (ages 8 and older). For $30 you get an hour. Start about 4 p.m. on a clear winter day and you'll get a different angle of the Hollywood sign, but better still, a Technicolor panorama with setting sun, a distant sliver of the Pacific, city lights at your feet and a whiff of horse manure to keep it real. The ranch is also the starting point for the Hollyridge Trail hike, which takes you near the fenced-off Hollywood sign, or you can explore the half-dozen public staircases threaded among the hillside homes. (Plot your route at http://www.beachwoodcanyon.org/Stairs.htm or buy Charles Fleming's 2010 paperback "Secret Stairs: A Walking Guide to the Historic Staircases of Los Angeles." And in the interest of full disclosure: Fleming is an L.A. Times editor.) When you're done, you'll want a thick slice of that pumpkin bread and maybe a nap in your room at the handy Best Western Plus Hollywood Hills Hotel (6141 Franklin Ave.). The hotel is a mid-range, retro-mod affair with signed glossies of Ray Charles and Marty Feldman on the lobby wall; the movie "Swingers" was written in the lobby-adjacent 101 Coffee Shop.

There are no slowpokes in this bunch. In fact, Stanford's stable of tailbacks is one of the best in school history. There have been other great backs on the Farm, but rarely if ever has there been this kind of depth at the position.
Actually, many San Francisco neighborhoods have built their reputations as places of unique, tight-knit cultures. Ours is a city that so identifies by neighborhood that it sometimes resembles Renaissance Italian city-states writ small. While the rest of the country happily paints us with a single broad brush, we excel in fine gradations of distinction. I recall a friend who lived in the Mission, who by then was no longer one of its hard-core bohemians (not a renter, not an artist, not poor and not even a lefty), ranting about "those people" in Noe Valley, an appellation that began a mere three blocks away from his home. Freud coined the term "the narcissism of small differences" to describe the human impulse to reserve our most virulent feelings for those who resemble us the most, but after nearly 20 years in San Francisco, I wonder if we don't have a special monopoly on this trait.
"I say this joking around. This guy Joe Lundardi has no agenda. How would you like to wake up in the morning and all you do is bracketology all day long? Can you imagine that? He doesn't pay attention to his wife, he doesn't pay attention to his children, all he does all night long is bracketology. So just follow him because his batting average is incredible. The only thing obviously is he doesn't know where teams go, so if he does they're in, they're in. Everybody call Joe. Here's his number, by the way, just write this down. But just ask him because he's really on the money most of the time. I think Seton Hall is worthy to get in but you're all going to say well, he loves Kevin Willard like a son. I think Seton Hall is terrific and they've had a good year.

André van Lammeren, an associate professor of plant cell biology at the Netherlands' Wageningen University constructed what he calls a "preliminary experiment." He put 25 small ash trees in each of two small cabinets. He placed six wireless access points—similar to home routers—in one cabinet. Three months later, the trees closest to the routers exhibited leaf damage. How much, Dr. van Lammeren can't say; his team didn't precisely measure it.

A. With Sandy, she treated everyone on the set the same, whether it was the caterer or the other actors. She was the same person with everyone. It was so nice to see. And she stayed the same in the several times I've seen her since we made that movie. As for Julia, I noticed how aware she is of everything, not just the lines being said, but camera angles, shots, lighting, the way costumes fit in different situations and editing. The questions she asked were so calculated. She has learned so much through the years that she can anticipate problems in advance. It's really interesting to see how she uses the answers she gets to those questions to decide how to deliver her lines. It taught me to take notice of everything around me, and not just the lines being said by the actors.

Take the ahi tuna ($9.95), for example. This dish is another treasure from the ’80s (thought more so in Manhattan than in Jersey, at the time). Here it arrives with a combination of wasabi and seaweed salad, a lush, brilliant-colored tuna, dusted — surprise — in a 10-spice rub, giving it a bit of Cajun flair.
Cloud services are like a trendy new food ingredient or cooking technique that everybody's suddenly heard about. The industry knows that "all of your apps and data are available to you wherever you are and on every device you own" produces tasty stuff; now, they're allowing their imaginations to run with the idea and they're figuring out different ways that it can enhance different things. So it's like a circular-immersion circulator, only with bandwidth issues.

Lagos de Moreno, about 60 miles southeast of Guadalajara): On the site of an indigenous village called Pechtitán, this picturesque colonial city lies on the historic silver road between Zacatecas' mining camps and Mexico City. Today, it is an agricultural center and an important crossroads between Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Guadalajara. With more than 150,000 residents, it is Jalisco's sixth-largest city. The town's zócalo (main square) is surrounded by small restaurants and bars, most of which serve the fresh strawberries for which the region is known, swimming in cream. The town is full of plazas, gardens, colonial buildings and monuments; nearby lakes are popular for fishing and picnicking. A perfect place for tourists to relax and absorb Mexican history, yet few foreign tourists do.

The more deeply the Net is woven into our work lives and leisure activities, the more exposed we become. Over the last few years, as social-networking services have grown in popularity, people have come to entrust ever more intimate details about their lives to sites like Facebook and Twitter.

ø"Do you feel free?'' the bushy-beared Brown asked the crowd during the lead-in to tender love song Free As We'll Ever Be. That song, which included an interlude of Van Morrison's Into the Mystic, was an early emotional highlight. Equally captivating was a new song, The Day That I Die, from the band's album that's due out in July. Brown said the album will feature several guests, and he brought out one of them, Amos Lee, to help him sing the song, about contemplating mortality: "On the day that I die, I will say that I, was a man who really loved and never compromised.''

Haunted tale: Talk about type casting, the Rosson House's Gothic features are ever so alluring as a place that holds secrets from the past. Built in 1895 for a prominent doctor and his family, it operates today as a museum. Many a volunteer or visitor has come away with a slight shudder of wonder. There are stories of a ghost who lingers, stirring hearts with unexplained footsteps coming down the stairs, thought perhaps to be that of the former caretaker in the early 1980s who was shot and killed just outside the Victorian mansion. Camille Goulding, the Rosson House museum educator, said the ghost reports have died down over the years but have never really gone away. Docents have gotten locked out and have heard someone turning a key but no one was there. One day when Goulding was decorating the house for the Christmas holidays, she dropped something into the fireplace. "I felt something hot, but there wasn't a fire going,'' she said and chuckled. "It was weird." -- Connie Cone Sexton/The Arizona Republic

When an air traffic controller falls asleep on the job and gets suspended, it looks like human frailty. When that controller is working alone late at night and his nap causes two airliners to have to land without assistance, potentially endangering passengers and crew, that merits changed standards.

Faulk was emotional, yet composed; sincere and at times humorous. His eyes moistened and voice quavered at times; he wiped sweat from his brow with towel on a couple of occasions. But just like he did on the football field, Faulk never broke stride. His speech went 33 minutes, 50 seconds, outlasting his talkative predecessor on the stage, tight end Shannon Sharpe, who went 26 minutes. Faulk even outdid the last enshrinee to speak Saturday, the always-gabby cornerback, Deion Sanders, who went 24.

There have been quite a few instances in team sports over the past 24 months in which management should have stepped to a microphone and stated that the player or coach involved will no longer wear the uniform.

As a "consolation prize," however, it did correctly place Medford on the map display, even though it couldn't offer any flights there.

He's as tough-talking as Charles de Gaulle and, like the cantankerous general who ruled France four decades ago, Nicolas Sarkozy is determined to save France from its single biggest enemy: the French. And this is just the man who can pull it off. Currently minister of the interior under President Jacques Chirac, the 51-year-old Sarkozy is already considered the centrist UMP party's leading presidential candidate in April's French national elections. He is no favorite of incumbent Chirac (their relations are often as frosty as frozen foie gras). Yet while Chirac's popularity steadily plummets, Sarkozy's is on the rise. Here's why: Sarkozy comes bearing a tough-love message for his people that's long overdue: Arrogant France has fallen behind. Between lack of economic initiative, ravenous welfare costs and immigration woes, this once powerful nation has become a European sick man. If the country wants to drag itself out of those doldrums, Sarkozy says, it's going to have to stop resting on its aging laurels. It must radically reform its perverse handout economy - where people work only 35 hours a week - and start to puts its nose to the grindstone. What's more, in order to win the war on global terrorism, he insists, France has to join hands with its allies - not throw diplomatic tacks in their path. And how's this for a breath of fresh air? Unlike all other French leaders of the last 50 years, Sarkozy genuinely admires America and Americans. He made that loud and clear when he visited the U.

A few years ago, I wanted to have a home-equity line of credit. I did not need a loan, but I wanted to have access to funds with good terms.

There were no fees, even if I never accessed the account.
"When you're that balanced across the front row, it's tough to stop because you can't focus on one guy," CBC coach Jeff Cheak said. "Like I said, (Mehlville had) a very different offense, which is great in high school. I really give them a lot of credit. I think they're a great team."

Actually, I never book excursions. I should say I never book them now. When I took my dad, we met this guy, a really entertaining guy who was a private librarian. We noticed that every time we'd show up with a tour group, he would already be there. The tours all go to the same places. I just look at the brochures and take a taxi. I can stay longer if I want, and I don't have to wait around for others. And it's cheaper.

øA credit score is commonly based upon five categories: payment history, amount owed, length of credit history, pursuit of new credit, and the types of credit in use. Not all categories are weighted the same; however, all categories affect how your score is calculated. When you close an account, even one that is not in use, you are losing some of the credit available to you. This could increase your debt-to-credit ratio, which might hurt your score.

Problem was, their candidate was weak, defensive, unschooled and unskilled in dealing with the issue. Republicans have a year to cure that. If they can train their candidates to be just half as fluent as Ryan in defending their Medicare plan, they would be able to neutralize the issue.

On Sunday evening, I watched a guy who changed his name to "World Peace" lose his mind for no good reason and remind us that in another life and under another name he was the guy responsible for perhaps the ugliest incident in NBA history when in 2004 he started a brawl that spilled into the stands. I am mad at World Peace because he has to understand that no matter how well he has behaved in recent years to distance himself from that dark past (he won the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award last year for his work raising awareness of mental health issues and donating his entire 2012 salary to charities that benefit those issues), one idiotic moment like this wipes it all out.

We can no longer just tinker. We need to ask whether government spending serves genuine public purposes or merely benefits favored constituencies. Delay in acting has already eliminated a long grace period to prepare for reduced retirement benefits or to wind down useless programs. Now, we are condemned to be unfair. If we don't cut spending, the young may complain (correctly) that they're burdened with crushing tax increases; if we do cut spending, beneficiaries may complain (correctly) that they didn't receive ample warning.

The player in early position had about $35,000. He contemplated my move-in and then placed the necessary chips in the pot, and the player who originally raised decided to fold. I thought I'd been trapped and was near-dead to a huge hand, but my opponent flipped up a mere pair of sixes! Not only would his hand often be worse than mine, but sometimes the player in late position would move in, too, and the player in early position would be in bad shape. At best, his sixes were going to be in a coin flip, which was the case this time. But the board ran out without any of my necessary face cards, and I was eliminated.

Mormons believe, like other Christians, each human being is imperfect but capable, through faith and good deeds, of improving -- and is fact responsible to his creator to try. They teach hard work, thrift, respect for human life, and tolerance for the beliefs of others.
