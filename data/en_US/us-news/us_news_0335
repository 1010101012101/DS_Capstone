Finally, our sister paper in Chicago, never one to pass up an opportunity to point out why the Windy City is the center of the known universe, takes a wistful look at Hugh Hefner's Playboy empire following last week's closure of the Chicago offices of Playboy Enterprises (Hefner has moved the corporate headquarters to Los Angeles, a reversal of the usual trend in which L.A.'s biggest companies tend to be bought up and closed by bigger companies based in places like Chicago). "The Playboy era seems kind of quaint now," the editorial page concludes. "Hefner looks a little quixotic at his age, cavorting with young women. But in his day, he threw a helluva party. In Chicago." OK, we get it: L.A. gets the surviving wheeze of a once-great empire whose heyday passed long ago. Chicago is a truly great place, which might be a little greater if it could get over its insecure Second City complex.

Howard averaged 25.8 points and 13 rebounds against Cleveland, having his way against a team with virtually no post presence. That won't be the case against the Lakers, who have 7-footers Andrew Bynum and Gasol. Howard, who averaged 5.3 fouls against Cleveland, must avoid committing cheap fouls. And Bynum and Gasol will try to score in the post, something Cleveland's Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Anderson Varejao did not do effectively.

So, in this case, the statute of limitations would not run out until 2013. No civil suit had been filed.

The United States promises to seek annual funding to train and equip the Afghan armed forces but gives no dollar figure.

They care about one another. There is a bond of love based on common faith that makes them very close. . . .

The article "Ethics classes for Secret Service" (May 1) leaves one astonished and livid. I'm sure that the great majority of Secret Service employees don't need training in ethical behavior, having had ethical parents, educators, relatives and close friends from birth until they were hired by the Secret Service. If as adults they have not digested what ethical behavior is all about, we should examine the hiring process carefully in our assessment of what to do about the problem, not just send them to Johns Hopkins ethics classes.
1 As with most things in life, greater participation in elections almost always leads to better decisions. The greater the turnout, the less influence the establishment wields. The more people vote, the less weight those on the far edges of the political spectrum have. Although there is nothing wrong with being on those far edges, either on the left or the right, the best answers are usually somewhere in the middle. Many of the problems in government these days stem from voters who, through action or apathy, send representatives to Congress who are unwilling to act like adults. Change that by voting.

Now they’re steadily driving out the terrorists from the provinces east of Kabul, and back across the border into Pakistan. In 2012, the Taliban will try to regain that lost ground. If we beat them then, they’ll almost certainly have lost Afghanistan for good.

As for the park itself, the most recent tweaks seemed to have worked. As for what's next, a couple of sources told me there's some interest in opening the concourse to the playing field so that you'd always be able to see the field. That's how many of the newer stadiums are set up, and it would address one of Camden Yards' few weaknesses; being in the concourse often feels too separated from the crowd. But that's going to be a very expensive project.

When it comes to protecting children and keeping them safe, every adult and individual in our community has a moral obligation to act. Children who are loving and trusting by nature can never be victimized by troubled individuals who want to cause harm to them.

Since then, however, things have gone badly for the Dems. In 2010 they lost both houses of the North Carolina General Assembly, and one incumbent representative fell to a Republican.

Virginia Commonwealth over Wichita State.Wichita State may have finished the regular season as the nation's best midmajor, but VCU is starting to look like VCU again.

A wholesale return to the wholesome drama of "The Waltons" and "Little House on the Prairie" is not remotely likely. But plenty of quirky and edgy network dramas, from "Northern Exposure" and "The West Wing" to "Lost," managed to maintain a sense of hope and optimism. Isn't it time for the pendulum to start swinging the other way? Wouldn't a savvy writer-producer be looking to zig when everyone else was zagging?

They wonder if the same fans that made the old stadium memorable will fill New Meadowlands Stadium. Testa said tonight's crowd will be filled only with the fans who could afford to purchase tickets.

Holliday's double scored Rafael Furcal from first base -- but not before there was the possibility of a play at the plate.

Extra points: Smith said first-round draft pick Shea McClellin will not play any linebacker. … Asked about the Bears making more risk/reward selections than they did under Jerry Angelo, Smith walked a fine line. "There's risks in every player that you look at, but you weigh that. We checked out everybody that we brought in. We all felt comfortable with that." … The Bears have 72 players on the roster and can carry 90.

The week-after-week format of television admittedly builds a depth of character study richer and deeper than most movies are capable of. But would you watch a 13- or 22-hour movie? Huge swathes of recent episodes of "Mad Men" would hit the cutting-room floor in even the most luxuriously paced movie, as the amount of wheel-spinning and narrative churning that can go into a television show would never pass with cinemagoers. Face it, the recent "Fat Betty" story line would definitely be trimmed from "Mad Men: The Movie."

Another was friendliness personified, but seemed to view her role as more supporting player than leading lady, that's how little face time we actually received. A third was blandly efficient and little else. "Given these prices, shouldn't we expect more than someone phoning it in?" asked my friend. In a word, yes.

They looked like they all had been up all night and couldn't care less about the game. Where is the team leader to get these guys excited about playing? Yell, scream, do what it takes to light a fire under them. So, my analysis is that the team needs a player like Ray Lewis to give this team a jump-start. -- David Isaac, Fair Oaks, Calif.

What the Blazers can not do is allow Stoudemire to distract them from the task at hand. That would be winning two more games, and controlling the paint, and dodging the elbows that he throws adjusting his goggles and such.

Clearly, Gov. Chris Christie is right to say that Bill Brown, a law student and former Navy SEAL, was rude when he interrupted the governor several times during a news conference last Thursday. But Mr. Brown’s rudeness is no excuse for the governor’s own rudeness and name-calling (“Christie: No regrets on calling vet ‘idiot,’ ” March 13).

The older photos also remind us that for the people of 1906, time didn't stop: There was too much to do. That Shreve picture from 1906 has piles of neatly stacked bricks in the foreground: surviving bits of masonry ready to be pressed into action as the city rebuilt.

• Are the Miami Heat what the New York Knicks were supposed to be? The Journal's Jason Gay thinks so: "This series is supposed to be the other way around, was it not? Looking back, New York was so presumptuous about its expected coup: LeBron James was coming to the Knicks and an NBA title would soon follow. He'd attract the extra pieces—maybe even his friend Dwyane Wade would join up, if New York could squeeze some extra cap room. Yes, it sounds crazy here, in 2012, just before the Knicks' opening-round playoff series against Miami. But these possibilities were actually talked about a few years ago. Wacky times, they were. Everyone was into slider burgers, Auto-Tune and that big-boned mall cop, Paul Blart."

Thistledown officials have been checking sites around Ohio where another race track might be built, with the Akron-Canton region the most rumored destination.

Ellis learned the importance of turning over the lineup with two out — reaching base to ensure the pitcher wouldn't lead off the next inning. He also learned to expand his strike zone with runners in scoring position, knowing the pitcher batting behind him was unlikely to drive in the runner.
So does Whedon, though I surely do wish someone other than Alan Silvestri had composed the music; this stuff is so generic, the movie would actually be better off with no music and someone in voiceover merely saying "And here we'll have some stirring triumphal nonsense like the stuff you heard three scenes ago." Little matter, at least to the box office. Whedon's both a wiseacre - Stark at one point refers to Thor as "Point Break," referencing his Patrick Swayze surfer locks - and a sincere devotee of Marvel's durable, malleable ensemble of lugs and indestructibles, introduced as a group in 1963.

To her, the idea of shared appointments made sense: Because once the ultrafine needles are placed into the skin, there's a long period where the patient just rests -- perhaps 45 minutes -- with occasional check-ins by the therapist.
Consider the narrative. A mentally ill man living just this side of homelessness stumbled down a sidewalk in the Pearl District, that nationally renowned symbol of urban renewal. Police were too far removed from community policing to recognize him as the neighborhood schizophrenic, not a junkie. Thinking he had just urinated in the street, they ordered him to stop. He ran. They chased. With well-heeled diners looking on from Bluehour, one of Portland's toniest restaurants, the officers tackled, Tasered and kicked Chasse. He died in the back of a police car from injuries that included 26 breaks to 16 ribs and a punctured lung.

Cool ambiance and all, Zefiro is a real restaurant, serious about the wine and food it purveys.

Beyond this, menus are influenced by what's fresh at the local market.

Craig Brewer's "Black Snake Moan" is nothing if not ripe. And provocative, at least until you see it. A black man stands menacingly over a white girl in the publicity stills; he's holding one end of a massive chain that encircles her waist. But you can't judge a potboiler by its lid. Yes, Christina Ricci's Rae is the town whore, and a nymphomaniac whose spasms of desire announce themselves with twitchy music and amazing gyrations. And yes, Samuel L. Jackson's Lazarus has his bitter side; a former bluesman, he's got the blues since his young wife left him. But when the church-going Laz tells the bed-going Rae "I'm gonna cure you of your wickedness," you'd better believe that the emphasis is on a cure.

"I had been struggling for a film idea. All the ideas I had were tough to shoot, with many locations.
