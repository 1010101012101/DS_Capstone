But there's a catch: Adams expected the ramp to someday accommodate a streetcar line traveling across the bridge. Eliminating the ramp means the proposed streetcar to Lake Oswego would need to travel through the westside intersection, not under it. Currently, there is no proposal to take the line over the Willamette, but making the bridge streetcar-ready is something Adams has linked to the city's $100 million contribution.

45: Bennett’s career pass attempts. The bulk of Bennett’s action has come against Nevada, Missouri State, Colorado and Washington State. CU and WSU rank in the bottom third of the Pac-12 in total defense. Missouri State is a 1-8 FCS program. Nevada ranks 64th in the nation in total defense. Against that level of competition he has provided just 45 samples of his passing skills, not nearly enough to go by to determine that he is better than Thomas. But it has been enough to show that he is not as good as Thomas.

The plot is your basic bad-guy-wants-to-take-over-the-world kind of thing. The preening, effete Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the bitter brother of hunky demigod Thor (Chris Hemsworth), descends to Earth from Asgard, which still has a distinctly '70s cheesiness about its twinkly sci-fi aesthetic. Once here, he steals the Tesseract, the cosmic blue cube that gives its bearer unlimited power, or some such thing.
This year the college majors delivering the best job prospects are accounting, business administration, computer science, engineering and mathematics, said Koc of the Association of Colleges and Employers.

The good news is that the Capitals, who have lost three of their past six games after a nine-game winning streak, have five games to get healthy and back in the groove. If that happens, they are poised to go on a nice playoff run, one that shouldn't end with a disappointing first-round exit like a year ago.
"I like creating plays," she said. "I would prefer to get someone else open and make that pass, because I think it takes a little bit more skill to feed it in at the right time right when that person's open, even before she knows she's open. That's one of my favorite parts of the game."

Kentucky eventually got going behind star sophomore forward Terrence Jones, who had nine first-half points, and the game went to the half knotted at 28.

Lower property values, the result of the housing bubble crash, are now being registered in tax valuations. Millions were lost as the banks trampled the law while dodging recording and transfer fees on mortgages. Unemployment and poverty put greater pressure on budgets, particularly on health care through Medicaid. The losses suffered by pension funds force higher payments by public employers. The high unemployment economy generates lower sales and income tax revenues.

Tebowmania hit the Big Apple even before the ink was dry on the trade last week that brought him to New York as a backup to shaky incumbent Mark Sanchez. Of course, it took several hours for the deal to be consummated because of a clause in the contract as tricky as driving through midtown Manhattan in rush hour.
Bob Martin, acting commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the policy cannot be fully adopted until a series of public hearings is held. If the management plan does win final approval, Martin said, he will make the ultimate decision on whether a hunt goes on.

Like we said Monday in our "68 Things to Know For Filling Out Your Bracket," it's going to be tough for the Hoosiers to win without injured PG Verdell Jones III, who tore his ACL in the Big Ten Tournament. But that's not why they'll lose. It's the Aggies' ability to get to the free-throw line. Marvin Menzies' team has taken over 1,000 free throws this season. Physicality and getting to the line is how they'll pull the upset. New Mexico State, 74-67.

McMillan said he is concerned with what appears to be second-half stiffness in Roy, Andre Miller and Marcus Camby. The time it takes the three key players to loosen up has often come at the expense of leads, and has certainly led to long stretches of ineffective offense.
One of their objections, that the bill would alter the playing field for this year's midterm elections, is now irrelevant since it's too late to change the law for the campaign leading up to November's contests.

McCarthy said many of the booming Ohio manufacturers can trace some of their success to what Caterpillar is experiencing. Each mining truck sold by Caterpillar could include transmission equipment from Eaton, hydraulics from Parker Hannifin and steel and bearings from Timken.

The Williams Institute, a UCLA think tank that specializes in sexual-orientation and gender-identity law, estimates that more than 9,000 same-sex couples who already live in Washington will marry in the first three years following the bill's enactment. This could inject $88 million into the economy, the institute says.
The coach's new contract extension in February 2007 included no such terms, even as his compensation substantially increased. It wasn't until six months later that the university signed a side agreement with Schiano that added $250,000 a year to his income by having Nelligan pay him as a consultant. The university guaranteed the money even if those funds did not materialize.

"I know I have power. I know I can hit the ball from corner to corner," Pujols said last week in Anaheim. "I know all that, but I'm not going to think about getting caught up and saying, `Man, I haven't hit a home run.' ... I have, what, 445 (career home runs) for a reason."
"We had just a phenomenal day," said Angela Fang, general manager for the race. "Everybody is saying they had a great time."
Leon remembers the boom years, but older Spaniards' memories go back further. Thirty years ago, Spain was still a poor country compared with the nations of Northern Europe. It had just emerged from nearly 40 years of military dictatorship, with a closed economy, and wages were much lower than today's.
Bisimwa said this latest offensive did not constitute a violation of the rebels' unilateral cease-fire. "We said this cease-fire involved only us and this government army," he said.

In a letter on his website, Stacey said Roberts called him after making a surprise, last-minute filing for the position on Feb. 9. Roberts told him several councilors requested she apply for the District 6 vacancy because none of the applicants could get a majority of the council's support. They asked Roberts to apply in order to break the logjam, Stacey reported. Roberts, 74, has confirmed that chain of events; neither has identified the councilors who urged her to apply.

The public continues to debate whether Citizens United is responsible for the rise and influence of Super PACs, heavily funded political action committees that have flooded airwaves with ads in the Republican presidential primaries. Though some scholars claim that other laws in addition to Citizens United have enabled the Super PAC phenomenon, Clements says the Supreme Court decision was a tipping point.

The funding cut was much steeper than anticipated, said Frank E. Lawatsch Jr., the library board’s president. The trustees had expected the library would lose $400,000 as recently as a few weeks ago, he said. But since the vast majority of the library’s budget – 94 percent in 2010 and 92 percent this year – comes from the town, Lawatsch said the board had few options, all of them difficult.

About 30 seconds was all it took for me to see I wouldn't be making any substantive contribution. My job was to try and keep up, to attempt to synchronize and at least not arrest our motion with a poorly-timed catch.

Truth: Do not prune a tree after planting except its dead or broken branches. There are those who think the roots of plants, especially trees, are very deep and mirror the aboveground portions of the tree in size, depth and breadth. With the exception of tap-rooted plants, roots that actively absorb and transport water and nutrients primarily expand out in a shallow shelf beyond the drip line.

Joe Paterno, who coached Penn State to 409 victories from 1966-2011, will be posthumously honored with the 2012 Dick Enberg Award, presented by the College Sports Information Directors of America. Paterno was voted to receive the award in March 2011, but was unable to accept it in person. He was planning to appear at this year's event in St. Louis before he died in January after a brief battle with lung cancer. His son, Jay, will accept on behalf of the family. Paterno was fired last November in the wake of a sexual-assault scandal allegedly involving a former assistant coach. The award goes to those who are passionate and committed to academics and athletics. Past winners include Tom Osborne, Bill Russell, Dean Smith and Pat Summitt.

Lately, he has taken that sense of order to a new extreme: He has two Blackberries, because he needed to uncouple his professional and private lives. When he left American Express more than a year ago, he didn’t even have a personal email address. Now, his life is in two separate — and tidy ... no, very tidy — piles, because “while I’m not a neat freak, I am neat,” he says.

For tracks such as Arlington to make money, Duchossois said, people need to wager on site because the track gets a bigger return. If people win, there is a better chance they will stay at the track and bet more money.
In fact, the "socialist" Obama has presided over an economy in which private employment has risen by 4.2 million jobs during the recovery even as governments at all levels have cut public payrolls by some 600,000 since the beginning of 2009. If shrinking government is the political right's goal, this puts Obama to the right of both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The United States should have been even more aggressive in pump-priming the economy, and Obama would have been if conservatives and some moderates had not been so resistant.

Tassy Morgan has left the big city for a ramshackle house on the northern coast of California. Recovering from a difficult divorce, she paints landscapes for tourists visiting the small town of San Andreas. Her beach shack is falling down around her ears. The bluff itself is crumbling beneath it. San Andreas is gentrifying, though, and the community declares Tassy's property is historic, which means she can't just demolish the shack and be done with it. Lincoln Ellis, another new arrival to San Andreas, is both a widower and an attorney for the town. It doesn't take long for the two of them to become attracted to each other, but that doesn't mean Tassy's problems are solved. Old wounds and construction obstacles aren't entirely easy to overcome. Frothy as a root beer float, "Tassy Morgan's Bluff" is author Jim Stinson's debut novel. Stinson splits his time between California and Oregon.

Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, for example, brought in $1.89 million in ticket sales. But the Greatest Show on Earth was attended by an average of only 4,438 people over 18 shows in March of last year. The sports authority also made far less on concessions income because the circus is permitted to sell its own Sno-Cones, cotton candy and other sweets. The authority’s share of concessions revenues during the circus run was just $3,556 per show.

Other books have touched on the 1992 riots; you can find a bibliography on the Internet. Most are academic or legal, but some are more than that: William T. Vollmann's "The Atlas," which features a brief essay about driving into L.A. on the night the fires erupted, or Michael Connelly's novel "The Concrete Blonde," in which a serial killer's victim is found beneath the ruins of a building that was burned. Even there, however, the riots exist on the periphery, as backdrop rather than centerpiece.

"We would get locked in," he explained. "We were chitlins, and they wanted chitlins under glass. They wanted us to put in show tunes. The people from the Midwest didn't know 'Back Stabbers' or 'Love Train,' so we were told to put in songs like 'My Way' and 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco.' If we'd put those songs in our shows in, say, Augusta, Ga., they'd throw rocks at us.
The Browns have showed some promise this preseason, and in McCoy it looks like they've found a young quarterback whose whole is greater than the sum of his parts. Cleveland will take a step forward in Pat Shurmur's first year as head coach, and it doesn't hurt that the mild, mild NFC West is on a schedule that falls into the less-than-challenging category. But the Browns have too many issues to overcome to climb into contention in the division this season, and the lockout hurt them as much as anyone, given all the transitions underway this year in Cleveland.

Dozens of cities in California and across the country have done this. The County of San Diego, widely considered to be one of the most fiscally conservative and financially sound counties in the State, has bonded its pension system three times for a total of $1.4 billion over the past several years. Using bonds, the county has refinanced their pension debt at lower rates, amortized that debt over 30 years, and in the process has injected more money into their pension system and saved taxpayers money. Similar bonds have been used in our city for Petco Park, the Convention Center, water pipes, and fire stations.

Matt Bracken: The only basketball program I watch more than Maryland is Michigan. I was born and raised (by two Michigan alums) in The Mitten and graduated from U-M in 2005. So over the past two years, I've probably seen 90 percent of Smotrycz's games with the Wolverines. I think we can all admit that diehard college sports fans are notoriously fickle, so the reaction to Smotrycz's depature from a Michigan perspective was decidedly mixed. Some said good riddance and claimed he'd be passed by players in a Top 10 incoming class. Some said it was a significant loss and he would've played a bigger role for the Wolverines going forward. Count me among those in the latter camp. Without question, Smotrycz needs to get tougher defensively and continue improving as a rebonder (although 4.4 per game in 21 minutes isn't too shabby). But he's a talented offensive player and an excellent 3-point shooter. He's also probably a better fit in the ACC than the rugged, frustratingly-football-esque Big 10. In fact, the breakout game of Smotrycz's Michigan career was against Clemson in the 2010 ACC/Big 10 Challenge. The future Terp scored 18 points on 6-for-7 shooting, helping the Wolverines to a 69-61 road win. Maryland's influx of front-court players over the next two seasons makes it hard to predict exactly what role Smotrycz will play, but I see no reason why he can't be a double-digit scorer for the Terps that's more than capable of the occasional 20-point outburst. The Terps got a good one here.

Only three dishes even border on deserving criticism, and the problem was not in the flavoring but in the final execution. The fried chicken breast ($18) with buttermilk mashed potatoes and collard greens was a little dry, as was the maple brined pork chop ($23), though I loved the accompanying drunken apples, Dijon mustard sauce and Yukon gold and Brussels sprouts hash. The Tipsy burger ($12) was cooked more medium well than medium rare, but the meat was still juicy. The burger is also well priced, considering it also includes white Cheddar cheese and caramelized onions on a pain de mie bun, and fries.

According to NASA astronomers, the Earth and sun are aligned with the center of the Milky Way every December, with no discernible trouble. NASA has also been quick to dismiss the other 2012 disaster scenarios, saying the planet Nibiru doesn't exist, and therefore cannot strike the Earth; that the north and south poles do, in fact, switch polarity every 400,000 years or so, but that this poses no particular danger and isn't expected any time soon; and that warnings of the effects of a solar storm are vastly exaggerated.
