4. Very interesting that two teams from Ohio (Cincinnati and Ohio) and two teams from Florida (South Florida-Florida State) are playing in Nashville, even though both states are known as "football states." Ohio has dominated AAU basketball age-group championships two of the past three summers. All four teams (OU, UC, USF, FSU) have players on their rosters from Florida.
Two years later, DeSmet is a healthy and active 60-year-old with a message for other women: "Take care of yourself. If you suspect something is wrong, check it out. We always blow it off, like I did.

"This has to be attributed to (Bersin)," said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., that studies immigration. "He has been the person who has been in charge. The same way we would blame Alan Bersin if we hadn't made enough progress, fair or unfair, we have to give credit to Alan Bersin for whatever gains we have made at the border."

This is not a shot at Cuban, a bright businessman and one of the game's best owners. He is certainly on point in criticizing the one-and-done canon, developed in 2005 as a way to keep NBA scouts out of high school gyms and save general managers from themselves.

The Blues' top line of David Backes, T.J. Oshie and David Perron has been responsible for defending Thornton's line in the series, and they have received much credit for the job they've done. But for Backes and Oshie, whose only three points of the series came in Game 2, some are wondering if they could be providing more offense and still do a solid job checking the Sharks.
But the path we've taken, regrettably, goes through an expensive, political minefield. If GM emerges from bankruptcy organized and governed by the plan created by the Obama administration, it is impossible to see how free markets will have anything to do with the U.S. auto industry henceforth. With taxpayers on the hook for $50 billion (at a minimum), the administration will do whatever it has to -- including tilting the playing field with policies that induce consumers to buy GM, hamstring GM's competition or subsidize its costs -- for GM to succeed. Thus, $50 billion is a sum that is more likely to grow larger than it is to be repaid. It is also a sum that will serve as the rationalization for further government interventions on GM's behalf.

The lease says the dome, "taken as a whole," and each of 15 separate components, must be first-tier. If the 15 components are first-tier, does that mean the whole is first-tier? Or is the whole separate from the components? We suspect entire squadrons of lawyers will wind up arguing that issue.

If the president does propose a jobs bill early next year, it's likely to consist of modest tax incentives designed to spur private-sector hiring. One idea being discussed is a broad tax credit for any business that expands its payroll. That could get expensive, because it would reward employers that were planning to hire anyway.

Maltais: I actually noticed the weight difference immediately when Nate brought the iPad to my desk. Then again, I'm acutely attuned to the tiny fluctuations when my infant eats. As someone who deals with wrists that throb from repetitive stress injury, this gave me a little pause -- not enough to not get or use the new iPad, but enough to think about how to adjust iPad usage. It's a small sacrifice of wrist strength for the sake of improvements.

The effects are, of course, top-notch. Plenty of buildings get destroyed in proper superhero-film fashion. But that's not what you're likely to remember when you leave "The Avengers." More likely you'll keep replaying the dialogue in your head, the back-and-forth between the characters. Ultimately that's what makes this hero movie truly super.
But be warned: Competition for those dollars is also up, in part because of the economic downturn. In the past academic year, 19.5 million families submitted applications for federal financial aid, a 33 percent increase from just two years earlier, Kantrowitz says. More families seeking federal aid likely means a greater number will be applying for private scholarships, too.
Moscoso, acquired from the A's in January in the deal that sent outfielder Seth Smith to Oakland, threw 40 of 83 pitches for balls in 4 1/3 innings. In his Rockies debut against the Mets on April 28, Moscoso threw 40 of 100 pitches for balls in five innings as he gave up nine hits and six runs during a 7-5 loss. In that game, the Rockies gave him a 1-0 lead in the first and then scored three runs in the fourth to go ahead 4-3, but Moscoso gave up three runs in the fifth on four consecutive two-out hits.
I understand that political cartoons are supposed to be satire, but in order to be intellectually honest, this satire should at least be based in some semblance of truth. The implication of the April 30 anti-Catholic cartoon is that because Jesus did not "speak out" against homosexual acts, the pope is wrong in doing so.
Originally billed as an effort to find and deport illegal immigrants who are dangerous criminals, Secure Communities sounded like a law-enforcement tool. The idea was to run the fingerprints of everyone booked into jail through federal immigration databases and find the bad guys.

It's spiritual. It's churches choosing to spend more on ministry and on creating community than on multimillion-dollar edifices and over-the-top pastoral salaries. It's returning to the faith of our fathers. It's so-called black leaders either stepping up or stepping out of the way.

øFrom that preservation, they know the Stone Age farmers at the site ate a diet heavy in barley and wheat with little meat or fish. Although a full reconstruction of the region's prehistoric climate awaits, they know from plant remains that it was wetter and more forested in ancient times. And analyses of the burial skeletons show people who were not much different physically from those in the Mediterranean today, almost as tall as tall as Greeks today, although they were slightly anemic due to a lack of meat in their diet.

John Gorham hit the ball really hard with his tweaked-but-faithful Spanish menu at Toro Bravo. But this American-with-several-twists spot may be even better, showcasing a huge variety of flavors and techniques and a rambunctious playfulness that elicits smiles along with the groans of satisfied appetites. Take the cast-iron cassoulet, which turns the hearty southern French classic into a cowboy meal of baked beans and grilled meats (including a sausage that's very like, yes, a frankfurter). The brunch menu is flush with clever, filling dishes; the fish, meat and cheese plates are diverse and intense; and the chocolate potato doughnuts -- sold by the piece -- make a heavenly fare-thee-well.

Attempts to sabotage aircraft also declined, he added.
Sometimes a mom's cooking - for better or worse - is the reason a person becomes a chef. Bissonnette realized early that if he wanted to eat well, he'd have to cook for himself, he says, and he credits his mom "a thousand percent" with inspiring him, however dubiously, to his profession. In contrast, Jacqueline Winch, mom to "Ace of Cakes" Duff Goldman, was a skilled and adventurous cook, her son says, and her beef fondue is the dish that made him a chef.

Last time Dulce Ben-East and her husband, Michael East, checked, for every six million gallons of maple syrup produced, a mere 3,000 of the birch alternative gets made. Settled in Alaska where they're one of only two manufacturers of this rare commodity, the duo has been at it for 23 seasons. It's precious cargo: More than 100 gallons of sap are required to yield just one of syrup. We've discovered that the couple's Kahiltna Birchworks "Gold Pure" organic elixir is tops. Possessing a cola-like flavor, it quirks out with spicy, caramel-esque, woody and smoky nuances. Power chefs like Charlie Trotter are already hip to its majesty, and a few breweries have begun bringing it on board (like the Alaskan Brewing Co.'s Birch Bock Ale). The Kahiltna team puts it into their almond toffee and birch-orange mustard. Don't waste it on pancakes. Apply it as a marinade or glaze to meat or fish (with soy sauce, sesame, ginger, garlic and basil) or pour it over ice cream.

MUMBAI—Honeywell International Inc.'s chairman said India's labyrinthine bureaucracy and aggressive regulation and tax policies are vexing foreign investors and will divert investment to China and elsewhere.
Economists doubt consumers can keep spending as freely as they did in the first three months of this year: an annual pace that was 2.9 percent faster than in the previous quarter and the fastest in more than a year. They probably can't afford to. Americans' after-tax income rose just 0.6 percent in the first three months, compared with a year earlier. That was the puniest pay increase in two years.
That’s why I plan to bury my survival kit of wine and cigars on the Senior Center grounds. If we are to survive in it, life must continue to be a pleasure. At least my friends and I will be able to huddle in comfort while waiting for help to arrive.
• Former Knicks and Nets favorite Michael Ray Richardson spoke to Harvey Araton of The New York Times at the Prudential Center on Monday night and gave his own unique take on New York's current situation: "Micheal Ray Richardson made a ceremonial appearance at Prudential Center on Monday night to help bring the curtain down on the New Jersey Nets, but he took the opportunity to offer good news on the state of another former team, as only he could... 'It’s floatin’,' Richardson said of the Knicks, playing off his widely quoted 'ship be sinkin’ assessment of them during the 1981-82 season... Richardson likes the Knicks’ chances of pulling an upset in the first round of the N.B.A. playoffs next weekend — in all likelihood against the Miami Heat. He thinks Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire will do whatever it takes to co-exist in the flow of the Knicks’ offense."

McHenry denied that he held any animosity to Grant. "Every generation needs its own heroes," he said. "One decade into the 21st century, it's time to honor the last great president of the 20th and give President Reagan a place beside Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy." Franklin D. Roosevelt's image is on the dime and John F. Kennedy's is on the half-dollar.

At the news conference, Staton also expressed frustration at some of the 3,000-plus tips that have been called in to investigators. Vague tips such as to check "a wooded area" take investigator's time to listen to and catalog. He added that criticism at the pace of the investigation also has been disheartening, adding that detectives don't want to jeopardize the investigation by sharing information with the public.
The Maloofs made a strong point in their letter Wednesday to say that the preliminary term sheet is non-binding, with their attorney writing, "there was never an agreement reached."
Will Reiser actually was seeing a therapist, but I think she was about 55. In the film, she was fictional anyway, so that was kind of great. I was talking at a Q&A recently and Will spoke to me afterwards and said, “I had no idea that’s what Katherine was thinking during that scene.” That was sort of exciting for him because I played one of the characters who wasn’t from his real life.
Longtime spectators and parking crews struggled to navigate the newly numbered parking lots.

Debbie Dye-Joyce, licensing supervisor for the Ohio Department of Commerce, said that everything with mortgage regulation is evolving. Besides the licensing required by the state, there is now the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System, launched in 2008, aimed at every loan officer, regardless of whether they work for a traditional bank or other kind of mortgage operation. Registration with the NMLS became mandatory in Ohio in 2010.

The city's talking much tougher this week about collecting from people who simply refuse to pay those pesky click-it-and-ticket fees. There's a big list of potential targets out there, too: Cleveland recently hired a pair of collection companies to track down nearly $9.7 million in overdue fines. That represents about 60,000 unpaid tickets.
Kaine Horman left their rural Northwest Portland home immediately, but has since forced his estranged wife out of the home.
In his darkest hour, Jean said any thoughts of giving up his charitable efforts were squelched by words from his father: "God only gives you what he knows you can handle." That and a little history lesson of his own.
The unions would like you to believe they advocate in the best interest of the worker, but they also enjoy the money they syphon from each workers' paycheck. They squander funds on lawyers, lawsuits and political pay backs without input or approval from the members obligated to contribute.
Not only did the Kings send the Vancouver Canucks out in five games for their first playoff series win in 11 years but they also buried recent postseason failures and years of mediocrity.
Yes, he expressed concern about bloodshed in Syria and Afghanistan. But he cited more reasons for hope. He gave a shout-out to Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy activist in Myanmar who this week won permission to travel outside her country: "I really admire that lady," He praised the innovative spirit of the United States, the religious tolerance of his adopted country, India, and the promise of the 21st century.
"The administration seems to think that if they drag this out, we will give up and simply go away. But we won't," Stearns said.
The amounts involved weren’t huge. But in two instances, the tickets were months overdue and in judgment. It didn’t take long for each legislator to pay up when contacted by The Post.

In 2010, Sisto wrapped up a three-year run on "Law & Order." The "monotony" of working on that legal drama led him to channel his creative juices into making music. His debut album, "Escape Tailor," drops this spring. (His father, Chicago native Dick Sisto, is a jazz musician who's played many a gig on the South Side.)
"The global cruise industry is now looking toward Asia as a major growth engine," says Lanie Fagan, director of communications for Florida-based Cruise Lines International Assn. The association sees Southeast Asia as one of 2011's hot destinations. About 2 million cruise passengers passed through Hong Kong in 2010, and a record-breaking 1.14 million in Singapore, which is building an almost seven-acre deepwater cruise terminal expected to be completed by late 2012.
When Munch created the first version of the "The Scream," the alcoholic and chain-smoking artist was in a state of despair: He was turning 30, had no money, was reeling from a disastrous love affair and was terrified that he would succumb to the mental illness that ran in his family, says Munch scholar Sue Prideaux. The artist placed his amoeba-like figure at a popular suicide spot on Oslo's U-shaped bay where passersby could hear screams from a nearby slaughterhouse and insane asylum, Ms. Prideaux says, adding that Munch's sister, diagnosed with schizophrenia, was housed in that asylum. One possible misperception about the work is the scream itself: many art historians say the character is not howling, but blocking out the sound of screams around him.
Excuse me. Where else but in movies does a gun shot kick up debris? That high-powered bullet slams into the ground and is gone and seldom leaves a trace. Also do people understand that a little dust in its face won't cause it to go away? A bear will plow its face into a bee hive to get the honey and a thousand stings will never deter it. They will also pull up a four-foot tree stump (with one heave) to get at grubs and stuff.
There's a tiny sushi bar with three kinds of fish, but they looked dried out, so I avoided ordering sushi until my last visit, when the contents of the case looked fresher. The Hawaiian big-eye tuna ($6), quickly seared with the Japanese spice sancho, was served on a restrained pad of rice, topped with crispy shallots. It was quite good. Although the fish was obliterated in another specialty, the spicy tuna and water chestnut maki ($13), the roll itself had a boisterous flavor.
LaQueshia Jackson is on the witness list for the retrial, but prosecutors indicated on Tuesday that she would not be called. But they did indicate a plan to present other eyewitnesses.
Last Monday, Ferraro said of the possible sale to the Cavaliers: "It's mutual interest, and I think it's a natural fit for them. The Gladiators play in their building, and we sell our tickets at their box office. They have a structure in place, with the Cavaliers and the Monsters. If it happens, it will be better for the Gladiators, better for the fans."

“I can learn a lot from this guy,” Batum said at the morning shootaround. “He’s one of the best small forwards in the league. He was all-defensive team last year, one of the best rebounders in the league, especially at our position. So I can learn a lot from him. He’s tough, plays with energy, strong. He can be like a model for me.”
øPatrick had a hot-and-cold performance at the season's first restrictor-plate race at Daytona International Speedway.

Last week, Democrats said they did not receive all the documents they requested from the governor’s office and threatened to use subpoenas to force the administration to provide them. They canceled a vote Monday to give a Senate committee subpoena power after Sweeney met with the governor.
The first witness to take the stand was Pierce County Sheriff's Detective Gary Sanders, who described how investigators found the images and then displayed them for jurors, explaining what they were seeing in each one. The screen on which the images were displayed was turned to avoid showing them to spectators in the courtroom, but Sanders' testimony sounded like a creepy slide show.

The idea was that penitentiaries would heal the criminally ill just as hospitals cured the physically sick. It didn't work. Yet despite -- or perhaps because of -- the failures of the first prisons, states authorized more and larger prisons. With flogging banned and crime not cured, there was simply no alternative. We tried rehabilitation and ended up with supermax. We tried to be humane and ended up with more prisoners than Stalin had at the height of the Soviet Gulag. Somewhere in the process, we lost the concept of justice and punishment in a free society.
I wonder what impact being the lead investigator on a serial killer case has on family. Wyatt allows he's working 75-hour weeks and it's tough on his 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter. But, he professes, his court reporter wife understands, even brings in food for the men and women on the task force.
In which case, owning the Los Angeles Dodgers and the St. Louis Rams would violate cross-ownership rules.
"We don't need to change too much," Spencer said. "I think we did enough to win the game, but we didn't, so the main concern for us is stay focused.

Teddy, as those who've been following along this season know, is on a roll. Though he got off to a rocky start, his picks have been on the money for weeks now.
"It was really nice to walk in and not have that waft of smoke hit you," said Daniel Flier, 54, while eating lunch at Biggie's Restaurant and Bar on Watson Road, which is known as much for its stale air as it is for its burgers. Flier and his friend, Drew Formenti, 46, said they already noticed that not only did the air seem cleaner, but so did the tables and walls. They probably will go out to eat more and stay longer at bars because of the ban, they said.

That “way” involved donor money — given to promote education and literacy in war-torn and impoverished Central Asia — being spent on charter flights for family vacations, clothing and Internet downloads, the report said. The charismatic Mortenson, whose personal wealth “multiplied significantly” as the charity grew more popular, also took inappropriate speaking fees from the charity for his promotional work, the investigation found.
Alternative energy has stagnated with booming natural gas exploration. The nation's supplies are bulging and natural gas is cheap. By comparison wind power is less economical than many thought it would be two years ago, he said.
Administration officials say they are confident the entire law will be upheld by the Supreme Court, and there's no contingency planning to address whether all or parts of it are struck down. Sharp questioning by the court's conservative justices during public arguments has led many to speculate that at least some parts of the law will be struck down.

Seper's attorney, Chet Pleban, used the last day of testimony Thursday to highlight what he saw as weaknesses in the department's investigation. He asked Capt. John Hayden, the internal affairs commander, why the suspect was never interviewed to resolve the conflict. Hayden said the man was not credible, given his criminal history.
In his Friday letter, Loeb argued that Thompson has to be dumped to avoid "irreparable damage to Yahoo's culture." He argued that Yahoo's own code of ethics justifies firing Thompson "for cause," a move that probably would prevent him for qualifying for a severance package. Yahoo's code states that information filed with the SEC "must be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable."

Secondly, I place a portion of blame on people who work in the public sector but vote against their interests because of certain social issues that politicians pander to for their support (i.e. abortion issues, gun rights and gay marriage). Help me understand why I see public-sector employees or retired persons waving the Gadsden flag? Why not get some consistency? On one hand, you look to resist the heavy-handed U.S. government; however, you don't mind collecting a check from a publicly-funded entity. I'm confused how you reconcile that thinking throughout your daily life -- "Don't Tread on Me, but I will take my publicly financed paycheck, thank you?"
Syria is a strategically important country. This gives added urgency to the crisis: What happens in Syria will affect the security of Israel, the regional strength of Iran, the future of the Arab Spring. Syria is not a significant oil producer by Middle East standards, yet its civil war is in many ways more significant for the world than the one we entered in Libya.

Raised in blue-collar burgs in Monmouth County, Uslan worked at DC Comics while on break from law school at Indiana University and worked as an entertainment lawyer at United Artists, where and a fellow Jersey native Benjamin Melniker acquired the movie rights to Batman in 1979. But no one was interested in making the movie, turned off, likely, by the memory of campy '60s television series.

Andy Glockner, SI.com: "Calipari is an outlandish 101-14 in his three seasons in Lexington and has gone a step further each season, from an Elite Eight exit in 2010 to this year's title-game berth. He has done all of this despite having to mostly start from scratch each season, the outcry about his bastardization of the college game and whispers about Worldwide Wes obscuring the fact that Calipari has done an outstanding coaching (and personality management) job with these teams. The uproar about the one-and-done model is part culture clash and part jealousy. Saturday night, after seeing his Cardinals fade late and lose for the second time this season to their (and his) arch rival, Louisville head coach Rick Pitino issued an extremely backhanded compliment. He feted Calipari's success then said he couldn't do what Calipari does, that he wouldn't be able to say hello and goodbye to players in seven months. Cynics would wonder whether it's just that Pitino can't get those types of players away from Calipari."
"I think Karen, as long as I've known her, felt a calling to serve and be an active participant in her community and her state," Simms said Friday. "Karen is a very driven, smart, independent person.

DENETA SMASHEY: They're married, also, a lot (of them.) Or they're separated, but they all live in the same house. She has her own bedroom; he has his. ...Or they have too young of kids.

A tasting of two dozen Merlots, and dozens more late last year, yielded a slim crop. The fate of Merlot generally in California is a more difficult topic - despite some recent optimism, its reputation needs a lot more work - but after this latest round, it's worth questioning just how much Merlot belongs in the heart of Cabernet country. That's not just my question, but one also raised by some of Napa's serious Cabernet talents.

OK, it's no news flash that blueberries are nutritious. They've been high on our shopping list for a long time. Lately, however, they've been getting more good press than a presidential contender (not hard!). If you were choosing just one fruit to eat every day, a big handful of blueberries -- fresh or frozen -- would be hard to beat. Why?

They are great for wrapping wet garbage, dog poop, broken glass or anything that needs to go into the garbage. It biodegrades and is safe to add to the environment. Before plastic, newspapers were used for lining your garden bin or kitchen garbage waste containers. Want to start a new flower bed or a vegetable garden? Place over weeds or grassy area, using about five or six sheets, sprinkle with mulch and leave over the winter. This kills the vegetation underneath and keeps weeds from coming up. This is also good for keeping the weeds down in your vegetable garden over the winter. Just remove the old newspaper when it's time to plant. Also the very best thing for wrapping breakable items when moving or for storing such items. As good or better than bubble wrap. Finally, use the black and white pages of the newspaper for cleaning windows. Great!

For the character Eastwood should have voiced, called the Spirit of the West, John Logan's script cleverly reimagines Eastwood's poncho-wearing outsider from a trio of Sergio Leone "spaghetti westerns" as a senior citizen searching the sand for treasure using a metal detector.
