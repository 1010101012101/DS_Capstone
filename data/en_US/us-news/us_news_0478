So in our view, we must seize opportunities to help the elderly, the young, and those facing physical, employment, and other challenges.

“That’s Tom Brady’s go-to guy,” Ballard said of Gronkowski, who has caught 20 touchdowns this season. “I don’t know how teams aren’t just hitting him off the line every time. It boggles my mind that they just let him run down the field.”

Then there is the Los Angeles Times. The Times folks get their own little section. There's the obelisk to Harrison Gray Otis, leader of the paper soon after it was founded in 1881 and owner from 1884. He died in 1917. Next to his monument is a curving marble memorial dedicated to his daughter Marian Otis and her husband, Harry Chandler, publisher from 1917 to 1944.
Adam: Right off the bat, I'm going to have to disagree with Arda, and I'll do so on a number of points. First, while I understand where reports of The Miz's interference come from, I wonder if it's even worthwhile at this point. Miz has been buried so far deep through the past year, including being flat-out embarrassed by both Cena and The Rock at Survivor Series, that no one with any common sense would buy into a program involving Miz and either man, or at least not with the perception Miz stands a chance. Second, this match has been heavily promoted as "once in a lifetime," which obviously isn't gospel, but I'd like to believe it will be true. WWE has captured the proverbial lightning in a bottle, but a continued and prolonged feud between these two men would likely wear out its welcome fairly quickly. In my interview last week with Sheamus, "The Great White" said he expects Cena to pull out the win, and I have to agree.
The Chronicle was right in cheering the Mono Lake decision, but the same arguments it used could be applied to San Francisco's misuse of water from Hetch Hetchy. That is why you may someday see a Bee editorial that reads, "The splendid ecosystem that is Hetch Hetchy Valley at least has a serious chance of prospering, thanks to the sapience of the state water board staff in refusing to bow to the greedy demands of San Franciscans for water." Perhaps the most pernicious aspect of Diaz's column was his use of "guilt by association" tactics to disparage groups advocating for Hetch Hetchy. In particular, Diaz mocked U.S. Rep. Dan Lungren's support of restoration, saying "he has become a veritable tree hugger in his embrace of dismantling O'Shaughnessy Dam."

The same cannot be said of Laure's mother, nine months pregnant and perplexed by the implications of her daughter's imposture. Why would her eldest, so motherly to her kid sister, pretend to be a boy? Why would Laure in the guise of Mikael permit Lisa to put lipstick and rouge on her to make the new boy look like a girl?

Fourth, we are pursuing a negotiated peace. In coordination with the Afghan government, my Administration has been in direct discussions with the Taliban. We have made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence, and abide by Afghan laws. Many members of the Taliban - from foot soldiers to leaders - have indicated an interest in reconciliation. A path to peace is now set before them. Those who refuse to walk it will face strong Afghan Security Forces, backed by the United States and our allies.
Radioactive material continues to seep from the plant. The government's nuclear agency said Wednesday that radioactive iodine-131 had been detected at 3,355 times the legal limit in seawater several hundred yards from the Fukushima plant. That's the highest such concentration recorded at sea to date, but specialists said the material's half short life and the diluting effect of the ocean meant there was negligible concern about the impact on human health.

I'm walking from Moore Brother's Village Market -- not a full-service market, but a place to pick up high-end wine, beer and gourmet deli items -- to the town's only lodging accommodations, Magnolia Springs Bed and Breakfast. Taking the long way, down side streets, past bubbling springs and along the river bank, I learn a little bit of history from the town's historical markers. After the Civil War, Magnolia Springs was settled by soldiers from both sides. The community was well-known in the region at the time and highly touted for its pure spring water. It was also once home to a bustling turpentine industry, the remnants of which are long gone. Today, Magnolia Springs is a sleepy hamlet, with its namesake waterway being the last place in the U.S. with a mail route delivered by boat year-round.

Some of the candidates' rhetoric was unfair, if not disingenuous.
Chardonnay is best served as a sipping or cocktail wine. When grown in warm, short growing seasons, it becomes high in alcohol and low in natural acidity. This makes it a meal in itself. It's a different matter when it comes to lobster. There's a trend out there to lean out these overdone wines in California, even making Chardonnay with no oak, but in the meantime, a rich, buttery Chardonnay is lobster's perfect foil.
On her two prior solo albums, Annie “St. Vincent” Clark made it clear that she’s got a taste for Kate Bush-like sonic experimentation — and that she allows herself a certain inattention to melody. “Strange Mercy” transcends the limitations of the first two, not by offering a clutch of catchy tunes (though she could probably do that if she wanted to), but by overwhelming the listener with some of the most wigged-out soundscapes on a pop record in recent memory. Parts of the CD sound like Yes — particularly the synthesizer freakout that caps “Surgeon” and the near-symphonic chorus of “Northern Lights.” “Cruel” comes closest to being a straightforward song, but still threatens to dissipate in a magnetic cloud of overdrive. Clark has managed to make hooks out of her sonic phenomena, and you’ll find yourself anticipating the woodwind flashes, drum breaks and processed guitar solos just as you might a singalong chorus on a more typical pop album. Better still, “Strange Mercy” doesn’t flag, sustaining its mood (guarded but alluring) and its experimental pace (relentless) from beginning to end.

The alarm has been all the more pronounced in the Czech Republic, where many saw a capitulation to Moscow in Obama's decision last year to abandon the anti-missile system proposed by President George W.

There is still too much hard work to do in Wayne County to recover from the past decade. Despite the obvious flaws in his administration, Ficano nonetheless has solid ideas for driving the region forward: a commitment to development around the county's top-notch airport, also known as the aerotropolis plan, in particular, and pushing ahead on regional mass transit, including light rail to Ann Arbor that could finally patch the airport in to a decent public transit option.

Phrag is not native to these shores. It probably got here the same way as the zebra mussel or goby, hitchhiking on some ship, the trio said.

WASHINGTON - Ann Romney fought back Thursday against a Democrat who suggested she's no economic expert because she "hasn't worked a day in her life."

Now, I understand doing it once is one thing, and doing it twice is another. And three times is a challenge. But I think Greg will do it, I think he will put out the effort."

Port Clinton's special-occasion restaurant has been serving tourists and locals alike from its downtown perch for decades (and yes, perch is on the menu). The restaurant, in a century house built on the site of the city's first lighthouse, takes an enlightening approach to food, as well. In addition to a wide variety of full-sized meals, the restaurant offers a selection of mini entrees, smaller portions that won't stuff you. My chicken orzooly ($11.95) was a surprisingly ethnic offering in middle Ohio, with homemade hummus and chicken alongside a parsley and orzo salad. The restaurant has a full bar and a surprisingly sophisticated children's menu.

Before singing one of his Eagles-associated hits, "Best of My Love," Souther told the crowd: "This is my oldest song — it's so old my nieces think it's a folk song."

RHP Poll Pick: This position is a test of fence-sitters everywhere. There is no wrong answer, and apparently there is no right answer. I went with Tom Seaver*. When I first made out my list of the greatest living players, Seaver was one of the first names removed. Fast-forward a few days of research and Seaver was back on the trusty yellow legal bad, listed behind the likes of Bob Gibson, Bob Feller, Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. The more I looked, the more support for Seaver I found. I eventually sided with an ESPN poll of his peers that named him the best, and the influence he had over the next wave of starting pitchers. Still, there's a number of ways to go here. If you go with peak years, you can side with Gibson, Seaver, or Feller, the oldest living Hall of Famer. If you go with longevity and total numbers, Ryan's you're guy. If you go with the dominant heft from an entire career, then hold your nose and pick Clemens. Greg Maddux deserves some attention. And that's why I leave it up to you to pick. Click away. Active candidates: None like these guys.

The obvious omissions were Chicago's great used book stores. Adding those into our pool would’ve made the selection process even more difficult.

Yes, it could have been anticipated. Unlike Lance Berkman, whose status as an elite hitter was in doubt when he signed with the Cardinals, Beltran is simply continuing the level of performance he established last year. His current slugging and on-base percentages are within 10 or 15 points of his full-season marks for 2011.

In the final month of 2011, Beltran bashed 6 homers and drove in 14, adding 7 doubles and 2 triples for good measure. His slugging percentage that month was .700.

In the U.S., babies are rarely born with HIV because most HIV-positive pregnant women here have access to HIV treatment and counseling. In developing countries, maternity programs with a PMTCT component like ours in Luwingu provide an opportunity for mothers be tested for HIV (as well as other dangerous conditions for pregnant women) and to take the steps needed for them and their babies to live healthy lives; as well as for communities to gain productive members instead of incurring yet more losses.

You have to be able to connect with people fast. ... I'll just ask you, "Do you have a sweet tooth? Do you like sweet drinks, sour drinks or hard drinks?" Basically, sweet or sour? It's really, really quick and to the point, especially here at Hyde Park. Tuesday and Thursday, we always have a thousand-plus people. So it has to be really, really quick.

Mandating that schools teach innovation as if it were just another course or funding more charter schools won't solve the problem. The solution requires a new way of evaluating student performance and investing in education. Students should have digital portfolios that demonstrate progressive mastery of the skills needed to innovate. Teachers need professional development to learn how to create hands-on, project-based, interdisciplinary courses. Larger school districts and states should establish new charter-like laboratory schools of choice that pioneer these new approaches.

My suggestion, which I'll offer for free: CalPERS should just deposit the money in stock and bond index funds that charge about 3/100ths of a percent per year in fees (on a $200 billion account) and rebalance periodically. This approach would have earned about 6 percent per year over the past 10 years -- about 2 percent better than what I estimate as CalPERS' actual 4 percent annual results over the period.

• Rapid reaction: Lakers 103, Blazers 92 -- Andy Kamenetzky, ESPN.com: But what really made the outburst exciting was the way those points were accumulated. Portland's lane was stormed like the fate of western civilization depended on its destruction. 20 of those 29 points came in the paint, and it honestly felt like more. Players posted and re-posted for deep position, whether to set up shots at the rim or kick out for a wide open jumper. Off-ball movement was typically directed towards the hoop, and the man with the ball continually located cutters. Seven offensive rebounds were collected due to this dominance down low, which ultimately created a dozen second chance points.

In addition, mulch close to houses is also a problem, Kramer said. In dry conditions — like the ones New Jersey has experienced this spring — mulch can easily catch fire and spread to a structure. The fire will burn the outside of a building until it finds a way inside, meaning it could become quite large before a smoke detector even goes off.
A serious concern is that the trolley route would go in front of University City's historic City Hall.

To investors, though, Cook presented the image of a knowledgeable and successful adviser. His office in the third floor of the fortress-like Van Dusen mansion in Minneapolis -- which everyone called "the castle" -- had a bank of computer monitors streaming market updates. They flashed green every time Cook's trades supposedly made money. And if anyone doubted his track record, he could show them a letter from a California lawyer who supposedly documented his firm's more than $4 billion in assets under management.

Showing, not telling, the themes and messages of the story was a strength of the movie. As a person who has read the entire trilogy, I am also happy to see that scenes not included in the book, but ones that will be significant in later films ("Catching Fire" is said to be released in November 2013), were added to "The Hunger Games" to add some twists and variation to the revered plotline.

One thing that has stood out in SLU's run is that the Billikens haven't let up. As they have gone from one major conference opponent to the next, they've kept right on winning, and by increasingly bigger margins. If there was going to be a time for a letdown, tonight would seem a good candidate: the last game of a nine-day trip with the team playing with a ranking for the first time since most of them were toddlers and coming two days after winning a tournament with three dominating performances. (And Loyola Marymount (3-2) beat UCLA, though that win may be of dubious distinction as the Bruins are foundering.) But SLU hasn't shown any sign of letting up yet and Cassity doesn't think it's coming.

In a time when a certain kind of high-end director likes to take a familiar genre and turn it on its head — witness Christopher Nolan's reinvention of the superhero film — Alfredson fits right in. He's also a particular sort of moody auteur — while most directors just want to stay busy (and many look to jump to Hollywood films after an independent success), Alfredson is willing to wait years for what he thinks is the right film, and wants to make that film how, when and where he wants. (He pretty much knows that he doesn't want to shoot a movie in or near Los Angeles. "You get used to your favorite chair and slippers," he said, perhaps only half-kidding.)

And, of course, Medicare recipients now pay much less for their prescriptions when they reach the donut hole, which, under the PPACA, will be gradually eliminated. This year, Medicare recipients will receive a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs and a 14 percent discount on generics while in the donut hole. And over time, these benefits will grow, so that, starting in 2020, the donut hole will have disappeared entirely. This means that senior citizens will no longer have to pay premiums for Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program, while having to pay the full cost of their drugs at the same time, as they had to do before the act was passed into law.

I asked Dwayne Evans if he thought of taking that rebound with 38 seconds back out and taking time off the clock rather than shooting right away, especially considering he'd missed a bunch of similar shots earlier in the game. "When I get a rebound in there it's going up the majority of the time." he said. "That thought didn't really cross my mind, nor does it ever. I'm just trying to finish the play." Evans said that after his slow start, he let his rebounding generate his offense and eventually his offense came around. That was his fifth double-double. matching his total as a freshman. Willie Reed had eight double-doubles his sophomore season. Evans was +4 in 33 minutes. He took 17 shots, which is the most by a Billiken since Mitchell took 18 at La Salle two years ago.

Second, we have an issue uniting the self-interests of business, government and community, all aligned for the good of Oregon. That issue is post-secondary education. Employers need from our community colleges and universities a well-educated and trained work force as well as university research that creates jobs. Our colleges and universities need the support of the business community to foster a belief that government resources allocated to post-secondary institutions are investments that produce a return for Oregon. We have an opportunity to create a new "education after high school" compact with Oregonians that would allow our young people to live, work and be educated in the state if we provide the colleges and universities with the operational flexibility and the resources they need to deliver.

He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed Him not. Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed Him stricken, struck down by God and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; upon Him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted. Yet He opened not His mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its bearers is silent, so He opened not His mouth.
