By all accounts Lillian Lowery, the Delaware educator who was named Maryland's state superintendent of schools Friday, comes to the job with an impressive resume and a reputation as a consensus builder who can work with teachers, principals and local school districts to get things done. She'll need all those skills and more to implement the kinds of reforms Maryland needs, and she'll have to hit the ground running if she is to make progress on the array of thorny issues that require her immediate attention.

Of all the locations, the Henry River Mill Village has a back story that's nearly as colorful as the plot of the movie. The mill, which opened in 1905, produced fine yarn. The village was designed as a planned community with company stores, walkways and green spaces. In 1966, a sheriff was shot and killed in the village by a mill worker. By the time Shepherd bought the town, three years after the mill closed, there were Thursday night poker games on the street, "and by Sunday afternoon, they were all drunk and shooting."
Savas concurred that improving transportation infrastructure is crucial for existing companies as well as luring businesses to the county. But he thinks the county has wasted time and failed to push for federal funding to improve the Sunrise corridor, beyond what is being undertaken, and planning for similar business clusters. That has put the county in last place in the metro race for job creation, he said.
Carefully spread the seasoning mixture between the cabbage leaves, dividing it as evenly as possible and seasoning all the layers. Pack the seasoned cabbage into a non-reactive container, such as a large wide-mouth glass jar or an earthenware crock. (The pepper powder will stain a plastic container.)

Heavy caseloads are one cause of the backlog. Politics is the other.
The original federal legislation protected all Americans from housing discrimination based upon their race, religion, national origin, color or sex. In 1987, Congress added protection against housing discrimination based on familial status or handicapped status. State and local governments can add to these federally protected classes. Missouri has added ancestry to the list. The only local government in our area to add categories is the city of St. Louis, which has added protection from discrimination based on marital status, age, source of income or sexual orientation.

Which coalition emerges victorious will determine whether labor or business has majority support on the county Board of Supervisors, a factor that will matter greatly in future budget negotiations and in other policy areas. What happens to the troubled Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Medical Center will likely be determined by who fills Burke's seat. And the outcome of the election also will give us more information about the types of coalitions that are likely to emerge in districts formerly dominated by African Americans but in which the racial and ethnic mixes are changing. With the 2010 census on the horizon -- and redistricting reform on the agenda -- the challenge of building alliances across racial and ethnic lines is likely to become even more pressing.

"This is not a trivial area," Gingrich insisted. Perhaps not. But his rambling farewell was a reminder of why his candidacy, like his speakership, was destined to fail: Gingrich occasionally has brilliant ideas and strategies, but they are difficult to find amid the clutter of his mind and oratory, and that makes him seem unpredictable and unstable.

Season to Risk followed. The band has been around since 1989 and has gone through several lineup changes. Thursday's version was the 1995-99 lineup, with Josh Newton on bass. Steve Tulipana is the band's lead singer, and he showed off his engaging front-man moves throughout the set  moves he doesn't get to express in his other bands (Roman Numerals, Thee Water Moccasins). It's always great to see a band leader who looks like he's having as much fun as anyone in the place. Its music is a blend of noise, crunch, hard-groove and melody. Its set list included Game Over, Mine Eyes, Jack Frost and Snakes, which Tulipana dedicated to writer Harry Crews, who died March 28.

One thing is certain: The euro cannot survive without a major change in the governance structure of the euro zone. The first prescription for what ails the zone was "austerity", but that has produced recessions and government oustings. Then came the European Financial Stability Facility, but it turns out to be too puny to halt the bond vigilantes' rampage through the euro zone, and anyhow rests in part on France's waning ability to join Germany as a guarantor by retaining its triple-A credit rating.

Section 136 (Farmers Market): RedBridge gluten-free beer.
Like Ruth — who was a top-notch pitcher before he became an everyday outfielder — Springsteen can do it all. His singing is so powerful, his songwriting is so profound and his stage presence is so magnetic, in fact, that he’s rarely thought of as one of rock’s great guitarists. But he is that as well. For “Born to Run,” he famously said he wanted to write like Bob Dylan, sing like Roy Orbison and sound like Phil Spector. Imagine the audacity required to aspire to any one of those things. Imagine the talent required to pull them off, simultaneously.

Since almost everyone's ox will be gored, there is pressure on both parties to do something when Congress returns to work this week. And what Congress does -- or doesn't do -- may be the best indicator voters will get before Election Day as to whether either party can set aside ideology long enough to act in the nation's best interest.
The upgrades are designed to ensure that the next major earthquake does not cause a devastating disruption to the region's water supply. Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park supplies water to 2.5 million customers in San Francisco, San Mateo County and the East Bay.

CHICAGO  First there were feathers, then the "Hunger Games" braid took over. Now there's a new hair trend just as easy to embrace  coloring strands with craft-store chalk. No stylist, no complicated instructions, no great expense.
And yet, far from being a curiosity, the sort of thing cinematic obsessives make for each other — like Guy Maddin’s constructivist collages — “The Artist” is very much a movie-movie, with slapstick, sentiment and even a big musical number.
Maybe it is because he plays in Sacramento and does much of his work late at night on the East Coast and is almost never on national television. Maybe it is because Brandon Jennings' 55-point game back in November was so mesmerizing that he's been overshadowed. Maybe it is because No. 1 overall pick Blake Griffin has yet to play in a game, and it's affected the perception of the kids.

The current situation has been in the making for half a decade: Five years ago this week, the Cardinals announced their highly controversial decision to leave KMOX, ending a relationship that was widely popular with fans near and far. But the Cards fled for what they thought was a more lucrative deal, buying 50 percent of KTRS - and gaining final say on decisions - for the bargain-basement price of $2 million.
This groundbreaking vegetarian restaurant lost opening chef Jeremy Fox, but protege Aaron London is doing his part to move us to a plant-based cuisine. His combinations include a feast of cucumbers and potatoes - raw, roasted, buried in ash and made into an emulsion; and traditional steamed buns stuffed with burrata and coated with crunchy corn. Even avowed carnivores will be seduced by his complex combinations and the beautifully crafted space where you can see the shadows of students bending and twisting during their yoga lessons. It sounds too New Age, but the cuisine is firmly planted on the ground.

Thunderous standing ovations and double-fisted slams against the arena glass are NHL loyalists' way of salivating over intimidating body shots, knockdown brawls and concussion-producing head shots. The basketball player formerly known as Ron Artest fires a vicious elbow to the head of his unsuspecting opponent on national TV and the home crowd cheers him as he's tossed out the game, while everyone else in basketball cringed and called for Commissioner David Stern to punish him severely.
After winning the Suburban North Conference four straight seasons (it tied for the top spot in 2008), PATTONVILLE was forced to settle for third last season. But with 15 seniors on this year's squad. the Pirates figure to be in the mix for the league's top honors again.
A: I liked the story, and I felt like there was room for interpretation. I felt like the relationship between these people, these two -- actually all of Blomkvist's relationships with women -- were unlike anything I had seen. He's not a movie hero. He's certainly not a Hollywood hero. I've spent my whole life around women, and Stieg Larsson (the novel's author) has described that and how complicated that is, and lovely and all that. But it's also a complicated thing.
"I hope everybody realizes that we have no money," she said. "As much as you might love the teams when you have no money, it's a very different game."

This can't all be explained by lucky people having partners who are actually sweeter, smarter or sexier than everyone else. Researchers adjust for that in their studies. What seems to be important is viewing one's partner and relationship as better than the evidence warrants.

The genial hole-in-the-wall with the perennial line out the door has a couple of years of serving up marvelous sammies under its belt, and it continues to impress with potent flavors and no-frills hominess. From the sour pickles through the pie holes, from the meatball parmigiano hero to the humble grilled cheese, each item on the menu has its own character and merits a try. And for heaven's sake don't forget the side dishes, which are good enough to imagine as lunches in their own right. The wait here is daunting, but worth it.
After that, they sat down with their 6-year-old twin grandchildren, Kaiden and Chevelle Woods, and explained that the puppy had gone to heaven.
You wouldn't expect to find a sake cooler stocked with 70 bottlings at a bargain sushi place in downtown Oakland. Or just about anywhere. But there it is, across the rear wall at Ichiro, otherwise a bare-bones Japanese restaurant where good, well-priced sushi is the other main draw.
Boulder police Chief Mark Beckner on Monday said Boulder police conduct internal investigations whenever an officer is charged criminally.

The IRS did not respond Wednesday. But the complaints by Zawistowski, other Tea Party leaders and the senators appear to be the latest episode in an ongoing tussle over the political activities of some nonprofit groups. Under law as well as longstanding policy, the IRS granted nonprofit status to so-called 501 (c) (4) groups that promoted social welfare, as long as the majority of their work was not considered political.

"The criminals did not send us any letter, nor did they send us a message through any of the brothers," he wrote of the Iranians.

Hey, Robert: The Kardiac Kids ran something close to the Don Coryell offense in the 1980s. It's the old-style West Coast offense -- more vertical routes based on a power running game. Norv Turner ran that style with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1990s and does the same with the current Chargers. That's much different from the stereotypical West Coast offense the Browns are trying to run. Sipe's arm may have been weaker than McCoy's, but he had incredible timing and anticipation with his passes and the chemistry with his offensive teammates was rare.

Emory professor Drew Westen, a liberal, essentially admitted in a New York Times piece that Republicans were right when they said Obama's lack of experience was a warning sign.

It's a matter of us stepping up and fixing our mistakes from Game 1 and making sure we get a win in Game 2."

Though the contractual terms are generous for Haiti, there is plenty to be cautious about. Haiti's government is repeatedly rated as one of the most corrupt in the world.

After the birth of my youngest, Melissa, June's blood pressure was sky high. The hospital wouldn't let John up to sit with us because he wasn't family. The room was dark. The door opens and this figure in a scrub suit with hat and surgical mask pushed a cart in. I knew immediately it was John. He had dressed up in what he found in a supply room.

Nor are tourists relevant now. If cartels do not have a hands-off policy, neither do they have any particular interest in going after tourists.

The pro-war powers talked about winning the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people and the domino effect that would occur if the country fell to the communist forces.

More Inverness: The 1979 U.S. Open will be remembered for the planting of a tree on the eighth hole during the tournament. In the first round, Lon Hinkle discovered the 528-yard eighth could be shortened considerably by playing onto the adjoining 17th fairway, thereby eliminating the severe dogleg left. He hit a 1-iron off the tee through the trees, hit a 3-iron approach and two-putted for birdie. It didn't take long for fellow competitors to follow. By 5 a.m. the next day, the USGA had planted a 24-foot black spruce, blocking Hinkle's route.

The property was a gravel pit. And when you've got a hole, you might as well fill it up with trash. That's how we used to look at things. So the previous owner, Rose City Sand & Gravel, allowed H.G. Lavelle to operate it as a demolition landfill from 1972 to 1982. It was meant for brick and concrete construction debris, but DEQ records indicate wood, yard clippings and household garbage got tossed in, too.

He told the children and teens gathered for an assembly about the charitable aspect of his efforts and the reality show. He did not mention where he got the name for his show, "The Long Road Home."
So he won the turf war, for now. He was modest in victory, even trying to return to the one-of-the-boys status he once enjoyed in the locker room, and he did it by reminding Woodson that he is "one of the leaders of this team, (so) if he sees anything I’m not doing, hold me accountable. That’s the biggest thing Coach Woodson can do, is hold everyone accountable for what happens on the court."
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Friday's lackluster effort against the Chicago Bulls had the feel of oh-so-many of the Cavaliers games last season.

Since the new span will be a cable-stayed design, I turned for ideas toward what was once the largest of its kind, the Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, Canada. It is named for a politician and crosses the Fraser River, named for a different guy who was an explorer. A double-duty name.

It is disheartening for a ballclub to get to the eighth or ninth inning with a lead and not have someone capable of slamming the door. Too often last year, the Astros were sent to the clubhouse in a sorry mood because the bullpen was too sorry to save the day.

ø2. New York Giants: GM Jerry Reese had five selections in the first four rounds and seemed to masterfully adhere to his penchant for taking the best player while simultaneously addressing need with all five choices.

I understand that there is some Pujols fatigue out there -- heck, my email box was loaded with it after his press conference Monday -- but I thought it was worth bringing these comments to the StlToday.com readers because there was so much coverage of Pujols' problem with the nickname. La Russa made it a large part of his time with the media at the winter meetings in 2009 and used Pujols' wish as an example of how fond the first baseman was of Cardinals' history and the icons came before him.

The news has also been hard to take because coverage of the real issue of poverty in our region has been obscured by the insinuation of troubles at MetroHealth. We have a stellar group of physicians and nurses who are committed to the value of serving all, teaching the next generation of physicians and doing valuable research. We offer high quality and a competitive value proposition for employers. As a public hospital, we adhere to public records and "sunshine laws," a level of transparency that is uncharacteristic for hospitals. Talented, committed volunteer board members run the hospital with a significant commitment of time each month. Outside auditors verify our financial integrity, and the hospital has run a surplus for the last several years. Most importantly, we have dramatically increased our service to the uninsured -- we are performing to mission. Innuendo is distracting our community from the real issue -- how to keep the poverty crisis from becoming a public health crisis.

What changed: Possibly momentum if the 49ers are any closer to the maker there. Tuck got flagged for a tick-tack shoulder nudge of 49ers Pro Bowl punter Andy Lee, and if the 49ers were a yard closer, they’d be looking at a fresh set of downs inside Giants territory. Instead, it’s still fourth-and-1 and the conservative Jim Harbaugh decided not to rest the Giants short-yardage defense (and rightfully so given their track record so far in these playoffs). Though that drive was largely driven by another Giants penalty — Aaron Ross was flagged for an illegal contact on third-and-19 a few plays before — you never know how another three plays could shape the course of that game.

Our popcorn from Mr. Bilder was confiscated and we had to carry the bars of candy deep in our trouser pockets, to be retrieved and eaten furtively in the dark theater.

Outlook: McDonogh has the nation's longest active girls lacrosse winning streak with 56 victories, and the three-time defending IAAM A Conference champion Eagles have also won eight straight over the Mawrtians. Last season, the Mawrtians were within a goal with two minutes to play but fell, 11-9. They haven't beaten the Eagles since 2005. Bryn Mawr, behind Wolf's 13 saves, played well defensively last season, but it wasn't quite enough to hold off the Eagles' powerhouse attack. McDonogh averages 18.8 goals, but the Eagles must shoot well against Wolf, who is rated the No. 2 senior goalie in the country by ESPNHS and allows just 6.1 goals per game. The Mawrtians are better than most teams at handling the Eagles' relentless pressure on the ball, a force that wears opponents down physically and mentally in the second half. Under that pressure, however, the Mawrtians need to win draws and 50-50 balls and remain aggressive on offense to generate enough goals in what is likely to be a higher scoring game than they would prefer.

Doyle Drive stood for 75 years and survived the '89 quake when much of the Marina did not. Seismically fragile? That is the excuse used for the boondoggle at the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge. How long has that "work" been going on? "Expert" testimony is claimed to be undeniable, like the expert testimony that had WMDs in Iraq. I am sure that its replacement will be fine, but Doyle Drive was a marvel and unique. That horrible crash years ago with the drunk in the Porsche could have happened with or without a center barrier. Millions and millions of cars have safely negotiated Doyle Drive.

WASHINGTON -- Instead of fighting a phony mommy war over what Hilary Rosen said about Ann Romney, we should face the fact that most families these days cannot afford to have one parent stay home with the kids.

Although there is no cure for osteoporosis, treatment is available to prevent further bone loss. The key is early identification of not only those already affected by it, but also those at risk for developing it. This is accomplished with a simple test to measure bone density. Your physician may order this test, which entails a quick and painless scan of your hips and spine. A computer compares your bone density to that of a normal 20-year-old, identifying whether or not you are at risk for fractures of the wrist, hip and spine. The lower the bone density, the higher the risk.

The fact of the matter is that Paterno did not witness anything. A graduate assistant came to his house in the middle of the night after supposedly witnessing the act to tell him about it. The assistant was the witness, the assistant should have stopped the act immediately and/or called the police. How do we know Paterno did not advise him to do this? After the fact what was Paterno supposed to do? Could the assistant even identify the child so the police could find him and corroborate his story? One other point to remember is that this all happened when Paterno was 74 years old, what frame of reference does he even have to be able to digest the story that a 28 year old graduate assistant has just told him? It seems that Sandusky is not a big enough fish for the press to fry so they need to drag Paterno into this mess.

They say he wasn't being physically aggressive, as police and prosecutors maintain.
