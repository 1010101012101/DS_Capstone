The ramshackle, dollar-bills-stapled-to-the-walls Bucksnort Saloon (15921 Elk Creek Road, 303-838-0284, thebucksnortsaloon .com) has been legendary since forever — the place started out as a mercantile in the late 1800s, and when it turned into a bar is a matter of debate, as well as whether the name of the place is one word or two (it depends on whom you ask). Over the years, John Elway made it a regular stop (he rode a motorcycle there), and Neil Young ate there, and the place still has live music on the weekends that keeps the locals in the canyon up late. The half-pound burger is why people stop by, but you have to order it medium-rare, or it comes out dry.

And as fans, were no better. We know the story. We understand the violence. And yet we love the game. Some fans are genuinely concerned about the Saints bounty story. But honestly, most fans think it happens all the time anyway.

We're just finishing hijiki (seaweed salad) when our fried chicken and oxtail fried rice arrive. "You want the appetizers first?" the runner asks when we wonder what's going on.

Frankly, the sushi is sorry looking, more like something you'd get in a strip mall sushi joint.

If we want reliable and sustainable energy with which to combat intensifying summer heat, we must push Annapolis to invest in new and better energy sources. Clean sources of energy like offshore wind power are essential components of a movement to reduce fossil fuel use and slow the trend of global warming to which these record breaking heat waves are clearly linked. Because it's a local source, it can also reduce the number of supply incidents caused by a constricted and overloaded grid like the one BGE faced.

Some kids are just drawn to animals. For them, it will be inspiring to read "The Watcher: Jane Goodall's Life With the Chimps" by Jeanette Winter (Schwartz & Wade Books: $17.99, ages 4-8). This deceptively simple biography begins with Jane's family frantically searching high and low for their 5-year-old, only to have her burst out of the henhouse with the triumphant cry: "I know how an egg comes out!" Detailing her legendary powers of observation, the story follows her to Africa and into the bush, where she patiently waited for the chimpanzees to trust her so that she could learn their secrets.

FROM THE MAILBAG
El-P's ominous production here immediately draws you in, establishing the mood before the beat kicks in with dark, hypnotic bass and tambourine. The gospel-flavored chorus hook, by Scar, is undeniable. And Killer Mike tops El-P's cinematic score with brilliant turns of phrase. In the opening verse, he wonders, if he's slain, "Will my woman be Coretta, take my name and cherish it? Or will she be Jackie O, drop the Kennedy, remarry it?" The next verse finds him giving honor to the baby mommas. "It takes a woman's womb to make a Christ or Dalai Lama," he reasons. "The world might take that child, turn that child into a monster/The Lord'll take a monster and fashion him a saint/I present you Malcolm X for those who saying that he can't."

The Buford that I think the Buckeyes really need is the 12 points on 5-of-12 shooting one, like the guy who was there in Ohio State's win over Indiana on Jan. 15. It's that Buford who maybe isn't having a great shooting night but helps in other ways, who gets a couple of easy baskets off his defense or in transition, and isn't the reason that the Buckeyes win or lose. He's just a pretty good player having an average night.

The national obsession with guns, and the lunacy of American gun laws that set different rules for gun resellers than new-gun dealers or that allow people to possess military assault rifles intended to kill cops rather than hunt deer or protect one's home, are frequent fodder for Times editorials. But things are different in California; not only does this state have some of the toughest gun restrictions in the nation, its largely urban and liberal Legislature sometimes treads unacceptably on 2nd Amendment rights -- in a way that offends even some gun-control advocates.

Left out in the cold, the young woman landed in Indianapolis. Now, 25 years later, Kelly Williams has written her haunting memoir, "A Gradual Redemption." The book (www.agradualredemption.com) is hard to put down. At one level it's a pro-life story. With the help of a crisis pregnancy center, she resists the pressure to get an abortion. That saves her from a guilty conscience.

Answer: Latin American airlines generally have had to modernize because the industry previously went through its own collapse. A couple of decades ago, most airlines were state-controlled.

◆ Andrew Luck is considered the best quarterback prospect since Peyton Manning, but he has a long way to go to live up to that, if for no other reason than he's inheriting a worse supporting cast.

As a wily, baseball-crazy 12-year-old, I learned that with a self-addressed stamped envelope, I could secure free game tickets for the Plain Dealer Grandstand Managers Night. On this sticky summer night, I led my mother, brother and buddy down West 3rd after a bus ride downtown. We entered the venerable Municipal Stadium and my heartbeat increased, as it always did when I looked upon the emerald field surrounded by its steel and concrete horseshoe. We found general admission seats just past the left-field foul pole, and about 20 rows back from outfielder Chuck Hinton.

The state already administers income taxes charged by Ohio school districts. Statewide, in the fiscal year that ended June 30, the school district income tax grossed $347.4 million; the state's administrative fee was 1.5 percent -- or about $5.2 million. The administration suggests that such centralized municipal tax collection would be more efficient and easier for business and cheaper administratively, meaning municipalities could keep more of what is collected.

Buying bundles of Treasurys knocks down interest rates, making borrowing cheap. But it also motivates investors to move out of safe investments into riskier ones in search of better returns. The stock market, for instance, rises in value and everyone with some of their savings in stocks feels wealthier. Ideally, it produces what what economists call a "wealth effect": People who feel better off spend more.

He lets me do what I can for his boys, and right now everyone's happy with where we're at."

When the shuttle first flew in 1982, it was a technological marvel, the most sophisticated and capable launch vehicle ever built. It overcame much of the waste of conventional, expendable rockets, which shed their lower stages as they ascended through the atmosphere. The shuttle's orbiter could return to Earth, land like an airplane and fly again.
"As a generalization, of these three swing states, Ohio is the middle," Brown said. "Pennsylvania is a little more Democratic and Florida is a little more Republican.

C.S. Lewis wrote presciently about what happens when people lose faith in their institutions. In the final book of "The Chronicles of Narnia," the Narnians were duped into believing in a false Aslan — a false God. Unfortunately, once the lie was exposed, some refused to side with the good Narnians; and when the final battle broke out, they stood around the outskirts of the battle and shot at anything that moved.

THE ANSWER: There are a couple things I always say around here: When in doubt do something. Sometimes in an organization you see the paralysis of analysis, where people just don't do anything. If you've got an issue or a problem, you have to do something. You can't just sit and wait because that's definite failure. I'd rather fail going down in flames because I tried something rather than fail because I did nothing, which you'll certainly fail that way.

And the hard-eyed politician's approach to the black community is: Where else you gonna go? To Mitt Romney? The whitest man who ever lived? A fabulously wealthy governor's son who can't speak a sentence that isn't awkward, self-indicting and grotesquely dismissive of every hope and dream of the black community? And if not Romney, you're going to . . . sit on your hands and not go to the polls and let a Ken doll get elected president, because you want Obama not to address the 10 percent of wavering independents who somehow haven't yet figured out what they believe in? You want Obama to not try to grab them but instead diddle you so you feel better about the only sensible thing you could do?
On the panel were three Republicans (two from the Senate, one from the House) and three Democrats (two from the House, one from the Senate). The co-chairs were Rep. Vernon Sykes, an Akron Democrat, and Sen. Shannon Jones, a suburban Cincinnati Republican.
The Bykota Center is one of a number of facilities in the Baltimore-Washington region where former players like Piersanti and Bucky Kimmett, who both played at Towson in the late 1940s and early 1950s, can try to recreate the moves they made more than 60 years ago. And others who never even played in high school can experience the exhillaration of hitting a game-winning shot.

Comparisons are the essence of subjectivity, and so I understand why readers often draw upon them in critiquing how The Kansas City Star covers the news.
The first film in 14 years from writer-director Whit Stillman ("Barcelona," "The Last Days of Disco") is a slight piece of work, but agreeably peculiar. The damsels of the title -- "Philadelphia Story" girls in a "Jersey Shore" world -- are New England college coeds who make it their mission to uplift their campus' male barbarians and do some good for humankind. Violet (Greta Gerwig) leads the young ladies into volunteer service at the campus Suicide Prevention Center, where they offer doughnuts, tap lessons and scented soaps to the forlorn visitors. The film skewers Violet's cockeyed do-gooderism, but we never question her sincerity. Stillman gives her every virtue a twit can have: cheerfulness, modesty, kindness, self-reliance and boundless courage. Rated PG-13; mature themes, some sexual content. 1 hour, 39 minutes. By Colin Covert, Star Tribune (Minneapolis).
Andrea Sneiderman, barred from the DeKalb courthouse last week after prosecutors alleged she interfered with witnesses, called Neuman six times after being told by Dunwoody Prep’s assistant director there had been an accident.

The pressure of stepping into his uncle’s shoes — at the Izod Center, no less — had to have been immense, but he never wilted, which speaks volumes about his self-confidence as well as his talent. Springsteen looked overjoyed to have Clemons by his side, winning over the crowd with one foot planted in history and the other firmly in the present.
"I am surprised and disappointed to hear that OEA has changed course and now opposes Senate Bill 909 and a package of modest education reforms that would deliver better results for students, more resources for teachers and more accountability for taxpayer dollars", he said.
Modern artists changed all that. They went to great lengths to sweep away 400 years' worth of such powerful techniques. Few, however, went quite so far as McLaughlin did.
To be sure, high-tech companies are higher-risk investments, and they could lose value quickly if the market tanks because of a debt catastrophe in Europe or something unforeseen.
"I would hope that most people know that we don't have a culture of waste, that we are very much interested in making sure our customers know they're getting the best value for their dollar," Allison said.

Now, lawsuits and other court filings are brought to the courthouse; a clerk date stamps them, arranges them in a manila folder and adds them to the file stacks in cabinets throughout the building. When cases go before a judge, clerks pull the files, sometimes hundreds for a single docket, place them in carts and wheel them to the courtroom.

• 5-star linemen key Stanford's recruiting class -- Tom FitzGerald, San Francisco Chronicle: Shaw's first complete recruiting class was ranked fifth in the nation by Rivals.com and sixth by Scout.com. Both services had the Cardinal tops in the Pac-12 even though USC, UCLA and Oregon all did well. Shaw called the 22-man group "one of the best classes in the history of the school." As it turned out, he fared even better on the recruiting trail than his predecessor, Jim Harbaugh, a master salesman who landed three straight Top 25 classes.

But economists found that much of Minnesota's export growth occurred earlier in the year. Fourth-quarter exports grew just 1.4 percent to $5.09 billion from the same period in 2010. Much of that growth was due to an uptick in orders from China and South Korea.
On the whole, however, this Bo vs. Seamus debate is a luxury of full stomachs. That we tend to anthropomorphize animals is an understatement given that Americans spend about $50 billion a year on their family pets. Thus, eating a dog is viewed as tantamount to cannibalization. Installing a dog in a crate for 12 hours atop a speeding car may as well be child abuse.

This isn't the first time there has been talk of the U.P. shedding itself of the trolls. (Trolls are creatures who live under the bridge, in this case, the Mackinac Bridge.) U.P. secession has come up periodically ever since Michigan lost what's called the Toledo War in 1836, and ended up with the U.P. instead of Toledo. The Michigan Legislature defeated U.P. secession by a single vote in the 1970s.

Fourth round. I bend to touch the earth, recite "All my relations," go inside the lodge to my towel. It is soaked with sweat, has been since round one. For round four, Dennis has had all the rocks brought in, all the Grandfathers. The water seems to form steam before it even reaches them. He asks us to pray for those in other villages performing the Sun Dance, to go to them if we can and give them strength. I am hot, so hot. I drop to the ground immediately. A few minutes pass. Dennis speaks.

That same inflation has pushed Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III to the top of the 2012 draft boards. Would the No. 4 pick be better spent on a franchise quarterback than on Trent Richardson? Absolutely. But if that's not possible -- and I'm not buying Ryan Tannehill as a close replica of Griffin III -- the Browns need to take the best offensive player who can make the biggest impact. That's Richardson, whom some believe is the best back since Peterson.
øIt's not yet clear what, if anything, will come of the review. But records of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases show publicly traded companies are leery about going to trial against the government.

If you want a romantic hot-air balloon ride, or a scenic flight over the coastal plains in an open cockpit biplane, talk to David and he'll help arrange it. For nature buffs, hikers and bird watchers, Magnolia Springs makes a good base of operations for exploring the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge and the Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, as well as the Alabama Coastal Birding Trail. Animal lovers will not want to miss the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo and its "Animal Encounters" program that allows visitors to have direct inside-the-cage experiences with young kangaroos, lemurs and other animals. The zoo was featured in the Animal Planet series, "The Little Zoo That Could." It's a short drive north to the artsy town of Fairhope, east to the surprising shopping mecca that is Foley (lots of outlet stores), and south to the lively beach hangouts in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach. Or, you could simply stay off-the-radar in Magnolia Springs and be perfectly content to hide away in the trees by the river, with a walk to the corner store, or a fishing lure cast in the river, being the only concerns of the day.
Schwab added another contemporary touch in the formal dining room by hanging a polished chrome and glass chandelier above the dining table.

"I knew he was trying to be impartial, but I also knew he had a rooting interest in Cleveland," Cohen said. "There was some poetic license in terms of what was going on, but most of the stuff was by the book. What was different was you'd get two or three takes. And it was a lot shorter."
The sheriff's search of the house found graphic evidence of the brutality: the sticks and 2-by-4s, which appeared to be bloodstained; a 13-inch steel hammer; pliers; the pink high heel; and the steel-toe boot. One wooden stick with staples in the end, found behind a dresser, had red stains on one end and "black curly fiber or hair attached," court records show.

The Rams really did like Justin Blackmon. They weren't as nearly as up on Notre Dame WR Michael Floyd. It didn't matter on Floyd; he went 13th overall to Arizona. But the Rams weren't planning on drafting him at No. 14. Some will think they're crazy for having that attitude about Floyd, but again, it's irrelevant ... he was gone at No. 13. And they sure as hell weren't going to do something foolish by trading up to get a WR that didn't thrill them.

One can hope for justice, but what is hope compared to money? Mumbai's lifeblood is corruption: doctors demand bribes to provide care, attorneys to get your case heard. Allocated resources rarely wind up where they are supposed to (think about that the next time you donate to an NGO) and, unable to surmount what feels like forever hopelessness, teenagers commit suicide by eating rat poison. But there is also dazzle, the discos and roses and banquets of the hotels, a veritable Oz to Annawadi youth who score jobs there. Too, there is tenderness and expectation: Manju, daughter of Asha and her mother's moral opposite, "hungered for virtue," and Sunil, who unlike Abdul, does not want always to scavenge, because "I don't like myself, doing this work. It's like being an insult."
Gilmore rocketed up draft charts in the evaluation period and the Bills jumped at the chance to add the Rock Hill, S.C., native to their secondary.

The Riviera Maya owes its existence to Cancun; its fishing villages were perfect respites from the high-rise luxury, crowded beaches, thumping discos and Las Vegas-by-the-Sea vibe. Not so long ago, Playa del Carmen was the refuge of choice, but now it's Mexico's fastest-growing city, less the anti-Cancun than the rival Cancun. Tulum's sublime beaches are lined cheek by jowl with thatch-roofed cabanas that charge $150 and (way) up for the privilege of doing without electricity and air conditioning. The isolated beaches hidden at the ends of dirt roads are shadowed now by fantastically expensive resorts.
