That means Reid needs to encourage more give and take over the range of measures that can help clear the jails. But it also means Fuerst has to do her job and get cases moving in her court. And that requires, first and foremost, ending her unreasonable opposition to a pilot program that moves cases through the courts faster by assigning judges to low-level felony cases earlier in the process.
He added, “At my request, Father Vashon assumed additional responsibilities, becoming pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish, one of our largest parishes, after its pastor was transferred.”
The roasted chicken entree exemplifies Seeber's restrained approach. There are no gimmicks here, just handsomely presented and patiently prepared pieces of flavorful chicken, served with sauteed kale and a pretty white bean and tomato casserole. An entree of stout-glazed 24-hour short ribs, served with roasted turnips and pickled red onions, is similarly effective and flavor-focused.
A new dividing wall limits the view for motorists trying to enter the highway, and ODOT officials said that braking at the end of the ramp provides the best way for drivers to check and see if all's clear to go forward.

"I didn't get much this spring. I really like getting a lot of at-bats in spring. I didn't get much of those. The rehab assignment was my spring training."

But in some ways, I'm even less impressed with the Vita. It shares the same misguided premise as the PSP in offering full-scale games on a portable device. Worse, its smartphone-like features feel half-hearted and often detract from the core gaming experience.

All of which could have been foretold, I suppose, when Stephen Daldry (“The Reader,” “The Hours”) was announced as director.

There is no rush to address the city's election calendar this year. Baltimore voters are not set to go to the polls again until 2015, which gives lawmakers plenty of time to adopt state Sen. Nathaniel McFadden's sensible proposal to hold one city election on the presidential cycle in 2016 (giving the current incumbents, including Ms. Rawlings-Blake, an extra year in office) and thereafter on the gubernatorial cycle, starting in 2018. Alternatively, the city could hold one more off-year election in 2015 and then switch to the gubernatorial cycle in 2018. That has the disadvantage of costing the city financially but the advantage of making sure no officials hold office for a longer or shorter term than voters bargained for.

Vinology, a wine bar/restaurant in Ann Arbor, Mich., focuses on wine. The décor features wine-related paraphernalia, and the food is designed to enhance wine. That doesn't mean the food comes second.

Thai Elephant is as sleek and modern as the upscale outdoor mall it's in. The high ceilings, nouveau Asian design, bamboo tables and open dining room have a refined elegance. The food is refined as well; but with Thai cooking, that's not always a good thing. The edges have been smoothed out to appeal to a wide palette of palates. A Chiang Mai noodle dish is supposed to evoke the feel of Thai street food, but the exquisitely dressed bowl of noodles swimming in a yellow curry and topped with a nest of fried noodles seems like it's holding back. A special of red curry had a nice rounded taste but somehow didn't reach its full flavor potential. The same can be said for the almost-there pad thai noodles.

2) The World Invitational Hula Festival, also known as E Ho' I Mai Ika Piko Hula, is more inclusive, summoning troupes from around the world to compete at the Waikiki Shell for three days in November. While hula-crazy Japan fielded the most hula halau (troupes) last year, participants also came from Mexico City, Colombia, New York and the Philippines. Although it's a competition, the dancers learn a chant together and share a meal beforehand in the spirit of aloha. This year's festival takes place Nov. 6-8.

Throughout his career, that has been Arrieta's biggest asset and primary downfall. He was a good high school pitcher, but was overshadowed by other prep right-handers in Texas. He kept working, and for several years took private pitching lessons from former major league closer Mike Henneman, who stressed the mental side of the game.
And as for the villainy department, we shouldn't expect Tiger Woods to be a model of marital fidelity just because he can play golf better than anyone else in the galaxy. Nor should we have expected the many members of baseball's steroid club to resist injecting themselves with illegal substances so they could make more money. After all, the Wall Street barons who nearly brought the country to its knees are drawing huge bonuses at what amounts to taxpayer expense, and Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire didn't have MBAs to fall back on.

"It is the best competition in the country by far," said Gentile, the SLSG coach who has teams that play in the ECNL. "You cannot take any days off. If you have a bad day, you get punished for that.

I decided to return another night for the regular menu. It was more successful, but I was shocked at the wine list, where the least expensive California Pinot Noir was $120. It's a tremendous, well-curated list, but still that's a lot to pay for a "regular" weeknight meal.
It was a glossy departure from his hardscrabble childhood  he spent several years in an orphanage  and his stint as an Israeli soldier at age 20. Both experiences were chronicled in the 2010 documentary Vidal Sassoon: The Movie, as was another knotty subject: his brand's dilution.

Not only do I applaud the cameras that ticket speeders and red-light runners, I would like to have sound-sensitive devices installed all around the city. Any time a person (usually a young man) drives by with boom-boom coming from the subwoofer in his trunk, practically deafening anyone within two blocks, he'd be fined $100. For the first offense. The fine would escalate rapidly until, it is hoped, the rest of us would have some peace.

The moves may seem small, but they were significant for "merger arbitrage" traders, who make short-term bets on deal stocks. In the case of the Ensco-Pride deal, the movements translated into a sudden 64% spike in the deal's "spread." That arcane measure reflects the difference between a target company's stock price and the per-share value of the acquirer's offer. The spread is closely watched by hedge funds that focus on merger arbitrage, which stand to gain or lose large sums based on the spread's movement.

When preeminent British historian John Julius Norwich tells us in the introduction to his sweeping history of the Catholic papacy that his job is to give us "a straightforward single-volume history" of the world's "most astonishing social, political, and spiritual institution ever created," he's hit the nail on the proverbial head. The centuries-old Roman papacy truly is a universally unrivaled institution, and in dense detail, Norwich's book shows us the historic playbook.

As noted, over the past several years the USM has cut more than a quarter-billion dollars from its budget. These efforts have also yielded additional savings through cost avoidance. We have honored our obligation to tighten our belt throughout this period of economic difficulty and shared sacrifice.

Likewise, Ben Affleck wasn't able to parlay critical accolades and more than $92 million in box office receipts for his Boston-set bank heist thriller "The Town" into Oscar love; the actor-director who previously won a best original screenplay statuette for 1997's "Good Will Hunting" was, like Nolan, denied a space in the best director category.

As much as she admires Bacon, whose painting and writings she returns to as a touchstone, Nelson brings her deepest critical faculties to bear on performance art or art that is performed and filmed. Key to her are pieces that involve cruelty and (usually) the female body: Yoko Ono's "Cut Piece" (1964), Marina Abramović's "Rhythm O" (1974), Catherine Opie's "Self-Portrait/Pervert" (photograph, 1994). All these pieces involve violations of the body, and Nelson examines the contradictory layers of voyeurism, violation and empowerment. Opie's "body squarely presents itself to us as bleeding, resilient, imperial, and desirous."

The Baltimore Symphony sounded bright and gritty. The violins, well unified, laid into their parts with vehemence. The lead trumpet player allowed no one in his way. The brass section, in general, could be unkind to the strings, but the group overall has an attractively open sound, the woodwinds a nice pungency. You could hear things in the score that more blended ensembles smooth over.

As for Fierstein, the only question is why it took him so long to get here. Like Bernadette Peters in "A Little Night Music," he makes you rediscover a familiar role and its anthem -- in his case, "I Am What I Am," rendered more touching than triumphant by the star's distinctive bark.
We demand equal inclusion under the law. If our opponents’ bigotry is made plain thereby, if they meet with popular censure for preaching hate and speaking with venom, so be it, for they would rather a child have one parent — or none — than two mothers. How cruel.

The biggest rains from this system came in the northwest and southeast parts of Indiana. Southwest Indiana didn't get much, which continues a trend for Evansville, which has done an about-face from the spring of 2011: The February, March and April precipitation total last year was 21.63 inches.

A safe call on a play at first base helped fuel Toronto's five-run rally and a strike call on a fastball at home plate ended the Cardinals' best chance to answer in a 6-3 loss to the Blue Jays. The Cardinals could have made a pitch or collected a hit that negated the impact of either call.
Erickson said Saturday's loss boiled down to one thing: "You're sitting there with (a 10-point lead) with12 minutes to go in the game, and they got a first down on the 6, and they end up winning the football game," Erickson said. He called it the program's most difficult loss under his watch.

quarterbacks are ultimately to be judged by championships, then Eli already has done what Peyton could not. Eli's career, buoyed by a corps of young receivers, still is in its ascent. Only now is he coming into his own, as a quarterback and a leader.

It's from all over. Other than the boots, everything's probably 5 years old. I took time off shopping to save money. I have a boy and three girls. The girls are my fashion consultants. The oldest is 13 -- they're fashionistas, for sure! I teach them that it's more creative to put pieces together that come from different places, not just off a mannequin at one store. I can't remember where I got the top, the shoes are from Charlotte Russe, the jewelry is from all over -- a piece from my sister, one from Rue 21. Wherever I am, I'll look. I'll even shop at Walmart. I don't like to look like everyone else so I rarely buy more than two pieces from one store. I like The Buckle, Gabriel Brothers, Burlington Coat Factory, Banana Republic, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. I love a bargain! I don't have much time to shop, so I just buy pieces and put things together later. I shop online and in my closet.

Even "The Cabin in the Woods," the new horror film from Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard that opened the SXSW film festival, inverted the normal fears of the genre.

Although the drugs in this case were intercepted by undercover FBI agents, Ferrer said there's a real danger to consumers from such thefts if the medicines aren't properly stored or are tampered with before re-entering the marketplace. In such cases, he said, the thieves create legitimate-sounding businesses and pose as honest distributors.
The employee was called and brought the packets back to investigators.
"Why does any duly elected commissioner have to put up with the corruption, incompetence and pettiness of the Ficano administration?" Cox said. "Does anyone here know one employee -- one employee out of our 4,300 employees -- who is proud to say they are a public servant in Wayne County?"

Fitfully illuminated and surrounded by perpetual blackness, this fragile house party might be extinguished at any moment. Time eats away at these people and their surroundings. Together they all tilt to one side, listing as if they were on a sinking ship. They grow violent, and try to strangle one another. Schumacher bites Kupferberg’s hand. Then the scenery is torn apart, with furniture turned back-to-front or upside-down, while Bos-Kroese climbs atop the door lintel. Near the end, five characters leap off-stage and haul in the dust-sheets, dragging everything toward the edge as if the room were being sucked into a black hole.

That fabulousness mesmerized Kobal. Born in Austria and raised in Canada, he eventually settled in London but made frequent visits to the United States to pursue his Hollywood obsession. In New York, he befriended actress Tallulah Bankhead, who called up her pal director George Cukor when Kobal was headed to Los Angeles for the first time in 1964. Cukor, in turn, introduced him to a panoply of actresses and actors. His entree was further enhanced by his credentials in journalism, a trade he plied for years, contributing stories to BBC Radio and various British magazines. Ultimately, though, he found his real calling.

Three sit near the stern. Two stand in the bridge above. One naps in the cabin. Each time the reels spin — signaling they’ve hooked a fish — they hope their catch is a shark. But so far, all they’ve snagged are bluefish, a toothy creature as long as a man’s arm.
Coaches don't want their players too high after victories or too low after defeats. They don't ask for emotionless robots. They want the players to feel good about winning and feel bad about losing, but they have to learn how to put it behind them and focus on the next one.

Stocks ended a choppy day Monday with a moderate rebound that sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 56 points.

Human rights activists are pressing for the public release of a Senate Intelligence Committee report on the CIA's post-Sept. 11 detention and "enhanced interrogation" practices, hoping that it will answer the question once and for all of whether torture played a role in locating Osama bin Laden.

Kiser said that anti-smoking ads and tobacco taxes grab the public's attention and trigger spikes in calls to cessation programs such as Ohio's Quit Line. Taxes and ads are especially effective in reducing smoking rates for youths and low-income populations, she said. That's important, she said, because the smoking rate of Medicaid recipients is twice the state average and Ohio Medicaid spends about $1.4 billion annually to treat smoking related disorders.
Sambora’s musical dialogue with drummer Tico Torres and synth player David Bryan has grown more sophisticated over the years: these guys really seem to respect each other, and more importantly, they listen to each other. Bryan remains the group’s not-so-secret weapon. His piano stabs, sweeping organ, and occasionally burbly synthesizer have always marked Bon Jovi as a hard rock band apart: one with a broader vision and instrumental palette than the typical Turnpike hard rockers. Bryan’s instruments were wisely mixed at the Meadowlands: just loud enough to provide color and character, but not too loud to undercut any residual claim on gruff metal authenticity the band might still have.

The company's 175 employees face an immediate financial crisis. Their health insurance ends after their last day on the job. They receive no severance pay. Their stock in the company – most employees held portfolios once valued between $75,000 and $150,000 – is probably worthless.

Despite uneven service, and the semi-charmless atmosphere, the exotic flavors and foreign spices of the food at Rudy's transported us to the Istanbul streets of Keskin's youth.

I think the big thing is he is more patient than he was earlier in the season and last year. Sometimes he gets into a rush, but whenever he has slowed down and allowed the defense to get set he's been able to have success passing as well as scoring.

But it's the traditional period pieces that best recall the noir era. Jail cells remain from the 1940s. Batons and blackjacks merit their own display case, as do gangster-period machine guns. Lurid headlines, often flanked by fingerprints and mug shots, from the period's infamous kidnappings and murders line the walls. But, in an only-in-L.A. twist, fiction mingles with fact with tributes to Jack Webb ("Dragnet" fame) and the TV show "Adam-12."

Director M. Graham Smith works hard to give each of these scenes a bit of theatrical flair, but he can't do much to breathe life into the piece's stick figures, or to draw helpful connections among the disjointed scenes.

The coaching staff. This is a write-in submission from a reader, so I added it because I can't argue. He's questioning the time management late in the game (as I did below), the problems in dealing with the Seahawks' no-huddle offense and the delay-of-game (also noted below).

While lobster is invariably an expensive restaurant item, it is way more affordable when you serve it at home. When my granddaughter Elena was 3, she ate her first lobster dipped in melted butter. She fell madly in love with it and began asking for it every week. Finally my son explained to her that lobster was for special occasions, not for the everyday family dinner. For years whenever we dined together she would ask, with hope in her voice, if the dinner was going to be a "special occasion." Thus every year we celebrate Elena's birthday with a lobster fest. This month she will be 13, truly a special occasion, and this is the lobster I will serve.
