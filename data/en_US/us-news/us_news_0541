øCritics will be quick to point out that credit ratings are subjective. And yes, the credit rating agencies failed to point out the shaky finances of companies like Enron prior to their collapse. Even so, the credit ratings are what set lending costs. These solid ratings give most of the companies in the S&P 500 access to the lowest funding costs, which also reduces their financial risk.

The Pitch? It doesn’t get more high-concept than this — Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and a bunch of cowpokes vs. angry monsters.
The awkwardness of strangers meeting for the first time melted away with an opening ice breaker of walking up to a random participant and sharing a compliment. Our master of ceremonies, Garrick, organized each day down to the minute with activities such as one-to-one conversations, themed phone calls, group projects, plays, and conversations that lasted into the wee hours of the morning. Even breakfast, lunch, and dinner were organized to pair two Spaniards with two Anglos, thus maximizing the opportunity to chat in English. The program puts no limits on topics for discussion; during the week, a very patient Spaniard taught me the steps of the Sevillana, I shared gossip about Spanish celebrities and royalty, we had several discussions comparing the political and economic systems of our two countries, and each discovered a fellow Plato enthusiast. The Spanish students were intelligent, passionate, and driven to improve their mastery of English. I was humbled by their willingness to share themselves in the process and grateful to have been part of their development.
So far police have escaped similar pressure on salaries even though they also accrue regular raises, leading one lobbyist to describe them as a protected class. Judging by median salaries, municipal police make $33,205 — or 58 percent — more than teachers. And like teachers, police are backed by powerful unions that wield political influence — and campaign checks — at the local and state level.
Investigators suspect Lind and Combe reassembled the shredded checks, which they pulled from a trash bin at Valencia Self Storage in the 27800 block of Smythe Drive, and obtained routing and bank account numbers to produce more than 30 counterfeit checks, which they negotiated in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys in Los Angeles County and Simi Valley in Ventura County, Rohrbach said.
"Katie's hit right there was huge," Jukkala said. "Sometimes it's hard to ask a kid to do everything, with what she does on the mound too, but that's the kid who you want to do it because she works so hard to do it.

The new Datsuns will be small, inexpensive cars without the power and amenities of Nissan’s other brands. To sell such vehicles under the Nissan name could hurt the reputation of the parent brand, he said.
It does get a little bit cold. We still need to get some big area rugs. My 2-year-old is a handful, so the cleanup factor is going to be easier on the tile. Plus, we have animals - two dogs and a cat, so in terms of sweeping up hair, the tile is easier.

And there is hidden treasure: pockets of 30-year-old vines dating back to what viticulturist Prudy Foxx, the area's resident vine whisperer, calls a "a smattering of interest in growing in this area" in the late 1970s - mostly Chardonnay, a touch of Merlot. With help from Foxx and others, the vineyards are being fine-tuned, given a chance to prove that they can perform along with California's best.

Charles Vitale (1922-2006) wrote in “Your Town Kenilworth” (1957) that the “beautiful hills” of Kenilworth that made up the local landscape were aptly named Galloping Hill “for it was down these same ‘hills’ the train robbers galloped to hold up the Rahway Valley Railroad during the filming of some of the earliest motion pictures. If you doubt this just keep your TV set tuned to the Late, Late, Late Show.”

"Often times with a changing climate, it’s something that happens in little fits and starts and can kind of sneak up on you," Robinson said. "That can be dangerous. Whenever you get a big storm, what’s the first reaction? It’s, ‘Let’s rebuild, rebuild stronger.’ Is that the right answer? I’m not going to pass judgment. It’s a very, very difficult, contentious subject and one that will be with us for a long while."
A remake seemed kind of unnecessary (even though Carpenter himself was remaking a movie from 30 years before, 1951's "The Thing from Another World"), but it turns out that 2011's "The Thing" is actually a sly little prequel to Carpenter's movie.

Coldplay, despite its popularity, is also plenty unpopular, and could have made the list. Then again, unpopular isn't the same as hate. "Meh" isn't "#$%! those guys." Still, with one ad-libbed from Seth Rogen to Paul Rudd in the "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," it became totally acceptable to slag Coldplay. "The Big Lebowski" did the same thing to the Eagles.

While law enforcement dug in on the criminal investigation, child welfare officials had their own crisis to manage.
Before connecting for his first homer for the Halos, Pujols already has altered his new club dramatically. He's sold tickets and merchandise. He's raised the Angels' profile and their expectations. And, as one of the most feared hitters of his generation, Pujols has given them a frightful presence in the middle of their lineup. Mark Trumbo didn't mind being kicked off first base and moved to third to make room for Pujols.
Under the old gerrymandered maps, an up-and-coming incumbent senator such as Lizbeth Benacquisto, a former Wellington councilwoman, wouldn't have to relocate to Fort Myers to stay in office.

But on Thursday night, New Jersey slept under a blanket of snow. And he was singing not for revelers in a football stadium, but to a sold-out house at the relatively intimate Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, on behalf of a charity meant to assist the impoverished. So he turned the song inside out, substituting acoustic guitars for the distorted six-strings that are Bon Jovi’s preferred method of pop-hook delivery, and trading the fist-pumping refrain for a low-key arrangement that felt ruminative and maybe even spiritual.
James said he has been limited to conditioning work in practice thus far, and that a brace is being made for the injured elbow.

A: Hey, Andy: Again, I will say that a quarterback has to be evaluated on his individual skills -- his arm, his ability to function in the pocket, his ability to see the field and read defenses, his ability to anticipate routes and place the ball where it needs to be. I'm not sure the Browns need another season to make judgments on those skills. I think Shurmur will hire an offensive coordinator. It remains to be seen whether the new job will include play-calling duties or if Shurmur will maintain those for himself.

Sumner did not lambaste Mayle in the same fashion he did Nilsson.

Alexander called a potential Amazon tablet a game changer. Amazon already has services such as the Amazon Android App store that allows customers to buy software for tablets and smart phones and the Amazon Instant Video service that allows buyers to download movies and television programs.

Since Mike Martz was fired in the middle of 2005, the Rams have gone through two other head coaches and two interim ones. And what do they have to show for it?

In year's past, Democrat Days has attracted national stars on the way up -- U.S. Sen. Joe Biden in 1983, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton in 1992 -- or still in their prime, though John Edwards' 2005 appearance is seen through a different light today.

"It's great that people in Detroit are excited about me," Castellanos said Tuesday in a telephone interview from Lakeland. "But everyone needs to stay patient, especially me. The worst thing you can do is rush yourself, whether it's at the plate during an at-bat or if it's your development timetable. Everyone worries about the 'when,' when the focus should be on what you're doing every day to make yourself better."

In 2009, Presti rented his cap space again, this time to the Utah Jazz, a club that was looking to avoid the luxury tax. The Thunder absorbed Matt Harpring, who had sustained a career-ending injury and his insured $6.5 million salary, to snatch point guard Eric Maynor in return.

For my inaugural "Blowing Off Steam" rant, I thought I'd zero in on the segment's namesake, Steam. You see, in theory, Steam is great. It saves me from doing things like leaving the house, finding a place with a good selection of PC/Mac games, and purchasing them from an unsavory clerk. It also saves me waiting two horrific days for Amazon to send me my loot. However, you reap what you sow. It's like an RPG quest, in that you actually have to leave the village and clear out the cave if you really want the reward. Even though I "own" the games I buy on Steam (and its nice that I can install them on multiple systems), I never really feel like I do. Besides the fact that I have no physical evidence of my ownership, I can't escape the feeling that Steam is like a friend who sets you up on a blind date with a really attractive person, but insists on tagging along every single time you go out. This meddling approach, coupled with the fact that my account has been hacked numerous times as part of the ever-worsening security breach at Valve, leads me to feel like there has to be a better way. EA's competing service, Origin, looks to be built on a very similar model. I suppose I may just have to go clear the cave myself.

4. Don't make them travel too far. Remember: It's a wedding, not a marathon. If you're holding the ceremony at a place of worship and the reception at a separate venue, keep the driving distance between the two locations limited (15-20 minutes max).

Previous investigations had determined that the Guardsmen wheeled and fired spontaneously, even though they were not at imminent risk. Some Guardsmen claimed to have heard an order to fire.

If you're OK with that, you probably enjoyed Monday night's game. It wasn't, by any means, a flawless exhibition of basketball. You could tell that Kentucky scraped by at least partially on talent, not on some form of telepathic connection built up over three or four years of playing college ball together. The Wildcats were simply the most talented group of players in the country, expertly molded in the way they needed to be in the time given.

After setting up their final draft board a few days ago, Fisher and Snead thought they could find the sort of players with the three picks in Round 2 who were not only good enough to start for the Rams next season (really now, how hard is it to find someone to start for a team that has won only 15 games over the past five seasons?), but also talented enough to become the kind of players who could start for the best teams in the NFL.

Other than the quite terrific backyard burger, burgers can be hit and miss. Ida's Old School Burger is grass-fed beef with cheddar, pickles, tomato, griddled onion and a smoky-sweet secret sauce. It's classic, except for the soft ribbons of onions, but quite a bit drier than Nancy's burger. That's the trade-off with grass-fed: It's leaner and has a more subtle flavor than grain-fed beef.
Mr. Hu, the activist, said Mr. Chen suffered a leg injury during his escape while climbing over a wall around his home. He struggled for 20 hours to reach a rendezvous point, where volunteers picked him up and drove him to Beijing, moving him from safe house to safe house, Mr. Hu said.

Roddy Doyle has written novels, screenplays and short stories. He is well-loved for his dry humor which, in this story collection, seems more often to ignite doubt and light the path to despair than in the novels. Happiness is the theme of many of the 13 stories, the best kind of happiness, happiness with everyday life. In the title story, the narrator's greatest joy has been in raising his four sons. As they leave home one by one, a great chasm opens up in his life. On holiday and drinking with the lads, he finds himself at a bullfight and watches as the bull is set on fire. Doyle never tells a reader what to think and so preserves the sense of wonder and interpretation that is pure oxygen to the story form. Like his fellow countryman James Joyce, he follows his characters down streets and through thoughts, stalking happiness, struggling to look forward, held back by strange memories and insisting on simplicity and the beauty, the delicious luxury of routine.
Heritage House was among countless facilities that kept its residents in substandard conditions. In 1975, three years after Ruiz moved there, Presbyterian minister and civil rights activist Wade Blank spirited him and other residents to apartments at a Denver housing project.

As flashbacks reveal how she fell under the spell of the group's charismatic leader (John Hawkes), director Sean Durkin adroitly relates the difficulty she has readjusting to so-called ordinary life while staying with her older sister (Sarah Paulson) in Connecticut.

The next step is to go back to where we started and make phones stop being phones and start becoming PDAs. Take, for instance, the new Nokia N810, a delightful little tablet-y thing that is not, in itself, a phone. But it will connect, via Bluetooth, to one. In fact, when you get it out of the box, that's more or less the first thing it does. So now, with devices like this, you'll be able to write emails, browse the Web, do all the things you now do on your phone, but on a screen that's twice the size, and on a keyboard that doesn't give you finger cramps. In other words, we're going back to the PDA but marrying it to the connectivity we didn't have in those days. We just won't call them PDAs anymore. It was a stupid name anyway.

At the outset of her campaign, Whitman stated that she needed to win over Latinos and outperform typical GOP candidates in that community to win.

Choose a place with history - where you had your first date, got engaged, celebrated something wonderful.

Ask the restaurant's wine guru to choose something very special for you. Tonight, they'll actually have time to do it.

Gov. Rick Snyder and state Superintendent Mike Flanagan issued a joint news release late Thursday, pledging that the state will enforce a controversial bill that recently passed the Legislature -- and awaits Snyder's signature -- that would allow an expansion of the number of cyber charter schools that can open in Michigan and the number of students who can enroll in them.

Still, Harborplace needs to appeal to tourists, and Ripley's will help lure visitors, Fowler said.
We all know it. Nobody is saying it. And while the team requires Oden to sit on the bench during the games, and to do his contractually obligated NBA appearances, I don't think Blazers fans would mind a bit if the organization excused him from the rest of the season and sent him home.
The 227,000-square-foot-building, scheduled to open in about a year, will be next to the pharmacy benefit manager's automated mail-order drug distribution plant that opened in June at the NorthPark business park.
The comments shocked global markets and dragged down both the euro and the Hungarian forint on Friday and Monday. Hungary has since tried to backpedal, with Economy Minister Gyorgy Matolcsy saying Monday that his government would strive to meet the 2010 budget deficit target of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product set by the previous administration.
Over the next six months, he'll visit 14 cities worldwide. And he's gotten sponsors to pay for his trips: Sarcoma Alliance, Sarcoma Foundation of America and Ziopharm Oncology, which is testing a drug to treat sarcoma.

At Heavy Seas Alehouse, general manager Vince Cassino says the goal was to offer their customers a new way to try their beers — the cocktails include after-dinner beer cocktails, any-time drinks and some summery tiki-style cocktails — and also to appeal to those who aren't familiar with craft beers.
“I think it’s a thin organization in a number of areas. There may be a good reason for that. I want to take time to learn that. I’m not coming in with any preconceptions.”
Not all of it is his fault. O'Neal is a liability he tried to cover up all year but ultimately failed. Williams is a liability Brown tried to hide but couldn't. And Jamison on Garnett is a no-win that Brown tried to stop with a series of bizarre Band-aids that came off as desperate. None of it worked. The defensive coach's defense let him down. He's probably going to be fired because of it, among other things.
Curry said he wanted to personally appear in court because he considered the crime so grave.
Finally: Jason Kipnis leads the Tribe with three homers.
Er--literacy isn't learned in a university. Literacy is learned in primary and secondary education. The inability of the state government of Florida to adequately fund a state constitution mandate to provide a public primary and secondary education is where this begins.
Property owners would pay $2 per $1,000 of assessed property value for each of the next six years. That comes out to about $300 a year on the typical home in the district, assessed at $143,000.
Stokley re-signed with the Broncos last month and has been training with the team ever since. He said he's noticed no difference in Manning's demeanor here than when they were teammates in Indianapolis from 2003-2006.
Mix flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl (or the bowl of an upright mixer) with a rubber spatula. Rub in butter with your hands until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the chocolate chips. Gradually pour in the eggs, and using a handheld mixer (or the paddle attachment if using the stand mixer) beat on lowest speed just until the eggs are blended into the ingredients.
Noticing people running past, they quickly left money on the table and walked outside to the concourse. By the time Kelly got outside the building, the scene reminded her of a ticker-tape parade as paper rained down from the north tower.
A major staffing company recently reported that more than a million job vacancies currently exist. Realizing that job location and skills required may cause limitations, it would still appear that about 8 percent of those unemployed might find work.
That would be terribly unfair if health status were permanently fixed or entirely under our control. But it's not. Yes, you should exercise and watch what you eat. But the fact is that, even if you do, you're going to get older. The older you get, the more likely you are to get sick.
“I’ll probably have to go to Rahway or Newark,” he said outside the Elizabeth office. “It’s packed as it is – it will probably be twice as packed.”
The pages in "Book" aren't numbered ("Shuffled is how it is supposed to go," the composer said). And there is "no linear evolution" from piece to piece; each stands alone. But there is some shared DNA, so to speak; the composer, using tracing paper, transferred the outline of certain melodic contours from score to score.
The trade group of purchasing managers said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 53.4 in March, up from a February reading of 52.4. Readings above 50 indicate manufacturing is expanding.
"The behavior resonated with everyone," Carroll said.
One place where cruise lines move quickly is in shoring up their own defense, Deehl notes. "They have their own civil defense lawyers who are often flown right to the ship to interview crew and passengers immediately, locking in their defense theories with sworn testimony," he told me.
"I think he's probably as committed as he's ever been in his career," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said this week, asked to summarize James' season. "And he's always been committed. We all respond to his energy on the court."
LaDuke scheduled five visits. He was to visit USC, UCLA, Nebraska, BYU and ASU. LaDuke took visits to BYU, ASU and UCLA, but did not visit the other two schools.
In the past, I’d always traveled trains by coach, but Lindy has a bad back, so she sprang for a sleeper. Lindy said the cabin was tiny, with no room for a suitcase or even tote bag.
Centene and United Healthcare should not be disqualified simply because they are out-of-state or for-profit companies. But we do see a high burden of proof on any company -- local or out-of-state, new or old -- that wants to be a coordinated care organization in Oregon.
Hayes was set to be sentenced May 22, but “he was probably going to get probation. It wasn’t a big deal,’’ Gunn said.
"We've spent over 12 years building our reputation, brand, and trust with our customers," Hsieh said in his email. "It's painful to see us take so many steps back due to a single incident. I suppose the one saving grace is that the database that stores our customers' critical credit card and other payment data was not affected or accessed."
Blue Jackets 2, Blues 1 ... with 3:45 left in regulation.
NBC carries the Vikes-Eagles contest and ESPN has tonight's key NFC South New Orleans-Atlanta game, both national telecasts. Neither NFL nor NBC officials would divulge whether NBC would have been limited to showing the Eagles-Vikes game only in the regions of the participating teams if it had been rescheduled for tonight. That's what CBS and Fox are limited to doing when one of their games is moved from a Sunday to Monday, per ESPN's deal.
As a policy adviser with the Environmental Defense Fund recently admitted in The Wall Street Journal, "Groundwater pollution incidents that have come to light to date have all been caused by well construction problems," not the fracking process.
Some of the big industries we do have aren't doing especially well. The health and education sector shrank slightly in St. Louis last year even as it grew 2 percent nationally.
The 92.3% figure has been criticized by a number of independent fact checkers, including Politifact – which rated the claim “mostly false.” Politifact noted that the Romney campaign calculated the figure by using employment data spanning four years, including Obama’s first month in office in January of 2009, when the economy was still losing jobs that began to disappear under former President George W. Bush. Job losses were higher for women during that period because many men had already lost their jobs and many women followed.
Greta's closed in 2000, but by then, Thiemann had become adept around the kitchen. He'd never really mulled a culinary career, but the hand skills he'd developed as a drummer and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk rock gave him an edge with cooking.
McCarty said “the road” is so much nicer today than in the '60s.
Bales, an employee of a Seattle-area marketing and public relations company, has cared for two young children during her husband’s time at war.

Levine's energy was tremendous -- and besides being a doctor and traveling to places like Kenya and the Congo each year for his research, he found time to write a novel, "The Blue Notebook." The book, which featured a cover blurb by Khaled Hosseini, author of the best seller "The Kite Runner," told the story of child prostitution in Mumbai and was narrated by a young girl trying to survive it.

Whatever. Maybe just a bad day. But when I returned to LAX on Saturday to rent my son a car from Avis -- unlike Budget, it rents to drivers under 25 -- we ran into the same thing. Twenty people in line. Two people at the counter. Thirty minutes down the drain.

It is, in fact, the paperback that has made our era a reader's paradise. From Oxford World Classics, I can get "The Female Quixote." From the University Press of the Pacific, I can get Ivan Goncharov's "The Same Old Story." Madame de Lafayette's "The Princess of Cleves" is available from at least five publishers, while New York Review Books Classics offers any number of enticing reprints. Just this fall, in fact, the press has put out its "10th Anniversary Complete Collection," which, for a retail price of $3,943.40, includes 250 titles such as "The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren" by Iona Opie and "The Unknown Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac. At a book a week, I will never read them all, but I want them.
Former congressman Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate, has boasted of standing up to Bush on Medicare spending while in Congress.

Cost is a key factor in getting businesses and homeowners to convert to solar power. A typical residential roof setup costs about $25,000, which federal, state and local rebates and tax incentives can cut to about $13,000 in the city of Los Angeles. At that price, it still could take about a dozen years for the systems to pay back the upfront costs through lower electricity bills.

The songwriting credit was initally given to Ethel Smith (Diddley's wife). Now the song is credited to Ellis McDaniel (Diddley's real name) and Baker. The "Love Is Strange" case wound up in litigation, and in November, 1961, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Williams, who was represented by Gene Goodman, the brother of jazz cat Benny Goodman.

Apathy + anger = ? Even as voters continue to fulminate at politicians and their policies, Tuesday's turnout hovered in the low 20-percent range. Part of the problem is the dearth of competition - voters simply don't have enough choices. In the primary only four senators and 28 House members had challengers. Even the two incumbent congressional losses were as much a result of decennial redistricting as of genuine competition.

"The funniest thing is that every album I've done and every band I've been in have been happy accidents, including this one," says White, speaking from his home in Nashville. "If you just write songs and don't tell them what to be — don't tell the song to be a country song or a rock `n' roll song — then it becomes what it needs to be in the end."
Former Ravens cornerback Chris Carr, who was released before the start of free agency, spent yesterday in Kansas City meeting with Chiefs officials and he reportedly will be in Minnesota today to talk to the Vikings.

For several years, he had been looking for the relevant biochemistry for why people interrupt their sleep and stop breathing - sleep apnea - a very dangerous condition contributing to heart attacks and post-surgery death, and in less extreme cases, disturbing the good night's rest of some 20 million Americans (and their spouses). Over breakfast, he was chatting with his friend Solomon Snyder, winner of the Lasker Prize for discovering opiate receptors in the brain, essentially the whole way pleasure and pain work.

samples were taken almost entirely on grass seed land, the abundance and variety of fish found could be considered an indirect indication of relatively good water quality and working ecosystems, Giannico said. That's good news for farmers whose land borders rivers and must deal with concerns about agricultural runoff, he said.

Babby is aware of criticism that the Suns erred by not trading Nash this season, thereby getting some value for him rather than see him walk away as a free agent. The Suns' executive, a former sports agent for the likes of Tim Duncan and Grant Hill, said that by not trading him, the team got the benefit of another season at which Nash played at a high level. Left unsaid was the fact that there was no way the Suns would get anything close to high value in such a deal.

We mention that because Anne Carey, supervisor of the Wayne National Forest, was concerned about fracking’s impact on the Wayne National Forest. She recommended that the forest be removed from the Dec. 7 federal auction until there could be further review.

A Wayne National Forest already allows for other drilling -- and there are 1,300 shallow wells there -- but fracking could require removing far more trees, according to The Columbus Dispatch.

If there can be progress in better managing the Missouri River, it must be an open process that involves all constituencies, not just the eight basin states, but also the Native American tribes in the upper basin, the farmers who till the river bottomland and the environmentalists who seek to protect endangered species nearly wiped out by poor conservation practices of the past.

Instead, they see a 6-6, 245-pound white guy with a shaved head, a guy who -- out of uniform at this time of year -- is likely to be seen in shorts with white socks pulled nerdishly high.

While Brown said the advantage in those early years was "literally no pressure," because basketball was such a non-factor, he remembered how his team had to ride an old, noisy yellow school bus with no heat to the airport for road games.

Her paper cited statistics: "Alarmingly, nearly 5.3 million United States women are victims of domestic violence each year, resulting in 2 million injuries and 1,300 deaths." She described the cycle of domestic abuse: 1) the tension-building phase which "may be accompanied by minor assaults" during which time "the woman believes she can deflect her husband's bullying by conceding to her husband's wishes;" 2) "the battering episode. ... At this point the man is out of control and acts in a rage;" 3) "the reconciliation period. Here the batterer transforms himself into a very apologetic, tender and loving character."

When he was finished, it didn't take long for chatter within social media circles to begin and granted, while it may not be as bad as Rosanne Barr's infamous rendition in 1990, we have to say that for a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, it left us feeling very 'meh...' And yes, we realize that Tyler is a rock star and may not approach it with the same vocal finesse as Whitney Houston (who delivered this classic rendition). Still, rockers can tastefully sing the anthem from time to time. Need proof? Check out Chris Daughtry and Poison frontman Bret Michaels.

So we still see the joggers, the bicyclists and the hikers. We still barbecue, because that's what people are supposed to do in the summer. We still walk the dog, who is probably wishing we didn't.

I lost my dad 18 months before filming, so having an opportunity to see that every single one of the caregivers on the show was one I would hire for my dad was a very touching and amazing thing.
"If I were a prosecutor, one punch is enough for a murder charge," Kling said. "He probably didn't intend to kill, which brings it down to involuntary manslaughter. My argument would be that a 6-foot, 3-inch guy knows that a punch to the head can cause great bodily harm.''

øSuch commentaries, including Smith's letter, should not be lost on investors. When evaluating people who are managing their money, investors need to be mindful of whether the managers are true fiduciaries, or commissioned to serve in the best interest of their clients, Hebner says. You need to understand the relationship you have with your money manager and insure your well-being is their responsibility. If not, you might want to look elsewhere, he says. "Brokerage firms have clauses that exempt them from being a fiduciary. It's just incredible," he says.
