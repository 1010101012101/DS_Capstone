I adored her scene in the clap clinic, when, feet in stirrups, she shares her warped world view with the world-weary clinician, who says, "You couldn't pay me enough to be 24 again." Amen, sister. Were we really that immature at that age?
Washington pays tribute to his native country with poutine ($10), a Canadian specialty that should be designated the official dish for any actor who has to pack on a lot of weight in a short time. (Are you listening, John Travolta, Renee Zellweger and Forest Whitaker?)
“It’s nice,” Shakespeare said of his familiar role. “I played a little offensive middie in my sophomore year, and then kind of made the transition. The team needed me as a short-stick defensive middie last year, and I just do what the team needs. This fall, I worked real hard in the offseason to hone the offensive skills, and it’s good to get out there and get a few goals. It felt good.”

The Warriors doubled Rose off most pick-and-roll sets and usually had the other three defenders ready to help. The scheme left Carlos Boozer open for some of his 21 points and gave Luol Deng a chance to score 18, but Rose, the Bulls' conductor, was completely out of tune.

"Wild ginger," Terri advises, her botanical street cred bolstered by native-flora artwork she'd seen on Maui. Man-high curtains of green with fiery red spires choke both sides of the road. My savvy stops at the eucalyptus and raspberry brambles, stuff I know from home. Hawaii is thick with exotic, invasive species like these berries and gum trees, and some are true banes. A vine noses out, studded with gorgeous purple-blue flowers, and I capture it in 15-megapixel mega-glory. I rue that it's probably one of those unwanted invaders from elsewhere. (Sadly, it is.) Forty-five minutes later, we've not even reached the trail proper as we gape and guess at all the chlorophyllery.

2 Wildlife killings: The Great Depression-era program the Department of Agriculture uses to kill coyotes, mountain lions and other predators that threaten livestock is outdated, illegal and a waste of federal money, conservationists said in a lawsuit filed this week in federal court in Reno. The Wildlife Services agency has refused for nearly two decades to conduct the environmental reviews to justify the mass killings with traps, snares, poisons and aerial gunning, lawyers for WildEarth Guardians, based in Sante Fe, N.M., said.
Prices are excellent too, especially compared with those of other steakhouses. At Morton's you pay more than $50 for a steak; at Alfred's it's likely to be in the low 30s, plus you get to pick a side at no extra cost. A baked potato or creamed spinach from the Chicago chain is $10 or $12 respectively; at Alfred's they're $4 if you'd like more than one side.

A source said Rams quarterback Sam Bradford's name came up when the Browns were trying to move up to No. 2, but that it was in passing and never got anywhere. The Rams would take a huge cap hit if they traded Bradford, and the Browns would've had to pay Bradford's enormous salary. Over the next four years, his base salaries are $12 million, $9 million, $14.015 million, and $12.985 million. There's even more money in escalators and bonuses.
Those changes provided some of the inspiration for Tom Lutz, an author, professor of creative writing at UC Riverside and founder of the site, which offers reviews, essays and interviews with authors.

About the Pistons: The Pistons lost 98-81 to the Memphis Grizzlies Friday night in Detroit as Mike Conley finished with 14 points, 11 assists, four rebounds and four steals. ... It was Detroit's fourth loss in a row and 10th in the last 11 games. ... They have not scored 100 or more points this season and have been held below 90 points 12 times in 16 games. ... They are 2-4 at home. ... One bright spot has been the play of Monroe. He had a career-high 32 points and season-high 16 rebounds at Milwaukee Jan. 12. It was the first time a Detroit starting center has scored 30 or more points since Rasheed Wallace had 36 against Chicago in 2007. Monroe joined Dennis Rodman and Grant Hill as the only Pistons to have at least 32 points and 16 rebounds in one game over the last 22 years. Monroe ranks among the top three among second-year players in points, rebounds, field goal shooting percentage and free throw shooting percentage. ... Knight, a rookie, had 22 points and four assists in the loss to Memphis.

Meanwhile, the Rams expect defensive end and team captain James Hall (chest) to return to the lineup Saturday in Pittsburgh after missing the Cincinnati game Sunday.
Jeff Zrebiec, Ravens beat reporter: As usual with the Ravens, there was a lot to like about their draft haul. To get Courtney Upshaw in the second round while also acquiring another pick was a huge coup. You can bet that there was a lot of head shaking going on around NFL war rooms that another potential impact defensive player had fallen into the Ravens' laps. Bernard Pierce and Tommy Streeter also have a lot of athleticism and upside. Perhaps my expectations were a little too high, but I thought the Ravens would come out of the draft with an offensive lineman whom they could immediately pencil in as a starter, and a wide receiver who would immediately play a prominent role. I'm not sure you could say that about guard Kelechi Osmele, who some scouts feel has a lot of question marks, or about Streeter. Director of player development Eric DeCosta acknowledged that not everything broke the Ravens' way, and I'd imagine part of the front office's frustration stems from the fact that several of their top receiver targets didn't make it to them. But overall, the Ravens filled a couple of needs and added plenty of depth, two of their established goals. Grade: B.
"The hardest part is just learning the scheme," Mathis said. "I can run routes, I can catch the ball, that's not a problem. It's learning where to break down my routes, what route to run, who to block, things like that."

The state's Republican-controlled Legislature recently passed a bill that will independently audit the state's managed-care companies. It's a good step, but the audits won't begin until 2014. That's a long time to wait for independent answers about whether the state has systematically overpaid plans and whether the recently announced $73 million in givebacks by Minnesota's big plans is sufficient.

Rather than have to answer such questions, I'd prefer to let the market run its course. Yes, newspapers employ fewer reporters than they used to, and that's not good in a democracy that depends on the press to hold public officials accountable. It's too early to know whether online publications, like ProPublica at the national level and the St. Louis Beacon at the local level, will be able to fill the gap.

Romney still has the most money, and has collected the most endorsements from people who thought him the probable nominee. He deployed that money effectively for negative advertising that overwhelmed Newt Gingrich in Florida. But Romney has been unable to offer a positive reason why he should be the Republican nominee.

The lawsuit alleges that attorneys and volunteers who conducted a "painstaking line-by-line" review of signatures and found they "fell far short." I believe this case must be heard. It would be a tragedy for our democracy if a small group of people were to overturn a hard-fought and won victory for young children of immigrants.

Melatonin is the naturally occurring hormone that regulates sleep on a 24-hour cycle. Normally, melatonin levels start rising two to three hours before the onset of sleepiness. Sunlight interferes with melatonin production, however, and can disrupt that cycle. The same team reported earlier this year, for example, that preventing exposure of teens to bright lights in the morning could cause a 30-minute delay in sleep onset, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness.

In other ways, it's a slightly odd fit. "I always considered the record company the enemy, to be honest with you," Was said last month, over dinner at a New York City restaurant. "In my experience they were people who didn't do what they said they were going to do. And now that I come in there, half of the things I see, I think, 'Oh, that's why it's got to be done that way.' Certain things that were incomprehensible and seemed evil make total sense. And then the other half is: 'Maybe it doesn't have to be this way. Maybe we can approach this from a fresh point of view.' So maybe that's what we should focus on."

"Consumer-technology products," he declares in the opening essay, originally delivered at Kenyon College's 2011 commencement, "are … great enablers of narcissism. Alongside their built-in eagerness to be liked is a built-in eagerness to reflect well on us. Our lives look a lot more interesting when they're filtered through the sexy Facebook interface."

But I can actually put all of my rings on my fingers, except I really can’t get it on my thumb. It’s a little loose on my baby finger, but the big ring I have to put on that finger. The biggest is the first one I won here (in 2001). That’s the biggest one that I was measured for. But my fingers go up and down, especially when you get off the airplane.”

For instance, the liberal rabbi whom I thought was out to undermine Jewish tradition and herald assimilation turned out to be someone of deep faith and integrity, trying to the best of their ability and with good intentions, to engage the Jewish people in religious life and values, caring much more about Jewish tradition than I had imagined.

It also includes bankruptcy: Let those who stand to gain from the risks they take—lenders, borrowers and bank executives—also remain accountable for mistakes. As for regulation, the U.S. may want to look to London for ideas. In the last decade, the U.K. equivalent of the Securities Exchange Commission (called the Financial Services Authority) fired much of its staff and hired back higher-caliber talent, at higher salaries. This reduced the motivation for regulators to jump to more lucrative private sector jobs and improved the understanding between banks and regulators.
The liberals' problem with such interrogation begins with their insistence that terrorists be treated as ordinary criminals rather than enemy combatants.

Although federal law required PG&E to consider any previous longitudinal seam failures or leaks when it picked a pipe inspection method, there is no evidence the company ever found original documentation to rule out bad seam welds as a cause of any of the San Bruno line's leaks.

Our fair city, which hosted the Olympic Trials in 2000 and 2004, may be nearly three times larger than Eugene and much more metropolitan.
