In the mid-1970s, she began to focus less on music and more on feminism and her own stunning brand of liberation politics, becoming an editor and writer at the Village Voice and later founding the Cultural Reporting and Criticism program at NYU. Her writing is rigorous, unrelenting, in your face: not in the sense of mindless provocation but because she was so smart.

Given the inherent unfairness of the Blues' schedule, this will be a difficult assignment for the visitors.

Eleven years of losing to George Washington is over for Manhattan Center.
Our Founding Fathers entrusted the president with an extraordinary power — the ability to grant clemency in the form of pardons (which restore civil rights) and commutations (which reduce unjust or excessive sentences) to federal offenders. In almost every state, the governor is given the power to pardon or commute the sentences of those who have broken state laws. It is a highly respected responsibility and duty of the office. In effect, it allows a duly elected executive to balance the scales of justice, when appropriate.

The Vikings hold the No. 3 pick and, with time to kill, speculation will run rampant about their intentions until they officially submit their choice on April 26. The safe bet remains that they'll take Southern California left tackle Matt Kalil, a wonderful talent at a position of dire need for the Vikings.

No less than a dozen slot parlors and video gaming terminals have popped up recently in the Lehigh Valley, the Poconos, Yonkers, N.Y., and Delaware, building something of wall around the Jersey resort.

If you're expecting to hear the story of the Trojan horse, you won't find it here any more than you do in Homer's "The Iliad." In "An Iliad" as well as in "The Iliad," the Greek warrior hero Achilles and the Trojan warrior hero Hector take center stage. Certainly, both Homer's Achilles and his Hector, especially the former, seem to be driven by inordinate shares of testosterone, and the thousands of soldiers who man both the Greek and the Trojan armies of Homer's tale are equally prone to violent deeds of anger and retribution, but, then again, what does one expect in war.

It's why I get angry when I see a hockey player named Shea Weber intentionally smash a defenseless opponent's head into the glass twice during a brawl in a playoff game. It looked like something scripted out in pro wrasslin', when the villain bashes the good guy's head into the turnbuckle. But this wasn't make-believe. This was real life and it was dangerous and disgusting and I still don't understand why Weber was only fined $2,500, the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement, for that vicious hit on Detroit forward Henrik Zetterberg.

When I started writing this column in 2009, almost every trade group in Washington told me that the FAA bill was the single most important piece of legislation for the travel industry. Setting aside for a moment the teensy fact that our preferred method of transportation is the car, the bill's long-delayed approval raises two key questions. First, how did travelers fare amid all the legislative horse-trading? And second, are passengers adequately represented in Washington today?

Each dish was paired with exceptional wine. Van Waerebeek did not disagree with Zac's assessment of Chilean dining; Chile lacks a thriving restaurant culture of, say, France. Home cooking is another story, especially when the home belongs to Van Waerebeek.

Altogether, the analysis included 316 head-to-head comparisons.

The exportation of innovation is not limited to academic medical institutions. It's at the core of what we in the medical technology industry do every day -- collaborating with leading physicians, applying our expertise and creating new devices and therapies to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life around the world.
It is troubling to see our elected officials and their cronies dictate what is best for the masses, similar to Native Americans being advised that life on reservations would afford them a better lifestyle. Passage of the referendum will eventually lead to unaffordable residency in Hopewell Township. I urge everyone to vote “no” May 8.
The celebration is divided into three times: 1:30 to 3 p.m. with a music assembly followed by a birthday parade; 3:30 to 5 p.m. with a reception and tours; 5-6:30 p.m. with a light meal and Central School historical trivia.

What's with this behavior? How can professionals get so upset they harm themselves? Sports psychologists say it can happen in the high-pressure world of winning and losing, with people who identify themselves with their performance and, frankly, are supposed to be aggressive.
They were lively, energetic affairs. St.Clair and the orchestra would provide a single chord, an aural carpet upon which one of the Shams' musicians would improvise and rhapsodize for a spell. A rugged allegro would ensue, heavily accented, metrically intricate and headlong. The strummed tanburs, hard-edged, stood out nicely against the orchestral background. The percussion juiced the pieces vivaciously, sometimes raucously. The music had the feeling of a celebratory jam session and was applauded by the audience in a like way.
The president took note of the agreement he signed with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday that shifts security to the Afghan people. He reminded the American public, once again, of the military raid that killed Osama bin Laden a year ago.
On top of the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, Signal Hill has been linked to early American Indian tribes. Today, it includes dozens of homes, some dating to 1904, set on several secluded blocks whose streets are divided by broad, grassy medians.

A. Palms have an extensive root system and grinding down of the stump is going to leave a lot of the palm behind. It's likely not what you want to do, but the remaining stump portion after the grinding is best dug out. Otherwise, the new palm is going to have to compete with the remaining root portions and eventually rotting palm portions.
I want to talk about criticism, about what it is and how it operates: an issue that was one of the abiding passions of John Leonard's career. And not just criticism as a form of service journalism (although, in part, that too) but criticism as an expression of social and cultural engagement, a function of political or literary life. It's no coincidence that on the day before he died — of lung cancer, at age 69 — Leonard spent hours waiting to vote for Barack Obama for president. "Whatever else he's done or failed to do," he wrote in a 1991 review of Norman Mailer's novel "Harlot's Ghost," "… Mailer — our very own Knight-Errant, Don Quixote, Tripmaster Monkey, Zapata, and Scaramouche — has at last made the political personal." Leonard may as well have been talking about himself.
"Of course he had. He always bounced back and kept on playing," she said in a phone interview. "He's a warrior. That didn't stop him. I don't know what football player hasn't. It's not ballet. It's part of the game."

Making his case for re-election, Obama said the nation must restore a sense of security for hard-working Americans and stand for a government willing to help those in hard times. The Democratic president blasted Republicans by name and said the choice between the parties is "unambiguously clear."
We know Jordan is a hedonist.
She said Rendfrey, who faces murder charges, told her there would be no fingerprints on Paranzino because "he wore gloves" and he "staged the body and made it look like she had been doing drugs. He positioned the needle in her arm, left her in her room and then went through the apartment (taking jewelry and other items) and left."

More troubling, a record 43.7 percent of today's unemployed workers are taking more than six months to land another job.
Of course the "Twilight" films would become a blockbuster franchise. Of course Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner would become heartthrobs, their pictures on posters adorning half the bedroom walls of tweens everywhere. Of course the series would prove so popular, with the first three films making almost $790 million combined, that the studio making them would split the last installment into two parts, taking a cue from "Harry Potter."
And it can be used when you'd rather the man at the plate didn't walk. (Sorry, I know that concept just gave a gaggle of metric fans a heart attack, but it's why pitchers work around hitters  the next guy has worse odds.) If the man on-deck is not going to be replaced by a pinch-hitter and the manager doesn't like his chances of driving in a run, the manager may try to get his hot hitter a crack at a middle-middle fastball. I've got no clue what Ned thought of Alcides Ecobar's chances (he struck out), but having the man at the plate put the ball in play is sometimes the better option.
The 37.9 inches of rear headroom in the highly styled Charger compares with the Avalon's 37.5 inches and the Genesis sedan's 37.7 inches.
"If a roof or an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) system failed, we would not have the money to repair them," Superintendent Michael Cowan said recently. "We would have to remove the kids from that school and put them on double sessions in another facility."

In Morris County, Kinnelon Police say a quarter mile stretch of Kinnelon Road will be closed for three months for repairs, after the road collapsed, swallowing an Chevrolet Yukon on Sunday morning.

"The seventh inning was a little rocky, but we settled down," said Bailey, who allowed eight hits and two walks, while fanning eight to improve to 3-3. "There was a little concern, but you just have to push through it. You know you can pitch the ball. You know you have a good defense. You just have to believe in them and they have to believe in themselves."
Crowell, who is not on the conference committee, said House leaders are using the veterans funding issue as an excuse to delay the formal budget process and continue negotiations in private.
From the hottest styles (yes, they’ll even fix us up with a pouf à la Snooki if you desire) to the latest techniques (caviar facials and chromotherapyenabled floatation beds), we can, for a precious hour or two, forget about traffic, the economy, rising taxes -- at least until the bill comes.
Porter's performance as an isolated, often acid-tongued wife longing for a baby or even a touch from her distant husband, and Steinkamp's spot-on portrayal of an endearingly fastidious man with a quick sense of humor struggling to accept himself as a sexual being, rise above the others from this consistently excellent cast.
Homeowners could face liability if for example, a driver's car is stolen while parked on their driveway, or if a driver hits a pedestrian while entering or exiting the rental space.

We'd need money, of course. Nice Ride is sponsored by insurance companies, hospitals, restaurants, retailers, $350K from the city and a grant from the federal cornucopia.

I saw Foster the People at an Ex'pression Session and can attest that it's a great forum for live music. I highly recommend that music fans bookmark that Sessions' Web page and regularly check to see which acts are scheduled to visit the school.

So it was with some collective relief when Oregon's green credibility was reaffirmed in 2009 by its selection as one of six states to participate in the EV Project. The $230 million, stimulus-funded study is geared to put thousands of electric cars on the road across 18 cities, along with a network of more than 8,000 public charging stations, then watch how they get used.
The program began in 1983 under then-Gov. Tom Kean to help poor municipalities attract business. Governors and lawmakers have dipped into zone money, but — unlike Christie’s proposal — they repaid it.
"Fifteen years ago the oil sands was a marginal resource," said Adam Brandt, a professor at Stanford University's department of energy resources engineering.

The Clippers seem to have finally settled into a rotation. Mo Williams' job is to score (16.8 ppg), Eric Bledsoe's job is to defend, Nick Young's job is to make shots and Kenyon Martin's job is to defend everyone.

Not much has changed in the four years since. Obama has a big advantage among female voters, but he is way behind with white men. Romney doesn't excite them, of course -- he looks a bit too much like the guy in the expensive suit who comes in to announce layoffs. But, if Ted Nugent says Mitt is OK, they'll vote for the millionaire over the ukulele player any day of the week.
The initiative has no organized opposition. The largest turnout among the two major parties on primary day is expected to be among Republicans, who have more hotly contested primaries, including the race for state auditor and a crowded field in the 7th Congressional District race.
Army investigators came to Cleveland to interview Haeberle in August 1969.

"As Deighton lay by the fire, his head propped uncomfortably on his saddle," Kunzru writes in a scene taking place in 1920, "many things seemed to collapse into one: the runner disappearing and reappearing instantaneously at his destination, the wandering Spanish friar, Coyote clinging to his reed and weaving his way into the Land of the Dead. Was this where Garcés had journeyed in his lost days? Was this where the running Indian had led them?"

"For me, it's always been about trying to reinvent the song onstage and trying to keep it alive," he says. "It's never been about just playing the song exactly how it is on the record. The stage is this laboratory, just in the same way that the studio is a laboratory, and you're working with your friends on stage or in the studio trying your best to get to the heart of these songs. The outside world is an afterthought."
Studies suggest that religious beliefs are rooted in this intuitive processing, Gervais said. So, he wondered, would thinking analytically undermine religious belief as it overrides intuitive thought?

Blair Schulte and Kreitman finished of the Pirates with a kill each.
2. A quick story about the closer who almost thought he was a Cardinal. The trade deadline can be a tricky time, even for players, who are captives to the rumors and innuendo and speculation just like the fans, reporters and, yes, front office folks. That's how Heath Bell felt all of last season as he awaited what many thought was the inevitable change of address. At one point, Bell explained, he came to the ballpark as a San Diego Padre and expected to leave as a St. Louis Cardinal.
"All they know is what they hear, bad things, she’s had her ups and downs. Who hasn't?" she said in the taped interview — which will air Monday night during the 10 O'Clock News on Channel 9 in New York. "Let them think and know what they want to say … I just hope they never come and say it to me."

The actress finds just the right balance: Nothing melodramatic here (and this is all so ripe for melodrama!), just stony fatalism, broken dreams, the terrible solitude, and lots of cigarettes.

Written by Bill C. Davis when he was just two years out of college (around Mark's age), "Mass Appeal" was a big New York hit in 1980, picking up a number of awards. Its stagy formality dates it, and the issues it raises - What is the church for? What does celibacy imply? - are linked to its time and circumstance. Maybe you do have to be Catholic, and old enough to remember this period, to appreciate "Mass Appeal" fully. If not, will you care? Are you even entitled to an opinion?

Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Finding herself with a bit of time on her hands, Justice Ginsburg swung by Cairo last month to help out the lads from the Muslim Brotherhood building the new Egypt: "I would not look to the United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012," she advised them. Instead, she recommended the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the European Convention on Human Rights. That's why the fate of the republic will come down to a 5-4 vote.

Mexico's original take-out food, tamales (singular: tamal) developed in pre-Hispanic Mexico and became more sophisticated with the Spanish introduction of pork and other ingredients. Today, tamales show up as both walk-away snacks and elaborate fiesta delicacies, and like all Mexican cuisine, they vary widely by region and family tradition. The most popular rellenos (fillings) are pork and cheese, but might be anything from fish to iguana, augmented by pumpkin, pineapple rice or peanuts, and tucked into a blanket of yellow, black or purple corn dough called masa. They may be baked, steamed or grilled in a jacket of dried corn husks or fresh corn or banana leaves. Sometimes tamales are even wrapped in palm, avocado or leaves of chaya (a spinach-like vegetable).

Tunisians even under their previous dictatorship were relatively conciliatory toward Israel. As for Egypt, on its Arabic-language Web site, as opposed to the English version, the Muslim Brotherhood reasserts its fundamentalist and anti-American positions; moderates have been expelled or left the movement's leadership. Combined with the even more reactionary Salafists, Islamists overwhelmingly dominate Egypt's new parliament, to the fears of the country's large Coptic Christian minority. More likely Hamas would pull Fatah, still seen by many Palestinian Arabs as corrupt and ineffective — and kept in power in the West Bank largely through Israeli support — in its direction in a unity government.

Federal funds and private investors are other potential sources.
"The Long Good Friday" (1980) is a riveting contemporary gangster movie with a fatal flaw: its score. The of-the-moment synthesizer music was probably in vogue for about 24 months; today, "The Final Countdown" laughs at the "Long Good Friday" score. Hoskins plays a violent gangster who aspires to go legit. But on the eve of his finalizing a lucrative development deal, bad things begin to happen — a car bombing meant to kill his mom, the stabbing death of an associate, the bombing of his restaurant. You can't take your eyes off Hoskins as he becomes increasingly unhinged while seeking his unknown attacker. With Helen Mirren as Hoskins' in-the-know mistress and Pierce Brosnan as a hitman.

- Firing its 16-inch guns in the Arabian Sea, the U.S.S. Iowa shuddered. As the sky turned orange, a blast of heat from the massive guns washed over the battleship. This was the Iowa of the late 1980s, at the end of its active duty as it escorted reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz during the Iran-Iraq war.

"I need some kisses if we are gonna get married, baby," said Elvis. The brides obliged.
Musically, each of the 14 songs in the cycle is inspired by a different piece of classical music, all of which were originally without words. Adding lyrics was difficult: "I don't believe that you can just put music to anything and it works," Amos said. "Yes, you can put music to a phone book, but it doesn't mean that they're working together and making a magical expression."
The Illinois Department of Transportation will soon replace the aging spans in Madison County. Built in 1963, the truss bridges are in need of repair and are too narrow to accommodate more lanes in the future.

Hurricane Irene will cost federal taxpayers $1.5 billion in disaster relief aid nationwide, according to a preliminary estimate released by the White House Sunday.

The $25 billion program will "help around the edges" of the U.S. housing market but won't have a major impact, said Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight. He noted that U.S. homeowners owe an estimated $700 billion more than their homes are worth. The deal puts only about $13 billion toward refinancing or reducing debt for such "underwater" homeowners.

He said when he installed four $1,000 high-definition cameras that the owners of the home could monitor themselves through their smartphone, the insurance company completely eliminated the surcharge.
Cerf said an independent analysis will be conducted "as quickly as is humanly possible." He also released an "interim report" on charter schools that he said "dispels the notion" that charter schools don’t serve special needs kids. And he presented data showing that there are poor children in charter schools.
Falvey, for his part, said he does not agree the bridge was a "mistake," and sees a somewhat larger role for government.
No wonder Bob Irsay moved the Colts out of this hick town. These losers around here don't deserve professional sports. I hope the other team owners around here wise up and move their teams someplace where the locals aren't such uneducated dimwits. As for me, I look forward to rooting for the Pittsburgh Ravens.

EXCUUUUUSE me but this week’s WNBC-TV report stating Jane Hanson/Sara Gore’s 3 p.m. local talk show “New York Live” was going poop? I reported that lastyear . . . And excuse me but the channel’s evening news just had an American bison scoop saying once decimated they’re now returning, etc., etc.? I reported that weeks ago.

"I know that I will. But I didn't do it today. Regrets about that. But I will be very good for this team."
Just before Maryland took the floor against Wake Forest in the ACC tournament last month, Mark Turgeon landed a commitment from Charles Mitchell. And just after the Terps’ win over the Demon Deacons, the first-year coach appeared to give a not-so-subtle – but totally legal per NCAA rules – shout-out to the four-star power forward.
And to this day, The Titanic is big business in movies, books, songs, poetry, and museum exhibits hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean. Dozens of tourists have paid tens of thousands of dollars to dive in Russian submersibles to visit the ship's watery grave and see in the ocean floor "where the Titanic dug in and the ship created this knife-like sharp edge," Delgado said.

"We circled the whole issue of Southernness differently," said Ford, whose novel, "Independence Day," won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. "I think he embraced it in a way that he took sustenance from. He chose to live in William Faulkner's town, chose to stay in the South, to his great strength and credit. But he was not a regional talent. He was much larger than that."

Knowledgeable fans know how valuable are the stability and promise of this team's young pitching and defense. Still, in a city of mostly casual baseball fans, it is the long ball that is the fan magnet.
As economists like Michael Pettis of Peking University have patiently explained for years, China's rapid-fire growth has depended on the financial repression of these people. Deliberate policies allowed banks to capture their colossal pool of savings, pay them paltry government-mandated deposit rates, and turn these funds into cheap bank loans for exporters, state-owned firms and municipal governments. Much of that was used to fuel a manic construction drive that has gobbled up boatloads of Australian iron ore, Chilean copper and Indonesian coal.
"This is not surprising, as these studies are typically industry-funded, and industry-funded studies are usually not the best sources of information for economic effects," regardless of the industry, according to the 38-page analysis written by a team led by economist Mark Partridge, the Swank Chair of Rural-Urban Policy at OSU.
If anyone doubts his mental toughness, all you have to do is look back on the way this season started and marvel at the way he has battled back game by game. The turning point might actually be his previous start, when he did not give up an earned run over six innings against the Blue Jays, but he didn't get the win. If you're not keeping track of every inning, he has given up just one earned run over his last 12 1/3 -- against two supposedly superior AL East rivals.

The 29-page report, a first by the Obama administration, is designed to show the nation's commitment to human rights and, according to the report, areas "where problems persist in our society."
Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13" - itself inspired by the great 1959 Howard Hawks-John Wayne-Dean Martin jailhouse western "Rio Bravo" - made do without stars (even future stars) and with minimal production values. That's not a problem with Richet's remake, which has a great cast and lots of technical firepower, along with an engrossing story and lots of genre savvy. Richet and DeMonaco are buffs who respect their sources, both the '76 "Assault" and "Rio Bravo," and they've figured out clever ways to update them.
“We obviously know that Tim has a magnetic following,” Tannenbaum said. “We understand the popularity of any backup quarterback and this one is more unique than others.”

Gray said such systems work better in employer/employee situations.
Our AAA bond rating is based on the credit rating agencies' belief that the risk of Maryland defaulting on our state debt is not much greater than the risk that the US government will not pay back its bondholders.
"Without the city center, the suburbs are nothing," he said. "So if everybody who has influence, like myself, just dug their heels in and did one project, did one favor for the city of Cleveland, we could turn this thing around. Midtown is just where I chose to dig my heels in."

GOP leaders targeted Planned Parenthood by excluding clinics from the Medicaid Women's Health Program if they're affiliated with abortion providers, even though the clinics don't offer abortions. The decision means the loss of federal funding. The state also cut $73.6 million from another family planning program.
You have to be smart out there and know exactly what you're doing. You can't let things get to you. If there's a bad call or if you make a poor decision, you can't let it bother you. You just have to move on and always be picking up your teammates.

"They died up there, they died! They died!" Belfer told her in a voice full of fear. "There was an explosion!"
Turns out the Athenaeum was a trip highlight for me, too.
Watching his highlight tapes, it’s almost impossible to tell what position Ingram plays. He’s running for touchdowns on fake punts, dropping back into coverage to intercept passes and he’s busting through the line to rough up quarterbacks. He could be the best overall athlete on this list and would make a perfect pick in the 10-to-15 range. At the next level, we see him as a 3-4 linebacker given his incredible speed (at the combine he registered a 4.66) and phenomenal hands. Despite his size, he’s certainly strong enough to get around the edge.
"It looked like an animal had attacked that cat," said police spokeswoman Kelli Sheffer.
He added: “States, districts, schools and testing companies should have sensible safeguards in place to ensure tests accurately reflect student learning.”
Tolls and mass transit are just two of the touchy issues the executive committee will grapple with as it builds a project list for voters to consider in a 10-county referendum in 2012. Over 10 years, the 1-cent sales tax is likely to bring in perhaps $8 billion, according to state figures.
These are among the images and sounds behind the nation’s first coordinated $150-million media campaign to promote the U.S. to travelers worldwide. Details of the campaign are set to be released today at International Pow Wow 2012, a travel trade show at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

Rick Santorum, who is partial to the prohibition of many things, argues that the demon autocue should be next. "I've always believed that when you run for president of the United States," Santorum recently said in Mississippi, "it should be illegal to read off a teleprompter, because all you're doing is reading someone else's words to people."

Kemp also thought he could capitalize on the Braves' mistake, which was a mistake. Down the right-field line, he took a step into fair territory and was tagged by Freeman before walking back to first base. He was called safe at first, but the Braves argued and the umpires changed the call.
It wasn't a bad start. It wasn't too many penalties. It wasn't unfair calls. It wasn't a lack of spirit.
But they’re helped out, surprisingly and terrifically, by all the unself-conscious people around them – mostly actual townspeople whom Linklater interviewed about the real Bernie and Marjorie, just as if he were doing a documentary.

James began writing the books as fan fiction to Stephenie Meyer's "Twilight" series and quickly developed a cult-like following of her own. The romance between main characters Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey is surprising because of its unconventional nature: Grey asks Steele to sign a contract, and she agrees to be his "submissive" and to partake in a range of erotic activities. The stories were first published online, and as word of mouth spread, droves of people—many of them not traditional readers of romantic or erotic fiction—began downloading them on iPads and Kindles.
The Blazers have compiled a new list of candidates, with a strong emphasis on people with extensive general manager experience, and will, essentially, restart the search.

"There is one admitted case of email hacking, blagging (misrepresentation) on a very large scale ... and so on," he said.
Clinical trials on Qnexa also showed an increased risk of birth defects -- typically cleft lip -- in women who became pregnant on the drug. The study also found that users have an increase in heart rate. These side effects led to a thumbs-down vote when Qnexa came before the FDA advisory committee in 2010. The FDA subsequently denied approval in October 2010, citing potential safety problems.

Cheney served as former President George W. Bush's vice president for eight years, from 2001 until 2009. Cheney was a lightning rod for criticism during Bush's presidency, accused by opponents of often advocating a belligerent U.S. stance in world affairs during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Just because a project made the list, that doesn’t mean it would be fully funded. For example, the project to add optional toll lanes along I-75 and I-575 in Cobb and Cherokee counties is now on the list for $50 million -- a small fraction of the $1 billion it would take to build. The rest could come from toll money and state gas taxes.
I see that injustice and, again, I don't know what the answer is to that. Is the answer to boycott Last Thursday or Alberta? I know some people who have done that in smaller and larger ways. Is the answer to figure out what would be a more community-centered thing? Is the answer housing issues? I do know that it's not one or the other, either.
What's happening? One theory is hyperactive neurotransmitters, like dopamine, that help shuttle information into both short-term and long-term memory centers, change lanes. The visual information you are seeing for the first time ends up getting sent directly into long-term memory, before it is processed into short-term memory. The result: Your brain "recalls" the image of the Mayan temple from the long-term memory storage area and that tells you it's info from the past, not the present. Deja vu!

Mesa Prep's baseball team, which went undefeated in the regular season, has only 11 members, so having one sit out in a championship is a big deal, Arnold said. Besides, Sultzbach earned the right to play in the title game, she said.

Rahal denied chopping in front of Andretti.
So, for the pilot project, she and staffers placed 10 recliners in a darkened room that had been used for employee meditation. They angled the chairs in such a way that patients couldn't see each other. They did not believe additional separation was necessary as acupuncture patients don't have to undress -- they just roll up their sleeves or pants legs, or maybe expose a part of their belly.
