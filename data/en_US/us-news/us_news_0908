“Mostly it’s instinct and some God-given ability to move laterally and not let guys get their hands on me as quick as they want to,” Cruz said when asked about his releases. “It’s something I work on and then, on top of that, working on it in practice and working on it with (wide receivers coach Sean Ryan), listening to his pointers and what he tells us to do. All of that kind of mixed in makes for successful techniques.”

I love that salads are not humdrum sides here. For $6, a bowl of mixed spring greens came tossed with Mandarin oranges, toasted coconut, rich avocado, diced red bell peppers and a mango dressing.

Written by Charise Castro Smith, a 27-year-old playwright and actress from Miami, the play weaves together three stories of people in pursuit of the unlikeliest of dreams, combining elements of magic realism and science fiction and upping the ante repeatedly with moments of apocalyptic transformation. As surreal as its action gets, it's very much about human emotion and desire, exploring, in Smith's words, "how people get broken and put back together and broken and put back together in this cyclical way."

Instead, try dabbing lavender, lemon, eucalyptus or orange oil in the corners of rooms (try dropping the oil into rugs, the corners of mattresses, on curtains and into the edges of the upholstery). You also can fill an old spray bottle with 2 cups water to 10 drops of essential oil, and spray it around the house.

White House spokesman Jay Carney defended the travel, saying it helped win over Republicans.
"I am the greatest food critic in the world," thinks 68-year-old Pierre Arthens, just 48 hours from death. "It is I who has taken this minor art and raised it to a rank of utmost prestige. Everyone knows my name, from Paris to Rio, Moscow to Brazzaville, Saigon to Melbourne and Acapulco." Yup, he's insufferable, and yet there are those who love him. We see Pierre from all angles; his wife and three children; his beloved nephew; his concierge, his dog. These myriad impressions are what he leaves behind. "His prose . . . his prose was nectar, ambrosia, a hymn to language: it was gut-wrenching, and it hardly mattered whether he was talking about food or something else." Pierre remembers the tastes of his childhood; of Tangier and Rabat. He remembers his grandmother's cooking, his Aunt Marthe's garden, a true American breakfast he had in a San Francisco diner. He longs for a particular flavor. He can't think what it is -- until his very last moments. A pastry -- chouquettes -- complex and unique and rare in the way that only simple foods can be. Pierre is the Grinch. His heart is three sizes too small: "I am an encyclopedic esthete," he confesses, "who is always one dish ahead of the game -- but always one heart behind."

If the University Singers are his pride and joy, Doyle is probably best known for expanding the city's choral horizons through his civic choir, Choral Arts Ensemble. Over the years, he has led the three-dozen singers in rarely performed works like the "Missa Solemnis," often for no other reason than he simply wants to hear the music. But he also has a canny ear for smaller, unusual pieces. A few years ago, when Bower was on the group's board of directors, the choir's library of sheet music filled so many filing cabinets, they stretched clear across his garage.

The death capped a multiyear manhunt for the architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that left nearly 3,000 people dead and dramatically altered U.S. foreign policy and the nation's sense of security.

To their credit, the people pushing the Lake Oswego streetcar are honest about the fact that the project boils down to an expensive assist to redevelopment in John's Landing, downtown Lake Oswego and the town's Foothills District. It's merely the latest step in a generation-long push to use light rail to guide growth around Portland and its first-tier suburbs. Gresham and Beaverton got rail, the thinking goes, and Milwaukie will soon. Why should Lake Oswego miss its turn?

As much as I agree with Durbin, his view sounds an awful lot like, "Vote for us because the other guy wants to destroy the country." Which is a Republican mantra. And I hate to find myself echoing it. But sometimes the extreme position is also the true one. Sometimes you need to shout "fire!" because the place is burning. The Republican approach is wrong. There is no past to go back to. The only direction to move is forward, and to do that, both sides have to work together. Without compromise, democracy doesn't work. This election isn't about abortion or gay marriage or the price of fuel. It's about buses and the other things we need government to do.

Another example: I just watched a YouTube video of a Singaporean singing hauntingly of jet engines falling through her ceiling. In the time it took to listen to the three-minute clip, 10 people added their comments, bringing the total to 6,484 comments on one video by an anonymous amateur using a laptop's microphone and a Web cam. We should dub this massive shift something grand like Community Creativity, or the Knowledge Renaissance, or something. UGC demeans it.

That theme is "Danny Boy" — yes "Danny Boy" — first disguised as a kind off-kilter, off-key Renaissance dances. When the tune finally arrives full-blown, harmonized microtonality, the feeling I got was of the room doubling in size, so vast were the sonorities. A much too famous tune by a much too nonfamous composer was made magnificent.
In 2004, as reported by the Post-Dispatch's Paul Hampel and Ken Leiser, Metro and Mr. Musick, the developer of the Meridian office-retail project at Hanley Road and Interstate 64, had agreed to go partners on the Meridian garage, near Metro's Brentwood MetroLink station.

Sleep deprivation is more than a nuisance, Luckhaupt warned. A 2006 report from the National Academies Press reported that 20% of vehicle crashes can be traced to drowsy drivers. From a medical point of view, getting fewer than six hours of sleep per night can increase one’s risk for cardiovascular disease and obesity.

Yes, folks, in an era when Democrats and Republicans seem one step from brawling on the House and Senate floors, Mourdock sees the problem as too much bipartisanship. That's like saying the Colts' problem last season was too many wins. It's a scary thought from someone who, thanks in part to the backing of a handful of super PACs and special interest groups, is in a tight battle against Sen. Richard Lugar for the Republican Senate nomination.
We headed out the with a to-go order of warm sweet rolls ($2.85 for three, $5 for seven, $8.25 for a dozen). Five minutes after we were back in the office the only thing that remained of the signature treats were the guilty, contented smiles of my co-workers.
So much of our sagging profile abroad is simply a growing realization that the Middle East is, well, the Middle East: You can change the faces, but the regimes end up mostly the same -- as innate reflections of the volatile mix of tribalism, vast infusions of oil money, radical Islam, and generations of dependency.

"In this business, people just care about results. They don't really care about where you're from. Now I feel that being a producer living in Ohio is a real competitive advantage. To remain competitive and stay relevant, I had to figure out a way to make high-value films at low cost. What I call the home-state advantage works. Not only is there a good tax-incentive program here, but I also know all the people who control the locations. I'm friends with the local government, the cast, the crew. I can call in favors.

The revelations came as the TSA’s regional director visited Newark Liberty Monday to discuss how to improve security at the airport. TSA Area Director Jim Blair, whose region includes New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, led a discussion that also included airport managers from around the region.

The Scouts put a recipe that called for five items or less in donated grocery bags and distributed them to those interested in helping. Those who participated took a bag, purchased the items needed for the enclosed recipe and returned the bag to the Scouts, who donated them to the pantry.
A typical, hypothetical scenario might look like this: A liberal group with a nonpartisan name like Colorado First puts out a list of polluters and demands official action. A Republican running for Colorado office is on the list. Paid liberal bloggers chatter. An online liberal publication with a newspaper-like name writes an article about the candidate and his company polluting Colorado's streams. A liberal advocacy group puts out a news release, citing the group and the publication, which sound reputable to an ordinary voter. They mass e-mail the release and attach a catchy phrase to it like "Dirty Doug." At some point, the mainstream media checks out the allegations. Depending on the facts, a news outlet does a story.

A friend suggested the next to the last line should be "and we all eat each other," but that would upset the balance of the universe and Joaquin Phoenix. Did you know he's a vegan and a member of PETA, and he narrated an anti-animal-abuse documentary called "Earthlings" in 2005? At the time, Joaquin said, "Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most." That was of course before he made "I'm Still Here" which was about him becoming a rap star, but it turned out to be a dumb hoax and people talked about that instead of his worthy animal cause and have since moved on and are now talking about other stuff like the holograph Tupac Shakur, which may go on tour with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.
