I also appreciated the quality of the halibut ($29) topped with a crunchy kohlrabi salad bathed in a prosciutto vinaigrette, although I question pairing it with a thick, dark sauce, so sweet it would overpower mutton.

Ray had been in trouble since the sixth grade, when he stole school lunch money in Ewing, Mo., where his impoverished family lived for a time. He dropped out of the ninth grade, was booted from the Army and arrested for a burglary in East Alton because he had lost his shoes at the scene. Not the savviest criminal, he once tumbled out of a getaway car during a tight turn. He did time in Kansas and Illinois before returning to St. Louis in August 1959. He robbed the store two months later and drew the 20.

A number of officers were treated intravenously for dehydration, and one broke his ankle, said sheriff's Sgt. Cindi West said.
I always considered this tax to be grossly regressive and another example of preferential treatment for the wealthy. The most obvious solution, one that would make the tax more fair and raise much needed revenue, is to increase or abolish the cap on contributions. Raising the eligibility age may also be necessary, but that would impose a real burden on firemen, policemen, construction workers and others who are required to have physical prowess in their professions.

Betty Confronts Mortality: It's a stroke of genius to begin the episode with Betty struggling to get zipped into her dress, failing, and deciding to stay home rather than accompany Henry to the Junior League of New York affair. Where is that Grace Kelly-like icon of early '60s glamour? Betty's hair is teased into an unflattering style, her face is full, and she's clearly -- in the words of Joan's undermining mother last week -- not at her fighting weight.
Neither the attorney general's report nor Polk County officials have said how much or what evidence is missing.

"Everything went, but for some reason that stayed," Bystrom said.
“I think you’ve still got some young players that are going to have to step up for us. Jamal has some versatility in playing the two and the one, which, with his experience, is obviously going to be a nice addition for us. But at the end of the day, with 66 games in a 123 days, every player is going to have to contribute. And having as much depth as you can, especially in a season like this, is critical. And that’s why I feel adding Jamal was an important move for us from that regard.

Some children may have trouble parting with their toys. It can be human nature sometimes to hold on to what is "mine" even if the child doesn't play with the toy very often. However, parents can use the toy purging as an opportunity to talk to children about the importance of giving to others who may be less fortunate. Not every child is lucky enough to receive toys, and parents can teach their children to be grateful for what they have and compassionate to others.
The company’s name is a combination of the first two letters of their last names. “Zoku also means family or clan in Japanese,” Zorovich adds. That made the name an even better fit for the company, he says. “It's about products for the home and bringing families together.”

Barring a change of heart between now and this summer, Indiana officials said Thursday that they will not renew the contract to play Kentucky because of a disagreement over where to hold the games.

Patrick J. Flynn retired on Sept. 13, 2004 - about four months after the investigation of David Koschman's homicide case went dormant - and gets a yearly police pension of more than $64,000. On top of that, Flynn, 61, makes a salary of $53,628 a year as a security officer for the city of Chicago Department of Aviation - a job that he started three days after retiring from the police department. He is able to collect a city pension and a city paycheck at the same time because his old and new jobs are covered by different pension plans.
"This program has also provided homeowners the opportunity to be removed from the floodway, which just recently had waters in excess of 10 feet high on the property," said Frank Spizzirri, chairman of the Pequannock open space advisory committee. "Irene was the worst in town since 1902 and worse than 1984, to say the least. The owners are very excited about the buyout and are searching for a new place in town to settle."

Lacy, who says she believes but cannot prove that the percentage of unreported rapes is actually much higher, gave another reason for revisiting the project this year. The organizers of the cultural extravaganza Pacific Standard Time asked her to participate in their performance art festival, which officially starts Thursday, by suggesting she reprise a ritualistic performance about the Hillside Strangler. She found the topics in the rape project more urgent and relevant, and the alternative gallery LACE signed on to produce it.
"I’m glad to see there’s an attempt on the part of the player to do some things together,” Coughlin said. “A big part of what we do in the offseason is team building. We haven’t had the opportunity to do that. Any time you get to spend together is a good thing.”

The family room flat screen TV is framed in such a find. This antique whitewashed wood structure looks as if it once bordered a front door with a high-backed bench on each side. It's an inviting departure from the armoire or built-in entertainment center.
He said the discussion was overheard by a police officer working on reports in an adjoining room.
"If he has a defect, it is one of managing by stress," Volpato said. "Not everyone can sustain these rhythms for two to three years. It is very heavy."
The solution was not easy, but it was also not complicated. We had spent too much as a state. We had lived beyond our means. And by trying to tax their way out of it, previous governors and legislators had left New Jersey in 50th place – dead last among the states – in the total tax burden it placed on our citizens.
Michener said that since 2009 Aetna has had a policy of covering such procedures as breast-cancer screenings for those who have not had a mastectomy after becoming a man and prostate-cancer screenings for men who became women and retained their prostate.
Instead of the confetti, balloons and good will that typically mark the end of the General Assembly's 90-day session, the legislature adjourned Monday with a toxic mixture of anger and disbelief that the Democratic-controlled body gridlocked and was forced to enact a fallback budget that cuts deeply into Democratic spending priorities.

We still don't know exactly what happened after George Zimmerman got out of his vehicle, but since he had a gun (which he was not supposed to be carrying as a crime watch member) he would feel safer about confronting Martin. Without the gun, he would more likely have been cautious and kept a distance from him.
“It had everything I was looking for in a school and not just from a football standpoint,” he said. “Obviously I love the football program, and I think I fit in really well there. They have a fast, aggressive defense, and they like my size and how I can get up the field.”
Officials with the council of imams did not comment on the meeting today.
Investors were also cautious ahead of an inflation report in China. Traders speculated that the report, due Thursday, could show that prices are rising quickly as the economy there continues to grow at a fast pace.

For instance, my sister's husband was invited to (and attended) my otherwise all-female baby shower, while my boyfriend, now the father of my child, was not invited to our annual holiday vacation. Mom's argument is that being treated like family is one of the benefits/incentives of legal marriage. (I would like to get married, but realize it's not right for my boyfriend and me at this time.)

Luv all the Blue you want, but how many coaches and teams have promised to kick that you-know-what in next year? Most of them failed.
The suit could, of course, help boost turnout among Hispanic voters in key areas across the West. And stridently anti-immigrant rhetoric could turn off independent voters. Yet many foresee a midterm electorate featuring an energized Republican base � for whom the immigration issue has emerged as a priority � prompting moderate white Western voters who are concerned about jobs to decamp to the GOP at least in the short term, political observers said.
On those same three occasions, researchers measured the students' skin color in terms of lightness, redness and yellowness using a spectrophotometer — a machine designed to do that sort of thing.

Among the sources of instability cited by Human Rights Watch is the fact that the Congolese army has recently added 10,000 new soldiers who were previously fighters for local rebel groups.

It's not easy to sell himself to an employer without an address or phone number. He only recently recovered an official identification card.
For a team that can't endure another injury, the Blazers don't mind Aldridge walking around with bruised wrists. For much of Aldridge's first four seasons, the Blazers coaching staff has implored him to play closer to the basket to take advantage of his 6-foot-11 frame. After a summer of focusing on his inside moves, Aldridge is finally comfortable -- and effective -- down low.
Since young adults generally are a healthier age group, insurers haven't made an issue of the new requirement. Many even began offering the expanded family coverage before the mandate, said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.
For now, there seems to be a sense that ASU won't tolerate a win-at-all-costs football program. After a point-shaving scandal in basketball and the controversy generated by Pat Murphy's baseball program, the school must be very careful of jumping the rails anytime soon. There also seems to be enough safeguards in place, enough high-minded people and serious academic missions to keep the athletic program from mocking and embarrassing the whole.
Obama campaign officials said Sunday that Mr. Clooney's number may be inflated, but they concurred that the event, priced at $40,000 a person, is likely to be lucrative. And it may signal that Mr. Obama successfully mollified dismayed Hollywood executives when he personally called them in the wake of the January antipiracy decision.
"I think it’s nonsense," Askin said. "It’s just a political statement ... It shouldn’t get anywhere."
Adult means 19 to 35. They're both in their mid 30s and competed against much younger couples, beating 24 of them for the top honors. The event was a national qualifier. The duo, who hail from the Ukraine, will dance in a national competition in Baltimore in April.
Meanwhile, reporter Pat Galbincea was burning up the phone lines, trying to find somebody who might have known Bales in high school. "I must have left two-dozen messages," he said. "It was Friday night; nobody was home. Some of the people who got messages from me must have thought I was nuts."
Indeed, a no-holds-barred bid to organize more reality-show writers was a major plank of Patric Verrone's successful campaign to become president of the Writers Guild of America, West, two years ago. Verrone, perceived as a hard-liner, has since become a thorn in the studios' side during the recent negotiations. One key factor in the rancorous breakdown of talks Dec. 7 was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers' demand that the guild drop its proposal to extend union membership to writers of reality, as well as animated, material.

Gilliam says the OLCC is "trying to do it half-way" by choosing which stores would be allowed to offer liquor. Anything short of a broad expansion, he says, "probably lights the fuse for an initiative campaign."

Hugh Grant's Pirate Captain (that's his name) is all Hugh Grant stutter and "glittering eyes and glorious beard." As a pirate, he's something of a bust, even though his crew adores him. He figures he's due for the "Pirate of the Year" award. But he's always come up short in the booty and pillaging department. There's always a Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek), Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry) or Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) to beat him to the podium.

"But the style that we prefer is the work-before-skill style. It seems like every year a team wins the Stanley Cup and teams always try to mimic their style.

We're just learning to win the big games now against the good teams."

The only coral reef in the Gulf of California, at an estimated 20,000 years one of the oldest on North America's Pacific coast, lies off of Cabo Pulmo's shore. Parts of the shallow coral mountain lie just 10 miles offshore, sheltering 226 fish species. In addition to sea turtles, dolphins, tiger and bull sharks, and migrating humpback and blue whales, Cabo Pulmo is one of the few spots in the Americas where rare whale sharks — the largest fish alive — congregate near land.
Hermosa Beach is just 1.3 square miles. But it has plenty of action, beginning with the surfers in the water, the anglers on the pier and the world-class volleyball players thumping and sprawling by the nets on the sand. To explore all this from an upscale perch, begin by booking the Beach House at Hermosa Beach (1300 the Strand), where summer rates start at $299.

Then go body surf or bike or stroll a little more, and break for lunch and browsing at Gum Tree (238 Pier Ave.). This is another converted bungalow, its interior split between a gift and home shop and a cafe. House-made granola? Check. Four-dollar organic peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the kids? Check.

Then, addressing the blanket strip-search rule the court’s decision says is allowable under the U.S. Constitution, he said, "It's a shame, because the Supreme Court kind of rubber-stamped that rule; and it's not a rule that should stand — it’s not fair, and it doesn’t seem justified."

If walling yourself off from the rest of the room is too extreme, designer Alfredo Häberli's Take a Line for a Walk strikes a good balance between intro- and extroversion. As with Arne Jacobsen's iconic Egg Chair (the midcentury classic that this chair evokes with more angular lines), the generously proportioned seat encourages you to curl up, while the enveloping headrest gives you a sense of separation without coming off as anti-social. It does an exceptional job of blocking out the periphery so you can pay attention to what's in front of you. There's a matching ottoman to complete the look, as well as a version of the chair with a low integrated footrest made of tubular metal that lets you take a load off without wondering whether you should remove your shoes. $4,126, moroso.com

They go out of their way to serve their customers and to make sure they understand about the medications. This week I needed a medication they would have had to order in for the next day. I urgently needed the med and could not wait, so they called a local drug chain, a competitor, with my prescription and all my insurance info. All I had to do was pick it up.

Every Southwestern road trip requires some seriously vertical scenery, so our first stop was Fish River Canyon, two days' drive south of Windhoek. It's practically unheard of outside Namibia, but the scale at Fish River is second only to the Grand Canyon. Here, though, there are no acres of parking, tourist-packed buses or IMAX theaters — just a small, deserted viewing platform. You're free to wander as far as you like along the unfenced canyon rim, alone with your thoughts on what might as well be the edge of the world.

Can you give me your best, honest reasons on why Mark Buehrle was allowed to leave? He was a fan favorite for good reasons -- a team leader, an innings eater, and pretty darn dependable. Is this a Kenny Williams mistake, or a plan? I think KW does a decent job of keeping things exciting, but I'm really frustrated that he's made all these big moves (Rios, Dunn, Peavy), but did not plan to keep a great pitcher who meant a lot to the team and fans. He seemed set on losing him from the start. I've never been on the fire KW bandwagon, but if this was just poor planning on KW's part, shouldn't there be consequences? This one was hard to swallow, hopefully Robin Ventura exceeds expectations. It may be a long summer. Go Sox. -- Sam, Portland, Ore.

I want to talk about the importance of why Christ came, to explain that he died and he rose and he gives his life for us.

But beyond the warmth and care conveyed by a hand-sewn quilt, Agnew realized that she could offer up a political commentary from the threads in her hands. A showstopper piece in shades of black and gray features a textile worker leaning close to her sewing machine. The "drawing with thread" is beautiful in its own right, but when the viewer realizes that every inch of the quilt face is made of tags cut from clothing made in overseas garment factories, the work takes on a different weight.

As do the high costs — financial and otherwise — of Illinois' lost decade. The harm in this case, U.S. District Judge James Zagel said at sentencing, "is the erosion of public trust in government."

Her attorney, Charles Singer, said the expenses were justified because they were part of a conventional depletion of assets to qualify Scott Nelson for state-funded health insurance. Eileen Nelson had failed to do that, resulting in a large nursing home bill and delaying her husband's move to a group home, so the nursing home and Scott Nelson himself asked Brown to step in, Singer said.

Salaries for training in just about every specialty are $45,000 annually.

Sensible handbag (also black for day). Boxy, short-handled and discreet, the queen's handbag is almost always the same shape—sometimes with a gold buckle or clasp, and sometimes in patent rather than what looks to be calfskin. Go for something English, like the bags of the newly crowned business woman of the year, Anya Hindmarch (try the "Carker," pictured, or "Lautner"), or Mulberry's "East West Bayswater."

At the heart of social life is the reality that for any wrongdoing to persist for any length of time requires the inaction of others.

Fair play. The opportunity to make it if you try. And the responsibility to reach back and help someone else make it, too.

But that sounds dry. His approach to flavor also can be bada-bing, bada-boom.

Hirsi Ali may be the first refugee from Western Europe since the Holocaust. As such, she is a unique and indispensable witness to both the strength and weakness of the West: to the splendor of open society and to the boundless energy of its antagonists. She knows the challenges we face in our struggle to contain the misogyny and religious fanaticism of the Muslim world, and she lives with the consequences of our failure each day. There is no one in a better position to remind us that tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.

Hopper's classic rock sets have earned a lively, if aging, following who don't mind that the singer with the punk haircut needs glasses to read his lyrics. Guys camouflage their gray with highlights, tuck their bellies into leather pants, and betray their fantasies with age-inappropriate dates. Just watch out for the tipsy middle-aged woman singing along to the Journey power ballads. Turn your back, and she'll hit on your date. She must have taken to heart the poem the housekeeper left on beds at turn-down time. It reads, in part, "The future is an ocean filled with opportunity and delight."

In March, that panel determined there wasn't enough evidence to support Ackerman's January finding that Knox's move was athletically motivated. The panel concluded a "significant motivation" for Knox to transfer was to be closer to his biological father.

Even the young Ernest Hemingway spent considerable time during his Kansas City Star apprenticeship in 1917-18 making his way through the long menu of a downtown Chinese spot. He knew there was variety beyond chow mein, and he was impressed by, though not much in love with, the many ways sea slugs were prepared and served. (Even now, he wrote a few years later, the word sea slug makes me shudder.)
And in a city plagued by dry, thick omelets, 2Schae's Mediterranean version ($8.75) was wonderfully thin, delicate and filled with feta, fresh spinach, sautéed mushrooms, red onion, finely diced tomatoes and briny kalamata olives - a true treat that just may be 2Schae's ticket to thrive.

If you want to know why, listen to this from a longtime college sports administrator I trust: "I think the Big 12 job is probably the toughest of the BCS commissionerships other than the Big East.

I thought of that movie when I heard about Neil Bosanko's plans for what appears to be his final days on Earth. Bosanko is the longtime executive director of the South Chicago Chamber of Commerce, but really he is much more than that.

Cover crops include oats, buckwheat and annual rye, as well as many legumes. These legumes, or pod-bearing plants, are of special benefit because they harvest nitrogen from the air and deposit it in nodules, varying from the size of a pinhead to that of a BB pellet, on their roots. The nitrogen becomes available to nourish other plants when the host plant dies. That is one reason that corn (a heavy feeder) often follows garden peas or beans (both legumes).
The 40-acre West End site sits near a key transportation hub along the St. Louis Park-Minneapolis border in what was once an underused commercial area on the east side of the city.

I ordered a mandarin orange vodka and soda and had a seat to try and figure out the place. Manilow's is ostensibly a gay/lesbian night club, albeit one with some unusual features.

If the dance floor wasn't in the middle of it all, you probably wouldn't peg the place as a club at all.
