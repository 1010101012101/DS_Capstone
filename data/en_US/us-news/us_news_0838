Ridley's rendition of Etta James's "At Last" impressed the "America's Got Talent" judges and she was selected to compete on the show in 2010. Perhaps "America's Got Talent" judge Howie Mandel said it best: "You deserve to be heard by much more than everyone on the train."
The young editor of the Century, Richard Watson Gilder, joked of being busy with "general catching" as he approached the Civil War's military's leaders to write about the leading battles of the war. He caught them: Union generals Ulysses S. Grant and George B. McClellan; Confederate generals James Longstreet, Jubal Early and John Bell Hood. Yes, they defended battle strategies and sometimes sought to settle old scores, but their essays allow the reader to enter into the thinking and feeling of the leaders as they describe vividly the most significant battles of the war.

Body weight: Men with a few pounds to lose may have another excuse why that stubborn fat won't leave. David Phillips of the University of Southampton in England analyzed the weight of 1,750 British seniors and found that 13.8% of men with birthdays from January to March qualified as obese but only 9.4% of those born from October to December did so. In women, seasonal trends were less apparent. Phillips argues that exposure to low temperatures in early life might promote development of fatty tissue and predispose winter-borns to obesity in adulthood. Lab studies support his theory: Rats subjected to cold before or soon after birth store more ingested energy as fat, even when the temperature is no longer low.

Soderbergh's innate cynicism and lack of empathy for his characters bubbles through, as it did most notably in "Contagion," and that, too, might be called cool, though the better label is "chilly." That means we're not as engaged to Mallory as we might be, that there's little warmth to the character's romantic partners or even to her scenes with her rich novelist ex-Marine dad (Bill Paxton).

Since Tuesday evening, though, I've having trouble getting another disturbing number off my mind: 125,567.
After an abysmal performance in 2010 the offensive line bounced back to have an adequate 2011 campaign. For this reason there is not as much concern about how the group will fare in the upcoming season as there was last year entering spring. However, the unit will still be still replacing three starters. In addition, with the release of the spring depth chart there was still plenty of offseason shuffling that went on. I still think this is an area for concern. In order for Rutgers to have a big season, they will need to control the line of scrimmage and be able to run the ball and protect the quarterbacks. Two players to keep an eye on are center Dallas Hendrickson and tackle R.J. Dill. If Hendrickson can come right in and show that he is not only recovered from his knee injury but stronger than he was last year, he can be a dependable force in the middle. Likewise if Dill, the Maryland transfer who started the most part of three seasons there, can do the same at right tackle, Rutgers will be essentially picking up two solid free agents to solidify their 2012 line and replace the departed seniors.

"It's hard to believe that's the third-oldest baseball stadium now. All I remember is walking into the ballpark and it was so antiseptic you could eat off the floors. It was obvious then that it was time for baseball to come to the West Coast, and with the Dodgers, Los Angeles gained in Carl Furillo, Pee Wee Reese, Carl Erskine, Jim Gilliam and Duke Snider a close-knit family. We had 11 farm clubs at the time, so getting up there and staying after all the instruction at winter ball in Latin America and Dodgertown was the final step of a great baseball education."

Mary and Joseph did not get to pore over a list of most popular baby names. They did not get to name their firstborn child after a relative or a friend, or worry about what how his name would look on a driver's license or a business card. They name him Jesus because that's what the angel told them his name would be. I wonder how many parents in the 21st century would be okay with having to forfeit the right and the privilege of naming their own child? We tend to see our children as our own, rather than thinking of them as gifts given to us by God. It might surprise or even worry many of us to think that God already has an identity in mind for them, a destiny and a purpose that are more important than our own hopes, plans, and dreams.

This time, outshot 3-0 just 4:32 into the game, Flyers coach Peter Laviolette called his 30-second timeout in hopes of regrouping his squad's new lines. Briere won the faceoff in the Flyers zone and the team got off a shot, but the Devils continued to push forward while clogging up the neutral zone to prevent the Flyers from using their speed. The Devils' counterattacks came far more often than the ones generated by their vaunted neutral-zone trap of the 1990s.

California pomegranate plantings have surged in the last decade from 5,000 to nearly 30,000 acres — more than plums — due to the fruit's intense flavor, reputed health benefits and beauty.

For making juice, it can't be beat, but for eating fresh, the seeds within the arils (the little juicy nuggets popularly called "seeds") are too hard and chewy for many people.

Meanwhile, the stock market downturn in 2008 punched a major hole in the pension fund that has yet to be filled.

For state agencies alone, the cost of funding retirement benefits is expected to jump by 6.8 percent of payroll, an additional $357 million in the next two-year budget cycle.

My only real complaint about Compex, beyond the steep price, has to do with portability and ease of use. Even with the high-end model I tested, I found the complexity of the procedure frustrating: the jumble of cables, the peeling and reapplying of stickers, the intricate diagrams.

The early portion of this season gave little hint that Maryville would qualify for the national tournament. By mid-December, the Saints had endured a six-game losing streak, including losses to a pair of Division I opponents, Wyoming and Colorado State. Since then, Maryville is 17-5. Ellis also noted that nine of the Saints' 15 losses in 2010-2011 were by less than 10 points.
At the same time, the Harrises wanted the 4,000-square-foot four-bedroom modernist home to be in harmony with the surrounding landscape. In fact, they bought the deep wooded lot for the abundance of mature trees, including a lovely tamarack tree at the front of the property. To save that tree, Alt asked the city for a variance for the home's setback. "The tree was a critical piece of the landscape," Alt said, so critical that he positioned the home's front entrance near the tamarack.

To pay for it, UPS has shelved its plan announced in September to buy back at least $8 billion of its stock through 2014. Instead, it said on Thursday it has authorized buybacks of up to $5 billion, including $1.5 billion this year and another $1.5 billion next year. The new buyback replaces a $10 billion repurchase authorized in 2008 that still had $1.9 billion remaining, UPS spokesman Norman Black said.

Agents J and K are back — sort of. When Tommy Lee Jones' K goes missing, Will Smith's J is transported to 1969 to partner with the younger K (Josh Brolin). Director Barry Sonnenfeld's sci-fi flick about a clandestine agency tasked with keeping aliens in check has always messed with the space-time continuum. Fear not, Jones is around here somewhere, but Brolin appears ready for some uncanny channeling of the laconic actor in this long-time-coming follow-up. (May 25, not yet rated)

And, yes, the GOP-controlled House failed to pass a budget resolution in 2011. But this year, the House has returned to the norm and passed the highly controversial spending plan largely crafted by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. The Ryan budget portends big changes and represents a genuine attempt to curb deficits before it takes a third of federal revenue just to pay the interest on the national debt. But its cuts in entitlement programs infuriate many groups, which call the plan heartless and unnecessary.
Mayor Frank Jackson announced last week that he's looking to hire a consulting firm to identify ways to save Cleveland money. As Wall Street continues to nosedive and the overall economic outlook worsens, Jackson says he wants another set of eyes to focus on financial efficiency. That's smart.
Financiers depend on ground almonds for texture and part of their flavor. Well-stocked grocery stores often carry ground nuts, but if you grind them at home, put them in a food processor and add a small portion of the powdered sugar from the recipe.

"Serving Up Style," in its second year, gave 10 Portland interior designers and architects an empty 12-by-12-foot dining room space to hatch their creations. The result ranged from Henry's Brown's "Celebrations!," which offered decadent treatment to a festive table shimmering in metallic silvers and pinks and surrounded by glitter snow, to Nicole Helene's "Into the Woods," a simple and spacious design that wall-hung the bark from local walnut and alder trees around a warmly lit wooden table where mason jars and basic cutlery sat.

This is good news for anybody who loves basketball, but anybody who loves basketball knows not to expect greatness in the opening days of the regular season. Early NBA is as scattershot as the debut of a new restaurant—no matter how hard the staff tries, you're going to get someone else's cold pumpkin soup. The rust should be especially thick for a league not expected to begin training camp until the second week of December. Post-lockout NBA may be short on the elegant ballet, heavy on the 14-foot brick.

Two of the most exciting moments of the weekend came in our Thursday afternoon ride. All of us were ready to do some loping - the western riding term for the fast three-beat gait that is more controlled than an all-out gallop - and we were able to do a fair amount of it during the afternoon. Early in the ride, however, Sabrina asked Miko for an unscheduled rest stop. He found a secluded spot, and Sabrina dismounted and disappeared into the bushes. As the rest of us waited on horseback, we heard her ask if there were other horses approaching. Puzzled, we looked around and then someone spotted a very large black and white cow ambling toward the bushes that hid Sabrina. We hollered at her to hurry up, and she headed back to her horse at a run. The cow stopped and watched her, probably more baffled than perturbed, but we embellished the story each time it was told for the rest of the weekend.

But attention must be paid, if only because 15 percent of all vice-presidential nominees since 1900 have wound up in the Oval Office.

The concerns about such practices are two-fold: state law bars traditional health insurers from setting premiums of small companies using anything other than geography and the age and gender of employees.

As with every Judd Apatow production, there's nothing here that wouldn't have been better at a shorter length and quicker pace. At two hours, the drawn-out gags, scenes that leisurely run far past their punch line or payoff, and the overdose of supporting players burden the film.
Should the merger be approved by the PSC? On that essential question, more needs to be heard. But if the deal is ultimately approved, it should be with the condition that the two companies invest substantially more than $50 million in renewable energy, a potential win all around: for BGE customers, Maryland's economy and for Exelon.

Role model: "Alton Brown, the host of the Food Network's 'Good Eats,' has been a role model to me. On his show, he has shown me how to push the boundaries of science through cooking. He explains the why and the how about the reactions in food. This has been a huge inspiration to me in my teen years."
"One district ... is more than 32,000 square miles," Murphy said. "Given the 26 percent cut legislators have already taken in salary and benefits, and the 15 percent additional cut the speaker made to the Assembly operating budget, today's action seems punitive, and not in line with the commission's duty to size legislative compensation to the job."
Rolling Stone publisher and Rock Hall founder Jann Wenner was finishing his espresso in a hidden corner of the library. "It's another wild year," he said. "We mixed and matched them. There will be drama and thrills."
"I like being thrown into the fire a little bit," Luck said when asked about the immersion into the playbook. "It's like Coach Clyde (Christensen) says, throw some mud at the wall and see what sticks. But I think no matter what, you're going to struggle out there at first."

Prosecutor’s detectives have always teamed with local police to investigate homicides, but Ambrose said local and county detectives used to report to different commanding officers and would sometimes duplicate each other’s efforts.
Not all are pleased with the result. Many teachers view the movie as an unfair assault, while some leftists can't warm to Loret, a symbol of Mexico's establishment. Some commentators grouse that "De Panzazo" hits no harder than a conventional TV news story.
“We were unlucky until the 79th minute and finally luck broke through.”
We’ve got a lot of guys on this team who aren’t experienced at this time of the season and I think those first three quarters showed us a lot. We learned a lot as a team. We also learned a lot from the effort that we played with in the fourth quarter.
"I find that I'm driven more by public service and giving back," Mistry said. "What motivates me is knowing I'm making a difference in the work I'm doing, and I've found that Greencycle is one of many ways I strive to make a difference in my community."

While Kirby and Michael Simon, an assistant commissioner of the Chicago Department of Transportation, both testified that the NATO conference would bring about 50 delegations to town, they said G-8 would have brought only a few more than the eight members of the organization. However, like NATO, experts say G-8 draws delegations from many more countries than just the eight members. The 2009 G-8 in Italy drew 40 delegations, said John Kirton, director of the G-8 Research Group at the University of Toronto.
The gridlock and uncertainty are already having an impact.

The Republican governor issued a conditional veto of a Democrat-backed bill, which had sought to lower the cap on towns and schools from 4 percent to 2.9 percent with several automatic exceptions and others that could be granted by the state. In his veto message, Christie outlined changes worked out in a deal with Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester): Setting the limit at 2 percent with automatic exceptions for health care and pension costs, debt service payments, and emergencies such as severe storm damage. School districts could get exemptions for unanticipated increases in student enrollment.
Assemblyman Gordon Johnson (D-Bergen), a member of the budget committee, said that he was troubled by the contradictions in Guadagno’s testimony but that he would give her "the benefit of the doubt."
As far as I know, Richard Grenell’s wrists are firm. I can’t say the same about Romney and his team. Romney is about to become the leader of his party and, perhaps, leader of the Free World. It would be nice to see him man up and tell the medieval wing of his party that it will not dictate to him about whom he hires to run his foreign policy. Instead, as he has for months on the campaign trail, Romney continues to suck up to the anti-gay religious activists, most of whom find his Mormon beliefs repugnant.
I’m making that trip — and returning the next morning in time for a Friday evening hockey game — because when I arrive on the banks of the Three Rivers, a ticket will be waiting to see my alma mater, the Loyola Greyhounds, play in the NCAA basketball tournament.
PG&E routinely ran the pipe well above 300 pounds per inch without suffering a failure, despite the shoddy seam weld, Deaver noted. The company normally limited the San Bruno line to 375 pounds, but even that was too high in light of the line's deficient records. It also twice spiked the line to 400 pounds per square inch.

In the 1990s, high school players who were well-scouted, almost can't-miss prospects became first-round NBA draft picks. They were players like Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady. But the trend devolved into the enthronement of potential in 17-year-olds who were only age-group wonders. They were players like Kwame Brown and former Cavs Darius Miles and DeSagana Diop.

You're not going to go out and hire somebody that's going to potentially be suspended for an entire year. However, I know Gregg. I know him well.

† Finally, he should make clear the underlying problem is widening inequality. With so much disposable income and wealth going to the top, the vast middle class doesn't have the purchasing power to fire up the economy.

Not all of these various lists and marathons are strictly about an entrepreneur starting and running or business. Consider "Field of Dreams" in which Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella plows under productive land to build a baseball field. The message for entrepreneurs isn't "if you build it, they will come." In fact most entrepreneurs realize that cart-before-the-horse approach is a recipe for failure.

The missing fronds: An hour before La Jolla Presbyterian Church's Palm Sunday service, maintenance workers discovered no palm fronds had been delivered by the church's florist. Quick calls to neighboring churches brought in a few, but not nearly enough. So, as Rev.

Attendee Dan McAllister, county treasurer, called it another example of the church's resilience and creativity in the face of adversity.
