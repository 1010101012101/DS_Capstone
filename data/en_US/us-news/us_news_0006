As U.S. pop continues its march into the belly of the mainframe, the Brits are headed in the opposite direction. In the past three years, singers such as Adele, Florence Welsh, Duffy and Lauren Pritchard have been chasing a brassy throwback sound that owes more to Ray Charles and Dusty Springfield than Madonna and Michael Jackson. (Much of this has been a transparent attempt to come up with a sustainable alternative to Amy Winehouse.) It’s every bit as deliberate and constructed as the digital sound of our homegrown electropop androids, but the target is an imaginary past rather than an imaginary future.

He shouldn't be allowed near the water bottles, never mind humans who prefer their body parts kept relatively intact. Make no mistake, for every Frank Gore's head or Michael Crabtree's leg, there are other craniums and ACLs on which Williams drew specific bull's-eyes. . . . Just as Payton and pals were meeting at league headquarters with Goodell, there dropped with a thud the smoking tape made by a documentary filmmaker who followed the Saints last season. On it Williams, then the Saints defensive coordinator who has been suspended indefinitely as part of the larger inquiry, is heard imploring his players to maim specific opponents by targeting specific body parts. He did this AFTER the league had told the Saints they were being investigated for engaging in illegal pay-to-injure schemes, proving Williams' hubris stretches beyond what we thought was just a normal King of the World conceit."

We have a different view. Here's the thing, we have a different view. Or maybe it's an assumption, I should say, not view. When I said in the campaign we are going to be transparent, I believe in the 11 pages I have handed you with nine months' worth of work throughout this city, that I am on my way to fulfilling that. You've walked in with a different assumption, well that may be nice but that's not what we want you to assume. And so maybe we have to deal with what the assumption was. What I said and what you think you heard back during the campaign. I believe I am fulfilling what I am doing. I'm not done.
The governor has not said what he will do next, but his options are limited. He could try to place the tax extensions on the ballot without the Republican votes needed for a two-thirds majority, but that approach is legally questionable. He could try to gather signatures to put the taxes before the people via a ballot initiative, but if he does that, the temporary taxes will expire before the vote, so he would be asking for tax increases rather than merely preserving the status quo. That's a much tougher sell.
But the CRA is now maxed out and has no more credit available to issue bonds. The city's overall financial health is good, but the Dyer administration won't issue bonds linked to the general budget that pays for services such as police and fire protection.

The Butcher's Boy returned in "Sleeping Dogs" (1992), a sequel long on thrills but not quite up to the excellent standard set by its predecessor. (You're better off enjoying Perry's second effort, "Metzger's Dog," featuring one of the funniest, scariest examples of traffic gridlock ever committed to print.) Then the hitman went dark, and Perry honed and refined his cat-and-mouse capabilities in gems like "Pursuit" (2002), "Nightlife" (2005) and the six-book-strong Jane Whitefield novels, in which a young Native American woman disappears people as she eludes attempts to be herself disappeared by dastardly sorts.

The center's spokesman, Chris Vaccaro, said the weather service had received at least 97 reports of tornadoes by dawn Sunday and survey teams would be heading out to investigate and determine the number of actual tornadoes, their highest winds, and the width and length of their destructive paths. Several large funnel clouds and tornadoes were photographed and videographed during the outbreak.
"So we say, 'We think there's a consumer opportunity here that could be better served.' We then look at the brands we already have and the capabilities we have and we say, 'You know what?

We shuffled back to the campfire for another delight from Andrus' Dutch oven, broiled chicken. That night, we drank wine, coffee and hot chocolate and gazed up at a shower of stars that burst between the pine branches.
But linking teachers' pay directly to student performance is controversial here and nationwide. Hours after Thursday's announcement, the head of Oregon City's teachers union raised the prospect that the union -- and thus the district -- could withdraw from the program.

The heartbeat of American manufacturing was flatlining. And we had a choice to make.
The best way to serve small plates in your small space is to divide the plates by room. One dish in the living room, another in the dining room and a third in the kitchen means that as guests tire of one, they'll naturally flow to the next room. Think of it as a progressive dinner, but in the confines of your own home. It keeps guests spread out, social and interested.
Broening and Lozada-Hissom took over the cooking duties at Spuntino in March. The result, a totally charming place to have supper. (Disclosure: Broening writes for this newspaper.)
Treat your medicine like you treat your money, said Gregg Mehling, a detective with the Lorain County Drug Task Force.
Higgins is a true Portland classic. Greg Higgins has promoted restaurateur-farmer connections for years, taking on both roles when he grows vegetables, fruits and herbs for his establishment in his own garden. As a result the place serves some of the best vegetarian dishes in town. But the meat is not to be missed, and Higgins does wonders with its pates, in-house cured charcuterie, and especially a Tuscan "whole pig" plate. The restaurant can always be counted on to pair surprising ingredients with main dishes, as in rhubarb compote with duck, baked oysters with a nettle pesto, and fiddlehead ferns in an Italian bread salad. The lower level of the main dining room reminds one of a fine English club -- all wood and genteel class.
While the Kirkland has all of the characteristics that make New Zealand sauvignon blanc unique, it's on the tamer end of the spectrum. A zesty, flavorful wine, it's much softer and easier to drink. It has a clean, minerally aroma with layers of zippy lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. This is a crisp, medium-bodied white with a 13.5 percent level of alcohol and a refreshing acidity. It goes well with the pasta and asparagus recipe and also makes a good pair with fish and chicken.
A steaminess seems to hang over the stage, as actors fan themselves, remove clothes and even Edward Pierce's lighting seems hazy and hot, as if the sun itself was blasting through wooden planks in the French Quarter's bottom apartment.

Diane DaSilva, 21, said students at the College of Saint Elizabeth in Morristown would not only be affected by the elimination of $17.5 million in aid to independent colleges and universities, but also by other trims such as an 8.7 percent cut to the Educational Opportunity scholarship fund. DaSilva, a junior from Newark, said she already secured her scholarships for her senior year, but she would be devastated if she were still a freshman.

"There were many things wrong with Cleveland last season and among one of them was the fact that they couldn’t stop the run (30th in the NFL) in a division that emphasizes rushing the football. It’s a recipe for disaster if a team neglects run defense in the AFC North. The Browns tried to correct that problem by taking Hughes in the 3rd Round. He will most likely start his NFL career near the top of the depth chart with the ability to earn starting time immediately next season."
The development of curtain walls in the 1950s changed the face of cities. Previously, outside walls of buildings had to bear the weight of the structures. But steel beam construction allowed the facade of buildings to be primarily lightweight metal and glass, allowing for more creativity in design.
Farm-related stores have moved into some of the locations that border on rural areas. For example, a Rural King moved into the Value City location in Collinsville. And a Farm and Home Supply opened at the Alton site.

“I would like to think so,” Hawks forward Marvin Williams said before Game 2. “I think everybody understands what’s at stake at this point.”
The size of the seats is not a function of passenger weight but a legacy of airplane design from a generation ago, said Vern Alg, a former airline executive who is now a private consultant. "The restriction is the dimension, the width of the aircraft," he said. "With Boeing narrow bodies, for example, if they are going to have six seats across, they can only be 17.1 inches wide."
This confession business is tricky, however.
How does this revelation affect the 2011 field? Eminem is the oldest nominee, and he’s definitely male. He fits the profile of an Album of the Year winner — he’s been kicking around the Grammy lists since “The Slim Shady LP” won Best Rap Album in ‘99. At 24, Lady Gaga is the youngest in the field. But she’s not exactly an ingenue — she’s a known quantity. Morissette came out of nowhere, or Canada; Gaga feels like she’s been on magazine covers forever. The “Bad Romance” singer gets the 10 points, but a little grudgingly.
The tour that starts Friday includes Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Thailand. Organizers say Kim will high-five everyone at fan events in Hong Kong and Taiwan, too.
Sharp guitar strumming and a distinct beat arrangement supplemented "Back on the Chain Gang," a song that highlighted the country influences on many of the band's songs.
This would make it more difficult for foreign countries to cut production to force up prices. The potentially unreliable countries of North Africa and the Persian Gulf, Venezuela and Nigeria supply a combined total of 5 million barrels a day -- about a quarter of U.S. consumption. That is the amount we ought to replace with an increase in our own domestic production.
If possible, switch fluorescent lighting with flourescents that provide full spectrum light such as Vita-Lite & Vita Brite Full Spectrum Lighting. High-hats (down lighting) or other overhead lighting that provides warmer colored light is another alternative. If replacing fluorescents is impossible, try replacing the cool white bulbs with pink ones. It will not reduce stress levels associated with X-rays or flickers, but it may provide a warmer, more natural light source.

By winning the LPGA Championship in dominating style Sunday, the 22-year-old from Taiwan became the youngest to win four LPGA majors.

For a true home theater experience, don’t forget to invest in a pair (or a few pairs) of blackout curtains. These look just like standard window coverings, but they’re lined so they block out most, if not all, of the light outside -- which makes it easy to darken your room any time of day. Add a cozy blanket, popcorn and soda to complete the experience.

City schools Superintendent Kelvin Adams has said he supports Slay's efforts on charters as long as they result in quality schools, and not more substandard ones. Even so, the district has fought the mayor's attempt to play a more active role in the charter school movement by lobbying against legislation that would have allowed Slay to sponsor schools. The Legislature so far has agreed, with the House voting against the idea last week.

And, hoping for lots of kind-hearted people to come out, many more pets will join Bunny, Bella and Angel on Saturday. The dogs will be on leash, the better to meet everyone, while the cats will be in a trailer where they can see out and visitors can come in and meet them.
"If we have a noon game, we won't be able to do as much, but he keeps it pretty consistent," Kovacs said. "We have so many meetings, we don't have time to do anything. The longest break you'll have is 45 minutes then you go back to the room and watch football and try to take a nap and find something to kill the time. My biggest thing is I try to take my mind off football, forget about the game, watch some TV and relax. Then go through walkthroughs and you can start thinking about the game."
The winter solstice is the arrival of winter. The solstice is the moment the tilt of the northern hemisphere of the Earth points farthest from the sun. Most of the world's calendar makers and timekeepers use Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, to note the moment.

For all the trouble that Baltimore Racing Development is in now, the race was at a basic level a positive event for the city. Some 160,000 people attended over three days during Labor Day weekend. The course was exciting and beautiful, and locals and out-of-town visitors alike had a good time. It produced a $47 million economic impact for the city — a far cry from what race organizers promised, but still not an insignificant amount. Repairs to the streets downtown before the race were a huge headache for commuters, but the race itself produced less chaos than many feared.

Doctorow gives us Sherman - unstable but brilliant, determined to be one with his soldiers, yet somewhat detached. And he weaves a slew of other characters into the mix, too: Pearl, the pretty young former slave who attracts the attention of the Union soldiers; Colonel Sartorius, the field surgeon for whom amputation is the only answer to many injuries (Satorius will be familiar to readers as the evil genius in Doctorow's earlier novel, The Water Works); Emily Thompson, the southern aristocrat and daughter of a judge who becomes the doctor's assistant; Arly and Will, a pair of Confederate soldiers who might have been dreamed up by Mark Twain; and even one Coalhouse Walker Sr. (father to the black jazz pianist who figures so prominently in "Ragtime").

Increasingly, the world belongs to those collecting capital gains. They're the ones who demanded and got massive tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 on the false promise that the gains would "trickle down" to everyone else in the form of more jobs and better wages. They're now advocating austerity economics on the false premise that cuts in public spending -- including education, infrastructure and safety nets -- will generate more "confidence" and "certainty" among lenders and investors, and also lead to more jobs and better wages.

These stand in dramatic contrast to some of the earthier main courses, such as the well-charred filet mignon ($32), served on a generous bed of Blue Lake green beans and doused in a classic peppercorn sauce. It's crowded onto the plate with a pile of thick-cut fries and a breadcrumbed tomato half. Poached halibut ($26) is a simple masterpiece. The moist white fish is surrounded by a thin saffron broth and decorated with minute dices of carrots and paper-thin slices of fennel cut lengthwise so that the ends splay out like a sea creature with tentacles. Sauteed monkfish ($29) is served with prawn risotto with a Parmesan tuille, a scattering of baby greens and a pool of rich lobster bisque.

Finally, allies suggest that the gas tax will generate new infrastructure projects that create thousands of construction industry jobs. Clearly, that industry has suffered. However, this jobs benefit ignores the offsetting employment loss that will occur in other industries. A 15-cents-per-gallon increase would give Maryland the highest fuel tax in our region and would cost one truck driver an extra $3,000 per year. Imposing such a dramatic cost on local truckers will cause many companies to lay off workers or join the thousands that closed their doors during the recession. Many businesses are pulling out of a deep hole, but rates are still depressed and the recovery is fragile.

9) Thirty years ago, Haiti imported no rice, one of the staples of the Haitian diet. Today, almost all of the rice consumed in Haiti is imported. Why? Because when Haiti borrowed money from through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it was forced to open its markets to the world. The U.S. then destroyed the Haitian agricultural system by sending heavily subsidized rice and sugar into Haiti. When food riots broke out in Haiti in 2008, after a spike in worldwide rice prices, an article in the New York Times scolded that Haiti, "it's agricultural industry in shambles, needs to better feed itself." No mention was made of the global market forces that helped to destroy that industry. It's a pattern that has been repeated in many countries. To understand it even

While the rest of the industry gave ground, Cake held fast: "Showroom" sold very close to the number of albums "Pressure Chief" did seven years ago. McCrea considers it appropriate that "Showroom" was the lowest-selling No. 1 album in the history of the Billboard charts. They’ve made it to the summit with gloom, pessimism ("Every shiny toy that once brought you joy/Will soon begin to cloy and annoy" is a typical lyric from the new set) and a modest, self-effacing sound. Where other rock guitarists strum power chords, Cake’s Xan McCurdy — one of the true six-string originals working in contemporary pop — picks out scratchy lines and tiny, funky, broken chords.

Gov.Martin O'Malley's proposal for a 6 percent sales tax on gas is a bad idea. With the current 23.5 cents per gallon tax, consumers are already struggling to make ends meet. When a Maryland citizen doesn't have enough money to pay his bills, he is forced to cut his spending and adjust his budget. As steward of the public treasury, the same standard should be applied to our governor.

Despite these different perspectives, Obama presented Israel with a strong case for patience. Sanctions, he said, are "slowing the Iranian nuclear program and virtually grinding the Iranian economy to a halt." They also may have drawn Iran back to the negotiating table; on Tuesday it was announced that negotiations would be resumed between Tehran and the U.S., France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. It is far too early to give up on diplomacy — or, as Obama said at his news conference, "this notion that somehow we have a choice to make in the next week or two weeks, or month or two months, is not borne out by the facts."

MH: Books about the Templars fall into two categories. Some are strictly history and confine themselves to the two centuries of the Templars' existence. Others are speculative and deal in the many stories surrounding the Templars, in what you might call the afterlife of the Templars that continues in the popular imagination to this day. I wanted to take a serious look at both the history and the mythic afterlife and to show how they are intimately related and always have been -- how the Templars became the subject of popular imagination already at their inception, celebrities, you might say, the superstars of the Middle Ages.

ø•He's already got his stolen base total into double-digits - can Starlin Castro keep up this pace? His speed skills are consistent with years past; what's different is that he's running much more frequently. While he ran less than 20% when reached first base in 2010-11, he's taking off more than 50% of the time in 2012. That rate is unsustainable, especially since his success rate (about 70%) is nothing special. Castro certainly looks like he'll beat last year's career-best total of 22 steals. But he's not going to double that number, despite his early pace.

"What's surprising is the breadth of support that these (issues) are the most important to children's health and the consensus that it's up to the community  not just the parents  to be involved," said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo.

Some are concerned that OCN represents an advocacy site and not a news service. Oregonian Editor Peter Bhatia wrote on Sunday that we have vetted their coverage.

The most disgusting part of all this is that it took 27 years for Bennett to get this far. Plenty of people — including justice advocates from Florida to Washington, D.C — have asked Gov. Charlie Crist, Attorney General Bill McCollum and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger to call for an independent investigation into whether more people were wrongfully convicted. But perhaps because the people rotting wrongfully in prison cells were simply regular Joes — rather than muckety-mucks or campaign-check writers — all three career politicians have ignored the calls for justice.

Beth is initially suspicious of him, but then she gets a glimpse of Logan tossing heavy bags of dog food around, all sensitive man sweat and decorously smudged dirt on his forehead, and from that point on she's a goner.

The three-hour eco-tour features narration by a marine biologist, who helps point out the array of birds and other Florida critters and explains the "catch" hauled aboard on an otter trawl or shrimp net. After passengers view the wildlife, the catch is released back into the ocean. There's less science involved in the BYOB cruise, where passengers can sip the beverage of their choice, listen to live music and watch the landscape and sunset, which also qualifies as one of the area's natural wonders.
But there were no complaints from the divers once they arrived in Tijuana and set eyes on the facility.

Step Three: Think long-term. It's relatively easy to paper over a one-year deficit, but if legislators are serious about eliminating the state's structural shortfall, it requires permanent taxes or permanent spending cuts. What are the state's priorities? Is it outstanding public schools or slightly lower tax rates? Job creation or happy county executives and councils?

Cell phone makers often give U.S. carriers exclusive rights to sell a model, but usually only for six months or so. Apple signed a multi-year contract with AT&T, probably so AT&T would carry a phone that broke many industry rules. Apple had complete control over the software on the phone, and it was linked to Apple's music and video stores, not AT&T's. When the App Store came along a year later, that was completely controlled by Apple as well.

Let's start with the dining credit: You could be conservative and squeeze out two meals or splurge on a special Titanic Tea for two ($47 per person, 1-3 p.m. May 12). The free cocktails usually cost $12-$15 each, and the free Titanic tickets usually cost $27 each. So provided you spend down the credit and take advantage of the extras, the room cost comes out to about $121 plus tax a night.

TOYOTA TROUBLES: Bad publicity from the recalls, mainly for cars that can accelerate without warning, was hurting Toyota long before the earthquake. The recalls began late in 2009, and came just as GM, Ford, Hyundai, and others introduced more competitive cars and trucks. With a bunch of nice alternatives and doubts about quality, customers who dutifully returned to Toyota started considering other brands. Many Toyota models look old and need upgrades. Despite rebates and low-interest financing, Toyota was the only major automaker with lower U.S. sales last year. Sales are up 12.5 percent so far in 2011, but only at half the growth of GM.

In their first nine games, the Indians hit 16 homers. They haven't hit one in the past 10. It's their longest homerless streak in almost 30 years. They went 14 games without a homer in 1983 from Aug. 10 through Aug. 27.

This demand for perfection, of course, sets me up for a painful belly flop. In fact, I wonder how many times I sat in my cozy red chair by the fireplace late Christmas Day, after the last family member has whooshed out the front door, feeling as empty as the boxes that litter the great room. Christmas is over, I realize, and I missed it.
Kovalchuk's injury opened a roster spot for Larsson, a rookie defenseman, to be activated. Larsson was a first-round pick last year, and is just 19 years old. He had two goals and 18 points in his first NHL season, but had not played a playoff game yet. Larsson's shot from the circle beat Bryzgalov on his glove side early in the third for the tying goal.
The cap for classes in grades K-3 will shift from 20 to 22, she said, and the limit for grades 4-5 will move from 24 to 26. Bastnagel said that’s still smaller than most districts, but potentially troubling for kids whose rise into fourth grade coincides with the changes.

Under Bloomberg, the city has recovered over $85 million in benefits and defaulted over 105 projects that reneged on terms. "We do have a tremendous compliance department that spends all of their time making sure the companies are doing what they are supposed to do," Pinsky testified during the March 21 hearing.

Piracy hosted by US-based sites is actually under control. Sites like YouTube aren't required to police what their users do, so long as they have a process for reviewing and removing pirated content after the copyrightholder calls the violation to their attention.
I think the league is ecstatic. This is the first stadium built just for pro football in the history of California. If you look at the other ones, Qualcomm Stadium (in San Diego) was for baseball, Candlestick Park was for baseball, the Coliseum in Oakland was built for baseball and mixed use. In Southern California, the Coliseum and Rose Bowl, those were for the Olympics and college sports. This is the first building just for pro football and it speaks volumes for the amount of work that went into it. California has been such a great market and we just haven't had the venues to host the great American sporting event (the Super Bowl).
Obama said the change of heart had nothing to do with security or concerns that Chicago couldn't handle such a sprawling event.
Erb said the Apple devices that support Cherokee are most popular with students, but the technology is slowly gaining traction with older tribal members, especially those who might not like using computers but routinely use cell phones.
CLEANING UP (6): If Beltran, the birthday boy, starts at cleanup this evening – and Matheny has given every indication that Beltran will stick there for awhile – he'll have more starts than any teammate at two spots in the order – No. 2 and No. 4. That's not unusual for the switch-hitter. Beltran has more than 450 plate appearances in his career at each of the top five positions in the lineup, and he has more than 1,000 plate appearances at three different spots in the order. How he's done at each spot in the order:
The Zambrano saga already has enough chapters to fill a book, which would then be made into a Quentin Tarantino movie. He tried the patience of three managers, all of whom defended his boorish behavior at first, only to get kicked in the gut by his lack of respect for authority. The general manager who handed Zambrano a $91.5 million contract didn't even get a phone call when he decided to "retire" after walking out on the team in Atlanta last August.
While they were there, students at one school kept a blog that brimmed with enthusiasm.
On the other hand, when retailers close stores and lay off workers, that hurts their customer service scores because shoppers report that there are fewer workers around to help them and that "I was waiting in line longer than I usually do," VanAmburg said.
10-6 Seattle, Key Arena at Seattle Center
On the flip side, a different reason I'm fine with The Rock staying away for periods of time is because I'm already starting to remember why I got tired of The Rock in the first place – The Attitude Era, as successful as it was, was also the era of overbearing repetition. Even with new catchphrases and techniques, The Rock has already become stale in certain areas. For example, the “(insert phrase here)? Trending on Twitter Worldwide!” game, despite it's effectiveness, is already played out – not to say The Rock (or, as John Cena would tell you, “Brian”) won't be able to think of more funny material, but that time is rapidly approaching.

That's because his father is Ken Williams, the longtime general manager of the White Sox. And while the Williams men have excelled in both sports, they all ultimately picked baseball -except for Kyle.
FEMA announced in 2007 that it would reclassify most of the flood plain as high-risk because the Army Corps of Engineers would not certify that the levees would withstand a 100-year flood, although they were designed to protect against a 500-year flood. The map changes would mean new restrictions on development and force many business and home owners to buy costly flood insurance.

How would the club teach its lessons? Would the audience participate? Would they take off any items of their clothing? What tools would be used to conduct procedures?
It’s not clear why older people reported fewer sleep disturbances and tiredness, the authors said. It could be that older people have more control over sleep duration while younger people experience more stressors (jobs, kids, socializing) that interfere with sleep. It’s also possible that older people are just more accepting of sleep quality and don’t complain about it as much.

"I just don't believe that that kind of divisiveness based on religion has a place in this country."

Tobias Meyer, the Sotheby's auctioneer who commanded Wednesday night's $119.9 million sale of the 1895 Norwegian icon "The Scream," was cool as a winter fiord when he slammed the gavel on the most expensive work ever sold at auction. It was only later, at 3 a.m., that the moment got to him.
If a politician changes his position — but not the philosophy behind it — it may simply be an evolution of thought. People can and should grow. I certainly hope that one of my least favorite politicians, the late West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, changed his positions from what they were when he created a wing of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s.
The guy who unintentionally coined the term Gen X is staying out of the fray. Douglas Couplan, the Canadian novelist whose first novel, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture," stamped the term in the cultural zeitgeist after it was published in 1991, is mum about the next generation.
The group's anything-goes-and-usually-does approach was what first caught the ear of 15-year-old drummer Tom Ardolino, who sent a fan letter to keyboardist Terry Adams after catching one of the group's shows in Springfield, Mass.

It might be useful to take a step back in understanding that the site of the Battle of Princeton counterattack was envisioned from the beginning to be a vital part of Princeton Battlefield State Park. In 1944, C.S. Sincerbeaux prepared a map showing Washington’s counterattack on what is now the proposed faculty housing site. This map became the basis for Gov. Walter Edge’s park boundary lines. The Institute for Advanced Study received a copy of the map and indicated that it was favorably disposed to working with the governor in putting the park together. Then, in 1945, the institute purchased 129.99 acres from Robert Maxwell, including the site of the counterattack — a site that Gov. Edge passionately wanted to be in the park. In 1947, Mr. Maxell and Mrs. Agnes Pyne Hudson both gave property to the park; other parcels were purchased, some acquired under the threat of eminent domain.

Same-sex relationships exist. Parents already have to navigate conversations about Johnny's two dads and why two women live together next door or why two men are holding hands at the market. The conversations can be just as awkward as explaining why Macy doesn't live with both her parents anymore, and why Macy and her mom are no longer free for play dates because her mom has to work more now that her dad has left. And parents are grappling with decisions about sleepovers between their high school daughter and their daughter's lesbian friend.

Meanwhile in Washington, the just-passed liquor law there privatizing liquor sales and ending the state's liquor monopoly is being challenged. Get this: Desperate to get their way and unable to successfully fight the merits of privatization with scare tactics, the initiative's opponents are saying the law voters approved in November violates the single-subject rule for legislative bills and ballot initiatives under the Washington Constitution. The state's constitution says no bill "shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title."
My aunt was a high school field hockey coach, and I remember seeing her coach some games and looking at the goalie and what they have to wear. I was like, "Who would every want to be a goalie?

Most of my financial portfolio is held by a major brokerage house with accounts in stocks, bonds and mutual funds.

Might there be another suggestion?
The biggest cheer after Alomar popped out of the dugout went to Browns president Mike Holmgren, who was sitting behind the Indians dugout and popped up, larger than life, on the Jumbotron in the middle of the fifth inning.

Mother's Day is the perfect time to pause and celebrate not only our mothers but also the generosity of our community and how the Pacifica Resource Center helps spread that generosity to those that need it most. Now is the perfect time to reflect on the sobering fact that one in ten Pacificans earns less than $25,000 a year, and 1 in 4 Pacificans are eligible for — but in many cases do not receive — public and private benefits, such as CalFresh (California's food stamp program), utility assistance, and housing or child care subsidies.
