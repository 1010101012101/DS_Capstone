Editor - Our first memory of the Gay Freedom Day parade was attending our first parade in June 1975. We had met in March, fell in love and, in May, decided to become domestic partners. The parade was our first time out in the nongay world as a couple. The parade was only about three blocks long and consisted of several decorated cars carrying mostly drag queens and the Royal Court, a makeshift band, no floats except for a decorated pickup truck blaring music, and lots of individuals marching with signs proclaiming gay rights. The only woman in the parade was in the band. The bystanders along the parade route ranged from gay men who did not want to march and identify themselves as gay, folks yelling anti-gay remarks and tourists who found the parade interesting and confusing. The only positive part of the route was on Polk street, which was the "Castro" of the time.

A series of posters from the famed Willi's Wine Bar in Paris gives some color to the deep chocolate walls. Dark bentwood chairs complete the classic wine-bar look. What you can't see when you walk in is a side patio trimmed in ornate black ironwork and a spacious back garden. Combined, they more than double the seating.

A: Augusta was more difficult. It played really long because the golf course was wet, and you didn't get any roll out there. One of the days, I had a little wind and the really makes the golf course hard because it makes it hard to hit your landing areas and your landing areas are really precise out there. The greens are very tricky. They really reward being on the correct side of the hole location, and if you aren't on the correct side, then you are going to have a really hard time two putting or getting up and down, so there is a premium on hitting fairways and greens and hitting the greens in the right spot.

11. Contact the manufacturer. Parts for older home products can be hard to find. If your local repair tech can't find parts that match or fit the piece you want to repair, contact the manufacturer. Some makers of windows and other building/remodeling materials keep old parts on hand.

Thomas is 38, his no-trade clause expires in July, and the 25-year-old Rask is considered the goaltender of the future. There is also a backup for Rask in place in Khudobin, who will be on a one-way deal next year and would be exposed to waivers if the Bruins try to send him to Providence (where he’d make his full NHL salary of $800,000), should they decide to keep both Thomas and Rask.

Lavish by company standards, Minnesota Opera's production, which includes a violent battle scene that manages not to be hokey, is all one could wish.

"The district has not found a way to save those positions," said Gina Potter, the district's assistant superintendent of business services. "Almost all are state or federal funded with categorical funding. The state has not let the district know how much money they're going to be able to give us for the coming school year. And because we don't know how much money we are going to get, we had to do layoffs until we get an award letter from the state. Last year, that letter came in July. We hope (the letter) comes in time to rehire people."

Before the vote, Potter and Commissioner Randy Leonard wrote a resolution demanding more civilian oversight. They wanted the federal government to grant the mayor, the police chief and the city attorney the same security clearance as task force officers.

Notes: The OSU defense was a wrecking crew. Starting outside linebackers Cameron Collins and Michael Doctor combined for 16 tackles. Defensive tackle Dominic Glover, who looked unblockable, had two sacks and three tackles for loss. … Riley said Vaz, “looked sharp, especially early. But it dwindled down a little bit when we got into red zone plays. We tried to force too many balls into the end zone. … prior to that, there was a lot of good stuff on third down. Cody made a lot of plays. Same with Mannion, but he also (forced) some throws.’’ … Riley on the offensive line: “I thought the first group today, running the ball, protecting the quarterback, was very good. It got sloppy after that.’’ … Riley on James Rodgers: “Nobody knows. Nobody can predict (when he’ll come back) but it sounds to me like he’s ahead of schedule. … Bishop should be OK, Halahuni should be OK (with or without the surgery). So that’s all we can do (wait and see what happens).’’ … OSU was without backup center Roman Sapolu, who sprained an ankle Wednesday and was on crutches. … freshman running back Terron Ward, slowed in recent practices by a sore knee, will be scoped on Monday. … Riley said he will be at league meetings Monday, then will be on campus to conduct individual player meetings. His staff will be out recruiting.

But for other studies, just figuring out when the market got wind of the event is a lot harder than it looks. For instance, several studies of investors' reaction to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which tightened accounting rules, arrived at contradictory results. Whether researchers found that investors cheered or booed the act depended on when during its protracted passage people believed the act was inevitable. Similar uncertainty abounds around the current health-care legislation, confounding efforts to read reaction to the overhaul.

The 1,500-foot safety zone established around the 282-foot barge would have been too small if a leak occurred, the spill response agencies said in the debriefing.

To be perfectly clear, the horse-racing industry isn't considering such a change. Since the early 18th century, when this sport became professionalized in England, horses in competition have traditionally been piloted by small, wiry humans. The sight of jockeys in their silks and goggles is as much a part of the track-day scenery as betting windows, decorative hats and the mint julep.
The entire interpretation was summmed up by the final chord played by the normally reliable woodwinds. Bernstein built the interval of a tritone (sounded in the opening of "Maria" and used to bind the piece together) into that final sonority. On this occasion, however, that chord just sounded out of tune rather than unresolved.
Second, Livermore said, is a failure among those doing the analyzing to disclose the assumptions and limitations of their models -- and the willingness of politicians (and the media, for that matter) to treat the resulting figures as gospel rather than guesstimate.

The 10 positions would cost about $563,500, based on the district's average teacher salary of $56,350, not including benefits, Griggs said.
The Indians' "What If" also is the set-up for a punch line. What if the Dolans actually sprang for a hitter at the trading deadline? What if a franchise that had traded away not one but two Cy Young winners, actually unlimbered the wallet? "What if" aspires to wishful thinking, but currently, despite fantasy league pitching incarnate, it invites cynicism or at the least, reasonable doubt.

"Everybody that starts for us this fall was a part of the run we made last year, and every one of them was there in Week 12 when we lost that final game," Koch said. "They know what it feels like to lose that big of a game and it's fueled their offseason. In my five years here this has been hands-down our most complete offseason from a team aspect.

It's hard to resist a kitchen that does such a good job with classics like steamed mussels. Here, the plump, sweet mollusks are steamed in Riesling, which gives the broth a zingy acidity. At Public Kitchen, a good many dishes are designed for sharing. Well before anybody else was doing it, Goodell was sending out French canning jars filled with foie gras. He's doing something similar here with a smooth chicken liver terrine paired with a puckery rhubarb marmalade.
Fischer said that the family had trouble keeping track of Doyle because the Petersons kept moving him around. In 2008, her family learned about the problems with the other Peterson guardianships.

The two followed it up with a Louis van Amstel (of Dancing with the Stars fame) Cha-Cha, that the judges hated a lot more then I did. Nigel called Ryan sloppy. "I felt as though you were overdoing it, over-egging the pudding," he told her. Mary apologized to her as she put only Ricky (who was flawless) on the Hot Tamale Train. As for me, I feel like it's the Cha-cha. It's the kiss of death on this show. Over dancing it was Ryan's only shot of getting through to the audience.

Less is more: "Don't put everything on the table. The trend to incorporate props on a tabletop is at an all-time high. But make sure to keep an edited eye.
