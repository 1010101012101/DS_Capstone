Early experiences taught Keller to treat each ingredient with care and respect. He recalls the time he accidentally snapped the leg of a rabbit when he reached into the cage to grab it and didn't have a proper grip. He still remembers the squeal of pain, but that gruesome incident became a defining moment in shaping his approach to food -- every element is treated with dignity, and cooked in a way that celebrates it. Keller is one of the most thoughtful and precise of chefs, and it shows in every preparation. He's so exacting and particular that he has designed just about every plate and serving piece in the restaurant. About a year ago, he raised his menu price from $115 to $175, and recently also added an automatic gratuity, which is split among the staff -- much as Chez Panisse has been doing for years. While the price is formidable, with Keller's culinary genius and Laura Cunningham's front-of-the-house magic, the experience is well worth the extra dollars. The menu changes anywhere from 30 to 60 percent a night, depending on what's fresh that day.

As Cooper tells it, he first tasted mezcal in the 1970s while road-tripping through Mexico. On return trips to Oaxaca, where most mezcal is made, he sought out palenqueros, or mezcal makers, and collected rare bottles. But the spirit he loved was hard to come by in the U.S., so he started Del Maguey in 1995 to import it.

That's why Thursday's action was so key. The Federal Transit Administration wants better estimates on costs and ridership before it will consider the project for funding. The extra funding will pay for studies that look closer at environmental effects, station designs, tunnel work and support services. And the two years required for this work will give county leaders time to mull over possible new sources of revenue to fill in the funding gaps.
Health officials have been paying especially close attention to cholera infection rates in Haiti as it heads into the rainy season, when conditions are ripe for the spread of the waterborne disease because of a paltry sewage and sanitation system.

Allan Vogelson Regional library in Voorhees Brahms added, “We collect all types of books, year round, for reuse including the library’s on-going and large book sales, but this is an extra initiative to target school-age books and unused books that will aid the school and the library’s book sale.”
Not only will our children still learn from their teachers, our streets still be guarded and house fires still extinguished, the best and the brightest -- not just someone who's been on the payroll for decades -- will be out there getting the job done.

Making a big impact is no easy task for an editor.
Copeland argued that in the Webster Groves case, St. Louis County Circuit Court Judge Barbara Wallace denied the school district a hearing before ordering in June that King-Willmann be immediately enrolled.

The main goal of immigration reform efforts should not be providing an automatic pathway to citizenship for particular groups of undocumented immigrants. It should be to allow mostly honest, hard-working people who had few other options in coming to America to come out of the shadows, reside legally and breathe freely in the United States. Citizenship should not be out of the question, assuming appropriate criteria are met, but it is a separate issue.
A Star-Ledger report last month focused on another clinic, Compassionate Care Centers of America Foundation, and its ties to a wealthy Monmouth County man accused of benefiting from a massive Ponzi scheme.

It opens with a woman saying, "My boyfriend and I were going on vacation." She appears to be in a clothing store and needs to get a few accessories. With her Citi card, of course. Then the scene changes. She picks out "a new belt" (it's a rock-climbing harness) and "some nylons" (rock-climbing ropes). "And what girl wouldn't need new shoes?" she asks. (For rock-climbing, of course.)
Santorini is run by the same family behind Walnut Creek's Silk Road and Pomegranate -- executive chef Toni Sohi, who has paired up on the venture with co-owner David Badrkhani -- and it's easy to see that these are restaurateurs with a clue. The pacing and plating are polished, the servers warm and friendly. And the food? The food is pretty fantastic.
Dayton's most important stadium meeting Friday likely will be with House Speaker Kurt Zellers, whose support would be a major boost for the plan. Zellers has been vague on how much he will do to push the stadium, and there are doubts the project can win approval without his help.

The housing market's boom and bust exposed stunning flaws in the housing finance system, from lax underwriting to sloppy record-keeping to incompetent loan servicing. California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris is pushing lawmakers to incorporate some of the lessons learned into a new state law governing foreclosures, but lenders are resisting, arguing that the mortgage meltdown was just a "temporary" crisis that doesn't justify a permanent change in law. That's wishful thinking, and legislators should give troubled borrowers more protection against lenders' procedural shortcuts.

Dwight C. Holton, an assistant U.S. attorney, has been named as the interim U.S. attorney for Oregon, officials confirmed this morning.
It's one thing to channel style icons of years past -- Dita Von Teese makes a living off it -- but it's another to appropriate a red carpet look that's only four years old. It's doubtful that Emma Stone realized she was doing this when she donned an admittedly beautiful Giambattista Valli gown for the 2012 Oscars, but any fashion insider who wasn't too addled by Jennifer Lopez's cleavage or Stacy Keibler's retina-searing gold lame could instantly see the DNA of Nicole Kidman's 2008 Balenciaga in Stone's gown.

My grandmother's coconut cream pie is made from a cooked custard similar to a creme anglais, which is thickened with egg yolks and corn starch. The thick custard then is poured into a prebaked pie shell, topped with meringue and baked. But as much as I love that pie, I felt the need to tinker. I wanted the same flavors, but with less work.

No team with a fourteen seed, including the Peacocks (20-13) of SPC, is going to find a tournament game with a number three seed anything but an uphill battle. Purdue is a formidable opponent with a record of 25-7 and a rank of fifteen in the latest USA Today TOP 25 Coaches Poll. They have defeated top-ranked Ohio State and Big Ten powers Wisconsin and Michigan State. They also have the Big Ten player of the year in 6’10” JaJuan Johnson, a likely top ten selection in the next NBA draft, according to SPC Coach John Dunne.

Notebook: Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said forward Joakim Noah is doubtful for Game 4 today against the 76ers because of a sprained ankle. Noah got hurt midway through the third quarter of Friday night's loss at Philadelphia. He played briefly in the fourth quarter, before leaving the arena on crutches. The eighth-seeded Sixers lead the series 2-1, winning both games after Chicago's Derrick Rose tore a knee ligament and went down for the playoffs.
Filmed entertainment revenues decreased 5 percent to $1.17 billion, reflecting lower theatrical and television license fee revenues, which were partially offset by higher ancillary revenues.Â Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 19 percent as a slate of films, which were generally not as widely distributed as those released in the same quarter last year, failed to match the previous' films success. The recent quarter's releases included "The Devil Inside," "Jeff, Who Lives at Home," and the box-office bomb "A Thousand Words." The previous quarter's included such hits as "Rango" and "Justin Bieber: Never Say Never."

Paisley is, as every fan of country music knows, an astonishingly expressive guitarist, able to squeeze passages of novelty and beauty out of his instrument. The same might be said of Sierra Hull, a prodigious mandolin player who is barely out of her teens and currently on a scholarship at Berklee. The Nashville establishment doesn't have much time for bluegrass or newgrass, and in this case (and many others) it's Music City's loss: Hull has the charisma of a star and the interpretive skill of a 30-year veteran. On "Best Buy," a standout from "Daybreak," she even tries her hand at a little Western swing; like everything else she tries, it's a winner. And when she fires up the band for an instrumental, as she does on "Bombshell," the results are jaw-dropping.

With his relentless emphasis on pacing, Fiennes’ film loses something of the classic’s depth and power; events that should unfold gradually seem to spring to life within moments.

People using wheelchairs and walkers can easily traverse the playground's rubber-tiled surface.
"If they come, we will win," Lugar said.
Financier Warren Buffet has energized liberals with his still-unverified claim that his tax rate lags his secretary's. If true, "fairness" could mean slashing his secretary's taxes to match Buffet's 11 percent effective tax rate. Somehow, reducing the secretary's taxes never came up.

It's highly doubtful that RPM will be the only organization to make a change over the next few weeks.

As a result, our clients have been extremely helpful in working with us and moving business away from the more expensive participant in this network. And at the end of last year, we said we were confident that 95% of our script volume was going to continue into 2012 without Walgreens. We're a week now into the year.

We have also had to adapt to working with less staff and fewer resources. Yet politicians would point the finger of blame at us and our unions with one hand while handing out tax breaks to big businesses with the other.

There is no victory in sight, no chance to defeat the Taliban, no reason to continue to engage in a fragile and contentious alliance with a regional thug like Hamid Karzai, no rational explanation of why we continue to send our best soldiers into a war they have no chance to win if we stay in the hills of Afghanistan forever.

But a court someday is going to put a number on the neglect the league demonstrated for years.

Nor will we until we have this meeting. I can tell you this morning I've had calls from players and agents that they want to participate and would be more than happy to join in at this point. We'll look at all those possibilities and we'll find out if there's interest before we extend any invitation."

Tyson Chandler. Chandler will be the most prominent free agent in this year’s class, and in a normal year, he would be a no-brainer to re-sign in Dallas. But Chandler himself admitted that the new, tougher rules governing the luxury tax mean that the Mavs will probably have to let him walk. He could go from the world champs to Minnesota in the space of six months.

Much is being made of Romney's gaping gender gap, yet the gender gap is one of the most persistent features of our politics. Women always support Democrats more than men do. In 2008, President Obama won 56 percent of women and 49 percent of men, for a 7-point difference. In 2004, John Kerry won 51 percent of women and 44 percent of men, for a 7-point difference.

Phillips' paintings have a high initial impact but also look thin and unfinished, as if she were a facile writer satisfied with a first draft. This quality is emphasized by the artist's frequent use of large areas of flat, uninflected color -- usually in her skies -- which tend to impart a sense that she's coasting.

Robyn Celia runs Pappy & Harriet's saloon and restaurant 53 miles away from the festival in Pioneertown. The desert denizens, she said, take a curious rather than defensive approach to Coachella revelers. "They've never been anything but welcoming to the out-of-towners. They get a kick out of it. I think the locals think it's hilarious. It's not something they're going to see at Applebee's."

There was a guy who would send tweets to me, Ralph Vacchiano of the Daily News, Tom Rock of Newsday, Paul Schwartz of the Post and Pat Hanlon of the Giants on pretty much a daily basis.

As an anthropologist with personal ties to the problem of addiction, I have studied the social and historical influences of drug use, and that has made me skeptical about the idea of a vaccine. Entrenched poverty, social inequality and personal despair all promote drug use, and these things profoundly shape the unequal outcomes of the addicted. Where I lived and worked, illicit drugs were more available than mental health services, and heroin was often used as a "medicine" to relieve the suffering of everyday life.
If you've succeeded at what you set out to accomplish, then it's time to reward yourself. We want you to treat yourself to something special. Perhaps a massage, a new outfit, a mini-holiday or a day off will do the trick.

The Jordan Brand, which like its parent is based at the World Headquarters campus near Beaverton, has not said what marketing plans are in store for its new signee. But a University of Portland marketing professor, where they know a thing or two about successful women's athletic programs, sees opportunity in the signing. Moore might be just what Nike, Inc., needs for continued growth in the U.S. market.
Eight teams from each of two conferences qualify for the playoffs.

On Tuesday, Richie reposted on his website what he said were some of Quayle's original contributions.
In the end, that's really what this list is about. You may love your favorite bar for reasons only you can explain — maybe it's across the street from your office, or it's where you set a personal best on Golden Tee, or it's where you were sitting that magical night in 1998 when you first looked deep into your future wife's eyes and told her you loved Scott Brosius.
Sorry, got distracted there. Tenley's helicopter lands. Chris Harrison escorts her like a lamb to the slaughter. She's lovely in a strapless golden gown. She feels positive her new life with Jake begins today. She and Jake stand face to face on a flower-bedecked veranda overlooking the water. Jake tells her how perfect she is, then gets teary when dropping the bomb. "I don't know what it is," he says. "Something doesn't feel right." Classy to the end, Tenley is tearful and upset but says, "I don't know what you think is missing, but thank you for showing me what I could have." Sob! "I was able to give my heart to you and I'm not sad that I did." Sob! Sniff! "But thank you for making me feel special."
A:I had lunch with a 73-year-old who was a Little in the 1940s. He had great stories to tell about the impact it has. He is now becoming a Big and was matched with a 6-year-old. That's really neat. The perception is that this is only for people in their 20s, but that's not true. Mentors must be at least age 18 but must be ready and willing to put time into the child. People either meet it or they don't. Mentors come in all different forms. The criterion is: Do you have the time?
O'Reilly said Plunkett's technicians also tell her they appreciate the flexible schedules.
"Kerri is not real loud on the field and with Rachel moving to the mound, she's not able to be as vocal as far as moving players around. It's an adjustment with the leadership role, so Jones is having to step up and do a lot. They're having to come out of their shell a little bit and do a lot more talking than they have in the past."

"If interest rates rise, so does my monthly payment," she said.
Ener1 marks the second major case of the U.S. losing control of a stimulus project. The Department of Energy's $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra to produce solar panels was aimed at spurring alternative energy growth in the U.S. and to lessen dependence on fossil fuels. Instead, competition from China felled Solyndra last year, which left the U.S. to pay the bill.

* Once again, props go to the video production team, as they put together a nice package on Lesnar, who declared himself as an "ass kicker," not a superstar.

She and other like-minded Democratic legislators have run into trouble. Lobbyists for the banking and mortgage industries say that key elements invite lawsuits while other parts are so onerous that new lending will dry up. Push too hard and the loan money needed to revive the state's housing industry will vanish, this side argues.
I was hanging out with my buddies, when this really cute guy started talking to my friend Robbie about the dot-com shirt he was wearing. It was Eric, and he was talking to my friend in the hopes of getting introduced to me.

As car makers have equipped vehicles with air bags, stability-control systems, computer-assisted antiskid brakes and more crashworthy body designs, traffic-safety regulators have shifted their focus to driver behavior—and various ways to control it. Among the risks of trying to minimize the driver's role are that motorists will reject the technology.
We have not always been thanked for these efforts, and we have at times made mistakes.

To get a sense of the ferment, head to the Denver Public Library's Western History & Geneology department, on the fifth floor, and poke around in the microfilm stacks for newspapers.

"We thought we might get it on iTunes and go straight to her scenes and pause it, or just wait for the DVD," says Stacy. "I told Kyra, when she's older, much older, she can have a slumber party with all her friends and watch it and say, 'Look, that's me. I was in a movie.' "
