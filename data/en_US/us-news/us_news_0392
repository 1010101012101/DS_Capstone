"It's been 14-0 on a lot of things," Selig said. "We spend hours talking about it. One year it could hurt, one year it could be helpful."If baseball had the extra playoff team in place this year, the drama of the Cards-Braves for the final NL spot or Red Sox-Rays for the AL would have been lost."We can't let one year influence us," Selig said. "This is for the long term. We can't keep doing the same things. Change is difficult. Baseball is a social institution, very difficult to change. But once you've made it, people are very comfortable with it."Selig said that having a new postseason structure in place by next season "may be a bit optimistic" because it will be a part of the current labor negotiations. "Nothing is cast in stone. We'll see how it all plays out."The commissioner was quick to remind listeners that when baseball added a wild-card team in September 1993 (it didn't become effective until the 1995 season) that people said "I was ruining the sport," but noted, "It's worked out better than anyone could have dreamed."Another issue is the length of the season - Selig doesn't like games in November - but he said those things can be worked out.In a

I guess this storyline will only be successful if Cena actually does turn heel in the process, that is more and more looking unlikely. They are teasing the fans with "Embrace the Hate", but why do it before the biggest match in years?

The bill passed by an 18-11 vote in the Senate, but faces more opposition in the House, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.

Good information does not inexorably lead to good government. "Never underestimate the difficulty of changing false beliefs by facts," the economist Henry Rosovsky once said. People do change their minds, but experience has more effect than argument. World War II convinced most Americans that the isolationism of the previous decades was mistaken. The high inflation of the 1970s (and not essays about inflation's evils) persuaded most people that economic policy had gone disastrously wrong. And so on.

I drove over for a peek at Grove Market. The dining room and kitchen are housed in a squat red bungalow. Directly behind it sits a garden, and back on the left the smokehouse, the source of Grove Market's famed smoked seafood.

I didn't meet anyone who had been there, but many people were proud to have it in their backyard.

Said Kushner, who has worked with Newell on three Court productions (and is quietly planning others with the Chicago director, both originals and adaptations neither will discuss): "I couldn't begin to tell you what makes a regional Tony winner. But I can say the Court is developing a spectacular reputation as one of the most important theaters in the country. And that's tied to Charlie. His interpretations don't compete with the original texts. But you also don't want a director who just listens to your ideas and takes dictation from you. And Charlie doesn't. He asks, he listens, he brings a sensitive response — but he is unflappable."

Get much closer to the water and you'll get wet. With East Harbor to the right, West Harbor to the left and a tiki bar out back, visitors to the Crow's Nest -- many of them boaters -- are living the island life on the mainland. Among the favored libations here: a Lake Erie Sunrise, featuring mango and raspberry puree mixed with Parrot Bay Rum, and, about 14 hours later, a Lake Erie Sunset, made with strawberry and banana flavors.

øThat means Apple's run-up has been breathtaking, for sure. But Apple has been more of the exception than the rule. And while a fall in Apple shares would certainly sting and hurt other tech stocks, it wouldn't be enough to yank the tech sector into a recession. And that would especially be true if other tech companies find a way to compete with Apple. In that case, they might take share and prosper as a result.

øThe vibe: "I would be completely shocked if it would be an all-white sort of wedding." So Lee envisions noir nuptials: black mirrors, 2-foot candlesticks, dark, rich flowers and, juxtaposed against the 14th-century surroundings, sleek, contemporary furniture for lounging. But it wouldn't be all adult lair. Lee sees lots of children "running around the sprawling lawn. It can't be more magnificent than that - sort of heaven on earth." And for a late-night snack? Considering the clan's photographed penchant for junk food, mini bags of McDonald's cheeseburgers, french fries, hot apple pies and shakes flown in.

Here it's more like boy meets girl and neither had a script. (They did have a 50-page outline.) That requires some seriously good improvisational acting on the part of the leads.

The figure comes from an industry-funded study and has been cited by the Ohio Manufacturers Association.

He even lined up a few millionaire donors, mostly Democrat fundraisers, to stand behind him while he made his pitch to the nation for raising taxes.

Mike Acker: The offseason's biggest question mark, the Blazers' biggest question mark, maybe one of the biggest question marks in the NBA. Brandon's season was heartbreaking at times, heartwarming for two games in the playoffs, and ultimately frustrating. Brandon can clearly still play occasionally -- see the fourth quarter of Game 4 -- but he didn't seem capable of playing well for multiple games in a row. Brandon has a lot of pride and competitive spirit, and there's no doubt in my mind that he believes he's got some career left. He stated publicly that he wants to get back into the starting lineup. Nate's going to have to make him earn it, but a motivated Brandon is probably better than a guy that has given up on himself. The Vince Carter/Gilbert Arenas/Rashard Lewis blockbuster midseason trade showed that any contract is moveable given the right circumstances. I'm not saying it's time to part ways with the guy that basically saved this franchise. I just think it might be time for Portland to take a good hard look at how Brandon fits into the picture going forward.

Housing near a train station or along tracks used to be undesirable, as trains rattling by would shake apartments and residents endured the engine's horn and wheels' screech on the tracks.
I have long believed that it won't be illegal immigration, or the treatment of Hispanics in general, that takes down Arpaio. Unfortunately, his brutal posturing on immigration has curried too much favor with the general public.
Was the kid capable of doing it?

Despite her fears, Fournier seemed to feel safe at work.
His Reagan-era trilogy of "Metropolitan," "Barcelona" and "The Last Days of Disco" distilled martini-dry humor from the foibles of the trust-fund set. "Damsels in Distress," Stillman's first film in 14 years, moves his idiosyncratic drawing-room comedy to a dorm room. It's a slight piece of work, but agreeably peculiar and endearing.
But Republican leaders say they are committed to making sure that businesses get the tax breaks they were promised. ``We have a law on the books'' that should be followed, said Senate President Brady Adams, R-Grants Pass.
A 26-yard touchdown pass from No. 1 McKee/Staten Island Tech's T.J. Ferranola to Charles D’Onigbinde was one of the only hiccups for an otherwise solid South Shore defense in a heartbreaking 20-14 loss Sunday in the PSAL Cup championship at Lincoln HS in Brooklyn.
We’d been meeting with the parents, and Grafton and I, we kind of knew early on that the direction we were going was different than them. We didn’t want to be pushed to a resolution. Do I think they did anything wrong intentionally? No. No one wants that many kids to lose their lives. They should have warned her earlier to give her a chance to make a decision. She might have still gone to class. But they didn’t even give her the option. Just because you feel safe, you still have a duty to warn.
"Batman" (1989): Tim Burton took what seemed like a dark look at the Caped Crusader. Given more-recent Batman films, you may remember this as somewhat campy. But it's a lot grittier than you probably recall, and Michael Keaton makes a really good Bruce Wayne, capturing the difficulty of his dual nature. Jack Nicholson's not a bad Joker, either.
"My first thought was, 'What if this turns out to be it, and it's my fault we lost?' " the Legacy senior pitcher said. "Then I thought: 'No, we're not going to do that. Everybody get a hit.' "

"This has to be one of the weakest attempts at cutting property taxes in the Northern Hemisphere," Summers said. "This is her attempt at providing the least amount of tax relief possible, and it assumes revenue from a dubious funding source. It gives her a very easy way out. I'm willing to bet that slots revenue won't materialize and this plan won't go through."
More than 1,000 members of evangelical churches from across metro Detroit packed Woodward Avenue today to participate in the second annual prayer walk aimed at helping the city of Detroit.
The creation of such schools isn't a painless choice. It means that other schools have a higher concentration of students with disciplinary problems, and less-involved families. Foster children especially have little shot at schools that require an active parental role. This doesn't let the district off the hook for improving outcomes for all students — and in Santa Ana, the regular public schools have been improving steadily and borrowing ideas from the fundamental schools. But L.A. Unified should encourage ambition and excellence wherever it can; motivated families are rightly unwilling to wait years or decades for chaotic neighborhood schools to improve.
I liked that I could only listen to my albums on a turntable in the living room. I liked yearning for my favorite records. I can still remember spending the entire day at school counting the minutes until I could get home to listen to the transcendent power chords of Styx's "Paradise Theater."

Aaron Craft and Shia Labeouf -- Anthony Muni
Last week, special-teamer Kenny Onatolu's late hit on a punt return gave the Vikings the ball at their 40-yard line with 11 seconds left and no timeouts in a tie game.

"Early in the game, we were just too content to settle for the outside shot," said Central coach Stan Eagleson, whose team finished fourth in the state last season. "Too many shots from the perimeter and not enough inside to Book. Then when we did get to the free throw line, we just didn't make enough free throws."
"It's great," said 29-year-old government worker Ellen Bengtsson. "We'll go back sweaty together."
Then there was the game itself. Our parking space was so far away I had to hold up and push my Dad (who was having pretty bad knee troubles) for the long walk. But once we arrived, even from our nosebleed seats, the game was everything we expected and more. One thing was for sure - we learned that events such as this one can bond an entire city as well as a father and son.

I find it interesting that such a well-armored, leave-me-alone plant has such pretty, delicate blossoms. The white nearly flat cup-shaped blooms are 2 to 3 inches wide with bright yellow centers. They are easy to notice when driving down the road because they provide a sharp contrast to the green landscape.

WASHINGTON - Almost four years after America's financial near-collapse, regulators are empowered to police financial markets as never before. Yet some of the most important rules to curb Wall Street's bad behavior have yet to take effect -- and could be watered down.
The "California Report on Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery, 2009 Hospital Data," by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, reviewed the 119 hospitals in the state that do the surgery.

If she wants to sell the city's historic properties to help fund the budget, she should be asking the governor why he didn't make needed repairs while mayor. She might ask for state aid but since the General Assembly recently passed a "doomsday budget," there probably isn't any money.
Woolbright sought to avoid being served the court order and initially continued to hear cases involving such orders. The commission's attorney also pointed to numerous other issues including a pattern of dishonesty, Woolbright's attempts to abuse his position as a judge by invoking it repeatedly as unsolicited information to law-enforcement authorities and sending threatening texts to his then-wife.
If approved by a judge, the settlement will end a well-publicized tussle that began with five record companies accusing Patricia Santangelo, a mother of five, of illegally downloading and distributing music.
Tax hikes are never easy sells. Reviews on Berggruen's proposal are mixed at best. He proposes to raise money for the state. Voters are more likely to favor tax hikes if the money will be spent locally. Munger is counting on this.

"Frosty the Snowman" is a favorite. Happily for O'Brien, "Nancy Pelosi" has the same number of syllables as the star of the song ("Nancy Pelosi had a heady power surge. But she overstepped in a way inept and it turned into a purge.")
New research shows that only one-quarter of America's 52 million K-12 students perform on par with the average performance of the world's five best school systems -- which are now in Singapore, Hong Kong, Finland, Taiwan and South Korea. Even worse is U.S. performance in advanced achievement in math and science, the best predictor of the engineering and scientific prowess that will drive future growth. Sixteen countries produce at least twice the percentage of advanced math students we do, according to research from Harvard and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The United States spends more on schools than most wealthy nations as a share of GDP yet ranks in the middle to the bottom of the pack on international comparisons. McKinsey estimates that the cost of this achievement gap vs. other nations is up to $2 trillion a year -- the equivalent of a permanent national recession.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - In nearly four months in Happy Valley, Penn State coach Bill O'Brien has delivered speeches, overseen pre-dawn conditioning drills and started installing a new high-octane offense.
For people with serious allergies to bee stings, peanuts or other compounds, there's something even scarier than insects, PB&J, or whatever your nemesis is. It's that should you need an EpiPen -- a ready-made shot of epinephrine you can give to yourself to stop a life-threatening allergic reaction -- and you probably don't know how to use it. And your doctor might not either.
The fun part is that we decided to pass off the treasure at a Mexican restaurant. We are not picky in our ethnic cuisine.

Like the millions of women who have opted for hormone replacement therapy, men are choosing to get their hormone levels in line. As many as 13.8 million men older than 45 in the U.S. have low levels of testosterone, according to a 2006 study in the International Journal of Clinical Practice.
In the second half as Fussell's cool demeanor permeated the Tigers, they began to knock the ball around and take their time. She helped change the complexion of the game about midway through the second half when she broke in on the left side and won the end line. She went hard at the goalkeeper who came off her line. Fussell floated a beauty of a ball high and towards the goalmouth. Junior Emily Pedroli was there to chest it down and into the wide open net. Had she not been there, sophomore striker Nicole Mard was there too.

The currents aren’t perfect. Once, Wojciehowski was using the electrodes to stimulate his left wrist, but his right shoulder started to twitch. They both still laugh at that.
Sports fans, understandably, tend to react to this stuff with a simple unspoken question: How does this affect me? It's human nature. If your spouse cheats on you, you're mad; if you're cousin's wife cheats on him, you're not quite as mad; if some celebrity's wife cheats on him, you are entertained.

Top officials at the state Department of Human Services have known for at least two years of smuggling attempts at the facility. But it was not until last month, following the drug overdoses and a patient being put on life support, that they ordered a top-to-bottom security and licensing review.
The 1DollarScan process is simple, but don't be fooled by the $1 inference. The company charges $1 to convert increments of 100 pages, and if you want your e-book to be searchable, the price doubles. Ergo, a 500-page book like the Scribner's edition of "For Whom the Bell Tolls" would cost $10 to convert. That's almost as much as the cost of the Kindle version of the same book from Amazon.com.
The No. 6 Oregon Ducks take on the No. 3 Stanford Cardinal (5:00 p.m. PT, ABC) in the biggest Pac-12 game to date. The winner of this game will become the favorite to win the Pac-12 title, and perhaps earn a berth into the BCS National Championship game.

Proponents of the measure also defend it as an attempt -- in line with those going back to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 -- to protect the minority from majority tyranny. If that seems a suspicious claim, it ought to. Given the way the federal system works, the amendment would amount -- much as the Senate filibuster does -- to giving a minority of Americans another means of preventing the majority from governing.
Student loans seem especially troublesome, because the young adults taking them have the least experience with budgeting and handling debt. They may be highly susceptible to the idea of deferred payments until graduation and to marketing pitches, often from lenders that operate outside the federally supported system and can charge even more than the rate Congress sets.

The backlash was intense, many wondering why she'd share such a scene with the world — although Bear Blu, her son, appears pretty happy in the clip.
“Hopefully what we are doing inspires other athletes. But it’s not just for athletes,” Rasheed said. “We have a history here of people past a certain age graduating from Cumberland. I hope it encourages other people to come back and I would like that also. I wouldn’t mind being the motivation being someone that can help others.”
Portland isn't just going to stand pat and see what happens in the playoffs. It's rolled the dice, a little. It's going to have fun, getting up and down, with the not-so-fun-to-play-against Wallace running the wing. And the Blazers managed to leave Thursday with both Andre Miller and Marcus Camby still on the court, and available to be traded in the next year.

“At least for me, Christianity is an important piece of it,” says Grom, 25, “and I know that’s true for a lot of the people who initially came on board.

We just hope to put on a first-rate festival, and open our doors to everyone who wants to enjoy the fruits of belief.”
At lunch, the most Italian pizzas in town issue from the oven at Angelini Osteria. Last week I had a flawless pizza, or rather two -- a thin, crisp crust blistered from the oven and topped with mushrooms and slices of rosy prosciutto. Sometimes he'll do a wonderful burrata pizza as a special with fresh cherry tomatoes and that creamy fresh cheese, it's as good as it gets. And since Angelini is a full-service trattoria, you can also get bowls of pasta e fagioli, his irresistible penne all' Amatriciana made with house-cured guanciale and for dessert, an affogato (vanilla ice cream drowned in a cup of espresso).

During a recent appearance on WTTW's public affairs show "Chicago Tonight," Kantor told host Phil Ponce, "I really wrote this book to answer the questions that I thought voters, and especially Chicagoans, would have going into the 2012 race. How do two pretty normal people turn themselves into president and first lady? How does a marriage become a kind of political partnership in the White House, what is the behind-the-scenes of their adjustment to White House life? Why don't they come back more often? Do they still love us?"

"The market may be recognizing that the quick fixes may not have worked very well," she said. "They didn't create any opportunities for employment growth. They didn't do anything for housing. They didn't do anything for the real problems, and they've been costly. If there is a double-dip recession, and there is going to be a quick fix, will that be good enough? Or do we even want that, because it hasn't done anything?"

It is too early to know for certain just how widespread the problems were, but it is a credible allegation that some district workers cheated, or helped students cheat. That is plain wrong, and tantamount to robbing students of their right to earn a decent education.
No matter how you get to the top, your motives have to be right. If your motives are not right and you don't remember why you're striving to get there, the results can be dangerous.

Meanwhile, as Saturday matinee after Saturday matinee came and passed, alongside the cinema, the small store of Mr. Bilder seemed to recede further and further into the shadows.

BATHROOM: Rather roomy, done up in marble earth tones complementing the room.

A: The Connecticut State Medical Society contends that more research is needed to adequately determine how well medical marijuana works. It also cites concerns about quality control and standardization, as well as contamination with pesticides and microbes, and argues that patients cannot be assured a reliable and reproducible dose. U.S. Attorney David Fein says the state law would authorize conduct contrary to federal law and undermine the federal government's efforts to regulate the possession, manufacture and trafficking of controlled substances. Fein said that the U.S. Department of Justice would not focus on seriously ill individuals who use marijuana, but that it would pursue growing facilities and dispensaries that would be violating federal law. The legislation's opponents also say that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that legalizing its use would send the wrong message to young people.

Maria Menounos danced a high-energy salsa with hot pro partner Derek Hough, but not before we saw her slam into the floor when he dropped her during rehearsals. "My chin!" she said, crying. Turned out it was fine. The chin injury, added to her rib and feet problems, prompted her to put on a body covering of bubble-wrap to rehearse. Don't worry, though, for the dance she had a sparkly skirt and bikini bra top to show off her taut tummy and sexy moves. Halfway through, Derek took off his shirt and Maria planted a kiss on his lips to up the sexy ante. Did it pay off? The audience loved it. And the judges? Carrie Ann said she was "fantastic." But, she said, "I don't think you needed the kiss! The salsa is all about the illusion of passion. Don't go at it right in front of us!" Len said, "Two things were revealed out there - Derek's body and your talent." He added that the "talent was fantastic." Bruno licked his lips and asked, "Was it legal? Want me to get you a room? May I join in?" Scores: 9, 9, 9 = 27

Given his injury history, the news about Chris Carpenter is disturbing. Carpenter turns 37 on April 27.

This edge, this need for victory — what Nathaniel Rich, in his essay "The Queens Speech," calls "Win At All Costs (WAAC)" — is one of the central subtexts in "Damn Yankees: Twenty-Four Major-League Writers on the World's Most Loved (and Hated) Team," edited by former Sports Illustrated executive editor Rob Fleder. What gives the book its resonance, however, is how the best work here tends to turn that on its ear, exposing it as the most obvious and least interesting filter for coming to terms with the team.
I've fished with a lot of walleye pros, and you'd be amazed how finicky most of them are about getting the boat speed just right. Most of them carry a drift sock, a big cloth bag open at both ends that hangs off a cleat at the side of the boat.

The second condition may also cause occasional gagging noises.

In an opinion published in the New York Times in 2009, Ullman embraced these "mysterious origins" and wanted "to give not knowing its due." A sense of "not knowing" suffuses the language of "By Blood," with its nameless characters, strange phenomena - the numbers on office doors, for one, come inexplicably, suddenly, to life - and the sense of stasis that comes with a fragmented identity.
Pagan community call a "Plastic shaman." That is, someone who appropriates another culture's traditions without diligent study and proper training.

The last time I saw Cassell play was at the Bmorehoops.com All-Star Game at The Dome in East Baltimore last August. The 2012 game was the quintessential all-star event in the sense that defense was nowhere to be found and probably 60 percent of the field-goal attempts were dunks. But Cassell stood out by making seven or eight 3s of the ridiculous, step-back variety. They were the types of triples where you think, "Wow, that shot has no chance of going in" or simply, "What is he doing?" And then the 3 would fall and everyone would go crazy. Cassell did the same thing with Nike Baltimore Elite last summer and with Notre Dame Prep over the fall and winter. At some point, you have to acknowledge that there's nothing at all fluky about his game. Cassell's style may look a bit unorthodox, but he has proven over and over again that he's an elite outside shooter. The ACC is certainly a different animal, but doing it on the Nike EYBL circuit and in the New England Preparatory Schools Athletic Conference -- the highest levels of AAU and prep school -- cannot be discounted.
Gebauer, then 79 and an unlicensed dentist, had just fatally shot a man, and prosecutors suggested that the prayers reflected his remorse.
As at Coi, vegetables are in the forefront of most dishes, such as a chilled eggplant soup ($9) and braised cauliflower with dandelion salsa verde ($12). Still, there are a few rich and meaty options, including a pork trotter burger ($12) and a modern take on lamb stew ($19).

Signed to a five-year, $85 million contract extension last August, the 29-year-old right-hander pitched his first no-hitter Wednesday night, dominating lowly Minnesota in a 9-0 cakewalk. All the Twins could muster against the two-time All-Star was one walk—and one other baserunner when catcher Chris Iannetta allowed a passed ball on a swinging third strike.

A total of 36 municipalities governed by the Faulkner Act are holding elections in May and out of the $11.4 million raised throughout the state, Newark candidates have raised $9.2 million.

“Movies like this live and die on whether or not characters care about one another. In all the great cop movies, you have to feel each partner wants the best for the other one. Our friendship in this film is tested and then put back together, so you’ve gotta kind of want them to make it through to the other side. I think that exists because we really get along well in real life and . . . well, you know, we’re good actors (laughs).

The centerpiece set-piece of Ghost Protocol involves a complicated swap of launch codes for diamonds, a fetching French assassin (Léa Seydoux), a Russian arms dealer (Samuli Edelmann), and tricky parallel meetings on adjoining floors of Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. For reasons too absurd to get into (or to understand), Hunt is required to scale multiple stories of the vertiginous glass skyscraper - clambering up the building's reflective skin using high-tech suction-cup gloves and a look of grim determination. It's an amazing sequence - suspenseful, cinematic, outlandish, hard to top. Which makes Bird's mission for what follows - the chase through the sandstorm, the vertical parking-lot game of musical cars, the fancy hotel seduction scene involving the beautiful Paula Patton and a Mumbai playboy billionaire - rather daunting. Inevitably, the pace, and purpose, flag.

"Speaker Pelosi lost round one in the message war," agrees GOP strategist Patrick Dorinson. "She misread the election results. They were overwhelming for Barack Obama, but Congress is still languishing with a 27 percent approval rating." He said that Pelosi appeared to take Obama's approval as a signal her party could "make a grab bag of Democratic wish lists" and add them to the package, he said. "Republicans rightly pointed out the hypocrisy."

Now, his family and police are asking for the public's help in finding the suspect responsible.
Nicks is in a much better position to contribute now because he's gotten acclimated to the offense. A hamstring injury that sidelined him for a handful of days early in training camp slowed his development and he admitted he felt "slow" in the first two preseason games. By that, he didn't mean the hamstring hampered his running ability, but rather that his limited grasp of the offense made everything around him seem to be moving more quickly.

At times, hiking through the park seemed like a lunar experience. The Notch Trail cuts through a canyon surrounded by colorless towering rocks leading to an open area seemingly devoid of life. To reach the trail's namesake "notch" above a cliff overlooking the White River Valley, hikers have a rare and slightly daunting opportunity to scale a steep log ladder leading to a ledge where the trail continues. While exploring the area, I quickly noticed that little pieces of rock could be chipped away easily with a fingernail. That serves as a warning that you can't fully trust your surroundings, especially when teetering on a cliff.
I mean, where have you gone, Paul Sunday? (Warning: The crazy "There Will Be Blood" spoilers start here.) Paul, the character who sets the story in motion, who tells Plainview about the oil in Little Boston, is a mystery to us. Not only do we never see him again, but we barely hear his name until Plainview calls him "chosen" and "the prophet" in the movie's final moments to Paul's twin, Eli -- words that hit Eli nearly as hard as the blows from Plainview that end his life.

Point: Colorado Latinos are classic swing voters. The lack of action on comprehensive immigration reform and on the DREAM Act hurts Obama. So does the record level of deportations — though that has some Latinos cheering. Becerra says what you might expect: The president remains committed to immigration reform but has been stonewalled by a hostile Congress. And the deportations? "The president ran for office swearing to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States." But the congressman adds, Obama has some discretion in enforcement of immigration law, in setting priorities. "When was the last time a DREAM Act kid you know of was deported?"

Less successful was the sultani kebab, at $15.95 one of the pricier items on a value-priced menu. The dish paired a char-broiled steak strip and a skewer of kafta kebab, a blend of ground beef and lamb, over fragrant rice.

The meeting with the bank was 25 days away. That meant 25 days to announce the plan to staff, who would have to work four 10-hour shifts and give up their weekends.

Yes, our government aided and abetted the housing market meltdown. But it did so by promoting its view of the best of what the free market could do. In many ways, the era of 2001-06 was intended to be the dress rehearsal for a pageant demonstrating that we no longer needed government involvements like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration or a regulated bank mortgage market system; the unregulated mortgage broker-Wall Street axis would do just fine, thank you. Unfortunately, we are all stuck with watching the pageant having turned into a colossal flop.

For the past three months, Taylor became the face of what was possible for the Jayhawks. It didn’t matter who didn’t believe. They did. So when Taylor changed, so did his team. Gone was the immature player who injured a finger in an on-campus fight two years ago with KU football players, the knucklehead who was suspended for two exhibition games to start this season, the self-conscious youngster who in January lashed out on Twitter at critics.

In the currency markets, some analysts suggest the euro's resilience reflects an absence of capital being pulled out of Europe by global investors, which would depress the value of the currency.

The administration’s idea now is to analyze the feasibility of switching to a fully automated refuse and recycling pickup program.

"Somebody agrees to come to Cleveland, and we shower them with attention and affection. ... If you look at it in terms of scale and size, you might think we can't compete. But for events like this, I think they want to see the community embrace the event and really fit it into the community, in a way that a city that holds uncounted numbers of conventions each year cannot.
