The question of turnout should be crucial in this discussion because none of the other reasons proffered for switching to the presidential cycle is a worthy basis for public policy.

Instead, it has led to apathy.

Witty and hard-living (vodka after her morning coffee, Jack Daniels in the evening), Mitford was somehow everywhere: House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, the Rosenbergs' trial, following the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Ala., Black Panther benefits. But unlike Zelig, she was no wallflower.

Both Roussef and Serra are left-of-center candidates. Lula may be trying to make sure that his candidate is not outflanked on the left, and could be preparing the ground to cast Serra -- who has criticized Lula's embrace of Ahmadinejad -- as a candidate with weak "progressive" credentials.
"They are fearful of what may happen to them if they were to snitch on these coyote people," Wiley said of the recruiters and smugglers who bring marijuana farmers into the U.S. "That's organized crime of a different fashion. There's nothing to gain from (talking), but there's a lot to lose."

On Sept. 18, peak tolls rose to $9.50 for E-ZPass users and $12 for cash customers on its six bistate bridges and tunnels, from $8. Tolls are to rise to $12.50 and $15 for E-ZPass and cash users respectively, as of December 2015. The agency says the toll hike is necessary to help pay for a $25 billion capital plan, including redevelopment of the World Trade Center site, in the face of recession-related revenue declines. On Tuesday, The New York and North Jersey chapters of AAA filed a federal lawsuit to block the toll hike, charging that it violates federal law by using toll money to pay for non-transporation related projects.

Asked what he learned from his first NFL draft as a team's personnel chief in 2011, Broncos executive vice president of football operations John Elway used the word "fluid." Fluid, as in ever-changing and always unpredictable. One day out, things are fluid all over the league, except at the top, where the top two quarterbacks will be taken on Thursday night. Beyond that, phones are ringing all over the NFL and the deals are percolating. Denver Post draft insider Jeff Legwold analyzes the first-round wants and needs of each team with a pick.
Buttler remembers Yvette as a sweet but troubled teenager. But as her guardian, Buttler was unable to get any financial help from the state unless she agreed to become a licensed foster parent.

Brides and bridal gowns have always offered a measure of our longings and aspirations. Just 51% of American adults are now married—a record low—according to a report issued last month by the Pew Research Center. Pew also reports that 39% of Americans believe marriage is "becoming obsolete." And yet, in the story of this old bridal shop in a rural, one-stoplight town, it's easy to see why, despite everything, wedding gowns remain a symbol of hope.

--LF Coco Crisp was back in the lineup Wednesday after missing the previous night's game with a sinus infection, a decision manager Bob Melvin made because of the cold, damp weather in Boston. With 2B Jemile Weeks out because of slight groin tightness, Crisp hit leadoff. He left the game in the eighth inning, however, with more inner-ear trouble, and it's possible the team will consider a disabled-list stay. Crisp has been dealing with sinus and inner-ear issues for two weeks.

* Don't look now, but the Blues have lost four consecutive home games. (Obviously, the streak started late in the regular season.) And in the four losses (one in a shootout) the Blues have scored only seven goals. This is disturbing for obvious reasons. The Blues dominated visitors at Scottrade Center this season, amassing the best home-ice winning percentage in franchise history. Needless to say, unless the Blues can quickly reestablish home-ice superiority, this will be a very short stay in the playoffs.
With Mitt Romney all but officially anointed the Republican presidential nominee, the national political narrative now turns to the "Veepstakes": who Romney will choose for his running mate.

How important a task is writing about this? As a writer, I see the glaring consequences of our failure to demand reality every day — how we have allowed commercial mythologies to dominate the perception of the city. I see it in the way people receive literature from Los Angeles. Tell people Susan Sontag was from here and you'll see what I mean. It's true in all the arts, and perhaps in other fields as well. It's harder for our writers to be reviewed seriously. L.A. writers still must navigate the entrenched notion that we're all out here lying by the pool with a margarita in one hand and a phone in the other.

On the positive side, Huntsman leaves the race with higher name ID, at least among voters who were paying close attention to his candidacy. He didn’t particularly impress fellow Republican politicians but now has a better idea of what it takes to be a successful national candidate (more than running a one-state campaign, for starters). In his remarks Monday, Huntsman alluded to the education he got over the last seven months, when he said he was stepping down “with an even greater appreciation for American democracy.”
He suspects Democrats are behind the flier, trying to move conservative voters into his camp from the Republican Carle, but he has no proof.

More unusual is for a prominent multistarred chef to leave his own country and stake everything on a new venture elsewhere, which is what Italian chef Bruno Barbieri has done with Cotidie on Marylebone High Street in central London. "We want to be something like a small window for niche producers who want to have a presence out of Italy," the 50-year-old chef says.

When I was on the plane coming over, it was like "Oh my God what have I done?" You are always a bit nervous until you go to the workshop and see what they've been doing.

The argument between Messrs. Leopold and Maxwell goes back a year to the introduction of the executive's budget for fiscal 2012. Mr. Leopold, like many local leaders, was feeling the pinch of the recession, with the added pressure of Anne Arundel's strict voter-approved property tax cap. In March of 2011, he applied to the state for a waiver from maintenance of effort, arguing that the county should not have to meet the requirement to provide the same per pupil funding as the year before because it had exceeded that standard in the past. A decade before, schools had taken up 42 percent of the county budget, he said, but by then, they were up to 52 percent, squeezing out other essential county functions. The system, he said, needed to be reset.

Russ Granik, former deputy commissioner of the National Basketball Association, said the severity of the penalties didn't surprise him.

His playing often sounded effortless, with rapidly moving lines taking off with a natural quality.

And the administration has suffered repeatedly from complacency - taking a few months of good news as an excuse to rest on its laurels rather than hammering home the need for more action. It did that in 2010, it did it in 2011, and to a certain extent it has been doing the same thing this year too. So there is a valid critique one can make of the administration's handling of the economy.

It's the sort of quiet, restrained set that you don't realize you love until it seeps into your dreams -- and after that, it keeps coming back to a listener, again and again, casting its peculiar, warm light on the day-to-day.

Her voice, too, is an unusual and original one: She's got hints of Sam Phillips and Aimee Mann, but she sounds more knowing than either one.

New York’s depth. D.C.’s Olsen acknowledged that excitement over United’s 4-1 win should be tempered by the fact that New York “came here with a little bit of a watered-down team.” But from a Red Bulls perspective, the stunning capitulation at RFK should be cause for concern.

One of my very first editorials for this newspaper offered a glowing appraisal for a ballot measure (Proposition B, March 1996) to waive the height limits and parking restrictions that stood in the way of a waterfront ballpark.

One reader wrote, paraphrasing here, Herb added to the quality of the landscape and atmosphere while listening to him in a fishing boat on a peaceful lake somewhere in Minnesota on any given Sunday afternoon (or ANY afternoon or night). That reader captured it. Herb WAS comforting and the sort of broadcaster rarely heard these days. He had dignity and grace, and most of all, for me, made everything he described sound important, but without trumpeting.

Lamott never seems reticent to admit her own struggles with alcohol and drugs. Sober now for two-and-a-half decades, she still has to work at it, and humor is one of her great tools. But so is faith. A kind of leftist radical born-again Christian, Lamott shares her faith in such a matter-of-fact way that really, I want to kiss her for it. She shows us how she lives in community, how she works at building and keeping the support of her tribal circle of friends, family, priests, advisers and church brethren. She freely expresses her innermost feelings but consciously reveals more about herself than those nearest and dearest, removing, carefully but publicly, the log in her own eye. If she makes critical, complaining remarks about someone -- for example the mother of her grandson -- she turns it back on herself.
Multiple restaurants and night clubs on the property at the corner of Routes 1 and 152 have run afoul of the liquor control board, which ending up revoking the liquor licenses of at least two of The Mallet's predecessors, most recently Tully's of Fallston, whose license was revoked after a stabbing over Halloween weekend in 2009.

I am really proud of this song. Particularly I like certain elements that I included from the text. "A chalice in your hand of poison sold" refers to when Juliet sees Romeo poisoned himself and he actually was holding a chalice. "I kiss your poisoned lips and shed a tear. You didn't leave for me a drop so dear," this also is directly from the text. Juliet kisses Romeo on the lips to see if there was any poison left for her. So I like the small attention to detail.

"That's always been a positive on the road — there's a strength between the three of us, and Alan as well. ... It's a very positive thing. The negative thing is, when we leave town, with kids, all the aunties and uncles are gone."

But for the rest of Santorum's role in this campaign? We've got not much more than a simple buh-bye -- to his extremist politics, to his dangerous confusion of messianic religious fervor with sound public policy, to his tugging of the overall race toward those extremist politics, even to his sweater vest.
If Ohio's population was 42,753 higher than estimated in 2009 - an increase of just 0.4% - and nothing changed elsewhere, Ohio would grab that final seat from Washington, giving the state 17 seats when the next Congress is elected in 2012.

"This is such an unusual situation that it appears the impulsivity was out of her conscious control," said Glick, whose nonprofit works with Indiana youths who have been in the juvenile justice system.

My closet is a disaster. I often think, "I have nothing to wear!" Usually I just throw on whatever comfortable clothes I find or wear the same few workable outfits each season. Easily pulling myself together is not my prime skill set. How amazing to have confidence and style at my fingertips!
I never had an issue with the BCS. Though theoretically flawed, it nonetheless succeeded in turning what inherently remains a regional passion into a national obsession. It worked. It did a much better job of putting together the most deserving teams on the championship stage than any other major sport. It protected the sanctity of the entire regular season -- not just the closing weeks as is generally the case with Major League Baseball, the NFL and the NHL.
After all, last year's bullpen blew 25 saves. Some were in the same game and some in games the Blue Jays won. But they were only 33-for-58 in save opportunities.

It's always tough to say exactly how much oil and gas lies under the ocean. But if drillers are able to tap as much as the government estimates in the areas to be opened for exploration, they could pump enough to cover a 15-year supply of oil and a 22-year supply of natural gas for the nation.

Perhaps most importantly, he was available. After lessons in osmosis and dissection - and reminding his students about how much money their parents were spending on their education - his classroom was open to any kid who wanted to jawbone about the Bears or shadowbox with a guy who always seemed faster than them - even though he'd fought in front of crowds of 15,000 decades before they were even born.

The players and owners are busy whining about an unfair deal. But what about fans who are overpaying for tickets, parking, and concessions?

“Simply Marvel,” from Van Berkel, exceedingly messy on Friday, was more under control the second night. Set to spacey piano music by Theo Verby that gave way to Paganini’s string renderings, “Simply Marvel” enjoyed a design environment of crisp, white curlicue hanging sculptures by Dietmar Janeck. The mostly balletic vocabulary underengaged its performers, the men in soft ballet slippers, the ladies on pointe.
There were few eco-opportunities that escaped the team's scrutiny. To cut down on dishes (and more importantly, dish-washing) chicken salad was passed on single-serving spoons, asparagus soup was served in small vintage cordial glasses and strips of organic beef were passed around on potato chips. The guests balanced their cherry lamb burgers on their laps while passionately parsing the merits of Mayor Daley's environmental initiatives. Salisbury perched on a sofa and happily surveyed the scene. "It felt like a wedding reception," she says." There were so many people I wanted to spend time with, but the evening went by in a second."
On Saturday, there are no games in Newark but there are at other Sweet 16 locations across the country, so event planners are organizing viewing parties in the Ironbound similar to what occurred during last summer’s World Cup, so fans can watch the teams vying to be matched up against Newark’s winning team.

I marvel at what he created from what I saw torn down. The bowl is a reminder that beauty isn't always perfection, a memento of my deeply rotten tree, a hint that, in the garden especially, magic awaits, unformed, inside.

For decades, Statehouse officeholders have talked "thrift" but passed "spend." Now, though, Kasich is talking "thrift" about the now-being-drafted 2011-13 budget -- and he may well propose "thrift." If he does, he won't be playing the usual Columbus game.

Going forward, Stoelinga and his co-authors expect global warming to hit the Pacific Northwest more slowly, based on small temperature changes they saw offshore.
This is a place where companies come out of nowhere, rock the world and then disappear again. Same with people. Tramiel, who died at 84 at Stanford Hospital on Sunday, was a Silicon Valley A-lister in the early personal computing days. His Commodore computers -- in addition to the 64 there was the VIC-20 and the PET -- helped open a new digital world to enthusiasts beyond the hobbyists who could build their own machines. The 64, which ranks as one of the best-selling personal computer models ever, still induces nostalgic rhapsody in its legion of onetime owners.

Don't fall for the "100 percent durum wheat" label. It doesn't mean anything if it's not 100 percent whole durum wheat. Otherwise, many of whole grain's vital nutrients have been refined away during processing -- and even if some nutrients have been put back by "enriching" the flour, lots are still AWOL. Most noodles, for example, are semi-empty carbs, because they're made with a mix of whole durum and refined semolina flour. Unless pasta's made from 100 percent whole grains, regularly eating bowls of angel hair or penne will raise your blood sugar repeatedly to the point that it damages your heart's blood vessels.

The many doors opening to second-floor roofs show just how many porches have lost their railings. Among them are many in Plat 2, where curvaceous spindles once graced porches and balconies, especially those designed by Ellicott and Emmert. One entire house designed by them at 106 Ridgewood, was demolished in the 1930’s. Another nearby home years ago eliminated its second-floor and first-floor porch.

"We were focused on preventable events, things that can be addressed through safety outreach, engineering, enforcement, enactment of stronger laws, and suicide events didn't figure into that population.
