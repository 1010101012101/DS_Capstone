However, for Ga. 400 toll payers who once expected the toll to expire this year, the congestion relief will be bittersweet. As they now continue paying the toll for another decade to fund the interchange project and others, there is a new kicker. The bid the state accepted Friday for the project is far lower than the state estimated it would be when it made the case that the toll had to be extended.
The money he intends to "invest" isn't his own. It isn't even ours. It's money that Americans -- some of them not yet born -- will have to earn and pay in taxes 30 or 40 years from now to service a debt that the International Monetary Fund has predicted will outstrip the gross domestic product next year.

6. Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz): "Kick-Ass" - Undoubtedly the most lethal and foulmouthed entry on the list, Hit-Girl finds herself in the middle though thanks mostly to her limited screen time and the fact that she's only 10 years old. From the bloody "real-life" comic-book movie "Kick-Ass," Hit-Girl stood out for her effectiveness with a samurai sword and only being moderately warped by being raised by Nicolas Cage.

In debates over how to make sure that children in unaccredited school districts in St. Louis and Kansas City get access to better schools, the same old arguments were tossed back and forth from partisans who have been engaged in this fight for decades. Missouri became a pawn in a national political debate. Republicans pushed vouchers, though they are now redesigned as tax credits. Democrats railed against the failure of charter schools, even as St. Louis school leaders were proposing some of their own.

Like McKinley, Felz said Sellers' retirement would help the city move forward.
Second, House Republicans will pursue a broad offensive against Obama's health care reform. Given the election outcome and public polling on the issue, Republicans are feeling no fear or hesitance. The House will vote for repeal -- which, once again, will go nowhere with the Senate or the president. So Republicans will try to block funding for the implementation of health care reform. And they are planning a series of high-profile oversight hearings to highlight the current and likely effects of Obamacare: premium increases, new burdens on state budgets and a higher-than-expected "dumping rate" as employers push their workers into the public health system. The objective here is to make the case for eventual repeal before most of the public subsidies go into effect in 2014, which would entrench the system.

Sure, the Seahawks - who upset the New Orleans Saints 41-36 on Saturday - won earlier in the season at Soldier Field, but that's going to work against them in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs Sunday.

Showalter doesn't understand the label — or the importance — placed on naming an Opening Day starter. That person is only guaranteed to pitch in that slot once, and the success of the Orioles' pitching rebuilding project will be dictated not by the development of one pitcher, but the entire rotation.

Asked how serious Youkilis situation is, manager Bobby Valentine said, "I was with him today in the training room and there are times where it's pretty sore.

Oakland manager Bob Melvin on Cespedes, the Cuban import in his first year in the United States: "You can literally see him learning on the fly, processing each and every pitch that's thrown to him.

"Ever seen so many changes on the local TV landscape?" said Tim Taylor, a primary anchor at Channel 8 from 1978 until his retirement in December 2005. "In a word, never.

What changed? The sitcom changed, that's what. The networks never really gave up on their 30-minute chucklefests, not out of the goodness of their hearts but because one hit sitcom will make more money than Jersey Shore ever could, with revenue from selling and airing the reruns over and over.
Another former commissioner and USC product, W. Jerome Stanley, echoed those sentiments, although for different reasons.

Emergency and medical calls are much higher at senior rentals, compared with residences overall. Burnsville's 517 assisted-living apartments had 360 calls for service in 2011. That's 0.72 calls per unit, compared with the city's overall rate of 0.06 calls per residence.
When he walked into the practice facility for the first time after his release, he roamed into a familiar locker room and realized he no longer had a locker.

With the ball and the momentum, the Saints had two point-blank shots saved by Doyle and when Glaser scored his fourth goal of the game — collecting a feed from Frederick in transition — the Eagles reclaimed an 11-10 lead with 2:54 to play. But the Saints weren't through, getting a goal from Lewnes with 1:48 to play that forced overtime when Frederick provided the final answer.
Call it the Politics of Hunger. In other words, when you (or your ideological leaders) haven't been invited to dinner at the White House for eight long years, you tend to get motivated. So just as two Clinton-Gore terms energized Republican voters in the 2000 election, and 12 years of Reagan-Bush mobilized Democrats in 1992, there's no question that the majority of grass-roots enthusiasm in this campaign has been on behalf of Obama.

“I love the format, the format's awesome,” White said. “As far as the show goes, it's a home run for FX. It's on Friday nights. Friday nights they do movies and reruns.

The USGA defines golf's core player as one who averages a score of 94, or more than 20 strokes over par. Only 7 percent of golfers average a score under 80, only one percent are scratch players. The average time for an 18-hole round of golf is longer than the time it takes to attend major league baseball games. A round that ends in 4-4½ hours is considered brisk.
It was a reference to outside groups linked to Karl Rove, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, and the heads of Koch Industries, longtime supporters of conservative causes.

A week after the December filming, the producer called back and told Koehler the truth.
After just a few sessions of ECT, the researchers began to see the patterns of hyperconnectivity reduced and, in particular, saw that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was not in constant communication with far-flung regions of the brain. And as evidence of crosstalk in the brain declined, subjects were likely to report greater relief of their depressive symptoms.
From this, I evolved a rule of thumb for touring Europe: Use a train for short hops, a plane for longer trips (except between cities directly linked by high-speed rail) and a car to roam the countryside. The formula varies by your destination and budget, of course.

Quarterback Terrelle Pryor said Tressel has focused on the players being both ticked off about that loss and invested in playing for the pride of Ohio State.

A look at the results against their only common opponent tells the difference — Century beat No. 7 Notre Dame Prep, 9-4, while the Eagles won 19-7.

I did not realize this at the time, but only in hindsight understood that this unkind life's wound set him apart from all of our traditional nuclear families and set up ridicule and fear within our class. We immediately began to tease him a lot, and called out, "Vans!" quickly if he happened to brush against us or if we were to touch him. "Vans!" to redeem us from being tainted by his "germs".

Even so, Congress doesn't have to tie its hands to do something meaningful about the deficit right this minute. Republicans need only find the political courage to embrace compromise and take the president up on his offer of a "grand deal" involving trillions of dollars in spending cuts and, to a lesser extent, tax reform that closes wasteful loopholes and requires a greater contribution from the wealthy.
Matheny kept the momentum up with another goal just 26 seconds into the second period when he took a pass from the half-boards and unleashed a beautiful wrist shot past Ware.

The venture's Vin Ver'Ray Syrah is a delicious, full-bodied, voluptuous wine that has an enticing smoky aroma reminiscent of bacon. It's complex and lush with layers of black fruit, cedar and spice and a long, silky finish. This mouthwatering wine makes you want to take sip after sip, and it is so well-balanced that you'd never suspect that the alcohol is 15.3 percent. Although the wine is well worth the $21.95 that Schnucks is now charging, it can be found for about $5 to $6 less at other retailers, including Clayton's Wine Merchant and the Wine & Cheese Place.
"Everybody wants to be the leading scorer," Montgomery said. "He was upset after the Oregon game, feeling he didn't play well. (With his) leadership, I don't have to explain anything to Harper.

Key to funding Fiat's turnaround were a pair of savvy financial moves. One was a $2 billion payment from General Motors to walk away from an option to buy Fiat, which at the time was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Another that received less buzz but was just as important was a deal to get suppliers to cut costs by up to 5 percent, said Francesco Zirpoli, an expert in organizational innovation at the University of Salerno.

So yeah, it was a laugher here Tuesday, Portland beating the Spurs 137-97. But the game-behind-the-game was nerve wracking. The Blazers are hovering around the eighth and final playoff spot in the West. And it feels like change is needed. It may not be the big change this team needs to become a factor -- like an upgrade at point guard -- but it could be a change that improves the team.

Columbia River: The team hopes to regroup after starting fast but losing nine of its last 10 games to finish 8-12 a year ago. Columbia River returns three starters in forward Isaiah Smith and guards Brandon Scheidel and Gunnar Wahl. Smith, a 6-7 sophomore, averaged 11.3 points last season. Coach David Long said Columbia River "might be the deepest team I've ever coached." Some of that depth comes from a junior varsity team that was 18-2 a year ago.

According to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, roughly 20 percent of all fantasy players are women. That's about 5.4 million ladies who share a passion for the game. And there's plenty of room for growth, if you scan the stands at games Sunday. I'd be surprised if women aren't the fastest-growing segment of the market in the next several years.

After all, the commissioner is the driving force behind adding a second wild-card team in both leagues to give baseball 10 teams in the playoffs."I don't want to be too critical of me," he said before Game 2 between the Brewers and Cardinals in the NLCS. "But baseball still has the fewest number of teams in the playoffs. Ten out of 30 is fair."But when and how the expanded playoffs would start isn't that easy. For example, would it require realignment? There are currently an uneven number of teams in the AL (14) and NL

The senior sharpshooter came in averaging 17.1 points per game on the strength of an area-high 62 3-pointers. He also hit two free throws in the second quarter to account for all five of his points in the game -- 12 below his season average. The key seemed to be a fresh rotation of Lafayette defenders assigned to Dolan as the game progressed.
It's a bold assertion, although he isn't the first to loft Ellington into the dress circle of music history. In 1944, The New Yorker ran a profile of Ellington called "The Hot Bach."

Right from his first films in Poland, Polanski’s best movies were marked by a wry absurdism, convinced of nothing but looming, unavoidable disaster. And the bitterest gag was that the heroes — sometimes played by Polanski himself — were never in on the joke.
In a note to investors, BernsteinResearch analyst Dr. Tim Anderson wrote that Merck's story "is not terribly exciting" right now but that the company is "still a well-run organization that likely has better future pipeline" prospects than its peers.

The Cardinals' schedule, which includes television coverage of every game again, was released Thursday and the most notable item is that they have only two home games set for late-afternoon starts.

Here's the deal: Reverse mortgages are for people ages 62 and over who have a lot of equity in their homes. You can borrow a chunk of the equity, put it in your pocket or pay off debt. You'll make no payments on the reverse mortgage as long as you live in the house - provided that you pay the taxes and insurance and don't wreck the place. When you move out, the house is sold and the lender paid off.
On the other end of the spectrum, there was Paulina Rubio in a sharp-shouldered sequined onesie in fishnets. (Let me just say, the word onesie should never appear in a fashion commentary. Ever.

Alejandra Guzman's designer apparently hit the closeout sale at the Rag Shop, picking up gold-trimmed black lace, teal silk and black satin for a song. Too bad he or she forgot to make the dress.

The Pearl company recently did Ionesco’s signature work “The Bald Soprano,” from 1950, and two and a half years ago, Geoffrey Rush won a Tony for his turn in a revival of 1962’s “Exit the King.” But overall, the Romania-born, France-based Ionesco isn’t produced very often here — probably because his nonsensical MO is devilishly hard to stage well.

2008, United States, 103 minutes. Jay McCarroll, the winner of "Project Runway's" first season, tries to find life after reality TV in Michael Selditch and Rob Tate's "Eleven Minutes," which takes its name from how long a runway show lasts. The film follows McCarroll during the year he prepares for his first runway show during New York's Fashion Week. Much of it is amusing, and it does a good job of showing how vapid the world of fashion wannabes can be. At the same time, the film is exhausting and long. Apparently every film editor in New York was busy while Selditch and Tate were cutting this movie. Watch the first half hour, go out for pizza and then come back for the last 20 minutes and you'll find it enjoyable. As for McCarroll, he has a certain naive appeal as a character and some of his designs are inventive, but as Scott Fitzgerald might have said, there are no second acts in reality-TV lives.
The RoboLions went on to win one more round and lost two. At the last match, Quorra's "brain" shut down, and the team spent the evening trying to fix the problem. Today, the team will learn whether it ranks as one of the top eight teams. If so, it will select two other teams to form a permanent alliance and compete for the championship.
“I don’t know how you could have a question after" Tuesday, Coughlin said in reference to Super Bowl XLVI Media Day. “I was okay until that guy came over in the, what was that, Adventureman suit?

Only one traditional musical, "Curtains," managed a major award: David Hyde Pierce's for best actor in his comic turn as a stage-struck detective investigating the death of the leading lady of a 1950s musical.
Back for lunch, I liked the look better with light from the windows lightening the mood. Even with several tables nearby – a group of businessmen in suits and a multigenerational family – we could easily chat without raising our voices. We each ordered a mango lassi made with sweet canned mango pulp imported from India and tangy yogurt, made in house three times a week. While refreshing and delicious, they cost more than a Jamba Juice smoothie at $6.25 each.

We ended our visit at a tasting lounge with a wood bar framed by large paintings of Argentine landscapes. Later we made our way to Familia Zuccardi for our spectacular lunch. It was so good, in fact, that we returned at day's end to experience their tasting room, where a pleasant sommelier from Britain with dreams of becoming a winemaker awed us with his knowledge of Argentine malbecs. We ended up buying a few bottles, along with some house olive oil.

Western Soondae, open 24 hours a day, is a great introduction. The simple modern room has a party-time vibe even at high noon when it's mobbed with office workers filling up on the bargain soondae soup. Late at night, post-clubbing packs of young dudes relax, ordering up shots of soju and beers to go with vast anju combo platters (Korea's version of tapas) that feature soondae and Korean-style cold cuts. Or they'll get bubbling pans of soondae bokum, a vibrant, lightly cooked stew of sausage chunks, vegetables and barely wilted perilla leaves that spurts volcanic sauce from its superheated iron plate.

Federal courts have delayed two other executions this year over concerns that Ohio deviates too often from its written injection rules.
Everything about Cyril's situation is uncertain, and that sensibility saturates the movie so completely that it makes everything that follows  the good things, especially  as hard for us to trust in as they are for the boy. Somehow Samantha finds Cyril's bike, a tentative bond is forged and soon she is taking him for weekends. But like potholes that pock the streets that Cyril races around on, it's a bumpy ride. It is impossible to guess exactly where things are headed  the film, Cyril's life or his tie to Samantha.

"It's never been like that with the Flyers. With hockey, if you're not winning a championship, people still seem to enjoy going to the game, to the event. With the Sixers, we have an exciting basketball team. I enjoyed every game I went to last year. To me, it's great entertainment. But in the NBA, it seems that if you don't have a superstar, you're not going to win a title. That's unfortunate.
"It makes me happy inside," said 10-year-old Jasmine Hernandez, whose quality-control job required her to ensure each finished package was the appropriate weight. "I feel very helpful. I know there are kids less fortunate than me, and I really want to help them."

In Toronto, public opinion was mixed, and opponents voiced concern that building a suicide barrier at the Bloor Street Viaduct would only divert jumpers to another bridge. Among the material presented to the Toronto council was a study concerning two Washington, D.C., bridges, the Duke Ellington and the Taft. The structures were a block apart, but the Ellington bridge was the favorite of the suicide-prone. When a suicide barrier was installed on the Ellington bridge in 1986, suicides there stopped, and the rate of suicide at the Taft bridge did not increase.
Much of his experience, he says, has been with large commercial ships, freighters, tankers and passenger vessels. Now based in Washington, D.C., at the Coast Guard’s Office of Traveling Inspections and National Centers of Expertise, McAvoy says he has taken part in 20 to 24 casualty investigations over the past two decades — none involving sunken fishing vessels.

Where I grew up, the new man next door had four dirt track stock cars he warmed up before he left for work in the morning. He'd fire one up, then another, the pitch of their engines moving in and out of deep harmony.
It might sound odd to say a $53,000 sedan is well-priced, but you get quite a bit for the XF's starting price, which is more than other luxury marques. There are the bi-xenon high-intensity-discharge and LED headlights I mentioned earlier - which also get their own washers - plus rain-sensing windshield wipers, a moonroof, leather seats (they're heated in front), and keyless entry and ignition.
Cost: $31-$92.
Winds from the south drove the area to that temperature, 20 to 25 degrees above normal for early March, according to the National Weather Service in Weldon Spring. It was a blustery day, with gusts of up to 45 mph and a wind advisory until 6 p.m. in most of the area.
Obama, already the first sitting president to appear on "The Tonight Show," "The Late Show" and "The Daily Show," treaded even deeper into the overnight hours as part of his two-day, three-state tour of college campuses to press his case to extend lower interest rates for some student loan programs.
"We like the way our team has responded to the coaching change," Armstrong said. "At the end of the day, we want to have more wins than losses. And whether we score two goals or one goal to do it, I'm not losing sight of the fact that we're playing some good hockey right now."
But an early French pullout could have symbolic consequences or give cover to other countries eager to withdraw. Hollande's advisers say they are wary of putting undue political strain on Obama ahead of his re-election bid in November.
Marine Staff Sgt. Joseph D'Augustine was killed on Tuesday, March 27 doing the dangerous work he'd been trained to do: diffusing explosives as part of a ordnance disposal unit. He was 29 years old.

"You’re so angry, aren’t you? Work it all out," Christie said before blaming the outburst on President Obama. "They represent an anger in our country that Barack Obama has caused. Because he is a typical, cynical Chicago ward politician who runs for office and promises everything and then comes to office and disappoints."
Robinson speculated that there might be more complaints from employees than from the general public. Unlike Government Center in Minneapolis, there is no fast lane for those who work in the suburban buildings. They have to go through the same screening as everyone else, each time they enter. That means a few extra minutes each day -- even leaving for lunch becomes more of a hassle.
The IRS rolled out the system upgrades at the end of last year, and said the changes would result in faster turnaround time for refunds as well as stronger anti-fraud safeguards. The agency said that 90 percent of filers will receive their refunds with between 10 to 21 days after filing.

Patients will visit the same doctors at the same location, with the same office personnel. The center will continue to offer radiological and diagnostic services, including mammograms, bone density testing, X-rays, ultrasound, and laboratory services.
In many ways, Seau had the kind of career of which every athlete dreams. A San Diego native, he was drafted in the first round by his hometown Chargers in 1990, spent 13 decorated and glorious seasons with the franchise and became arguably its greatest player ever -- certainly its most popular. He was also the fiery defensive force behind the only Super Bowl team in Chargers' history, the star-crossed 1994 squad that's now seen an alarming eight former members die before the age of 45.

* Monday was the first day Jets coaches could be on the field with players. So what did Ryan think of his new quarterback, Tim Tebow? “I saw enough of Tebow last year, to be honest with you, especially that last drive,” Ryan deadpanned. “Like I’ve said before, this guy’s an outstanding football player. We’ll see what we can come up with.” ... The Jets agreed to a deal with kicker Josh Brown yesterday, Ryan confirmed. Brown will compete with incumbent Nick Folk for the starting job. The Rams recently released Brown after four seasons with the team. ... The Jets also waived wide receiver Logan Payne.

Anyway, reading between the lines, Moody's seems to be signaling relief that, if all goes as Kasich aims for it to go, Ohio's budget is "expected to return to structural balance" -- that's CPA bafflegab for "no more gimmicks" -- in 2013.
In 1895, records show that 49 fires burned 60,000 acres in Burlington, Atlantic and Ocean counties. Other surveys in 1872 and 1885 indicate that as many as 100,000 to 130,000 acres burned annually in the Pine Barrens region alone.

It was the last formal piece on the program Wednesday. The title translates “Saying Goodbye,” and was written by Farr and Nunns in 2008 for a Dawn Service Commemoration in Gallipoli, Turkey. A sweet hymn-like melody in the string quartet is remotely Ivesian. But Nunns' poignant playing of a Maori flute invited the ancients to the ceremony. The result was not a clash of civilizations but, in a timeless quiet before the dawn, a yearning intersection of yawning traditions.
And then, thank the heaven and all its stars, Sandy told us to repeat. Repeat? I did a little better the second time but still smiled really hard attempting to convince everyone around me I was having fun when the truth was, my mind hurt from trying to concentrate.
Black said independent voters tend to decide late in the process. That will give them about six months to compare Obama with Romney — if Romney is the nominee — and the economy will be the big issue.
The directors use animation to illustrate the band's members, who grew up in South Central LA, being bused to the San Fernando Valley for school, where they would be exposed to punk rock, a big element of Fishbone's genuinely eclectic sound. The segment works as both a funny cartoon and as an offbeat way to get at their feelings about being uprooted. They would hook up with Angelo Moore, an enigmatic Jehovah's Witness who would become the closest thing Fishbone had to a leader (as their former manager puts it, if the band had been a little less democratic, it might have gotten more popular).
The bread. Surely it was going to be a little thing like the bread. One night, we were down to our last slice. The restaurant was very busy. The butter was half gone. Then in swoops an assistant waiter who whisks away the basket and drops off more bread. He didn't ask. He just knew. It's that kind of anticipation, little by little, that adds up to great service.

"They were like kids in a candy store," he said before the meeting. "We need to stop take a deep breath, step back and think about what we're doing and slow down. If we don't slow down, this is going to continue."
As with pat downs, metal detectors and full-body scanners, passengers seemed to take the latest security measure in stride. "You can’t fault them," said Gloria McKenney, a white-haired woman waiting to be screened today for her flight from Newark back home to Portland, Ore. "They’re doing what they can do to protect us."
Aldridge, who said he came out "tentative" at the start, committed an early turnover, picked up two quick fouls and missed his first two shots. He didn't make his first field goal until he converted a layup off a nice pass from Gerald Wallace with 2:27 left in the first quarter. The Blazers struggled to get him the ball through the flow of the offense and he labored to get open throughout the first.
Post-bankruptcy, with a leaner cost structure, American's biggest challenge will be to find an airline (1) with a good route and product fit and (2) willing to merge with American. The most often mentioned target has been Alaska -- a well-managed line with a reputation for a quality product and route structure that would greatly expand American's reach in the West. At least so far, however, Alaska has maintained a position of "no, thanks" to any such offer. The other unaffiliated big airline is US Airways, but its route fit isn't anywhere close to being as good as Alaska's, and many believe that it's not an attractive merger possibility. American would love to merge with British Airways, but that's not going to happen for decades, if ever. And even the biggest low-fare line (other than Southwest, of course, but that's unlikely) would be too small an addition to make any significant dent in American's market position, let alone the problems with huge product differences.
Such bitterly contested primaries underscore the short-term and long-term challenges facing Republicans.
He nodded vaguely toward an earmark ban, lower corporate taxes, a simplified tax code for everyone, the discarding of "unnecessary" government regulations and entitlement reform. Somebody will get back to us with specifics. Someday. Or not.
Besides the police budget vote, Waters says Fong hasn't paid enough attention to community appearance concerns, such as signs cluttering utility poles and roadsides, and has voted too often with Rob Fong. Other than redistricting and hiring new City Manager John Shirey, Fong also agreed with Rob Fong on opposing a controversial "crash tax" on out-of-town motorists designed to boost the Fire Department.

A gregarious figure with a football linebacker's frame, Bruno has pushed the church in a more liberal direction. In May 2010, he ordained the region's first two female bishops, one of whom was the first lesbian bishop ordained in the history of the Episcopal Church. Bruno openly opposed Proposition 8, which bars same-sex marriages. His support of gay rights did not waver even when conservative worshipers split from the church because of its liberal policies.

And I'll look forward to returning to the column in a few months.
Poverty is growing in many areas of the state -- most of it directly related to the housing collapse and the long recession. Vermilion Local School District Superintendent Philip M.

"You’d be hard-pressed to find any economist to agree with those predictions," Harrison said.
“Maybe just regrouping a little bit,” Zach Parise, a relentless penalty-killer, said. “One of the biggest things is we’ve done a better job on faceoffs. It’s so important when you win that initial draw and you get that initial clear. Right away there are 10-15 seconds off the draw… I think that’s one of our strengths, not allowing teams to set up.”
Faced with what the state's attorneys described as a "devastating, ongoing and deepening financial crisis," the California Legislature approved reimbursement cuts in 2008 and 2009 of between 1 percent and 10 percent.

Charles Pelkie, spokesman for the Will County state's attorney's office, said court records don't explain why Marszalek was given a supervision in this instance. He said a traffic court prosecutor might see 1,000 cases in a month and would rely on an office database to show a driver's previous supervisions. He speculated that the prosecutor was unaware of Marszalek's most recent supervision because it was given just one month before his Will County court date.
