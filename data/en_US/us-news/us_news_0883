Fourth and finally, the wisdom: Stegner's novels (and so often those of his students in the program) by withholding judgment teach the reader something about what kind of person he or she wants to be. Consider this simple sentence: "looking back, he thought she was only as happy as a person waiting for the next phase of her life might be." Such insights require not only experience and intelligence but also patience and wisdom. "To Be Sung Underwater" is blessed with these qualities.

"For most workers, it is best to exit quietly and not burn any bridges.

But positive is in the eyes of the beholder. It wasn't my responsibility to be the guy."

With a saturation of cultural reference, "Solar Dance" conveys the heady atmosphere that made Berlin the first European capital to embrace the transforming potential of art in a secular age. Yet it also created the ideological void that ended in the rise of Hitler. Van Gogh was celebrated as a solitary genius whose paintings rebelled "against the formalism of the establishment" and made "the untamed decorative"; but the potential for fakery in his messy oeuvre, and for embellishment of his biography, risked introducing just the kind of "fantasy world of myth and mastery" that drew people to National Socialism—a process Mr. Eksteins recounts in the final part of the book.

SEVENTH RACE: While favoritism in the race at post time belonged to Debase the Dollar, the second choice at 3-1 was the well bred first-time starter Antonia Autumn. A half sister to multiple Eclipse Award winner Gio Ponti, she is also trained by Christophe Clement and was being ridden by Gio Ponti’s regular jock Ramon Dominguez. She rated off the pace for most of the race but when turning for home, without much urging, Antonia Autumn just exploded and split horses to gain the lead and easily hold off Debase the Dollar for the victory. She definitely has a bright future ahead of her.

I nodded, while I silently calculated how long doing the dishes and vacuuming would take, so I could figure out how much TV to watch instead. Just a few weeks later, I was buying a moisturizing face mask --I know, I'm a sucker for promising ointments --and the esthetician told me to put the mask on after washing my face at night and then to leave it on as long as it took to "do some dusting." First of all, how does she know how much time it takes me to dust? Maybe I live in a mansion and it takes hours to Swiffer all my busts and Old Masters. Maybe I live in a studio apartment and don't even have a Swiffer duster.

He's got a strong arm, he's a good athlete. We just like everything about the kid and we're really excited to have him."

SF had the NFL's top run defense during the regular season, so how the Giants fare on the ground could be integral - especially if the field is slipper.

Nike's president and chief executive officer, Mark Parker, is a Penn State graduate. Maybe he can't see past the myth that was Paterno. Maybe he's waiting to gauge public sentiment, but what's left to gauge? Maybe try putting someone's name on the building who championed children?

With its power to turn the dial on interest rates, the Federal Reserve has unmatched muscle to control economic growth, employment and inflation.

about the St. Louis-based American Sports and Fitness Association, which certifies personal trainers, nutritionists and the like. To get the association's certification, aspiring trainers must take an online test. It's pretty tough - at least the first time. After that, the association's website tells you which questions you got wrong and either gives the right answer or offers obvious hints. Ace the same test on your second try and you can buy your certification. Lesson for consumers: Your personal trainer might not be as qualified as his framed certification suggests.

Newton did a better job handling what the Texans brought. He took what was there yet was aggressive when the odds were in his favor, and he pulled the ball down to run (seven carries for 55 yards) when no one was open. He looked to be in complete control and pointed to the repetitions he has had as the starter since the beginning of the season helping him get to this point.

Visiting places tourists would normally miss is what volunteer vacations are all about. After a day and half of clinic work, our LMV team headed for Gonzaga Bay, on the Sea of Cortés, nearly inaccessible except by boat or plane.

During the Nairobi airport layover, teams run through the halls. Someone might have been shoved, but it must not have been caught on camera because anytime they catch anything remotely physical on camera they replay it about five times (and usually I still can’t figure out what happened). No replay here, so you just have to imagine that VaRalpha and BB got a little thrown together in a hallway.

There are no bad seats in the 550-capacity Hanna, home of Great Lakes Theater Festival, thanks to the "thrust" configuration of the stage, which juts out into the audience chamber. The seats, arranged on steeply raked tiers around the stage, are no farther than 12 rows from the action. And you have your choice of the kind of seat you'd like. Almost all the regular theater chairs are wider and the rows farther apart than standard. The balcony and historic boxes (neither recommended for the vertiginous) have dining-room type chairs. You can perch on a barstool or slouch in a chair around a table of friends in the bar and lounge seating areas. Or, perhaps best of all, try one of the club chairs (Row L, orchestra) or cozy banquettes (just behind the club chairs) for a completely relaxed eagle-eye view; both come complete with a shelf to park your glass of wine or pint of ale. Now, bring on the Shakespeare. -- Tony Brown, Plain Dealer Theater Critic

No control of these insects is necessary.

2009 Beaux Freres Vineyard Ribbon Ridge Pinot Noir ($80, 14.2%): Michael Etzel's Beaux Freres has long earned its reputation of being among the most polished and, dare we say, the most Californian among Oregon's roster.

The Blind Cafe experience is all about making peace with disorientation. Diners are led by one of the waiters through a darkened tunnel into the event space, where they are seated at one of 13 long tables. The diners then touch tabletops, locating paper plates, plastic utensils and water glasses, before feeling around for serving bowls filled with food to be served family style. Because it's not clear how many bowls there are and how much food there is, people dish up food conservatively, making sure there's plenty to go around.

Romney, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, faced one of the biggest challenges of his four years in office. His response would alienate constituencies on both sides and contribute to criticisms that he shifted positions for political gain, a charge renewed in his two bids for the White House.

What are they using for bleach, and how strong is it? A 10 percent carbamide peroxide solution is American Dental Association-approved for use in at-home teeth-whitening products; so it's pretty safe for it to be given to you by a secretary with a second job. (In most, if not all, of these places, the workers don't actually apply the bleach to your teeth -- you do.) But it doesn't pack a lot of whitening power.

Does your running around in circles feel a little different this week? Do you have so much ground to cover that you feel like you're running around in a loopy shape that makes two circles, one stacked on top of the other? It's the week of 08/08/08, and Friday magazine's cover story celebrates that number, which looks a little bit like a snowman.

"Dark Shadows": A cast that includes Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter plays the 1966-71 gothic soap opera for laughs. Tim Burton ("Alice in Wonderland," "Edward Scissorhands") directs. Rated PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content, language and drug use.
"For some hospitals, that may tip the scale," he said. "It takes two to three years to get something built, so they may be waiting. Though one positive thing right now is interest rates are the lowest they've ever been. If they are going to do it, now is a good time."

As a father, I found the tape obscene.
"Economic interests are overwhelming the principle of one man, one vote," said Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who was outspent this fall by a previously unknown opponent and outside groups that ran ads attacking Frank. The only solution, short of legislation to overturn recent federal court rulings, Frank said, is "to raise more money on our side," even if the funds come from anonymous donors.
ø"Now is the worst time in a tight economy to cut women's pay and deny them the kind of fairness they deserve," she said.
As tiny as a single grain of rice, bedbugs hide inside furniture and bedding, which is why the sense of smell is a better weapon than sight. The average human has merely five million scent receptors in his or her nose; the average dog, 200 million to 250 million. Canines, which have been trained to sniff out everything from illegal drugs to gypsy moths, are capable of locating bedbugs with 97 percent accuracy, according to a 2008 study from University of Florida.

Marucci is now presenting dishes that go beyond the expected into the dazzling, like a pan-seared foie gras served with kumquats and Sicilian pistachios, and a soup made from local turnips with a black-garlic puree, and bread dumplings. None of these feels borrowed, or even indirectly inspired by northern Italian cuisine. They feel like things Marucci invented. They are all beautifully and simply presented with a minimum of fuss, and they all deliver complex and surprising flavors.

A: It's not just a question of how long, but also how many. Since losing Disney and Sony (after it failed to renew its deal with distributor Starz), Netflix has had to make do with a modicum of new releases for streaming - most from Lionsgate, MGM and Paramount. Movies generally go to DVD (and TV rental) around three months after their theatrical release. Expect to wait an additional three months to stream them on Netflix. The release process for blockbusters can take much longer, and some films may never be offered through an $8 per-month streaming service. Jennifer Lawrence could be an old lady before you see "The Hunger Games" streaming on Netflix.

"The secretly funded Chamber falsely claims that Sen. Sherrod Brown voted to raise taxes," Barasky said late Wednesday morning. "In reality he voted to end massive tax breaks for only the five biggest oil companies who are enjoying billions in profits while Ohioans struggle with prices at the pump. But no amount of undisclosed cash will hide the fact that when it comes to protecting Big Oil tax breaks, on this issue as with so many others, Josh Mandel refuses to stand with middle-class Ohioans."

The policemen challenged charges brought against them for failing to cooperate with the commission as it investigated the fatal shooting of two men in August 2010.
Such support helps create what venture capitalists call deal flow. They generally want to invest in companies with a proven technology that's almost ready for market, but getting to that point takes money.
Researchers have found the thick dust and debris plume resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center contained a toxic mix of compounds including asbestos, lead, and partially burned or unburned jet fuel that have long raised concerns over the long-term health of rescue workers, nearby residents and commuters who were exposed to it in the days following the terrorist attacks.

As a community-supported agriculture farm, this one-acre vegetable and flower patch sells 'shares' to members who pick up a weekly haul of produce. Many members make the steep, twisty trip to the farm, where boat horns rise from the Columbia River below and bird calls echo from the fir trees above. Wealth Underground fulfills the college dream of three 20-something buddies, who literally wear their passion on their jackets, with matching antler-tip symbols of unity. Reflecting on the unapologetically over-the-top 'Portlandia,' farm co-founder Nolan Calisch jokes: 'This is exactly what they wanted to make fun of.'

Bison fans say the meat doesn't taste gamy -- it has a rich, beefy flavor but is a little sweeter. Since it's so lean, chefs say preparing it properly requires slower cooking over lower heat than beef. They say steaks shouldn't be cooked past medium or medium rare. Those who prefer meat well done might want to try a bison pot roast.
At the risk of seeming picky, I'd like to clarify Flinn's reference to trespass and the right to roam. It is true that we now enjoy the right to roam across large swaths of the countryside in England and Wales, but this applies mainly in what we call open country, principally the unfenced uplands. In the hedge-lined lowlands, through which the Offa's Dyke Path also passes, walkers still have to stick to defined paths. There are lots of these, though. If in doubt, refer to the 21/2-inch-to-the-mile Ordnance Survey Explorer Map, which shows both legally defined open country and public rights of way.
The orange fruit will echo fall-planted mums and complement purple asters, he hopes. He also is considering a clump of corn, to provide a vertical dimension and as a stand-in for grassy ornamentals. "It's just a different texture," Mr. Boyer says.

There had been calls for fans to boycott Kings games to deprive the Maloof family of further income from Sacramento residents as the team apparently prepares to leave for Anaheim. The late-season crowd -- one of the biggest of the season -- for a game without a single playoff implication shows that fans really want a few final tastes of NBA basketball. Can't blame anyone for that.
Only 1.6 percent of the student-athletes in California transferred last year. Of that 1.6 percent, 94 percent were granted unlimited eligibility at their new school. Only .08 percent of all participants were granted limited eligibility or denied eligibility.

A study released Tuesday by PayNet, a research firm that tracks loans to small business, shows that lending fell 3 percent in March.
Vaughn, the former City-County Council president, soon will take charge of steering the Republican mayor's agenda through increasingly treacherous waters. That's true in the General Assembly, which this year resisted authorizing a local transit referendum. It's even more evident in the council, where the new Democratic majority could complicate the mayor's priorities in the nearly $1 billion city/county budget and on plenty of other issues.

However, as Max Fisher of The Atlantic notes, Breivik's killings have instead put heavy international pressure on the far right.

"The most important thing is to actually look for something that works for you, and this will be different for each person," he says.

As in track and field with doping, so with baseball: Awe yields to doubt. Genuine accomplishments are more tainted than they would have been had a ball-and-chain of asterisks clattered after them.

Don seems particularly flustered by Megan's group of friends, who are all artsy and beatnik-y and non-white (they're in a band that performs at the apartment, alternating between swinging jazz and Burt Bacharach-y pop). There's even — shock — a friend who is black AND gay! "My god, is he queer!" Harry notes, reminding us how stuck in the old ways of life Harry and the rest of SCDP remain about some things. However, Harry says he's "going to smoke tea with Megan's friends," so apparently he's OK with that part of society changing.

It has been two years since the Supreme Court issued its decision in the case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, and we are only now just beginning to see how its overturning of a century of campaign finance law is distorting the electoral process. Rather than acting truly independently of campaigns, as the majority of justices envisioned, these entities exclusively act on behalf of individual candidates — and are typically run by former aides. Rather than encouraging the universal right of free speech, the ruling has had the effect of providing a megaphone for the rich to drown out all other voices.
