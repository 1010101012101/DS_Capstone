Come summer, federal wildlife officials expect to finish a draft environmental impact statement that most likely recommends taking to the woods with shotguns. Over the next year, in three or more study areas from Washington to northern California, they might kill 1,200 to 1,500 barred owls -- the larger, more aggressive competitor that has routed spotted owls from much of their territory and become, along with habitat loss, the biggest threat to their survival.
DeWine's move comes as Republican congressional leaders push forward with a bill to repeal the plan.

ø4. Pat Brisson (agent): All that probably stands between Brisson and landing a GM job is his decision to commit to that line of work. His name often pops up when a general manager's job is open. He's smart, personable and knows the game and its players. With many top clients, including Sidney Crosby, Brisson has long been an NHL mover and shaker. People listen to Brisson because he thinks before he speaks. If the Canadiens make changes this summer, he also could be an intriguing candidate.

For evidence, look no further than the brand new contracts the Brown Administration has just negotiated with many of its workers. The budget package Brown is piecing together relies in part on a savings of 10 percent from these contracts.

"It's a frustrating thing when you don't score on the (power play)," Arnott said. "That's what we're out there to do. The main thing is, we just stick with our game plan and stay focused. We knew that if we stuck with it, goals were going to come."
"It was a mutual thing," Arnott said. "They couldn't give me an answer. They were kind of leaning towards going a little younger (lineup). It was time for me to move on at that time, and if they were willing to move me, then I would have been moved. I had a no-move and no-trade (clause).

Miss Forcible/Miss Spink: The British comedy duo of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French ("Absolutely Fabulous")
There won’t be any interim election, because the real thing is happening right away, on March 5, 2013. So in those intervening weeks, would the council leave things to Acting Mayor Wesson, or would it appoint someone else? If the council wanted to give a boost to one of the declared mayoral candidates in the days before the election, it could appoint Eric Garcetti, Jan Perry or Wendy Greuel, although whichever of them it would be would have to give up his or her current office. It could appoint Kevin James or Austin Beutner. Or someone else. But it’s hard to imagine a council led by Wesson appointing someone not of Wesson’s choosing.

One potential solution is a model Residential Renewable Energy Rights Act that could serve as a basis for uniform legislation at the state level that would bar new restrictions on residential wind and solar instillations while simultaneously rendering existing ones unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Coupled with a robust program of state and federal incentives, rebates, and credits for residential and larger-scale local or community-owned renewable power generation projects, a Residential Renewable Energy Rights Act would help lay the foundation for a radical transformation in American energy production.
Delightfully, I was wrong. Delivering quite well on its "Here there be monsters" hook, "Grimm" also hits all the notes of a classic hero-in-disguise story — recently discovered powers, magical talisman (a book, some really wicked looking weaponry), loyal if quirky sidekick (a "tame" werewolf named Monroe played by Silas Weir Mitchell), a gal in peril (Nick's fiancé, who it has been recommended he ditch to protect) and, of course, a series of obstacles that must be overcome in secret because no one can know he is a Grimm.

Most rookies don't embrace defense. In most cases, it's not what made them lottery picks. They don't realize the effort required or don't bring it with any consistency. That's the case with the 19-year-old Irving, who has already doubled his work load after playing just 11 games at Duke last season.

After a root beer float ($3.50) at the vintage lunch counter, take time to explore the well-curated exhibits that fill the depot's sepia-tinged rooms. Then wander along the colonnade that fronts the railway, where signs forlornly announce long-forgotten passenger services even as ponderously laden freight trains roll past. The freight trains are noisy reminders of the fact that Kelso was built only to make other journeys possible. Now, in retirement, this palm-shaded intersection of history, geography and railway is at last a destination itself.

Mr. Trichet's assent was vital. If the ECB were to stop accepting Greek bonds as collateral for its lending to banks on the grounds that the bonds were in default, then Greece's banks, which were stuffed full of their government's bonds, would quickly run out of cash and collapse. That would radically drive up the cost of a rescue.

Sure, it's a little amusing now to picture the 6-foot-4, 299-pound defensive tackle replacing little Nick Williams on UConn returns and breaking a big one against Rutgers.

And 40% said they considered their income taxes unfair, up from 36% in 2010. The trend has reversed among people who make more than $30,000 a year, but it has persisted among lower income Americans.

The Sun's editorial regarding Maryland's carry law ("Attack on Md. gun laws," March 7) showed a bias against guns and law-abiding citizens who might choose to carry them. The justification for great concern over qualified, law-abiding citizens carrying guns is the threat handguns pose to citizens of Maryland. You did not mention the appalling number of murders in Maryland that the existing restrictive permit laws did nothing to stop. Criminals don't have a permit problem, and they don't have to worry about the average citizen being armed.

We can all agree that the time has come for this nation to adopt a more sensible, humane and cost-effective drug policy. Our capacity for meaningful change is contingent on understanding the nature of the problem. If we are serious about reducing substance abuse, crime and recidivism, and saving taxpayers money, then we must accept that our criminal-justice system is filled with seriously addicted people who need treatment to change their behavior. Drug courts must be the foundation of reform.

I'll spare you all the details, except to say that no one was physically injured. I don't understand why some kids bully, but I think I understand now why one particular boy bullies: his father is a bully. This morning I told my son (who, by the way, is terrified to be out of the house now) that I almost feel sorry for the son in that family. He's probably been on the receiving end of some of that bullying. My son didn't see my point. He's not ready to feel compassion in this situation yet, and I don't blame him.

Woody, I dig your style dude. Monday comes and I see you writing about CU and CSU basketball getting into the tournament and NOT about Peyton Manning. Gutsy! Seriously, Buffs and RAms are good stories that should be talked about. Good work.
Off-peak energy. The home's efficient building envelope means the house stays so cool that, even in summer, Fedoruk doesn't have to turn on the AC during the day. He'll often run it at 9 p.m., past peak energy-usage hours.

I’m dating a guy who moved to NYC three months ago. I’m having a great time seeing the city for the first time through his eyes, but playing tour guide is starting to drag. Sometimes it feels like because I know which way is uptown and where to get the best slice, maybe he’s using me for my Big Apple know-how. How can I get him to take initiative? Also, how do I know if the relationship has potential or will be chucked once he learns the subway system?
"It seems like each and every game he's starting to get a little bit more comfortable in that role," coach Byron Scott said. "I still think it's going to take him time to really feel that he can be the leader that we want him to be, which is understandable.
Also, remember teams have three $1.5-million veteran exceptions to use against future years' caps. So once again, having a number is great but it doesn't give the full picture. Only the team has that because they know the plans.

You actually don't know that her husband doesn't know, do you - nor do you know your ex-paramour has escaped without consequences, right? You aren't privy to either. He could know - or, her guilt could inflict time-release damage worse than any you suffered. She could also, of course, be conscience-challenged and deep into another affair by now, but what kind of life is that, besides bankrupt?
After US Fidelis filed for bankruptcy on March 1, an independent management team sued the company's owners -- Darain and Cory Atkinson -- and accused them of plundering the firm.

The commissioner's office said the 38-year-old Mota tested positive for Clenbuterol. In November 2006, while with the New York Mets, Mota was suspended for the first 50 games of the next season.
This is another instance where the person who deserved to win the game, and the only one with actions that lent toward the season's interest level, was purposely removed from the game for fear that he would win. I was appalled to see that no one called Coach out on his reason for voting Ozzie out of the game, when he had clearly made a pact with him, and had several reasons to keep his pack with Ozzie while abandoning the promises he had made to Albert. Albert clearly lied and had crossed their alliance on numerous occasions, thus Coach would have been justified in letting him go directly or letting Ozzie defeat him in the ending. HOWEVER, coward that he was, he knew that if he took Ozzie to the end that the jury would almost unanimously vote for Ozzie because he was indeed most deserving of the title. I was irritated enough when Russell Hantz didn't win just because people were bitter that he had duped them, but this is just a whole new level of absurdity. This just shows that it really doesn't matter whether you're a strategic or a physical player. The only thing that matters is whose that you're lazy enough to fly under the radar and kiss everyone's ass. That's not a survivor, that's just an ass kisser.
Not to be disagreeable, the record reflects something different. The City has been clear that the $100 million is the beginning, not the end, of negotiations. To that end the City has offered a wide range of proposals to the County with intent to advance the negotiation to agreement. To date, the County has expressed no interest in any of these proposals. The City has also repeatedly expressed a willingness to entertain whatever proposals the County may want to put forth. To date, the County hasn't put any substantive proposal before the City.

Gladys Knight, calling herself the "grandma of rock and roll," tackled a tango to Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody." Not easy! "By far your most ambitious routine," said Carrie Ann, noting that it didn't quite all come together. Len praised Gladys for coping well with the music, but said she needed to be crisp.

“We haven’t reduced any number of wolves,” Ealey added. “We have parts of the boreal forest where there are some development activities that change the habitat that makes it more attractive to other prey, like deer, moose and elk. The increased alternative prey provides food for wolves and the wolf population increases as a result.” He also noted that wildfires can have the same effect, making the habitat unsuitable for caribou, but other prey species move in and the wolves respond.

He has never been one to let tragedy or setbacks slow him down. In 1989, he and his future wife, D.D. Alexander, were passengers on a United Airlines flight that crash-landed in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111 people on board. The couple survived, and Matz heroically plucked four children — three siblings and an 11-month-old baby — from the wreckage.
Survivors include a brother, Leonard M. Schultz of Hattiesburg, Miss., and nieces and nephews.
"From the outset, we knew the competition for Race to the Top grants would be intense, and that most states would not be funded in the first phase.

In 18 games last September, Montero hit .328 with four homers and 12 RBI, hardly intimidated after joining the Yankees as they clinched the American League East. Nor did he shy away from the bright lights of the postseason, knocking in a run while collecting a pair of hits and an RBI in his two plate appearances.
"We played much better the second half, and we fought back really well," he said. "We just have to mentally get a little tougher at times. We're young, and that is something we'll just have to do."
For example, she knows of employers who wanted to bring jobs to the state, but wanted to tap into programs aimed at training workers to fill the new jobs. In states with more coordinated efforts, she said, this would be a one-stop process, where bringing jobs, training workers and filling openings would be done in conjunction with state and local entities.
Since Christie took office in January 2010, spending on subsidized child care has declined $42 million, Zalkind said. Some of those savings are expected to be realized by imposing an electronic attendance system that pays for only children who attend school every day.

Also, I knew that I was a storyteller and I wanted to tell stories through a variety of mediums.
Angela Meleca, a spokeswoman for Senate President Tom Niehaus, said the majority-party Republican caucus is "fully committed" to holding hearings on what is sent over from the House.

Oldman's castmates here are the crème de la crème of U.K. thespianism: Colin Firth as Bill Hadon, a bicycle-commuting top deputy; Ciarán Hinds, as Roy Bland, another upper-management MI6 chap; David Dencik as Toby Esterhase, likewise a possible suspect as the double agent. Also here are John Hurt, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch (in this weekend's War Horse, as well, and here given the role of Smiley's aide) . . . it's a very male world, this 1970s spy game.

Nugent and the band then ran through a short cover of "Red House," which owed more to Stevie Ray Vaughan than the original Hendrix version, with layers of flashy blue guitar working over the slow burning tune. "Live It Up" and "Hey Baby" followed, which Nugent called "Motown classics," while the big riff of "Motor City Madhouse" earned the kind of cheers reserved only for the classics.

Because here at Vulcan, there's only me and Bert Kolde, who sits with me at games, and I've known since college days, and has been the vice chairman of the Blazers for forever, so it's just me and Bert here, there are no other people.

UO (13-5, 1-2 Pac-12) scored just six runs in three games at Washington while batting .159 (17 of 107) for the series. This against one of the worst teams in the conference last year at 17-37.
A report by Zanotti and other volunteers actually recommended higher salaries for some posts, such as $215,000 for the information officer and $174,000 for the law director, in order to lure top-notch managers. So it makes sense that FitzGerald's administrators cost more.
Some say medical liability caps may have legal problems of their own. Oregon's constitution does not allow capping damages to lawsuits unless the defendant is a public entity.

Such a sensibility — fluid, visionary, risky — marks the 11 pieces in "Woolgathering" (New Directions: 80 pp., $18.95), a collection of impressionistic prose poems that dances at the edge of memoir before opting for something harder to pin down. Originally published in 1992 as part of the series of small books ("3 by 4 inches in size," Smith recalls, "like a tiny Indian prayer book that one could carry in one's pocket") released during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the delightfully idiosyncratic Hanuman Books, it has just been reissued, in a slightly expanded edition, and to read it again is to be reminded of just how interesting Smith can be. This is no sequel to the National Book Award-winning "Just Kids," which traced her early years in New York with Robert Mapplethorpe. Rather, it is both wilder and more reflective, a portrait of Smith's inner life, beginning in childhood and stretching into the undefined and ever-present now.
"We needed a fightback and a fightback is under way," Cameron said in a somber televised statement outside his Downing Street office after a meeting of the nation's crisis committee.

But with the Nuggets throwing an array of double teams at Bynum, he diverted his focus. Though he finished with only 10 points on five-of-10 shooting, Bynum played a key part in the Lakers' disciplined defense. His 13 rebounds and a playoff career-high 10 blocks cast him in Lakers lore -- surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Lakers playoff record of nine blocks in 1977 against Golden State -- cemented a triple double and tied an NBA playoff record for most blocks. Bynum shut off looks in the lane, helping Ramon Sessions switching on pick-and-rolls and quickly rushing back on defense. In turn, Pau Gasol (13 points, eight boards) and Jordan Hill (10 points, 10 rebounds) became trusty options when Bynum wasn't open.
The remainder of my stint in the sports department brought more of the same, culminating with a front-page story on dinner with a "swinging" bachelor golfer.

Roberts announced this week that 10 schools will be authorized to make most of their own decisions, each under the supervision of a strong principal and a five-member advisory board.

“If we can find that support through another measure that is more within our control in the operation budget and gets to the same end goal, I think...we should reconsider,” he said.
Worse, many Republicans recognize that their cantankerousness over their choices makes things worse. It's a vicious cycle. As George Orwell once wrote: "A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks." A bad candidate can win with enthusiastic voters and a good candidate can lose with unenthusiastic ones. But a bad candidate with unenthusiastic voters is like a submarine with screen doors: a guaranteed wreck.

I also built a chicken coop and bought two hens. You can have as many as three hens in Clackamas County. It's great to get a farm-fresh egg almost every day.

After graduating with a degree in communications from Boston University, Lewis launched Elephant Journal in 2002, a print magazine centering on things yoga, things spiritual, things green.

Waimea Plantation Cottages: I love history and preservation and here is an example you can sleep in. The cottages are former plantation houses from around Kauai that have been hauled to a coconut palm grove next to an ashen sand beach on the southwest end of Kauai. The early 20th century, Craftsman-bungalow-style plantation buildings have been lovingly restored and filled with Hawaiiana. Each comes with a kitchen. What the cottages lack in modern luxury is more than made up for the chance to experience life in a bit of history. Nowhere else in the islands do I feel so attuned with the aloha spirit of Hawaii.

Now it's time to get behind our new representatives to make the longed-for cultural change a reality.
Duyck called for more involvement by women on county boards and commissions.

Second, this is a step that needs to be taken. Oregon's boom-and-bust tax structure is broken, condemning the state to a destructive cycle of building up programs and institutions in good times, only to tear them down in bad. Repealing the corporate kicker should be part of the solution.

I was very young at the time, and I just remember stories of the liquor carts on the airplanes running out of booze with Mama Jo leading the charge. … It's a little sad for me.

A: I probably met with a little over 90 percent of the police department. It's the only time we've ever done it. We had to do it in 13 different meetings at Qualcomm Stadium. I got a lot of feedback from the officers. They're as embarrassed and angry as I was. And the feedback was how do we move forward as an organization, as a family? They want to provide the best service they possibly can. They very much wanted me to know that the actions that took place with a very small number of officers should not reflect on the entire organization, because they're proud of who they are and what they do. And they clearly understand that their badge has been tarnished. How we move forward is everything to them.

European high-yield companies this year have issued a total of $27.5 billion in bonds as of April 11, according to data provider Dealogic.

I could list more than 100 different job titles and, like many of us, know nothing about them. But there is one job title I do know something about: firefighter. I was a professional firefighter in a local suburban fire department for nearly 16 years. During that time period, I traded shifts with other fellow firefighters in order to advance my education. Although there was no specific policy, rule or order in place, there was a very clear understanding: If someone did not get paid his time back with equal time worked (no cash was ever part of the trades), the fire chief would not allow any further trades to take place, in the whole department! That put each and every firefighter on notice; be fair to your fellow firefighters, and be fair to the administration of the fire department. As a result of this manner of administrating "time trades," we policed ourselves with honesty and integrity.

Dry vernal habitats are sanctuaries for survival, concealing astounding diversity, innovation and adaptation. Some bees living near vernal pools live solitary lives. In spring, each female digs natal chambers, like spokes on a wheel, and in each chamber places one egg on one ball of pollen. Next spring, a tiny, furry adult bee emerges and mates just in time to pollinate its particular choice of flower, dig chambers, make pollen balls and start the cycle again.
