It's a blood-soaked movie about comeuppance and rage that, in these mad-as-hell days, has struck a chord with film-festival audiences.

Roden is eyeing the customers from a Starbucks tucked inside a grocery store in the same plaza, employees who work in the surrounding businesses and the high school students across the street who have an open campus.

But then the noise factor doesn't encourage lingering. On my last visit to Cleo, on a weekday night, I might add, the noise level was so high I could carry on a conversation only with the person next to me, not across the table. And so, after dinner, my group ended up talking for a while on the sidewalk outside. For many, the noise factor at Cleo will be a deal-breaker unless you opt for an early dinner. Or a late one.

Other elements of Summer Jam felt familiar, too. Brooklyn emcee Fabolous coasted through a slicker, tamer version of the same rap-rock set he did last year. Banks lit up New Meadowlands Stadium in 2010 with the money-flashing anthem "Beamer, Benz or Bentley"; in 2011, the song was once again his highlight. Chris Brown’s roughneck R&B set was a paler version of Trey Songz’s smoldering turn last June.
"After the X-ray I heard her speak into a walkie-talkie and say, 'OK, she's clear'," she told me. "I started toward the bin to retrieve my belongings, only to have the TSA agent block my path and say, 'Where do you think you're going? I'm not done with you yet.'"

The more pressing question now is what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere who are already here. Some Republicans want to redouble efforts to deport them; Mitt Romney has said he hopes they will "self-deport." But such fantasies of a mass exodus are as unrealistic as the demand for a vacuum-sealed border. The Obama administration is already detaining and deporting a record number of immigrants - nearly 400,000 annually. Besides, a real exodus would leave some sectors of the domestic economy struggling. Right now, more than half of all farmworkers in the U.S. are here illegally. Deporting them won't push Americans into the fields. Just ask farmers in Alabama and other states that have enacted draconian measures who have found their crops rotting in the field because of labor shortages.
I was partially right: The chef's veal shank was near perfection, gently roasted to melting shreds in a tomatoey veal reduction. Crisply fried leaves of spinach took on a springlike freshness. Yet all my attention focused on the watery landslide of rice, cooked to a literal mush, underneath. I was so taken aback, I gummed three mouthfuls before I halfheartedly tried the veal. Then I awaited our server.

Dan Wetzel, Yahoo! Sports: "Brady is a competitor. He's a worker. For all his fame and fortune now, he's a self-made quarterback, no one's glamour boy when this all started. The three Super Bowl wins in his first four years as a starter may have made him think, at least a bit, that the fairy tale always turns out true. These last seven seasons, the first loss to the Giants, the knee injury in 2008, the various playoff disappointments and now this, have changed everything. Who knows when the opportunity comes again? Brady is 34. Windows always close faster than anyone anticipates. Can he ever get title No. 4? Can he ever get past Eli Manning?"

The Women’s team now has earned a break, and will resume training in preparation for the 2012 London Olympics in late October.

It was not always thus. Five-year transportation bills had traditionally cruised through both chambers, but they hit a roadblock in 2009 amid disagreements over whether to supplement or raise the gas tax, which is no longer sufficient to meet the country's infrastructure and maintenance needs. Since then, Congress has been passing short-term extensions of the 2005 bill. But the current gridlock goes way beyond the gas tax. It arises because lawmakers have agreed not to include earmarks, which in times past drew members of both parties together for the sake of collecting some pork for their home districts, and also because the Republican-controlled House is being steered by a tea-party-backed coalition that would rather throw ideological bombs than make laws or run the government.

Can our leaders reform and reauthorize the No Child Left Behind law?

Can the protagonists of the debt ceiling brawl lay down their gloves and accomplish anything of importance? The Senate and White House offer more glimmers of hope than the House.

It's a romantic spot for late-night rendezvous. Perch on the edge of the boxy, cushy chairs, order a drink and settle in. The bar has an easy elegance that encourages friendliness, so it won't be long before someone nearby offers to buy a drink (if you're a pretty woman) or makes small talk (if you're a friendly man).

Bresee said that a variety of factors may have contributed to the mild, late flu season. First, this year's viruses are similar to last year's, which means many people already have some immunity to the strains. Vaccine coverage is improving. The warm weather, too, could help keep flu infections at bay. Flu viruses remain viable longer in colder weather, he said, and people are less likely to "cluster inside," which can promote disease transmission.

Even if they were perfect, one wonders what a British Yorkshire pudding-like treat stuffed with French cheese doing in an "American" brasserie?

Or whether it's a French culinary aristocrat's stereotypical assumption that American equals "international" or deep-fried.

Should the best-of-seven series go to a fifth game at Vancouver’s Rogers Arena, there would be three days between Games 4 and 5. That is probably because of other events in both buildings, highlighting the difficulty of finding open dates in arenas like Staples Center that are in near-constant use.
“From the time I first met him, I knew this was a special young man,’’ said Riley. “He was a caring soul.’’
While President Obama was phoning Fluke to thank her for supporting his policy, advertisers were dropping their ads on Limbaugh’s show — even after his lame apology. Within days, and even after his mea culpa in his comments to media outlets, many advertisers had fled and the mouthy host finally was back behind his microphone with an inadequate apology to Fluke.

That's largely because the current estimate of cougar numbers in Oregon (5,700) is just that: an estimate.
Worst of all, this so-called mandate relief package includes one provision that would drive taxes up, not down. It gives upstate and suburban school boards more leeway to jack up spending when voters reject their budgets - pretty well defeating the whole purpose of those annual referendums. Given that New Yorkers already pay some of the highest property taxes in the country, that's the opposite of reform.
Small wonder that even drivers who know better are tempted to sneak a peek at the BlackBerry or hunt for a new audio book on the iPod.

Each team in the junior and senior divisions plays about 11 games each season, which runs from March through June. Placentia won the 2011 championship, a feat considering they have happily referred to themselves as the "Bad News Bears."
But some in the community aren't too sure about the project, concerned about the increased traffic and upset by the lack of information. Councilwoman Peggy Lehmann said she wants to wait until she hears comments at a public hearing on the project on March 27 before the council's final vote.
Tucker acknowledged that other factors played a role in the district's recent success, not just outsourcing. These include the economic rebound, which has boosted tax revenue and investment income, and higher gas prices, which have pushed more people to public transportation. "I don't disagree that some things have gone our way that have improved our circumstances," he said. "I don't hang my hat just on the privatization of buses."

They don’t spend frivolously on material things because they know how expensive it is to care for someone with autism. Beth cites an article that put the lifetime cost of caring for an autistic child at $3 million, versus something like $280,000 for a normally developing child. Statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate parents with autistic children spend about $4,000-$6,000 more per year.
Cutler's toughness and will to win were persecuted nationwide. Not necessarily by fans or media, although salvos were flung from those camps too. More stinging to Cutler's image were the assaults he received from peers.
Plans for the school have been around for years, though it has never been built. The city approved a conditional-use permit for the school in 2005. An assembly center and ball fields that could be used by the city during after-school hours must be built on the land. Plans call for a 45-room school with a student body capped at 1,200 pupils.

Yes, Frank Gore was dinged up, battling an ankle injury in the Week 10 meeting on Nov. 13, but he played in the first half and was held to zero yards on six carries. A closer look shows that even a healthy Gore could have been challenged with how the Giants were sniffing out the run and stuffing run plays in the backfield. The 49ers had more success running the football in the second half with Kendall Hunter and Anthony Dixon — they finished with 77 rushing yards as Michael Boley was sidelined in the second half with a hamstring injury. Gore will be healthy today, but the Giants have been stingy against the run lately and should draw some confidence from their performance back in Week 10.
The measures are being touted as "tweaks" to the Missouri nonpartisan court plan, adopted by voters in 1940 in reaction to the political hacks placed on the bench by Kansas City's notorious Pendergast political machine.
Women should have their first cervical cancer screening at age 21 (instead of age 18 under previous guidelines), and they don't need the test every year, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

WASHINGTON -- Bad wiring and a leak in what's supposed to be a "blowout preventer." Sealing problems that may have allowed a methane eruption. Even a dead battery, of all things.
I never once read in any book or heard any professor in the high school explain the basic principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the individual; that the government had no right to do anything that each and every individual did not have a right to do. Instead, they had to teach that the government or the local school district, if the majority so willed, had a right to force a Catholic parent or a childless person or an old maid or an old bachelor to help pay for government schools...

Buffett rule. President Obama is making this a centerpiece of his campaign. Originally proposed by Warren Buffett himself, this rule holds that Buffett should pay more taxes than his secretary. And, more to the point, Mitt Romney should pay more than the 13.9% he paid on his 2010 income of $21.6 million. Specifically, Obama proposes a minimum tax of 30% on all incomes over $1 million.

That risk, after nearly five years, looks like it’s paid off more for the city than the man who took it. Newark has benefited from hundreds of jobs and, according to the Devils, more than $200 million pumped into the economy. But numbers can’t explain the impact of the building.
Stephens: This is a hit for Mr. Miss, Newt Gingrich, who says that yes, he's going to withdraw from the race. We don't know exactly on what timetable. He's building the suspense. But I think on the whole, we deserve to--we ought to be thanking Newt. He made this race interesting, he made it sometimes exciting. Sometimes he made it a real race, he sharpened Mitt Romney's performance, and above all, he made it very entertaining. So thank you, Newt Gingrich.

There are multiple wild cards, however, including Ron Paul, the 76-year-old Texas congressman who has worked for months to build a strong organization here and enjoys a passionate following. He is sometimes marginalized because of a quirky demeanor and unconventional foreign policy, but he has run a strong second to Romney in the New Hampshire polls for much of the year.
I had trouble visualizing the size of a 1-acre park, but it is about one-fourth of City Hall Park. The proposed Central Park should be a good spot for walking, to hang out with a book during your lunch hour or to let the kids work off a bit of steam on the playground. And with two multi-level parking structures, there should actually be enough convenient parking for visitors to the park and complex.

--Walking goes after belly fat. Been wondering whether strength training or aerobics (brisk walking, biking, swimming, dance classes) is better for flattening abdominal fat? The jury's in and the answer is aerobics. Strength training is great for building muscle and sharpening balance (that's one reason we recommend doing 10 or 15 minutes of it three times per week). But aerobics is the stuff that busts up abdominal fat -- the deep, risky, "visceral" belly fat that raises your risk for diabetes, heart disease and ever-larger pants.

Still, that's an overall decline in the percentages, which is always good news. However, I also know that some mistakes go undetected and therefore uncorrected. Sometimes that's because journalists and readers alike simply don't know the mistake is there. That's frustrating to me  but it's even worse when I speak to a reader who tells me he noted an error in the past but didn't point it out at the time, dismissing it as too trivial or not wanting to make the effort to reach out.
By the way, whoever runs the Trail Blazers Inc., Twitter account saw the Allen shot at me and immediately retweeted it to the team's 75,000-plus followers. This is as viral as it gets around here. Some who saw it laughed. Some shook their heads. Some weren't sure what to do. One guy tweeted out, "Fight! Fight! Fight!" Others, savvy with computers, rummaged around Allen's personal website and found his mother's booklist for him, some of his sister's stuff, and a random smattering of Allen's videos and photographs.

Winning in a good way against Denver clearly involves Bynum and Gasol as the focal point. It'll help minimize the Nuggets running its league-leading 104.12 points averaged in total offense. It'll help the Lakers absorb Metta World Peace's absence because of a six-game suspension stemming from his elbowing last week on Oklahoma City's James Harden. It'll likely make the Nuggets' relentless effort on flooding the post a lost cause.
Buffett's Omaha-based Berkshire owns roughly 80 subsidiaries, including railroad, clothing, furniture and jewelry firms, but its insurance and utility businesses typically account for more than half of the company's net income.

Much of the weakness stems from a spike in gas prices since last year. That reduces the amount of money consumers can spend on discretionary goods, such as furniture, electronics, and appliances. Spending on those categories has fallen for three straight months.
The old management of the Trail Blazers used to complain about the fish bowl. They were woefully ignorant. New management could probably teach a seminar on the wonderful benefits that come with having the focus on you when you’re caught doing the right thing. What we’ve learned from the Blazers and the recent incidents at Oregon and OSU is that Kelly’s program has an opportunity available to it that Riley’s does not.

Thirty-nine Democrats voted "no" on the House bill, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will probably need some of those to switch their votes.

The mayor's office apparently doesn't see it that way, but Ms. Rawlings-Blake's taking back the tickets was juvenile. There were certainly other ways she could have expressed her difference of opinion.
Another change is to downplay the carnage. While director Ross doesn't shrink from the violence, he never glorifies it. Still, the action at parts is heart-racingly intense, there is blood, and it's all too tough for young children. The MPAA ratings board often misses the boat, but this time they're right on target and parents should respect the PG-13 rating.

Former Sen. Rick Santorum has a private plan. With his young daughter fighting a serious illness, he'd have a hard time getting insurance at any price if Obama's reforms were repealed.

Special effects aside, the Illuminati benefits from a heavy pour of Hendrick's Gin, which is infused with cucumber so as to mellow the "Christmas tree" flavor that many find unappealing about gin. With some additional Cointreau and a splash of lemonade with a lime wedge/cucumber-slice garnish, there's a nice balance. The pairing of the cucumber notes and tartness of citrus blends well with the gin to create a nice flavor profile.

Down 2-0 in the second period, Devils killer Kris Versteeg took a sweet feed in the slot from Stephen Weiss and beat Brodeur cleanly at 7:05. It was Versteeg's third goal of the series and he has eight goals and 11 points in 10 games against New Jersey this season.

I am preparing again to teach "The Bible as Literature" at Washington University. In the class, we look at the Bible as itself a profound literary text (or rather, texts), as well as the ways the Bible influences other literary texts as one of the most influential works of western literature.
