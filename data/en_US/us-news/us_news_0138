At ground level, these concerns fuel another trend: developing ways to maintain reasonable quality control now that the end-of-the-line copy desk can no longer process everything. Interviews and visits by AJR make clear that newsrooms are lurching toward new ways, from "buddy editing" (where you ask the nearest person to read behind you) to "back editing" (where copy is edited after posting) to "previewing" (where copy goes to a holding directory for an editor to check before live posting).

10. Multitasking: Pros can eat, drink, change clothes and ride at the same time. But this one really applies to the managers, known as directeurs sportifs, who follow along in the team cars. Their driving is just scary. While driving, they watch a TV monitor showing the race, listen to the official directives on race radio, look at maps, check times, and shout encouragement (often in several languages). They do this on flat open roads and on narrow mountain passes. Outside of the Tour de France, if you tried that you could be cited for driving while distracted.

The Boston Globe found the memoir "a curious work -- both wrenching and enlivening, resonant with candid emotion and yet sometimes episodic," and noted two particular moments that supersede its sorrow: "The first is of Anna proudly attending to her desk at the office, touching the typewriter and piles of carbon paper that gave her life meaning. The second is of Mary the adult visiting her mother in a nursing home -- bringing her cake, and singing to her, long after Anna has forgotten her daughter's name. Such are the memories that allow air and light into a room of so much heartache."

On the importance of hiring a quarterbacks coach, missing in the regime of Josh McDaniels: Absolutely. That's something that was one of the first things Jeff and I talked about. It's something I believe in. The quarterback needs to be taught, no different than anybody else. I have a way that I belive it should be done.

Blunt — of course — brushes aside those sorts of accolades, but her work in two new films certainly required her to turn on the charm. This weekend, she stars with Jason Segel in "The Five-Year Engagement" as an ambitious graduate student whose education derails her wedding to her docile, unfocused fiancé. In Shelton's ultra-low budget independent film, out in June, she plays a young woman who falls for her emotionally compromised best friend (played by Mark Duplass) but can't decide whether to come clean about her feelings.

About the Blazers: The Blazers saw the momentum from an impressive stretch of eight wins in 11 games — multiple coming against Western Conference playoff contenders — obliterated in a hideous 108-87 loss to the Golden State Warriors Tuesday night at the Rose Garden. ... Coach Nate McMillan said afterward that it was "one of those games where you burn the tape and move on. " At Wednesday's practice, staying true to that statement, McMillan said he did not watch film of the game. ... Even with the loss, the Blazers qualified for the playoffs for the third consecutive season and 29th time in franchise history because Houston also lost. ... Starting center Marcus Camby did not travel with the team to Utah because of a neck strain he suffered in the first quarter of Tuesday's loss and his status for Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Lakers is unknown. ... The Blazers are one of two teams in the NBA that feature six players averaging at least 12.0 points per game. If that holds over the final four games of the regular season, it would be just the fourth time in franchise history that has occurred.

One sketch has him arriving at his office letter box, to find it labeled, "The Most Lost of the Lost."

For all his money, Rockefeller had a frugal streak, according to my guide, Brenda. He decorated the house with second-hand furniture, she told me, although he also was never without dimes in his pockets to hand out to local children.

Caro's earlier volumes have been controversial, massive and masterful. In 1974, Caro changed the craft of biography in the United States with "The Power Broker," a book of more than 1,000 pages about Robert Moses, the powerful New York City urban planner. Despite Moses' relative obscurity outside of New York, the book won awards, sold well for years and altered the way publishers dealt with the craft of biography. Suddenly, long books about less than internationally known subjects became more attractive to publish. Suddenly, obscure journalists (Caro was a relatively youthful newspaper reporter at the time) gained credibility as biographers, wresting the craft away from Ph.D. historians.

Hats off, brava, take a deep bow, chef Lucy Ferreira: This is your day to shine. Ferreira, who works her magic in the kitchen of Mojito, a Cuban restaurant just off the old Bayway Circle in Elizabeth, is classically trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and London.

Economy: Term marked by high unemployment, a deep recession that began in previous administration and officially ended within six months, and gradual recovery with persistently high jobless rates. Unemployment rate jumped to 8.3 percent from 7.8 percent in February 2009, Obama's first full month in office, and has remained above 8 percent ever since.

The first step in carving is to remove the wings and the legs, clearing a path to the breast meat. The wings go first -- make a 45-degree slice at the joint and you can usually cut right through it. Remove the legs by grabbing the knee and pressing it down, away from the carcass. This will expose the hip joint, which you can pop out using the tip of the knife, then simply cut the leg free at the base.

Stoudemire's defensive play on the potential buzzer-beater was praised, as was Iman Shumpert's pressure on a potential handoff to Johnson, which Woodson said was the key to the last play."

Order with an aim toward counterbalance. In this case, we opted for the avocado curry, which is more yellow than bright green like the excellent avocado curry dish at Chada Thai on Broadway.

New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan is in town this weekend, spending time with his personable brother Jim, a St. Louis attorney. Rex is fortunate that the Rams didn't hire him before the 2009 season. The Blues are expecting a visit from Rex at this morning's practice. The Blues have developed quite a following among sports personalities. Carpenter, David Freese, Matt Holliday, Danny Amendola, poker professional Dennis Phillips and broadcaster Joe Buck are among the notable regulars at home games.

Some skeptics will dismiss Jackson's effort by pointing out that he has a legal obligation to operate in the black. True, but so does almost every mayor and governor in America, and as the Great Recession and its sluggish recovery move into a fourth year, many of those executives are being forced to wield axes.
Additional seniors who Urban is counting heavily on include Tyler Brown (back), Andrew Harris (back), Mohamad Heyari (forward), Danny Luebbert (midfielder), Taylor Overstreet (midfielder) and Jesse Dunigans (utility).

The lottery's cruelest turn for the Suns came in 2007 when they were going to get Atlanta's pick to complete a trade as long as the lottery did not put Atlanta in the top three, where the pick was protected from the 2005 Joe Johnson trade.

A: Your oranges were exceptionally pithy this last season because of the extremes in our weather. The conditions that limit growth -- such as extreme heat, especially right after the spring bloom -- can affect the amount and quality of the fruit. Fruit cells enlarge during favorable warmth, but during extremes, they are stunted, and the protective skin increases for protection.

William F. Reed, SI.com: "Most of the credit -- or blame -- for our collective madness belongs to Adolph Rupp, who won 876 games and four NCAA titles at UK from 1930-'72. More than Henry Iba or Joe Lapchick or any other coach from the 1940s and '50s, Rupp invented overemphasis in college hoops, and his legacy to UK fans is the superiority complex they display to this day, much to the consternation of U of L fans and many others in college hoops. The first five of Rupp's successors -- Joe B. Hall, Eddie Sutton, Pitino, Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie -- all tried to tame the beast in one way or another. But John Calipari is different. He feeds the flames and fans them, talking about something mystical he calls ‘The Kentucky Effect,' which embodies everything to do with the lust for winning that makes UK the perfect place for a coach who likes to demagogue it up a bit. Calipari and UK were made for each other. Calipari freely admits that he's running an NBA prep school for one-and-done superstars. This is just fine with those in Big Blue Nation, who have long regarded academics as mostly a nuisance.

In the end, coach Jim Tressel, the only one of the 29 who will once again take the field at Ohio Stadium, told them he'd never had a class like this. Saturday would not end with the national championship they hoped for at the start of the season, or even with the Rose Bowl they held out hope for at the start of the day. Penn State beat Michigan State to share the conference title and earn the Rose Bowl bid on a head-to-head tiebreaker.

Critics argue that "unelected bureaucrats" shouldn't have so much influence over Medicare, but bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services already have more power, including the authority to exclude treatments and deny coverage. Congress, meanwhile, can make systemic changes in Medicare, but lawmakers abandoned the last major effort to slow spending growth in the face of special-interest pressure.
Q: I wish you would have added a question on another subject.
Take the proposed nanny-state farm-worker regulation withdrawn (but not killed) by the Labor Department last month. It would have prohibited workers 16 or under from using powered equipment (which would seem to cover even battery-powered screwdrivers) unless working on a parent’s farm. Isn’t that the rule today? No. The proposal would have required the farm to be “wholly owned” by parents, thus letting the rule apply to the many farms owned in partnership with brothers, sisters or other relatives.

Explanation and confession. I love seeing "Brokeback" sentimentality lampooned because I'm a sentimentalist at heart and, baby, I know I need to be held in check when it comes to this film. I'm besotted with the thing. I think it's a great epic, and I believe it's made a difference. True, "Brokeback Mountain" has yet to top $100 million in revenue. As a recent USA Today article points out, more people tune in to a single episode of "Dancing With the Stars" than have seen "Brokeback" since its opening. But pooh on that; it's still the movie of the year. It's invaded America through the (broke) back door (heh) to become a viral phenomenon and a media darling. Oprah has embraced it with her all-powerful arms. Even Howard Stern went on air Feb. 7 to call it "an incredibly moving movie," adding, "I wish that they would take this movie and force these a -- from the religious right (to see it) ... these Taliban mother -- who want to sit there and tell gay people they can't get married."

The 5-foot-9 Nagbe won the Hermann Trophy as the nation's best mens college player in the country after helping the Zips win the national championship last season. He scored seven goals and had 13 assists during his junior season at Akron. For the Whitecaps, with just one forward currently on the roster and a stated desire to add more attacking players, drafting Nagbe would seem like a no-brainer.

"When Richard was nominated ... I said he's highly qualified. He will do an excellent job," DeWine said today. DeWine said he declined to sign on to the NAAG letter not because his support had waivered but because, as a former member of Congress, he is reluctant to write to his former colleagues to tell them what to do. (He made an exception, he said, when he wrote to Congress about the Asian carp threat to Lake Erie.)

To operate effectively, bullies need people to have some other objective than exposing them: avoiding the bully's wrath, say, or preserving the appearance of normalcy, or covering one's own culpability, or enjoying a shared enemy's takedown.

You couldn't do it with a different filmmaker, because he's the one who's tweaking. He's the one who's watching. He'll come in, and he'll just whisper something quietly to one of us -- either of us, or both of us. We'll start and we'll shape it and it changes. The first take is usually completely different from the last.

These days, though, parents and students alike aren't only stressed about how they're going to pay for college. They want to know what the student should be doing now to make sure they can afford to pay the bills after college. Our friend Tom, whose son Jesse recently graduated from high school, puts it this way: "Once you could say, 'Study to be a doctor or a lawyer,' and you knew they had a pretty good chance of making a comfortable living one day. Not any more."
“It did,” Flyers forward Max Talbot said when asked if defense won the game. “That’s definitely what helped us win this game. Bryz was great tonight and defensively I think we were solid.

Hey, Tony: I read this comment in an ESPN article: "A lot of coaches out there don't know how to win. They think it's more about their systems when it really is about what their players can do. They're more concerned with stats or showing people how smart they are." Does this help to explain why McCoy looked sharper and the offense looked competent during the first weeks of the preseason? Why is it that the more coaching the offense has received, the worse they have become? -- David King, Joelton, Tenn.

The study did not weigh the consequences of some of the heavy meat-eaters’ other habits, which could be as big a problem as the contents of their plates. If raising fork to mouth counts as exercise, then yes, a shorter life expectancy will likely be the outcome. If you are eating red meat every day, in large quantities, accompanied by fried fixins’, no fresh veggies and always from the couch, fewer years on earth may follow the gluttony.

The statement was a reference to the Republican budget approved by the House of Representatives last month that Harris and all but 10 other Republicans supported. The plan, which has no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate, would not eliminate Medicare but would fundamentally transform the program into a system in which seniors would receive subsidies that they could choose where to spend.
The scandal has prompted the resignation and subsequent arrest of Brooks and the resignation of Wall Street Journal publisher Les Hinton, sunk Murdoch's dream of taking full control of lucrative satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting and raised questions about his ability to keep control of his global media empire.

I was always drawing. I started drawing when I was just a kid and my mother gave me old children's books so I could see what people drew. Before that I was always trying to draw horses.

In this otherwise overlooked corner of Canada, you won't find plush accommodations or provocative cuisine. The typical B&B experience is a spare room in someone's basement.

I don’t read the future, but I guarantee to you there’s gonna be more cheers than boos in those 10 years.

Farris said he is asked about Ohio State's situation constantly, but he has never reconsidered his decision. But the news about Price can't be a complete surprise. Price had appeared to waver at times after his oral commitment. Assuming he's the only player Ohio State loses in this class -- with linebackers Curtis Grant (Virginia) and Conner Crowell (Maryland), longsnapper Bryce Haynes (Georgia), receiver Evan Spencer (Illinois) and offensive lineman Brian Bobek (Illinois) the other out-of-staters yet in the fold -- the Buckeyes wouldn't have too much to lament.

If a heart attack isn't enough to get a person's attention, what about cancer? You can probably guess by now. In a 2008 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Canadian investigators examined the lifestyles of more than 9,000 cancer survivors and found that only a few had made the switch to a healthful lifestyle. Although most had given up smoking, fewer than 20% were consuming five servings of fruits and vegetables a day and less than half were engaging in regular physical activity. Only 1 out of every 20 survivors was following all three principles of healthful living.
The Indians already had a great trip in hand, but they wanted to go out with a bang.

Only a few generations ago, such a conflation of religion and right-wing economics would never fly in America. Whether William Jennings Bryan's "Cross of Gold" crusade or the the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s poor people's campaign, religion and political activism used to meet squarely on the left - where they naturally should.
"It's a worthy goal," said Chris Tennill, spokesman for Clayton schools. "It has forced us to thoughtfully consider how we're reaching and teaching our students.

It's going to be that 100 percent of your school districts are failing."

Neither frequent-flier miles nor people improve with age, so burning off any surplus miles you might have is a good way to cut the financial bite out of a Joan trip. Obviously, you don't have to blow as many miles as I did. An outlay of 50,000 miles will take a couple most places in the United States and to nearby Canadian, Caribbean and Mexican spots, 120,000 miles will get a couple to Europe. Sure, it's hard to score low-mileage-level seats, but be flexible about time and specific destination and go when your airline (or a partner line) has seats.

Across the state, sales of new and previously owned homes fell 28.3 percent from November 2009, the Ohio Association of Realtors said Wednesday. The trade group attributed that decline, at least in part, to unusual sales patterns caused by a tax-credit offer for home buyers. A federal income tax credit originally was set to expire in November 2009, prompting a rush of home sales toward the end of last year. Congress later extended the credit into the early months of 2010.
