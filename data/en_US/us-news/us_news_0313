But when designers Dora Brigham and Sally Taylor were approached by a couple who own an expansive two-story home in Nellie Gail Ranch in Laguna Hills, the master suite was where it all had to begin.

A quick glance at the final regular-season statistics indicate the 49ers’ pass defense is average in today’s NFL. The 49ers finished 16th against the pass, having allowed 230.9 yards per game during the regular season. Against the league’s most prolific throwers, the Niners can be exploited. Last week, Drew Brees threw for 462 yards and four touchdowns. It was the third time this season the 49ers allowed more than 400 yards passing — and the sixth game in which an opposing quarterback accumulated more than 300 yards. One of those 300-yard passers was Eli Manning, who threw for 311 against the 49ers in Week 10, completing his first 10 passes before cooling off. Much like the Packers, the Niners rely on forcing turnovers — they led the NFL in turnover margin — to offset their deficiencies on defense, a risky strategy for any defense. Ask Green Bay.

Meanwhile, there's a chance to win the top spot in the Western Conference. Vancouver's come-from-behind win last night will make it tougher, but the opportunity still exists. On top of the team's priority list the final three games, however, should be getting its game back in order and finding more chemistry among the players who have recently returned.

We get the attraction of thongs and cold beer, but for the pure love of plump pelicans, sugar white sand and blue water, it's very hard to beat the Tampa Bay area. We're so good that Dr. Beach's list of America's best beaches had to retire two of them so the rest of the country can stand a chance.

The Journal found tracking files that collect sensitive health and financial data. On Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.'s dictionary website Merriam-Webster.com, one tracking file from Healthline Networks Inc., an ad network, scans the page a user is viewing and targets ads related to what it sees there. So, for example, a person looking up depression-related words could see Healthline ads for depression treatments on that page—and on subsequent pages viewed on other sites.
If only the squirrels liked the seeds more, but they don't, so many elm trees pop up throughout the year. There is no product labeled to stop the fall flowering and seed production so you have to deal with the seeds. You might try preventing their germination in shrub and flower beds with a preemergence herbicide that is applied to established plantings and found at garden centers. Even with this extra help you are probably going to be removing lots of seedlings.

2. Those "jokes" in her cookbooks: In the season three finale, some lines in her latest cookbook raised hackles with the Manzo clan. Among them, that Caroline Manzo is as Italian as the Olive Garden, a joke she made many months earlier during a meatball showdown on "The Rachael Ray Show." That bit of trash talk was actually suggested to her by one of the show staffers. She says no one objected to the joke until the book came out. She also says she only objected to Chris Manzo's adult car wash idea in the sense that she wouldn't want her daughters to work there.

Use common sense when accessing viral content through social media. When a large volume of content is available around a news story from many sources, the spread of malware and viruses also increases. If you see a story or photo on a social network that seems suspicious or too unbelievable to be true, trust your gut. If you want to be sure, Google the story and access it directly from a reputable source instead of clicking through via a social network.

The Orioles lead the AL with a 2.83 team ERA that has been spearheaded by a pair of revelations. Taiwanese left-hander Wei-Yin Chen, signed to a three-year, $11.3 million deal this offseason out of Japan in a move that flew almost completely under the radar, is 2-0 with a 2.22 ERA in four starts. He gets the call tonight.
Thus, it strikes me that the conventional wisdom may have it backwards. Social media is actually the effect of the 4.74 degrees separating you and me, rather than its cause.
Whether fans were aware of it at the time or not, they also witnessed a moment in Ohio sports history that has been forgotten and misreported. A powerful and quick 145-pound senior from John Adams named Ludie Graddy beat Euclid's Bill Murphy, 4-3, in the championship match. Graddy is believed to be Ohio's first black state wrestling champ, which in a sport that embraces a rich history, has been largely overlooked.

McG, auteur of the Charlie's Angels films, is not blessed with finesse. He amps up the decibel level and, whenever possible, films his characters in vehicles that exceed not just the speed limit but engine capacity. The result is a calculated date movie that aims low but provides the basic movie pleasure of seeing good-looking people looking good.

He's not there yet. But he's headed there. How can we tell? He's not afraid to create. Nor is he averse to risk. And most important, he sees failure as something positive.

Indeed, Stanley Baron, in his book Brewed in America (Little, Brown, 1962), cites a 1771 recipe for "Pompion Ale" that appeared in the papers of the American Philosophical Society.

The recipe's author warns, however, that the pumpkins impart a "twang" that some might find unpleasant.
"When you get the adrenaline going it is something that you can get through," Craig said. "It was something some thing that you can't keep up over the course of a long season.

Obviously, I could play and play well, but the point of it was I couldn't have a long career and there were questions marks if I could last an entire season playing every day.

Walk a few blocks up the hill from the Manhattan Beach Pier on Manhattan Beach Boulevard, pass Noah's Bagels on your right, and look left. That's Metlox, a sun-splashed semi-minimalist collection of shops and restaurants that's too genteel to call a mall. (The median household income in Manhattan Beach is more than $100,000, which makes it the wealthiest of the three beach-city neighbors.) There's sushi over here, Mediterranean food over there, plus a spa and Le Pain Quotidien bakery. And there's the Shade Hotel (1221 N. Valley Drive). It opened in 2005 (the Zislis Group again), and if you're wealthy enough to pay (it's $295 nightly in winter, $395 in summer), it's the coolest lodging in the South Bay. Its public areas are handsome and modern (except that the upstairs pool is too small for anything but a quick splash), and the guest rooms have spa jets in their two-person tubs, along with retracting screens between the bathroom and bedroom areas. If you're not quite wealthy enough — and if you're antsy about easy airport access — the Belamar Hotel (3501 Sepulveda Blvd.) might make sense. Though it has the feel of a business lodging (with boutique flourishes), it's less than two miles from the beach, connected to downtown Manhattan Beach by the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt footpath and less than four miles from LAX, with nightly rates that start around $180.

Though tradition once dictated the flat, round coupe being the Champagne glass of choice, it's now widely accepted that the tall, tapered flute best displays the wine's bubbly nature.

One of the country's most popular playwrights, Rebeck has been on fire lately. She penned the hit lit comedy "Seminar," which ran on Broadway starring Alan Rickman. She masterminded (and then exited) NBC's sudsy backstage drama "Smash." She debuted "Dead Accounts" at the Cincinnati Playhouse. Oh, and did we mention she also wrote a breezy showbiz tale known as "The Understudy," soon to make its West Coast bow at San Jose Rep?
This tantalizing bit goes nowhere, though: The second-half revelation -- a staple of reunion stories -- isn't about Tom's sexuality but the team's missing fifth man. Like every other plot point, it fizzles out. This isn't "The Big Chill" but "The Big Pill."
The Health Resources and Services Administration is overreaching and interpreting the law in a way that restricts the use of the information much more than the law specifies, said Sen.

You fly to Maui, take to your hotel bed nice and early, and ask for a wake-up call around 2:30 a.m. Then, even though this is a balmy Hawaiian island, you bundle up and drive up the slope of the dead volcano that dominates the island's geography. Or catch a tour bus; many make the trip every day. However you go, you'll need to reach the summit observation area of Haleakala National Park a few minutes before dawn.

A: There are people who seem to get these juicy parts, so you think of them as great actors — and they are — but I think there are a lot of other people who could be equally as fabulous and don’t get the chance. It’s really about who gets the shots. I’ve been really lucky. If you get a really good director, a really good part, great actors around you, then people recognize that you’re capable of doing really good things, and they come back to you. But, I mean, there are at least five actresses who could have played my part here. They probably would have done it differently, but they could have done it.

Kona Village future still uncertain: While visiting the Pacific Tsunami Museum in Hilo this month, I saw a small exhibit on the damage done by the March 2011 tsunami from Japan that hit the Kona side of the Big Island. It focused on the heavily damaged Kona Village Resort. I talked with officials last summer about the prognosis for repairs, and they expected the resort would be closed until at least the middle of 2013.

I'm interested in animals in zoos. Their relationships with their captors and keepers seems so intimate, it's a resonant and richly suggestive situation. I remembered seeing a picture of a tiger wandering a residential street; later, I read about a man who kept a tiger named "Ming" as a pet in his Harlem apartment. I've always loved elephants—I saw them everywhere in India, where I returned regularly as a child. Animal characters freed me to be inventive. Not writing about recognizable human characters, I could invent dramatic situations, be wild and free in the writing. Writing about animals was a way to try to do that.

Other than any scheduled private workout, it will be all or nothing for Blackmon's 40 time at Oklahoma State's pro day March 9. That's less than two weeks away.

Van Peebles, who corralled iconic filmmaking dad Melvin and other family members for bits and cameos, doesn't let a tight budget restrict his freewheeling editing tricks and cast-wrangling energy.

So here is how today's America's medical system helped me reduce my cholesterol: My physician green lights me to take a natural statin the federal government does not bother to regulate. He throws in some other suggestions like flax seed, fish oil and more cardio workouts. My in-laws, who abhor modern medicine and have no actual medical training but do subscribe to an alternative medicine newsletter, convince me that two red yeast rice capsules are about right and that I should also take something called CoQ10. I do all that for six months, take another blood test, review my lab results online, find out my cholesterol has dropped 40 points, read an encouraging email from my doctor but don't schedule a follow-up visit and so never talk to him, and decide I should stop taking one of the two natural statin pills because, in my medical opinion, it's best to not take medicine unless absolutely necessary.

So WHO is this nice and forgiving? Most grownups, I think, reflecting guiltily on my own imperfection. I hope that I also can simply accept an apology and move on with life.
Oregon's win over Stanford was slightly more impressive to me than Ohio State's win over Miami. And though Oregon gave up nearly 600 yards of offense against Arizona State, I thought Oregon didn't have a game when the Ducks struggled to the extent that Ohio State did against Illinois. To me, the schedules are pretty similar so far, and overall, after this weekend, I though Oregon's overall body of work was better.

Hey, Mary Kay: If Peyton Manning signs with Tennessee, what level of interest would the Browns have in Matt Hasselbeck? Yes, I know he's older than most NFL starters, yet his knowledge of Holmgren/WCO would be perfect!

And as I remember, he lit up our defense last year with quite a few beautiful passes! -- Eric Dobson, Austintown

Fans of the film will remember that Michael and Appollonia were married kneeling in the doorway of this plain stone-fronted church, which, now that I'm standing here, seems like an odd choice. Perhaps the light inside was bad for shooting (cameras, not guns). We take some pictures, then follow the same path down the hill into town that the newlyweds did, realizing about halfway down that because coastal Savoca was standing in for inland Corleone, the camera crew wasn't allowed to shoot its good side.

While Klinsmann hasn't committed to Herc or Wondo, he has gone all in with Shea. Although the 22-year-old hasn't played to the level he showed last summer, when he emerged as an MLS MVP candidate, Shea has been a mainstay for Klinsmann and clearly offers qualities the coach appreciates. His ability to stretch defenses along the flank is a valuable asset, and Klinsmann has invested considerable time in bringing the player along.
After a discouraging record in the 2011 FEI Nations' Cup series in Europe, the U.S. was relegated to the Promotional League. The Wellington feature, while not part of the top series, has special meaning because it's the USA's only Nations' Cup and is played on home turf before a capacity crowd that has cheering sections for several of the 10 nations represented.

Baldwin-Shirey said the campus began to soar academically following districtwide technology upgrades funded by the voter-approved 2008 Measure A construction bond. In addition, her staff has aggressively sought state and federal technology grants. Over the past three years, the school has added dozens of laptops, iMacs, LCD monitors, digital cameras, sound systems and other equipment. Teachers often use the equipment to record DVDs or CDs of lessons they can then pass out to students who missed class.

The Palmer report would seem tailor-made to facilitate compromise language. It reportedly states that Israel has a legal right to conduct a naval blockade of Gaza, and stop suspect ships. But it also reportedly criticizes Israel sharply for the conduct of the raid and unnecessary use of force.
The oil and gas crowd, like any other taxpayer, has every right to lobby. But some GOP objectors to Kasich's plan seem to say that fairly taxing a potential Ohio oil-and-gas drilling boom would be like strangling Steve Jobs or Bill Gates at birth -- the "spirit of enterprise," and all that.

Interestingly, though they may diametrically disagree with the court’s rulings, Republicans and Democrats appear to be nearing a consensus on their diminishing support of its actions. After the highly polarizingGeorge W.

And despite the presidency being held by a Democrat with two Supreme Court appointments under his belt, Republican approval is greater than Democratic approval.

In the end, the parts of "The Aviator" I found most appealing had little to do with fact and everything to do with fiction, especially his enchanting airplane ride over Beverly Hills with Katharine Hepburn. If not exactly educational, it was certainly diverting, and at times beguiling. Based on my understanding of Hughes, this was the least factual of the pictures I saw. It is also the most likely to win Oscars, I'm told, and I have to think there's a connection between the heavy doses of fantasy and resulting nominations.

The second example is the tantrum Beijing threw in October after Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Liu was vilified as a subversive and a criminal merely for writing a manifesto calling for democracy in China. The leaders of a country touted as the next superpower depicted a frail and sick man whom they had already imprisoned as a dire threat. But there was more. Beijing warned the Norwegian government -- which does not decide who gets Nobel Prizes -- that its relationship with China could be damaged. And it initiated a campaign, which is ongoing, to browbeat European governments into boycotting the December ceremony in Oslo at which Liu will be honored.

Over half a century, Clark made millions -- making his first million by the time he was 30 -- as a producer or executive producer, shepherding projects onto the airwaves that even he acknowledged were more diverting than ennobling: awards shows like the Golden Globes, the Academy of Country Music Awards and the American Music Awards; shows like "TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes," featuring collections of clips; and TV movie biographies and dramas that targeted devotees of camp, kitsch or B-list celebrities. He said, "What is wrong with giving people what they want, what they enjoy?"

Mike Freeman, CBSSports.com: "We don't know and it's premature to speculate what effect football may have had on his emotional state. But I have a feeling this won't be the last time we talk about Seau in the context of what football does to the human mind. Most people, for now, are going to say this: they didn't see this coming. The guy that was always happy and cracking jokes . . . didn't see it. Maybe someone who knew Seau's secrets will say something different, but it seems unlikely. For now, for right now -- I'll remember his jokes. And that gigantic smile that never seemed to stop."

And for brewers, who like beers that require little time to ferment and condition, lagering, or aging, doppelbocks is slow going, which means they're costly to produce. Consecrator from Bell's Brewery, for instance, needs a good three months in a fermenting vessel to soften up the beer's hotness.

With Adam Schefter reporting on ESPN that the Browns aren't trying to trade Colt McCoy, the scuttlebutt of the last two days can perhaps be calmed down for at least a few days. McCoy's status is certainly tenuous, but NFL teams don't generally act in knee-jerk fashion -- so any decision is likely a few days, weeks or months away.
In Knotts' hands, Fife was a fully realized stooge, a hick-town Don Quixote who imagined himself braver, more sophisticated and more competent than he actually was. His utter lack of self-control led him into desperate jams that usually culminated with Fife at the end of his rope, bug-eyed and panting with anxiety. Sheriff Taylor allowed his deputy to carry just one bullet, which he was obliged to keep separate from his service revolver due to past trigger mishaps.

Living as he does with a DIY decorator, Glenn Hoffinger, aka "The Hulk," is the superhero of husbands. He never complains when he comes home to find furniture missing. Or doesn't say a peep to the crazy quilt of color samples painted on a wall.

But when it comes to his TV and the rest of his electronics, a side of Glenn appears that few have ever seen.
With PNC Field in Scranton about to be demolished and undergoing a $43.3 million facelift, Empire State is playing all of its 2012 games on the road. Since Sunday’s game was scheduled to be played at 2,600 capacity Dwyer Stadium in Batavia (N.Y.) Rochester offered its home stadium, Frontier Field, with a standing-room-only capacity of 13,500. In order to do that Rochester first had to get a host of permissions and then had to move its scheduled game against Buffalo Sunday to a Saturday doubleheader.
What sets Gialina pizza apart is the handmade crust, with puffy edges that are darkened but not blistered and a delicately chewy texture - it's nearly cracker-crisp on the outside, giving way to that elusive tender breadiness. The secret, according to Ardiana, is a low yeast-to-flour ratio and a dough that is wetter than most. She also makes the dough the night before so it has time to proof.
"I don't put any pressure on myself like that," he said. "As for this being a contract year, I try not to think about that. If I start thinking about it, then you put too much pressure on yourself to be loose and do what you've been doing for so long."

"I thought the break was good for him, because I had been playing him a lot of minutes, too, probably more than you want," Lakers coach Mike Brown said.

But one day, Lucy had to make a stop on the way to pick up a prescription before the drugstore closed. Hidden behind huge sunglasses, she still couldn't hide her embarrassment at having bad hair in public, and so had her QuirkOut moment: She leaned in and whispered to the pharmacist, "I'm on my way to get my hair done; I usually look really cute." He looked at her prescription for Prozac, smiled and wished her good luck.

Claiming to be "the first certified, sustainable sushi restaurant in the world"-- every piece of fish has an unchallengeable ecological pedigree -- Bamboo Sushi is also stunningly good, with inspirations that could come from only the deepest seas. Kristofor Lofgren and sushi chef Brandon Hill have devised a set of tongue-tingling Signature Rolls, such as a Lucky 13 that invokes albacore, cucumber, avocado, Dungeness and raw scallop, and have an eye on the market that can produce a four-nigiri salmon sushi flight: king, coho, Copper River and Tasmanian trout.

The beauty of Web 2.0, Stein said, is more than the success stories. Just as important, the new economics have "lowered the cost of failing," he said. "Five years ago it would have taken $10 or $15 million to determine if you had a business. Most start-ups are ultimately unsuccessful. By lowering the cost of failure, now a team can tell for $2 or $3 million whether or not it's pointed in the right direction."

The problem is, as gifted as Ferrell is as a sketch comedian and in over-the-top roles such as Ron Burgundy and Ricky Bobby, he doesn't possess the acting range to pull off a character as nuanced as Nick. Or as nuanced as he should be. There's a fine line between downplaying and somnambulance.

Most upside: Asa Jackson. Admittedly, I knew absolutely nothing about this Cal Poly cornerback -- the third FCS player the Ravens drafted Saturday -- when his name flashed up on the bottom line in the fifth round. But now that I’ve done a little digging, I like what I have learned. He has decent size and speed for the position, but he excelled in man-to-man coverage at Cal Poly, having not allowed a touchdown in man-to-man during his final three seasons there. Jackson has a lot of talent to pass up on the team’s stacked cornerback depth chart, but he might just be their next Lardarius Webb.

What's incontestable, though, is that Thursday's House session was the first since the Zanesville-area wild-animal release and shootings. No one on Capitol Square needs to hold marathon committee hearings. What's to know? Ohio does a crummy job policing private zoos. Ohio needs to do a better job.
REVIEW The Kids Are All Right
Their age and size stats notwithstanding, Columbia was ready for the fight. The Eagles gave the champs all they could handle, starting with a standout performance by junior goaltender Kevin Shreckenberg.
Izzo said he was beginning to see better decision-making from Appling on the break. Appling, a sophomore point guard, doesn't always attack now. He is better at pulling the ball back out when necessary.
Johnson said the museum's volunteers have about six months to find a new location or a place to store its collection until a museum site can be found.
The interior was changed completely by Erin Martin, who gutted the light walls and finished floors right down to the concrete. Dark wood slats now cover the walls, and the door openings are trimmed in black metal. About the only element recognizable from before is the open kitchen.

Four years ago, during the height of the real estate bubble, one (non-Tahoe) ski resort marketing head told me: "We're essentially a real estate company with a hill attached. The skiing is almost an afterthought to us now." Tracts of new multimillion-dollar homes, lavish resort villages, and hotels fell onto the hills like an El Niño snowfall. Now that the real estate market has tanked, the resorts are refocusing their efforts on the ski experience. The following are some of the results for this season.

That process started during drought of the early 1990s, when San Diego leaders feared getting shorted precious supplies and pledged never again to be so tied to "Mother Met." New sources eroded Metropolitan's control over water imports and fractured the relationship between San Diego and the rest of the region because of concerns that the water authority was essentially going into competition with Southern California's largest supplier.
"There is no question that that is so stark when you actually see it and you’re here," he said in an interview. "I was somebody who felt that way politically before I came here, but now that I’ve actually seen the sights it’s reinforced my opinion that the place has never been better or freer than under Israeli control."
On Saturday, Sen. Rob Portman floated an even smaller plan, said a lawmaker directly familiar with the panel's work. It, too, was rejected. The lawmaker required anonymity because of the secrecy of the talks.
When the doors open for the 9:30 English-language service, the lines don't budge.

Speaking of Jackie and Ari, Secret Service man Clint Hill has his own two cents on that marriage in his new book, "Mrs. Kennedy and Me." Clint was the one who leapt onto the trunk of President Kennedy's car seconds after the shooting, assisting the bloody and terrified first lady.

"Then the parents should give the kid cover."
Gordon: "Clint (Bowyer) and I are friends. I have a lot of respect for him; he is a great race car driver. I'm glad I talked to him before I talked to you guys (the media). I was pretty mad at him. He said he got hit from behind from the No. 39. I heard that from my team as well. I didn't get the best restart. When he first shoved his nose down there I thought ‘ok we will make it work', but when he came through there with so much speed there was no way. I had nowhere to go; Jimmie (Johnson) had nowhere to go. It is pretty unfortunate. I didn't want to see that last caution. We had such a great battle with the No. 48. He is so tough here. To be able to get up beside of him, I had to rough him up a little bit. I felt like I had the position to get the lead. Our car was pretty good on entry, his car was better on exit. It was going to be an interesting race. That's just the way our year has been going. It can't go like this forever. We are just going to keep working, keep bringing race cars like that Drive To End Hunger Chevrolet right there and we will be fine."

He said his attorney assured him the case would be thrown out; when it became clear that wouldn't happen, Holm said, his lawyer advised him to waive his right to a jury trial.

Ryan said the confusion stemmed from a sideline conversation between himself, offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer and quarterbacks coach Matt Cavanaugh.

Northfield Park relies on simulcast racing to stay afloat.

How do you volunteer in your kids' school? Currently, I wear different hats as a volunteer within my children's school. Once a week I volunteer in both of my children's classrooms. My son, Jarred, is in fifth grade. In his classroom, I work with a reading group; we sit out in the hallway, read and discuss our book. Currently, we are reading "Million Dollar Throw," by Mike Lupica. My daughter, Rachel, is in third grade. In her classroom, my tasks vary; I work one-on-one with students who may have struggled on a homework assignment, grade papers, help with computer lessons, read to students, make photocopies, assemble packets to be sent home with students. In general, whatever her teacher needs help with, that is what I am there for. She has a stack for me when I arrive in the classroom.

Coach Payton said that he met with his top two defensive assistants, Coach Williams and Coach Vitt, in advance of the interview with league investigators and told them, "Let's make sure our ducks are in a row." Remarkably, Coach Payton claimed that he never inquired of Coach Williams and Coach Vitt as to what happened in the interviews, never asked them if a "pay-for-performance" or bounty program was in fact in place, and never gave any instructions to discontinue such a program.

øSome private lenders are advertising student loan rates as low as 3%, which makes them look like an attractive alternative to Stafford loans with a 6.8% rate.
