My petite filet of beef ($30), for instance, was delicious, tender enough to cut through with a butter knife and pan-seared to a medium-well perfection (cringe if you must, but this is how I like it – and rarely get it). But the accompaniments are what took it to another level.

Executives and directors across the market have been cashing out stock at a fast clip. "The pace and volume of insider sales hit a four-year high during Q4 '10," reported InsiderScore, a firm that tracks such data.

This bill does attempt to compress programs and trim red tape, but a five-year authorization -- once the norm -- would have helped.

Sides are standouts too. I happily could have had the applewood bacon and abalone risotto as a main course. Few chefs can turn out a risotto this perfectly cooked. And yet the components are entirely original — big, tender cubes of abalone and half-inch cuts of bacon.
Diving is not allowed in the protected marine park, but government-licensed boat captains and guides offer snorkeling tours for about $90 per person. Tours typically last four to six hours, allowing snorkelers to enter the water in pairs several times for whale-shark rendezvous.

But you don't have to be the chairman of the board to be an accomplished self-promoter. And Misny knows the value of publicity. He agreed, and the video was shot at the Agora. It was recently posted on YouTube and is getting plenty of hits, but the rap world doesn't have much to fear. The video, with his TV commercial language and even his 1-800 number, comes off like one long commercial.

"I'm really enjoying it, believe it or not," he said. "I probably don't show it. I'm enjoying the interaction with the coaches, I'm enjoying working with the players, I enjoy the process.

So I sat on a stool and looked at the camera and talked about how my NCAA basketball bracket was only worthy of lining a bird cage and that I never do good at picking winners in any sport because apparently I have a brain defect that prevents me from predicting correctly.

Cunningham finally got Alexander to go out and see the movie - "We enjoyed it," Cunningham said - but nothing else seems to be able to distract Alexander, the WBC 140-pound champ, as he prepares to fight Timothy Bradley, the WBO 140-pound champ, on Saturday at the Pontiac Silverdome in a battle of young, talented, unbeaten fighters. Regardless of how the fight goes, the winner will be on the fast track to the upper echelons of boxing and the loser will have earned the boxing world's respect for taking a chance.

In the right hands, AutoTune software can enhance the personality of a pop singer. Consider Kanye West’s groundbreaking work on "808s and Heartbreak" or T-Pain’s playful "Chopped and Screwed." This is the computer as an instrument of the producer’s whims; software as a playground for a digital provocateur.

As Rep. Upton continues to ignore risks and facts in his push to move the tar sands pipeline forward, what's legitimately helpful for his constituents goes unaddressed. For Michigan and the nation, approval of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline would be a dirty and dangerous step backward.
The Suns stormed back with four runs in the bottom half with a lot of help from Lexington starter Kyle Hallock, who never made it out of the inning.
At the same time, the definition of "family entertainment" seems to be rapidly evolving. Anybody who's been in a multiplex lately knows that many parents have been taking their preteen children to see grown-up fare like "Transformers: Dark of the Moon," rated PG-13 for "sci-fi action violence, mayhem and destruction and for language, some sexuality and innuendo."
Commissioner David Stern is clinging to the feel-good Jeremy Lin story, rushing him into All-Star weekend because he has little else.

This theme of parental difficulty in getting satisfactory responses from those in authority positions in schools is one of “Bully’s” constant refrains.

• If the address was not in one of those three cities – and 60 of the county's 109 enumeration districts were not – then it gets trickier. Go to http://www.archives.gov/research/search/ and in the search box type "1940 census orange california" (without the quote marks). That will bring up links to the original maps. Warning: They are hard to read.
When they're blooming and yellow, they are glorious. And since they're endangered in my neighborhood, if I starting killing them, kids would have nowhere else to test their lungs by blowing away an entire ball of seeds. Nowhere else to make dandelion necklaces, to test whether they like butter, to taste the bitter leaves. And where else would they be able to play the most violent kids game in history (including "Grand Theft Auto")?

Paul Scott, vice president of the San Francisco based Plug In America, said "the market is quite robust" for lightweight commuter vehicles like the Triac.

Horton, whose role on Cards telecasts on Fox Sports Midwest has been expanded to about 100 games this season, will be called on if he is available. If not, Claiborne will be the replacement. As has been the case, Shannon is expected to have about 15 days off during the season, Rooney about five.

Here's a story I assume is true, although maybe it's an urban legend that appeals to people like me who want to believe it. If you've watched TV at all in the last 25 years, you probably saw the antacid commercials in which a voice-over asks, "How do you spell 'relief'?"; then the on-camera spokesperson proclaims, "R-O-L-A-I-D-S!"
The bus ride was a gorgeous, relaxing climb through colorful rock canyons that looked like a more remote Sedona or Bryce Canyon. I held my breath as I turned on my camera for the first time in two days after dropping it in a shaft of ice water on the Perito Moreno glacier. To my relief, the camera had dried out and would chronicle our two remaining weeks.
"I'm innocent and it's proven... I would never — never — put my daughter in a tanning booth. We go out shopping. That's what we do," she told TMZ. "Any mother that makes an accusation about me is not a mother, because I'm a great mother and I would never do that to my child."
The three states were among nine in the 1990s that tried to force insurers to sell policies to anyone who asked, regardless of health, without also mandating that other residents maintain coverage.

Fans of "Friday Night Lights" who've waited all year for the episodes that first aired on DirecTV to get to NBC will be disappointed this Friday. KSDK is at it again, preempting the scheduled episode for a local special. Seeing "Friday Night Lights" will require recording it at 12:30 a.m. Monday (late Sunday). DVRs set for a series recording should pick "FNL" up automatically, but given the possibility for a baseball overrun earlier Sunday, it never hurts to add more time. (You can do that with a DVR either via recording options or, more easily, by recording the show that follows.)

Early in their 20-year marriage, Mr. Ford, a 61-year-old retired social-studies teacher, began to feel his wife didn't fully reciprocate his affection. She rarely initiated hugs and kisses. And while she let him hold her hand sometimes, Mr. Ford says he could tell she didn't really enjoy it. He began to pull away. "I didn't want to waste my time," he recalls. "If the marriage isn't working so well, I can go fish or hunt or work on my studies or business relationships." He worried the relationship wouldn't last.
Yes, unions would rather wait out Bloomberg’s remaining 23 months than give up anything. But the mayor can play harder ball, threatening layoffs and even privatization in some areas unless they play.
Fitting the Ravens: The cornerback position is likely to be a low priority in the 2012 draft. Lardarius Webb looks like a budding star, Cary Williams surprised as a first-time starter and Jimmy Smith showed promise as the team’s first-round draft choice in 2011. Domonique Foxworth and Chris Carr are potential cap casualties, but the Ravens still have Chykie Brown, who will be in his second season, and Danny Gorrer on the roster. Maybe in the later rounds.

"So often, all people really need is a fresh eye," explains Kempf. "You know how it is -- you often just stop really seeing your living space because it's so familiar. Sometimes, just suggesting a new paint color or a different way to group artwork or photographs makes all the difference in the world."

If the truth be known, most women I know also dread the supermarket experience. Why else would we bargain away our choice chick flick just for the company. But, someone in the household has to be the modern day hunter/gatherer when the cupboards are bare. I try to shop the sales and only go every two weeks.

In "The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches From the Front Lines," Mann tells the infuriating tale of what else scientific notoriety has brought. He and prominent climate science colleagues have received threats to themselves and their families, harassing lawsuits, illegal subpoenas from Republicans in Congress, and vilification across the right-wing media and blogger spectrum. They have seen their work lied about, distorted and willfully mischaracterized in a disinformation campaign orchestrated and financed by a few ultra-conservative right-wing billionaires.

As an interim superintendent, Tarantino is only allowed to serve for two years in Greenwich Township, which he will reach at the end of this school year.

Perhaps she has spent some time reading Virgil in Jerusalem College's library. The Roman poet didn't sweat the distinction between the mind and reality either. In his epic, when Aeneas sees his dead father and others in the underworld, the word the poet uses to describe them is "animae" — usually translated as "souls" or "shades." Some Latin dictionaries stretch the word so that it also means "memory," which leads to a poignant conclusion.

American plankers are new to the game. An Australian planking website cropped up in 2009, its associated Facebook page now "liked" by 500,535 people on Facebook. While the term "planking" is believed to have originated in Australia, the practice was originally called The Lying Down Game, or Extreme Lying Down, which began in England. Its Facebook page describes the activity as "parkour, for those who can't be (bothered)." Though both planking and parkour -- the practice traveling through an improvised obstacle-course -- make use of street landscapes, parkour requires running and jumping. Once in position, planking involves no movement.

Such related-party transactions are common in the Illinois nursing home industry, often to increase efficiencies.
It's good to hear that Raskind is planning two meetings this month with members of the community. He should listen carefully to what residents have to say. But with the board planning to vote on cuts as early as April 5, that's not much time for community input. Clevelanders who want to be heard need to jump at Raskind's invitations.

In the hushed cabin far above the Atlantic, I thought: No, sir. I can think of nothing better than to walk along an unfamiliar coast with the person I've known longer than any other, sharing a physical trial that becomes a bond, traveling light so there's no room for grudges, giving ourselves time to walk off minor irritations and ambling ever closer to a relationship that wouldn't have been possible 20 or even 10 years ago, when I, at least, was sure I had all the time in the world.

"Though Romney has tended to adapt some positions to different times and places, he is hardly unique. It should be possible for a politician to say, "I was wrong, and I have changed my mind," the paper wrote.

Consider the energy issue. The report takes the bold step of identifying the security risks of energy dependence, as well as arguing that reducing nonrenewable energy use by the Department of Defense is essential to bolstering national security. But the document doesn't set any goals or establish new policies to meet this need. Should military fossil-fuel use be reduced by 5 percent? By 10 percent? By when and how?

The real trick is getting tourists like us (read: wine fanatics) into these public art spaces, museums, galleries and art-filled wineries. Many established nonprofit institutions, including the Napa Valley Museum in Yountville and the Di Rosa Preserve in the town of Napa, are regular stops for locals and schoolchildren. But they receive only a small part of the more than 4.5 million annual regional visitors. (The museum's average annual attendance is 12,000.)

At the same time – let me repeat – there is still half a schedule to play. The Blues could beat the Canucks tonight and a week from now, they could be six points behind them in the standings.

What's cool: Blue mustard's leaves are edible, like those of many other species of wild mustards (most of them have yellow flowers). Just be sure you've correctly identified the plant and that it hasn't been sprayed with herbicides. "The flavor is reminiscent of radish though usually not with as strong a flavor as the cultivated radish," according to Wild Utah Edibles (wildutahedibles.com). You could add a few leaves to a mesclun or dandelion salad along with some lamb's quarters or purslane.

Federal contractors employ tens of millions of Americans to build everything from roads and dams to missiles and satellites.

Last month, I stopped in the city to check out a few new hotels. I was on my way home from a long trip to Southeast Asia, where I had stayed in a room at a guesthouse near the Thai-Cambodian border that cost $15 a night and came with a frog. It made for an interesting comparison with the places I sampled in New York, where the average rate is $250 and rising. ("If you wanted a really great bargain," Hennessey said, "you should have visited in 2009.") Rooms in the city have Vichy showers and 400-thread-count sheets — but no wildlife.

But in the end, her powerful voice blew away such concerns. As her first hit single, "Jesus, Take the Wheel" gave way to a reading of the gospel song "How Great Thou Art," Underwood bent her back and sang toward the ceiling.

But if you were to take the Clayton High School faculty and move them en masse to Vashon High School, Vashon would not turn into Clayton. All the graduates would not magically start going to college.

Even the best teachers can only do so much.

Eliminating the pickup is a popular reform bandied about by many these days.

In what Prime Minister Donald Tusk described as "the most bitter victory" of his life, Poland's lower house of parliament agreed to gradually raise the retirement age to 67, despite opposition from trade unionists. Tusk had warned of a "catastrophe" if Poland failed to pass what he said was a necessary bill to secure pensions for future retirees. Studies have forecast a shortage of workers by 2040, when most of the population will be older than 50. The bill is expected to pass in the upper house before it is signed into law.

Butera's new role
Commanders at the front, such as French and Douglas Haig, and politicians and propagandists at home, such as Rudyard Kipling, saw the war through the joint lens of sport and empire. British commanders in the First World War — French and Haig are Hochschild's primary cases — were shaped by the battles to enlarge and defend the British Empire, especially the Boer War. The fantasy of an "abiding, benevolent British Empire" lay at the center of their lives. They held fast to the idea of the cavalry as the primary weapon of war, completely in denial that "war was now an industrial process." Despite lessons from the American Civil War and the Russo-Japanese War, British commanders and strategists failed to understand how the machine gun, poison gas and barbed wire had changed the face of war and had made individual skill nearly irrelevant.

For more than 25 years, this tiny cafe has been a popular stop for tourists and locals because of its internationally focused menu and wine list that features particularly good Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon selections. Seared duck breast is paired with a warm apricot compote and savory black forbidden rice; and salmon gets an all-American twist with smashed red potatoes, roasted corn and red pepper relish and grilled eggplant. And of course you can get a hamburger anytime; vegetarian options include a vegetable risotto. It's served up in a dining room that looks vaguely like an ice cream parlor, what with the black-and-white floor, red ceiling and white marble tables on heavy metal bases.
It was disappointing to read your Sunday column criticizing Judge Donna Miller. My job was to reconstruct and determine the causal factors in serious and fatal vehicle crashes. That resulted in testifying for the prosecutor before various judges and understanding their operations and demeanors.
Yet even this single step toward reform faces fierce opposition from both the left and right ends of the political spectrum. It looks unlikely to pass Congress, and that's too bad.
News channels from North America to Europe and the Middle East carried live coverage. Pope Benedict XVI said in Spanish that he "continues with hope to entrust to God's goodness" the fate of the men.

Even if Otto were not a good judicial administrator, the proper recourse would be for the court's leadership to remove him from his administrative position, not for voters to remove him from the bench and deprive the court of a valuable jurist.
While not the only inner-ring suburb attempting to address 21st-century housing issues, South Euclid is aggressively approaching the problem with the goal of fixing the homes using "green" technology, and giving the homes universal layouts in which owners can comfortably transition from young to old.

øI once found myself under a lot of stress from the pressures of parenting, business ownership and community involvement. I had recurring stomach ulcers and bouts with migraines.
When I raised my hand to take the oath of office then, I could not say with confidence that the State would meet its payroll within two months. Imagine that, New Jersey unable to meet its payroll. That was the gravity of the mess we were left to deal with due to the mismanagement which reigned in this town before our arrival. Our deficit for that fiscal year, already more than half over, was more than two billion dollars. The budget problems for the next year, fiscal year 2011, was a record deficit of $11 billion.
The next month, a Hennepin County judge ordered that Jessich be committed to treatment for chemical dependency and mental illness because she was a "danger to herself."
Opponents of Senate Bill 5 say the measure is nothing more than a full assault on unions. It's difficult to interpret it any other way.
That law makes it a state crime for an illegal immigrant to work, penalizes employers who hire them and encourages local authorities to turn over illegal immigrants to federal authorities, among other measures. An appellate court has blocked provisions that require immigrants carry visa documents and allow police broad leeway to question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.
You can cook it, of course, the lower and slower the better. But surprisingly, one of the most popular ways to use kale these days is in salads. Though kale leaves have always been found on almost every salad bar, it wasn't for reasons of edibility — it was for decoration, because this was one green so tough it would last forever without wilting.
Meanwhile, Gentz showed up at the Grosse Pointe Park police station Wednesday afternoon, but left less than 10 minutes later without speaking to the news media.
NOACA, and similar agencies in Akron and Youngstown are concerned that a private operator would not maintain the turnpike as well as it is maintained now.
It would be, well, premature to say the reputation of the Browns in the Mike Holmgren regime as quarterback gurus has been proven. (Yeah, "premature" works. It's a much nicer word than "ludicrous" in the wake of the Jake Delhomme signing and then the Colt McCoy experiment, when the front office failed to surround him with playmakers).
One tool is the state's findings-for-recovery database, which was launched in 2004 to track money owed because of misspending in schools, cities and other branches of government. Anyone who winds up on the list can't be awarded a state contract until the money is paid back or otherwise accounted for. But employment contracts, such as for a school treasurer, aren't covered.

The increases to fuel efficiency for the Cruze are in all versions of the car with automatic transmissions and the 1.4-liter turbocharged engine. The Cruze Eco, a version of the car that gets 42 mpg highway, uses a manual transmission, so GM does not expect its ratings to change. Also staying unchanged is the Cruze LS, the base model version of the car that uses a 1.8-liter engine mated to a manual transmission.

I tracked the kitchen's business by how many pans May used. His dishes required one for meat, one for garnish, and, occasionally, a third for couscous. At 8 p.m., he was blowing through his 40 pans every 10 minutes or so, which meant the dishwasher had to keep running up the stairs from the basement sink to fetch the enormous bucket where Giovanni threw his dirty pans, still sizzling from the heat of the roaring oven.
A year ago, Superior Court Judge Stephan Hansbury, sitting in Morristown, dismissed the suit.
Arizona State - Now that Osweiler is with the Broncos, the candidates to replace him are Michael Bercovici, Taylor Kelly and Michael Eubank. Under new coach Todd Graham, the Sun Devils will be more ground-oriented (and no doubt far more disciplined) than they were under Dennis Erickson.

The Higbee project is Key's first attempt to build flexible workspace from scratch. The bank, based in Cleveland, has allowed employees to work from home for years. But the new offices are tailored to floating employees, who can plug in at 172 shared desks called touchdown stations, stow their belongings in lockers or slip into private "huddle rooms" for a phone call or a two-person meeting.
That's because Fowler and her fifth-grade classmates at Worthen Elementary School have been using the community garden as an outdoor classroom.

Between the West Shore and Donner Summit there are seven track systems where skinny skis reign. Trails are machine groomed for three kinds of action: classic cross country, in which legs move scissors-like in a kick-and-glide motion as the skis slide in parallel groves or "tracks"; skate-skiing, which mimics in-line skating using Apolo Ohno - style strides to zoom along trails groomed 6 feet wide and velvety smooth; and snowshoeing, a sport so quickly catching fire that the Nordic centers have rebranded themselves "cross-country and snowshoe centers" to promote their new rental equipment and snowshoe-specific trails.

The ownership of Countryside changed a year ago. One of the movie's most compelling documents is a 1975 report on Section 8 housing done by the Citizens Advisory Committee of St. Louis County.
More than anybody else, my strong, religious and quiet-spoken father, Wallace Holsendolph, was my inspiration. An uneducated man by today's standards, my father set his own course. By example he taught steadiness and dependability, staying married to my mother Ethel for 60 years. And mom, she taught resourcefulness. Working as a housekeeper at the old Hotel Cleveland by day, and taking seamstress classes at John Hay High School at night, she learned to sew well enough to clothe my three younger sisters. And help make ends meet.

O'Brien, who had threatened not to offer health insurance rather than offer birth control coverage, chose to remain silent on Obama's proposal. But the president appeared to have made progress, winning over the Catholic hospital association and Catholic Charities – although not the nation's bishops – and reassuring wavering Democrats while keeping the support of groups such as Planned Parenthood.
øThompson signed autographs, while Lewis strolled toward the green and said she didn't "see any of her 18th hole. I just saw that she had a tap-in to win."
Poundstone says that to help keep her comedy fresh, she keeps a notebook with her to jot down funny things she encounters. That method also keeps her shows from feeling scripted.

I suspect the only way anything will ever get fixed is if we make airlines pay for every single one of those misplaced bags. And I'm not talking about some wishy-washy international treaty that lets them off the hook for everything but lost luggage. I mean rules with real teeth that say to the airlines: If you force us to pay $25 to check a bag, and something happens to it when it's in your care, you are responsible.

Sprint started selling the iPhone in October, after AT&T and Verizon.

Another proposal would be to elect two members countywide.

I have to say though, some of my favorites have been your unsolicited advice you've doled out to celebrities. I'm pretty sure Lindsay had no idea she had a drug problem until you brought it to her attention, and I honestly thought Tori might literally "go away" as you requested. I'm not sure where, but your letter gave us all hope. And I'm also sure Ryan Gosling keeps your note with the marriage proposal tucked under his pillow at night. It was, after all, quite moving.
