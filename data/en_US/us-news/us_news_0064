There are pockets of hope. In Minnesota, resistance to building a new stadium for the Vikings has been fierce _ so much so that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell popped in the other day to deliver a not-so-subtle message. He surely let it be known that he's got Los Angeles on speed dial, ready to send them another team if the Land of a Thousand Lakes won't agree to pay for more than half of a $1 billion stadium that owner Zygi Wilf (estimated net worth: $1.3 billion) just has to have.

The actors do a lot with their small roles, briefly cutting through the movie's off-putting vision of the future (think "The Fifth Element," only gaudier). Their performances are the only things in the film that don't feel processed and sterilized and safe.

It seems that when we're good we're very, very good, and when we're bad we are horrid.
Half of the 75-minute set list was dedicated to the group’s self-titled third release, which came out last year.

When she invited her fans to join her singing they nearly overwhelmed her voice.
The pretty Hampshire village is where Austen was born in the rectory of her father's church in 1775. Like many places that have an early connection with a famous person's life, Steventon has less to offer the fan than hoped. It was the incubator of Austen's talents, but her literary life really started after she left town. The 13th century St. Nicholas church where her father was vicar still stands, though the rectory was torn down in 1828. The church bells are a 1995 gift from the Jane Austen Society of North America. Life in the small village shaped her country-centric attitudes. The Vyne, a great house in nearby Basingstoke that is now maintained by the National Trust, was the scene of the kind of parties that populate her books. Austen's father's decision to retire from the church and move in 1801 to the busy, expensive city of Bath came as culture shock to Austen, then 26. In what may be an apocryphally melodramatic story, Jane is said to have fainted dead away when her father broke what he thought was the happy news.

Sousa-Wright promises to stay active. She's already lost 45 pounds with diet and exercise changes and feels terrific, she says.
The fact that Salinas broke his collarbone on the play likely had a say in how long the suspension would be. So, too, was the identity of the culprit. Let’s face it, commissioner Don Garber has probably reached his tolerance level with Marquez, and the latest transgression was labeled “violent conduct that demonstrated blatant disregard for the safety of his opponent.”
They may promote a cause, such as AIDS relief in Africa. But endorse a candidate? Push a partisan agenda? That could empty half their pews. Few up-and-coming pastors want to risk such a backlash.

Assigning Berkman to the disabled list would free up a spot on the roster to another member of the 40-man. Skip Schumaker had two hits in four at-bats Wednesday night in Class AAA Memphis as he continued his rehab assignment. Matt Adams, the Cardinals' top power prospect at first base, had a .400 average through 50 at-bats for Triple-A Memphis, but he isn't on the 40-man roster and would necessitate multiple unlikely moves to clear way for his promotion.

That's the speed of Google's Internet test network of about 850 homes near Stanford University. At that speed, Web surfers, or pirates, can download a DVD in under a minute or a high-definition Blu-ray in five. The Google Fiber project could foreshadow dramatic changes for Hollywood, which has held up pretty well in the brave new digital world, not least because the speedier network raises the specter of increased piracy.

“Fewer employers are offering the benefit, fewer workers are eligible for it, and fewer workers are taking advantage of the benefit when it is offered, largely due to cost,” said Paul Fronstin, director of the research institute’s health and education program.
The thing is, Ichiro Suzuki might be the most underappreciated great player of his generation. Part of this is he’s been stuck on a losing team most of his career. Part of this is because he’s Japanese; on our field of dreams, we prefer homegrown athletic superstars. Part of this is he’s playing in the Pacific Northwest; many Americans couldn’t locate the Pacific Northwest on a U.S. map, and most Mariners games end about the time Carson Daly is interviewing some indie actress I’ve never heard of.

When you've found a nanny you love, it's important to do some official fact-checking. As you check a nanny's references, you'll want to ask challenging and specific questions. For instance, ask a reference to reveal one bad thing about their experience with the nanny. Find out how often the nanny was unable to come to work. Ask the reference if they've ever checked up on the nanny. To get a sense of a nanny's engagement level for the child she cared for, ask her reference what outings she arranged for the child and if she arranged playdates.

In August 2000, the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the board's ruling.

Langella, to dredge up anecdotes that practically stretch back to Pola Negri, he kept a diary? “No. Absolutely not. I’ve never made one single note. And I don’t like computers. I wrote this longhand. Took a year from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.” How could he reprise so many memories? “Please. I’m an actor. That’s what I do. I memorize. I store things in my head. Total recall. If I saw you 10 years from now, I could recount everything you wore tonight.”
He is on trial in U.S. District Court along with Michael McMichael, a former Cleveland branch manager for Siemens Building Technologies, one of the companies that has done work for CHMA.

At its NBCUniversal subsidiary, the yearlong effort to rebuild the entertainment and news conglomerate appears to be paying off. Cable networks, broadcast TV, films and theme parks reported higher revenue. Cable networks and broadcast TV reported lower cash flow because of investments into new shows.
Serge (Ron Himes), a wealthy dermatologist, has just spent a small fortune on a modern painting: a huge white rectangle. The piece offends Marc (Tim Schall), who considers it the emperor's new painting. The third friend, Yvan (Robert A. Mitchell), is too wrapped up in his own problems - which are legion, mostly involving his upcoming marriage - to care one way or the other. He just wants everyone to get along and give him a break from the demanding women in his life.
“I have to get to the front of the net and be in the right place at the right time,” said No. 10. “This is so important for us. I’m going to do my best.
I've used pornographic images, obscenity and poetry to try to make even the most doubtful blush, but I've never come close to Bachmann's insult to the gentle, honest faithful when she said the suffering and casualties of natural disasters were her God's message to wayward politicians. What she said was disgusting and not generally Christian at all. But her blasphemous message was delivered on the news as just that.
Show Nuggets some love. Come on, you need to have a little faith in our Nuggets. I could see a playoff series with Oklahoma City going to six games. But I think we at least have a shot at beating San Antonio in the first round. While it would be awesome to land Duke guard Austin Rivers or swingman Jeremy Lamb of Connecticut with a draft choice, I really think Denver has the talent to make a deep playoff run.

Just so. At the peak in 2006, "Spain started nearly 800,000 homes -- more than Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom combined," noted a 2009 IMF report. Construction workers represented one in eight jobs (the U.S. figure at the height of the American real estate bubble was one in 18). Even after correcting for normal inflation, Spain's home prices more than doubled from 1995 to 2006.
Merkle said the higher price may surprise some shoppers, but it covers many popular features that are optional on the Cruze's competitors.
"It's a really good opportunity for open discussion," Fackrell said. "There is no set agenda. If something's weighing on your heart, you can talk about it, and no one's going to judge you if it seems outside what you're typically going to discuss at church."
A couple with a stale marriage started its life in my previous film, "Ploy." This is sort of a continuation of that journey. In "Ploy" they just argued, but in "Nymph" the couple decide to take a vacation hoping it might improve their relationship. But the forest has a different idea for them.
Next door loomed five-story Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Wien. MUMOK holds Vienna's premier contemporary art collection, but I found its metallic passageways slightly suffocating. A special exhibit covered the 1960s Vienna Actionists, who favored "direct work with bodies, objects and substances" (i.e., blood, excrement and organs). I zipped through, already unsteadied by feminist rage and postmodern subversions, and it was past suppertime.

And as a food lover, it would be wrong not to take advantage of modern opportunities -- access to better ingredients, techniques, influences from other cultures. In Jersey City, the sandbox is full of children from different cultures, the grocery shelves stocked with ingredients that not so long ago seemed quite exotic. And Lyons is an inquisitive, creative chef, with an appreciation for other cuisines. Why wouldn't he try new things?

"We ran out of options so I got the end of my Taser and I probably ... I just start smashing his face to hell," Cicinelli commented to fellow officers on the 33-minute surveillance tape, according to a transcript provided by prosecutors because parts of the recording were muffled. "He was on something. Cause the three of us couldn't even control him."
The problems for Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) are not limited to Africa. The Swedish physician has a wife (Trine Dyrholm) and two sons in Denmark. His marriage is falling apart and he and his wife live in separate homes sharing custody. Their eldest, Elias (Markus Rygaard), who is being bullied at school, has founds a friend in newcomer Christian (William Johnk Nielsen). Christian carries his own excessive psychological baggage, having recently lost his mother to cancer. His anger issues boil over when he badly assaults Elias' bully.

A few of Mason's tips
On a voice vote in early April, the House backed the date shift as part of a bigger game and fish package. One lawmaker called it a ''bonus week'' rather than an early opener because there would still be hoopla around the May 12 weekend when the annual Governor's Fishing Opener is held. But it would be a week or more before any bill with the law change could reach Gov. Mark Dayton.
If the Hawks have anything on their side, it’s that they’ve played tough at home this season. Even Garnett said, after the game, he noticed a change in the atmosphere in Atlanta.
The first Saturday of every month, the museum holds Living History Flying Days, during which experts talk about a featured aircraft before it takes to the sky for a 20-minute demonstration.

No one need tell that to Gaborik, who has gone five straight without a goal since scoring in Game 1, just as no one need tell Gaborik what is expected of him tonight.
I wish companies revealed their softer side more often. There are any number of events that can happen, which we can't control. Those include, but aren't limited to, divorces, jury duty, job changes, sickness and an unexpected death of a friend or relative. Insurance doesn't cover all of these situations, unfortunately.
Now here's another fuzzy memory to clarify. Back in the early 1960s, I think we used to go to a movie theatre called the Loew's Mid-City, but I can't find anybody else who remembers it. I'm almost sure it was on Grand Avenue at the south end of "Theatre Row" in Midtown, down the street from the Fox and the old St. Louis (now Powell Hall) theatres.
"I'm just so afraid of accidentally colliding with one that the sight of a bike raises such anxiety that I subconsciously react with anger because it's even on the road with me," Doty emailed to Road Rant.

Professional athletes who pursue track & field in this country have the Olympics, once every four years. Do or die.
SINGLE-DECK blackjack was the most advantageous game for players when played by traditional rules, offering a microscopic .18% house edge, which means a player's estimated loss will be 1.8 cents for every $10 wagered. At the Flamingo's Party Pit, a player is estimated to lose more than 10 times that amount, nearly 20 cents for every $10.
In the SLCC's own tradition, the singing and blend were almost uniformly excellent. Several fine soloists contributed: soprano Kate Leslie and tenor Andy Jensen in the traditional "The Angel Gabriel," and soprano Kathleen Mead, tenor Keith Wehrmeier and baritone Nathan Ruggles in Sculthorpe's "It was under the leaves."

NEWARK — When Ahiezer Ortiz was in kindergarten in 1996, said his mother, Gladys Lorenzo, she knew he needed extra help by the way he paused for an unusually long time before answering questions. It turned out he had attention-deficit disorder and a learning disability.
He said the decision was made because of the poor economy, noting that attendance has been down throughout motorsport and other sporting events. The track recently held a two-race weekend, featuring a Nationwide and truck series race. Attendance was low for both races, especially the truck race, which was also marred by a power failure and rescheduled from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon.

The Cardinals were going off spring reports as well, and heard that Greinke wasn't only successful in spring (2.82 ERA) but toying with a new pitch. Greinke threw at least 20 cut fastballs in one spring start to master it. He riddled the Cardinals with it. The Cardinals never reached third base safely against him and only twice got the tying run to second base, each time with two outs.
As they prepare the day's menu -- donated soup from Olive Garden, macaroni salad from Nike, fresh baked biscuits, vegetable trays (another day it is salmon pasta from the kitchen at the University of Portland, garlic bread; always there are pastries or pies from Costco, bottomless cups of coffee) -- a man climbs the steps, looking for a place out of the rain and the cold. He carries an old plastic bag crammed with clothing, his fingers dotted with sores. "Would you like something to drink?" Candice asks. He doesn't answer, just sits for a few minutes, crying and talking to himself. Eventually, volunteer Dell Zimmerman coaxes him into helping her hang fall decorations around the inside of the bus, and soon, he loses himself in the act of tearing precise strips of tape, prettying the space for everyone who will soon climb aboard.
I don't like what I've become on my way to cheering for LeBron's defeat. It's not like me, this dancing on the grave, and I can no longer draw comfort from knowing I'm just one of gazillions who currently loathe him. The crowd is turning into a mob.

The research, reported Sunday, is one of the first long-term studies to test the effectiveness of drugs for diabetic children—estimated in the U.S. to number in the tens of thousands. It tested three different drug-based regimens aimed at controlling the disease and found that only about half the participants successfully controlled their blood sugar—despite relatively good compliance.
Robinson? He held on to 20 pulps. An N.C. Wyeth cover. A Leyendecker. An upgraded copy of the first Weird Tales (August 1939) that he bought off the newsstand. An Indian cover. A logging cover from Complete Stories And no Spicys, no Terrors, no Horrors, no gallery of space ships.
All eyes were on the big guy Sunday after a bruising previous three games in which the Yankee starters surrendered 16 runs in just 9-2/3 innings, culminating in Freddy Garcia pitching himself out of the rotation Saturday with a six-run battering from the Detroit Tigers in just 12/3 innings. Nobody had to tell Sabathia that if ever there was a time for him to pitch up to his salary, this was it. The bullpen was taxed and folks in Yankeeland are starting to get very nervous about this rotation.
The Agriculture Department raised its estimate by 12 percent for all-wheat production, totaling 2.245 billion bushels from September through August 2013. That would be the highest level since the 2008-2009 season. The yield per acre was forecast at 45.7 bushels.

Will Lee-Williams (Philly) sports nerdy, thick glasses and rolls through hits like "I'm Your Puppet" and "Me and Mrs. Jones." Alexander Elisa's Memphis is the least sophisticated of the trio but also the most sweet-natured. His gentle disposition gives extra heft to his renditions of "Hold On, I'm Coming" and "Tobacco Road." The most cocksure of the bunch is Detroit (Tyrick Wiltez Jones), who is sure that he has the competition won. After all, as he tells us, he has two distinct musical influences: He was born in the Motor City, but raised in Chicago. This double pedigree means he performs plenty of Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke and rolls through especially soulful renditions of "Lonely Teardrops," "Chain Gang" and "Wonderful World." Oddly missing, though, are the Motown classics you might expect to hear from an aspiring star with roots in the city that launched the careers of Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.
NEWARK — A city man admitted today in federal court to conspiring to commit carjackings between November 2010 and February 2011 in order to profit from the resale of vehicles, use the cars to carjack other vehicles and take items from passengers, said federal authorities, citing documents filed in the case and court statements.

"The Avengers" could climb past "The Dark Knight" and score the second-best debut in history Whether Avengers can compete with the record opening weekend of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2" at $169.2 million remains to be seen, but it certainly didn't have as many midnight fans. Potter broke midnight records in July 2011 with $43.5 million overnight.
ø"With the limited resources we have, it takes a little time to address the APR issue," said Southwestern Athletic Conference commissioner Duer Sharp, who welcomed the move.

A 99 cents iTunes song or iPhone app, for instance, would jump to about $1.05, after the 6 percent sales tax is added. But some worry that a broader range of products and services could end up being taxed than originally intended, based on the bill's language.
"I look at that a little different than some people. You mention Jake Delhomme, Jake played in the league a long time and when he couldn't play anymore because of the injury he wanted to do something. He wanted to. That coaching staff allowed him to take an active role, almost to the point of being an assistant coach. If I was still coaching I wouldn't do that. The mentor thing is overblown to me. I'm going to coach the player. I'm not going to have another player coach the player. They can be friends but when it comes to what I want him to do on the football field, that's my call not another player's call. So when Seneca said that and I know Seneca as well as anybody because he played for me, he is a good guy who wants to play football and is a very good player and has always been in a certain role but given the chance he has performed pretty well. Last year none of our quarterbacks had the supporting cast that we needed to get around them. His comments didn't bother me at all. I don't expect any of those guys to be mentors to anybody. I'm the mentor or the coach is the mentor."
The meeting included Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani; the powerful army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani; and Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, who heads the Inter-services Intelligence agency, which U.S. officials have singled out as the supporter of militant groups.

But he added an asterisk: "We're expecting that he won't (miss time), but to say that that can't happen, I can't say that. We feel that he can get ready to play, but bottom line is we'll have to wait and see what happens."
The high-sympathy, low-demand ethos has made the alternative schools wildly popular with young adults turned off by the city's traditional high schools (not to mention magnets for troubled and listless teens from nearby school districts). In New York City, about 5 percent of high school students attend community-based second-chance alternative high schools, known there as "transfer high schools"; in Portland, nearly 20 percent do.

Upon his arrival he's given a ride from the train station to the pub where he had planned to stay by a friendly local, Daily (Ciar�n Hinds). Evidently Daily is the only friendly person in town -- no matter who Kipps encounters in his dealings, the refrain is universal: Go back to the train station and return to London.

Written by Portlander Brent Rogers with his Texas-based brother, Klay, it feels like its aimed for audiences more willing to embrace the redneck cliches that permeate its characters.

Sarah Michelle Gellar of "Ringer" in a tie-dyed Monique Lhuillier is sure to split opinion, but we though it was beautiful and high-spirited. "Homeland" star Morena Baccarin's daring T-shaped neckline turned heads, as did "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" star Rooney Mara's. "Covert Affairs" doubled-down on the drama with a voluminous ballgown skirt and bodice with a wide neckline and sheeer panel. Katherine McPhee wore a pretty tea-length frock -- the better to show off, what, six-inch heels? And how did Sofia Vergara of "Modern Family" manage to walk at all in a second-skin Vera Wang gown with an extreme fishtail hem? Not that we're complaining.

For instance, a number of readers argued that California state spending has increased in recent years. That’s false.

So taxes may or may not end up being part of the solution, but they won’t be in lieu of cuts.
