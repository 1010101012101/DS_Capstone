No dolling-up to be found. (Importer: Grapes of Spain)

"For him, it was demeaning to the birds ... it wasn't how many you saw, but the ecology of the bird, its life history, it's relationships to other birds, to the habitat, it's status – those were the kind of things that mattered.

That in itself is a miracle, given that in 2004 - two years after Mustaine had folded the band - Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 million, claiming he'd been short-changed on profits.

True four-star dining experiences are a rare thing in Northeast Ohio. That makes the trek to Vermilion and an evening at Chez Francois all the more vivid an adventure. One wishes every serious diner could spend an evening in this charmingly romantic and surprisingly cozy spot, if only to experience how great is done. Rarely do you find a menu rife with so many delectable options that it's hard to content yourself with a single selection for each course. Chef John D'Amico apparently isn't satisfied with tempting you with a standing bill of fare. In addition to seasonal menus, there are weekly a la carte offerings, multicourse special menus, annual events (truffle dinners) and limited-time theme menus. Prices can be as rich as the fare, but trim your choices and you'll still feast: say, one of D'Amico's artful salads, a bowlful of his sublime lobster bisque (with plump chunks of meat) and good bread. Or splurge and revel in remarkably luscious duck, exquisite scallop dishes or exemplary renditions of classics such as beef Wellington or Dover Sole a la Veronique. By all means, linger over coffee and a shared dessert. On the heels of so sumptuous a feast, some selections may seem like overkill -- but a perfect walk-off after a remarkable evening of true culinary artistry.

The resort lost its allure after civil rights legislation opened up other options to black vacationers, but the area still has much to recommend it. It's in the heart of the Manistee National Forest and a half-hour from the beautiful Lake Michigan beaches of Ludington. Information: www.iaacc.com; www.lakecountymichigan.com.

I would lament a ruling striking down the individual mandate, but I would not denounce it as conservative justices run amok. As I listened to the arguments and read the transcripts, the justices struck me as a group wrestling with a legitimate, even difficult, constitutional question.

It is also an opportunity for Grammy voters to look prescient. Three years ago, Adele was named best new artist. This category has become something of a cultural joke: Past winners like A Taste of Honey, Men at Work, Marc Cohn, Arrested Development and, most infamously, Milli Vanilli were never able to match the initial success that helped net them their trophies.

Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said it raises "serious privacy concerns," especially for children using the devices, since "anyone who gains access to this single file could likely determine the location of a user's home, the businesses he frequents, the doctors he visits, the schools his children attend, and the trips he has taken — over the past months or even a year."

 When a cheese plate is delivered, it is common to identify the cheeses. We had to ask. What's worse, it was the owner of the bistro who dropped off the "fromage anonymous" with that lousy bread transformed into bad toast. (We had two questions about the goat cheese. What kind was it? And was it infused with herbs to give it that flavor? Our waiter later said it was Cypress Grove "Purple Haze," adding dismissively that it was just straight goat cheese. Wrong answer. You could see little flecks in the cheese, and I found Purple Haze at the Sacramento Natural Foods Co-op; ingredients include fennel pollen and lavender.)

"There's not a lot of time, as you know," he said. "It's one of the concerns that people have. There are roughly 100 days total. As far as transparency, my sense is that everyone who's part of this committee wants to make sure that there's transparency, that the public has an opportunity to have its input made, that other members of Congress do."

Jake's mom is concerned. Then the guys weigh in -- they're sort of worried about that "brutal honesty" thing, too. Vienna takes another chance to ding Tenley: she's a "really sweet girl," but she doesn't have a lot of opinions. Meeee-ow! A sister-in-law asks Vienna about her relationship with her girlfriends. Girlfriends? What are they? Vienna brushes it off, by bringing it back to her: Jake "brings out the best in me." Mom talks some more about women being the glue, and in a totally unconvincing turnaround, everybody suddenly decides that Vienna is A-OK. Did the producers put something in their water glasses?

The first thought when I had my second cocktail, the Bagby Back-Nine, is that it would be a great drink for the Preakness. What you want at the Preakness is something that is accessible and refreshing. The Black Eyed-Susan is the definition of a simple drink — some whiskey, some vodka, top it off with a sweet-and-sour mix that is almost always pre-made, never fresh.
The proposal -- which would replace the winner-take-all system with an allocation of electoral votes by congressional districts -- had stalled last month in the wake of a strangely surreptitious financial contribution to the cause from a Rudy Giuliani backer. The proposal had also faced a ferocious assault from Democrats (especially Clintonians) who fought it with money, focus groups, radio ads and red-hot rhetoric, insisting that the proposed reform was nothing but a "power grab" by Republicans, a dangerous and blatant ploy designed to rig an election through procedural trickery.
De Smet had refused to release the final transcripts of Bouman, who graduated from De Smet in the spring. He is now at Wichita State on both baseball and academic scholarships, but the school and the NCAA needed Bouman's high school transcripts to allow him to register for the second semester.

There's a second reason why photography in public places is frowned upon, according to Miller and others.

The most sublime moment for me in the park was late one afternoon after the rains cleared away. The lake shimmered with reflections of the lights of Paradise Pier. Then it hit me -- how big the lake was, how much space it took up. All this land that could have gone to more rides, more restaurants, more displays. Disneyland had its share of dud attractions and wasted space when it opened in 1955. The park had only 20 attractions on about 60 acres back then. Disney likes to point out that the new park has nearly identical numbers, 22 attractions on 55 acres.
