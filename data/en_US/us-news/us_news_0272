When you talk with Lyles, you understand you're mostly just listening and interjecting questions that redirect the conversation. He likes to talk. He laughs, a lot, too. In reporting this column, I spoke with numerous sources, many of which don't care for Lyles. But along the way, most said something such as, "If you talk with him for a while, you'll probably like him."
‘The Magic Flute” presents a fantasy world where musical instruments have supernatural powers and spirits guide a birdcatcher and a prince to the women of their dreams. It’s also an idealized realm, where a person can gain love and wisdom by overcoming obstacles.
"If it was something we had done on our own, and it hadn't been a citywide deal, I think we would have had a lot more negative feedback," he said.
A statue of Firestone faces the new tech center, and inside the building, many engineers have plaques with Firestone's picture on their cubicle and office walls -- commemorating patents and inventions.

And finally, here’s something that slipped through the cracks: rookie Jerrel Jernigan got a kick return after Devin Thomas muffed one. Jernigan picked up 19 yards and it was back to Thomas on the next one. We’ll see if the Giants look to find ways to get Jernigan involved.
I must confess that I love summer and fall evenings for providing the perfect backdrop for barbecuing dinner - although if necessary my husband and I will barbecue even when the temperatures drop and even in the snow.
By halftime, Tebow had completed only two more passes to Broncos players (four completions) than he had interceptions — two, by Eric Weddle and Quentin Jammer, who stepped in front of Demaryius Thomas on a crossing route in the second quarter.
Small hardware-store items in partially used packages or lumber can be valuable to any handyman. Charities and thrift stores would happily receive most kinds of items. Libraries welcome books for their used-book-sale fundraisers.
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — THE hem of my heavy Islamic cloak trailed over floors that glistened like ice. I walked faster, my eyes fixed on a familiar, green icon. I hadn't seen a Starbucks in months, but there it was, tucked into a corner of a fancy shopping mall in the Saudi capital. After all those bitter little cups of sludgy Arabic coffee, here at last was an improbable snippet of home — caffeinated, comforting, American.

"We absolutely want the event to go forward," said Angstadt, who plans to leave the IndyCar organization by the end of the year.

Great Oaks program aims to serve minority and low-income students in a rigorous college-preparatory environment. Great Oaks is modeled on the successful MATCH school in Boston and other high-performing charter schools.
The hiring has been met with controversy in the St. Charles West community due to the school board's decision to override the recommendation to hire a different coach and instead make the hire directly, sources have told STLhighschoolsports.com. That recommendation came from a panel of administrators, parents and players that interviewed finalists for the position.
Where's the water? All plants need it, but some need more than others. If you organize plants by their water needs -- those that tolerate drier conditions grouped in a sunny place, those that evolved in swamps in the soggy places, those that need frequent drinks together near the house -- you will spend less time watering. And less water.
Last year, the economy gained 1.8 million jobs, the employer survey found. That's an improvement over 2010's gain of about 1 million.
Ilgauskas, who gave the franchise 13 quality years, is one of the greatest Cavaliers ever. He played for us with broken feet when the team was no threat to anything but the cellar. He loved this town and the Cavalier franchise more than No. 23 did in his most affectionate days.

Maz Okoro is one of Britain's fastest runners in the 800 meters, a race that requires endurance and speed. She is training in both in the 400 and 800 meters, and while the training is all business, she said it's pleasant to be able to do some of her running in a venue like Dana Point Harbor. "Lovely," she called it.
Energizer, I saw publicist Jamie Haley, whom I met at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006 when she was there with Alton-native director Brian Jun ("Steel City"). Along with the batteries for which the bunny-themed company is best known, Haley showed me multiport wall plugs, tabletop solar cells and USB device chargers with clever cord-management reels. The company's increasing commitment to aesthetics was represented by a faux-candle LED night light and a glowing desk lamp that would complement the streamlined house of tomorrow. Now when the light of inspiration clicks on, it could say "Energizer."

LOS ANGELES -- Apple is shutting down Lala.com, the online music retailer it bought last year. The move comes amid speculation that Apple will soon offer a way for people to access songs from distant computers.
In selecting Nease, Tebow didn't exactly pick a high school powerhouse. Put it this way: In his first football season at the school, his sophomore year, Nease played in six homecoming games.
By that time, Leonard argues, the Coliseum groupies had rallied and Mayor Sam Adams was running for political cover. "While it's probably wrong to say they fought bringing the (baseball) Beavers to the Rose Quarter, they did nothing to help," Leonard said.
John L. Smith knows the Arkansas football program well and has a vested interest in its continued success. So a chance to help clean up the mess made by coach Bobby Petrino was too good to pass up.
The solution is to register Republican, like me. Now wait, I'm an atheist, wildlife conservationist, pro-gay marriage and pro-women's choice. I was a Democrat since I was 18. But recently I felt compelled to change my party affiliation because I'm totally frustrated with the tax-takers who control the Maryland Democratic Party.

While many big industrial companies still sound optimistic about 2012, a few, including 3M Co. and DuPont Co., that typically take it on the chin in the early stages of an economic downturn are starting to warn that they're feeling pain. Their customers, mostly other manufacturers, in some cases are "destocking," or cutting their inventories of raw materials, in the face of increased caution about the year ahead.
While Benson was busy dropping 150 yards rushing on the Browns, Rice was doing the same thing to the Saints: 31 carries for 153 yards and a 10-yard TD. In addition, Rice added five catches for 80 yards and a TD. The 233 yards from scrimmage were a career high for the third-year back and second-round pick out of Rutgers.

There’s no doubt some Florida players are steaming over Meyer’s decision to head back into coaching a year after leaving Florida. When Meyer said he was stepping down to be closer with his family and tend to his health, players surely supported him.
What a welcome sign of leadership in a town so accustomed to blowhards who, at the slightest sign of trouble, thump their chests and point fingers at others.
This actually turned out to be a different style of wine, but also very good. Although there was no information available about the proportions of grapes in the blend, it was a much softer wine, suggesting a higher amount of merlot in the mix. While it's also a medium-bodied red, this Médoc was lighter and drier than the Coppola claret and a bit more complex. It's an easier-to-drink wine with silky tannins and a little lower alcohol content of 12.5 percent. Because it's a little lighter, the Médoc would go well with grilled chicken as well as beef.

Short sales involve homes that are sold at a price that is lower than the balance owed. There are many reasons why such deals are a better alternative to foreclosure, including fewer fees and faster transfer of ownership, eliminating all the problems that arise when a house is left vacant after foreclosure.

In a perfect world, a governor would be able to balance the state budget without tax increases. But California isn't perfect - it's a heavily Democratic state. So what taxes would be on the table? How about Proposition 13? Don't tear it up, just raise the amount by which property taxes can increase annually from 2 percent to, say, 2.5 percent or index an increase to inflation. There needs to be more fairness in the system. A proposition designed to keep homeowners from losing their houses because of rising real estate prices shouldn't enable seniors to pay a pittance while they happily elect big spenders with no fear of paying the piper.
She called Roby over to demonstrate "how to put a boy in an arm- and headlock and flip them over."
Part of the appeal of college football is the lore, and no legend at Iowa is bigger than that of Nile Kinnick. The 20-foot-tall bronze statue of Kinnick, the star of Iowa's "Ironmen" team of 1939, does not depict him in a football uniform, just everyday trousers and a jacket. He is carrying several books. His helmet rests behind him, at his feet, like an afterthought.
get a price for a roundtrip ticket from Orlando to Dallas in two weeks. The least expensive available flight in the "Economy Super Saver" category cost $312, but it wasn't immediately clear whether that was one-way or round-trip. Moving to the next screen, I found options for my return flight: The least expensive was $835. Ouch. The third screen generated a subtotal - $1,148 - and then added taxes for a grand total of $1,179.
"When I come here," Bachman continues, "I always find myself wondering what happened to the people who owned this.… There's a tradition that says the world has shattered, that what once was whole and beautiful is now just scattered fragments. Much is irreparable, but a few of these fragments contain faint traces of the former state of things, and if you find them and uncover the sparks hidden inside, perhaps at last you'll piece together the fallen world."
The colonists left no published writings or diaries.
The documentary aspect of the early Westerns went beyond authentic settings. Two films in "Treasures 5" take on a slice of Oklahoma criminal history from opposing perspectives — that of frontier marshal Bill Tilghman, playing himself in "Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaw" (1915), and outlaw Al Jennings, who appears in his own rather more romantic recounting, "The Lady of the Dugout" (1918).

Obama: This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who are willing to work for it. That's what makes us special.

In yet another passage in the affidavit that caught the attention of those watching the racially charged case, prosecutors said Zimmerman "profiled" Martin just before the shooting. The document did not elaborate, and a spokeswoman for special prosecutor Angela Corey today refused to explain it.
Tony Cruz and Daniel Descalso both doubled to right to open the Cardinals' sixth for the Cardinals' first authoritative hits of the night. Descalso had been credited with an infield hit off Cincinnati starter Bronson Arroyo in the second when Reds first baseman Joey Votto, who had fielded the ball well behind first had thrown high to Arroyo covering the bag. The play would have been close anyway.
In a medium saucepan, bring milk to a boil. Slowly add grits, stirring constantly. Cook for 5 minutes or until thickened. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in cheddar cheese, margarine, salt and ground white pepper. Pour grits into a 1-quart casserole dish coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. If desired, top with a dash of pepper sauce.
The march passed Harriet Tubman Leadership Academy, one of two North Portland schools slated to close in the proposed budget. A school bell rang about 9 a.m. to cheers from the crowd, yet the chimes signaled administrators' decision to lock down the school. Medha Pulla, a 16-year-old Tubman senior, and a few classmates were out before the doors closed. They jumped in, saying it was good students were being heard.
“Ain’t Good Enough For You.” An upbeat party song reminiscent of “This Little Girl,” the 1981 Gary U.S. Bonds hit that Springsteen wrote and co-produced. There are some funny lines here (“I tried to change, I got a job in sales/I bought a shirt uptown, in Bloomingdale’s”).
The Tigers’ only run over the first six innings was an Allison Gasparino solo homer to lead off the fifth. They left eight runners on base until that point and trailed 3-1. Nicole Hazodvic then blooped a one-out single over first base and Ferrigno followed with a line-drive RBI triple to left. She later scored on a low pickoff throw to third by Eagles catcher Nicole Quintana to tie the score at 3.
According to Rudolph, Smith is "more of a leader by example. A quiet guy who is not likely to say a whole lot."
But as they spoke, news of another violent incident drew attention to how unsafe the country remains, even in some of its most guarded places. At Camp Bastion, a British air base in southern Afghanistan, an Afghan man drove a stolen pickup truck onto a ramp near the runway, emerging from the vehicle in flames about the same time that Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta was landing, officials said.
But against the Lakers, his presence was unmistakable. The Cavs went to him when they got behind early, and he got some easy baskets. Then, in the third quarter when the Lakers tried to make a run, they went back to him, and he had some easy baskets. He scored just 11 points and had seven rebounds, but he helped smother Lakers big men Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum, who were non-factors. It was just like he had helped hold down Dwight Howard that November night in Orlando.
Beyond curriculum, the case for the all-day program is made by families who say that getting out of school at 11:30 a.m. is out of sync with their lives. The majority of parents are unavailable to leave their jobs midday to pick up their youngsters, leaving them to either quit work or cobble together expensive and unwieldy child-care arrangements.
By emphasizing Obama’s record, the new ad showed that Obama’s advisers recognize he can’t win a second term simply by attacking Romney’s record in business and as Massachusetts governor. Instead, the ads are aimed at making a compelling case that despite the economic hardships faced by millions of Americans, Obama is the best overseer of the economy.
It is unclear how much the modified deal will save the district.
After all, who could possibly win an election by promising to embrace every opportunity to take part in meetings held in private? “I pledge to not reveal why decisions are made and my reasoning behind those decisions” does not smack of a campaign promise that will attract votes.
It’s not enough and it’s not appropriate, to simply tell our most challenged urban families, trapped in over 200 failing schools, that “life’s not fair.” That is the expressed attitude of some in the educational establishment in our state. It is not mine. It can no longer be the attitude of this legislature. Our job is to make the future better for every child in a failing school. We cannot simply accept failure or even mediocrity. We must demand excellence.

Online car dealer – Online car shoppers should be leery of a company that claims to be selling cars from an Idaho dealership, the Better Business Bureau said in a news release. Customers of Wartluft Motors said they have been asked to wire money for car purchases, but the cars do not arrive, the BBB said. The company lists cars for sale on its website, giving an Idaho address and telephone number. There is no car lot, the BBB said, and the cars will not be delivered.

But the real hero here is Joss Whedon, who directs the film with a fanboy's enthusiasm and a thorough knowledge of the genre. He manages to corral all of the heroes, and all of their egos, for a common purpose. A dual purpose, actually -- saving the world from bad guys and creating what looks to be almost the perfect summer blockbuster.
The reason was clear: Marshfield High of Coos Bay has had some of the best coaching in this event for decades. The coach's name was Stan Solomon and he died on Jan. 16 at the age of 69.
Not a dime of the 6 percent contributions goes into this general PERS fund. As a result, the 6 percent contribution has nothing whatever to do with the long-term viability of PERS, which subsists on employer contributions and investment returns. Eliminating the mandatory contribution would have no effect on the PERS system and would increase the budget cost for many employers who would be under pressure to replace the 6 percent cut with pay raises. Both employers and employees would also have to pay increased taxes on these salary increases.
The pontiff so far has failed to accept the 3-month-old resignation offers of three other Irish bishops who have been implicated in Catholic abuse cover-ups in Dublin. The reform-minded Dublin archbishop, Diarmuid Martin, had pressed for all three to go, but other Irish bishops have criticized Martin for not adequately defending the church against outside attack.

Most of the questions I had about the purpose of iBooks Author - a free app, mind you - were solved by the time I finished. This app is clearly geared specifically towards textbook creation. If you're trying to build something that's 100-500 pages long that's based off an outline containing dozens of chapters with dozens of sub-sections . . . it almost seems like an easy job. The app works like a mashup between Apple's iWork apps (Keynote and Pages, and I'm quite familiar with both). The only problems I encountered came when the app attempted to format my short story as though it were a matrix calculus textbook. In fact, it would have gone faster if I'd written the whole thing within the app itself - the authoring tools are certainly easy and robust - instead of trying to re-tweak the formatting of an existing word-processing file.

The pass-interference call on LB Michael Boley in the second quarter didn’t look like much to me live or on replays. Boley didn’t seem to contact WR David Nelson too aggressively there. The problem is it just didn’t look great. He didn’t turn around to find the ball and put his hands up as Nelson was leaping. Though there’s no more face-guarding rule in the NFL (it was eliminated years ago), the receiver will get the benefit of the doubt on this one. In my heart of hearts, that’s not pass interference, but I see why it was called. It didn’t matter much because the Giants recorded two sacks to push Buffalo out of field-goal range and force a punt.

Johnson's statement continued: "The recipe for this is straightforward - and it's the exact opposite of the failed stimulus of 2009: stop the out-of-control spending in Washington that is mortgaging future generations and creating an uncertain business climate; lower tax burdens on small business owners so they can invest in their companies and workers; reduce burdensome regulations and red tape; and, cut taxes on working families so they can keep more of what they've earned."

Does the child read at home? Is the child getting enough rest and proper nutrition? Is there violence in or around the child's home? Is a family just trying to survive? No amount of great teaching can counter a tired, hungry, scared or distracted child during a standardized test. Yet lawmakers are putting teachers' fates in the students' hands.

That may make it a nonevent, and maybe it'll just do the same numbers as 'Star Wars.'"

A: Hey, Fred: First, Pat Riley had a long-term plan, is very smart and cleared the most cap space in NBA history. Second, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James are basically paying Miller and Haslem by accepting less than market-value max. It was like intrateam revenue sharing, saving the owner money and costing the players, which did not make the union happy. As for Ilgauskas, he signed a minimum contract for $1.4 million.

Betsy had cashed in all of her two weeks' vacation for this trip and despite the fact that she had to put up with my snoring, it soon became apparent that she was having a blast matching the boys step-for-boisterous-step up and down the mountain trails, then kicking back and sipping wine with the adults like the woman of the world she was fast becoming. I had trained for four months slogging up and down the highest "hill" on the island where I live, a Calusa Indian burial mound with an elevation of 20 feet, while carrying a pack filled with coconuts, croquet balls and power bars.

Although I usually try to avoid gimmicky or cutesy wine labels, every so often something catches my eye. A case in point is Meditrina, a red wine that I found for $13.79 at Costco, 4200 Rusty Road. It wasn't so much the red label with a feminine white M or the name of the wine was that appealing, it was that it was produced by Sokol Blosser, a respected Oregon winery, and the fact that the wine was made from an unusual mix of grapes: syrah, zinfandel and pinot noir.

Sony is fighting a two-front war against Nintendo and Apple in mobile gaming, and to simply beef-up and improve the PSP to near-console level performance would be a fruitless exercise. Instead, Sony has indeed scaled-up the PSP and added contemporary connectivity features, such as WiFi/3G compatibility and access to services like Twitter, Facebook and Netflix. Also added are front and rear cameras and a multi-touch screen, features that will make smartphone and table users feel at home. The product still ultimately relies upon a user’s desire for an immersing video game experience on the go, which is great for consumers who can’t help but play games wherever they are, but dicey for the person who already has access to endless free entertainment tacked on their phone or tablet.

After a series of summer blockbusters that individually introduced Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, these Marvel comics characters all come together to save the world. Director and cowriter Joss Whedon pulls off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth) and giving each actor a chance to shine.

Mother's Day crowning glory
But the fact is arm length is a legitimate concern with a pass rusher, as short arms could impede a defender's ability to get away from those big-body, big-reach blockers.
Cain used the afternoon shadows to his advantage while changing eye levels against a fastball-hitting lineup. After striking out Hamels in the third, he buzzed an inside pitch that grazed Shane Victorino's stomach. The fiery leadoff hitter flung his bat in apparent anger as he walked down the line.
Those repairs, of course, are optional. Joe Salkowski, a spokesman for TEP, says that's one reason for the utility rebates, which are available to customers whether or not they have the $99 evaluation.

Also, it's important to note that these eateries use the words "cheesecake," "ice cream" and "cake" very loosely. While these common treats may look like the real thing, in many cases, there is no cheese in the cheesecake, no cream in the ice cream and the cake isn't even baked.
For another: Salt Fork -- surrounded by oil and gas wells -- is believed to lie atop the lucrative Utica shale, the oil-rich underground rock formation that stretches across parts of eight states, including eastern Ohio.

The son of a miner and janitor, Rukavina grew up on the Iron Range with Croatian and Italian roots. His early jobs included driving a milk truck and working in a taconite mine, where he joined the Steelworkers union. He was elected to the Virginia school board at age 22. He lost a Democratic primary for House in 1982, but went on to win a seat in 1986. After that, he won his re-elections with at least 70 percent of the vote.

If he wasn't collecting alley-oop lobs for dunks, he was abusing Carlos Boozer and the rugged Bulls' frontline with a variety of post moves. And he was clutch when it mattered most. He scored 11 consecutive Blazers points during a crucial fourth-quarter stretch and had 13 of their final 18 points of the game, helping the Blazers ice the impressive victory.

July 15 — Lenox Industrial Tools 301, Loudon, N.H.
Not that every sack was the offensive line's fault, mind you. Jay Cutler held the ball too long at least twice and any criticism must also be cushioned by Mike Martz having enough trust in the line to let Cutler throw the ball downfield more often then he did after the offensive coordinator emphasized the running-and short-passing games during the bye week last year.
"This is a sad day," Mack said after the meeting.
Did I say that he is an ultramarathon runner? Well, this extra weight had the advantage of slowing him down so I was very happy in the first few hours of hiking to discover that I could travel faster than he could. I don't know why I thought this was a benefit as we started our 19-mile trek through 5,000 feet of descent. We had "planned" to camp overnight at the halfway point, but we made it there by lunchtime (ultrarunners apparently haven't learned to accurately estimate walking times) and decided to complete the trek into the Urique canyon in one day. As the campsite proved to be nothing in the middle of nowhere, I preferred this option to spending the afternoon on a blazing hillside with a slightly weird misguided guide - not to mention the overnight blanket-using scenario.
He was particularly harsh about Obama wanting to have talks with Iran, a country that he believes aims to wipe out Israel. Santorum said he does not think Obama supports Israel enough.

To get a responsible solution, both sides are going to have to compromise. Democratic legislators are right when they say that California can't cut its way out of a $14 billion budget deficit - but Republican legislators are right when they argue that large annual increases in spending are unsustainable.
Then Korreck left the room.
Newsome made a career choice of personnel over coaching under Belichick's wing in Cleveland in the 1990s. Although Newsome's Ravens destroyed Belichick's Patriots in a 2009 season wild-card game, this is the first time they are meeting in an AFC title game. That playoff win was Newsome's only victory in six meetings against the man he regards as his NFL mentor as a franchise-builder.

"The thing that struck me was the glowing things that so many of their children said about them -- how strong that bond was, often for a mom who wasn't necessarily what a mom is supposed to be" said Deputy Metro Editor Karl Turner, who edited the stories. You think, would I be bitter if my mom left me with auntie or in foster care? But these kids . . . they'd go out looking for their moms at night. They expressed regret that they couldn't save their moms. It's not supposed to be your job to save your mom . . . mom is supposed to take care of you. But that's what so many of these kids tried to do."
The Mazda3 has long been one of my most recommended compact cars. Available as a sedan, hatchback or – in Mazdaspeed3 form – a tarmac-burner, the car offers good looks, a comfortable ride and – at least not when in Mazdaspeed3 form – good fuel economy.

TRENTON — A home repair sting staged after Tropical Storm Irene has resulted in charges against a dozen unregistered contractors in New Jersey.
Ravens officials obviously were optimistic after their visit a couple of weeks back with Bryant McKinnie, but that hardly means the pressure is off the big left tackle. Ravens coach John Harbaugh said at last week’s owners meetings that McKinnie was in the “same shape he was in when he left.” Obviously, you can take a positive out of the fact that there has been no offseason regression, but team officials want McKinnie to be in better shape than he was in last year. They want him to be able to move better and be a little quicker. The next couple of months will be huge for McKinnie because I’d be surprised if the Ravens, at some point of the draft, don’t draft an offensive tackle. They also appear to be pretty high on Ramon Harewood, who spent last season on injured reserve.

HOUSTON - Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is left-handed now.
Santorum's latest deconstruction of his own over-the-top remarks involves his suggestion to a tea party audience in Ohio that President Obama was animated by "some phony ideal, some phony theology. Oh, not a theology based on the Bible — a different theology." Stung that anyone would interpret those words as impugning Obama's Christian faith, Santorum has insisted that the "theology" of which he was complaining had to do with Obama's beliefs about the dangers of climate change.

Vann, a San Francisco writer whose books include the equally harrowing "Legend of a Suicide" and "Caribou Island," eventually introduces us to the extended family, a small crew dense with dysfunction: a senile grandmother, the indeterminate ghost of an absent father, an embittered aunt and her shrewd seductress of a daughter. "Meal of a Hundred Humiliations," Galen calls one of their family dinners, "because it was better to give it a name in advance. That could take away some of its power."

This piece of Southern-fried silliness features Queen Latifah as a feisty choir director named Vi and Dolly Parton as G.G., a wealthy member who bankrolls the tiny church that the choir calls home.

Well, there's always the NFL Draft. The Rams have filled several holes in free agency and more work remains on that front. That marketplace seems pretty well picked over, but the draft will provide ample opportunity to upgrade skill and depth. The process of upgrading this roster for 2012 will continue right into the season. And by acquiring future No. 1 picks, the Rams reminded us this will be a multi-year overhaul.

"The resorts have learned from the airlines that one size does not fit all," Roberts says. "Yes, there's a last-minute rack rate if you're willing to pay it.

My reaction to this totally unenlightened exchange is this: Debate over important societal issues by the ignorant should be left to politicians, for they are professionals with regards to talking hot air.

Scout.com rates Armstead as the No. 2 prospect overall in the country and as the No. 1 offensive tackle. The recruiting site 247Sports ranks him No. 4 in the nation as an athlete (meaning he has multiple position possibilities).

As my Facebook friends reminded me, 2011 was also a good year for discovering the power of joining together. Following the Good Friday tornadoes in Bridgeton, I heard stories of neighbors supporting each other and businesses cooperating in new ways. Churches opened doors and recruited volunteers. Strangers found common purpose in helping others. Later in the year, new experiences of community continued as work crews from across the country converged on Joplin, MO to share gifts of hope, love and friendship. The storms were certainly uninvited guests, but they forged important bonds that remind us that God works miracles when neighbors stand shoulder to shoulder.

In other words, both the judge and the commissioners who called upon him to intervene were operating outside their jurisdiction. (ORS 246.200 makes it clear that only the county clerk, under the direction of the secretary of state, has authority to conduct county elections.)

The Walter part is true, and so is the desire to go to New York. Not the rest of it. Walter is an escapee from a loosely guarded internment camp for Germans and landed in the cove by accident. He was a musician on the Vaterland, a trans-Atlantic ocean liner that rivaled the Titanic in size and luxury. The ship was held in port when World War I broke out in 1914 and in 1917 was seized by the U.S. government, renamed the Leviathan, and used as a Navy troop ship. The German employees were sent to an internment camp in North Carolina until after the war. (When peace broke out the Leviathan operated again as a luxury liner until 1934.)
