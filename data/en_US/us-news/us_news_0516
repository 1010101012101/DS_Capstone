These are events where "pop goes God." Or to turn the phrase one more time: "God goes pop." Whether its high-brow or low-brow, high culture or pop culture, I find these events endlessly intriguing. They are epiphanies to me. And they can happen, virtually or literally, anywhere.

The nightly main course specials are exciting in their rustic minimalism. One night Hallowell offered oxtail braised in balsamic ($18), a preparation that concentrates the muscular flavor and caramelizes the exterior, setting up an alluring contrast. On the same night he baked wild salmon in the wood oven ($18), arranging the fillet on a cranberry beans ragout. Another time he featured long-cooked pork shoulder ($18) draped over a mound of creamy mashed potatoes served with a few slender green Romano beans.
The ability to cram that many pixels into a relatively small space is on the cutting edge of display manufacturers' capabilities, he said.

Beall: When the Mayor shows up at school to be Principal for a Day, it's a novelty and elementary school students definitely take note and pay close attention. They've often never seen or spoken to a "real" Mayor before and they want to see for themselves what you're like.

All the songs were written quickly, we usually used one of our first few takes, and we all had a blast making this one from beginning to end."
It was one thing to put up with the hijinks of Owens and Moss when they were elite players. For many teams it was worth the gamble in dealing with these "me-first" players because they were difference makers. They're no long difference makers. They're both a couple of years removed from elite status. Moss is 35; Owens will turn 39 before next season is out. Why not look to the future instead of the past? Why not give the reps in the offseason program and in training camp to players that are going to be around for a while? Why not sign a free agent in his prime, or draft a young, promising talent?

For French Laundry chef Thomas Keller, cooking outside of his restaurant is a rarity. "I hardly ever cook at home," he says. Although Keller does get Christmas Day off (both French Laundry and his New York restaurant, Per Se, are closed), he isn't likely to spend it in his home kitchen. So his Chronicle menu has little to do with tradition, he says, and everything to do with "what I would enjoy having at this time of year."

Bob "No Pension Plan" Filner: Full-blooded, cynical, mush-mouthed politician. Like Fletcher, "Trust me, I'm a leader and compromiser, and I can get something done." But not enough; he wants to satisfy everybody and he's clearly in bed with the unions. He's also a liar – Prop. B does not "impose a zero-pay increase on city employees." Prop. B freezes pension calculations at current levels for five years. Employees can get all the raises they can bargain for; they just won't add to their pension calculations for five years. – Ralph Nebiker, San Diego

This morning I went into the emotional closet of my psyche and brushed past the rosy pink of contentment, the steely blue of determination and the sunny yellow of cheerfulness.

Of the 10 gold medals we awarded, just one went to an alicante bouschet (two had been entered). It was the Harmony Wynelands Winery 2009 Lodi Alicante Bouschet. I voted gold largely on the strength of the wine's beckoning perfume, jamminess and balance. It's a deeply colored wine, with a huskiness to match in the juiciness of its fruit and in the mass of its build, but its tannins had been so nicely massaged they didn't taste at all barbed. Suggestions of chocolate and smoke added to the wine's intrigue.

3. Metta World Peace played his best game as a Laker. Through both the good and the bad, World Peace is one funny player to watch. In this case, World Peace's career-high 26 points as a Laker remained all positive. He made step-back fadeaways as if he were Bryant. His five-of-eight mark from three-point range came on balanced shots and in rhythm within the team's offense. His steal on Duncan and ensuing fastbreak layup capped the Lakers' 8-2 run to open the third quarter. World Peace simply provided everything, ranging from hustling on transition defense, moving off the ball to find open shots and sharing encouraging words with teammates.

"I got the idea from the old Hollywood Canteen movies in the '40s," he says.

Tall, lean, and closemouthed, Cannon makes Joe an imposing contrast to Slover's Chris. But both characters have complicated attitudes toward Sharla and Dottie, probably toward women in general, and the actresses' wary body language implies a lifetime of watchful waiting, expecting men to set limits and issue commands. Miller and Fenton reveal these very vulnerable characters down to bare bone; sometimes, it's almost too much to watch.

Before each of those games, Rivera spent part of batting practice chasing flies like he has been doing since early in his career. He moved in the outfield with such a grace that could have mistaken him for a center fielder. His routine should not be faulted, either, because Rivera has not been on the disabled list since 2003.
Trustees are fiduciaries -- responsible for guiding their institutions when they're thriving and nurturing them when they're not. They're also responsible for ensuring transparency.

Game 4 probably stemmed from his resentment that Dwyane Wade is now the alpha force, the "closer" in tight games. James is a beta who is heading -- since even Chris Bosh has made a bigger shot, winning Game 3 with a contested jumper -- toward the lesser-known Greek letters in Miami's little fraternity of front-runners. By childishly leaving it up to the alpha player to win the game on his own, James, who went to a stacked Miami team because he thought winning a championship would be easy there, made everyone's task much harder.
Over the last 41 years, film historian and author Marc Wanamaker had acquired some 200,000 photographs chronicling the history of film production in North America from 1909 until the present day. Many of these photographs are one of a kind.

Prosecutors used Barnett to try to establish that Congress was within its bounds when it called the hearing, which took place two months after Clemens was named in the Mitchell Report on the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. The government has maintained that the validity of the Mitchell Report was important, in part because of overall concerns over steroids and HGH as a public health issue.

Moms usually get a break from the kitchen on Mother's Day. But if your mom loves to putter in the kitchen, she might like one of these new cookbooks. Here's a peek inside them.
Four miles away in Old Town, an old wooden bandbox of a ballpark once stood where there's now a classically designed red-brick ballpark that's the home of the San Francisco Giants. Scottsdale Stadium old (1956) and new (remodeled in 1992) has served as spring home to five major-league teams. I am a partner on a pair of season tickets right on top the Giants dugout, which provides, for my money, one of the best up-close views of the action anywhere in the league. The post-game parties extend for miles in every direction, but my favorite local watering hole is Karsen's Bar & Grille (7246 E. 1st St.), about three blocks away.

The working estimate for ballpark rehabilitation is $300 million. That covers the widened concourses and expanded concession and restroom facilities promised by outgoing owner Frank McCourt, before he ran out of money.

It is probable that the Greek government will default by the end of the year, perhaps followed by Portugal, Spain and Italy. The shock to international markets would further undermine the economic confidence needed for a healthy American recovery.

Gianni (Gianni Di Gregorio, the director of "The Salt of Life") is 60. The most notable features on his careworn face are the bags under his eyes. He lives in a spacious apartment with his wife, his daughter and his daughter's boyfriend, Michelangelo, who talks with him more than the other two combined. On the ground floor of his building lives the cheerful Aylin (Aylin Prandi), who pretends to be madly in love with him. He walks her St. Bernard and his own inconspicuous family dog, whose breed he doesn't even know or care about.

It was time to focus on losing weight. I'd been told the donation would be easier if I lost 30 pounds. I'd tried diets before, but couldn't lose that weight on my own. But on April 14 I started a weight program, and stuck to it. By June 16, I lost the weight – and kept it off.

Large windows pour in light.
Woerther said he wants to seek out and listen to the desires of residents, ensuring their involvement on major decisions which impact all of them.
I see an improvement, but that must continue. Too many time last year I saw the inability to turn double plays turn into big rallies for the other teams, or a ball falling safely between an infielder and outfielder. I think Alexei Ramirez has a good chance to win a Gold Glove Award this year. I like the fact that De Aza gets to the spot where the ball is hit, rather than try to time his arrival at the same time the ball arrives. But their defense will improve only if Dayan Viciedo does in left, Rios hits the cutoff man from right and the pitchers and catchers shut down the running game.
Rowe said he charged him basically for his review time, usually $400-$500. Otherwise, the cost would have been two or three times higher.

But despite all those deliriously happy days, the passing of the old ballpark in 1966 seemed right. Even to an unenlightened 14-year-old (that's probably redundant, sorry), the place was looking kind of shabby, and the surrounding neighborhood could be intimidating, especially after night games.
While worker output rose, the number of hours worked increased by an even larger amount. That lowered productivity in the first quarter at an annual rate of 0.5 percent, the Labor Department said Thursday.
øAs is the case with the LeapPad from Leapfrog, the InnoTab isn't nearly as high tech, big-screened or versatile as the iPad. But it is built for the tough love that kids will give it, all of its content is educational and at $79, it costs substantially less than the $499 iPad.

Read: Big tobacco, fast food, television, major pharmaceutical corporations, the diet industry, all with viciously vested interests in pumping you full of toxins and misinformation, and then convincing you it's far too difficult to change, quit, figure out for yourself that snapping out of the culture's cage of perceived torture really isn't all that difficult.

A stripped-down Prius C One can get you in the club for just under $19K; you’d probably want to part with another thousand to enjoy such luxury features as variable intermittent windshield wipers, a 60/40 split fold-down rear seat with adjustable headrests, cruise control and the center console with armrest and storage compartment in the Two.
By the dawn of the ’70s, there was nothing commonplace about Parliament or Funkadelic. Both groups began chasing complex arrangements, incorporating extended jams into their songs and enthusiastically indulging in the psychedelic experimentation then in vogue.

This is one of the reasons she has been my dentist for more than a decade - because going to the dentist, like eating hot Asian food, can sometimes be a little painful, and a touch of sweetness always balances out the experience. Of course the dentist also has to be good at her job, which mine is, and the food has to be not just hot but also good, which is why I chose Lao Sze Chuan (2172 S. Archer, 312-326-5040) for some Riesling research.
Keel had to deal with one of soccer's downsides when he scored an own goal in Sunday's 3-3 draw between New York and Portland. Keel was trying to stop a crossing pass from the Timbers' Jorge Perlaza, but his sliding momentum knocked the ball into the Red Bulls' net in the 68th minute.
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Even though he failed last week to keep his job as the state’s top lawyer, Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray soon might have an opportunity to serve the state in a different legal post.
Since that time, whenever any of that group of friends discussed delaying some adventure or trip because of day-to-day pressures and preoccupations, the others always countered with "Remember Joan" and urged her to go ahead while she could. My wife and I, too, often used this rationale -- for which I am very grateful, because we took some great Joan trips before a stroke grounded my wife for the remainder of her days.

"He is impatient like I am," she said. "We both have a sense of urgency and the importance of taking care of kids right now. With the health crisis right in front of us, we can't wait another minute."
Even the best goalie in the world, Solo, couldn't reverse the momentum in the tiebreaker. When a lead unravels so late, when a team has led for so long, when it has been dominant to so little result, and then when it has been extended to the crapshoot of penalties, it seldom can regroup.
COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Republican-dominated apportionment board approved a new legislative map Wednesday that tilts heavily to favor GOP candidates, but legal hurdles remain if Democrats decide to bring a suit.

But even that approach is far from a sure thing. Whatever voters saw in Walter Mondale's choice of Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, it didn't spur them to support a ticket that went down in flames in 1984. Controversies surrounding Ms. Ferraro's financial affairs may have overshadowed whatever benefit came from choosing a woman as a running mate.
By 2014, Madison is projected to have about 61 percent low-income students, Franklin about 53 percent and Cleveland 33 percent.
Yet Republicans have dismissed his "investment" proposals as merely new spending. Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, giving the GOP's response, said the nation was at "a tipping point" leading to a dire future if federal deficits aren't trimmed. The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the president had gotten the message from the November midterm elections and "changed the tone and the rhetoric from the first two years."
Kid-friendliness: No kids menu, but burgers, pizza, pasta.
School districts across Oregon are busy setting next year's budgets. Years of stagnant state funding and the rising cost of employee pay and benefits have pressed nearly every district against the wall. The proposed cuts in Portland Public Schools are similar to cuts everywhere, and they'll lead to bigger class sizes and fewer opportunities for children.
Pi owner Chris Sommers says he was drawn to the California common beer style because of his restaurant's ties to that state -- both he and executive chef Marc Baltes spent time working in San Francisco, which is where Sommers discovered the cornmeal-crust pizza that would become Pi. He also says he likes that the style presents "a full-flavored, moderately hoppy beer" that can appeal to a range of beer drinkers.

RENEHAN: It'll be 5 to 7 prints the first weekend, and then will get wider based on how it performs. It's just L.A., Ontario and Orange County at first. It's a big break for us to be in the bigger movie theaters because our young audience doesn't go to the Arclight. They go to the big theaters in places like The Block.
Norwegian Cruise Line made headlines this year with its Norwegian Epic, a 4,100-passenger ship with 128 solo suites for single travelers, an option that definitely got the competition's attention. The Epic, which has been cruising the Caribbean, will make a 15-day combined transatlantic crossing and Mediterranean cruise, departing May 7 from Miami, with Barcelona, Spain, its final destination.
A sudden downpour stranded Shelley Risk at a restaurant in San Francisco a few weeks ago. Risk, a public relations manager at a tech startup, figured the chances of hailing a cab were slim, so she took out her smart phone and, with the push of a button, ordered a ride through Uber, a mobile app. A few minutes later, a sleek town car pulled up and took her home.
Kaye said that another likely issue on appeal will be whether Judge Walter applied the solicitor general's foreign policy concerns too broadly. TheU.S. Supreme Courthad asked the solicitor general, who represents the federal government in Supreme Court proceedings, to weigh in as it considered whether to decide the constitutionality of a 2002 California law that Von Saher initially had relied on, suspending the statute of limitations for suits to reclaim Nazi-looted art. Those concerns have vanished, Kaye said, because Von Saher's suit now relies on California's "general" statute of limitations, which doesn't mention the Holocaust or raise constitutional issues related to federal foreign policy prerogatives.
The results are beginning to show. The former American League MVP has gone 7 for 14 his last four games with a double and three home runs after a slow start to spring training. Gardenhire said that was all part of the plan.

Religious leaders say the moral support is often more critical than the cash.
Umenyiora thinks he can still get what he wants, even if it’s not with the Giants.
This almost palpable fug of failure and disappointment is a key counterpoint to Smiley's hunt. On the one hand, "Tinker, Tailor' is brilliantly of its time: the novel reeks of England in the early 1970s, of a dismal freezing winter, of a time when Britain was flailing and failing at the end of Empire yet still fighting the Cold War. And losing it.
While public focus has been on safety at regional airlines, NTSB is also exploring the code-sharing relationships and "alliances" between U.S. airlines and foriegn carriers.

The company's loss of its certification as a woman-owned business has created problems not only for the schools but also for the Cook County Jail. McMahon delivers milk to the jail as a subcontractor to Aramark Correctional Services, which is required to subcontract at least 10 percent of its business to certified woman-owned companies. Now that McMahon is no longer a certified WBE, Aramark is no longer in compliance with its Cook County contract, according to a March 28 letter that the company received from LaVerne Hall, the county's contract compliance director.
Reutter's coach, Jae Su Chun, doesn't expect Reutter to dominate as she did the last time St. Louis hosted an event, the 2008 U.S. Championships, when Reutter won the second of four consecutive national titles. His goal for this weekend is to see her compete "at 85 percent instead of 100."

ESPN analyst Tom Jackson on Trent Richardson: "He's that rare back who can be on the field all three downs because he's so good at catching the ball out of the backfield. But I think the thing that is most impressive when you watch him on film, when you watch him in games: He is a finisher. Every single down you watch him carry the ball, there are two or three yards at the end of it that will be positive yards for the Cleveland Browns.''
Adrine, president emeritus of the Norman S. Minor Bar Association, the largest organization of African-American lawyers in the state of Ohio, said McGee Brown "knows what the judiciary is about and how it functions."

Nutrition: Moderation works well for Edwards; she doesn't deny herself anything. She eats a balanced diet with very little red meat. Her protein sources include chicken, fish, beans and rice and, once in a while, eggs. She also likes tofu but has a hard time selling it to her family. She eats a lot of vegetables as well as a daily apple that she shares with her mini-dachshund, Frankie. She drinks coffee and tea, and has an evening glass of wine or beer. She takes a multivitamin, calcium, vitamin D3 and fish oil. She likes sweets but, again, does a good job with that moderation thing. She enjoys reading in The Oregonian what Dr. Oz and Colin Hoobler have to say.

For Greece, using the name of the Republic of Macedonia implies the landlocked country of 2 million people has territorial claims to the northern Greek region also known as Macedonia, and represents a serious threat that goes well beyond symbolism.

In addition, the manual for the first time would include gambling as an addiction, and it might introduce a catchall category -- "behavioral addiction, not otherwise specified" -- that some public health experts warn would be too readily used by doctors, despite a dearth of research, to diagnose addictions to shopping, sex, Internet use or playing video games.

I, for one, am sick of these protesters. They not only damage property, they don't clean up after themselves. Somebody else has to clean up the mess they make. We're all fed up with Washington. If you're so fed up, go to Washington and protest. Don't protest around here. The people that have to work every day have to go by and look at you. If you're so disgusted with yourself, why don't you go flip hamburgers somewhere for a job? I started working when I was 16-1/2 years old and I worked 40 years. My father gave me the choice of either going back to school or going to work. And I went to work. There were jobs then, but it wasn't a high-paying job, but it lasted me 40 years. Now I'm 80-something years old and I have to watch these protesters carry on because they're so upset that nothing's going their way. Get out and work a little bit for a living, you bunch of bums. Don't expect everybody to hand it to you on a platter.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment climbed to 77.8, the highest since January 2008, from 76.4 the prior month. The gauge was projected to drop to 76, according to the median forecast of 68 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.

In the manuals of corporate dress codes, a woman's handbag rarely merits a mention. Yet the purse a woman carries to work is much more than a place to hold a hairbrush. A purse can send a signal about its owner's character, says Monica Botkier, a New York-based handbag designer. "The bag tells a lot," she says. "When I read a woman, I read her bag. It's a little Rorschach test."

Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said before the game that he thought he left his starting unit on the floor too long to begin Game 3. He went to the bench for the first time with just over five minutes to go on Saturday.
The two most famous planes in the valley are both Gulfstream Vs, owned by Ellison and Apple's Steve Jobs (a trinket from Apple).

"I knew how important it would be for us to get LeBron, and that place was so full of electricity that night it was just unbelievable," said Carr, who will join Fred McLeod and Campy Russell as hosts of Tuesday's lottery party at Cadillac Ranch in downtown Cleveland.

Fahrenheit in Tremont is often mentioned near the top of any list of the city's best -- and for good reason. If there is a common thread among chef-owner Rocco Whelan's eclectic dishes, it's the kitchen's ability to highlight a wide range of flavors, both bold and subtle, that beautifully complement the main ingredients. Three very different entrees each yielded pleasing results on our first visit. Sweet and Sour Salmon surrounded a perfectly seared, medium-rare piece of buttery salmon with the horseradish-punch of wasabi mashed potatoes and the not-too-sweet-and-sour flavors of miso, soy sauce and pickled cucumbers. The cucumbers added a nice crunch. A dinner companion's Coffee and Mustard Crusted Pork Tenderloin was another flavor bomb. Tender, moist pork came with maple-glazed sweet potatoes, garlicky spinach and crunchy toasted macadamia nuts. My wife's Garlic-Marinated Grilled Hanger Steak, one of several new dishes on the recently updated seasonal menu, is a unique cold-weather creation. Tasty slices of beef rest on a bed of roasted root vegetables bathed in a rich red-wine syrup flavored by fresh thyme. Fahrenheit's three-course dinner for $30 (available Monday-Thursday) is a winner. Diners select from lists of appetizer, entree and dessert options. I chose a Chicken Spring Roll (ultra-crisp and nongreasy), Kobe Beef Short Ribs (magically tender and richly flavored) and Molten Chocolate Cake (decadent). My wife's Butter-Poached Lobster Macaroni & Cheese with cognac reduction, chives, brie and goat cheese matched the dessert in high-calorie richness, and there was no skimping on sweet lobster chunks. If our sampling was any indication, anyone who ventures off the cold Cleveland streets and into Fahrenheit will feel lucky, indeed. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer.
If it's still frozen, and you want to cook it Thursday, thaw in cold -- and we mean cold (not warm) -- water, 30 minutes per pound. Check your microwave manual for low-power thawing, but that method might also cook extremities. Make sure it goes in the oven immediately after microwave thawing.
In Missouri that information has been, literally, a state secret. But a law that took effect last week puts it in the public domain.
Kobe Bryant, who faced sexual assault charges in 2003 before they were ultimately dropped, could relate to Hill's circumstances. Bryant attended court cases in Eagleton, Colo., even on game days, yet managed to average 24 points in the 2003-04 season.
David Sarasohn's Oct. 12 column did little more than bash Smith on taxes and didn't say one positive thing about Merkley. Sarasohn didn't give even one reason why Merkley is qualified to serve in the U.S. Senate. Could it be that there isn't one?

Just when you thought the debate mania of the current campaign might never end, one or more of the four surviving candidates seem to be having second thoughts about the value and wisdom of so many talkathons. As a result, the one planned for March 1 by CNN in Georgia has been scrapped, with Mitt Romney the first to pull out, followed by Ron Paul.

Nobody doubted this "man" was ready for anything; he was ready and anxious to "stand his ground." After all, who knows what dangers lurk in the children's play area or from a couple of young teenagers just browsing, not to mention the hazards imposed by elderly mall walkers. I was afraid someone might laugh this cowpoke down and he would have responded with hot lead.
