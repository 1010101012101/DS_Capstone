It was only [supposed to be] for one episode, so he didn't have the staccato "yeah, that's right" response. I funky-ed him up a bit, made him a little weird, and Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David seemed to take a liking to it. Essentially, it was just the mechanic who stole Jerry's move and used it on Elaine and then Jerry confronts him. So I decided to go in a different direction with the character. What they originally had in mind was a Vinnie, a New York guy, and David was anything but that. He was from another planet, forget about what part of New York he was from.

Schofield spoke extensively about the district's reserve fund balance, which at 3.4 percent, is substantially lower than similar-sized districts in the region. McMinnville and Centennial school districts both maintain reserves of more than 10 percent. Forest Grove has spent down it reserves each of the last four years, Schofield said, in part to keep class sizes smaller than in many districts. Forest Grove's average class size this year is 28:1. "If you don't have adequate reserves," Schofield said, "everything becomes an emergency."
Galls do raise concern but even though unsightly cause little harm. As you found, it is probably impractical to apply sprays as you would have to time them to the presence of the insects which can be throughout much of the warmer months. You may see a little stem decline from galls and this can be pruned out when noted. Most gardeners ignore galls as they rarely cause severe damage to oak trees.

Q. Where have you traveled to that most reminded you of home?
Even so, I found myself curious about Altman, the late director. Most of the selection comes from the director's December 2001 visit to the institute to discuss the about-to-be-released upstairs-downstairs comic mystery of "Gosford Park." The director was then 76 and the film would arguably stand as the best of his later work, earning seven Oscar nominations (Julian Fellowes won for his screenplay).
Even so, the sight of Rose going down late in Saturday's 103-91 victory sent a major chill through Chicago and stirred a debate over whether he should have been in the game at that point.

That would be Doug Glatt, a small-town nobody who rises to local fame when he knocks out a player who comes into the stands to fight fans. Glatt can't play hockey, or even skate. But his hammer-like fists get him hired as a goon -- someone sent onto the ice to distribute justice or take out the other team's star. His effectiveness in the role leads to promotion to a higher minor league team, romance with a not-so-nice girl, and a showdown with a legendary goon he has always admired.

Because attribution for cyberattacks takes time and is sometimes impossible to determine with certainty, a military response of the type promised in the Pentagon report will be slow and uncertain to avoid mistakenly initiating war with the wrong country. Our adversaries understand this. They also know that even when the government can attribute an attack, its lawyers place tight constraints on the use of offensive cyberweapons. Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of U.S. Cyber Command, says he needs "more authority" to defend national interests in cyberspace. All of these factors undermine the credibility of the government's threatened response to large cyberattacks.

Personal finance and financial crisis are a regular part of people's lives. Student loan debt now eclipses credit card debt. Homeowners continue to lose homes to foreclosure. The stock market goes up and down. How, though, do young people learn about personal finance? How do we prepare them to be good stewards of their own financial resources? Interestingly (or shockingly) 90 percent of youth in the United States graduate high school without financial education.

"As more and more people use phones and keep data on phones, and PCs aren't as relevant, the bad guys are going to follow that," security expert Charlie Miller told the AP.
Studies have consistently shown that immigrant labor increases overall economic productivity while raising wages and the standard of living for domestic workers. In fact, the Coalition for a Working Oregon commissioned an independent economic analysis that found the elimination of immigrant workers in the state would significantly retract the state's economy and eliminate tens of thousands of "native" jobs. You cannot disconnect immigrant labor from non-immigrant labor;everything is interdependent. Without a strong labor force, our local businesses, tax revenues and overall economic output all suffer.

Opening Sunday, March 18, through May 13: Charles Way's adaptation of the epic Han Christian Anderson masterpiece marks the debt of the renovated Elaine Wolf Theatre at the Mizel Center for Arts and Culture. In it, he conveys the power of friendship, loyalty and creativity through brilliant dialogue and extraordinary characters. Long ago, the powerful Snow Queen ruled her magical kingdom with a heart of ice. But her magic bwaned when her enchanted mirror was shattered and shards rained down to earth. Each piece was infused with the vanity of the Snow Queen and had the power to cool people's hearts - making them see only the cold, darkness of the world. Everything changes for the little girl Gerda when her eccentric and creative friend, the boy Cei, gets a shard from the enchanted mirror lodged in his eye. Once infected, the Snow Queen targets Cei to rebuild her magic mirror so she can destroy the other seasons and freeze the hearts of all living things to rule supreme over a world of snow and ice. Against the odds, Gerda is determined to save her friend and begins an epic journey to restore the seasons and defeat the Snow Queen.

It was into this crossfire that Rick Santorum stepped when he said the president was motivated by "some phony theology, not a theology based on the Bible." When challenged by Bob Schieffer of CBS, Santorum thinly defended his comments as references to Obama's environmental policies.

Firing a teacher for taking a picture with a drink is not advancing any particularly public policy. Rather, it is using public employment to create a subset of citizens who must not just work according to our demands but then live their lives according to our values.”

Most memorable performance: At his audition, Phillips growled his way with soul through Stevie Wonder's "Superstition" a cappella while throwing his entire body into the performance, inspiring J.Lo to say, "It's like you have electricity going through your body or something." Then, he came back and did it again on Top 13 night with a stage full of backing musicians supplying some actual electricity -- and horns! -- in a raucous arrangement that made the most of Wonder's funk groove. Imagine if Abrams had looked more like a young Matthew McConaughey and ask yourself if he could win it all.
He said the rankings that come from such things as census numbers are exactly why combining the city with St. Louis County makes sense. Such a merger would make St. Louis the eighth-largest city in the nation, tucked between San Antonio and San Diego.

Although people are certainly fallible, the fact that we make mistakes in our thinking does not mean we should simply stop making decisions. Does Ms. Mossburg mean that one person would be better than a group? This is fallacious, since sociological and anthropological research has demonstrated that people in all societies make decisions at least partially based on the norms of the community anyway. It does mean that we have to dispassionately examine facts, draw conclusions, and have open discussions of our ideas in the community and government to make decisions about the society we want.

"Bad Traffic" is a rabbit-hole that a reader is willingly sucked into, its fast pace and staccato style a preliminary enticement to deeper insights into the changing nature of Chinese mores. When thinking of his educated daughter, Jian wonders, "Was there ever such a gilded generation as the urban Chinese born in the Eighties? Their whole lives they had surfed the edge of a glorious wave of progress. . . . For them, the world could be trusted to just keep on delivering the goods. They had known nothing but bounty, so there was something green about them. They were as alien as foreigners." This sense of entitlement was built on the backs of those surviving the wreckage of the Cultural Revolution, where those in power like Inspector Jian humiliated intellectuals in the name of Mao.

David C. Troy, a software developer from Bolton Hill who filed a lawsuit last year in a failed attempt to stop Grand Prix organizers from cutting down city trees, said secrecy helped lead to the first race's financial woes. He said Downforce Racing's financial status is "germane" and in the public's interest, since the race is run on taxpayer-funded streets and in cooperation with City Hall.
Christie's auction house said Thursday that the collection beat its highest pre-sale estimate of 250,000 pounds.
The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case left a question mark over the ban on contractor giving, campaign-law experts agree. That ruling opened the floodgates to unlimited independent political spending from businesses, unions and individuals — provided they did not donate directly to, or coordinate with, the campaigns of individual candidates.
Still, driving in Italy is taking your life in your hands. Italians drive a minimum 50 m.p.h. and love to tailgate, and the traffic signs are ridiculous. We later came to find out that Italians consider traffic laws as merely suggestions.

Before long, the new park is to connect with Riverbank Park via two Newark stretches of greenery — 5.3 acres combined — along the riverfront. Newark is to break ground on the first 3.2-acre section this year, featuring a floating boat dock, in a project whose own $7 million price tag is a reflection of remediation costs.
The inference is accurate: If ASU had robust attendance for football and basketball games, there would be a different vibe in Tempe.

Manning, who will turn 36 Saturday, could only hope to end his career the way Elway did - with back-to-back Super Bowl victories. (Elway was 36 when he won his first Super Bowl.) Although the former Colts star has yet to disclose his reasons for choosing Denver, it's reasonable to think that the presence of Elway - a Hall of Fame quarterback who truly appreciates his excellence - was a big factor.

In mid-July 2008, Cindy and George Anthony were contacted by a towing yard that their daughter's car had been impounded for being abandoned and would be junked if not claimed. When George Anthony picked it up, he and the tow yard manager said it had the overwhelming stench of human decomposition. The defense said the smell was caused by a bag of trash that was in the trunk.

It's where the architects had to re-create the older design, and where those simulations meet a few remnants of the original hotel, that cracks in the logic of the campus and its attitude toward history really begin to show. The historic tile lining a preserved porte-cochere, for example, has real beauty and presence. The rebuilt spaces — the auditorium as well as the old ballroom, which has become a large library — feel hollow by comparison. In preserving architecture, as in writing history, primary sources make all the difference.

I wonder if a Brown-Stall romance was brewing in Hood's Mill a century ago, back when dating would have been much different.

The Coca Cola-braised ribs told the entire story. These succulent morsels ($11) have been a menu staple since Andalu opened in 2001 and have remained a consistent draw. Yet the complex sweetness of the dish has been replaced by an overwhelming saltiness; if I hadn't eaten them before I'd have wondered what all the fuss was about. In addition, the signature dessert of doughnut holes, served with cups of hot chocolate ($5), tasted like greasy, heavy balls of fried bread.
I'll be very honest with you. When I see them, I don't think of them as my creations. I'm watching the movie the way any fan would. I enjoy what I see. Occasionally, I'll say, 'Gee, how come I never thought of that?' if I see some great little bit of action or something that surprises me. But I'm not sitting there saying, 'Yeah, that's my creation.' I don't feel that way at all.
I'm concerned with the attitudes of our two superstars, Tulo and CarGo. I love these guys, but hear me out. CarGo's rap coming from Oakland was that he sometimes played "too cool." I've noticed a distinct lack of hustle from him in the outfield this year, like giving up on a fly ball against the wall in the ninth last night. As for Tulo, none of us can explain the errors, but did you see his failure to run out the groundball that bounced in the batter's box the other night? Could it be that he's a little too comfortable now that he's earned his rep?
Uncharacteristically, United failed to create clear chances and Hart had surprisingly little to do in the City goal.
Imagine being a Reds fan when news of Ryan Madson's season-ending Tommy John surgery flashed across the bottom of your ESPN ticker.

He'll match up with Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson, who ranks 10th among league point guards in points per game (16.4) and 11th in assists (6.6). Although Sessions has the same playoff inexperience as Lawson, the Lakers guard has appeared overmatched in defending speedy guards, such as Russell Westbrook and Tony Parker. Even Lawson's four-of-14 clip against Sessions in the Lakers' 103-97 victory April 13 to Denver featured the Nuggets guard mostly missing open shots.

Again, perhaps that’s the case because the ball is mostly in the hands of Ellis down the stretch, or in Wednesday’s case Robinson. But the other part of that is maybe neither player is injecting himself into the action enough … or at all.

Consider this fact: There are two areas in the United States that suffer from the same disease - education is one and health care is the other. They both suffer from the disease that takes a system that should be bottom-up and converts it into a system that is top-down. Education is a simple case. It isn't the public purpose to build brick schools and have students taught there. The public purpose is to provide education. Think of it this way: If you want to subsidize the production of a product, there are two ways you can do it. You can subsidize the producer or you can subsidize the consumer. In education, we subsidize the producer - the school. If you subsidize the student instead - the consumer - you will have competition. The student could choose the school he attends and that would force schools to improve and to meet the demands of their students.

Those 30 years of "Bandstand," though, were Mr. Clark's greatest musical impact, bringing a bevy of rock and pop acts into the mainstream.

In keeping with school lunch mandates, you'll need fruit and veggies to go with that. How about a big slice of Hermiston watermelon or a handful of ripe strawberries grown in Forest Grove?

Mr. O'Malley is pairing his cost shift with a proposal to limit personal exemptions and deductions for about the top 20 percent of Maryland income tax filers, and because local governments share in state income tax receipts, that will cushion the blow. The governor is also proposing to finally close a loophole that has allowed limited liability corporations to avoid transfer taxes when selling properties (a long-time priority of local governments) and is waiving a requirement that local governments help to replenish the state's income tax reserve fund, which was raided in previous state budget-balancing efforts. Because some of the state's poorer jurisdictions would still be harmed by the shift, Mr. O'Malley is also proposing to increase disparity grants.
What is the 79-year-old Widman's artistic legacy? Hull describes Widman as a visionary. That's overstatement. Rather, Widman had a vision. And as the years passed, and as new art movements emerged and flamed out, and as other artists opened and closed their studios or sank into half-heartedness, this man stuck to it without reservation.

And countries that use a common currency can't devaluate - a traditional way to deal with debt problems.
"An employer may condition a job on an employee's compliance with the employer's hair styling preferences, unless the employee's alternative hair styling preference is connected with the employee's inclusion in a protected category," Missouri Department of Labor spokeswoman Amy Susan explained in an e-mail.

Gilmer said the accusation she may have given inappropriate advice was based on a misunderstanding. She said the state's system is at fault for not locating all the applications submitted, and said it is normal for many applications to be denied for reasons that include missing information.

-- A miscommunication on offense ... Andre Miller was pointing to a spot on the floor where a Blazers teammate was supposed to be while backing down his man ... McMillan gets up off of his seat and looks hot. Not a good half for Portland thus far.
ATA's inflexibility stems from the restrictive language of its labor contract combined with federal law. The local contract prevents management from doing anything that would eliminate work done by the union, while federal law empowers the Labor Department to protect workers from a worsening of employment conditions. Any agency that finds itself crosswise with its union can be cut off from the federal grants that buy new buses.

This does not please the restaurant industry. The American Beverage Institute, a restaurant trade association, objects that the devices will be set to detect alcohol at well below the legal limit, meaning a motorist who downs a glass or two of wine at a local eatery might have to call a cab to get home. Moreover, it says the devices will sometimes fail, blocking ignition even for sober people. Those are legitimate points, and if the predictions are borne out, they might be reason enough to urge future leaders not to approve universal interlocks. But that shouldn't stop the government from researching the idea.
As everyone knows and can agree, the county is in a very tough budgetary process, and although we may, as elected officials, disagree on why, the here and now is that we are struggling.

"This was an extremely pleasant surprise to me! By all accounts most NFL Draft analysts pegged the Cincinnati defensive tackle to go on Day 3 in the 6th or 7th Round. I didn’t necessarily disagree with them but defensive linemen were going fast and furious in the opening rounds that it made it easy for Hughes to move up. Plus the 6’2″ 309 lbs defensive tackle is excellent against the run.

They say it’s suspicious that the tissue around her mouth does not appear to be damaged, and that it was the veneers, not the teeth, that were broken. (Wait, that sounds familiar ... oh, yes. Ashley Holmes claiming on "Real Housewives of New Jersey" that, "technically," she didn't pull Danielle Staub's hair, she pulled her hair extensions, "so it's really not a part of her." Anyway!)

Romney and his "friends in Congress think the same bad ideas will lead to a different result, or they're just hoping you won't remember what happened the last time you tried it their way," the president told an audience estimated at over 10,000 supporters at Ohio State University in Columbus.
The dollar amount is what caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. How Columbus might use the money is purely speculative. We wanted to know if such savings would even exist, especially since more general statements are sometimes made without taking into consideration the fact that many public employees already are contributing significantly toward their pensions.

3John Cleland's novel about a young woman's erotic adventures, first published 2½ centuries ago, was banned in Britain until the 1960s. Deservedly so, if you believe in obscenity laws. And the book certainly ignores the darker side of prostitution in 18th-century London. But as a candid study of human sexuality in its infinite variety, "Fanny Hill" can't be beaten. Fanny, who tells her story in a series of letters, begins as a virtuous young woman and ends up, through no fault of her own, in a London brothel that doubles as a hat shop. Her career, though lurid by any measure, is nevertheless recounted in prose that captures the rhythms of 18th-century spoken English as well as the riotous permissiveness of the age. She vows "to paint situations as they actually arose to me in nature, careless of violating those laws of decency, that were never made for such unreserved intimacies as ours." This book will incense some readers, but Fanny's character is so human, and her attitude to her experiences so essentially sane (and, yes, pleasure-loving), that perhaps Cleland should be forgiven his effrontery in creating her.
Here's where I realized that water could, indeed, splash up onto my neck and chin during the trip. I don't know why I thought I was going to be in an airtight uniform suitable for space travel. Nope, the helmet rests on your shoulders, and there's room for water to head for your head. The compressed air does the trick and keeps all at bay.

The city's new water law also offers a taste of what's to come if the statewide drought - already in its third year - continues to worsen. It allows the city in the future to order across-the-board cutbacks from every customer - and to limit water flow to those who don't comply.

That's not to say there's a fast or easy fix to problems that have been building for decades.

The Coterie Theatre production of “James and the Giant Peach,” an adaptation of a 1961 novel by Roald Dahl, is an agreeable mix of low-tech gags and over-the-top performances. But before I go any further I should mention the costumes. Designer Lauren Roark, a graduate student in the UMKC Theater Department, has come up with some wildly inventive, aggressively colorful outfits for her actors that become an integral part of the show. The costumes, independent of what the actors may do, produce some of the biggest laughs.

The difficulties are especially acute for French-language authors from ex-colonial countries like Vietnam, Cameroon, Chad and the Canadian province of Quebec, said UCLA's Thomas. Since World War II, France's haute literary establishment has been dominated by theorists and critics who cherish the cerebral experimental texts of bad-boy authors like Michel Houellebecq ('"The Elementary Particles") over more narrative fiction. French universities also give short shrift to French-language authors from outside France.

Parkinson's disease: With this progressive, neurological illness, it's the caffeine, not coffee, that carries the benefit. No one knows for sure why caffeine protects. Several studies show that coffee drinkers, men especially, appear to have half the risk of Parkinson's compared with nondrinkers. Women also get a benefit, but only those who do not use post-menopausal hormones, said Dr. Alberto Ascherio, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. All it takes for a measurable reduction in Parkinson's risk, he said, is about 150 milligrams a day, the amount in an average cup of coffee.

How successful these bombs have been in taking out their targets is unknown; rebels can provide only a few videos to back up their claims of destroying multiple tanks and killing dozens of government thugs. In one video uploaded in early March, two explosions go off as a tank drives along a highway.

Romney's comments during the Florida event, in which he said "I'm going to take a lot of departments in Washington, and agencies, and combine them,” touched on the Department of Education, the role of union money in campaigns and details of his tax plans.

øThe vibe: A weekend of individual activities and group breakfasts and parties, including the most important bash of them all: the wedding, but the guests - and kids - wouldn't know when they were saying "I do" until the moment it happens. The ceremony itself? A stripped-down affair "definitely" devoid of bridesmaids, groomsmen attendants, ring bearers and wedding cake - "none of that foolishness." The cuisine, whipped up by private chefs from different regions of the world, would pay homage to the children's homelands, from Africa to Southeast Asia. The décor would be "very sleek, very clean": teak furnishings, neutral fabrics, seagrass mats - no "ugly white vinyl" tents. The goal? For guests to "walk away with a greater appreciation for something bigger than the USA."

Brown has been describing his temporary sales and income tax increases as necessary to protect schools and public safety. But a new report on school finance from the Legislature's budget analyst, Mac Taylor, makes it clear that even were Brown's taxes to be increased, his budget would continue to reduce California's per-pupil spending. Virtually all of the school money in the package would just pay schools what the state already owes them.

That insecurity was present when he and Lloyd Webber began work on "Superstar." The title, inspired by an ad for a Tom Jones concert, was so off-putting that no theatrical producer in London or New York would touch the show, and so they first made the now-classic concert recording. When the songs, especially "I Don't Know How to Love Him," became global hits, Broadway came calling.

I am would like to say something to those religious folks who are fighting against gay marriage.
