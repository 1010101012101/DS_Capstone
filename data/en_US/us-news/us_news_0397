What high school sports mean to me: High school sports are a lot of fun. I enjoy them. Some of the tournaments during the year don't have that deep of a field or aren't the biggest, but they're still a lot of fun. It's great playing on a team. It's definitely something I'll take into college, learning how to play on a team in a sport that is already individual.

Art collector Peter Silverman had such a jolting recognition concerning a painting he saw in the late 1990s and again at a New York City auction in 2007. He was convinced it must have been executed by the one and only Renaissance master from Vinci — a story he relates, with Catherine Whitney, in "Leonardo's Lost Princess: One Man's Quest to Authenticate an Unknown Portrait by Leonardo da Vinci" (Wiley: 256 pp., $25.95).

People would have inevitably started fires with candles. They’d have injured themselves with flying glass or trying to “rescue” themselves after it was too late, running out in flooded streets to seek shelter. Police, fire and federal resources would have gone just where they did in Katrina -- rescuing people who should have left, rather than safeguarding an empty city and starting recovery.
The French air traffic controllers are upset about plans to integrate European air traffic operations, leaving them to face new work rules, the loss of their civil servant benefits or even job cuts. British Airways cabin crews don't want the company to slash the number of employees working on flights.
It was a subtle but commanding kick, as Monyenye's lead stretched to 100 yards, then several hundred. He later said he knew as soon as he broke that the rest of the field would not catch him, not even feeling compelled over the final miles to glance back over his shoulder.

Though open-government advocates called the bill a good step forward, it fell short of expectations set when it was introduced in the aftermath of state Sen. Ulysses Currie's public corruption trial.

Ironically, the first year Maryland didn't make the tournament after Dickerson's return to his alma mater, he got his first head coaching job at Tulane.

The national anthem touts our nation as the "land of the free" and politicians define us as "freedom-loving." Indeed, the term "freedom" most aptly describes who we claim to be, doesn't it? It would seem, then, that Americans should be the experts on this topic. Not a week goes by that we don't hear someone praising those who lost their lives to preserve the freedoms we are told we cherish. But, do we? I challenge you to turn to your coffee-klatch buddies and seriously discuss what it means to you. You may find the answer more elusive than you think.

On an early date, Ms. Gabbay got a peek at Mr. O'Sullivan's then-unfinished home and said she was impressed by his thoughtfulness in creating spaces for kids and a wife.

Every time I hear the Affordable Care Act derisively called "Obamacare," I get mad. Candidate Barack Obama promised health insurance reform, and President Obama pushed for it and, yes, took credit for the resulting law. But he didn't dictate what would be approved by members of Congress, whom I guess we're supposed to consider merely his puppets and automatons. He was even disparaged for his early disengagement from the drafting process.

Prices seem a little out of whack, too. I'm still wondering why the hand- chopped steak tartare is only $14 for what looks to be about a half-pound portion of prime meat.

Several aspects of multiple sclerosis are consistent, though, such as chronic fatigue and patients' extreme sensitivity to heat. Couples facing MS have an exceptionally high divorce rate. The issue got some high-profile attention a few years ago when the character of the "President on The West Wing" was given MS by his scriptwriters, and I hope it helped to boost awareness.
Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen), a sponsor of the Medicaid expansion bill, said if what the video shows is accurate, "obviously this Planned Parenthood clinic needs to get rid of any inappropriate employees and make sure the employees they retain are property trained on the law."

It was widely reported that Lady Gaga had released "Judas" on Good Friday. This is not true. "Judas" was released on April 15 — a week before Easter weekend. Furthermore, reports of the song’s sacrilegious content are exaggerated. "Judas" has very little to do with Christianity. It’s a typical "smart women/foolish choices" pop complaint about a lousy boyfriend who the narrator can’t bring herself to ditch. Remember that bad romance she was caught in? She’s still there.

He camouflaged the components and cables behind smoked glass doors. The look is sleek and custom.

I had to think twice to be sure I had a reservation because the place looked unprepared for diners. About 20 people crowded around the bar, but the exhibition kitchen was dark; no one was at the grill or the stove. My mind reeled: Is this only a bar? Do they have a full menu?

Legalizing possession and production would eliminate many of the problems related to drug dealing, but it would certainly worsen the problem of drug abuse. We could abolish the illicit market in cocaine, as we abolished the illicit market in alcohol, but does anyone consider our current alcohol policies a success?

At 33.4 miles, we get a long, pretty tough climb with a very straight descent where it's easy to get going over 40 mph. Don't let the straightaway lure you into a false sense of security. Unlike us, the pros ride on closed courses, so they can fly down as fast as they dare. We have to worry about cars pulling out of driveways or side streets  and those tiny brakes on road bikes just don't work very well.

The firing upon and surrender of Ft. Sumter 150 years ago this month began the heroic but tragic epic war that would cost the lives of 620,000 people — as many as all of our other wars put together. The editors' selection of seven documents that allow us to hear the responses to Ft. Sumter are a microcosm of what the reader can expect in this anthology. We look over the shoulder of Mary Chestnut, who, from inside her Charleston hotel room, confides her Southern response to this momentous event in the pages of her diary.

For the first time, defendant Will Lynch's attorney publicly conceded that his client pummeled the Rev. Jerold Lindner two years ago at the Sacred Heart retirement and medical center in Los Gatos.

The document is a major step toward making Monah's dream come true: a Christian school for children who usually don't have a prayer for much formal education.
Jerusalem's Arab residents, who make up about one-third of the city's population, are suffering from a growing housing crunch.

Young had falsely claimed paternity of Edwards' daughter with Hunter as the politician dismissed the stories as "tabloid trash" while campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Still, most parents were remarkably calm, praising the school in general and saying they felt confident any wrongdoing would be punished and their kids would be safe. As I worked the scene with my video camera throughout the day, I interviewed about fifteen parents and grandparents. Two were very angry about what had happened. Yes, two out of fifteen. The rest sounded like like Cheryl Reid Randolph, grandmother of first grade twins who told me: "You know, I found out something. You wait. You wait until you have all the facts because a half a truth is a lie."

There are no televisions in the bedrooms, but there are old-school radios for tuning in to Classic FM or Radio 4; guests are encouraged to watch movies in the residents' sitting rooms.
NCAA President Mark Emmert acknowledged the system needs an overhaul . . . but to what? If athletes were required to sign a four-year, non-guaranteed contract, then schools would have all the power. If no commitment is involved, the recruiting process would never end. Add in the fact that the transfer rate of men's basketball players -- 40 percent, according to Emmert -- isn't significantly higher than it is for all students -- 33 percent -- and it's clear there is no easy solution.

You may have heard about the Catholic church's stand against a Health and Human Services policy that will require religious institutions (not churches) to provide provide health insurance to their employees which includes subsidized contraception, sterilization and coverage for abortion-inducing drugs.

I think Obama miscalculated on that one, and I pray that the church will continue to stiffen it's spine and resist this overreach.

3. PROMOTE CHOICE AND INNOVATION. Whether a public school performs well or badly, it basically keeps students in that neighborhood, because most families have no other choice. This monopoly leaves no incentive to innovate to improve performance and efficiency -- inducements as vital to public schools as they are elsewhere. Families with more means can choose private schools, can move to another town or can otherwise navigate the system. Those families who are least powerful, however, remain trapped. To support choice and innovation, we need to provide real funding equity and ensure that money follows children, not schools. Child-centered funding would give entrepreneurial educators the ability to reimagine how teachers and students do their work, and to compete to serve families with breakthrough pedagogical tools that creatively tap new learning technologies.
While it surely infuriated many of us to see McGwire testify before Congress and dodge every question about whether he used performance-enhancing drugs to become baseball's celebrated home run king, ultimately it saved McGwire's hide.

As for civil unions, didn't we, as a country, already decide that "separate but equal" was not, in fact, equal? Civil unions do not allow for the same rights as marriage, and if you were to give civil unions the same rights as marriage, why not just call it marriage?

Things get more interesting in the new version, with Ke$ha enlisting an A-list quartet of MCs who supercharge the song. The rappers include T.I., Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa, as well as Andre 3000 from Outkast. All, except for Andre, try to boast their ways into Ke$ha’s, let’s say, heart, with claims of Kama Sutra swagger and Fort Knox (rather than hard knocks) accomplishments. Andre 3000’s rap is the most wholesome, about a kid coming to grips with a deadbeat dad, and Lil Wayne, whose nickname is Weezy, gets slightly sleazy for his double entendre-filled boudoir boasts.

No, I don't think so. Millenials are developing their religious systems and all honest Christians go through seasons of questioning orthodoxy to determine what they actually believe so that they can actually live it. So, I would say that almost everyone thinks about this, but not in a conclusive way. I think they are exploring it, and I think in the end evangelical Millenials will settle in on a historically, orthodox position for logical reasons, if for no other reasons.

"We have to realize he's still a human being (and) he can have a bad game (or) he can have a great game.

The notion that the U.S. would be able to impose conditions on Mr. Chen's release in China was always optimistic, given the Communist Party's long history of seeking to destroy its political opponents rather than engage them.

Sweeney said under Christie’s budget, seniors would have to pay an average of $2,000 extra from the loss of their rebates and increased co-pays for prescription drugs.

The bookseller was acquitted. We expert witnesses puffed ourselves up with pride. Barney insisted on a grand party for the jury (have I mentioned that he spent his money wildly?). The jury chairman, his breath aromatic with tasty tidbits, informed us that, for example, my explanations to the district attorney, judge and jury - a character's dialogue in a novel does not necessarily represent the author's own beliefs - were irrelevant in the verdict.

In Maryland — one of the bluest states in the nation — officials might perceive that there is little risk at the ballot box. Moreover, the state's history of corruption seems to have made voters less sensitive to ethical lapses, political observers say. Over the past 50 years, major figures have been involved in state political scandals, including Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, forced out of office in a bribery case dating to his days as Baltimore County executive, and former Gov. Marvin Mandel, who went to prison in a mail fraud and racketeering case but whose conviction was later overturned.
