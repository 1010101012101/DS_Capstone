On the day before the president-elect's inauguration, any mention of Obama guaranteed a chorus of fierce claps.
** Brodus Clay's match with Jack Swagger was more than a squash, so I appreciate that. But now it seems Clay is in a holding pattern facing Ziggler and Swagger, and I wonder what they payoff to this angle will be. The worrisome thing is that Ziggler is becoming pigeon-holed into a supporting role because of his amazing ability to sell. Look at the way Ziggler took Clay's headbutt; you would have thought someone shot him.
$2,675,000: 1999 Double Eagle LP, a Texas limited partnership with William A. Jackson of Arcadia, Okla., as principal, paid cash for a three-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath, 5,460-square-foot Mediterranean estate at Morton Mesa in Paradise Valley. The home is on a hillside on nearly an acre and a third.

But McGwire, perhaps the most significant face of baseball's dramatic dip into pharmaceutical performance enhancements, has quietly blended into the scenery. No longer a pariah, Big Mac is now just another baseball solid citizen, going about his duties as the Cardinals' hitting coach with little notice or fanfare and not a hint of the controversy that dogged him when he was in self-imposed exile.

A: It never quite works out that way. What happens is I'm lucky that there's like a firewall in my brain between these projects. In the last week I've worked on something about rock and roll in the late '60s, a Russian guy poisoned with polonium in London a couple of years ago, the Rosenberg case and something set in a Tasmanian penal colony in 1820. While you're in that world, you're in that world.

Well, look at the history of jazz and the role that it played in instilling hope for freedom during the second World War. In a film I was involved in, "'Round Midnight," one of the main characters was this Frenchman who had gone to war, and jazz was the music that saved him. What happened was he went AWOL, and his whole troop got wiped out, but he's alive because he left. And he attributes jazz to saving his life.... People feel the freedom in the music.
I suggested you contact Budget by e-mail, asking for the evidence you had returned the car late. A representative sent you a terse reply, insisting that "based on the log records," you returned the car at 8:56 p.m., long after you were airborne. It seems to me that a simple copy of your flight itinerary would have been enough to clear up this apparent misunderstanding.
Those accomplishments may now be in jeopardy. This week the Supreme Court, which twice has upheld the constitutionality of some racial preferences in university admissions, agreed to hear a challenge to the University of Texas' use of race as one factor in a "holistic" admissions policy. This comes nine years after the court, in an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, ruled that it was constitutional for the University of Michigan Law School to pursue a similar policy in pursuit of a "critical mass" of minority enrollment necessary to promote a wide exchange of views in the classroom. But since then O'Connor has been replaced by JusticeSamuel A. Alito Jr., who is regarded as more skeptical of racial preferences. Advocates of affirmative action fear that conservatives on the court are determined to overturn or gut the court's 2003 Michigan decision and the 1978 Bakke decision before it, which held that race could be considered as a "plus" factor in the admissions process so long as there were not fixed racial quotas.

If Assad again breaks his word, the "Friends of Syria" will "continue to work on additional appropriate measures with a view to the protection of the Syrian people." Some assistance is already in the works. Arab nations, for instance, will pay resistance fighters and perhaps provide arms.

More generally, Clinton warned that there would be "serious consequences" if violence by the regime continued.
Cageao's comeback is another chapter in a career that has been without peer, and is part of Northeast Ohio's rich wrestling legacy. His 34 state tournaments is believed to be a record for officials. Though he has not been voted by coaches as a state tournament official since 2008, he was regarded as the state's top official for decades, and in 1987 was named Official of the Year by the U.S. Wrestling Officials Association. His knowledge, fairness and accuracy rarely are questioned.
Miranda's propulsive score that skips from salsa to hip-hop in a flash and Andy Blankenbuehler's incendiary choreography give the 2008 Tony winner for best musical its infectious sense of joy. Unfortunately, on second viewing, the show's sometimes corny plot is more evident than before.

Thus I get seriously choked up when I hear Annakin Slayd’s “Remember,” his tribute to his hometown team, which shrewdly samples “Gathering Crowds.” Montreal doesn’t have a ballclub anymore: The Expos, who I always had a soft spot for, have moved south to Washington, where they’re drafting high and hoping for the best. Annakin Slayd is a sports-rapper (he also does a song about the Montreal Canadiens, which, less imaginatively, samples “Don’t Stop Believin’’) who probably grew up when I did. I’m sure he remembers the pre-ESPN era, and I imagine that his relationship to his club was mediated by the same forces that shaped mine: staticky radio, Topps picture cards, shoddily written preview issues in fly-by-night magazines, Games of the Week on television, and occasional golden trips to the ballpark. The Expos never won anything, but their near-misses – many of which are inscribed in Slayd’s verse – are part of Canadian baseball lore. They were in first place when the 1994 strike wiped out the rest of the season. A rap about a ballclub might sound silly to those with no passion for the horsehide, but he doesn’t have to explain a thing to me. The pain in this song is as real as The Game, or Leonard Cohen, or “Everybody Hurts.”

The polymer covering theoretically also would be able to reduce the risk of inflammation in surrounding tissue and contain drugs to help detect and kill cancer cells.

The World War I death of her 18-year-old son Peter, killed within a month after he enlisted, marked her work from then on. Her most powerful piece about war seems to anticipate her grief. Done in 1907, it is a centerpiece of her series "The Peasants' Revolt" about a 1525 uprising. Most of the peasants were killed, of course, and in "The Battlefield," she depicts a mother searching for the body of her child in the darkness, the only light illuminating her gnarled fingers as she lifts the chin of a corpse.

Howard Garber discusses his views on the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II in a rebuttal. Garber states that “Internment camps were exclusively for enemy aliens with charges . . . Japanese Americans could not legally be interned.” However, more than 110,000 people of Japanese heritage were forcibly interned under Executive Order 9066: two-thirds of these individuals were American citizens. This included my third-generation, Japanese-American mother and her family who spent four years in a Colorado internment camp watching the guards above them with machine guns and living within the barbed wire fences.

Rape is not a sexual act. It's an act of violence, an act of dominance, an act of one person exerting their will and their need for something over the rights of another. It's terrible, and it needs to feel that way, and the audience needs to feel it that way. It would be irresponsible not to feel that. So that becomes our responsibility, and we need to show that. To do it in an unflinching way is kind of the task at hand.

Check the calendar at the website to help you pick an upcoming event. On weeknights during happy hour, you will likely see local friends and state workers watching a game and having an after-work drink.

* The first is a bridge, where you lie on your back with your feet on the floor, legs bent and push your hips up to the ceiling while squeezing the glutes. The activation of the glute muscles sends a signal to the hip flexors to relax, and it allows them to lengthen. Push the hips up on a one-two count, hold for about a second, and take about three to four seconds to come down. Do that about 12 to 15 times, and really emphasize the contraction of the glutes.

But if you want some fun for free indoors, it's possible. My first suggestion might shock you. The library is a great place for free fun (so long as you aren't late with your returns). Many teens are quick to turn their noses up at the library because reading is often thought of as work. I have been assigned my fair share of reading in school and do not always look for extra reading in my spare time. But there are plenty of great books at the library you can indulge in without having to worry about themes or symbolism. Also, literature is not the only thing the library has to offer. DVDs of movies and TV shows are also available.

"Knocked Up" abounds with fine performances: Judd Apatow's skill as a writer is matched by his direction of actors. Of the several cast members previously seen in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and/or Mr. Apatow's late lamented TV series "Freaks and Geeks," the most prominent are the filmmaker's wife, Leslie Mann, and Paul Rudd. They play Allison's sister, Debbie, and her husband, Pete, whose married life is a no-fun-house-mirror version of what Ben and Allison's alliance might be. Indeed, it's a tacitly grim, as well as hilarious, picture of a couple struggling to make their marriage work, just as Ben and his achievement-free buds are a sharply comic reflection of American adolescence as a lifelong career. Yet the movie's big heart isn't in criticizing the way people live. "Knocked Up" has a more hopeful outlook on life, and on Ben's and Allison's prospects. Of all things, it's a paean to family values.

Everywhere I go in this campaign, I meet Americans who are really suffering in the Obama Economy. You can see it on their faces and hear it in their voices  they are anxious and scared about the future. Ive met moms and dads who are struggling to get by.

Ive met kids who are about to graduate college; theyre facing student loans and a bad economy, and they are worried that they wont be able to get a job. Everywhere I go, I hear stories that serve as sad reminders of this failed presidency.

Pausa, as owners Einat and Avigdor Rothem call it, is a getaway place for Israeli foodies, surrounded by collective farms, or kibbutzim. Set among orange and olive groves, near 9,232-foot Mt. Hermon and the headwaters of the Jordan, it promised fine food in a bucolic setting as long as all remained quiet on the nearby Lebanese border. This was a flash point for hostilities between Israel and the pro-Palestinian Hezbollah in 2006, when bombs rained down on the Pausa garden.

Nor should we think we can rely on innovation and geo-engineering to stop acidification. Some have suggested sunshades for the Earth, but that will neither repair the oceans' chemistry nor reverse the changes that have occurred thus far, let alone protect against our continuing release of carbon dioxide. Another suggested antidote -- deliberately modifying the oceans' microbial cycles of carbon and oxygen so as to interrupt acidification and allow us to continue our current fossil fuel addiction -- would be an act of hubris and desperation. We have a clear and attainable alternative: making electricity without releasing carbon dioxide.

That tune "just captures you," says Cohen. "It has everything in it -- very emotional and grooving at the same time. Perfect music."

His expertise was trading futures tied to baskets of stocks such as the Euro Stoxx 50. In normal markets, some $40 billion to $50 billion of the futures of that index trade daily.

Mr. Kerviel also made trades in Germany's DAX Index and France's CAC-40.

Rivard predicts that noise pollution will continue to affect more and more people, in part due to refashioned building codes.

A nonnative species, they were introduced to the Everglades and now the population there is estimated in the tens of thousands. In 2008, the National Park Service removed and destroyed 311 of the snakes.

Other reptiles of concern are the Indian python, reticulated python, African rock python, amethystine or scrub python, green anaconda and Nile monitor lizard. Burmese pythons, like all reptiles of concern, must be licensed by the state in order to be kept as pets. The license costs $100 per year and mandates specific caging requirements. Burmese pythons more than 2 inches in diameter must be implanted with a microchip that identifies the animal.

These groups and their volunteers understand the importance of this history more than anyone else. They and the city's preservation commission — the city agency charged with overseeing historic preservation in Baltimore — must be at the center of any consideration for their future.

To get around the Republican secretary of state's order, FitzGerald promised to send out the requests through a county agency not under his Husted's control.

Ohio enacted a law in 2009 requiring drivers to turn on the headlights when windshield wipers are in use. The idea is to make vehicles a bit more visible in the drizzle. Judging by recent e-mails to Road Rant after rainy days, it seems some people didn't quite get the message. If that's you, consider this a reminder to brighten up.
Joyce, who earned a reputation as beyond tough during 12 years in the National Football League -- including a year with the expansion Minnesota Vikings -- might have replied that he came from an era when players gladly took on such challenges for next to nothing. In fact, he himself was the target of a small bounty in the 1950s because of his ability to single-handedly change the course of a game.
It seems from what I have read that St. Louis' problem is that they are unable to attract well-educated motivated young people. I have read many of the articles posted here over the past couple of months, and I still don't see any truly actionable ideas. (And the article about having St. Louis parties to try to get people to move back strikes me as a silly idea. Who is going to move back if they can't find a job?) Why is St. Louis not just going out to Google or Microsoft and trying to attract some of these big tech companies?
The first year, Parker said, he was a terrible teacher. He could relate to the kids, but he had no sense of how to manage a classroom, and he would let his emotions and temper get the better of him. He remembers chewing out a girl one day because she talked endlessly. At the end of it, she laughed at him, and he realized he had to change his strategy.

"We go to the film room and any film session would be a very sobering experience," U-M senior Stu Douglass said. "You're playing all right and there could be double-digit mistakes that you made in the entire game you don't even realize sometimes. You got to put pride aside and grow up a little bit, just take responsibility for your own actions and move on. ... Maturity and growing up and the experience we had last year has helped us a lot."

Trusts would be seeded with a core allocation that each sub-basin would use to kick-start its collaborative planning, goal-setting and initial habitat-improvement efforts. They would then sign on to measurable improvements over specific time periods. If they reach those milestones, their trusts would be replenished.

"After about an hour of discussing my current contract, as well as the contracts of other defensive ends currently playing in the National Football League, Mr. Reese told me that two years from the start of the 2008 league year, if I was currently playing at a high level, we'd either renegotiate my current contract so that it would be equal to that of the top five defensive ends playing or I would be traded to a team that would do that.

With a willing General Assembly -- stress on "willing" -- and assuming a governor doesn't worry about re-election, there's not much an Ohio governor can't do. And if voters make Kasich governor, there's a good chance they'd also give Ohio a Republican-run state House of Representatives, led by Medina conservative William G. Batchelder. But changing the Statehouse's population doesn't change Ohio's population.

If the law survives court challenges and shrinks the illegal-immigrant population in Arizona, it would benefit some workers and unemployed people but also would hurt certain businesses that rely on illegal-immigrant labor or customers.

We knew that if we could get them here, and they understood our personalities and our facility, it would help them to really assess if this was a place they would like to have a meeting. We'd have between 12 to 16 guests on weekends on our fishing boat, going to wineries and participating in group dinners. We wanted to remind them of the importance of networking after meetings when you're captured on a campus setting. Most either brought us a meeting or they're planning one in the future.

Granted, it might be too much to expect negotiators to produce a sweeping grand bargain that might, against all odds, capture enough votes in the House and Senate to actually be adopted. Indeed, it's hard to believe any compromise plan could pass the House these days, given Mr. Norquist's iron-fisted rule when it comes to Republicans and tax increases.

That's 30 percent fewer than the same month last year - shortly before the so-called "robo-signing" scandal came to light and banks slowed down foreclosure proceedings. It is, however, the second-highest monthly count in 2011, and the second-straight with more than 1,500.

Civilian courts across the country have acknowledged the fact that, after a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, some veterans' crimes can be traced back to battle-zone trauma — and that they shouldn't go to jail or prison for them.

But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people, and allows investment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. That is why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open-ended - because the nation that I am most interested in building is our own.

I applaud the zoning commission for including the residents on East 108th Street and notifying them of the decisions made without their knowledge.

Puro Sabor: On weekends, Puro Sabor (Spanish for "pure flavor") serves Peruvian-style breakfasts — meaty, farmhand-style meals built around steaks, eggs and tacu tacu, the Afro-Peruvian mash-up of seasoned rice and beans. The sweetest spot is held by picarones, melt-in-the-mouth pumpkin doughnuts that resemble tempura-light funnel cakes. Drizzled with syrup made from dark, earthy piloncillo sugar, the dessert exemplifies yet again why Puro Sabor is so apt as the restaurant's name.

To this day, Holm does not regret that he extended his prison time by maintaining his innocence. "The worst part of my sentence was the accusation," he said. "It wasn't being told I was going to stay in a 9-by-5 cell for the next five years. It's the fact that I was unjustly accused and unjustly convicted of a crime I would never do. I was far more concerned with the truth being established than I was with my freedom."

As such, it's clever. It deftly channels the sentiment underlying Occupy Wall Street (original version, before its slovenly, whiny, aggressive weirdness made it politically toxic). It perfectly pits the 99 percent against the 1 percent. Indeed, it is OWS translated into legislation, something the actual occupiers never had the wit to come up with.

Democrats, however, claimed the repeal does not reset election laws.

Admit it. We all have plants that tempt us. (You're "just looking" in a greenhouse or nursery but can't help bringing home a lovely new specimen.) One plant in this category is the tuberous begonia. After a long, dull winter, they shout out with lush flowers and foliage in strikingly bright, clear colors. Tuberous begonias are frost-sensitive plants grown from tubers. They need bright light but no direct sun. Upright forms are perfect for pots. When placed in evenly moist, well-drained soil and fertilized monthly, they bloom happily all summer long. Two different flower forms occur on each plant: double flowers are male, and single flowers are female. Tuberous begonias have thick, succulent stems that need support as they grow. Use a stake and tie toward the outer side of the pot to protect the tuber. At the end of the season, toss or overwinter in a greenhouse.
