US-Pakistan relations were already on the rocks before this latest ISI-Haqqani twist -- not to mention yesterday’s report of a deadli Pakistani army attack on US soldiers in 2007 on the Afghan border.

Peter Chalk, a senior political analyst with Rand Corp. think tank, said the U.S. gifting of old hardware is a mixed blessing for the Philippines, as it is responsible for the upkeep and getting spare parts is difficult.

Then-incumbent Jon Corzine and his allies were critical of Marra and accused him of being too close with Christie and using the federal prosecutor’s office to further Christie’s campaign. Marra was also the subject of a complaint filed with the U.S. Justice Department, which alleged Marra made comments during a news conference after the July 23 arrests that may have helped Christie’s campaign.

One run scored on the throwing error, the first score of any kind for the hapless Twins in the previous 25 innings — which included being no-hit by the Angels’ Jered Weaver in their previous game on Wednesday.

He’s not too far gone to ask for a helping hand. But West, as we’re reminded on the self-flagellating "Runaway," has serious trouble with intimacy.

On “Hell of a Life,” a few rhymes after marrying a porn star, bride and groom are both screwing the bridesmaids. “Devil in a New Dress” is the coldest party you’ll ever attend — name-dropping fashionistas, bullies with loose change, and West’s endless stream of invective directed at a woman who won’t talk back.

Some say it's unfair to have 32 of 72 schools in the new Division I playoffs, while 32 of about 108 make it in the other six divisions. Hogwash.

Think of the impact you have when an employee of yours goes home with pride in the job they've done, feeling respected and valued, and with the ability to support themselves and their family. There is no end to the good you have done. And they, in turn, help you succeed.

Critics of LNG export say the export model is a holy grail opportunity for the gas industry, and not just because it offers access to new customers.

Now Ms. Cholodenko has joined the party with yet another terrific film that bears the indelible stamp of a woman, and an American woman at that. "Party" may not be the right word, though. It's starting to feel like a home-grown renaissance.

Hey, Tony: I took a hard game-by-game look at the 2010 St. Louis Rams to try to make sense of what is happening to our Browns. What was evident was that the same exact problems that McCoy is having now happened to Sam Bradford in 2010. Blogs were screaming about the inept play-calling by Shurmur, Bradford's inaccuracy, that they never threw the ball down field and never used Stephen Jackson. For 2010 Bradford had an average per attempt of only 5.95 yards. You have been very critical of McCoy and that he is the sole reason for our problems but based on everything considered I believe Pat Shurmur is in way over his head and McCoy will continue to struggle and be blamed. -- George Schmidt, Cleveland

Closer to the church, spectators have left cars all over, along red painted curbsides, in driveways, in loading zones, abandoned at the center of the road. Those of us circling for parking places are told to move on. Since the streets have quickly heated up, the 24-hour vigil has been cancelled. Praying in public tonight is too dangerous. I smell alcohol in the air, strong, oozing out of broken glass that has met the pavement. Then come the stones. Random. They thud against the thin metal of my car. Random, I slowly understand, we're in the heat of chaos.

At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is OK.

Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

Those are the working conditions the labor movement initially rose to combat. Still, UMSL's Rogers argues that organized labor has basically achieved the core principles that dictated the birth of the movement in the 1920s and 1930s - primarily providing members with livable wages along with adequate and safe working conditions. Now, he contends, the time may be ripe for unions to turn the focus on improving quality in the companies that provide their members with paychecks.

In many ways, state government is a superseding democratic authority to local governments, and that is the entire impetus behind the emergency manager law. It exists to stop local governments from spending themselves into oblivion, wreaking financial havoc directly on state government and indirectly on local governments from the Ohio border to the tip of the Keweenaw. Its authority derives from the responsibility state government has to protect all Michigan citizens.

-- Unless the price is prohibitive, buy TCI that includes a "cancel for any reason" provision. If a more typical policy doesn't specify "civil unrest" as a "named peril," for example, the policy wouldn't cover you if you decided to cancel a trip to Greece because you're worried about street demonstrations. "Any reason" coverage means you make the go/no go decision, not an insurance company bean counter.

Order. Simply put, order counts and communicates what the candidate thinks is important. Consider section order in a résumé. After a summary or objectives, most résumés begin with education, experience or skills. The section you choose to start with will be perceived to be your area of greatest strength.

Make deliberate decisions about section order because it must correlate with the employer’s perception of the job.

For whatever reason, I only feel comfortable reselling or consigning shopping duds that have stuck around a while. I don't give up easily on challenging items and prefer to have several rounds of battle with them before admitting defeat. But once it becomes clear that something simply won't work for my style or figure, and if it has any resale value whatever, I'll hit up my consignment haunts. I have two main reselling criteria: Excellent condition and recognizable brand name.
"It's tough," Brodeur said. "Especially when it's a tie game like that and you know the next shot is going to be the shot that could make a difference, like tonight, to send us home. When you don't get many shots your mind starts wandering a little bit. It gets tough.

Hanauer knew little about starting a nonprofit, but she knew what she wanted: a workplace like the one she had just left in Wisconsin. Launching such a venture was perhaps naive, but her timing proved impeccable.
"Ginjinha" is one of my favorite Portuguese drinks. This sweet liqueur is made from the sour, cherry–like ginja berry, sugar, and alcohol. It's sold for less than $2 a shot in funky old shops throughout Portugal. Buy it with or without berries ("com elas" or "sem elas" — that's "with them" or "without them") and "gelada" (if you want it poured from a chilled bottle — very nice).
Rice was being diplomatic, but I won't be. It was a bogus call, especially at that juncture in the game. And if LaMarr Woodley plays next week and he sacks Joe Flacco at a crucial moment in the game, no referee should care if he pumps his fist or thumps his chest. If I wanted polite celebrations, I'd watch more golf.

When it's triple digits and you're looking for distraction, try stepping outside the wine box. We're all in the habit of choosing wines we know and love, and there's nothing wrong with the simple pleasure of an expectation fulfilled. But try wandering the store, browsing for the more unusual wines, the ones with the interesting names or just plain visual appeal. You might encounter disappointment (don't break the bank during this experiment), and you might encounter elation. You might swear "never again," or you might latch on to a new favorite that you can't wait to share with friends.

The Padaung people, commonly known as the long-necked women, are refugees from Myanmar (also known as Burma) who are famous for their giraffelike appearance, which is caused by brass rings coiled around their necks. Although it looks like the coils thrust their necks upward, the elongation is actually caused by the weight of the rings crushing their collarbones down. Ever since I glimpsed the Padaung as a child in my grandfather's National Geographics, I had wanted to see these curious women, who suffer painful disfigurement to emerge as graceful beauties.

Rose, who had missed 12 consecutive games with a groin injury, played for the first time on Sunday against the New York Knicks, who squeaked past the Bulls 100-99 in overtime. In December, Rose signed a five-year, $94.8 million contract extension with the Bulls and a $260 million Adidas endorsement deal. So Pampers will not be a problem!

If Baylor conquers Kansas on Monday, the Bears will have survived the second of what's shaping up to be its three most difficult tests of the season, battles at Kansas State, KU and Missouri.

She called for major changes in DWP's management, saying, "The environmental goal of generating renewable energy is too important to continue funding mediocre and failed 'experiments.' The public deserves to know about these programs and how their money is being spent." The architect of those failed experiments was former DWP General Manager S.

What happened: It's a stretch to blame the administration for the crisis, but government policy has for years encouraged homeownership through tax breaks and other incentives. Also, banks are required to offer loans to lower-quality borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act. Under President Bush, the White House has become a vocal proponent of consumer spending to keep the economy afloat (as in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks). Such policies can be viewed as antagonistic to saving. That's notable because many subprime borrowers made little or no down payments, in part because they had little cash to put down.

A: Using the parking brake regularly is a good practice because it takes stress off the parking pawl, which mechanically locks the transmission to keep the wheels from turning. Car makers often recommend shifting the transmission into "park" only after setting the parking brake. This puts pressure on the brakes instead of the drive components and reduces wear on the parking pawl. Remember parking on even the slightest incline can put significant pressure on the pawl.

Rates of MS have increased over the last several decades. This increase could reflect the fact that women are having fewer children, said the lead author of the study, Anne-Louise Ponsonby of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia. It's not clear what it is about pregnancy that protects against MS or causes its temporary remission. It's likely that hormones play a role, and studies are underway looking at estrogen as a treatment for the illness. It's also possible that immune changes that take place during pregnancy alter symptoms of the disease as well as the risk of developing it.
øCertainly I have seen this in my own career, and I bet you have too. When I was a young lawyer, I took any and every case. Then I specialized in business and bankruptcy law, and never looked back. It was more fun and more lucrative.

Believe you me, being called "America's small business expert" sure beats being the King of the Idiots Guides.
