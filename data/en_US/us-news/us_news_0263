He filled folders with stories sent to magazines like the New Yorker, with notes back and forth from his editors.

The place definitely stands out on a block anchored by a bikini store. One night a doggy stroller (pink, and my first sighting) is parked just outside the front doors. By the time I leave sometime after 10 p.m., the stroller and its occupant are gone, replaced by that trendy bit of paraphernalia, the velvet rope. What? The gentleman hired to man the door tells us the downstairs level becomes a club in the later hours. On this wind-swept night with not one person in line, this seems more like wishful thinking.

How disillusioned this group, who flocked to the voting booths en masse for Obama in 2008, must be. Most had no idea Obama's "hope and change" would mean they'd not have the resources to pay for the federal deficit he's piled on their backs, as well as the student loan debt they're drowning in. They never dreamed "change" meant the end of their freedom of choice because Obamacare mandates that all must purchase health insurance, period. Most did not anticipate a lack of ample-paying jobs would force them to live in their parents' basements post-graduation.

Less than a month after the attacks, about 30 Greater Cleveland artists and writers gathered one evening for a where-do-we-go-from-here forum. Many arts shows were canceled in the wake of 9/11, and there was a pervading sense that simply forging ahead seemed trivial.
Republican efforts to reduce government and reform the way we conduct business in the Garden State began with the passage of last year’s historic cap on property tax rates, followed by arbitration and public employee pension and health benefits reform.

Impunity is a poison to government – as deadly as hemlock. The anger is just a preliminary paralyzing symptom. Allowing two sets of rules, one for the police and another for everyone else, is irresponsible and shows a reckless disregard for the social infrastructure of our community.

Even though it looks like the joint is on fire from the volume of smoke belching out a vent, just wave the smoke out of your eyes and walk on in to El Pollo Rey in Armourdale for the best grilled chicken in town. El pollo rey is Spanish for �chicken king,� and your choices in this tiny corner restaurant are chicken (whole), chicken (half) and chicken (wings). When it comes to chicken grilled over a real wood fire, this place has it going on. Spatchcocked (splayed) chickens are first placed around the edges of the grate above the roaring log fire behind the front counter. After the meat is cooked through, the birds are moved into the center to brown the skins. The meat is moist, and delicious and imbued with a smoky flavor. Average-tasting Spanish rice, pinto beans and warm corn tortillas come free on the side, as do pickled red onion slices. Refrigerated bottles of Coke and Jarritos (a Mexican soft drink brand) are the beverage selections. There are a few tables, but most customers get their chicken to go. If you dine in, you�ll be eating out of a Styrofoam box. Cash only � $12 for a whole chicken, $6.50 for half and $6 for 10 wings.

Those of us who have lived in San Diego since the 1960s have seen our fair city by the sea destroyed by greedy developers telling us we need to be a "world-class city" while our roads fall into disrepair and sewage runs into the sea. Why not drive up to L.A. if you want a world-class city and make the developers pay for decent roads and sewage treatment before they are allowed to spend another dime on huge moneymaking projects that further tax our infrastructure? – Edward Kinsey, La Jolla

I encountered the same sort of inconsistencies with the pizzas. The first night, the spinach pizza's crust was heavy, almost leaden and unappealing. But on another visit the vongole, an intriguing red sauce pizza topped with clams still in their shell, was served on a notably lighter Neapolitan-style crust baked in a double-decker gas pizza oven. Too bad the clams were gritty.

A recent Post-Dispatch story that detailed how other cities are outpacing St. Louis in the growth of businesses owned by women struck a chord, for obvious reasons, with Barbaglia.

And she can also make an argument that, to a lesser degree, a male-dominated business community is slow to lose its grip.

Bud: A note fell out of my morning PD, "You will profit from a spin." Is it referring to a casino visit or an insightful column? -- James D, Richmond Heights
Palms Place penthouses are privately owned and rented out, so despite being high-end, they are more than a place to throw your clothes on the bed in between casino runs.
If there was one to recommend over the others, it would probably be Chippendales, in part because some of their dancers also sing -- and they're pretty good too. But the Chippendales men are also the Playboy Bunnies of the male stripper world for a reason, and that is that they tend to hire very sexy, handsome men with fine but not grotesquely muscled bodies who also have an intangible approachability to them.

In the six-page analysis, Stearns goes on to make several claims about the proposed plan, including the assertion that the original $1.64 return on every dollar spent is inaccurate. Stearns’s report claims that if the river channel is not deepened from the current 40 feet to 45 feet, companies would shift to using smaller “feeder” vessels to ship goods to area markets, rather than rely on more expensive trucking, as contended by the Corps. Taking that into account would “reduce the Corps’ own estimated benefit-cost ratio from $1.64 to $1.10.”

Crisscrossing the still healthy flow of the South Fork of Deer Creek, the trail entered the cover of a canyon, ducking into a forest of oak, juniper and sycamores that were just starting to allow the touch of spring on the forest floor.

As the trail climbed 2,600 feet, cascades were captured in deep pools. Closer to its 6,000-feet destination, Forest Road 201, ponderosa pines appeared, making the South Fork Trail a cool retreat from the sun.

It's not like he's a rookie."
A law guardian is appointed to every child under the supervision of the Division of Youth and Family Services, the state’s child welfare system, to speak on the child’s behalf.

There’s definitely a little bit of rust because there was such a long layoff, but each day I’m getting a bit of that polished out and I’m starting to feel like my old self again. I’m starting to feel like a football player and somebody who’s going to be able to make an impact as we come to the playoff chase. There’s nothing that’s going to be handed to me.
