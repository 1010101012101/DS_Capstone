"A six-month extension of the debt ceiling might not be enough to avoid a credit downgrade and the higher interest rates that all Americans would have to pay as a result," Obama said.

But the action is in the casinos, where gamblers sit transfixed in front of rows of slot machines or pray for a windfall at the blackjack tables.

A: The Tax Policy Center projects that there will be 438,000 households earning $1 million or more annually in 2015, the year they examined to give presidential candidates' tax plans time to be enacted and take effect.

That is just over one-tenth of one percent of all 169 million taxpayers.

Beltran had an RBI single in the second before launching another three-run homer in the third that made it 12-1, a drive to left center for Beltran's team-leading seventh homer after a replay overturned the initial umpire ruling and justified fireworks and a sign in the shape of a truck grill that blinked its headlights even though Beltran initially had to put the brakes on at second base.

It's unrealistic to expect that the filing of charges will silence all those in the blogosphere and elsewhere who claim certitude about exactly what happened the night of Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. Some of them are influenced by racial bigotry or political agendas, and they may be immune to pleas for patience or appeals to the reality that the improbable sometimes is true. The prospect of a trial most likely won't restrain those who have littered the Internet with supposed evidence of Martin's bad character (such as irrelevant infractions at school) or satisfy those who tell anyone who will listen that it's obvious Zimmerman wouldn't have found a white youth in a hoodie suspicious. But as the judicial process gets underway, perhaps those closest to the case may feel it less necessary to offer dueling and speculative accounts of what happened in the still-obscure moments when two men clashed and one took the life of another.

Few albums of the New Wave era have held up as well as the B-52s' ridiculous debut. From "Planet Claire" to "Dance This Mess Around," it sounds as though its songs are being beamed in from another planet. And it spawned one of the more unlikely mainstream breakthroughs of the decade -- "Rock Lobster." These guys really hit the mainstream where it lived a decade later, going Top 5 with "Love Shack" and "Roam." But their earliest records are the ones that, in a perfect world, would guarantee these party-rock iconoclasts their overdue induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Sunday's Kansas City Star article indicates that some individuals have called into question their own prior statements regarding an arson case that my office tried in the 1990s. This case was handled by experienced and highly professional agents and prosecutors. We have every confidence in their work, which was reviewed on appeal and in subsequent collateral litigation. But our paramount goal is to ensure that justice is served in every case. We should ensure that all evidence is carefully considered. In order to ensure that these new assertions are reviewed and considered in a thorough and unbiased manner, on Monday morning I requested that the Department of Justice designate an attorney outside the U.S. Attorney's Office to review the assertions. We will fully cooperate with this review in order to assure that justice is served.

"I experienced losses in my life over the past few months. It made me truly realize the healing power of music. I don't think it's an accident that I have had my current single, 'Over You,' to fall back on during these difficult times. My fans have been the biggest help over the past few months, because they made me realize that everyone has a great extended support system that they don't always acknowledge. I'm lucky that mine just happens to be arenas full of awesome people."

Like many other Tea Party supporters, Adams said the biggest goals are to balance the budget and reduce the national debt. And on those, it was unclear where he was willing to compromise. He expects lawmakers like Paul who campaigned on a promise to balance the federal budget within a year and pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to put forward proposals to do so. It would not be enough, Adams said, to reach an agreement to, say, balance the budget over five years.

Any time our spirits lowered, we would provide each other with the support needed to regroup and remember who we were playing for.

But the baroque oratorio stands out from nearly everything else that regularly appears in the concert hall.

The fact that Len Stone was supported by the Pacifica Police in the last election is entirely beside the point. He was elected to represent the whole community, all of us, and that appears to be exactly what he is doing, and in very difficult circumstances. Sounds like almost the opposite of "shameful" to me. He may have lost Mr. Mercurio's vote, but his thoughtful, business-like, even-handed approach has won him many others.

Sacramento Kings 95, Blazers 92 -- Feb. 2:
Critics say that Metro has, in particular, prioritized rail service over bus service, which in turn adversely affects low-income and minority communities that rely heavily on buses, often for long commutes from home to work or school and back. But both Metro and federal officials say that minority populations make up the majority of bus riders (90%) and rail passengers (83%).

Unique in the memory of the small slice of Oregonians who have ever attended a board of higher education meeting, the room was jammed with people who could not not be there. The crowd included faculty, bearing Lariviere's endorsement by every UO school and department head; students, venturing off campus during dead week; parents; contributors; politicians; people who have their names on UO buildings; standees four-deep, wearing fedoras, furious expressions and T-shirts reading "WE LOVE OUR PREZ," possibly a first in the history of higher education. It was as if all of Lane County, and anyone who had ever spent four years in Lane County, was in revolt.

In a seafood bisque, the scallops, shrimp and crab are all particularly well prepared and fresh-tasting, but the soup itself is bland, without any strong seafood flavor. That's too bad, because this very traditional preparation, which relies less on cream than on a reduction of shellfish, depends on it. The cassoulet at Gitan — listed on the menu simply as "cassoulet" — may also be a traditional preparation. If so, I prefer a cassoulet brimming with tender pork and duck, which tastes like it's been cooking all day. Here, it comes off as a bean stew with some occasional meat.
Mabley told the jury to disregard anything Senser may have said to them.
ESPN is a credible news organization that usually does not get stories wrong. So my inclination is to want to believe their report. But the Saints are denying this story vociferously. If there is guilt, the Saints would likely have said nothing, or as little as possible.
In light of all this, it stands to reason that the wage gap will narrow, even if it doesn't disappear. A study by a research organization called Reach Advisors shows that single women in their 20s make 105 percent of single men in their 20s in urban areas, and 120 percent "in certain cities with a heavily knowledge-driven employment base." These women must not realize that they will never make their way in the workplace without Congress somehow acting to ensure "equal pay."

We are in a public safety crisis. The embattled public safety director has resigned, an interim chief is at the helm of the state's largest police department, public confidence is shaken by a series of challenging events, and confusion reigns as the people who comprise public safety, the administration, the City-County Council and the community try to make sense of it all. As a longtime participant in the strategic elements of the Department of Public Safety, I am concerned that the office bears little resemblance to what has made Indianapolis a safe place to live and work. Before the mayor, council and community come together again to consider who should be the director of public safety, it seems appropriate, if not prudent, to examine the position, the scope of the office and the job description.

It's this produce that makes The Ranch dishes so interesting.
A: He can't be; he's not a point guard. Even when he took Cole's minutes in Wednesday's victory over the Thunder, he entered at his normal shooting guard, with LeBron James or Dwyane Wade handling. Has Harris played better than Cole recently? It would be hard to play much worse. The Cole issue is not a Harris issue; it is whether Norris has become a liability.

They're winning because CF Jon Jay is batting .344 with a couple of homers, and catching everything that he can possibly get to. They're winning because Mitchell Boggs, Jason Motte, Marc Rzepczynski and bullpen mates are, for the most part, getting the big outs. They're winning because young backup outfielders Shane Robinson and Eric Komatsu have gone a combined 8 for 22 when asked to contribute.

A The rule of thumb is to use the lowest-octane gasoline that will operate the engine efficiently. For the vast majority of modern cars and trucks, that means regular unleaded, which is typically 87 octane. The octane rating of gasoline is a measure of the fuel's resistance to ignition, meaning the higher the octane rating, more heat and pressure are required to "start the fire." If the recommended octane gasoline provides proper starting, power, drivability and efficiency, there's no benefit to using higher-octane fuel.

Giulietta’s Venetian lair saw the return of the burlesquers in a kind of commedia dell’arte-style bordello, complete with a mask or two. Mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova captured the courtesan’s opportunistic spirit. But the famous barcarolle “Belle nuit, o nuit d’amour” didn’t quite have the opulent sound it could have. Singing with Gubanova, mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey, as Hoffmann’s muse and friend Nicklausse, seemed too light-voiced. Still, in her crucial role, she was never less than dramatically engaging.

In Kano, the state capital, there's a sense of crisis about the number of divorcees, although statistics aren't available to back up widespread perceptions of an increase in failed marriages.

“It doesn’t surprise me how Doc is using him with the players he’s with. He’s very efficient, and other centers don’t want to go out and guard him.

Second, we’ve done some research to respond productively to your item 1). ORS 382.310(1)(a) states that the County is responsible to “maintain, keep in good condition and repair and operate” the Willamette River bridges located within the City of Portland. As we have discussed already, that applies whether or not the City or County owns the bridge itself. Therefore, the first step in any transfer is a change to ORS that reverts control of the bridges to the City. On our end, we would also need to figure out how to maintain and operate the bridges we have outside the City, i.e. the Sauvie Island Bridge, bridges in East Multnomah County. In short, because of the work that needs to be done to ensure a smooth transfer and keep the Sellwood bridge process online, transferring the bridges prior to this agreement is out of the question. If “during” means at some point over the term of this IGA, that seems more reasonable and I suspect we’d be able to get language we can all agree on.

Just before Los Angeles County runs out and Orange County begins, a southbound traveler comes across the watery neighborhood known as Naples. It's a cluster of three upscale residential islands, with waterways in between. And those waterways are a fine place to float, perhaps in a kayak from Kayaks on the Water (5411 E. Ocean Blvd) or maybe by Venetian gondola. For $85 a couple, Gondola Getaway offers 50-minute floating adventures just about every day, complete with gondolieri in striped shirts and straw hats. Bring a refreshment (no corkage fee). Or a crowd -- the 10-vessel gondola fleet offers various options for larger groups (including a "pizza cruise" for 6-10 people at $35 per person). Some of the guys sing – a nice effect under the echoing bridges -- and many play mood music. Especially around sunset, it's a memorable float, to drift past snazzy homes under the darkening sky. Ignacio Villanueva, a veteran gondolier, says he's seen many a marriage proposal, and only one turn-down. Excellent odds, gentlemen. And if you proposal doesn't pan out – well, you can jump ship and swim for Tantalum restaurant (6272 E.

Main support act Trey Songz barely dances, he isn’t particularly ambitious, and his material is nowhere near as good as Usher’s. It didn’t matter. He’s become the better performer. Songz is the rare singer who can make an arena feel intimate — and not just because he flirts, successfully, with individual girls in the crowd.

While Usher’s choruses were sometimes pumped in during acrobatic dance routines, Trey Songz simply faced us and sang.

But American industries produced more goods than Americans could buy, and a regular cycle of overproduction followed by financial panics roiled the economy throughout the late 19th century.

The problem, of course, is that traditions are always evolving. Tevye soon discovers this as his daughters begin to fall in love, and as a government-lead pogrom pushes Jewish residents out of their village. Everything is changing, nothing is the same. In the face of change, even the local rabbi, the community's symbolic tradition-bearer, is dumbfounded. No one is quite sure how to navigate the winds of change.
