It will be tough for SLU to win the league. Temple's got a half-game lead, but really it's a two-game lead because they have the tiebreaker edge. If SLU goes 5-0, Temple has to go 3-2 for SLU to win the league. If SLU goes 4-1, Temple has to go 2-3. The odds are strongly in Temple's favor. (If SLU had beaten Temple, it would have a commanding lead in the league.)

To help reduce the number of uninsured Americans, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to include legal residents with incomes up to 33% above the federal poverty line. Although Washington will pick up at least 90% of the cost of the new enrollees, the expansion will still cost states tens of millions of dollars annually. The states' lawsuit against the act contends that they are being coerced to do something that Congress doesn't have the power to order them to do. Yet the law didn't create any new hurdles to states dropping out of the program and providing for the poor and disabled on their own. The fact that they don't want to is testament to how good a deal Medicaid remains for states, even with the expanded eligibility.

The idea for dipping warm muffin crowns in a little melted butter then in cinnamon-spiked sugar, comes from cooking expert Marion Cunningham in her 1987 "Breakfast Book" (Knopf, out of print). The process creates a beautiful cap on the muffins and I like the way the cinnamon tastes (I often double the amount of cinnamon from 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon). Some bakers like to transfer batter to muffin tin using a large spoon sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. That system works fine. I like to use my mother's old orange-handled ice cream scoop that measures out a little less than one-quarter cup of batter.

That Harry lived as long as he did is a miracle. In fact, it is surprising he even made it to adulthood. As he related in his darkly beautiful memoir "A Childhood: The Biography of a Place," Harry grew up during the Depression in the most desperate and benighted circumstances. A son of Bacon County, Ga., hard by the Okefenokee Swamp, he was raised on a diet of biscuits made from lard and flour, and he ate clay to compensate for various mineral deficiencies. His father died when Harry was 2. At 5 he contracted polio. When he was 7, he fell into a vat of boiling water during a hog slaughtering and watched in horror as pieces of his skin sloughed onto the ground in wet, pink folds. From his earliest years he felt damaged and outcast.

"These schools require truly comprehensive services, from instructional to operational support," said Jennifer Shea, a senior program manager at the School Turnaround Group, part of the Boston-based Mass Insight Education, which is working with six states on turnarounds. "Very few organizations currently have the capacity do this work. ... I don't think these types of providers necessarily have the wrong intentions, but we need stricter standards for how partners are being selected and monitored."

“We didn’t always get the same kids that other schools got, but we used volleyball as a vehicle to get students to graduate,” Wong said. “It was very family oriented. Some kids lacked that strong adult role model. We always made them go to class and behave. If you didn’t do that, you didn’t play. That was it.”

Go to a college game now and you'll see a lot of NHL scouts and coaches. Scouts from the Minnesota Wild, Florida Panthers and Pittsburgh Penguins made their way to a lot of DU games this season. Jason Zucker, Drew Shore and Beau Bennett (before he got hurt) were scouted almost every game by the teams who hold their respective NHL rights. At a recent DU-Wisconsin game, Anaheim Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau was in attendance at Magness Arena to see Badgers defenseman Justin Schultz, a second-round pick for Anaheim in 2010. Back in the day, you almost never saw an NHL scout at a college game.

While the mayor's plan would greatly speed up rail construction, it would come at a price. Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Marc Littman acknowledged that borrowing costs would be "a lot more" because of the increased interest payments. Although the exact amount of the increased financing cost is not known, Metro is currently short $4 billion that would be needed to meet the accelerated construction schedule, officials said. But Littman said building faster could save money in the long run by allowing Metro to take advantage of cheaper construction costs and low inflation and interest rates.
Exhibit A: House Armed Service Chairman Buck McKeon expressed happiness to see Obama talking to the troops. Yet he couldn’t help throwing in the observation that this visit came “after nearly a year of not speaking about the war and 17 months of not visiting the war zone.”

“But I don’t think of it as a romantic book,” Gilbert continues. “I didn’t want the conversation about marriage to be clouded by the froth of romance. I feel it’s too important and serious for that. I’d say ‘Eat, Pray, Love’is an enormously romantic book, even before the love story begins . . . The difference in tone between ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ and ‘Committed’ is the difference in tone between romance and marriage. Both about love, but in different ways.”

Person said he doesn't want his officers taking on too many new roles.
For many Obama boosters in the blue states, it’s yet another example of the lack of respect toward the nation’s first black president, and the inability of the right to disagree without being disagreeable. Obama perhaps never more strongly evokes baseball legend Jackie Robinson, stoically enduring abuse from white teammates who resent his inclusion in the club.

Bigger bills will fall due elsewhere. Earlier this year, the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation examined unfunded retiree health-care liabilities in 10 midsize municipalities, including Worcester and Springfield, and found the debt averaged $13,685 per household. To pay those commitments over 30 years would require adding $565 a year to property tax bills on average, the group estimated. In one community, Lawrence, the tab was $1,209 annually, a 50% increase over current taxes.
Adopted from state foster care, the boy appears to have been abused in his new home. He talks of being tossed in a creek, fed baby formula and forced to sleep outside. If he was good, he got a blanket.

Any similarity is so minimal that it doesn't constitute copyright infringement, Van Nest argued. "Google played it by the book."
Employees in certain districts or towns can — sometimes with encouragement from employers — work rather than take vacation or sick days. While towns can save money on overtime in the current budget year, future payments in some instances are made at workers’ higher final salary rates. The bill (S2220) would cap the end-of-career payment at $15,000 for employees who haven’t reached that magic number, and freeze payments for workers already over that limit.
"We're really going after the lunch, happy hour and dinner crowds this time around," Wagner said. ""We'll still get the college kids. They don't come out until 11 o'clock, so there's no overlap."

“There’s an opportunity for diversion,” he explained. “They’ll be evaluated by mental health professionals. Obviously, the schools have a heightened sensitivity and likewise, we have taken this low-tolerance approach. It’s our hope, as this evolves through the justice system, that some of these kids needing the help are getting the help they need. The schools have been fantastic to work with.”

An estimated 34 million Americans work as unpaid caregivers to other adults, spending an average of 21 hours a week, according to the most recent AARP study. It describes the typical unpaid caregiver as a 46-year-old woman who works outside the home while caring for an elderly relative. In families with siblings, one child typically assumes the brunt of the responsibilities of primary caregiver. Sibling resentments and rivalries can easily fester and combust.

Obama: Supports legal recognition of same-sex marriage, a matter decided by states. Opposed that recognition in 2008 presidential campaign, and in 2004 Senate campaign, while supporting the extension of legal rights and benefits to same-sex couples in civil unions.

Has not achieved repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and affirms the right of states to refuse to recognize such marriages. Administration has ceased defending the law in court but it remains on the books.

Why air-sickness bags? It's apparently because the airline has already sold ad space on every other conceivable surface. For $119,000 you can advertise on tray tables for three months, according to the report. For $196,000 you can paint your corporate message on the outsides of overhead bins, and for $14 million you can plaster your company's logo on the exterior of every Spirit Airlines jet for a year.

Having been through so many Opening Days, what kind of attention does he pay to what kind of ovation he gets?
Voters, like everyone else, will eventually have to get used to the new, slower mail service, and that will mean making earlier requests for vote-by-mail ballots, voting earlier and dropping the ballots in the mailbox earlier. But shutting down mail distribution just weeks before the presidential primary would be foolish, given that many people won't yet have gotten the word about the longer time needed for ballot turnaround.

It's going to be tough for those involved Wednesday. First you are dealing with the horror of losing a loved one. Their phones were ringing off the hook Wednesday with family and friends asking if they had seen the news, did they know if their loved one was safe or not, and then for some, and endless condolences that will go on until the answering machine is filled.
Oh, the subplots continue, dripping with drama. Of course, Stan would much rather have the all-star center at his disposal. He's not crazy. Whether their differences are petty or irreconcilable, nothing is as uncomfortable for the club's two lightning rods as losing.

Compensation for spouses of presidents is not new. In fact, the University of Iowa is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), a group of 63 large research universities that estimates as many as half of its members now pay the spouses of presidents. In fact, the AAU adopted guidelines in 2001 urging governing boards to recognize a partners role when they recruited presidents, and to consider offering spouses a titled position with a job description, salary and/or benefits. The AAU recommendations were made because they recognize that being a spouse is effectively a full-time job, and one that requires their attention,commitment, and presence  24-hours a day, 7 days a week.

The time came to file my review, so that's where I left it. Expedition Two into the metro Boston area was far more successful. I didn't do anything differently but somehow, the blind could now see. I routinely hit LTE speeds of 35 to 40 megabits per second. That's twice as fast as the WiFi in my house!

"Soccer, hockey, lacrosse tournaments inside and outside the stadium could really help with the sales pitch on making this 'The People's Stadium' as the governor would like," Griffith wrote to the mayor, Gov.

Of course, the place to do that, as well as stimulate the harmony within, is in the quiet of nature. Though this place isn't quite in the middle of nowhere -- single-family homes surround the property, and there's a Wendy's two miles away -- amid the thick trees and classic Buddhist architecture, things still feel a world away from the chain hotels of downtown Bloomington.

The folks at HTC are probably still celebrating so let's just be quiet here while we talk about how silly those numbers are. The beauty of the Windows Phone OS is that it's a clean, uncluttered, and elegant design. Unlike an Android phone, a Windows Phone doesn't need a lot of real estate. So if anything, a large screen is a disadvantage; it makes it hard for people with smaller hands (like, I dunno . . . women) to operate the Titan. It's a shame, because I reckon I can do more with just one outstretched thumb on a Windows Phone than I can with two hands holding Android.

Asked later if he feels now like he should have spoke up, Toomer replied, "No, because no matter what, they have an agenda. They're going to go through what they're going to do. I could talk until I'm blue in the face. It's not going to make any difference. I know after dealing with the head coach, that's kind of how he is. You can talk to him and do all of that, but if he has something in his mind, that's what's going to go on."

Investigators and prosecutors have not named Terri Horman or Spicher as suspects in the case and are going to great lengths to avoid mentioning their names in public. But their actions show investigators remain intently focused on their every move the day Kyron disappeared. Last weekend, they distributed a flier with photos of both women to residents along Northwest Old Germantown Road, seeking any tips on whether the two women, or the Horman truck, were seen in the area between 9:45 a.m. and 1 p.m. on June 4.
President Barack Obama scored at least one clear victory in the debt-ceiling battle, putting defense cuts on the line in the next round of budget talks. That prospect gives Democrats their biggest, and perhaps only, point of leverage as the parties prepare for negotiations this fall.
I like to take a spoonful and mix it with plain Greek yogurt to create a quick dip for veggies or a cold sauce for grilled fish. And I will admit that I used it recently to doctor up a can of vegetable beef soup when unexpected guests turned up for lunch and my larder was empty. The company had no idea they were eating soup from a can and asked for the recipe. Hail to the secret zhug soup.
"While the trajectory isn't awe-inspiring, the direction is becoming clearer," he said.
"Five or seven years ago, the private sector started rewarding providers that got their patients' chronic conditions like diabetesÃÂ and asthma under control," Davis said.

We already have quite a bit of data about what happens when intensive interventions attempt to improve activity levels and nutrition for the purposes of producing weight loss. Activity levels and nutrition improve; meanwhile, weight is not lost. This is because we don't know how to make people thinner. If you're going to indulge in the fiction that saying we should do something somehow makes it possible to do it, I'm going to indulge in the fiction that pointing out a fact over and over again to people who don't want to acknowledge it will somehow cause them to eventually acknowledge it.

If approved by the full Legislature, voters would have the ultimate say in the consolidation, because both departments are in the state constitution. The vote would be in November, and the changes would take place in 2011.
Scott had another weird result in the sixth inning, one that may show up on highlight (or lowlight, depending on your point of view) reels for a while. He hit a drive to center that sent Saunders back to the wall. He made a leaping attempt, only to have the ball glance off his glove and over the fence. That gave the Rays the lead to stay.

Springfield hitting: Newcomer Jake Shaffer started in left field and went 1-for-4 with a run scored. ... First baseman Xavier Scruggs, a righthanded masher, was 2-for-3 with a run scored. Scruggs has had one of the better power springs of any prospect. He's shown an ability to pull with authority while not giving up that gap power the other way. Matt Adams leapfrogged Scruggs on the depth chart last season and took the first base job in Class AA Springfield. Now it's Scruggs turn to hit the Texas League, and if his performance this spring carries over he'll enjoy the hitter-friendly league. ... Third baseman Niko Vasquez was 1-for-3 with a 2-run single. ... Second baseman Kolten Wong continues to impress with a line-drive single during his 1-for-2 day. He also scored a run. Wong will be the starting second baseman for Class AA Springfield, and he's expected to start the game tomorrow against the major-league club. ... Greg Garcia went 1-for-3 with a double and RBI, and Rainel Rosario was 1-for-3 with a double and RBI. ... Nick Derba was 1-for-2, and Jose Garcia doubled in his only AB.

A middle-class retirement will look different in this decade and the decades to come, retirement experts believe. Even if the end of full-time work continues to fall, as it does for most, in our early 60s, retirement likely will include a job. Many homeowners will need to downsize. Others will have to take more responsibility for their finances, managing their spending, their investments, their IRA withdrawals and the like. Medical expenses will become even more important to prepare for.

The Gophers will have only 12 seniors on scholarship next season, so it's possible that they could have only 12 scholarships to hand out next February. It likely will be more than that -- "There's always some natural attrition every year," Kill said, "so we may still end up with 16 or 17" -- but there is little chance that Kill and his staff will sign 27 scholarship athletes, as they did in February, or even the 23 they brought in a year before.

"I can remember the first number they ever called — 810," said Robert Strigler, a 74-year-old retiree who buys tickets at the Welsh Farms store every day. "I’ve won $9,000. Another time $6,000.

"The Big Year," based on the book by Mark Obmascik, is a charming, cute little comedy, and the rarest of projects: a PG-rated film that isn't necessarily aimed at families and kids. It's really an everyone movie. And although the characters are razor-thin and the dialogue is as wooden as the branches, there are some nice, light moments with our three primary birders: Stu, the rich executive played by Steve Martin; Kenny, the champion bird-spotter played by Owen Wilson; and Brad, the computer programmer played by Jack Black, who is in sweet-and-earnest mode.

Rosalin Eve has been part of our family for just over a year, shortly after I asked the famous question "What do you call a grandpa-to-be?" (By the way, I decided to go with "Grandpa Geer" after all.) In that time, I've watched Rosie triple her birth weight, stand nearly 2-and-a-half feet tall, and take her first wobbling steps around her parents' coffee table. She now even stands up unassisted.

Just as crucially, tight credit threatens to shut the safety valve of the low-wage sector of the economy. Many Americans have been borrowing, quite simply, to live. Try paying for an apartment, food, clothes and medicines on the $20,000 annual salary of a low-wage worker. We have an anodyne myth that everybody who works full time in this country can somehow make do. The "secret" to their making do is often a Visa card with a balance that is never paid off. For low-wage workers, credit has been a lifesaving crutch.

Every quarterback waits at Ohio State, at least everyone since Art Schlichter started as a true freshman in 1978. That was so long ago that Woody Hayes was on the sideline, probably cussing the mere thought of a forward pass after each of Schlichter's five interceptions against Penn State.
Terry was killed in a shootout with border bandits in December 2010. A gun used in his shooting was connected to the botched federal operation known as Fast and Furious, in which agents lost track of nearly 1,400 of the more than 2,000 guns purchased by suspected straw buyers.
What happens after a dog joins a household, and the human-animal bond blossoms into a relationship that outlasts some marriages?
State media have in recent weeks drawn colorful parallels between Web rumors and drugs. In multiple commentary pieces on the websites of state-run Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily newspaper, Internet rumors were called "psychological drugs" and likened to pornography, gambling, and a "malignant tumor," and labeled as worse than heroin and cocaine, poisoning society.
Tellingly, China, Germany and a half-dozen other countries betting heavily on alternative energy looking are not batting an eye at either the Solyndra meltdown or the Volt battery problems. By conservative estimates, China is outspending the U.S. three-to-one on renewable energy initiatives, and Russia, Brazil and India are following Beijing's lead. Solyndra's failure, by all accounts, had less to do with solar energy's limited horizons than with the relative strength of Solyndra's (subsidized) competitors around the globe.

Colleges get away with that because they're not really focused on "offering a challenging voyage of intellectual discovery" or similar verbiage found in their marketing material. Instead, they function as America's gatekeepers: If you want to get anywhere in this country, generally you've got to get through college.

Or how about paint colors? Paint colors are hilarious. I'm planning to repaint our bathroom in a very subtle light brown, and I found these color names on the Sherwin-Williams color-palette website: Accessible Beige. Frolic. Cardboard. Serious Gray. Harmonic tan. Drizzle. Inland. Zeus. My favorite was Distance, which is a very pretty deep blue that clearly needs its space. Maybe it makes your walls appear far away and aloof.
The resort is once again firmly gripped in offseason — that lull between the closing of the ski areas and the rush of summer.

A. In a way, your comment hits to the heart of many medical conditions. For example, hypertension is considered a silent disease, which if not addressed leads to severe problems. This is because the underlying disease process continues until the damage becomes noticeable. Multiple sclerosis is a complex disorder of the central nervous system, the brain and the spinal cord, that is understood to have an immunological basis. For about 85 percent of affected individuals, it presents in a relapsing remitting course. Early in the disease inflammatory processes are prominent. As the disease continues over decades, a more degenerative process occurs within the CNS. The symptoms may be mild, such as tingling that is sometimes erroneously attributed to a pinched nerve or carpal tunnel syndrome, and then resolve or remit. Often symptoms are ignored when they are attributed to a coincidental event. I think people in general, are optimistic, and seek medical help only when problems start to interfere with their daily activities.

From Manila to San Francisco, the Philippines to Seattle; this unlikely band of bighearted eccentrics is born with suitcases packed and ready for takeoff. Where they land isn't always important.

Here, they make their best attempts to navigate the complexities of two disparate cultures, straddling a vast geographical and cultural divide.
Superintendent Kevin Maxwell recommended the board vote against entering into a memorandum of understanding that would have allowed the city to move forward with the project, which calls for using a portion of the parking lot at Annapolis Elementary for a garage.

While some utilities are still pursuing full-scale plants, there is a parallel push for smaller reactors that could be easier for utilities to finance and minimize sticker shock for regulators and consumers. But despite a lower total cost, there's no evidence yet that tiny fission factories would be able to produce electricity at a competitive cost in an era of abundant, cheap natural gas.
That limitation can make office work -- like writing a document, say -- more difficult that it can be on a PC.
