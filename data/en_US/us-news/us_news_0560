Men and women, even children, take hold of the unloaded firearms.

The Answer: The best thing anybody could do when they're applying for a job is to be honest about their abilities. Most people build up resumes to make themselves look really good. The most important thing is to come across honestly, to discuss with the interviewer what you think you can do, what your talents are and strengths are. I find a lot of people talk about things that afterward they just can't do. It's a lot better to be honest.

Lu's organization has been deeply involved in earthquake relief, suggesting more sustainable rebuilding methods and winning the confidence of local residents. As a result, the locals have grown even more vigilant about poachers who illegally log or hunt in the preserve and surrounding areas.

In return, the services insisted that homosexuals serving in uniform stay closeted. No doubt this is what bothers Mullen, as it obliges homosexuals to "live a lie," if not actually tell one. But this part of the formula was not about individuals. It aimed to protect the institutional integrity of the services, which have no higher responsibility than to organize, train and equip formations that are effective on the battlefield. Seventeen years ago, the chiefs -- all four of us, plus the chairman and vice chairman -- concluded that allowing open homosexuality in the ranks probably would damage the cohesiveness of our combat units.

"Cars lined up for blocks to get their maximum 2-gallon allotment at the Tustin Garage in the 1920s. Across the country, refined gas production could not keep up with the growing number of cars on the road as ranch horses were increasingly replaced with gas-powered tractors and trucks. Oddly, the 30-cent-per-gallon price of gas during those days equates to about $3 a gallon today." Photo courtesy of the Tustin Area Historical Society.

Fast and Furious, which began in Phoenix in November 2009, was an effort by ATF officials to implement a Justice Department strategy that focused on identifying and investigating Mexican drug cartel networks, rather than just arresting individual illegal gun buyers, ATF officials testified Tuesday.

If Oliver, an East Orange resident, were to go to the House, she would occupy what has been considered a Newark seat.

It's no surprise that the landscape is the star of many of these films. By 1910, the film industry had started its westward migration — major companies were setting up West Coast outposts, drawn by the congenial weather that permitted year-round shooting and the documentary value of location photography. D.W. Griffith's tale of filial vengeance "Over Silent Paths" (1910) emphasizes the vast desert landscape. The California redwoods tower over the heroine of "Salomy Jane." And "The Sergeant" (1910) — long thought lost but recently discovered in the New Zealand Film Archive — shows off the waterfalls and vistas of Yosemite National Park.

Berkman hit two Monday and would run his hit streak to four consecutive at-bats with a single in the third inning.

Frost was known as a curmudgeon, but he liked Stegner, and, according to Benson, it's likely that the younger writer's encounters with Frost suffused Vermont with a "special glow" in his mind. Stegner also took the title for his novel "Fire and Ice" (1941) from an eponymous Frost poem; his novel "Crossing to Safety" (1987) riffs on a line in the Frost poem "I Could Give All to Time": "But why declare / The things forbidden that while the Customs slept / I have crossed to Safety with?"

Pat Shurmur, on when physical attributes come into play: "We are always looking for bigger, stronger, faster guys. If you want me to compare guys who are short to guys that are taller, taller guys can sometimes see a little bit better, which will allow them to do some things. In terms of a physical nature, a quarterback does have to be able to take a little bit of a pounding. They all get hit.

Now, it's true. Green, who's from Saginaw, was not ready for the NBA after his freshman or even sophomore year. But that hasn't stopped other guys from jumping.

She is Scarlett O'Hara incarnate, complete with post-Fort Sumter backbone and ridiculous vanity.

A Social Intelligence report to a company would include racist remarks, sexually explicit photos or videos, or flagrant displays of weapons or illegal activity, Mr. Drucker says. And your decision to post a naked picture of yourself might not go over well with a potential employer. "That might not be relevant to the job, but an employer gets to determine if that's the kind of person he wants representing his company," Mr. Drucker says. "We don't make the decisions. We just generate the reports."

We are taught to believe the opposite, that "black" and "white" are self-evident and immutable. But I invite you to look up Walter White, the blond, blue-eyed "Negro" who once led the NAACP, or Gregory Howard Williams, the university president who didn't even know he was black until he was 10 years old. Dig up the old Jet magazine story about a woman who gave birth to twins -- one "black," one "white." And then think again. Race is a fraud, a cruel and stupid fraud.
When Williams pleaded guilty in New Jersey to aggravated assault for fatally shooting Costas "Gus" Christofi, 55, on Feb. 14, 2002, Deputy Attorney General Steven Farman asked the judge to revoke bail, calling Williams a danger to the public.

"This is really a new twist on an old scam," said Thomas Calcagni, director of the state Division of Consumer Affairs. "Boldly impersonating the state’s attorney general, co-opting the department’s seal and using a remarkably convincing story of an international securities settlement to direct people to call an in-state phone number. That’s a first for this division."
Like any good match, the relationship grew stronger as the years passed -- so strong, in fact, that a third company -- the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival -- joined the partnership in 2010. Now, a show such as "Romeo and Juliet" begins life in Cleveland, then is boxed up and taken on the road to Boise and, later, Lake Tahoe. The agreement allows Fee to keep his artistic and production staffs working full-time, avoiding the brutal turnover that plagues solitary, seasonal companies.
The state Gaming Enforcement Division fined the casino $17,500 in the underage gambling case and another $10,000 for violating the rules of Spanish 21, a variation of blackjack.
Nearly all the entrees at the Iron Gate follow the same formula: fish, poultry or meat in a sauce, served with rice or potatoes and a forgettable serving of steamed carrots, beans and broccoli rabe. Petrale sole amandine ($27), one night's special, brought a nicely prepared fillet; chicken Marsala ($22) sported a crisp skin, mushrooms and a rich sauce; and veal moutarde ($31), set aflame tableside, featured a fine balance of mustard, cream and wine.
Until the punishment is greater than the reward, players will continue to try to cheat the system. Maybe Bud Selig's three-strikes-and-you're-out stance is too permissive. Certainly, allowing a steroid user to keep or receive an MVP award is too lenient.

Forget Memorial Day. The summer music season in New Jersey doesn’t start until the first weekend of June, which is always crammed with big annual festivals. It’s upon us and, once again, the Garden State will be singing.

Other entries in the festival sweepstakes: Montclair’s Boro 6, now in its third year of supporting local music, and Plainfield’s Rhythm and Blues by the Brook, an annual showcase for rappers, singers and funkmasters.

As I learned serving on the 2008 Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment, the death penalty causes enormous hardship on the families of victims, who must wait years, even decades, for cases to conclude. Those are years of uncertainty and anguish as the crime is rehashed over and over again. I have deep sympathy for these families and believe they would be best served if judges imposed a maximum sentence of life without parole. I can tell you it is a severe punishment and one that does not drag on in court for decades.

But bed-sharing is dangerous. I've seen what SIDS or overlaying has done to the families of parents who have overlain their children — some families do well and some families fall apart. But I can tell you one thing, they never forget that baby. I know that there are bed-sharing advocates that say they've always done this and they've never lost a baby, but this is about probabilities.

"I mean, if he can do those things and anything else and it's a legal call, shoot, if I'm Blake I'd keep pushing guys from behind and doing what he's doing because he's playing his game, he's doing the right thing.

Decent performance from a small-displacement V-6 isn't a foregone conclusion, as the Lexus IS demonstrates: With a 204-horsepower, 2.5-liter V-6, the base Lexus IS 250 is a completely different car from the IS 350, which has a potent 306-hp, 3.5-liter V-6. The horsepower gulf between the 218-hp G25 and the 328-hp G37 appears similarly wide on paper, but the difference feels much smaller on the road.

øAn intuitive drawing studio for kids, "Draw and Tell HD" let's kids create artwork that they can talk about, and then it saves both the artwork and their narration to your photo album. And if they place stickers in their painting, kids can then move them around while narrating to create animation in the drawing; and all of the movement is captured as a short video with your child's voice narrating. For the youngest artist, the coloring pages offer one-touch filling of color. Each time your toddler touches an area on the page, the color changes. For older artists, the program offers blank pages with paint brushes, colored pencils, markers, stickers and patterns which are easy to access from the bottom and side of the screen. You can even layer stencils to create artwork that looks like it has been created by the Spirograph toy. This drawing app is a marvel in design from the ease of touching the screen to create art to the wonderful way it encourages kids to become animators of their own stories.

The video makes a fine coda to the show's 170 photographs, nearly all of them portraits of the artist in fictive roles defined by costume, makeup, pose, setting and sometimes the use of prostheses. "Doll Clothes" reasserts the themes that interested Sherman early on and continue to drive her work: transformation; the fluidity and multiplicity of identity; self-determination versus the external "hand" of social forces.

As I listened to the speakers at public forums over the last month yelling, protesting and berating public officials, I was reminded of the legend that while Rome burned, Emperor Nero refused to stop playing his fiddle and confront the emergency. I am reminded of another, verifiable story of the Titanics orchestra playing away on deck as the great ship sank beneath them. All eight of its members were lost.
Minnesota is one of five states that has treated such crimes as misdemeanors with little or no jail time and minimal fines. That left county prosecutors frustrated that the punishment did not match the level of maltreatment in severe cases of intentional harm. The new law would create a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
This northerly outpost for the successful operators of multiple restaurants in San Francisco is carefully adapted to appeal to the local crowd: cement floors, repurposed wood, a large bar area for the Pearl District's young smart set and a distinctively casual vibe throughout. The Southern-tinged menu is at its best with simple preparations, most notably Johnson County ham served with buttermilk biscuits and a sweet-piquant red pepper jelly on the appetizer menu and fried chicken with mashed potatoes, collard greens and country gravy among the mains. Though Southern more in name than anything else, the chocolate and coffee-focused frozen Mississippi Mud Pie sings a satisfying endnote to your meal.

No one's clamoring for the paw's return, because it's not really an Egyptian antiquity. It's from a film set erected for Cecil B. DeMille's early epic, "The Ten Commandments." The location -- Guadalupe Dunes of California's Central Coast -- remains nearly as isolated and pristine as when the legendary director scouted it in 1923. The dunes are a terrific place to enjoy both raw beauty and a slice of moviemaking history.

The kindest thing you can say about “Tenure,” in which Luke Wilson plays a sad-sack English teacher at a C-list college, is that it’s a sweet little film with some quiet laughs.
Currently, a salary scale for teachers is set in state law. The scale dictates the minimum amount teachers can be paid, $17,300, and lays out pay raises based on experience and level of college degree. Many school districts, however, have adopted their own salary scale, through collective bargaining, to replace the state's scale. SB 5 completely removes the scale from state law. In its place, the bill establishes performance-based criteria for teachers' raises. The bill does not establish a new minimum or maximum salary that teachers will be paid. That will be up to individual school districts. Once existing contracts expire, school districts would set their own pay scales, including a minimum salary, through negotiations with teachers' unions. If the two sides cannot agree on a pay scale, the school board would act as the final decision-maker. SB 5 establishes a new method of dispute resolution that requires an employer's legislative body -- commonly a school board or a city council -- to settle disputes.
Playing partner Brangan, who plays two to three times a week, echoed BiBasilio's remarks, saying, "This is a great golf course.

Underused airports from California to Ohio have seen their cargo efforts fizzle. Industry analysts point out that freight forwarders - the so-called travel agents of air cargo, who route freight across the globe for manufacturers - like to operate at big gateways like O'Hare, New York's JFK and Miami. Those places have many overseas flights - both passenger and cargo - and experienced networks of shipping companies. A fledgling operation, with just a few flights a week to one city, will find it hard to compete, said Michael Webber, a Kansas City-based cargo analyst. Freight forwarders send goods from factories to many destinations at once. They put it on a truck to the airport with the most options.

With this in mind, the modern-day researchers examined 2.7-billion-year-old sedimentary rock from South Africa. Tiny pits in the rock made by falling raindrops were quickly preserved by a thin layer of fine ash that acted rather like a protective varnish.

"It is difficult for us to imagine how going from 11 elected county officials down to 3 elected county officials with 13 more elected county council members and additional higher paid political appointments is considered reform," the letter says. "Once again we urge you to consider the voices calling for reform and their underlying agenda. We also ask you to consider what creating 13 elected districts will do for the cause of regionalism. This amendment certainly fails to address, and in many respects compounds the deficiencies of our community because of multi-jurisdictional political boundaries. This is not county reform."

Unfortunately, the fact that this country is in the midst of a presidential election campaign probably nullifies any prospect of any further material speedup by Obama in ending the American engagements. The most he can do now is to hope no more bad news turns up of the sort that the American press can't leave unreported, in its own obligations to the public.

Nice town; "ruff" politics. If constant bickering were an Olympic sport, Winter Park would be the perennial gold medalist. The latest news has the city fiercely fighting over where dogs should be allowed. There have been public meetings, e-mail campaigns, name-calling and even a three-page proposed ordinance that deals with "fecal matter." All of it comes to a head at a commission meeting later this month. You know, Winter Park really is an exquisite little town. Maybe some residents should take more time to enjoy it. Come to think of it, there may be some irony in complaints that dogs are the ones responsible for stinking up the place.

More lanes (kind of) to help with Honolulu highway congestion: With traffic on H-1 leading into downtown Honolulu becoming a snarl, the state is considering adding an extra lane in each direction. No construction will be done – instead the medians will disappear and lanes will shrink to 10 feet from 11.5 feet. As the Honolulu Star Advertiser pointed out, the popular Ford F-150 truck is 8.5 feet wide, not counting the side mirrors. The freeway already features a "zipper lane" during peak periods when one lane on the opposite side of the freeway is given to counter-flow traffic during rush hours, reducing the less-busy side to two lanes.
