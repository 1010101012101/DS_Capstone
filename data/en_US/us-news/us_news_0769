What was your reaction to Maryland basketball guard Terrell Stoglin leaving the team after a one-year suspension, and where does this leave the program?
WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy U.S. homes dipped in February from nearly a two-year high.
More than any other artist, Prince's stature was damaged by the emergence and mass acceptance of hip-hop. Emcees could do the one thing Prince could not: rap. Sampling and looping made Prince's glass-shattering instrumental talent feel slightly anachronistic. The purple pop star went into partial commercial eclipse at the very moment that hip-hop was gathering traction. A series of lackluster albums didn't help. Michael Jackson is more likely to be cited as an inspiration to contemporary musicians than Prince is. Jackson, alas, is no longer here to entertain us. Prince, remarkably, remains at the height of his powers. He's a national treasure. Catch him while you can.
If Karn's team can identify what it takes for the virus to maintain that dormant state -- or as he calls it, "what's keeping the lid on the pot" -- they hope to figure out how to reverse latency, or prevent it from happening in the first place.
Neeson was told that they would film in 20-below conditions in British Columbia. "Dermot told me that was actually nothing compared to Chicago weather," Neeson jokes.
Ryan dropped out of the project in 2009, citing market conditions -- collapsing real estate prices, skittish lenders -- and the cost of cleaning up the residue of four decades of making bombs and bullets. The U.S. Army already has spent almost $200 million cleaning up much of the site for industrial uses, and a future owner would have to spend more to prepare the land for residential development.
Federal authorities said two of the men posed as telephone workers with hard hats, tool belts and fluorescent vests and walked into Landrieu's office in a New Orleans federal building Monday. A federal law enforcement official said Wednesday one of the hard hats was rigged with a tiny camera. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.

Overdraft protection may sound enticing – it means the bank will lend you money if you overdraw your account – but it's expensive and fees can multiply rapidly into hundreds of dollars.
More than 2.7 million homes and businesses in Southern California, Arizona and Mexico were left in the dark in September after a transmission line that sends electricity from Arizona to California failed. The line failure destabilized nearby power grids and caused several power plants to shut down, creating "cascading outages," the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in a report following an eight-month review of the incident.
Hope was diagnosed last October with Hajdu-Cheney Syndrome, a rare connective tissue disorder, her mother said.

Here the critical bridge -- the necessary overlap to relate past decades to the present -- were keywords that were associated with others before they faded. In other words, they performed the same bridging function Justice Potter Stewart did. Such techniques connected an 1880 paper on orangutan brains with a 1976 paper on monkey brains.

Q: Hey, Tony: If I'm Peyton Manning in the new overtime format I would prefer that the opponent kick a field goal on the first possession. Then I'm hoping my returner takes a knee in the end zone -- I don't want to risk a fumble. I'll take it on the 20 -- gladly! Why? I now have unlimited time, and I always have four downs to tie, or most likely, win. I never have to spike it, I don't have to go out of bounds, I can run on any down, they can't go in to a prevent, etc., etc. Tom Brady probably feels the same way. Maybe Jake Delhomme does, too. My question: Why won't smart coaches almost always choose to kick? Which is fine I guess, except that it defeats the very purpose of the change in the first place. I think people who laugh this off are making a molehill out of a mountain. -- Steve Davies, Cleveland
Brandon Garcia started for the Trojans and threw 79 pitches before being pulled in favor of Nootbaar to start the fifth. Garcia took the loss to drop to 3-4. He allowed seven hits and three runs — just one earned — while issuing one walk with no strikeouts.
Corgan said it best at this morning's hearing: "This issue is one of fundamental fairness. If the performance of a song has value to a particular terrestrial radio station in its airing, I believe it is only right to compensate those performers who have created this work. Simply put, if a station plays a song, both the author and the performer should be paid. These particular performances must have value to the stations or they wouldn't be playing them."

But while most recipes call for serving the broth first, with meat and vegetables following, Manrique says this is not the custom in his home. Instead, the fork-tender meats and vegetables come to the table on a warm platter and the hot broth accompanies them in a tureen. At the table, each diner gets a soup bowl with some of the meat, some of the vegetables, and a ladle of hot broth over all. Toasts spread with poached marrow are also part of the picture, as is a sauce curiously named gros sel (coarse salt). Resembling sauce gribiche, Manrique's gros sel is a mustardy vinaigrette with chopped herbs, cornichons and hard-boiled egg.

The suicide of Seau, 43, sent shock waves through the sports world, which struggled to make sense of the death of a pro football icon who ostensibly had it all — good looks, a superhero's build, adoring fans, fame, money and a happy-go-lucky habit of greeting friends and strangers alike with a gregarious, "Hey, buddy!"

While they may spend less individually than the Donald Trumps of the world, average households are better job creators because there are so many more of them. Inventing a better mousetrap (or even leveraging the buyout of the mousetrap company) is great, but you also need the people with money in their pockets to beat a path to your door.

Fools celebrating by firing guns into the air is more pronounced on New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July. But the term random gunfire  shooting for the sake of shooting  is a mainstay of the evening news. A fool with a gun is a fool with a gun, whether it's a holiday or not.

"You know, the funny thing is that I putted really well and I drove it OK," Erdmann said. "But ball-striking, I had no clue where the ball was going. I didn't know if it was going left or right. Nerves obviously compounded the issue."
According to the Better Hearing Institute, a nonprofit corporation focused on hearing loss awareness and education, 65 percent of people 65 and younger have some degree of hearing loss. This includes 1 in 6 baby boomers, 1 in 14 Generation Xers and 1.4 million youths age 18 and younger.
On the bad days, it rains, and it's just Mom, Cole and Bailey in a two-bedroom, 800-square-foot apartment. Nowhere to go and no car to get there, everyone on top of one another.

A James Beard Award semifinalist for best new restaurant, Harvest takes up the "farm-to-table" concept with utter sincerity and boasts an impressive seasonal cocktail menu to match. Heavy on the organic spirits, the cocktails are almost as high-minded as the food, but the concept isn't overly serious: A menu was printed on the back of a Habitat for Humanity envelope. Actually, maybe that is kind of serious. (624 E. Market St.; 1-502-384-9090; harvestlouisville.com.)
Brooks says he needs to raise $15 million to build a community center for the youth and families of Woodlawn and Englewood.
Gene Wojciechowski, ESPN.com: "Gone are the defending national champions. Gone are all the ribeye-juicy storylines between UConn and Kentucky. Huskies coach Jim Calhoun, whose feud with UK coach John Calipari goes back decades, would have given his tonsils to send the Wildcats to an early spring break. But Iowa State has its own story to tell. Chapter One: Why Kentucky Had Better Not Overlook Us. UConn did. Or at least it played like it did."
"I find it ironic that I was invited by the County Council to speak before them on matters of police procedures, which turned into a discussion on corruption and dirty politics in county government, and Councilman Grasso pulls a stunt like that," Davis, who has asked for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into alleged police misconduct, said in a statement. "Corruption exists in government when employees are afraid to come forward at the risk of being bullied, intimidated or embarrassed publicly."
Penalties, another part of Raiders football, again were abundant. Oakland was penalized 15 times for 92 yards, including a delay-of-game call in the second quarter that erased a perfectly executed 36-yard shovel pass for an apparent touchdown to Brandon Myers on a fake field-goal attempt.

In his rebuttal argument, Wagstaffe said, "The defense has attempted to shift the blame for any actions he (Rose) took" but said the case "is about a defendant hitting a police officer."
That said, the important thing now is not to judge whether City Hall should have seen this coming but to find a path forward that continues a popular event and increases the likelihood that taxpayers' initial investment in the race pays off. The $1.2 million the city is owed in taxes and reimbursement for police and fire services, among other things, is just a fraction of the investment Baltimore made in this race, including millions in traffic-clogging street repairs. The only way Baltimore can recoup its investment is if the race goes forward for the next several years.

Two of Karah’s friends decided to honor her by creating two small sheds with retractable roofs to house additional telescopes at the Paul Robeson Observatory, home of the New Jersey Astronomical Association. In order to accomplish this goal, Genevieve Schweikert and Stephanie Linzer need to raise $3,200 so that others can also enjoy the stars up close. Donations of materials and labor are also needed. Schweikert and Linzer started the process of getting the necessary permits shortly after Karah passed away.

It will be interesting to see how things turn out for everyone over the next few weeks — does Jack think that going to Montreal will some how make him look less guilty? How many people will Victoria frame to try to save Daniel? Where exactly is Amanda hiding? And most importantly, how will Emily make this work out in her plan? If the plan is to ruin Victoria, putting the only person in the world Victoria loves in jail for life would seem to be successful, but I don’t think Emily wants Daniel in jail. All of the other suspects (Amanda, Jack) are people Emily cares for, and Daniel appears to be joining this list.

Hey, Joe: I can't cite you the amount of cap room the Browns have going into 2012, but I do know they are comfortably under.

One change is that beginning in 2013, teams will be required to spend a higher minimum (floor) than previously. That will force historically low-paying teams (Tampa Bay, Cincinnati, etc.) to upgrade their player payroll to abide by the new rules.

He needs to do a death metal album, or collaborate with Lil Jon. Well, yes, that would be horrible, but it might switch his lightbulb back on.

Secret daughter Dana first meets her grandmother Bunny on the day the older woman is dying, and on that day, her father hugs her in public.

Haiti's geological vulnerability is also its promise. Massive tectonic plates squeeze the island with horrifying consequences, but deep cracks between them form convenient veins for gold, silver and copper pushed up from the hot innards of the planet. Prospectors from California to Chile know earthquake faults often have, quite literally, a golden lining.
The compass system of a Canadair regional jet malfunctioned after takeoff, but began working after a passenger turned off an iPhone, USA Today reported in December after a review of government and airline documents.

Look, there's no question that technology has made music cheaper and more accessible. But I wonder if it hasn't been made less sacred. The ease with which we can hear any song at any moment we want no matter where we are (and often for free) has diluted the very act of listening, rendering it just another channel on our ever-expanding dial of distractions.

There was a correlation between high religiosity and generosity. But for the less-religious, whether or not they'd seen the child-poverty video influenced their levels of giving. Meanwhile, the video had no such influence on the more-religious participants. The researchers theorized that, lacking a framework encouraging "pro-social" behavior, less-religious people are motivated more by personality traits and the emotion of a situation.

"No matter what her outcome, whether it's very positive or not so positive, he's going to be in this for the long haul.

Bond was the best thing that never happened to me. I honestly was not in the running, even though the more I said so, the more people thought I had it in the bag. What's so funny is that my career in Britain was in really bad shape at that time, but my agents pretty much built me a new one in America by playing up all the Bond stories. All I had to do was keep on telling people I was never going to be Bond.

CB Corey Webster. We were waiting for the elevators to go down to the postgame locker room when safeties coach David Merritt yelled out to no one in particular, “Game ball, Corey Webster.” Considering on Mondays Merritt has to break down the game film and then start working on the next opponent, I’d say he has no time to read this blog, so he must have meant a real game ball. Still, I’ll oblige for a guy who has helped keep Larry Fitzgerald, Sidney Rice and Stevie Johnson to a total of 16 catches for 132 yards combined over the past three weeks. (That’s excluding Fitzgerald’s leaping 47-yarder over Deon Grant.)

"I don't want to farm out police at all. Either the half cent sales tax would be approved, or there will be a very small choice and drastic measures that will happen in the second half of the year," he said. "To cut five to 10 percent from employees does not work. Most of the output is personnel. Most of that is public safety.

Doctors say over-the-counter medicines like Claritin, Zyrtec and Allegra (or their generic versions) can help, and they don't cause drowsiness, as do antihistamines such as Benadryl.

You should avoid products that work by vascular constriction -- such as Afrin nasal spray or Visine. Those can create reliance and a rebound effect.

With so many combinations, it's impossible to re-create each dish properly. Some classics such as pad thai ($9.95), basil salmon ($12.95) and tom kha gai ($8.95), a mildly spicy soup with sliced chicken and coconut milk, still have that classic balance, but other dishes are disjointed, and ingredients don't seem as fresh as they should.

With so much to see around Sedona, it seems a shame to spend an afternoon grunting in pain and cursing in the midday sun. Maybe that's why the hike up the A.B. Young Trail in Oak Creek Canyon is so frustrating.
Massey is under intense scrutiny now because 29 miners are dead. And Massey's methods ought to raise serious concerns about whether the regulatory regime is strong enough to withstand the tactics of other potentially unscrupulous mine owners.
Explorers first reported the site of Xultun, once a large Maya center, in 1915. But it was only two years ago that National Geographic Society-funded archaeologists noted a small residential room partly exposed by looters. The room's walls proved to hold murals and small, delicate hieroglyphs inscribed in rows between paintings of scribes and rulers that not only corresponded to a 260 day ceremonial calendar and 365-day year, but the 584-day sky track of Venus and 780-day one of Mars.

The objection to same-sex marriage is mean-spirited and should be dismissed with dispatch. Gay marriage doesn't detract in the slightest from traditional marriage, and American society should embrace it and move on.
However, there are so many under- and unexamined "You must never go to these places!!!" attitudes that I think the "controlling" tag is premature until she does the hard thinking about her beliefs.

Sometimes, in fact, pets may be sold short by more "natural" and healthful-seeming options. A January review of five raw dog and cat food diets in the Canadian Veterinary Journal — two commercial and three homemade — found that three out of the five were low in calcium and phosphorus and two were deficient in potassium, magnesium and zinc. The authors concluded that raw food may hypothetically be a nutritional risk for pets (though better studies are needed) and that it may also pose a risk of infectious disease to both pets and people.
He was convicted, but on appeal he wanted that statement thrown out because he said he invoked his Miranda rights by being uncommunicative with the interrogating officers.

There is more than one way to create food at this level. And while there is no disputing San Francisco is a world-class food city, we are seeing the first signs of a backlash there  some chefs and foodies are lamenting the lock-step insistence on a farm-to-table philosophy that can become a crutch that leads to conservative, predictable cooking.

But while that nearly hands-off approach might deliver salad to your table, it's not ideal for somebody who wants a parade of leafy stuff for half the year. The ideal greens garden doesn't demand a ton of work, but it does require a fair bit of strategy.

Phil Waters of St. Mary’s of the Immaculate Conception, a Roman Catholic church in Newark, "for people (illegal immigrants) to be able to come forward, admit they’ve been in the country without papers, be able to prove good character, and be able to find a way to be here permanently."
And she found it. After partnering with writer Jonathan Stark, Newman got her first staff writing job on "Cheers" in 1991. In 1994, they landed on "Ellen," staying for four seasons and winning an Emmy and the Peabody Award for co-writing Ellen’s groundbreaking coming-out episode. After a development stint with ABC/Disney, Newman and Stark created "According to Jim," which Newman left when it was sold into syndication. By then, she was feeling "young" at 63 and decided to pursue her singer/songwriter ambitions.

Sitting at the dining-room table of his sister's home in Belair-Edison, last year's Baltimore Sun Metro Boys Player of the Year flashes a smile that lights up the room — just as it lights up gyms, whether he's sinking a 3-pointer, jawing with refs or getting to his feet after a flagrant foul from an opponent.

That number might be a bit optimistic, said Dr. John Fung, director of the Cleveland Clinic's Transplantation Center and chairman of the Clinic's Digestive Disease Institute. "But even if there are 10 donors, that would save 10 lives," he said.
"Just our rotation," Thibodeau said. "Whenever you move somebody into something else, you're taking somebody out. So who are you taking out? Our starting unit didn't play well. And our bench didn't play well. You're looking at everything — execution, why you win or lose. You evaluate everything."

And as "Bertie" begins his therapy, there's a need for him to get over this. Bertie is the duke of York, younger brother to the prince of Wales, and he has speaking engagements. But when his shallow, playboy brother abdicates, Bertie's speaking calendar will only fill up as he becomes king. When Britain is plunged into World War II, a speech by the king to rally the nation is a big deal. Every ear in the empire will hang on every word of "The King's Speech."

No. To protect the mattress, I use an impervious outer cover. If you look at a mattress, it collects debris by gravity. All kinds of things collect on it that are absorbed into its core. Without the impervious cover, your mattress is a "zoological and botanical garden," he says. The outer covers are made of pliable, plastic vinyl and are commonly used by people with asthma and allergy symptoms. The covers should also go on pillowcases. "If you put an impervious outer cover over the mattress and mattress pad, your mattress won't harm you."

“We knew Derrick Rose was a good offensive player,” Batum said. “But you have to play defense, too. He can’t guard Dre. You gotta play defense. He can’t play defense.”
Maybe it’s just a case of like recognizing like. Martin may sometimes sing like Thom Yorke, but in his restless, omnivorous appetite for pop, he’s far closer to West than he is to Radiohead. Hook recognition is one of his best assets — and the first thing he recognizes about pop hooks is that they often fit best secondhand.
I realized I'd not only requested he insult me three different times, but probably proved his point in the process.
10. X-Files (1998): Sure, it didn't grab viewers like the first two seasons of the TV show did, but watch this first movie again and you'll see that it's a pretty solid effort.
And to make the most of summer's bounty - as well as to add a green vegetable - we used the jambalaya as a stuffing for roasted zucchini. The mixture would be equally delicious stuffed into a hollowed-out tomato or bell pepper. Round out the meal with a green salad and crusty French bread.

Spain's contribution to bubbly has taken on such a popular identity of its own that its 1970 decision to abandon the term "Champaña" can be judged a wise one. Cava means "cellar" in Catalan, and if inexpensive fizz like Prosecco is made quick and cheap in a closed tank, Cava signals a Spanish commitment to do things the hard way - retaining traditional Champagne-style winemaking for a wine that rarely tops $15. Though Cava hinges on its own unique trio of grapes - Macabeo, Parellada, Xarel-lo - Chardonnay joined the ranks in 1986 and Pinot Noir is now allowed as well. Beyond the biggest names, Freixenet and Cordoniu, lies a proliferation of smaller producers making distinctive wines.

But Ross can't forget, really. It falls to him, after all, to carry the flag for what should be the latest industry-saving series of films, and it's something he has known since the minute he said yes to the job. The director of "Seabiscuit" and "Pleasantville" knew this was something different, something bigger, that the scrutiny of millions of fanatical readers of the book would be turned upon him and his film.
Higher gas prices generally don't help the broader U.S. economy, even though they force people to spend more. The additional money seldom pays for higher salaries or new jobs. The United States does supply a portion of the oil consumed here. But the majority is produced overseas, so most of the money leaves the country.
The Missouri House already has passed an equally narrow-minded bill to stop our Highway Patrol from offering drivers license exams in any language but English. As your friends at Mercedes know, many companies hire legal immigrants to perform important jobs in this country. Some of them speak and understand their native languages much better than English. That's why Missouri, like many other states, offers drivers tests in different languages. Also, the Highway Patrol says it makes the roads safer.

Silvey has been highly critical of the method Gov. Jay Nixon has chosen to pay for the state's share of disaster related expenses.

This week, a film made from one of Blume's books, "Tiger Eyes," debuted at the Palm Beach Film Festival in Florida. There have been television adaptations before, but nothing for the big screen.

The 4 percent limit was imposed in 2007 by then-Gov. Jon Corzine and the Legislature, which allowed temporary exemptions for scheduled pension payments and pay raises in existing contracts. Other items, such as health care costs and debt payments, were permanently outside the limit. Where the state’s judgment comes in is deciding whether "extraordinary" circumstances — like skyrocketing energy costs or opening a new school — qualify for a waiver. And while school districts have to fit within specific categories of need, towns can also claim any purpose that is "essential to protect or promote the public health, safety or welfare."
The government's new labeling laws will allow manufacturers to use the term "broad spectrum" only if the product provides equal protection against UVB and UVA rays and has an SPF of 15 or higher.

As for checked bags, United, which charges $25 each way for the first bag and $35 for the second, applies its allowance to each seat. So if you book two seats and check two bags, your fees will total $50 instead of $60. Delta Air Lines has a similar policy. But Southwest, which doesn't charge for the first two bags, says that whether you occupy one or two seats, you can take only two bags for free.

Does Lozano really believe that DeWitt and Mozeliak will cave and come up with 10 years and $250 million or more? The Cardinals have roster needs, especially with outfielder Allen Craig on the mend from major knee surgery. If Pujols doesn't want their money, the Cardinals can put it to work by signing other players. They can make a run at outfielder Carlos Beltran and perhaps a shortstop. They'd have more payroll flexibility.

It's a sad mix of history and decay that hangs over Second Avenue. Dilapidated properties like the Robert N.

But when ideology disappears, all that's left to believe in is "love and money, and you'd better have one or the other." But Jian's nihilism may manifest itself in steeling himself up to kill regardless of consequence, but it is exactly those consequences -- the fate of his daughter -- that allows for personification. The scarred contemporary landscape of China created his veneer, but having to function in the greater existential nightmare of a Western world is what restores Jian's humanity, little by little.

On immigration reform, the Republican candidates for governor – Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman – come up short.

I now feel like there is an epidemic of social isolation amongst kids in middle school. So when we began to talk to folks about the fact that this was something that Lili really went through, other people just jumped on the idea, and it began to pick up a lot of traction.

About 20% of the slopes are suitable for beginners, 50% for intermediates and 30% for those in the "advanced/expert" category — a more beginner-friendly mix than at many of the 13 major resorts in Utah. The most ambitious Solitude skiers gravitate toward Honeycomb Canyon, which includes about 400 acres of lift-accessible, off-piste terrain. Begin at the top of the Summit lift and you have a 3.2-mile blue odyssey (that is, mostly intermediate difficulty) to the bottom of the Eagle Express lift.
