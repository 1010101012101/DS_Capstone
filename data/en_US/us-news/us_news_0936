Below the knee. Please. Her Majesty (HM) never deviates from this one; neither can I find any pictorial evidence to suggest that, since being crowned, she ever has. Hemlines may have risen and fallen, but the queen's skirt and dress length has remained resolutely and strictly the same. Very sensible: flattering and safe in one go. Hoik it up an inch and it could work for you, too. For the best skirt and dress lengths this season, try Jil Sander (pictured).

But what's the script for surviving walking while black? Never wear a hoodie? That's the same blame-the-victim garbage heaped on rape victims. Genuflect when confronted by a stranger? Absurd. And if you're pursued? Run? Stand your ground? Confront your pursuer? Call for help? Whether Trayvon tried to do any of these, all of these, he still ended up dead.

It got more convoluted when he asked my political affiliation. “It depends,” I told him. Some years I vote Democrat. Some years I vote Republican. He hesitated. I sensed that his questionnaire couldn’t cope with voters who refuse to be tied to one party. That’s too bad, especially since the Republican Party has unofficially split, with tea party types often sniping at moderates. To say I vote Republican hints that I’m a tea party backer. I’m not, I stated clearly, but I wonder what the pollster wrote down.
He cited his success with that bipartisan approach in Washington, particularly on the House budget committee, and said he was a proven negotiator.

Babby is not looking for shortcuts to please them. As much as he hopes that two years of retaining flexibility will pay off this summer, Babby warned that the Suns might not use their salary-cap space if it is not prudent. After missing the playoffs in successive seasons for the first time in 24 years, the Suns might ask for more patience rather than misspend or make decisions that don't fit the goal of becoming a team that annually competes for championships.

Achillea millefolium, common yarrow, is a spreader, but its cultivars are better behaved. Lysimachia (including L. clethroides, gooseneck loosestrife, and L. punctata, yellow loosestrife) are rampant growers. Macleaya, the plume poppy, is a wonderful tall architectural plant, but it is aggressive. M. cordata is better behaved than M. microcarpa. Among the campanulas, watch out for C. persicifolia, and in the euphorbia family, take care with E. cyparissias.

Fellow engineer David Bonowitz, who chairs a code recommendation committee on existing buildings for the Structural Engineers Association of Northern California, says that all codes imply specific performance objectives. "Identify a risk, quantify it, and mitigate it -- that's the procedure," he says. "The first goal is to prevent death during an earthquake. But beyond life safety, is the building designed to be usable 24 hours after the quake? Or is it designed to even be repairable? That's the next issue. Getting that extra performance from older buildings is rare."

Abraham Lincoln, on the night after Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender ended the Civil War, delivered from the window of the White House a speech that mentioned his own achievements not at all, but instead looked forward to the difficulties of reconstruction and called for black suffrage—a call that would doom him because the audience outside the White House included a man who muttered that Lincoln had just delivered his last speech. It was John Wilkes Booth.
The shortages are caused primarily by problems with sterility and other serious issues that have led to shutdowns of production lines and occasionally entire factories. In addition, consolidation among generic drug manufacturers, as well as manufacturers deciding to end production of marginally profitable drugs, has led to decreased capacity. That means when one manufacturer suddenly stops production, the small number of others making a drug can't quickly pick up slack.
Almost nothing could have happened against the Titans on Sunday that would have tainted the best season in franchise history. The Texans, who finished 10-6, should be proud.

First there was the draw that put him in post No. 1 in a 20-horse field. In recent years, you could give a jock a rocket launcher, a hand grenade and a broad sword and he still couldn’t fight his way off the rail into the first turn. Then Lookin At Lucky got slammed by all that horseflesh squeezing for the territorial imperative. At one point he was 18th in the field and, miraculously, he wound up a battered sixth.
The 50th annual Spring Parade of Homes is an opportunity to discover all the innovations and options available in today’s new homes.

This is the most glamorous dining room in town, and you'll feel pampered as you gaze out on the leafy expanse of Jamison Square. Jake Martin, formerly of Carlyle, has transformed the restaurant from a mediocre bistro to a palace of sumptuous, innovative, beautifully prepared dishes that blend the Northwest and France. The recipes are never orthodox, but strive for painterly aesthetics and surprising marriages of ingredients, as his cooking transforms the mundane into the sublime at every turn. Like so many young chefs, Martin loves high-end ingredients like foie gras, and low, formerly disposable ones like the meat from the head of pigs, here turned into a delicious pâté fried in panko. One of the pleasures of dining at Fenouil is to see how Martin's transformational cooking works to create elegant surprises.

Her husband goes down, while Grace makes it onto a boat with 38 others. The lifeboat is overloaded and rides too low on the water, a fact everyone tries to ignore until, by day eight, they realize that no one is coming to their rescue.

The Buccaneers have been extremely active in free agency this offseason and have actually done a nice job plugging some of the bigger holes. Drafting Claiborne here, though, will also shore up a secondary that will eventually lose Ronde Barber, who is 37.

One line of the report especially stands out in that context. It notes that culturally divergent counties have all succeeded not simply by changing how teachers are trained, supported and paid, but by fostering a very different attitude about education and educators.

Granted, assessing property value is not an easy business, and those who tackle this duty seldom win a lot of popularity contests.

The governor, meanwhile, postures as a reluctant partner in a state takeover that promises to deliver many of the Republican Party's most treasured policy goals up on a gilded platter: privatization of city services, restriction of collective bargaining rights for public unions and fiscal austerity. The fact that Bing, nominally a Democrat, has spent most of his term promoting these same goals should make anyone deeply suspicious of the made-for-TV infighting between the mayor and the governor.

Imagine what would happen if one day (Earth Day, perhaps?) everyone decided to make a pledge to leave their car keys at home for all trips under 5 miles, a distance that can easily be covered by biking or walking.

The first single from Alpocalypse is the Lady Gaga parody "Perform This Way." This song has had its fair share of controversy – suffice it to say that after a number of crossed wires and a crazy media firestorm, all is well – now it has Lady Gaga’s full approval and blessing.

How silly of me. A couple of you pointed out one step that makes carrot cake much easier: Leave out the carrots. Well, technically there are carrots in your recipes. But you simply grab a couple of jars of pureed baby food carrots and forgo the process of grating carrots.

The contemporary scenes, shot in cooler colors with fixed camera angles, are more subdued and emotionally detached.

The plan redivides the city into five wards from four wards and expands the City Council to 10 from eight seats, with two council members representing each ward.

Wurzelbacher says he is gauging public interest in his candidacy and plans to announce a decision on Oct. 25.
James views Jordan as an icon, which means he doesn't have to fill the shoes or follow in the footsteps. Even if he did, if a great player is not permitted to follow Jordan because he'll never be Jordan, then how are the Bulls ever supposed to win again? An NBA franchise is allowed to have legends at different times. Bill Russell, Larry Bird. Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant.
The Assembly approved six contracts covering more than 50,000 state workers - among them prison guards, scientists and engineers - on a largely party-line vote. The contracts bill now moves to Gov.

"I've been frozen in time. I'm glad somebody will look into this now."
Hey, Tony: What do you think of Cribbs' reaction to your question concerning special teams at the end of the game? I'm wondering if part of his frustration was a byproduct of apparently not being where he was supposed to be on a deep throw in the first half. It brings up the $60 million question once again: Are the receivers not getting open and/or are they not sure where to be, or is McCoy just throwing inaccurately and/or not reading the defenses correctly? -- John Neiswander, Berthoud, Colo.
Lariviere had ignored his superiors before. Pernsteiner called him on the carpet last fall for allowing classified employees to work overtime to offset losses in furlough days.

Together, the city and county estimated the project would cost $15.5 million. It actually cost $10 million, so the county has proposed spending the unused money on widening the northwest portion of the road from Northwest Quatama Road to Northwest Aloclek Drive.

A: I've been impressed with the tech support in Hazelwood. For example, the staff refreshes the computers so we can keep using them. As for the kids, we have to remember that 15 minutes after classes let out, students deal with more technology than they've seen all day in school. We have used Facebook to send snow day messages to the kids.
Since 1992, Bunim/Murray has engaged and enlisted the youth of America into the social experiment known as “The Real World.” The cast of the 28th season of “The Real World” will have a unique opportunity to be stars of the most iconic, longest running reality series on television.

Nowadays, outings like these are no longer a ritual, but Solstice is ideal when the mood strikes. On a recent rainy Saturday night, for example, the only thing that sounded good was comfort food and a drink. A steaming bowl of Gorgonzola mac 'n' cheese ($8) -- capped with an unlikely but fitting crust of shredded apples and walnut dust -- and a side of tender Brussels sprouts ($6) hit the spot.
Chase described Cordes’ pursuit of his client as “malodorous,” “vicious,” and “mean-spirited” and confidently predicted that she would be reversed on appeal.

While a number of residences can only be enjoyed from the outside, visitors can appreciate the Spanish Revival style both inside and out at several structures, including the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History, which opened its current home in 1932. (To appreciate the plants and ecosystems—and native cultures—that were flourishing when the Spaniards arrived, be sure to check out the newly updated Native Plant Garden.) The Cypress Inn in Carmel may be best known for celebrity owner Doris Day and her pet-friendly policies, but it was built in 1929 at the height of the Spanish Revival trend with high-beamed ceilings, hand-painted tiles, arched windows, an ornate Moorish facade and other details lovingly preserved in a recent remodeling.

This production is also especially good at expertly building tension around situations (like the long-awaited Potter-Voldemort showdown) that anyone who knows the books knows the outcome of. Another satisfaction, and the key to creating emotion, is the kind of strong acting that the end of a story often calls forth. Though many do well (including an especially effective John Hurt as wand maker Ollivander), it is Alan Rickman as the elusive Severus Snape who, as always, makes the most lasting impression.
Galvanized by the debate over the Coyote Hills development in Fullerton, Cha in 2004 became a member of the city's Redevelopment Design Review Committee. Before that, during the 10th anniversary of the L.A. riots, he'd served as president of the Korean American Grocers Association.

I, however, am skeptical. The man doesn’t even own a computer, and the 3,000 or so meals he’ll prepare for the holiday are tracked in pencil. But Dworkin merely says, "No problem." By the end of our interview, I have no doubt he’ll pull it off.
Stores are already being squeezed by rising costs for materials and labor. Returns make it worse. When you return a sweater, a paid worker has to restock it. Return a computer after just turning it on, and the hard drive has to be scrubbed.
Wildife experts believe that except for a small collection of the large cats in Florida, cougars — also known as mountain lions, pumas or panthers — are extinct on the East Coast, and that most reported sightings are simply a case of mistaken identity.

We were neighbors during our last year in school. I was renting a house with my girlfriend. Jim had an apartment down the street. One day he brought a friend over to the house. The young man was of Mexican ancestry and was visiting from Los Angeles. He seemed very hip, very cool. He asked me if I had heard the song by War that began, "The Cisco Kid was a friend of mine."
she said. "But I guess I'm a little bored with how I've been dressing." She said she was in a rut of beiges and brown. She needs orthotics, so her typical footwear is bland walking sneakers. Yet Gloria made it clear that she doesn't like "frills" or the idea that women are 'supposed" to dress in some hyper-feminine way. She said that sometimes seductive women's clothing gives a male-dominated world the ammunition to discredit a woman's real worth. She likes to dress well, but on her own terms.
Rookie Blair Walsh has yet to hear from Ryan Longwell. That's not a shock given that Walsh, for all intents and purposes, is positioning himself to steal Longwell's job. The Vikings used a sixth-round selection to nab Walsh, confident the kicker out of Georgia can regain the form he showed in 2009 and '10 when he was an All-Southeastern Conference standout.
I'm with him 100 percent on this one. It's one thing for an opinion piece to use profanity if framed as a discussion about decorum or appropriateness. But simply in service of a gag? My experience tells me many readers would call that a bridge too far for a general-interest newspaper.
Putz, making his first appearance in five days, allowed four runs on five hits whole getting two outs.
The only thing to do -- assuming you can get a table -- is to order a bottle of wine (relax; most of the dozen Italian options are under $30) and sample wildly from the antipasti menu as you contemplate your next move. The portions are small -- four pungent gratinated clams are each the size of your fingernail -- but we're talking $2 a pop, so you can fill a plate without approaching even the price of your wine bottle.
It was a moment that would help chart the course of her life.
"Pretty much everything is half price in Bend," Hallgarten said of the housing market. "We don't see that coming back anytime soon. Certainly for the next two years what will make the Brasada compelling, is making it in a premier destination resort."
He believes in second chances because just weeks before the party, his heart stopped. His home health aide Maribel Cruz from Hospice Care of the West happened to be there and hit his wristband that calls for emergency services. When he woke up in hospital, the doctor offered to implant a pacemaker to kick his heartbeat up from 30 beats a minute. It's now at 70 with the pacemaker.
More often, it seems, Saberhagen or some other briefly dominant pitcher implodes in seven or eight pitches, usually around the eighth inning or ninth inning. Which is when sportswriters' fingers begin angrily hitting the "delete" key while their mouths begin muttering unkind expletives.

I couldn’t get a better start than with a goal.

How the federal government will change its spending patterns to deal with a sky-high deficit is the big wild card for Maryland. The state has long benefited from its location next to D.C.

One used to be able to walk up the pyramid steps and be rewarded with a panoramic view of the former city. But in 2006, the authorities banned climbing to preserve the structure. As a result, one can no longer visit a small temple within El Castillo that contains a captivating sculpture of a jaguar with eyes of jade. Marin tells us there is no jade on the Yucatán and that testing has shown the stone came from the Pacific Northwest, some 3,000 miles away. While visitors are prohibited from clambering among most of the ruins, there are no barriers to approaching, or even touching them. One can still walk among the exquisitely carved Thousand Columns that once supported a massive roof and up the spiral staircase to the top of Carocal, the observatory. From here, the ancient Mayans gazed at and recorded the movements of the stars and planets. Windows point toward the equinox sunsets and the horizon locations where Venus rises.

Now, see, that's exactly the kind of attitude that gets customers riled up. You can't demand that we subsidize your employees' wages and then get testy when we insist on a few ground rules.

After earning four stars from The Chronicle and three stars from Michelin, Meadowood management decided it was time for a fresh approach. They closed for a few months, opening two weeks ago, to improve the already handsome interior and to tweak Christopher Kostow's menu. His tasting menu has a strong sense of place, and his combinations continue to be precise, fresh and unique. He might pair veal breast with hamachi, roast sturgeon with bone marrow, and langoustines with scallops and pork belly.

They know the Canadian government, also eager to get a new crossing built, has offered to contribute Michigan's share of the up-front money to build the bridge, guaranteeing that Michigan taxpayers will have as little of their money at stake as possible. And no one will be evicted from their homes for a new bridge; by law, land acquisition for these kinds of projects comes with remuneration. Often, in an area like Delray, where values are so depressed, property owners bargain for more in a public development project than they would ever get selling their places on the market.

You can pair it with pasta topped with a hearty Bolognese sauce, then continue sipping it when you move on to a dark chocolate dessert.

You also need to find a partner or a group of backcountry skiers willing to take a rookie on board — which can be difficult, especially when lives are on the line. For various reasons, I haven't always had access to all of these things — mountains, mentors or a backcountry crew. A lot of people don't. It's true that there's no substitute for experience, but another truth is that I didn't want to wait years to start ski mountaineering. So last summer I committed myself to skiing the Grand Teton — or at least to trying — and to a serious training regimen, and to fast-tracking my ski mountaineering career.

What troubles Catholics about the Kansas City scandal is not the lack of a policy on the church's part. It's the failure to shift attitudes among the hierarchy.
The first "Ghost Rider" film, directed by Mark Steven Johnson, was sort of a fizzy goof, the kind of movie where you don't expect much and then think, "Hey, that was actually kind of fun."

There are few rules of engagement in political campaigning. Truth, or more accurately the full truth, is the first casualty of campaigning. Misstatements and omissions are carefully crafted by high-priced communication experts and strategists to deliver the message. The universal rule of engagement is to not attack the candidate's family. Candidates use their families to show they are real people. Loving families help deflect the harshness of the attacks on the candidate. They are valuable props.

Each of these works reflects a profound knowledge of Scripture and tradition on the part of the writer, the kind of knowledge found only among those who take them seriously enough to probe the deepest questions in their terms. These texts are not allegories, because in each case the writer has posed a problem within a universe of thought that is fully open to his questioning once its terms are granted. Here the use of biblical allusion is not symbolism or metaphor, which are both rhetorical techniques for enriching a narrative whose primary interest does not rest with the larger resonances of the Bible. In fact these great texts resemble Socratic dialogues in that each venture presupposes that meaning can indeed be addressed within the constraints of the form and in its language, while the meaning to be discovered through this argument cannot be presupposed. Like paintings, they render meaning as beauty.

Why does the Mehlvllle School District need to construct a building or offices and bus parking probably a mile or so away from their headquarters? They seem intent on spending any money they may receive instead of keeping it in reserve.

Beyoncé has no other shows on her schedule. Her pregnancy prevented her from touring hard behind "4," her 2011 set, and while it did go platinum, it was not the sales juggernaut that her "B'Day" or "I Am... Sasha Fierce" albums were. But many critics (including this one) called "4" one of the best albums of the year in any genre, and the highly personal, courageous, and impeccably performed effort continues to win the star respect. "4" is a racy album -- it wouldn't be a Beyoncé set if it wasn't -- but it is also a joyous celebration of love, commitment, marriage, and motherhood. The ambitious, exciting "Countdown," which was co-written by influential R&B singer The-Dream, the '80s pop throwback "Love on Top," which played as a tribute to Whitney Houston, the catchy kiss-off "Best Thing I Never Had," and hyperactive feminist anthem "Run the World (Girls)" were among the singles from the set.

Ralph Llewellyn Glew was always an active scholar of and builder of trains and sailing ships. He was in love with older sailing vessels and had a large collection of books on naval history all of which he had read. As soon as he was old enough he joined the U.S. Navy and considered himself lucky to be stationed on a ship near Japan. His love of ships was not diminished by his love of trains.
