It's hard to imagine now, but before the birth of my first child, I had never held a baby. Not once, not in my entire life. No baby at home to tend, no niece or nephew to babysit. So you can imagine, the day my first boy was born I felt woefully unprepared.

Then he continued, talking truthfully about the everyday indignities he put up with, saying, "The meaner the man be, the more you smile, although you're crying on the inside."

Two people were hanging by the window sills of the upper stories of the building opposite ... and then they said part of the back wall of the Victoria had broken (off the 6th and 5th stories) and crashed through the adjoining frame houses, killing a woman and fatally injuring three others. I then noticed in my room that nearly all the plaster of the ceiling had fallen, some of the chunks were close on to three feet in diameter, and the pieces were nearly all round, almost circular in form. I also saw that my bed had moved into the middle of the room -- 2 to 3 feet from the wall where it stood.

While it seems like the concerns are purely emanating from a developmental concern for making the best game possible, the crowded fall-winter 2012 release window (particularly for shooters) does also make some business sense, even if it means missing out on the holiday sales boon. Levine boldly states that Irrational is “doing things nobody has ever done in a first-person shooter.” Perhaps the icing on the cake for the developers is that there’s no danger of “Infinite” now being lost in the shuffle.

Yet it seems only a matter of time before the market evaporates for all of these costly editions. For families with a computer that's always connected to the Internet, free or low-cost research materials online provide an alternative that's at least as convenient and far more up to date.

If the storytelling is a tad ponderous and not particularly clear (this unwieldy book has felled many an adapter, including the dull recent miniseries starring William Hurt), there's no complaint with the way Fisher (working with co-writer Sara Gorsky) frames everything so that the focus is on the performances and the performances alone.

Illinois erected a platform that stood about six feet above the Assembly Hall floor Thursday. It meant that when John Groce, the school's new men's basketball coach, stood at a lectern on that platform, he loomed like a dean of discipline over reporters, who were sitting right below at orchestra-pit level. Beyond the media were about 200 orange- or blue-clad fans. The only way they could've been more excited is if someone had presented them with scientific proof that Illinois was what they knew it to be in their hearts: just about the greatest thing ever!

"I don't consider it work," she said. "It's a hobby and passion for me because I love making a difference by using my unique strengths."
"There's a lot to be said for handmade publishing," Mirk says, stacking her copies of "In Defense of L.A." and heading out the door.
"We'll get as much gear as we can in the water, but the forecast doesn't look good," Collins said. "The gear has got to soak at least 24 hours before you pick it up and have crab in it. It will be pushing it to go back out Sunday. By Tuesday they're expecting southerly winds and 20-foot swells. We've lost boats and guys before in that kind of weather. It might be Thursday before we go back out."

Volt prices start at $40,280, but a smart customer would ignore that figure and concentrate on the three-year monthly lease payment of $350. That's comparable to what you might pay for a conventional car. The Volt I tested had a few options and would lease for $389 a month. Both leases assume $2,500 down and include the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.
And in the third and final section, at last the movie moves into the romantic genre it has been avoiding (and its audience has been wishing for) all along. Bardem shows up as an ex-pat Brazilian, sambas start on the soundtrack, and finally he takes Roberts’ hand and murmurs, “It’s time.”
One day, when a workman was doing stone work, Ms. Quinlan noticed in the pile a large rectangular slab that looked to her like a perfect bench seat. She knew right then she wanted to have it inscribed with an adage that her parents had adopted as the "mantra for their marriage," as Ms. Quinlan puts it. They first heard an approximation of it uttered in Norwegian in the 1962 Jack Lemmon / Lee Remick film, "Days of Wine and Roses." It translates roughly to "Always together, even in heaven."
This wondrous activity is known as browsing. (And yes, smarty-pants, I know that you can do it in a library, too.) Browsing's beauty is that you'll find books that you never knew existed. For example, I was browsing the other day when I saw "American Nerd: The Story of My People." This struck me as a fine title for a book, despite the fact that I am not, repeat, NOT a nerd.
Wagstaffe said he is "pleased" that Rose was convicted of deterring an officer because it means that the jury believes police were acting lawfully during the Dec. 30 protest.

SEC Freshman of the Year: Terrence Jones, Kentucky
Jones says she continues placing low-wage temps with companies that don't follow through with permanent hiring. Instead, Jones said, "Employers are utilizing temp staffing much longer than in the past. Unfortunately what we see is a volume of the work on the lower pay scales, in entry-level manufacturing but not at the management level."

"Whatever you want," Jim said. "It's your hair."
But the fun doesn’t stop there. Nevada’s version is loaded with all sorts of misdirection running plays that mirror those found in the spread-option. But because the quarterback is closer to the line of scrimmage, other dimensions are added, such as the fly sweep. From the Pistol, the wrinkles Nevada employs are virtually endless, making this a special preparation for the Ducks.
That horse could be named Mark Valeski.
Cushing took all the hits - the ridicule, the scorn, the disdain - after his suspension and down year and never flinched. He simply returned this year with a vengeance.
One sparkler in particular he suggests is Roederer Estate in Anderson Valley, owned by famed champagne producer Louis Roederer, maker of the luxury brand Cristal. To be clear, Cristal's California cousin is not champagne, but it's also around $20-$22. "If you're thinking, 'Let's grab a couple bottles of champagne,' well with tax that's over $100," said McCaulley. "For the same price you can show up with five bottles of Roederer sparkling wine and you'll look magnanimous and everybody will love it."

Samaranch, left a complex and controversial legacy when he died Wednesday at age 89.
Pritchett said instead of retaining students in the region, further decreasing those students’ choices in South Jersey will encourage them to pursue opportunities outside the state.

So far it hasn't mattered whether a Democrat or a Republican is in the White House or which party is controlling Congress. President George W. Bush failed to get reform through in 2006 when his party was in charge and failed again in 2007 after the Democrats took over. President Barack Obama campaigned on immigration reform in 2008 but even with his vocal support and commanding Democratic majorities, a long-anticipated bill has yet to be introduced in the Senate. Partisan divisions are so steep that compromises have been impossible on any issue, let alone one as complicated and bulky as comprehensive immigration reform.
The two chatted for several minutes, ironing out any concerns Crawford may have had following the Blazers’ Saturday night victory over the Atlanta Hawks.

Second, by limiting "screen time" — the time kids spend in front of the computer/TV/cell phone, etc. — from an early age, parents can discourage the dependence so many teens have on social networking sites like Facebook. If teens have multiple social outlets, then cyber-bullying can't be as powerful.
How does your family feel about you airing so much personal history -- yours, but by extension theirs also -- so publicly?
Baltimore Circuit Judge Lawrence P. Fletcher-Hill set the criminal trial for Sept. 22, though State Prosecutor Emmet C. Davitt and defense attorneys said they would seek to have the case specially set before a single judge because of the number of pre-trial motions they anticipate.

So we headed to the Lakes Basin (minus our chains despite the previous day's blizzard). Even this early the road to Tamarack Lodge & Resort was a bit icy. During the season, a shuttle from the village can take you to Tamarack too, where its cross-country ski center has two or three designated areas for snowshoeing.
For those who followed, Skowron provided a link to the franchise’s great teams in the 1950s and 1960s, a link that was lost today. Skowron, a slugging first baseman on four Yankees championship teams, died of congestive heart failure in Illinois. He was 81.

“We need to get those guys in space, where we’re not handing off and 11 guys are chasing them,” UO coach Chip Kelly said Saturday after the Ducks’ 2 ½-hour practice in full pads. “If we get guys rushing the quarterback and we dump it down, that’s huge. Run after the catch is a big deal for what we do. Jeff Maehl was great at it. Drew Davis was a great guy with the ball after the catch.”
But Winograde isn't doing documentary work here. In photos with titles like "Battle on the Little Bighorn" and "Wagon Train," the shooter pulls way back, framing long horizontal scenes (as wide-screen as 18 inches by 48 inches) that are as much sky as they are land. A viewer can't make out a face, or even the what is going on exactly. The stories become murky, the truth muddled. They don't draw conclusions, but an artist can go a long way by simply raising a few questions about what really happened.
The former Marine and semi-retired business executive would go to the refrigerator and forget why he was there. He couldn’t go to the grocery store without a list. He needed people to repeat phone numbers or email addresses. He’d try to knock out an email, but some of the words didn’t come to him. He forgot names of neighbors and even the name of a grandchild.
The house in the Kensington Farm development looked peaceful Tuesday. The only sign that anything had gone awry was the half-mowed backyard.
A classified U.S. intelligence report based on interviews with captured Taliban insurgents concluded in January that the Taliban is biding its time until the U.S. and its allies withdraw. The report was leaked to the media last month.

TORONTO -- The group that operates the Toronto Stock Exchange killed a proposed $3.8 billion merger with the London Stock Exchange Group, saying the controversial deal could not garner enough shareholder support to go ahead.
THE FACTS: That's correct, as far as it goes. But neither can the plan guarantee that people can keep their current coverage. Employers sponsor coverage for most families, and they'd be free to change their health plans in ways that workers may not like, or drop insurance altogether. The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the health care bill written by House Democrats and said that by 2016 some 3 million people who now have employer-based care would lose it because their employers would decide to stop offering it.
The group helped with search efforts at the Hotel Montana, where Ratterman had been staying before the quake hit.
In that category, "Peter" will compete against another Playhouse-launched show: "Bonnie & Clyde." That musical, which likewise launched in La Jolla in 2009, had high-profile beginnings and a high-powered creative team, but closed early on Broadway.

SOMERSET COUNTY — Two drug busts on Route 22 last week yielded six arrests, the seizure of a handgun and more than $9,000 in drugs, Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano said.
If Trayvon Martin were not dead, he could weigh in on this issue. But, of course, the 17-year-old black kid was gunned down while on his way home by a neighborhood watch volunteer who now claims he was only standing his ground when Trayvon punched him. Besides inspiring nationwide protests, the Trayvon Martin case has caused a few Florida lawmakers to wonder if, perhaps, the law needs a little tweaking.

A: It depends on what you signed. If the form said you accepted responsibility for the scratch, then you're responsible for it. But the manager's assurance that it could be "buffed out" and his promise to call you if a claim were necessary, left you with the impression that the form was nothing more than a formality.

Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me") was the biggest name at the year's festival--or at least the biggest one that I can tell you about. (A certain multitasking celebrity touched down briefly in Columbia to promote a new movie about a conceptual art project, but reporters were sworn to secrecy.)

Bush's two nominees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito.
But Ashley Kissinger, an attorney representing the Register in a friend-of-the-court capacity, urged the release of the grand-jury transcript, arguing the public has a presumptive right of access to judicial proceedings, especially in a criminal case with such significant public interest where the D.A.'s Office is seeking the death penalty.

Quiches are excellent ($6 per slice, with side salad) and made a great dinner once I drove home and the sugar high subsided. Goat cheese and dill has just the right mixture of cheese and cream, and fresh salmon and tomato is a hit. There's also Lorraine and spinach/ricotta turnovers.
As a potluck dish, the authors suggest assigning it to the hostess, so it can be popped in the oven just before guests start to arrive. As a toted dish, the recommendation is to bake it right before leaving, then immediately cover it with foil so it doesn't lose heat and carry it in an insulated food carrier to the meal. Reheated, it is a marvelous midnight snack, too.

The delays come in part because of Portland harbor's complicated history. The Lower Duwamish is dominated by Boeing, a longtime owner with clear responsibility for contamination.

At home, the Kings are shooting 44.6 percent and averaging 102.1 points, but those numbers fall to 41.6 percent and 94.7 points on the road.

At this point, what I've said is, is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have. And I think — and I think that's the right thing to do. But I recognize that from their perspective it is not enough, and I think is something that we're going to continue to debate and I personally am going to continue to wrestle with going forward." — News conference, Dec. 22, 2010

I lived for a time in the Wallingford neighborhood just up the street from Gas Works Park, a grassy mound on Lake Union with a spectacular view of downtown. My downstairs neighbor played drums in a rock band and practiced six and seven hours a day. So there were times when a quiet hike up the hill to watch the boats pass by was necessary for sanity.

Mitt Romney, the Republican front-runner, might be easier to elect than to nominate. The reverse might be true of Perry. Is he a wine that will not travel? To win the White House, a Republican must be competitive among independents, including women, in places like Montgomery County outside Philadelphia. Perry — his accent, his Westerner’s body language, those boots — is proof that, in spite of the culture’s homogenizing forces, regional differences remain remarkably durable. But so, too, do regional antipathies, some of which have intensified as voters have become more polarized, partly because of a Texas governor who became president.

Democratic mapmakers tweaked the boundaries of the famously independent-minded 10th District in hopes of unseating freshman Republican Rep. Robert Dold. The result is a four-way Democratic primary featuring two candidates who sound like they're running in the bright blue 9th. Ilya Sheyman, 25, of Waukegan, is a community organizer barely old enough to serve in Congress. His supporters include the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, MoveOn.org and former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean. Asked to name an issue on which he disagreed with the Obama administration, Sheyman noted that he continued to fight for the so-called "public option" after it had been dropped from the president's health care reform plan. Yes, he bravely took a stand to the left of Obama. Attorney Vivek Bavda, 34, of Mundelein is sharp and has a microscopic command of policy details, but again, probably too liberal for the 10th District.

I now adore the intersection of Manhattan modernism with tropical Hawaii.

JAKE2: The eye of an artist!
"He challenged me. He knew what a grand dream that was, and that it was going to take a lot of work. Obviously, he had been around a lot of people who ultimately became Hall of Famers — Merlin Olsen, Tom Mack, people like that — and he knew the work that these guys had put in. He didn't know anything about me, but he knew that if I was dreaming this way, I'd better be aware of the work that went into becoming that kind of a guy."
COLUMBUS, Ohio - An unemployed Ohio man was browsing at his local thrift store for items he could restore and resell when he spotted a Picasso poster with the word "Exposition" written across the front, some French words, and the image of a warped round face.

The Brotherhood also faces intense criticism over its control of a panel to draft a constitution. Liberals, secularists, Christians and a leading Muslim institution are boycotting the constituent assembly.

A church in Akron refused to sell its 100 shares of Goodyear stock even though it needed $150,000 to buy a new roof. High school students started a stock-buying campaign and wrote letters to Congress and to Merrill Lynch. The Ohio Machine & Mold Co. withdrew $130,000 it had invested with the local Merrill Lynch office, owner John Hagerman wrote, because of "your company's effort to assist Sir James Goldsmith in his attempted takeover of the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.," according to the Beacon Journal.

Those who haven't seen the Monster Ball yet are probably wondering about the clothes Lady Gaga wore. Did she emerge from an egg? Was there any meat on her head? No and no, but she did peer from the windows of a mock subway train with white tape crisscrosses over her nipples. Later, she'd stalk the runway in a steel brassiere shooting out electric sparks. For "The Fame," she wore what only could be described as a red drape, which spilled out over the steps of an onstage staircase decorated with upside-down syringes. Did all of this distract from the music? Well, yes, it did, a little. But Lady Gaga has become so closely identified with wild fashion choices that it would read as a betrayal if she ever showed up onstage in a t-shirt and jeans. (Now, there would be some genuine provocation.)
The overture to black Democrats could mean that GOP lawmakers are willing to alter the map they passed last month to make it easier for a black candidate to be elected in a second congressional district.

"First Position"—This is a welcome antidote to tawdry reality shows like "Dance Moms" and breathless competitions like "So You Think You Can Dance." Director Bess Kargman's documentary follows a half-dozen aspiring professional ballet dancers at the Youth America Grand Prix, a competition for performers ages 9-19 where prizes, scholarships and contracts with prestigious companies await. Structurally similar to the documentaries "Spellbound" (about the National Spelling Bee) and "Waiting for 'Superman'" (about public-school students hoping for chances at a better education), "First Position" reveals the home lives of these youngsters as they prepare and lets us get to know their families, all of whom have made huge sacrifices to foster their children's dreams. They come from varied backgrounds but they're all inspiring in their focus and discipline, as well as their willingness to embrace a childhood that is far from ordinary. Kargman's tasteful, intimate approach features all of the theatricality of the art form with none of the backstage drama; "The Turning Point," this is not. Her film actually may be a little too understated, a little too safe. But Kargman is both a former ballet dancer herself as well as a journalist, so she knows not only what's important but also how to stay out of the way and let the story tell itself in her filmmaking debut. Little girls (and some boys) will love "First Position": It's an ideal film for kids to see with their families. Unrated but contains nothing more offensive than some mangled toenails. 94 minutes. Three stars out of four.
