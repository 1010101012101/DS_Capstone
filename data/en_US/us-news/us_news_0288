He won't be recognized. "Some people might come up and say, ‘You look like that action guy,' but obviously it's not him. That's because I dress so scruffy. I've actually heard, ‘You can't be that Jason Statham guy because he has much more money than you. You dress like a slob.' "

Or, in otherwise unremarkable droplets of Prieto's language -- "as you like it," "body electric," "the catastrophe of an overcoat" -- is the author coding in lexical memes of Shakespeare, Whitman, Gogol, Kafka, Dostoevski, Nabokov and others to create a playful, grand literary trompe l'oeil?

Asked what he'd wear on gameday, Fickell said whatever his wife, Amy, puts out for him. He did say he expects to wear black so that the players on the field can easily see him stand out on the sideline when signaling in plays.

It is time for the United States to mandate a strict nationwide vaccine policy, with stringent guidelines to obtain religious exemptions and no room for philosophical exemptions. The recommended vaccination schedule issued annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is no longer sufficient. Although parental autonomy should be respected in many situations, vaccine-preventable illnesses are a public health issue, and parents do not have the right to gamble with their children's lives. Furthermore, they do not have the right to gamble with the lives of other children who may be infected by a child whose parents chose not to vaccinate.
Republican leaders' hints Thursday that stadium votes might not be coming if Gov. Mark Dayton vetoed an unrelated bill that cuts business taxes -- as he did Friday -- were also unfortunate.

Offering more for the same price is one way to boost sales since consumers are so focused on saving money right now, said Christopher Shanahan, a research analyst with Frost & Sullivan.

It's ironic that so much attention is now being focused on the impact of Gingrich's attack ads, which seem to have left the unlikely Santorum as the latest beneficiary of Republican anti-Romney sentiments. In Iowa, Gingrich was leading in the polls until his rivals began hitting him with one attack after another. He chose not to respond, taking voters at their word that they wanted a positive campaign. That was a rookie error, particularly striking for a veteran politician who had made his way to the top of the GOP leader board with his razor-sharp debate responses, and who had spent a career as a professional gadfly, never shy to take a shot at anyone, even Ronald Reagan.

There is an important point to be made about the choice to employ a forbidden act for a righteous cause. This exemption from a moral demand cannot be taken as a license to use forbidden acts for any other purpose than the removal of a greater evil. There can be no doubt that the advent of Nazi fascism, with its strident racism, expansionist nationalism and perfected capacity for torture was a blight on the civilized world. They could never have been subdued without extreme retaliation.

SB1070, signed by Gov. Brewer in 2010, requires all immigrants in Arizona to obtain or carry immigration registration papers and requires police, while enforcing other laws, to question people's immigration status if there is a reasonable suspicion they're in the country illegally.

I would consider trading a third for McCoy. I'd prefer to get a starter at some position with that third round pick, but given the importance of the quarterback position, it would be worth looking into, especially if the board isn't very enticing when the Bears' turn comes up. The Bears would have to investigate if McCoy would be on board with being Cutler's backup, but he's a talented player with potential. The jury is out on whether or not McCoy can be a solid starter, but he has shown enough to make me believe he would be a very good backup.

Heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat. Add the mushrooms and toss to coat with the fat. Cook, stirring almost constantly, until the mushrooms begin to brown, then lower the heat to moderately low and cook until the mushrooms are tender, 10-12 minutes for porcini. If the mushrooms threaten to cook dry before they are done, add a tablespoon or two of water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the shallots and cook, stirring for about 2 minutes to soften them. Add the parsley, stir well and remove from the heat.
He shares a litany of negative experiences with others in the ranks of the unemployed. Batten terms those experiences "head winds." And he has run into just nearly every one: Spooked companies pulling promising jobs off the table in the middle of the interviewing process.

Firms that won't hire a candidate who is not currently employed.

And the Freedom of Information Act? Even when an ordinance allows for its use, the Emanuel administration has been masterful at denying press inquiries by invoking an exemption to block release of documents detailing the "deliberative process" of their decision-making.

Judy Greer: The girl from Livonia who grew up to be the most dependable supporting actress around is following her moving turn in "The Descendants" with another solid performance in the richly realistic comedy "Jeff Who Lives at Home." She plays the wife of a clueless husband (Ed Helms).

Performed the same night as her other strongest vocal of the season, this Adele started with an a cappella chorus that showed off both the power we already knew had and more soul than she'd shown all season. Then, the band kicked in and it was even better, both in terms of singing and her overall performance, actually shrugging her shoulders to underscore the lyrical shrug of "Go ahead and sell me out."
And the second big step is Holland becoming aggressive in free agency. Datsyuk and Zetterberg are the stars. But the other players have whiffed on the chance to be the secondary stars on this team. Conventional wisdom focuses on the Preds Ryan Suter to bolster the defense and the Devils Zach Parise to add scoring punch to the offense. But the problem with conventional wisdom is that it often times doesnt come to pass. There will be a lot of other teams in on Suter and Parise and the Red Wings natural allure to free agents isnt nearly as strong as it used to be.

"She is very gender ambiguous in this piece," Giles says, "and in the end that's where I wanted to return. Is the faun male, female or asexual?

Why can't the Legislature, which wants so badly to give tax relief to business, take the money from expiring tax credits and give it directly to those businesses in the form of rebates for personal property taxes paid? That way, businesses get the tax relief, local governments aren't pushed any closer to bankruptcy, and state legislators are heroes.

The winner last year was Charl Schwartzel of South Africa. Nice guy who put on a great performance, but most people couldn't pick him out of a lineup of heavily logo-ed golfers.

New Year's Eve celebrations in Monterey aren't limited to the 21-and-older crowd. The Monterey Bay Aquarium hosts a sleepover on Dec. 31 for adults and children 5 and older. The event offers a great opportunity to explore the aquarium without the usual crowds. Sleepover guests are promised some peeks behind the scenes, and there's a nature film screening for night owls in the group.
But the eight-member cast and musical director Ryan Brewster bring sardonic lightness to a tongue-in-cheek medley of pop anthems exploiting the exotic other — from "Walk Like an Egyptian" to "Turning Japanese" to "Kung Fu Fighting." Brenda Didier's high-spirited choreography makes the most of the small proscenium space, and if you grab a seat at one of the front-row tables, you're likely to be on the receiving end of extra attention from the performers.

One law enforcement source told the newspaper that the Justice Department's Office of International Affairs has not asked the Mexican government to turn over Valdez-Calixto because Justice officials are not confident that the case meets the Mexican legal standards of proof required for extradition.

2. Get on the good foot: Don't worry if you've never mastered Dance Dance Revolution. The bon dance steps are relatively simple, and repeated long enough that anyone should feel free to give it a go. The stylized hand motions often reflect specific actions but can easily be mimicked, even if you don't know, for example, that "Tanko Bushi" is the "Coal Miners' Song," with gestures inspired by digging, lantern hanging and brow wiping. Some dances involve waving a tenugui, which looks like a soccer scarf but is really a cotton towel; you can just wave your hands if you don't have one (they're often given away in raffles during the festivals). The more experienced dancers — often in the uniform kimono of their bon odori dance club — are generally closest to the yagura, so feel free to watch them until they've circled a few times before joining in, if you're unsure. And if you want a sneak peek of the dance moves, check out this video of bon dancing, one of many available online. It was shot at Oahu's Hawaii Okinawa Center, which sponsors this weekend's Okinawan Festival in Waikiki's Kapiolani Park and the indoor Autumn Matsuri (festival) at the center on Sept. 20; you'll notice the video also includes a few bon dances set to modern pop songs.

She takes a creative leap with the strawberry "ravioli" ($9), turning the fruit into al dente leather packets with a thin filling of honey-thyme cream.

He fretted about his public image and the legacy of his organization. He wondered whether he had misnamed it Al-Qaida. He fired off orders, handed out promotions, denied requests for help from the battlefield and sought to direct publicity for the looming 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. And he schemed to kill the man who would, in the end, give the order to shoot him dead: President Obama.

Is the Dan Rodricks who wrote that ridiculously misinformed column about pit bulls ("Pit bulls: Own them at your risk," May 1) the same Dan Rodricks who implores us to give ex-cons a second chance in society? He's ready to condemn innocent dogs and their owners, but we are all supposed to give people who have already been proven guilty of a crime a second chance? What about a first chance for pit bulls, Dan?
The period piece unfolds in a rather posh Dublin hotel with plenty of upstairs-downstairs antics, a dose of typhoid fever, a range of assignations and all the personalities that would suggest. But above all else, "Albert Nobbs" is a character study. And between fear of intimacy and fear of poverty, Nobbs is so emotionally stunted by the very act of living as to almost cease to exist.

Knee and hip replacements have been common for decades, offering patients who suffered from degeneration a full range of pain-free movement. But spines and backs have been more problematic. Spinal fusions, the gold standard, have meant a limited range of motion for patients and even future procedures on adjoining discs. But a newer procedure that involves inserting an artificial disc, called total disc replacement, means patients can get that range of motion and pain relief without the drawbacks of fusion. Once other therapies have been exhausted, Dr. Amiel Bethel, a neurosurgeon at Baltimore Washington Medical Center, performs the procedure through a small incision, minimizing tissue disruption.

Anyone who comes to the film expecting a stock nice-guy performance from Krasinski similar to his work on TV's "The Office" may be in for a shock. Going through something of an early midlife crisis, his character puts his stable life at risk for reasons that remain a mystery even to himself.

In the city system, participating candidates have to live within certain spending and contribution limits. In a new statewide system, there are likely to be no spending restrictions but lower limits on contributions.

In fact, it works the other way: a government as big and bossy as this one is maintained on the backs of the middle class, and those who hope to join it.

This year's show turned back the clock again and that's why I go. I usually go alone, too, because my own adult kids long ago reached the threshold of appreciation for the memories that I can unearth on every corner. That's probably normal, but I like my semiannual nostalgia trip.

Nothing during that period, however, came close to the adulation Robinson received when he attended the weekly boxing cards at the old Olympic Auditorium. There always was something thrilling about the way Jimmy Lennon -- the incomparable announcer of so many memorable fights -- would save Sugar Ray for last during the traditional introduction of dignitaries that preceded each card: "And now," that faultless Irish tenor would intone, "I am calling to the ring, the former world welterweight champion, the five-time middleweight champion, pound for pound the greatest fighter in the history of the world, the champion's champion -- Sugar Raaaay Robinsooooooooon!"

Whoever the geniuses may be behind these coordinated political attacks, they need to get a little more creative. When everyone from a first-term Kansas congressman to a Fox TV talking head to Rush Limbaugh employs the same sound bite, it is not hard to guess they are reciting from the same Republican National Committee talking points. Perhaps, such repetition pumps up the conservative faithful, but it looks pretty ridiculous when Jon Stewart pulls together a string of video clips showing the entire Republican sales team squawking away like a flock of parrots.

Somehow, Indiana managed to slow VCU (29-7), which established its pace in the first half; the Rams led, 42-41, at the break. Neither team could miss -- the Hoosiers made 67 percent of their shots, yet were behind. That changed in the second half, though. VCU managed just 19 points in the final 20 minutes, shooting 25 percent from the field (7 of 28), three-point range (4 of 16), and the free throw line (1 of 4).

* The bailout would reward speculators. Some people saw the housing bubble as an opportunity to make quick profits by buying and selling homes. There is nothing wrong with such speculation -- assuming that the people seeking quick profits (or those financing the speculators) also are willing to accept quick losses. McCain's bailout would socialize the costs of bad speculation. This is morally offensive, but also economically foolish because it would encourage imprudent levels of speculation in the future.

A survey this week by pollster GPO shows that the two parties together would command just 32.4% of the vote, and that six other parties would also be represented in Parliament. New Democracy would command only 18.2% of the vote and despite a 50-seat bonus awarded to the leading party under Greece's election law, it wouldn't have an absolute majority.

When the question has been put to the voters -- more than 30 times in state referendums since 1988 -- they have come down against gay marriage every time.

"One of the most troubling aspects of the President's budget is his own prediction of higher unemployment in the next two years under his policies," said Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Rob Portman. "The President's budget predicts unemployment rates of 8.9 percent in 2012 and 8.6 percent in 2013.

Hey, Tony: Don't you think the play of the Buffalo Bills should give some of the negative Cleveland fans hope? They've gone from third worse last year to 4-1 so far this year. Both have similar quarterbacks -- small, smart with average arms. The Browns also have extra first- and fourth-round picks. The Eagles' woes after signing all those high-priced free agents also indicates the Browns are going about trying to build a winner the right way. Also, I'm not sure I understand the thought that Peyton Hillis' value to the team has diminished because of the West Coast offense. He catches the ball well and a big power back with good speed is not easily found. I think he's the face of the team right now, a real blue collar player. Lastly, can the Browns put a franchise tag on him if they couldn't sign him? -- Paul Naudain, Portland, Ore.

During the winter months, when the angle of the sun is lower, the shades let in maximum sunlight for a solar-heat gain.

That leaves Obama in the middle, which could turn out to be a good spot. The president can't do much to make the economy recover more quickly, and he hasn't found a way to make his health care law more popular, but he still has the powers of his office in foreign policy.

"Tootsie" (1982): Dustin Hoffman is outstanding as a would-be actor who dresses as a woman to win a role in a soap opera, then can't break character because the woman he plays becomes a big hit. Jessica Lange won an Oscar, and Bill Murray is a scream. Great movie.

Daniel Craig stars as a loving husband and father of two girls who relocates his family to a beautiful home in a small New England town, only to suspect that all is not as it seems. Rachel Weisz, Craig's real-life wife, also plays his movie wife here, giving the film some extra naturalism. Naomi Watts plays their new neighbor, who also notices strange happenings and tries to help. This reality-bending 2011 psychological puzzle relies on a key plot development that some may find too predictable. The film cost $55 million and made only $21 million in U.S. theaters.

The other draw at AKR is the dolphin research center. Part of the camp includes interacting with dolphins. As someone who won't set foot in a zoo, I admit I was conflicted about this part of the experience. But the Roatan Institute for Marine Science at Anthony's Key ensures that all dolphins are obtained humanely. Marine biologists and scientists from all over the world come here to study dolphin intelligence and health, and NOVA filmed a dolphin television special at AKR recently.

Years have passed since I had to face those decisions, the hardest I've ever made and not a day goes by that I don't miss those who have gone before me. The consolation is, there is no more suffering and as you said so accurately, no more tubes, beeping, hisses, needles, tests, decisions and yes, finally peace, knowing their time had come to an end and we did the best we could to help them fight, but let them go with love.

• As Fred Kerber of the Post explained, Dwyane Wade had a strong Game 2 because he knew he wouldn't face the same attention as teammate LeBron James: "The Knicks went into Game 2 of the Eastern Conference first round series against the Heat last night without their superb, athletic rookie defender, Iman Shumpert. Now everyone figured Dwyane Wade, whom Shumpert would have drawn as a defensive assignment, would have been ultra-aggressive at the outset... Wade was. But he chuckled at the notion he did so because he didn’t see Shumpert aligned against him. He did so, Wade explained, because he figured the guys in orange and blue would be trying to figure a way to snuff LeBron James, who was a one-man demolition team Saturday."

Politicians of both parties have furthered the misunderstanding by frequently drawing an analogy between the federal budget and household budgets. "Families across this country understand what it takes to manage a budget," President Obama declared in a February radio broadcast. "Well, it's time Washington acted as responsibly as our families do." While this comparison appeals to a general belief that we should "live within our means," it's also misleading.

"I really like this one," said Wine Director Julian Demiri of the creation. "You can just drink it all day long." And not just because of the pleasing flavor, either. The relatively low alcohol content of the ingredients puts this martini at just over the level of a glass of wine, so you could probably enjoy a few of them at Scupper's $5 happy hour and, while you're at it, watch the boats go by thanks to the spectacular views of the Inner Harbor.
