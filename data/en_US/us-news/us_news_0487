In the area from the foul line to the no-charge arc, betwixt the daintiness of pull-up jumpers and the clatter and clash of driving layups, Jamison thrives. Cavs coach Mike Brown variously called it Thursday the area from 15 to 13 feet away, or from 10 to 12 feet from the rim, but he could have called it the land of the lost. The popularity of the 3-point shot made the intermediate jumper a lost art, but few players even practice shots in Jamison's 'tweener land.

When a group inside Onstar made a presentation about plans to convert to a 3G system, from 2G, Mr. Girsky snapped: "Why are we talking about 3G when everyone else is on 4G?", cutting short the presentation, people who attended the meeting recall. Shortly thereafter, he replaced OnStar's president with an executive from the telecommunications industry. In the end, though, Mr. Girsky conceded it wasn't possible to convert to a 4G system as quickly as he had wanted.

Elections for the mayor of London and local authorities around the country will provide a broader gauge of where the parties stand.

Chris Darker, business manager for Redding-based United Public Employees of California, Local 792 that represents the affected Milpitas employees, urged the council to undo the layoff plan.
It's easy to understand the appeal of certain regulation. If we'd had the right oversight in place, we would have limited the degree of the financial crisis, which included bailouts measured in hundreds of billions of dollars and millions of people losing their homes due to foreclosures. But we also would have sacrificed innovations in credit and a vibrant financial sector.

That was what got acorn woodpeckers in trouble in Rossmoor, a retirement community in Walnut Creek. New units built in the 1990s near existing live oaks had stucco-covered Styrofoam for trim - unfortunately much easier to drill into than a living tree. The noise disturbed residents, and the houses appeared to have been machine-gunned. Twenty of the birds were shot in 2008 under a federal depredation permit; another 20 were captured and taken to a Colorado research center the following year. The woodpeckers quickly became a cause celebre. At the behest of Mount Diablo Audubon, Rossmoor built six artificial granaries to divert the birds.

statistical coin flip. The unavoidable conclusion is that he was not wrong to punt, that it was just as valid a strategy as going for it on fourth-and-15. Surprise.

"It's not only for its own sake, my own curiosity and my desire to do deep ocean exploration and photograph it and bring it back in 3D for people who aren't so fortunate as to be able to jump into a sub; I think the greater goal is to create new materials, new engineering, new technology the science community can use at a time when governments and major institutions are either cash-strapped or lack the will to do this kind of exploration that intrigues the public, especially kids. I don't think kids want to think exploration is a thing of the past. To be here exploring literally the last frontier for exploration on planet Earth, all the deep trenches -- there's still an awful lot that remains unexplored here in the 21st century.

Hillis turned upfield at the 30. He kept moving right as he moved forward to avoid safety Chris Crocker, who had the angle. They finally met at the 45. Crocker wanted to ride Hillis out of the bounds to stop the clock, and appeared to be in prime position to do so. At the Cincinnati 49, it was a done deal. Hillis was going to get the first down, and more, but the clock was going to stop.

S., Mpls., 612-605-7999, www.naturalbuilt home.com) is worth a visit.

Sale items include Marmoleum linoleum, bamboo flooring, tile from recycled glass or porcelain, countertop remnants, sinks, nontoxic paints (mistints) and kitchen cabinets. Most items are in small quantities, which works well for small projects. Two-foot-long countertops can work as end tables or shelves, while small amounts of tile can be used for backsplashes, accent pieces or tabletops.

Although behind-the-scenes negotiations continue in Columbus over the date of the primary and the boundaries of a new congressional map, all indications are that Fudge and Turner would compete in a barbell-shaped district that would extend from much of Cleveland and eastern Cuyahoga County into Summit County and a sizable chunk of Akron.

Santo emerged from baseball purgatory last week. His numbers hadn't changed since 1974, but thanks to the rise of the stats geeks immortalized in Michael Lewis' "Moneyball," they had taken on new luster. Santo, it turns out, was an on-base machine (.362) when Billy Beane was still in Little League. Bill James rates him the sixth-best third baseman ever. None of that factors in health: Santo played with diabetes he hid from the public. He self-medicated with candy bars between innings.

In Israel, I heard an equal degree of outrage.

President Barack Obama's administration and China's officials have signaled that the global economy, North Korea, Iran and Sudan — issues in which millions of lives are at stake — have become far more important in U.S.-Chinese relations.

The goal of Propositions A and C and Measure R, which raised the sales tax, was to build a rail system, but not necessarily to maintain and operate one.

There's 36.4 inches of legroom for the rear passengers, slightly more than other cars in this class - like the Mercedes-Benz GLK - offer. While the backseat splits into thirds and folds flat with the press of a button, expanding the cargo area to 67.4 cubic feet, its backrests don't recline, a big oversight on Volvo's part. More and more child-safety seat manufacturers allow the installation of forward-facing seats in a slightly reclined position for added comfort. My youngest daughters still nap in their booster seats, so I prefer to keep the seatback reclined just enough so that they stay upright, rather than slumping forward over the top of their seat belts.

In the 1920s, a group of Baltimore citizens rallied to save the Phoenix Shot Tower from being demolished to make way for a gas station. At that time, the structure was privately owned, and in one of Baltimore's earliest historic preservation efforts, the group raised more than $20,000, bought the tower and then donated it to the city. Nearly 100 years ago, these people had the foresight and determination to give us a great gift that has become a Baltimore icon. Today, we are the stewards of the Shot Tower and many other great historic places. We now have the chance, and the obligation, to employ the same creativity and determination to make sure these places remain for future Baltimoreans to enjoy.

Martin's saga of Westeros was even called "unadaptable" until David Benioff and D.B. Weiss came along. The producers of "Game of Thrones," they managed with the rest of the HBO crew to find a way to adapt the story for television that's at least satisfactory to some Martin fans. Times writer Geoff Boucher, on our sister blog, Hero Complex, talked to Benioff and Weiss last year about the challenges of adapting this mammoth epic (despite sounding redundant, in Martin's case adding "mammoth" to "epic" seems justifiable) for HBO.

Although the papers have given you many details I will briefly recite my own experiences on the morning of Wednesday (after "Carmen" in the Grand Operahouse -- a late supper at Zinkand's where I met George Lask and others -- and a bedgoing at 2 a.m.). I was rudely awakened from a most profound and peaceful sleep, by a sudden jerk or shock that seemed to lift me with the whole building to an indefinite height. Then it settled back vertically in the same rude and impolite precipitate manner. But this was not all.

I also enjoy a light breakfast of milk-laced coffee and toast with a little jam. I've been making bread by hand with formulas that yield three to four loaves. Consequently, every couple of weeks, I'm awash in bread, even after sharing a loaf with my Chronicle colleagues and giving some to friends.
"The Pursuit of Happyness" goes beyond tugging at our heartstrings. It plucks them, strokes them, strums them, plays them for all they're worth.

øIt helped coming to a team that had Angel McCoughtry. Obviously, she's an enormously talented player, one of the best we have in the WNBA. But, she's also someone I've played with and known for a while, dating back to our experiences with USA Basketball.

Fortunately for Joyce, her healthcare nightmare is ending. She has just turned 65 and will now be eligible for Medicare. Soon she will be able to get the basic tests and medications that she needs after years of devoting herself to the impoverished in Africa.

Hey, Joshua: Did you watch Flacco outplay Ben Roethlisberger in the Ravens' win in Pittsburgh on Sunday night? Flacco has won playoff games on the road. Don't look at his stats.

Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO now running for the U.S. Senate from California, describes in her memoir, "Tough Choices," how she was disinvited to an important lunch back in the early 1980s when it turned out the clients wanted to go to a strip club. "I had no idea what I was supposed to do in this situation," she writes. "I couldn't tell myself it didn't matter -- it clearly was important to meet these clients and to convince (her boss) that I should be taken seriously. It never occurred to me to be outraged and demand that they not go -- it wouldn't have worked anyway."
When the Ravens intimidated Denver in the wild-card round, I didn't think they could be stopped. But they nearly were the following week in Nashville.

"They're on the same schedule as us..." Kelly said. "No one's at a disadvantage or advantage."
It clearly takes two to tandem: the captain (up front) and the stoker (in back). These positions are strictly determined by weight and size. The bigger, heavier person with greater upper body strength sits in front to steer and stabilize the bike. This means that -- most often, but not always -- the guy ends up as captain and the gal as stoker, who provides pedaling and sometimes navigation. This might seem ripe for relationship road rash, as the stoker dreads a loss of control without being able to steer and the captain becomes irritated with suggestions from the "rear admiral." But many say that's far from reality.
Justifiably outraged, Common Cause went to the trouble of producing a credible redistricting plan. The group

Sets by Anthony Ward added style to the opera’s potentially dull locales with a pixelated projection of the diva’s face, a big Sphinx on which Mattila lounged and a backdrop of multilingual scribblings, a nod to Marty’s love letters and the paper on which she rediscovers her father’s formula for longevity. Costumes by Dona Granata were glamorous enough and flattering.

"Last year was the biggest downturn in the U.S. lodging industry since we've been monitoring rates and occupancy, which we began doing in 1935," Baltin said. He blamed not just the recession but also the " AIG effect," referring to public outrage when the insurance giant held a conference at a lavish resort in 2008 after a government bailout. For months, publicity-shy companies canceled off-site meetings.
Another aspect of the full restoration involves tree clearing. Because the August 2011 storm left its scars and marks on the landscape of the park, there are a number of downed, leaning and compromised trees along the Raceway. Removing certain trees will be part of what’s necessary in getting things back to where they need to be and a clearing plan has been submitted to FEMA for review and approval. This process is under way and we are awaiting a response from FEMA on the trees as well.
FitzGerald threatened to veto add-ons he opposed, arguing that the county should keep its reserves on hand, to protect against falling revenues in the future and to achieve a better credit rating, which would lower interest charges on county bonds.
Lang has been an energizing and polarizing figure in classical music since he substituted at the last minute for Andre Watts in 1999 at the Ravinia Festival, playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Chicago Symphony. He has been both praised for his technique and reproached for his interpretive excesses, but he's the kind of artist who manages to obviate criticism: Like him or not, he's a phenomenon, and he can sell out a concert hall in no time flat.
"We went through so much," Davis said. "Every night we prayed that they wouldn't take our house. It was all we had."

Lawmakers began on Wednesday debating fixes to the formula - a calculation approved in 2005 to provide adequate funds to all students by next year.

It's not up to date but they've got the numbers coming in, they're applying them to the appropriate accounts.

What do you think of the Tigers' chances this year? Well, obviously, you have the return of Justin Verlander and a new Prince of the city and, overall, some good bats and a deep bullpen. But for me, it's more than that. I think it's the skipper and the culture he has developed. Jim Leyland carries with him a love for the game, a love for his players and a love for the fans and the city of Detroit. Honestly, this love is palpable when you watch him go out and give his pitcher a hug at the end of the game, when he steps out of the dugout to defend a player and certainly when he answers questions by the media. The bottom line is, he has created a culture where his players will do anything for him and he wants to win the World Series for the city of Detroit.

The tag guarantees such a player either a salary in the top five of the other NFL players at his position or 120 percent of the player's previous year's salary, whichever is greater. If the tag is not renewed, the player becomes an unfettered free agent after the next season, with his market value determined, in a Darwinian exercise, by what he has done lately.

Days 22-25: The four-pack was enormously difficult because I helped cover the Mid-American Conference basketball tournament at The Q. Don't get me wrong: I love the MAC tournament.
