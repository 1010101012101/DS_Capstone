That's where policies come in, as opposed to biographies. As far as "ordinary middle-class people" are concerned, the most salient facts about Romney are his economic plan, his desire to cut taxes, his pledge to stop the 2010 healthcare reform law from going into effect, his support for overhauling Medicare and raising the retirement age -- in other words, the things he says he would do in the Oval Office that would have a real effect on their lives. If those policies were merely an outgrowth of Romney's wealth, there would be no difference politically between him and George Soros or Warren Buffett.

This is one injury I have some personal experience with. I ruptured my right Achilles tendon in a pickup basketball game a couple of years ago. It wasn't a particularly painful injury, but a full rupture removes all of the support from the back of the ankle, making it impossible to bear any weight or push off with that foot. It took about four months of intense rehab after reconstructive surgery to return to normal activity, and I'm talking about the normal activity of a sportswriter, which basically entails walking, watching sporting events and eating chicken wings.

"I-70 split the neighborhood. It devalued property. It created this imposition on people's lives, on the citizens of the city who have to deal with noise, with the air particulates, etc. At this point, it's a simple question: "Why should these folks be asked to sacrifice their quality of life, their property values when we know there are other ways to deal with these things? It's not fantasy. It's not theoretical. Freeways have been removed in cities and things got better. Neighborhoods were reunited, property conditions and value improved, more development occurred, streets became walkable again, and traffic found its way — often times more efficiently than was possible when the limited access freeway existed.

After the riots, L.A.'s insularity somehow fostered restaurants with a strength of purpose, even stronger and more specific than they had previously been. Mainstream restaurants began to find their inspiration within L.A.'s communities rather than outside them. You began to see chefs congregating at places like Guelaguetza and Sapp on their days off, and the standard Los Angeles style of service grew to become more like the shared-plates meals at local Japanese izakaya, or Thai coffee shops, or Korean pubs, or Mexican botana bars — almost as a sign of L.A. cultural literacy, but perhaps something more.

What do you do when you have more fresh milk than you can sell? Make darn good cheese with the rest. Of course, it�s a bonus if you have a cheesemaking room so city folk (aka agritourists) can watch after they get bored petting the cute calves over in the barn. Shatto�s milk � sold in glass bottles and available in an ever-expanding rainbow of colors and flavors � has become iconic, even though the company has been leaving milk mustaches only since 2003. The chocolate milk was ranked among the top three in the world at a recent dairy expo. But that doesn�t mean owner Leroy Shatto is resting on his laurels. Shatto and cheesemaker Gary Campbell also are gaining recognition from cheese connoisseurs for their aged cheeses, such as Shatto�s Parrano (part gouda/part Parmesan), which placed 16th out of 58 in the 2010 World Championship Cheese Competition. Not bad for guys who have been making cheese for less than a year. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make 1 pound of cheese. This spring, Shatto opened a window into the cheesemaking process with a room that allows visitors to the farm to watch the handling of the curds and whey. Shatto estimates 160 to 200 people make the trip to his farm in Osborn, Mo., on any given day.

b. Background: We recently agreed to help the city by ramping up our contributions to OPEB. This deal was before a 12% pay cut, and massive reductions in staff. It was also before the prospects of another 16% pay cut. Our members were under the impression that it would likely increase to about 7-8% of pay (close to what accruals cost). Since payroll was cut so deeply, it now looks as though it'll be 15.5% of pay.

Emphatically, no. Gannett, a media and marketing solutions company, operates more than 80 newspapers and 23 television stations in the United States along with USA Today and related digital delivery systems. Throughout the company's history it has strongly emphasized that editorial decisions should be the responsibility of local publishers and editors. Some Gannett newspapers have a decidedly right-of-center slant in their editorials (the unsigned comments on the opinion pages that represent a paper's editorial board); others are left of center. Still others are somewhere in between.

As for the Montero-Pineda situation, even though there were red flags with Pineda - his subpar second half last year (5.12 ERA), his "violent delivery" as scouts described it - Cashman had every good reason to make the deal.

When I married five years ago, I was on the fence about having kids. I thought some parental gene might kick in, but it never did. Now, at 40, I’ve accepted that a childless marriage is best for us, given my wife’s fertility issues and my ambivalence about parenthood. My wife, however, sees no purpose to life without children. It upsets her to see me happy without kids while she pines for them. She is also upset that I won't try all possible alternatives, such as adoption and fertility treatments, and is generally angry and outright hostile toward me.

Instead, the woman pulled a watermelon from under her blouse. "People have attachments to things from their countries," says Krekorian.
Could be a national park: Monument Valley. The red-hued monoliths are a great symbol of the West. The background for many John Ford films, the area straddling Utah and Arizona is part of the Navajo reservation. Its sovereign status means it will never be a national park. If it were, it would be one of my favorites.

At least one of the Dutch study's findings raises more questions than it answers. The researchers found no increase in ovarian cancer rates when a woman had several cycles of IVF: Whether she had undergone one cycle or five in an effort to conceive a baby, the increase in ovarian cancer risk was the same. That absence of a "dose response relationship," in addition to the finding that, overall, invasive ovarian cancer rates did not rise with IVF, mean there's likely to be more research--and more twists and turns--to this line of research.
Currie should know. Last year, his recording of the piece helped Higdon win a Grammy for best classical contemporary composition.

It already was difficult for the Red Bulls even with MLS' leading scorer, who now has nine goals in eight games and whose intimidating presence creates so much space for his teammates.

After trailing for much of the night, Romney forged ahead in a count that stretched past midnight. With votes tallied in 99 percent of the state's precincts, he led by about 12,000 out of more than 1.1 million cast.

But could Lionsgate have saved a heck of a lot of money by casting "Real Housewife of New Jersey" Teresa Giudice in the role? Certainly she could use the work.

DiIorio is extraordinarily skillful in the way he raises the stakes from one scene to the next. Each one provides a new complication that seems impossible to solve.

I can only hazard a guess that Romney, far from being so comfortable with his wealth that he has lost any real sense of how others live, is in fact discomfited by it and has an irresistible impulse to talk it down.

Letter writing is a lost art. There have been many songs and movies written about letters. For instance, "Love Letters" and "Letters Edged in Black" are the songs I remember and the movie, "The Postman Rings Twice."

Yehoshua's numbers are very far off. In fact, some 45 percent of American Jews have been to Israel, about half of them twice or more, most of these three times or more. What Yehoshua means when he says we are "partial, it is that he and his compatriots are "complete" because (1) they hold Israeli citizenship, (2) they are Jewish and (3) they speak Hebrew. Living in the Jewish homeland, now that we are able to, is for Yehoshua not merely a desideratum; it is a necessary condition for wholeness as a Jew. And that puts the matter quite starkly, in value terms that are fundamentally beyond debate. For Yehoshua does not rely on the more conventional argument, the one that holds that it is only they who dwell in Israel who face life and death choices, that the rest of us cannot be more than sideline kibitzers; he is saying that we are Jewishly flawed — indeed, he later implies, deeply morally flawed — by virtue of our refusal to live where Jews are meant to live.

I would remiss be not to give Anderson props for the hiring of men’s basketball coach Mark Turgeon. Like Edsall, Turgeon wasn’t the top choice – it was Pitt's Jamie Dixon.
