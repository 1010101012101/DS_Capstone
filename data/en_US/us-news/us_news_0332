The choices might include fried squash blossoms with a sumptuous ricotta filling or shell beans with tomato and a breadcrumb topping, finished in the wood-burning oven.

He was also a victim of the passivity of others who stood by as he was beaten to death.

Art House Productions in Jersey City is featuring performances and visual artwork as part of its JC Friday series, among them the iconic paintings of North Bergen-based artist Ray Arcadio, in an exhibition titled “Progression.” The theme is how an artwork changes over time as an artist’s response evolves. Arcadio is showing one of his imaginary portrait series, this one called “Red Bull,” showing a black woman with red skin, crazy eyes and horns above her head. Arcadio is also a graphic designer and was a co-founder of culture-jamming street group Artfux. Another score or so of artists is included in “Progression,” as well as poets and performance artists who appear every Friday from 7 to 10 p.m. in the sixth floor space at 1 McWilliams Place in Jersey City. The show will continue through March 25, when a closing reception will be held from 4 to 6 p.m. Free. Art can be viewed by appointment as well as during performances. For more information, call (201) 915-9911.
Today, I received an envelope with a check for $2,100, which I deposited in my bank account. I became leery as to why a stranger would send another stranger that amount of money.

As the countdown entered the final hours, forecasters revised their take on Friday afternoon's weather. There was a 30 percent chance that low clouds or stiff crosswind could force a delay, a slightly deteriorating outlook.

Thorndike's book stays inside one narrow Alzheimer's narrative. Reiswig writes striking vignettes woven into a much broader cloth, one that encompasses not only one clan's spectacularly bad fortune in the genetic lottery (11 of 14 in one generation alone are felled by Alzheimer's, most in their 40s or 50s), but a brief history on the scientific study of the disease.

In his first trip to the plate, the Indians right-fielder yanked a Rich Harden fastball over the inside of the plate for a two-out, first-inning homer and 1-0 lead.

Hunting cougars, which are also called pumas or mountain lions, was banned in California in the early 1990s, though it's legal in Idaho and many other states.
It's not so hyperbolic to say that Elizabeth Bowen may be the finest novelist most people have never heard of. Perhaps she would be better known if it weren't so difficult to survive her books unscathed; she drills down to the most painful and naked vagaries of the human psyche. In "The Death of the Heart," her protagonist is a 16-year-old orphan, Portia Quayne, barely tolerated in the home of her half-brother and dazzled by a charming and amoral young man. She is trying to puzzle out the essential question for any adolescent: "I don't know what I was meant to be." Her utter innocence is a terrible foil to the adult behavior around her, the polite calumnies and the barely concealed perfidy so palpable as to make the reader feel like a collaborator. The book is set in London but the only terrain that matters is emotional and psychological; in other words, the title is not histrionic, simply descriptive. "Oh, you'll forget when you've got more to remember," says the housekeeper who is the only decent member of the household. It is a measure of Bowen's moral authority that the sentence doesn't mollify but terrifies.

Shurmur: "We looked at each pick and there was a cornerback discussion each time we chose in this draft. We are going to look to improve our team throughout. Unless we pick a corner here in the last two picks. Then we will just continue to develop the guys that we have, work with the guys we have and who knows what will happen beyond that. There are trades that happen. There are things that happen after the draft, once you see what your team is like. Then as we compete through the OTA's, we will see how they all work together. If we have to make moves, we will make moves to make the team better."

Her imagination also takes her to her notebook, where she loves to write poems and draw. Angelina's combination of creativity and depth in everything she creates is inspiring.
City leaders should be applauded for establishing a victim hotline to address cases of rape or sexual assault not fully investigated by police. The nonprofit fielding these calls has already been involved in providing access to SAFE services, but many other potential helpers could be better informed. An important next step is to increase awareness of the Jane Doe services available to city residents. Indeed, we must all work to make sure that providers and police officers are following this law so that the next teen or adult sexual assault victim is not subjected to unnecessary retraumatization.
