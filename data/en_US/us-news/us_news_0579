"You and (then-Sgt. Eric) Torgerson arranged for meetings under the Morrison Bridge and at NE 42nd and Sandy. You admitted that the meetings were personal. You admitted using bureau equipment to communicate with Torgerson and to arrange for meetings with him.

His selection as the top pick was hardly a stunner. The Colts informed Luck last week that Commissioner Roger Goodell would announce his name first. Right behind him was Griffin; no suspense attached to that pick, either.
While investors worry about how Europe's debt problems could hurt the rest of the world, there are also concerns about the job market in the U.S. An unemployment rate of 9.7 percent remains one of the biggest obstacles to a strong domestic rebound.

Why now? Harvest in Sonoma County should kick off any day now, which translates into constant activity in vineyards and on crushpads around town. It's also a good time to check out Coppola, while it's still a relative secret and visitors have the wine-tasting bar and memorabilia (the surfboard from "Apocalypse Now" is in the house) to themselves.
Joyce was shot in the head, and he died four days later. He was a graduate of Duchesne High in St. Charles and had a brief stint with the Minnesota Vikings football team. The year he died, he was on the Rams' offseason roster.

Each faces a potential sentence of up to 10 years in state prison with a five-year period of parole ineligibility.
On his final days with the Cardinals: " . . . in St. Louis it just got crazy. The fans were upset with me, the coaches (were) just banging heads a little bit and I just wasn't comfortable. I couldn't relax and play. So, I think the coaches over here, like last year when I came in, the outfield coach was cool and just told me to just go out there and play. ‘I know, you know, that you messed up, whenever something happens I don't have to come at you and breathe down your throat.' I already knew I messed up and I already knew I was doing things wrong but just that added pressure, I didn't have no way to filter it out. It just kind of ate me up and it showed in my play."
The bus was too tall and wasn't able to clear the low-hanging span, according to Walsh, who said he believed the driver made a wrong turn when getting off the interstate.
Biggest disappointment: Imprisoned innocents. Despite proof that innocent people have been imprisoned in Brevard County — three men have already been exonerated — none of the state officials who could call for an independent investigation into the matter has done so. National justice groups think others were wrongly placed behind bars as well. But Gov. Charlie Crist, Attorney General Bill McCollum and State Attorney Norm Wolfinger continue to ignore the calls to action.
In San Francisco Superior Court, Bay Area fishermen John Tarantino and Steven Fitz filed suit, asking that the owners and operators of the ship pay for the losses they are incurring and for a fund to monitor marine life in the bay and nearby ocean.
Accretive makes money through base fees for managing a site as well as through incentive fees, which are a portion of a customer's increased net revenue yield. Its net services revenue rose continually through the economic downturn, gaining 28% to $510 million in 2009 and 12% to $126 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the year-earlier periods. Net income was also up in both periods.
I mean, sure, we have real, live people sitting in jail for crimes they may not have committed — people whose innocence has been championed by expert legal minds. And Charlie won't lift a finger to look at those cases.
Democrats are a wee bit offended. They say West’s remarks are reminiscent of Republican Sen. Joe McCarthy’s anticommunist witch-hunt in the 1950s. Well, yeah. But I think we are a long way from another Red Scare. Compared with the powerful McCarthy, the first-term congressman from Florida’s balmy beaches is a pipsqueak.
The drive: On the spectrum of driving, this car is wonderful from "This is us in a drive-through" right up to "For the love, where's the fire?" Everything about the driving experience is composed and capable. The chassis has a solid, European feel to it; it's clear this car's suspension was tuned across the pond as it falls on the stiff side of comfortable, but this is a good thing. Body roll is nicely controlled and the car has plenty of grip throughout turns, a trait undoubtedly helped by my tester's extra-grippy tires. Putting the car into GS mode reduces body roll further, and noticeably tightens up the steering. Sport mode is largely moot; either you're driving hard or you're not.
But with few exceptions everything seems to be falling for the Bears’ sports team this year.
A collection of a writer's prefaces and random prose pieces often feels like the mustard-stained bread crusts on a child's plate after lunch. Nutritive quality? Low. Value? Marginal. Overall response? Ugh.
The departure of forward Sébastien Le Toux, Philly's only reliable finisher, and veteran goalkeeper Faryd Mondragón have some Union fans feeling like the third-year club has taken a step back.

EUGENE – Bryan Bennett could have clutched up Saturday night in Autzen Stadium.
The vibe: Happy hour is known as Capitol Hour here at Dawson's. The moment you enter, the leather chairs, black granite bar top and dark mahogany wood will make you feel as though you're in an old- fashioned chophouse. Two flat-screen TVs sit by the bar and show sports, and instrumental music plays in the background. The dim lighting, artwork and hanging lamps lend the bar and restaurant an elegant and upscale feel.

If you're like me, it becomes hard to know how we're supposed to feel about all of this, or what the right course of action is. In a sense, that seems to show we are becoming a bit more sophisticated in how we use and respond to social media, that we're pausing to think more deeply about the issues, rather than act reflexively.
"Somebody has to step up and make it happen. The individual at-bats, we have to have more quality. (Hitters must) recognize what's happened and go and do something about it."
"It doesn't matter in the big scheme of things if he's got the support of the fans or the administration," said Mike Vrabel, the NFL linebacker and former Buckeye who played with Fickell at Ohio State and remains one of his best friends. "In the short term, he's got to have the support of the players, and I'm pretty certain he does. That's what's important, that's what will get these guys through this time. As he does that, fans will start to realize what they've got and the administration will realize what they've got."

The Republican uses actual all-funds spending in 2010 compared to projected all-funds spending in the 2011 fiscal year, which is only about three months old right now. But the state didn't spend $3.3 billion that had been appropriated for use in this past fiscal year, which inflates this number greatly.
Their father remarried, and the family settled in Ontario before moving to Corona in 2002. Hinkle also spent vacations in Indiana — and later Michigan — visiting his mother, who also remarried.
A: I truly believe I have the best job. I'm clearly not remarkable; I work for a remarkable man, Jerry Reinsdorf. He's so committed to making a difference. My job is being the person who coordinates all that. We have to figure how do we connect (with the community)? How do we give back? How are we present in the hearts and minds of people?
It would seem like a sixth straight state title is a long shot with so many holes to fill. Then again, very few expected Collegiate to win one. It has lost other talents, only to reload. Huff isn’t worried about the streak ending.
Signability: Despite the impressive strides she has been making, it's still not clear who she wants to be, musically speaking. Give her the chance to choose her own song, and she picks a Miley Cyrus tune, which shows she still may have some growing left. (RC)

If next year's Republican primary electorate looks like the Tea Party -- focused on fiscal responsibility, lower taxes and smaller government above all else -- Daniels could be a strong candidate. He took Indiana from deficit to surplus, cut state spending and won re-election by a landslide in 2008, even as Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state's presidential vote. Term limits mean he's out of a job after 2012; he'll be looking for something to do, no matter what.

Al and Armelia did not condone their son’s public venting last week, but they understand. And they’re quick to remind those who label their son a malcontent that he never complained about being demoted with the Cardinals, who moved him to safety.
The face of the work force changed over the years as the plant expanded its operations. From 1956 to 1978 during the heyday of textile bags, sewing machines rattled away as women stitched together burlap bags, sacks and tarps. In 1969, the plant doubled its space with a 50,000-square-foot addition for its plastics operations. Now, mostly men deftly handle the heavy machinery to convert pellets of polyethylene resin into packaging through a process known as blown film extrusion.

Chief among the latter is the coffee seabass ($9), an appetizer swirled with a coffee sauce that reminded me of Mexican mole, the chocolate sauce, since it juxtaposes a seemingly incongruous element that works like a charm.

But, unlike the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, Florida, the U.K. tour doesn’t feature theme park rides like roller coasters.

The report repeated evidence that reducing sodium in American diets — from today's average of more than 3,400 milligrams to the 2,300 mg (about a teaspoon) a day recommended for most healthy people — could prevent 100,000 deaths each year. (African Americans, people middle-aged and older, and those with high blood pressure are advised to consume no more than 1,500 mg.) The report also noted that, though such recommendations have been around for a long time, sodium consumption has generally risen since the 1970s.

A similarly conceived photo differs in that it's a much more closely cropped shot of the upper back of an Afghan police officer preparing to patrol a village. The back of his turban-topped head catches your attention, but what's even more noteworthy is the bullet belt worn around his neck as if it were a necklace.
The idea is part of 15 ready-made ordinances the Citizens Campaign has put together for New Jersey residents to take directly to their local governments. They call it the "People’s Tool Kit" and say it can help curtail property taxes without waiting for state action.
Cannizzo is currently a resident artist with Tri-Cities Opera in Binghamton, N.Y., where she most recently portrayed the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor “with abandon and astounding control over her instrument.” She will be joined by Alok Kumar, tenor, in a program of romantic duets.

The romantic duet program will include music from Bizet’s “Carmen,” Donizetti ‘s “Lucia di Lammermoor,” “La Boheme” “West Side Story” and more.
We all know the answer. It's because marriage is simply a legal contract between two people. A marriage performed by a judge or court clerk is no less a marriage than one performed in a church, synagogue or mosque. You have to obtain a marriage license from the state in order to get married. If you want your god to be involved in your marriage contract, that is fine, but the U.S. Constitution gives me the right to keep her out of mine.

You can find 900 statistical models for picking the NCAA tournament on the Internet, which is a sign of a society with way too much time on its hands. The problem with computer models is this: You create a formula, plug some numbers in, discover that no matter what you do, your computer picks MIT, and then you call customer support to chew them out, only to hear some genius who went to MIT cackling in the background, so you buy a new computer, create another formula, tweak it again, and then watch your picks bomb. Computers are just dartboards with a reflective sheen.

4. Try open shelves. Caprara loves open shelving. "It's a good way to open up a room," she says, adding they're easy to make, even for the DIY novice. She says three small shelves cost $12 in wood and brackets from Home Depot, but make quite a statement on her kitchen wall. They're great for displaying everything from pottery to picture frames to artwork.

"Royal Pains": There are just so dang many of these USA series, I can't keep track of them all. Which may explain why I've never watched this one, about a doctor (Mark Feuerstein) who winds up working in the Hamptons, dealing with the rich and mildly ailing.

Rebel Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner had lent money to the down-and-out Grant in 1854, and figured Grant owed him a kindness. Grant wrote him in reply: "No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works." Buckner was horrified, but complied on Feb. 16, 1862. Outside the Dover Hotel (the surrender house) is a large reproduction of Grant's note.

The discovery marks the first time archaeologists have found such massive construction from before the time of Herod, the ruler behind numerous monumental projects in the city 2,000 years ago, and shows that Jerusalem of the Middle Bronze Age had a powerful population capable of complex building projects, said Ronny Reich, director of the excavation and an archaeology professor at the University of Haifa.

By the way, the more body hair a man has, the more difficult it is to scrape oil off of his body. In the words of Mark, there’s “too much doggone hair.” Last week we had crazy beards. This week is body hair. I can’t wait to see what’s next.
The commissioners of the bistate agency, which runs four Philadelphia bridges that link New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are expected to consider rules to bar employees from engaging in politics while on the job, whether to make charitable contributions and whether to eliminate an administrative job that an audit says isn't needed.
"There's just so many dimensions to his influence. You have a person who has had a direct impact on the lives of thousands of students, but he's also had a profound influence on countless tens of thousands of others just by his charismatic, powerful message and his commitment to quality and inclusion."
Nick Allen, who goes to Lincoln Elementary, asks why does a pen have to be called a pen? He decides to invent a new name: frindle. After he makes it up, students start using the word "frindle." Then the people in the town start using it. Soon, it spreads across the country.
Those early top-line numbers are getting most of the attention, but at this stage the campaigns are more interested in what the deeper data show. And though each survey has a different overall result, there are areas of consensus among them that point to the candidates' main strengths and weaknesses, and the nature of the November electorate.
Officials said the writings mentioned "a murderous rampage similar to the VT shootings" at "another highly populated university." Only weeks before, a student at Virginia Tech fatally shot 32 people and wounded 25 before killing himself.
Kovats had spoken by phone with her husband, Peter -- also an experienced sailor -- just before the storm hit. He told her he and his friends, who were wearing life jackets, were on their way back to Montrose Harbor and were trying to beat the storm, so she knew they were relatively close.

Maybe the most compelling interpretation is that these finicky pieces reflect a self-contained, bizarre world inside the artist's head.
The old coach sat there in a white Carver jersey sporting a Faulk Hall of Fame cap and a grin that was as wide as the stage in front of him. "It was humbling, just humbling to be around this all weekend long," said Reese. "It wasn't just about (Saturday night). It was walking around all weekend and hearing Marshall and so many other people come up to you and recognize the things that we've done."
"We were able to build the park and to keep it natural," said Tracy Kerth, recreation services manager for the district. "It's lovely."

A: We were really trying to carry our sound from Timeout Drawer, which was instrumental post-rock, and we all got a little, I guess, impatient with ourselves and that sound and being instrumental, it felt self-centered in this strange way. We felt like we had aggression built up — and as Timeout Drawer, we got heavier through years and as the albums progressed, that was sort of leading up to this. With Beak it's a reincarnation of sorts. We wanted a heavier sound and vocals. That's what has been inside for a few years and we were just locked into this other thing; this is license to break away and seek new territory and still maintain (that) same adventurous feel, a storytelling feel that we had in Timeout Drawer — even though we are a metal band, a rock band, it still retains a progressive guideline.
I wasn't sure. I think out loud — to everyone's dismay — weighing the following:
"We got the recipe for the Coney Island sauce from one of the guys who used to work in the kitchen," says Rogoway, whose own relationship with Nick's is long and close.

Schueler is the fastest female sprinter in Oregon since the great Margaret Bailes Johnson in the late 1960s. She also placed fifth in the Class 5A cross country meet last year.
But on the same day that The Sun reported the professors' findings, it also published an article detailing Mayor Rawlings-Blake's efforts to evaluate all of her department heads with an eye to shaking up her Cabinet. She is asking them all to discuss how they and their departments can help to reverse Baltimore's population loss and improve services for residents and businesses. She has indicated a particular interest in revamping the Baltimore Development Corp., which got a lot of criticism during the lead-up to September's Democratic primary for focusing too much on the big downtown projects that Messrs. Coates and Friedman question in their report and not enough on small business formation and growth.
The Broncos could get more than a third- or fourth-round pick for Tebow, but they would need more than one team to show interest in acquiring the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner from Florida. And the Broncos would have to make it appear that they're not opposed to keeping Tebow, even with Manning on their roster.
If governments default on their bonds, banks that own them could take a significant hit. It could become very difficult for these banks to borrow and nervous depositors could flee with their cash. In the worst case, a global financial panic could be triggered, in which banks all over are too skittish to lend to each other. That would cause a credit crunch that deprives businesses of the short-term financing they depend on for day-to-day operations.
"Anger was not even 1 percent of what that man was," Eli said of the Stack he knew. As for politics and policy, "He wasn't passionately married to any of that stuff."

Indiana Democratic Party Chairman Dan Parker said Donnelly has the best shot against Mourdock because Hoosiers have a tradition of picking senators, including Lugar and Democrat Evan Bayh, who know when to put politics aside. While Lugar's history of working across party lines became an anchor in the primary, it would have been an asset in a general election race, he argued.
"My father is adamant we have to stay to oversee the situation," the 30-year-old said. "He said even without electricity, we will still have something to live on."
The report contains several horror stories involving instructors who foist their opinions on students and it cites some tendentious course descriptions and reading lists. You don't have to be a Republican to object to a computer science instructor who calls Arnold Schwarzenegger a "Nazi actor" or a community studies teacher who (according to a student) used her course as a vehicle for a "personal vendetta against the state of Israel, against Zionism, against Israelis and against Jews." Subjecting a captive classroom audience to a one-sided political harangue is poor pedagogy, and so is stacking the deck in reading assignments.
Indianapolis Museum of Art: There are more than 150 acres of art, gardens, natural areas, a museum and a historic home (Oldfields-Lilly House). Adjacent to the museum is the Virginia B.

The Timbers were a confident bunch after coming off two consecutive home wins before their trip to Los Angeles to face the Galaxy. The result? A Galaxy blitzkrieg of two goals in the first eight minutes and a rapid loss of morale leading to an embarrassing 3-0 loss. The loss to the Galaxy continued what has been a trend of bad performances on the road. Portland (4-3-1 overall) is winless on the road (0-3-1) and except for the 1-1 draw at New England, hasn't looked good in the process of losing.
A police spokesman said Roman came to the school to retrieve the drugs and was arrested instead.
“He actually had good stuff, man,” McDonald said of Davis. “I was impressed. He had a lot of life on his ball, more than I expected. I don't know what's worse, giving up the three-run homer or grounding out into a double-play to end the game. He got the win and hat's off to him.”
Baxter describes detailed walking tours of the area surrounding the Paris Opera and the adjacent grand boulevards of Paris. He also includes the seedy but always fascinating Pigalle neighborhood and its Moulin Rouge dance hall, which is, Baxter notes, an expensive cabaret/restaurant and still features the can-can. There are the charming if touristy Montmartre; the crowded Latin Quarter and Notre Dame; the Saint-Germain-des-Pres neighborhood, once the haunt of jazz musicians, philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and members of the Lost Generation; the Luxembourg Gardens; artsy Montparnasse; and the Eiffel Tower.

In 2009, the National League Central has only gotten spicier when it comes to seething rivalries. There was the Pittsburgh Pirates putting the P in HBP. There was the Cardinals landing Cubs favorite Mark DeRosa, and Jocketty bringing Scott Rolen back to the division. The Milwaukee Brewers kept un-tucking and added their bowling-pin performance to the mix, though that was reserved (completely coincidentally, no doubt) for a NL West team. This past week only added more zing to the welcome return of animosity between the Reds and Cardinals:Mudgate. The Cardinals fumed about the sheen on the baseballs in Cincinnati and made not-so-veiled accusations that Bronson Arroyo used pine tar to get a better grip

In all, the company built rubber dams for 200 lakes in the U.S., but Tempe posed the most severe conditions for sunlight and temperature, Darden said. The Tempe dam also is the only one to fail, but it still survived the 10-year warranty period.
What makes Mount Clare such a national treasure, said Smith, is that it contains nearly 90 percent of its original furniture, silver, paintings, dishes, glassware and other artifacts that belonged to the Carrolls.

Parishioners and clergy across the nation are coming to similar conclusions lately, as the creation care movement spreads from congregation to congregation. Rain barrels, once ubiquitous on the family farm, gave way to garden hoses decades ago. Irrigating from a rain barrel saves water that would otherwise come from a municipal water system. It also reduces runoff and erosion, keeping bacteria, pesticides and other pollutants out of streams and rivers.

Global credit markets will not forever tolerate Treasury's current level of borrowing, nor will younger workers accept the huge tax increases  and diminished future  necessary to finance these programs as they stand.
From the beginning, Gingrich's campaign was tumultuous. Within weeks of entering the race, he was slammed by fellow Republicans for calling GOP Rep. Paul D. Ryan's Medicare overhaul plan "right-wing social engineering," and was deserted by nearly all of his advisors after taking a luxury Mediterranean cruise instead of campaigning and fundraising. His campaign schedule was bewildering, with chunks of times devoted to book signings and movie screenings in states that would have little say in choosing the GOP nominee.
Notes: Gasol said he and his brother's respective Game 7s on Sunday would be watched in their home country of Spain. "They do love basketball," he said. "We got a whole country behind us." ...

Experts in the West Virginia University Extension Office suggest starting with a mix of two parts sterilized potting soil and one part coarse sand or perlite. To ensure sweetness of the soil, add 1 teaspoon of lime per five-inch pot. There should be an inch of gravel at the bottom of each pot to ensure good drainage.
But few experts believe that the court would take such a drastic step, which would entail striking many provisions that have nothing to do with the mandate, including new initiatives to boost public health, improve the quality of medical care and train more doctors and other medical professionals.

The Troubadour Reunion shows are performed in the round, on a circular stage that slowly rotates. This is a democratic choice, but also a frustrating one. No matter where you sit, King and Taylor are in partial eclipse for much of the show. The video screens at Madison Square Garden did compensate, a little, but it still seems to be an odd choice for a couple of charmers who have built their reputations on establishing sustained face-to-face connections with their listeners.
"Circumstantial evidence can be very damaging," Cheronis said. "The defense is going to have to address that in opening statements. They'll have to explain to the jury that this is not about celebrity or Jennifer Hudson. It's about whether the state can prove its case."

"Obviously, we didn't do too many things that helped us out there. We didn't convert," Flacco said. "We didn't really keep ourselves on the field for a very long time. We hurt ourselves with a couple of penalties. We turned the ball over. All things that aren't really a good recipe for winning football games."
Shinji Kurita is a perfectionist, and diners with a taste for exquisite Japanese fare are the beneficiaries. His omakase dinners (reservations are required) have included stunning sushi, like keiji salmon and bluefin otoro. And the giant Madagascar prawn in black bean sauce is a marvel.
Apple isn't the first company to be dominated by a charismatic visionary with a perfectionist streak. Consider Walt Disney Co. after the loss of its namesake founder, Ford Motor Co. after Henry Ford or Wal-Mart Stores Inc. after Sam Walton. Disney slumped for two decades before Michael Eisner revived it. Ford reached its peak in the 1950s, a decade after Henry Ford's death. On the other hand, Wal-Mart, which Walton built into the world's largest retailer, continued to expand after his death in 1992.

"We have a cleaner, harder and better surface than would normally be expected with a greenfield site," Appelbaum said.

None of that has happened here."

In St. Louis, frozen custard means Ted Drewes. And why not? With lightning fast lines and iconic delights such as the Flying Dutchman and the Terramizzou, Ted Drewes is a tradition. But frozen custard in St. Louis also means being faithful to the stand closest to home. Becoming a regular. Ordering your favorite. And it means sharing a summer night on a hot, sticky parking lot with your kids, friends and neighbors. Some favorites:

We have indoor bathrooms, hand washing sinks and things like that.

According to a state study that helped push for the referendum, as of 2006 Georgia was investing less per capita in transportation than all states but Tennessee. Without new spending, metro Atlanta could forgo 250,000 potential new jobs over the next 30 years, it found. A top national relocation consultant said major firms are turning away from metro Atlanta because of its reputation for traffic congestion.

The first tiebreaker in the draft for teams with identical records is strength of schedule. Because the Bears played a stronger schedule than the Cardinals, Cowboys, Eagles, Jets, Raiders (their pick now belongs to the Bengals) and Chargers, they pick last among all the 8-8 teams. And picking 19th as opposed to 13th definitely could cost the Bears dearly. If you say the Bears' biggest need is an edge rusher, the Cardinals, Cowboys, Jets and Chargers all could use one as well (though each of those teams runs a 3-4). If you say the Bears really need an offensive tackle, the Cardinals, Jets and Chargers are threats to take one of them. And if you still want another receiver, the Cardinals, Jets and Bengals all could ruin the Bears' plans. As for DeCastro, I think 19 is too high to take a guard who is not elite. If you are going to reach, don't do it for a guard. Do it for a player who can impact your team with big plays. I really don't see guard as a need for this team.

That decision said the cases were brought to embarrass the trio of county officials and that evidence suggested the sheriff conspired with the prosecutor to intimidate the judge with unfounded criminal charges. But the panel said it didn't have jurisdiction for potential criminal cases.
"I've still got a little blood on my sleeve from Mitt Romney from that debate," the former Pennsylvania senator told 400 people crammed into Chief's sports bar in Greenville, S.C. "We're not going to shy away where there are differences." He also alluded to Romney's position switches on a series of issues, saying: "We've got a lot of candidates that just adapt to whatever the environment is .... I don't, because the truth doesn't change."

If austerity is gone, it's not clear what will replace it. France's Holland has talked of hiring 60,000 teachers and launching stimulus-style infrastructure projects. Other countries have discussed similar ideas, all in the hope that fresh spending would rev moribund economies and boost hiring.
About 300 people gathered at Kelly Point Park in Portland, Ore., and Kari Koch, organizer with Shut Down the Ports Working Group of Occupy Portland, said she expected hundreds more to picket the nearby terminal.

On each application, you can apply for up to six permits (six people) and for up to seven dates.
"I can tell you that coming over from New York and playing here that first year (in 1997), it was tough to get motivated because the fans weren't the same," Leyritz said. "Every at-bat wasn't the World Series, and it took me a little while to get used to the slower pace. I'm sure that's what he's going through right now is that this is a little different pace than it was in St. Louis. It's different surroundings. It's going to take some time to adjust. Once he makes that adjustment, the rest of the American League better be careful."

The showing could renew Wall Street concerns about Google's moneymaking prowess under the direction of co-founder Larry Page, who replaced Eric Schmidt as CEO last April. Page, 38, took the job with a reputation for being more willing to invest in long-term projects at the expense of short-term profits. In the latest quarter, Google's operating expenses rose 34 percent from the previous year, outpacing a 25 percent increase in revenue.

When it was over, there were eight trades involving 12 of the league's 32 teams and draftniks breathlessly trying to keep up with the organized mayhem. It all started when Minnesota swapped its No. 3 choice for Cleveland's No. 4 pick. The Browns, who also gave up a fourth, fifth and seventh-rounder, desperately wanted Alabama running back Trent Richardson. The Vikings still got the guy they sought in Southern California tackle Matt Kalil.

This is not the first time Adele has been forced to scrap concerts. Shows in Britain were postponed earlier this year after the initial occurance of the singer’s vocal chord problems. Over half of the American concerts on her “Adele Live” summer tour had to be rescheduled after she contracted laryngitis. Adele has vented her frustration on her website, and her disappointment at missing the U.S. dates is heartbreaking to read. "Singing is literally my life, it's my hobby, my love, my freedom and now my job," she writes, "I have absolutely no choice but to recuperate properly and fully, or I risk damaging my voice forever."

Enter the California Teachers Assn. and the state PTA. They realized that saving money on public school also would have meant fewer jobs for teachers. So they lobbied for the rewritten bill that ultimately passed. It created an earlier, "transitional" year of kindergarten for the children with birthdays from Sept. 2 to Dec. 2. Though the new year would have served only a small group of students, it would have cost a lot — because teachers in the program would have had to be credentialed. Therefore, it would have canceled out any general fund savings.
Bailey did not respond to interview requests Monday. Mark Gheduzzi, senior vice president of facilities at the Prudential Center, declined to discuss the event as well, referring all questions to the public relations department.

Any home over 40 years old is a likely candidate for having an outdated electrical system. Check the electrical panel for the amperage rating - modern homes require at least 100 amps and many require much more. Older homes may have "fuse boxes" rated for 60 amps or less.
No such outrage, though, accompanied the choice of Texas A&M kicker Randy Bullock by Houston in the fifth round. Or the subsequent selections of kickers Greg Zuerlein in the sixth round by St. Louis, that of Blair Walsh of Minnesota four picks later in the sixth, or of Buffalo's choice of John Potter in the seventh. None of the TV talking heads exploded. There were no reported insurgencies in any of the four cities involved, with mutinous season ticket patrons threatening to cancel their renewals, or demanding refunds.

Rybak used union resources to perform work at his home as well as at the homes of friends, including Dimora and former county employee J. Kevin Kelley. Union money also was used to make a contribution to the campaign of County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones.
"Would you agree that it is incredibly unusual for law enforcement to make a deal with a drug dealer that he won't be charged if he goes to a private organization and helps them with their investigation?" Hardin asked.
It would be hard for the kitchen to outshine the wine anyway. The list offers something for everybody. And while it's not deep in any particular region, it gets in a bit of everything, including reds from Molise or Abruzzo in Italy, a Shiraz from South Africa and a red from Texas. There are some big dogs too: an Ornellaia, a Scavino "Bric del Fiasc" Barolo, a Château Cos d'Estournel and some grand cru Burgundies. But those aren't the bulk of the list, where prices start at $29 for a Pieropan Soave from the Veneto region and a number of bottles are less than $50. Drink up.

The issue of Romney's alleged callousness toward Seamus stems from a much-publicized trip the Romney family took to Canada in 1983. With no room in the family station wagon, Romney placed Seamus in a kennel, which he strapped to the roof of the car for most of the 12-hour trip.
With millions of Americans still unemployed, political pressure has grown in the United States to impose economic sanctions on China. Critics say China has undervalued its currency against the dollar. That has made Chinese goods cheaper in the U.S. and American products more expensive in China.

Now there could be no question  thank you, El Rushbo!  that the GOP is waging a war on women and this is all about women's health. Heaven knows no one wants to talk about the government giving orders to the church. No, it's about Republicans wiping out birth control pills  or as New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg put it, how the GOP wants to take the country back to when women were property.
Despite the uncertainty over Greece, markets in the rest of Europe staged a late rally to close higher, possibly as investors who had sold stocks in the run-up to the elections sought out bargains or on hopes that Hollande will push for more economic growth in Europe's strategy to fix the debt crisis

The Kardashians could be partly to blame for perpetuating this peep-toe boot trend in a season when it doesn't seem to make sense. The reality-star sisters are seen in paparazzi pictures and on magazine covers wearing chunky peep-toe booties with second-skin skirts and ruffled blouses or strong-shouldered blazers. Sure, the juxtaposition of a shoe-boot against a thin ankle elongates and slims the whole leg, but such extravagant and impractical footwear also indicates that the wearer doesn't walk much farther than from her chauffeured car to dinner.

He was linked to an attack on a Berlin disco frequented by U.S. soldiers that left two servicemen dead and prompted Reagan to bomb Libya in 1986, an attack that killed Kadafi's adopted daughter. Two years later, Tripoli was implicated in the bombing of the Pan Am 747 over Scotland. Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi, an alleged Libyan intelligence officer, was convicted in 2001.
— Best-case outcome: Hollande teams up effectively with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has led the crisis response with Sarkozy. His proposal to soften austerity measures is embraced by France's parliament and bond investors, allowing France to balance its budget on a slower schedule. His view that government spending will combat the recession proves accurate, other nations follow suit and Europe returns to growth in the next couple of years.
On March 12, police dogs found the decomposing body of James "JJ" Robert Willman, 19, who disappeared in November. His body was found in a conservation area off Columbia Bottom Road, about two miles from where Willman's abandoned car was found at a rest stop off Interstate 270.

Tom Nehring, who operates Kempo Martial Arts Centers in the Toledo area, tells parents to ask - in a casual, non-accusatory manner - about advanced programs and any associated costs before signing up.
He spends his Fridays in the operating room at Children's Hospital of Orange County — shoring up decayed teeth when possible, removing them when not — and says his oldest patients are typically only 18 months old and already have severe decay. It's not uncommon to have to put these patients to sleep in order to do tooth extractions and multiple fillings, says Mungo. Often, these are children who have gone to bed with a bottle of milk or formula since they were infants.
Yes, they do. Back in 2006, Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was convicted of Social Security fraud, took sanctuary in a Chicago storefront church with her U.S.-born 7-year-old son for a year to avoid being deported. She famously said, "I'm strong, I've learned from Rosa Parks - I'm not going to go to the back of the bus. The law is wrong." This led to her supporters calling her a Mexican Rosa Parks - and people of all races and ethnicities across the country were infuriated.

Most of the investors were from Sacramento and Stockton, where Van traveled to homes to pitch his companies, the SEC said.

P.S.: Have gotten numerous e-mails regarding how Chicago could top Detroit in seedings by winning Saturday, since both teams would then have 101 points, and Wings would have more victories. The answer, which forces me to do math: The first tie-breaker is regulation-and-overtime wins (acronym: ROW). Detroit and Chicago would each have 39. Second tie-breaker is points in head-to-head games, and Chicago already leads Detroit, 8-4.
"Pound for pound, children breathe in more air than adults due to their substantial growth and high metabolism," says Charles McGee II, executive director of the Josiah Hill Clinic, a local nonprofit with the mission of protecting children from environmental hazards and promoting community action for healthy homes. "A sleeping child takes in twice as much air per pound of body weight when compared to an adult. And if subjected to the same airborne toxin, a child will inhale proportionally twice as much as an adult."

Workers should use an 8-inch diameter vacuum hose and a duct-scrubbing device. A semi-rigid air hose that uses about 200 psi pressure and a multidirectional pressure tip is a good scrubber. The high-pressure air dislodges the dirt from the inside walls of your ductwork; the dirt is extracted with a large vacuum unit that is usually mounted on a truck.
The USSF D-2 Timbers signed Goldthwaite, 28, in August. The 6-1 central defender made his season debut at Baltimore on Sept. 25 and then played in the second half of Game 1 and the full 90 minutes in Game 2 of the playoff series against Vancouver. A six-year MLS veteran, Goldthwaite started all 17 games he played with the New York Red Bulls before suffering a season-ending groin injury in 2009.

Although those measures are aimed at tamping down the unemployment rate, they do little for the working poor. A third of all labor contracts in Spain are for two-year temp jobs, with low pay and few benefits.

Young hasn't been here a full calendar year and it's pretty much accepted that he probably won't be here in 2013 -- regardless of his legal issues and admitted alcohol treatment.

3. It's not over even when it's over, part two -- Shades of Ruddgate! After the Browns committed pass interference on a Hail Mary play on the last snap, Detroit got another play on an untimed down in 2009. Quarterback Matthew Stafford had been hurt on the desperation heave, with his arm looking like it had been extruded from a pasta machine. But he used the timeout the Browns stupidly called after the penalty to recover well enough to send backup Daunte Culpepper off the field and throw his fifth touchdown pass. With the PAT, the Lions won, 38-37.

Boeing and the other companies currently receive a government subsidy to keep prescription drug benefits for retirees. So far, they've been able to deduct all of their expenses, even though the government was paying some of the bill. That ends in 2013 under the new health care overhaul.

For instance, a fund might offer to pay $40 million for a $100 million block of mortgages from a bank in distress. Then the fund could arrange to have some of those loans refinanced into mortgages backed by an agency like the FHA and then sold to an agency like Ginnie Mae, a government-owned corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which guarantees investors the timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans.

Today, exports support nearly 10 million American jobs. Overall, U.S. agriculture supports 1 in 12 American jobs in all sorts of industries from picking and processing, to packing and shipping, to shelving at your local market. Farm exports support more than 1.1 million jobs here at home. A few weeks back, President Obama signed into law a major piece of his jobs agenda: new trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. These agreements will support tens of thousands of jobs here at home, put unemployed Americans back to work, and open new opportunities for American businesses. For America's farmers and ranchers, the trade agreements provide our best opportunity to build upon what has been a record year for U.S. agriculture. Combined, the agreements will generate an additional $2.3 billion in farm exports next year alone.

"Then there was a period when I had a negative reaction to (the 'post-black' label). For years I think I perceived blackness in arts as this ghettoized space and a limitation, but I don't anymore. I don't feel my conversation is limited by being lumped in with other artists who have similar things to say. I am conscious of racism and I don't want to ignore the typical black subjects in art — urbanity, poverty. But that's not my exclusive concern, either. I think a lot of young black people grow up viewing being black as a monolithic experience, that you are supposed to behave a certain way. When I lived in Chicago, living up to certain black standards and expectations was my battle — how do I and who I am fit into that conversation? Certainly a lot of my autobiographical pieces are about that, more about addressing a black audience and inner-community concerns than teaching a white audience that black people have different hair or whatever."
“You can’t control that,” McMillan said. “Everybody is talked about (in rumors).
