When I moved to my home more than 20 years ago, there was a dead rose garden surrounded by boxwood. The roses had died because the house had been empty for a year. The first thing I did was dig up the dead roses, work the soil and plant new roses. Then I stood back waiting for them to explode into glorious bloom. They died.

By this time, Beverly Merrill is now dancing at various North Jersey establishments under the name Danielle. Maher, deciding he wants to have a kid but that Beverly isn't "mother material," eventually splits up with her. According to the epilogue, Maher last saw her in 1992 dancing at a club called Shakers in Carlstadt.

Who dines here: Hotel guests and locals find their way here (the wine room is big for wedding receptions) and the bar area becomes an LA-like house party come brunch time. For prime-time dinners at night, the windows inside reflect the restaurant interior too much.

That year, though, the California Attorney General's office sued, claiming YTB was a "gigantic pyramid scheme." The suit and a similar one in Illinois, were settled, but forced fines and big changes to the company's business model. The last few years have seen management shakeups, more business-model changes and steadily dwindling sales. Through the first nine months of 2011 – the most recent data available – revenue was $21.1 million, with losses of $3.3 million and just $189,000 in cash on hand. Last year, YTB sold its headquarters for $7.1 million. In February, it sold 19 acres next door for $500,000.

As befits the state of our nation’s politics, too, Clooney’s good-looking liberal is almost beside the point, a handsome face to slap on some very Obama-esque posters. The real campaign is waged behind the scenes, fueled by underpaid interns and overcaffeinated consultants.
Blackwell's criticisms of the usual liberals targets are predictable in his newest book. (Though the book's press release notes that Blackwell will make a decision in the coming weeks about running for the U.S. Senate, the book does not mention U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, whose seat is up next year.)
Essayist Lopate and Susan Sontag were acquaintances for many years, but this book is not a personal reminiscence in any fundamental way. Rather, it's a critical memoir, in which the author looks at Sontag's personality and her work to explore his own deep ambivalence about her as a cultural figure, framing her as at times brilliant and at times utterly self-indulgent, much like the times she sought to reflect.

Sunday, her mother led the gathering in the recitation of a work of prose titled, "Say Their Names," which implores the relatives of crime victims to say their names aloud as the months and years pass.

Louisville lost more games in an eight-day span starting in late February (three) than the Wildcats have all season (two). There is a reason the oddsmakers have made Kentucky a nine-point favorite, and why Louisville is viewed as a 10-1 shot to with the title.

Soul of Things and Suspended Night are essentially extended theme-and-variation suites, an approach partially echoed in the three noncontiguous sections of Lontano's title track. However, while lush with the group's trademark long, lyrical lines and contemplative moods, Lontano captures even more of the quartet's edginess and explores a wider variety of musical ideas, including reinterpretations of "Kattorna," from the Krzysztof Komeda quintet's 1965 Astigmatic LP, and "Tale," from Stanko's 1975 Balladyna.

When this sense of time is disrupted -- as in several illnesses now under study -- the world can become a chaotic jumble of seemingly unrelated events, or of effects attributed to the wrong cause. Chronically taken by surprise in an illogical world, a patient with what's increasingly known as a "temporal disorder" might respond with irrational anger or fear. Or he may feel helpless to understand how his actions affect things and people around him, and lapse into apathy.

Johnson says the pension bill is unconstitutional and wants a negotiated solution, though he doubts the unions "will forfeit money they are owed because politicians didn't do the right thing."

After a day of sightseeing, we dined at Capisce, a family-owned Italian restaurant a couple of miles south of the cove that was packed, even at 8 p.m. The wait after we ordered was long, but the server kept us stocked with bread and appetizers. And it was well worth the wait. Just know that the word is out about this place, so don't expect to pop in for a quick bite. You'll likely leave with a bag of leftovers, as we did.

The only difference with people like myself is that we never stopped drawing.

* Actually, there's no real "secret" to Kyle Lohse's excellent start to the season. The dude is a strike-throwing machine. Lohse is also proving, again, that it doesn't always matter how hard you throw the baseball. What's more important is where you locate pitches, and how you can control the count. Too many are obsessed with radar-gun readings, but velocity doesn't ensure success. Those going berserk over Adam Wainwright's drop in velocity should take note.

They certainly haven't for 11-year-old Cyril in "The Kid With a Bike," opening at the Crest today. Even the title works to set the mood  the phrase is clipped, the words sound hard, suggesting the boy in question is a tough one, relentlessly on the move.

“I think ultimately (I’m) another body,” Marks said. “We all know they’re a little short-handed now with injuries. So I’ve got to make my presence known in the paint and I think (with) defensive rebounding. That’s the key for any team to be a good, championship caliber team.

While there is still a chance that the Cavs could do a sign-and-trade with the Heat for James to get back future draft picks, it is unlikely they would take part in helping James go to another team.

Others asked us if we wanted some brownies, and we sat and ate the brownies with them. Then people started suggesting other people we should talk to. We started getting referrals like, you should talk to my co-worker, who is disabled and works with disabled children.

Pork not your thing? This same procedure can be used on whole chickens. The main difference is that you'll want to brine a chicken for just 4 hours, not 24. Of course, the cooking time will depend on how large your chicken is; just cook until the internal temperature of the meat is 160 F.

It is strange and empowering to recognize that secular justice has proved to be the most powerful source of sunlight in these dark corners of the church. Had it not been for civil lawsuits, for example, few would have known how the church in Oregon shuffled troublesome priests from place to place, allowing them to continue to oversee the young and emotionally vulnerable. And while the Catholic Church in Oregon has moved beyond the shame of those episodes, the damage lingers in the victims and tarnished trust in the institution.
Cornett woke up late on an April morning last year in her Harlem apartment. She was late for work at the UMDNJ in Newark. But moments later when she stepped into the bathroom, she couldn’t grab a tissue from the box. Her left hand wouldn’t work. Then she just fell to the tiles — her left leg had gone unresponsive underneath her.
State education officials say a rash of probes into cheating on school tests around the nation spurred them to look at what New York does to prevent such abuse. But the probes also raise an obvious question: Is some major new scandal about to explode in New York?

-- The controversy at the Potrero Hill Community Garden is over chickens, specifically a newly installed coop in one new gardener's plot. At last Sunday's semiannual meeting, I am told by J.P., an attempt to establish a "no chickens" policy failed.

* I am happy to know that NFL scouts and pundits were positive about Blaine Gabbert's Pro Day workout at Mizzou. He's a St. Louisan, he's a Mizzou Tiger, and it's exciting to think Gabbert could be the first QB taken in the NFL draft -- or perhaps even the first overall pick. That said, I do not really understand why there's so much value placed on a workout in a controlled setting, with a QB setting up to play pitch and catch. It's one thing about the NFL culture I dislike; this incessant need to overanalyze everything.

I'm still surprised when a menu prides itself in being so local even when the wines aren't, but that seems to be the way of the world these days.

The Broncos have the top-ranked rushing attack in the NFL and have been averaging more than 200 rushing yards per game in their five-game winning streak. At 6-3 and 236 pounds, quarterback Tim Tebow (75 carries, 431 yards, two TDs) is a challenge for any defender. Running back Willis McGahee (182, 886, four) has had six games of 100 or more yards, including 117 and 111 the last two weeks. The Bears counter with the No. 8 rush defense in the NFL and have enough speed to counter the Broncos' strength. But for how long? The Broncos' punishing attack takes a toll.

There is a consensus that some of the most significant Internet issues of our day are the protection of individual privacy and the collection of our personal data by third parties. When it is done with our knowledge, i.e., when we click on a website and we know or should know that some company is probably tracking us, it is bad enough because we don't know how that information will be used. When it's done without our knowledge, it's nefarious. And when that's done intentionally, it should be a crime.
I was inspired by the Vintage Seattle website in 2009.

The half-mile long street in Mount Pleasant's neighborhood is not pretty. I visited the street Wednesday and found that vacant lots and abandoned and neglected houses dominate the street, particularly its west end. Residents live an area that 2000 Census figures show has a poverty rate above 33 percent. The poverty rate for seniors and children is much higher. Households in the area are dominated by single women. When the 2010 Census figures are complete and crunched, the street will no doubt look worse, and that will have nothing to do with Sowell.

Jazayerli writes: "They're now playing a first baseman at third base, a third baseman (Jhonny Peralta) at shortstop, a DH (Fielder) at first base, and a left fielder (Ryan Raburn) at second base. Left fielder Delmon Young has the range of a fire hydrant, and apparently he has the personality of one too  he's on the restricted list after he was arrested last Thursday for aggravated harassment, after he allegedly got into a fight at his hotel and made anti-Semitic remarks. The Tigers aren't fielding a defense as much as some kind of weird social experiment, the sort of thing on which Randolph and Mortimer Duke would have wagered a dollar."

For years, TriMet has focused on capital, light-rail and streetcar projects, while neglecting its bus service -- the core of urban transit. And the Transit Riders Union believes it's now clear that it's not the poor economy that's pushing such cuts and proposed cuts. It's mismanagement.

The fruits, berries and chocolate used to describe coffee qualities come from a "coffee taster's flavor wheel," which is similar to but less elaborate than the wheel used for wine tasting. The coffee taster's wheel was developed in 1997 by the Specialty Coffee Association of America and its collaborators. Half of the wheel divides flavors into the standard broad categories of sweet, sour, salty and bitter, then breaks down those descriptions into 32 individual qualities.

(Bernie comment: The Schottenheimer offense with the Jets wasn't great, but there were some positives, including a big-play passing attack that helped the Jets reach the 2009 and 2010 AFC championship games. This past season the Jets were the NFL's best red-zone team, scoring 36 touchdowns in 55 opportunities. Under Schottenheimer, the Jets were ranked 17th, 13th and 13th in the league in points in 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively. They led the NFL in rushing in 2009 and were fourth in 2010. But overall, the Jets' passing game was disappointing, and quarterback Mark Sanchez, the fifth overall pick in the 2009 draft, hasn't developed into an elite passer, though he still has time to do so. As I've said before: Schottenheimer's work in New York was a mixed bag; critics can look at it and find plenty of ammo and apologists can look at it and find plenty of excuses. As always, the truth is usually somewhere in the middle, but I do believe Schottenheimer has something to prove in St. Louis.)

One part of the new prosperity is the Old Spitalfields Market. The enterprise dates to the late 1600s, and many of the buildings are from the Victorian era, but the market got a dramatic redevelopment in 2005 that brought in several sleek buildings (and, some would say, chased away some charm). On Sundays, you can browse arts, crafts, Kate Moss T-shirts, fancy soaps that look like dessert and fancy desserts that look like soap.

I understand the federal government trying to maintain as low an interest rate as possible, but they shouldn't be giving relief to those actual student loans. Getting financial relief from those other debts through bankruptcy protection will be passed on to the consumers, but relief from federal student loans will only cost the taxpayers. The federal student loan program was set up to be repaid and thus allow other students, in the future, to finance their education.
What we do know, however, are two key factors exist in 2012 that make even early-season missteps problematic for the Yankees: 1) The AL East projects as a beast with four teams — Yankees, Rays, Red Sox and Blue Jays — all legit contenders, which matters because 2) There is a second wild card this year. Thus, the penalty for not winning the division is either to miss the playoffs entirely or — at best — to play a one-game knockout to advance to the Division Series.

You can easily fritter away a day or two on a self-guided tour of artisans' studios; pick up a map at the Centro Cultural y Artesanal. This new culture center, containing a crafts museum and a shop selling the best local workmanship, is a perk of the Magic Pueblos program. But Izamal's main attraction is the astounding Franciscan convent of San Antonio de Padua. Bishop Fray Diego de Landa, who was to became infamous for burning almost all of the Mayan civilization's written history, leveled a pyramid here to build the monastery and church. When you walk along the colonnades high over the plaza, you'll know why priests believed they were close to God. Every August, pilgrims climb the massive staircase on their knees to seek miracles from the Nuestra Señora de Izamal.

But will banning them force kids to eat healthily? If students don't have vendors close to hand, there's a good chance they'll find convenience stores and fast-food outlets within a few blocks that also sell unhealthful food.

Gill built Dodge House using what was called a tilt slab method. Concrete walls were constructed on a flat, horizontal table. Openings for windows and doors were configured while the walls were on the table. After the concrete had set, the walls were tilted slowly into vertical position with a four-horsepower engine. Corners and other contact points were bound together with grouting. The method cut cost, helped to standardize construction and reduced the need for traditional wood framing. Gill fully expected concrete to become the "structural common denominator" in modern building, and indeed, the tilt slab method is still widely used in construction today.

Why are we harping on the price? Well, sunscreen works when you use the proper amount. That typically amounts to a few tablespoons every few hours that you are exposed to the sun. Human nature tells us that the more you spend on a cream or potion, the less likely you are to slather it on for maximum effect. Somehow, we tend to dupe ourselves into thinking that because it has a high SPF or because it costs 30 times more than another brand that somehow it's magically more effective even if we use a little.

It helps to understand the reason for the acquisition or merger. For example, the acquiring company might be interested in taking ownership of your company's product either because the buyer doesn't have a similar one or because they do and want to eliminate the competition, thereby increasing sales. As for your company, the board of directors, shareholders or CEO might be seizing a last-resort solution to a serious challenge, such as poor financial performance or over-reliance on a single product. Whatever the case may be, knowing the reasons behind the buyout might help you keep your job or secure another position within the company. Offer ideas that reflect your understanding of the new business goals. You might be given an opportunity to share ideas right off the bat because frequently, employees of a bought-out company are asked to reapply and re-interview for the same positions they currently hold.

Team Adam had the perfect response -- a gutbucket country-rock retooling of Jay-Z's "99 Problems" ("and a b---ch ain't one)." Rightly interpreting this as a personal attack on her cattiness, the show's resident diva complained and NBC came down on them and said they couldn't say the b-word even if the song were about a canine. Their solution was that he should substitute the word "chick." Thank goodness no one made that happen. Instead the word just went unsung. This did feel like a ridiculous bit of censorship, like when Ed Sullivan forced Sir Mick to sing "Let's spend some time together," but the point was made. Christina pointed out that Lucca's wife and daughter were in the audience and chided him for choosing this moment to sing a song that's derogatory against women. Then she told Adam (who recently broke up with his Victoria Secret model girlfriend Anne Vyalitsyna) "You have a girl problem." Ouch! Adam retorted that "bitch" was a metaphor. If that's true, then I'll be a son of a metaphor.

Dimora's lawyers are grasping at every conceivable advantage. For instance, they have asked Judge Sara Lioi to ban prosecutors and witnesses from using what they consider to be loaded words such as corruption, kickbacks, bribery and "political godfather" in reference to Dimora.

Rosalie further shows her mettle by scoring some "J" from an old drug dealer contact, giving it to Nick and Monroe so they can get into the "J" crack house/opium den (with color-coordinated red tents), which goes bad when Nick finds the bad guys, slugs one, but lets the other get outside to get the drop on Monroe. Just when our favorite reformed blutbad looks like he's going to get shot, Rosalie gets the drop on the bad guy and clobbers him.

The night of Jan. 28, thieves broke into the Egyptian Museum, located on the edge of Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the anti-regime uprising and scene of some of the bloodiest clashes between protesters and Mubarak's hated police. The robbers made off with 51 pieces that were on display -- of which 29 have since been recovered. The most valuable stolen piece, a statue of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, was found by a 16-year-old protester and his family returned it to the museum, the antiquities ministry said at the time.

Viewing art history through this New York-ish prism obviously has opened up over the decades, if not almost disappeared in the carnivalism of today's art world. And what I called L.A.'s "seasonal garden of odd little plants" has even more obviously become a very major force in the art world.

It endeavors to capture, as if firsthand, the work of the IRS in all of its enormous detail.
