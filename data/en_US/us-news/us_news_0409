The mess confronting Donahoe, the 35-year Postal Service veteran who became its CEO last October, has been building for decades. The Postal Service has been an independent government agency since the early 1970s and hasn't received direct tax support since the 1980s.

The most meditative of the Catholic prayers in the rosary is the Hail Mary, repeated in series of 10, over and over, as one meditates on key moments in Jesus' life known as the mysteries. "Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee," the prayer begins. "Full of grace" -- God's unmerited love -- and a reminder that God is always with her. God is always with me, too.

The administration deceptively conceals from people the true monumental decline in the number of working Americans.

"You've got to make plays," said Wesley Matthews, who finished with 10 points, six rebounds and three steals. "It's not always the big obvious plays, it's the little subtle ones that break a team's heart. They fight for a 50-50 ball and we come up with it and convert it.

43': France earns a free kick in the waning moments of the first half. It should be noted that French midfielder Camille Abily is really good.

They're pushing for a goal before half. Offside.

Charles Davis moved to Calistoga in 1999 and since that time the distinct aroma of charred meat and smoke fills the corner of Highway 29 and Lincoln, only a short walk from downtown. On some days you can see hunks of meat smoldering over the fire on the massive grill in the parking lot. Diners line up at the takeout window to order ribs, tri-tip or pork loin. Sandwiches are served on a buttered and toasted bun and doused with either mild or spicy sauce that leaves a tingle long after the last morsel is consumed. The menu also features sides including cole slaw and macaroni salad, which are respectable but not as memorable as the meat. Diners can sit on a screened-in porch or outdoors in the parking lot. It's bare bones, just as you expect from a good barbecue joint.

One of the compelling vistas — not that most eyes-on-the-prize marathoners usually notice — is of the ornate monastery of Our Lady and St. Therese, built across the highway in 1931 to house cloistered Carmelite nuns.

The physics of basketball demonstrate that an underhand free throw produces a softer shot with a higher arc, making the ball more likely to go in, than an overhand shot. Yet because it is sneeringly called a "granny" shot, manly players persist in their sub-50 percent efforts with the set-shot approach. Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Dudley and Jerome Lane, former Cavalier bricklayers all, are ready examples.

Brown was a rugged individualist above all: "I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself)" is perhaps the most emblematic of his (long-winded parenthetical) song titles.

-- Now Tiger Woods is even getting sympathy calls. He lost a ball last week on an errant tee shot.

Rose Wilder Lane and R.C. had a special sort of relationship. They carried on an extensive correspondence, extending from at least the early 1940's till the early 1960's. One of R.C.'s favorite aphorisms was attributed to Rose Lane. He was fond of quoting her statement that "freedom is self-control, no more, no less." After R.C. read her book, Discovery of Freedom, which was published in 1943, he wrote her a devastating critique. He claimed that he could not recommend Discovery because she had made one egregious blunder in presenting her ideas. Rose had assumed by implication that it was government protection of private property which made private property possible. When R.C. pointed this out to her, and explained that the State was the major violator of property rights, she was so chagrined that she bad-mouthed her own book the rest of her life.

3. Phil Mickelson, United States -- Mickelson was expected to make his return to the PGA Tour next week at the Wells Fargo Championship, and he made it official last week by committing to play in the tournament for the ninth time. He has a strong record at Quail Hollow even though he never has won, finishing in the top 10 in six of his previous eight appearances, including second behind Rory McIlroy two years ago. … Lefty also made big news in Texas when he committed last week to play next month in the HP Byron Nelson Championship for the first time since 2007. He has played in the event at TPC Las Colinas on 13 previous occasions and won it by two strokes over Craig Perry in 1996. Lefty had a close relationship with Byron Nelson and will be on hand as the tournament celebrates the 100th anniversary of Nelson's birth. … Mickelson is less than a month away from his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Fla.; the ceremony is scheduled for the beginning of the week ahead of the Players Championship. Even with his induction imminent, he continues to add to his accomplishments, posting his 40th victory on the PGA Tour earlier this season at the AT&TPebble Beach National Pro-Am. Since he won't be 42 until June, Lefty figures to have them rewriting his resume at the Hall of Fame for years to come. He is on one of his better streaks since perhaps 2009, with four finishes in the top four in his last six tournaments.

But, any place where a child is loved and provided for, has friends and safe places to play and learn is a great place to grow up. To the child, it doesn't matter how many parks a town has. What matters is how often someone takes them to the park.

But now, as county officials review years' worth of mortgage paperwork, in some cases combing through one page at a time, they are finding suspect signatures -- either signed with the same name by dozens of different people, improperly notarized or signed without a review of the facts in the paperwork -- on all sorts of mortgage documents, dating back as far back as 1998, The Associated Press has found.

Desperate for spring air, we opened the window in our bedroom the other night, despite the calls for the Storm of the Century of the Week to come through town and kill us all again. I fell asleep quite happily with lungs filled with fresh air and awoke to the sound of the rain -- a gentle rain pitter-pattering on the awning above our window. The only number my horrible eyesight could make out on the clock was 4, but I didn't need the clock, it just felt unnecessarily early. I'd been awake for almost five minutes when the first noises came filtering in from our boys' room.

No one has ever answered satisfactorily why Palestinians should have paid the moral debt that Christian Europe incurred for its centuries of persecution of Jews. In fact, no answer is possible. When the British, and later the United Nations, proposed awarding part of Palestine to Jews, they and other Western nations that dominated the organization at the time let themselves off cheaply. In the name of justice for Jews, a great injustice was perpetrated against the Palestinians.

We are paid to observe the practices (and hey, we actually got into Stanford's session on Saturday for 30 minutes) and interview players and coaches to get a sense for what they're thinking and how their brains and bodies are preparing for the game.
8. THE PHILLIPS AFFAIR: Reds second baseman Brandon Phillips had some mouthy things to say about the Cardinals, calling them crybabies and whiners and such. That sparked the Cardinals to an emphatic sweep of the Cincinnati Reds in Cincinnati. The series was spiked with full-on brawl that featured Johnny Cueto's violent kicks and a concussion for Jason LaRue that ended his career. The series wasn't the slingshot to a title that Cardinals envisioned. They stumbled to second after it, while the Reds surged to the postseason. But that series forever cast Phillips has a villain, Cueto has a nemesis and the Reds as a bad-blood rival. Remember when Walt Jocketty once used the word "vendetta" to describe the Reds games against the Cardinals? Now it goes both ways.

Illinois is having trouble scoring this season. Missouri is not.

Unless MU suffers a terrible shooting night from the perimeter, their pace should prevail over the Illini size.

The laughable monster in "Curse of the Demon" (1957, a.k.a. "Night of the Demon") can reportedly be blamed on meddling producers.
