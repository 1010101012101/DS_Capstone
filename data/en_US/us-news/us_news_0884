This week, I began negotiations with House and Senate colleagues on a transportation package to support jobs and infrastructure, and the good news is, there's an infrastructure project with shovel-ready jobs that we can include in this legislation, and it won't cost taxpayers a dime: the Keystone XL pipeline, which will carry Canadian energy supplies to American refineries.

It was very exciting for me. I'm a big fan of Janet Evanovich. She has 18 of these Stephanie Plum books out. When I read them for the first time, I put a book cover on my vision board and said, "Lord, if this ever becomes a movie, please let me get a role." The interesting thing is these books have such hardcore fans and their blog sites are packed with who should play the characters in the movie. For my character, I read Queen Latifah or Niecy Nash or Sherri Shepherd. I knew people were rooting for me, so that felt good. Then one day I was on Twitter and I read they were having auditions for "One for the Money." So, I put on a miniskirt and got to work.

There have been many legends as to how Valentines Day got started. One was about a Roman priest named Valentine who lived in the third century after Christ, who had a special feeling for young people and married them despite the Roman Emperor's decree that there would be no marriages as he needed all the young men to fight his wars. He was afraid that if the men married they would stay home with their wives instead, but Valentine was against wars. Because of his defiance, he was arrested, put in jail and put to death, but not until he became a friend to one of the jailers whose daughter was blind and when he blessed her she regained her sight.

Sale's velocity had dipped a tad in his last start on Tuesday, when he pitched six innings of three-hit ball in a win over Cleveland in which he threw only 88 pitches.

In January, the General Assembly passed legislation that became the Main Street Fairness Act when signed by Gov. Pat Quinn in March. For the first time, it required Internet retailers to collect and remit the use tax if they have affiliates in Illinois. Previously, Internet sellers were only required to collect the tax if they had a physical presence in the state.
Yet the orchestra's mission hasn't completely changed. Tensions still exist between the U.S. and Russia, with relations having gone through what Mike Hurley, the Moscow-based U.S. minister counselor of public affairs, termed a "rougher period" over the past few months. So the CSO's function as cultural ambassador may be well-timed.

The power struggle boils down to three main groups. There is the Muslim Brotherhood, already dominating parliament and seeking the presidency as well. There is the military, which may be trying to ensure a candidate amenable to its aims holds the presidency. And finally, there are liberal, leftist and secular groups, which drove last year's uprising but have not made strong showings in elections so far. They—and even some Islamists—are concerned about the Brotherhood gaining too much power but also do not want to see the generals keep their authority.

This is tifo, the fan-crafted displays of flags, banners and smoke in soccer stadiums. Short for tifosi, Italian for "fans," tifo on this scale is so new in the U.S. that MLS commissioner Don Garber said Thursday that he'd never heard the word. Portland fans have been talking and making tifo for years.

Bernanke acknowledged those improvements. But he mentioned that risks remain.

Then there is the matter of Panama's undisguised ambition to position itself as an intermodal hub for Latin American trade. Even an expanded canal will have capacity limits.

Invitation creates transforming experiences of community. Jesus invites Peter and James and John to climb the mountain with him, inviting them to see a glimpse of his glory. The power of invitation is openness to transformation and change. Perhaps that is why God speaks to the disciples on the mountain top, telling them, "Listen to my Son." Pay attention to the details, and be transformed. Take up the challenge to become a communities of invitation.

"It's definitely a challenge, but the listeners hung with me and hung with a guy who's not from here,'' Stelton said. "There were so many people who went out of their way to tell me, ‘Aw, you're going to St. Louis, they don't like people who aren't from there, they're never going to accept you.' The listeners proved them all wrong, which as a host is extremely satisfying and rewarding. And it was a hard decision to make to leave, the people here in this building couldn't have been classier or nicer.''

There are a few, but I find myself a lot at Big Al's Diner on Larchmere, maybe every other weekend. I love their big bowl of oatmeal with brown sugar and milk and whole wheat toast.

It's interesting, because the way I started working professionally started very organically from my acting school, and they started having auditions for things as a sophomore in college (she attends New York University's Tisch School of the Arts) for understudy roles in theater. Then I did off-Broadway and I did Broadway. I never got to go on for either show, but I worked professionally, and I got to do that while I was in school. And then my agent represents the woman who runs the school and saw that I was an understudy. And then she asked the woman who runs the school, "Is she good? Let me meet with her." That's how everything happened. ...

The ice cream experiment did more than provide a treat, it offered a hands-on look at freezing point and properties of matter. It proved the most popular demonstration, but was also the most labor intensive for participants. Aaron Cain, a junior from Pasadena, dropped salt and the creamer into an 8-ounce plastic container. Then, he instructed would-be tasters to fill the container with ice, add water, attach the lid firmly and shake vigorously for at least five minutes.

Of the dozens of commercial edging products available, probably the one used most often locally are long metal strips. Several times a year I face the unpleasant task of digging up clumps of bluegrass that have breached this product that lies between the neighbor's lawn and my flower beds. What the edging does show me is exactly where the property line lies, and it gives me a straight edge to work with. (What slows the grass in its trespassing march is a thick layer of organic mulch on my side of the fence.)

It would have been one thing if the U.S. had lost out to Australia, a country that has put on big-time sporting events with panache and has never hosted a World Cup. But Qatar is a huge risk for FIFA and suggests that it's possible to buy the World Cup. FIFA's own inspection team visited Qatar and was concerned that the 110-degree summer heat would put the health of players and fans at risk, even if Qatar says it will build air-conditioned stadiums and training grounds. What's more, 12 years is a long time away, and you never know what might happen in world politics between now and then. Choosing a safer bet like the U.S. or Australia would have been the logical thing to do, but as we know, FIFA doesn't always use logic in its decisions. If anything, the outcry over these choices will be the biggest incentive for FIFA to finally clean up its act.

Hence, my next step was to see the lawyer. Mr. Attorney was not really pleased the way the contract was written, but legally there was nothing he could do. Yes, you can get thrown out of a dorm over a non-credit class but you won't get kicked out of school for making D's in your credit courses. Go figure.
The drilling frenzy in the Marcellus Shale is also credited with enriching landowners and pumping new life into trucking companies, short-line railroads, quarries and steel-pipe makers, as well as the restaurants and hotels hosting out-of-state drilling crews.

CrashPlan backs up your newest files first on the assumption those mean the most to you, and it encrypts all files, so file names can't be read on remote servers or backup computers. I liked CrashPlan's straightforward user interface because it clearly showed me what my data were doing and where it was being stored. A section labeled "Destinations" let me choose where data was backed up and options included "CrashPlan Central" (remote servers), "Friend," "Another Computer" or "Folder." A section labeled "Files" showed exactly what was being stored; in my case, this meant 285,930 files. An "Inbound" section showed any computers that were using my computer for backup.

Both personal income and spending rose 0.4 percent in April, in line with what economists expected, according to the Commerce Department. Still, higher prices for food and gas ate up most of the gains in income. The report from the Commerce Department lags by a month, so the recent decline in gas prices isn't reflected in those figures.

BRUSHES WITH OSCAR: Clooney packed on the pounds, grew a shaggy beard and became virtually unrecognizable to play a CIA operative in 2005's "Syriana," which earned him the Academy Award for best supporting actor. That same year, he also was nominated for directing and co-writing the TV news drama "Good Night, and Good Luck." Since then, he's earned two other best-actor nominations: for "Michael Clayton" (2007) and "Up in the Air" (2009). Gosling was a surprise nominee for 2006's "Half Nelson" -- not because he was undeserving, far from it, but because it was such a small, little-known film.

After purchasing our candy, we'd hurry to the movie box office. The Saturday matinee doors opened at one o'clock with the show starting at two, but a crowd of us would be waiting in line well before one. At one o'clock we surged into the lobby, presenting our tickets. The ticket takers were often old men, tufts of hair sprouting from their gaunt chins and from their withered ears. Despite their warnings that we walk, not run, we raced to claim our seats, changing places several times before settling on a location.

There is one significant accomplishment for which all players must strive in order to get to the next level -- academic achievement. High GPAs and SAT and ACT test scores are becoming more and more important for football players, like regular students. We can mostly only vouch for physical ability here. But a 4.5 is not solely the measurement of a fast athlete. A 4.5 weighted GPA can open some big doors and they don't lead to the locker room.

You're not the only one who thinks so — new websites and public databases are being created to make prices more available to consumers.

The roots of Detroit's plight go back decades. Court-ordered school busing and the 12th Street riots of 1967 accelerated an exodus of whites to the suburbs, and many middle-class blacks followed, shrinking the city's population from a peak of 1.8 million in the 1950s to half that now.

And the second floor was good, too: unique bedrooms and a bathroom with that institutional-looking hexagonal-tile floor that was so popular back then.

Rutkow credits pulp with no less than democratizing reading, transforming food storage and revolutionizing personal hygiene. As always, the losers were the trees. However, by the turn of the 20th century, rapacious cutting finally forced the creation of protected timber reserves that became America's national forests. But, as Rutkow's book concludes, the coming threats are not necessarily the old problem of cut-and-run logging but climate change, fire, disease and pestilence. If the book's unbearably vivid accounts of past ravages of chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease are anything to go by, forest management is even more urgent today.

Also noteworthy about the GS's suspension is that the front setup also has incorporated into it something Buick calls HiPer Strut.

All of that must change.

Her push is part of a bigger campaign by the administration on the deal, which is under pressure partly because South Korea is close to ratification of a similar free-trade pact with the European Union.

The enchiladas Suizas ($10.99) is also a good bet for meat and/or cheese lovers. You have a choice of chicken or cheese  we went with one of each  topped with a green tomatillo sauce, along with onions and pepper.

These figures point out the ongoing need to adequately fund our public schools while keeping up the push for verifiable improvements in student achievement.

This is one reason so much of political activity on all sides is about leveraging, even stoking, our displeasure. Appealing to fury isn't a bad way to get large numbers of people to move in your direction. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Anger can move you to fix whatever's wrong with the state of things. Combined with a redemptive message, it has the possibility of achieving remarkable, positive change. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of the process of turning anger into a "transforming force." Even momentary outrage can move legislators to pass necessary laws and change less-than-ideal conditions.

The conversion was expensive - at $18 million, it cost more to make than this year's Oscar winner ("The Artist," $15 million). And it was ambitious and exacting in the Cameron tradition - he sent bids out all over the world for the best technology, and asked companies to "audition" for the job by converting the same piece of footage.

Monday, for the first time, I heard a clear answer on this subject from a senior administration official. He stated emphatically that the current U.S. troop drawdown from 100,000 to 68,000 troops by September will be the extent of the cuts for a while. They will be completed, according to a plan still being finalized by General Allen, and the situation then assessed further this fall, before any additional reductions are planned. U.S. and other NATO troops will still complete their main mission by 2014, but there will be no rush for the exits in the meantime.

Introducing the new Muppet Walter became something of a daunting prospect, and one that Segel and Stoller say they didn't take lightly. The story of the film is, in many ways, the story of Walter finding his place in the world — growing up with Gary in the picturesque burg of Smalltown, USA, Walter has always realized that he's not quite like everyone else, a point underscored in a visual gag early on in which he struggles to stand as tall as his towering sibling.

Kirby says sunflowers require less fertilization and pesticides than his other crops and are a welcome addition to his crop rotation. They're also beautiful.

On Christmas morning, Mom woke up to the crackle of gifts in a stocking at the foot of her bed. She followed the sounds of clanging pans that grew louder as she descended the stairs. Her eyes widened at the sparkling lights in living room. The "Christmas Song" played as she turned toward the clatter and gasped. Ryan, my then 19-year-old brother, whirled around the kitchen preparing all the dishes to accompany the roast, decorated in fresh herbs and painted in English mustard.

I've cut down the number of dishes, too. Each course relies on similar flavors, although they don't taste the same. That gives some unity to the meal, and also means I won't be left with odds and ends of expensive ingredients.
The Reds managed five baserunners before Phillips snapped Westbrook's no-hitter by lining a two-out, fifth-inning single into center field. The Reds needed Westbrook's assistance to break the shutout. Shortstop Zack Cozart lined a shot off Westbrook's left wrist.

For people who are married or in a relationship, sex drive also reflects the health of partnerships, for better or for worse. Resentment or power struggles can kill desire.

McClintock has tried to characterize himself as a teammate of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, but those coattails won't stick. As Garamendi pointed out in their debate before The Chronicle editorial board, McClintock opposed many of Schwarzenegger's most important legislative achievements: on trying to curb global warming, on raising the minimum wage, on creating prescription-drug discounts for the uninsured and on investing in transportation, education and housing in a bipartisan-crafted bond package.

Hey, Tony: Seneca Wallace admitting what we already knew, that he hasn't helped Colt learn the West Coast offense on purpose, is a great microcosm of the season and this organization. I'm not even saying that McCoy is the answer but it is borderline comical how he has repeatedly been set up to fail. Maybe Colt lacks the skill set to be a starting quarterback. Let's not forget that he is also the victim of, as you say, an organization that consistently ruins quarterbacks. -- Matt Jancar, Strongsville

I suppose I'm confused. Here you had this outlaw, renegade, out of control coach setting up bounties and sharpening a goon squad to wipe out helpless QBs with dirty hits ... and where was the NFL?

Departments have sometimes changed their mind on which segments to include in their measurements. In Los Angeles, as the city government was considering cutting the fire department's budget, the fire department reported it was meeting NFPA standards on about 80% of calls—not quite as many as NFPA guidelines suggest, but enough for the city council to approve budget cuts. Since then, the department has seen its performance drop markedly, so that it is getting to fires in time just about 60% of the time.

A real contrast in styles here. When Washington emerges from the locker room in a white wig and riding atop a white horse, the arena crowd goes wild. The colonial-era general getup makes for a great crowd-pleasing schtick, which we all know is ultra important in professional wrestling. But at 7 foot 4 inches and 500 lbs, Andre has always been able to rely on his sheer size rather than sartorial splendor. Washington's illustrious political and military career are utterly meaningless once he takes a shot to the chest from Andre's size 22 boots and goes down hard.

And let's not get carried away with McCown's performance against the Packers: His best quality Sunday night was that he wasn't Caleb Hanie. He was lauded for making simple throws that any college quarterback should make. He's still the guy who was cut by the 49ers in training camp in favor of rookie Scott Tolzien, the former Fremd and Wisconsin star. (And Jim Harbaugh knows much more about quarterbacks than anybody at Halas Hall - unless it was just his luck and coincidence that Rich Gannon, Josh Freeman, Andrew Luck and Alex Smith have flourished under Harbaugh's tutelage.)

Ms. Kessler-Harris acknowledges Hellman's prevarications only grudgingly, resorting to a tedious postmodern explanation that writers are entitled to their own version of "truth"—though Hellman insisted that stories like Julia's were literal truth. Despite voluminous evidence to the contrary, Ms. Kessler-Harris insists that Hellman's "concern for accuracy persisted throughout her life." Not when it came to her memoirs and certainly not when it came to communism's crimes.

Curry County, and other Oregon counties, will cease to function if Congress does not renew federal funding intended to replace decades of timber harvest revenue. The county funding problem stems from the steep reduction in timber harvests on federal forests, which makes up 53 percent of the land in Oregon.WASHINGTON - After yet another near-death experience, prospects for extending county timber payments for another year have brightened, with some supporters openly speculating that the critical source of federal dollars for rural counties once consider lifeless could clear Congress by the end of summer.
The two tribes (now one tribe called Tikiano) return from Tribal Council to a feast of wine and cheese. I think cheese would be one of the things I would miss the most if I were on "Survivor." While I reminisce about cheese, Alicia is adding some whine to it, complaining about how Colton getting sick ruined her plans, and how he should have given her the immunity idol. Shut up, Alicia. I hope Christina joins with the men after how you treated her, and she votes your entitled self off.
The flip side to Popovich's method: The Boston Celtics (15-17) have to play 32 games in 59 days. That includes an eight-game road trip that starts March 11. In other words, if they're playing for anything other than eighth place at this point, we're missing something.

Sara Rea, an executive producer of "Project Runway," says, "Portland has over the past five or six years put a lot more energy into the fashion world. We have definitely found it an area to find talent, and it's refreshing to find it outside of New York and Los Angeles. You get different types of people, with different aesthetics.

In addition, I cringe when I read that the archdiocese chooses to spend its political capital in Springfield and in the public arena denouncing civil unions, gay marriage and the right of gay couples to adopt children (rights ironically grounded in love), rather than spending time and treasure advocating for legislation that assists the poor and others struggling in this economy.

He labels the company "dishonest" at one point and expresses the hope that regulators and auditors may still "remedy the situation." For its part, Allied calls Mr. Einhorn's book "a self-serving rehash of the same discredited charges that Mr. Einhorn has made for the past six years."

The only good thing about this promo was that it was done on the entrance ramp, a technique that needs to be utilized more.

You don't want to overreact to the rudeness, because doing so might actually reinforce the behavior, by providing the spotlight the kid's trying to hog.
