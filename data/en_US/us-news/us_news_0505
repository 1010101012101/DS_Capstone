Teddy the Pigskin Picking Pup might have started the season slow, but now he's on a serious roll. Will he be able to maintain it?
The Series TV ratings outlook is dim, given that the American League championship series drew the worst number in the history of that event and the NLCS had its second-worst number. So longtime Fox Sports executive Ed Goren is rooting for a seven-games Series, because interest builds the longer it lasts - and it hasn't gone the maximum since 2002. In fact, there has been a Game 6 just once in the last seven years and the record low rating has been set or matched four times in that span.
New rules proposed by the Labor Department were met with an outcry from several major companies in the retirement industry.

"What really got the Union's attention, especially Mr. (Abraham) Lincoln's attention, was the rich silver that was coming out of the area south of Tucson," Trimble said. "He was given some specimens, and money talks. The Union was trying to finance a war. ... There was only one little problem. What the Arizonans were claiming as Arizona was really south of the Gila River, Doña Ana County, and that was the plan at first. Nobody thought much about the northern part."
"Here" was the Providence Cancer Center in Northeast Portland, a leading facility in cancer prevention, research and treatment.

The Wings have been a beat-up and oft-beaten team lately, and this 7-2 victory over Columbus was welcome in every way. I won't make a big deal of them building a 4-0 lead on the Blue Jackets before half of the fans found their seats. At that point, the Blue Jackets called time-out, presumably because it beat the alternative, which was to keep playing.

One of the areas Murphy noted was Ohio's ability to aggressively defend, especially on the perimeter where it allow opponents to shoot just 29.6% from three-point range, 13th in the country. Given that U-M likes the three-pointer and is coming off a horrific shooting performance, that's an area to watch. Plus the ability to create turnovers, which Kampe said became "pick sixes" in his game, steals racing down for transition lay-ups.

France is nowhere near the Greek situation. As of late last year (and before the second Greek bailout), France's debt stood at 86% of GDP, vs. more than 150% for Greece. But France's political and economic direction matters greatly to Europe as a whole: Among other things, France is a pillar of the region's shared currency, the euro, at a time when euro-zone members are still searching for a solution to the overload of government debt menacing their economic union.

With the three sisters’ stories unwinding over barely an hour-and-a-half, the film can feel as if it’s rushing things at times; another 20 minutes of character development wouldn’t have hurt.

"He's given us energy, but I know that he feels he hasn't shot the ball well," Brown said. "That's why he stayed and got some extra reps.

It's hard to become invested in any suspense about the outcome, even if you ignore such obvious clues as the old fable of the frog and the scorpion (well told by Turner) or a prayer rife with unintended consequences.

The county commissioners approved $232,000 for a transit museum at the county ag center south of Hagerstown. The site will feature exhibits of trains, planes and automobiles, basically meaning that everything that used to provide jobs in Washington County has now been relegated to a museum. And when there are no jobs, people naturally will resort to a life of crime. But unlike seasoned criminals, these newbies frequently display more proper manners, including a Hagerstown man who receives a lighter sentence for the robbery of a local bank because he asks the clerk, "Can I please have that stack of money?" Under Maryland law, harsher sentences are reserved for robbers who actually threaten violence. The man further impresses the judge by saying that robbing another bank "is not something I'd ever see myself doing in the future."
Consider the House's 2004 roll call on his bill. The vote, not especially partisan, was 59 in favor, 35 opposed. Of the 59 House members who voted "yes," only 11 are still in the legislature.

Mr. Rourke is a formidable physical presence, just as he was in "The Wrestler," but he's the cyborg equivalent of a punch-drunk heavyweight when it comes to mortal combat (or, rather, "Transformers," which "Iron Man 2" often resembles). Here again, it isn't his fault. The ostensibly epic battles between Iron Man and Ivan in his battle gear are staged for maximal impact with minimal ingenuity, apart from one bright sequence in which Ivan puts a Rolls-Royce through an ad hoc chop shop with laser whips that he wields like a demented lion tamer.

"Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland" captures the Canadian rock trio Rush -- featuring singer-bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart -- during a sold-out concert at The Q in April.

In this exclusive essay, Peart (the group's lyricist and best-selling travelogue author) reflects on the "Time Machine" project, memorable rides through Ohio via bicycle and motorcycle and Rush's long-standing affinity for Cleveland (where disc jockey Donna Halper was instrumental in the group's early success), despite being snubbed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The Dragons scored first off a free kick five minutes into the match. Angelica Soto of the Stingrays tied the score with a touch shot on a cross from forward Deirdre Heavey. An incredible bending corner off of the left foot of Megan Sicord broke the tie. Shelby Willis assisted Heavey with a pin-point through ball to make it a two goal cushion. Despite the big lead the play was quite physical with Stingray defenders Tori Jacques, Nena Marquez and Willis consistently thwarting the Dragon offense. In the second half newly installed midfielder Kyra Noble finished off the scoring for the Stingrays from 20 yards out on a solid pass from Alicia Soto. Keeper Natalie Grogan had five second half saves to frustrate the Dragons. Megan Norr helped Noble secure midfield with new Stingrays Bella Calero and Antonia Maguire adding much needed offensive punch along with veteran Grace Wilson for the Stingrays who are now 3-0.
Varejao factor: When Varejao was not selected as an All-Star reserve, he comforted himself with the fact the Cavaliers were in the playoff hunt. A day later the Brazilian center fractured his wrist. His loss -- the Cavaliers are 3-8 without him -- is becoming more glaring by the game.

Q: Now that we see that Chris Bosh was the right choice in 2010 free agency over Carlos Boozer and Amare Stoudemire, what a about this year? I don't think Baron Davis, Kenyon Martin or Samuel Dalembert would have made any difference. In fact, Shane Battier was probably the best fit for the Heat in hindsight. -- Jeff, Wellington.
But making a film that Chinese and Western audiences both want to watch is tricky. The 2010 remake of "Karate Kid" swapped Japanese karate for kung fu, yet the film performed badly in China, where audiences did not warm to a bully-boy depiction of the Chinese. And what will the need for Chinese-government approval do to the quality of co-productions made for the American market?

"We put a lot of full faith and trust in our agencies and we hold them to a high standard," he said. "To find out that we've been taken advantage of, that's extremely disappointing. I thought all my agencies were good, honest agencies."
Of course, this burden is not ours alone to bear. This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, al Qaeda's safe-havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaeda and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.

I applied to the city, looked into perhaps developing the lots that were vacant and was told in no uncertain terms, "This property cannot be divided. It cannot be separated." Reluctantly, I decided to sell it because the resistance was very high. I sold it to a gentleman, and he said he was going to renovate the house and that was the only plan.

Kirkus Reviews: That voice comes through strongly on every page of this memoir, an engaging assortment of recollections comprising a journey that started in her working-class Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, took her to Manhattan and Laurel Canyon and saw her escape what Joni Mitchell called "the star maker machinery" to settle in rural Idaho. In one of the book's best sections, King explains her decision to retreat from fame in the mid ’70s, chronicling the joys and sorrows of going “back to the land” as well as the tempestuous relationships she had with two men during this period. She is also refreshingly candid about her four marriages. A warm, winning read that showcases baby-boomer culture at its best.
øGo north of the border, however, and the day becomes one big party -- especially when it lands on Saturday, as it does this year. In the U.S., Cinco de Mayo has become a lively and fun commemoration of Mexican culture.
A college student picked up in a federal drug sweep in California was never arrested, never charged and should have been released. Instead, authorities say, he was forgotten in a holding cell for four days.
Maybe Minnesota fell behind the nation in the mid-2000s simply because its economy (and housing market) became a bit less bubbly and overextended than others around the country, since we now know how fragile and unreal the prosperity of that time was.
Most of the feedback I heard about the story centered on similar personal reactions to its portrayal of Kirksville. As someone who graduated from Truman State (then Northeast Missouri State, actually), I'm probably too close to the subject to be a fair referee in any case. But the gist of my traffic was clear.

Two assessors office workers -- manager Blair White and administrator Michelle Smith -- testified that back then sales took months, sometimes years, to be keyed into the system, then months more before they showed up on the Web.
The Avs are the youngest team in the league and I can't help but notice the need for some veteran leadership. Sure we are playing great but I shouldn't have to tell you that we are the streakiest team in the league. Maybe some veteran presence added in the offseason might chalk up some high level consistency. Anybody on the market fit the bill? Can this current streak continue into the playoffs?

The margin was less than 10 points for only 90 seconds of the third quarter. Stoudemire went to the bench with his fifth foul with 6:41 left in the third, and Miami went on an 11-2 spurt not long after to all but seal the outcome. It was 67-58 when Fields made two free throws with 4:49 left in the quarter — and then the Heat's "Big Three" needed just 3 minutes to blow the game open.
Actually, it is not. For starters, it is a phony interpretation of the 1970s disabilities law that was never intended to be an affirmative action measure, some note. The Labor Department replies that the quota isn't affirmative action, which is akin to saying a nose punch is not a nose punch, just cosmetic surgery.
The unpredictable violence and the kidnapping of foreign workers have created a climate of fear in this country. We weren't allowed to visit villages outside urban areas, where 40 percent of Pakistanis live. Two shotgun-wielding security guards protected our buses in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. We entered our hotels through metal detectors and were rarely allowed to interact with average citizens in public places.

Trailing 38-30 at the half, Arapahoe, which trailed twice by 11 points early in the third quarter, gradually came back behind Jensen and Kocur. The Warriors, who began to sit on Adams as well as keep Calvert in check, got within 48-44 entering the fourth quarter.
This little play, about some men who held that American dream of having their own home, while knowing it was very nearly unattainable, resonates in our modern times. Millions of homes were lost to banks in the 1930s, just like in the recession from which we may now be recovering.

Researchers are tracking 80 children (the youngest is 2, the oldest is 21, the mean age is 9) with HIV. The children, all patients of McComsey at Rainbow, live across Ohio.
I certainly fell within that camp of skeptics. I suspect other editors had the same question I did  why is the California HealthCare Foundation funding the center and how will that affect the reporting and writing? What tipped the balance for me early on and as we've worked with the center is the caliber of journalists who have signed on. They're legit.

That Annapolis game — the buzzer-beater in overtime. That was a great feeling. I was happy the whole next day. It was amazing, and words can't describe it. I had fouled out in the fourth quarter, so I was sitting on the bench. The coach called a play in the huddle, and Darien Bryant went around a screen, and I just saw the ball go up and then it was in.

Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are two of the funniest, most well-liked TV performers in America. Teaming them in a movie comedy made perfect sense. Adding a dash of Steve Martin, a dollop of Greg Kinnear, and the au courant theme of surrogate mothers sounded like a night of laughs.
Boyd has struggled with injuries and inconsistent performances since leaving the SPL. He signed with Middlesbrough and was loaned to Nottingham Forest of England's League Championship division, scoring a combined total of 12 goals in 39 appearances with the two teams in 2010. Then came the disastrous stint with Turkish Super Lig team Eskisehirspor. Boyd signed a multi-year contract with Eskisehirspor in July, but terminated the deal in December, claiming he was never paid. He left the team after having played a total of 76 minutes.

UCLA's best offensive lineman has not played in two years. Xavier Su'a-Filo left on a Mormon mission after the 2009 season. Senior Jeff Baca will play somewhere along the line. After that, line coach Adrian Klemm is not sure who he'll send onto the field.
Contending that Perry's cowboy message of self-reliance and independence from central government that carried him to three terms as governor won't play well outside Texas seems to me like whistling past the graveyard. A wise old political observer once told me never to underestimate the irrationality of the American electorate in bad economic times when straw-grasping becomes all consuming.

Coughlin also expressed support for being a "good steward of the environment," but said he doesn't think it's wise to set up a system of environmental benchmarks and penalties. He called that a "very false system of rewarding good behavior which really, at the end of the day, is only a money-making scheme for the folks that are the authorities on it."
Now with contention this season, despite all the caveats about the weakness of the division, with August and September maybe becoming a summer that ends with a bang, fans are upset that the Indians traded for a Cy Young-caliber pitcher. Jimenez won 19 games last season, struggled with a blister problem early this season, and is just now coming on. I throw out Saturday's debacle with the Rockies because he was distracted by the trade rumors.
The flap over this cartoon does illustrate the difficulty editorial cartoonists, who are generally white men in their 50s, have in dealing with race, Rall said. As for African-American cartoonists, "as far as I know, there's only one or two working in the entire country."

"All the sudden, at least from a media's perspective, it would become a division that's not lost in the shuffle like it's been in years past. I kind of hope that that's the case just because it's always fun to play a Peyton Manning-led football team. To play him twice a year that would be a battle like crazy to win the division. I hope it happens. One thing you know about him, he's going to be thorough and make the best decision for him that gives him the best chance to go win. And if that ends up being Denver then it will be exciting."

Franzen cut the piece by 25 percent, but never did get out all the stridency. That's why it remains so powerful, and if you haven't read "How to Be Alone" you're better off going with it than with "Farther Away."

In much of the world, the rains come with spring. Here in the Bay Area, rains come with autumn. So now, not spring, is the best time for Bay Area gardeners to plant trees, shrubs and native plants. Our California native plants typically go dormant during our rainless summers. They wake up and undergo a growth spurt when it starts raining. Native California plant societies hold their biggest sales in October. Nonnative shrubs and trees also benefit from a fall planting because rain helps establish thriving root systems that will support lush top growth in spring.

It was also far away from Santa Barbara but not too far. Roberto did not say that he picked Oregon State because in Robinson he found someone the opposite of his father. Robinson played at Princeton and then professionally in Europe for a few years.

The Rams have struggled to sell tickets in St. Louis; this gives the organization one less boulder to push up the hill. And the Rams will receive a revenue boost from an annual "home" game in London.

In saying there are practical limits to America's ability to transform Afghanistan, the president was stating explicitly what has been apparent for years. To paraphrase an idea often expressed in regard to the halting Mideast peace process, Americans can't want a stable, democratic Afghanistan more than the Afghans themselves do. If Afghans want to build a modern, democratic society that respects the rights of women and minorities and gives all its citizens greater opportunity to better their lives and those of their children, they are going to have to do it themselves. We can't do it for them.

Private business and all government, local, state and national, require capable and effective leaders. Competition for such leaders is fierce in the private sector, which is reflected in high pay for these. The public sector must offer salaries for its leaders that are competitive with salaries in the private sector. If such salaries are not offered, public sector institutions will be mismanaged. The best example is the California energy crisis of 2001 - incompetent and underpaid state elected officials 'reformed' the state's electricity market at an eventual cost to the public of approximately $45 billion. To avoid such disasters in the future, salaries for managers at public institutions must be brought to the level of the private sector, starting with the governor who is grossly underpaid.

In his classic, "In the Night," set to Chopin, Jerome Robbins evoked three different romantic relationships, blending dance and theatrical characterization in subtle ways. The delicate but forceful Rocas and the ever-poetic Villanueva beautifully captured the passion of youth. April Daly and Miguel Blanco (tense but accomplished dancers) suggested a practiced formality, if little love. And Jaiani and Calmels danced up a storm as the volatile, "can't live with, can't live without" pair.
The extended video of the incident, showing the chaotic aftermath of the spraying, with the crowd screaming "Shame on you!" as the injured students clutch their faces and roll on the ground in pain, as some are cuffed while they lie face-down in the grass, is almost as harrowing to watch as battle footage.
