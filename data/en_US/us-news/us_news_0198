--Walking adds years to your life. Yes, that's a plural: years. To get more life out of your walks, just pick up the pace. You don't have to walk any longer. Simply add several short, 30-second bursts of faster-than-usual walking to your routine. In between these mini-power walks, return to your usual pace. This alone could add an extra four to five years to your life.

As I was a true child of the ‘80s, "Flashdance," "Footloose," "The Thornbirds," "When Harry Met Sally" were stories of my growing-up years. I easily believed everything I saw and wanted my life to be just like it. I waited patiently for Tom Cruise to mix me a cocktail, John Travolta to dance with me and Meg Ryan to become my best friend.

"A stalled conflict in Libya does not serve our national interest," Kucinich said in a press release. "Given the uncertainty, instability, the continued threat to civilians, the inability for rebels to continue their rebellion without the support of NATO, the fact that the rebels have exhausted their financial resources and the fact that the Gaddafi government seems to still be standing despite the tremendous military onslaught, it is time for a renewed effort to bring about a peace agreement."
Jackson’s sudden death stopped the clock for days. But cracks in the King of Pop’s gilded crown had always been apparent: His songs were dark, his vision was a troubled one, and his life seemed remote from any experience that any of us might have. Even at the height of his fame, he seemed off-balance, intentionally alien, impossible to fully identify with.

The filmmakers solicited advice from survivors , incorporated archival footage, and filmed scenes using elaborate sets, models and a massive section of the ship built on a concrete foundation. Some scenes were shot outside in an icy reservoir. The emphasis on realism paid off in unexpected ways. Hydraulic jacks that were used under the sets to make them tilt caused the sets to creak, mimicking the groans of the dying Titanic. Mr. MacQuitty, in fact, said that "A Night to Remember" could be considered a documentary, with the ship as the star. This presented a marketing challenge in the U.S., where Jean Negulesco's 1953 melodrama "Titanic," starring Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb, had won an Academy Award for its screenplay. But "A Night to Remember," a striking example of realism in British narrative cinema, was praised by critics in the U.S., earned a Golden Globe and gradually attracted wider audiences.

Oregon has all the right pieces this season. This is the most complete team in state history. The Ducks have depth, and speed, and experience in all the right places.

In other cases, upset victories reflected pundits making over-confident predictions based on insufficient data. Two weeks prior to the famous 1948 election, Thomas Dewey was so far ahead of Harry Truman that pollsters simply stopped measuring public opinion.

The university doesn't want to look bad. It wants to repair its image, and show that things can be done in a controlled, civil way. Civil disobedience meets civil obedience; that sort of thing. It would be nice if they had thought to do it this way right from the beginning, but never mind.

The top of the department store's 80-foot-tall Christmas tree rose above us, taking our view to the oval-shaped domed rotunda itself. It's an amazing display of sculpture from 1909 that once graced the inside of the historic City of Paris department store, where Neiman Marcus now stands. The sight is reason enough for a visit, along with the great views and impeccable service.

AURORA —
Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson's recent school reform plan, when taken in a larger context, is really just the latest chapter in what we in the education profession have been fighting for several years now -- a nationwide War on Public Education. Although the battles in this war have been fought on different terrain, the elements of each are always the same -- money, the elimination of political opposition and, like any good witch hunt, scapegoats. What is often blurred in the coverage of these battles is a truthful answer to the question we always ask in the education profession: What's best for kids?
"It should be no excuse to say you knew about match-fixing but did nothing about it, and that includes people at the very top of sports here," he said. "Without aggressive prosecution, you're not going to fix this problem any time soon."

Norskedalen, literally "Norwegian valley," is a few miles north of the small town of Coon Valley, which is just southeast of La Crosse, Wis. The farmstead at what would become Norskedalen was donated in 1977 to the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse and has grown considerably since then. The 13 pioneer buildings represent how Scandinavians set up their farms: Rather than one giant pole barn, they made many "outbuildings" to avoid a catastrophe in case one of them caught fire. The restored Bekkum pioneer cabin dates back to the 1890s and the airy, open space makes visitors want to settle in for a while.

Plagued by foul trouble for forward Deshaun Thomas, whose offense became both consistent and indispensable in the past six weeks, the Buckeyes (31-8) reverted to the ways that had caused consternation at points during the season, forcing some shots inside and outside while gradually creating fewer shots for each other. Sullinger was 2-for-11 in the second half and Thomas 0-for-6, and the Buckeyes as a team shot 24 percent over the final 20 minutes.
South Plainfield Fire Chief Thomas Scalera last week said while it’s possible the devices burned, investigators have found no evidence of them in Jefferson’s side of the house.
Hey, Tim: You have the right to defend McCoy, if you choose. I'm just of the opinion that Luck is the real deal, the truth, the consensus-best QB prospect since Peyton Manning, a QB in the class of John Elway. If you share that opinion, you do everything possible to acquire him. That doesn't mean giving up your entire next two drafts. I think quality players can still be found after the first round to continue building the rest of the team. By the way, the reference to Blackledge just doesn't wash.

By the third day all the rebels had withdrawn, fleeing in every direction into the suburbs.
Yes, I'm a season ticket holder. It was not difficult to decide I wanted Timbers Army tickets. As it's GA, I may migrate over to 107, but my heart belongs in 105. I love my kilts, cowbells and princess tiaras, with a side of mutton chops.

Just as McNamara in 1968 got the picture that antiwar Americans had an aversion to "bureaucratic tyranny," the Obama administration gets the picture that Americans of all stripes are averse to nation-building in faraway places. Even before Obama's first Afghanistan surge announcement in March 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates warned against "creating some sort of a central Asian Valhalla over there" (Valhalla is a reference to paradise). Just as McNamara endeavored to convey his sympathy for hippie attitudes toward depersonalized bureaucracy, Gates appealed to recession-weary Americans that he too is concerned about expensive, pie-in-the-sky nation-building missions.

Under proposals being pushed by Gov. Chris Christie, Rutgers would gain parts of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey — including Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, the School of Public Health and the Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Far more controversial, though, is the plan to merge Rutgers-Camden with Rowan University in South Jersey, a proposal that carries heavy political overtones and is being fought hard by Rutgers-Camden faculty and students.

The names of Rosenthal and Larsen may not sell a lot of tickets (and that also goes for crackerjack lighting designer Robert Wierzel), but their work is just as crucial as that of any of their higher-profile cohorts. It’s one thing to concoct a fantastical idea for a musical horror story that twists and turns between illusion and reality, from the past to the present or from here to the hereafter. It’s another thing to logistically represent those parallel universes on a theater stage.
Denver coach George Karl has done it time and again – cocked his entire defense toward Bryant, run double-teams halfway across the court and made Bryant's teammates beat the Nuggets. The fact that Bryant shot 27.5 percent from the field and 11.8 percent on 3-pointers against the Nuggets in his three regular-season games this season is a decent indication that the lion-quoting Bryant's favorite animal is still not the sacrificial lamb.

Such novels as "Felicia's Journey" and, most recently, "The Story of Lucy Gault" manage to be both claustrophobic and expansive, both lyrical and macabre -- a combination he has made his own since "The Old Boys" (1964) and "The Children of Dynmouth" (1976). When "The Collected Stories" appeared in 1993, its 1,200 pages seemed a kind of summing up; indefatigably, however, this octogenarian continues on an almost-annual basis to advance his art.
A report released last month suggests there's been a major resurgence in the number of start-ups operating nationwide. But some skeptics say that the study fails to take into account the potentially significant numbers of small businesses that shuttered last year.

1. Ordinary People (1980): The most famous case of the Academy blissfully ignoring the fact everyone else seemed to know, that "Raging Bull" was the finest film of the year. Did Scorsese refuse to pay his membership dues or what? Maybe, just maybe, I'd understand if the voters wanted to avoid honoring such a dark, depressing film. But "Ordinary People" certainly doesn't qualify as fun for the entire family.

Two sides to a story: Danielle's friends Kim Granatell, Kathy, Anna Maria and Sue meet her for dinner, where Danielle gives her perspective on the tete-a-tete. Suffice it to say, Dina's recollection is slightly more accurate. For example, we see Dina touch her head when she tells Danielle that she's (bleeping) crazy. In Danielle's mind, Dina is leaning down into her and waving her finger dramatically around in the universal sign for insanity. Then Danielle reads an email Dina sent her in which Dina tells her she was her biggest supporter and tried to convince the others to see her in a different light. Not sure if we believe that, but okay. She also accuses Danielle of causing chaos at the Brownstone on purpose. Which we do believe. Dealing with this whole Dina business, Danielle insists to her pals, is empowering!

They may not be as shocked as Gavin. His PR heading into the Suburban North meet was 20-11. For him, literally, the line in the sand was 21 feet. He banged his head on that mark last year, but never found the extra oomph to join the 21-foot club. He would do his thing and then watch as the area's best posted better marks by a little or a lot.

"I wanted to learn because my brother does music too," Connor said. Tunes from his brother's piano lesson down the hall trickled into Connor's lesson room tucked in the back of the shop. After Connor settled in front of the set, his instructor, Werner, directed him to play a few measures from a section of his music book titled "Funk Grooves." In a slow, determined manner, Connor struck the toms, snare and bass drums; behind him Werner followed the pattern, playing drum sticks on his knees. Contrary to what many might think, Werner said the sounds of kids banging on the drums doesn't get to him.

The differences between the three largely come down to depth and style. In their Sun-Times interviews, both Mahon and Miller answered questions on state issues with ease and expertise, though Mahon was more willing to take a firm stand. On school vouchers, for example, Miller said she would have to "see if the people want it."

Details: This mix is great. It's as close to conventional biscuit mix as you can get. Use it to make pancakes, waffles, shortcakes, biscuits and pizza crust. It also is great as a coating for baked chicken. It's made of rice flour, sugar, leavening and modified potato starch. One fan advised that adding flaxseed meal and dried cranberries to the batter makes a superdelicious pancake. We tried it, and she was right. We also made waffles that came out crisp, light and delicious. One-third cup of mix has 140 calories, 0.5 grams of fat and less than 1 gram of fiber.

Collins submitted more complete written answers, but we're not sure how committed he is to the views he expressed. Asked by members of the Editorial Board, for example, what he would do to shore up the Social Security trust fund, he talked generally about the importance of the program and about possibly allowing Americans to personally invest their own Social Security contributions. We had to remind him that he had proposed two different solutions - raising the age of eligibility and reducing benefits for wealthier people - on his questionnaire.

Murray neglects this research in his book. Meanwhile, his left-wing critics in the blogosphere have reverted to crude 1970s economic determinism: It's all the fault of lost jobs. People who talk about behavior are blaming the victim. Anybody who talks about social norms is really saying that the poor are lazy.
So even though he was still performing occasionally with the Dark Brothers, Vocaturo enlisted his old friend Dan Smith to work on some demos for those leftover tunes. “Once the Dark Brothers ended for good, I knew that I wanted to keep doing something with music,” Vocaturo adds. “So one thing led to another and it all evolved into this band.”

Did you know that retail eggs can be up to 6 months old when you buy them at the supermarket? As long as they aren't washed, removing the natural oil that appears on the shell, or refrigerated, they can be held a long time. The date stamped on the end of the cartons? That refers to the time the eggs were processed and placed in the carton. Our eggs reach the consumer within a few days of being laid. My eggs don't have storage problems because folks eat them so fast.

Although the deals were quickly overshadowed by the Blazers firing of coach Nate McMillan, they netted something that could become valuable this off-season: draft picks. The pick from New Jersey is considered particularly valuable as it is top-three protected. That means if New Jersey gets one of the top three picks in the draft lottery, it would keep the pick this season. Otherwise, the Blazers would get it.

Manhattan: Last Saturday, April 21, was a sunny day. Gloomy skies were predicted but the sun shined in many ways! A great omen for Pan Can's Third Annual Purple Stride Walk in Riverside Park - raising funds to fight pancreatic cancer - the fourth largest cancer killer but the least-funded, with no early detection, limited treatment and no cure. Lisa Niemi was a ray of sunshine, kicking off the walk with her inspirational message. "I'm here for Team Patrick!" referring to her husband, Patrick Swayze, who succumbed to the disease in 2009. There was sunshine as we walked along the Hudson among the throngs in purple T-shirts. Pan Can did not exist 12 years ago, when my husband died just three months after diagnosis.There was no hope, no treatment and no one to turn to. Not so today, thanks to Pan Can. The brightest ray of sun that day was my friend Ruth, one of 21 survivors there. We need so many more like Ruth, and we can get them if we continue the push for advocacy and research funds.

The Race So Far: Finally, a genuine competition — and five inarguably terrific performances. But how do the odds stack up? Well, Portman won at SAG, BAFTA, and took the Golden Globes’ drama prize; Bening won in New York, and picked up the Golden Globes’ comedy/musical prize. (The L.A. scribblers, bless them, decided the best actress of the year was Hye-ja Kim, in “Mother.”) Everyone else is excellent, but so far unrewarded — and it’s likely that Lawrence is too young, and Williams’ work too emotionally and literally naked, for their candidacies to take off.

A week later, when the FDA learned a distributor was recalling 1.3 million of the syringes, the agency should have launched a thorough inspection, according to its operations manual.

The article also includes a reference recommending that the entire pension fund be indexed in an effort to reduce management fees (which Ms. Mossburg overstates by more than 50 percent) and guarantee an average investment return.

The elimination of these asset classes would reduce diversification, increase plan risk and lower expected returns.

Margo Timmins of Cowboy Junkies sang “Don’t Let It Bring You Down” with some gospel fervor — not enough to make it a full-blown gospel song, but enough to underscore the pleading in the lyrics.
"You write the best first book you can," he says. "If readers like the first book and connect with the characters, they'll be eager to come back for a second helping. The central characters have to be people the reader likes and wants to see more of."

It was Harvin, more than anyone, who epitomized the climate Meyer created. While former players say Harvin always was treated differently as a member of Meyer’s Circle of Trust, it was the beginning of his sophomore season—after he helped lead the Gators to the 2006 national title—that it became blatant. That's also when it began to contribute negatively toward team chemistry.

My early vibe is the Browns feel the best bang for their buck at No. 4 will be for a defensive player, or a trade down.
Since 2002, the trust has raised about $32 million and will distribute about $20 million, including this year's awards, to the state's cultural nonprofits and heritage organizations.

There have been some mixed signals so far about the success of the race. Organizers were never able to entice a title sponsor — a reflection, perhaps, of the bad economy and the uncertainty of an event in its first year — but ticket sales have been promising. The VIP tickets sold out this week, and the grandstand tickets — some 27,000 of them — nearly so.

Considering how much the city has put into this race, they need to be more forthcoming.
