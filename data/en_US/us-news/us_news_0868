One other factor worked to Obama's and McCain's benefit during the primary season -- a deepening distrust among voters of all ideological stripes toward the Washington political hierarchy. McCain first attempted to run as the candidate of his party's establishment and failed dismally in that effort. It was only after his near-death experience last year that he reverted to the role of outsider and underdog that he began his comeback. Obama's positioning was even more impressive, as he successfully recast Hillary Clinton's message of experience as the ultimate in conventional and traditional politics. Almost one year after the fact, it's still extraordinary to realize that the first plausible female candidate in our nation's history was dismissed as business as usual.

Sentiment for two of Broadway's departed eminences didn't translate into golden medallions. There were no awards for August Wilson's "Radio Golf," the last chapter in his 10-play cycle about the African American experience in the 20th century; he finished it shortly before his death in 2005. And the dearth of prizes for "Curtains," first seen last year at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, meant that lyricist Fred Ebb, who died in 2004, and librettist Peter Stone, who had died the previous year, received no posthumous Tony honors. Composer John Kander, Ebb's partner on hits such as "Cabaret" and "Chicago," completed the show with Rupert Holmes.

CARNEY: Again, as I just stated, the President is committed to working with Congress. We actually hope and expect that there will be many opportunities this year to achieve things with Congress on behalf of the American people, specifically to help grow the economy and create jobs. That would include extending the payroll tax cut as well as unemployment insurance for the full calendar year. It will include, we hope, taking up other measures of the American Jobs Act that did not pass but which have traditionally received bipartisan support.

The results way back then were similar to those we have all experienced — at least those of us who have ever used film. “One man,” Fisher recorded, “had purchased film for 100 exposures and had gone on a long and interesting trip through Europe, kodaking as he went. After the film had been returned, as the custom was then, to the factory and developed, the pictures turned out spotty and spoiled as a result of the deterioration of the film’s emulsion.”

Official sources confirmed that the non-guaranteed bonuses were a blend of a marketing agreement and a licensing agreement. In short, the Yankees and Rodriguez were entering into a joint effort that would pay Rodriguez for the use of his likeness and mandatory appearances as he approached agreed-upon "milestone" homers. There are reportedly five milestones: tying Willie Mays at 660, Ruth at 714, Aaron at 755, Barry Bonds at 762 and the homer that breaks Bonds' record.
Holland plans to head to Helsinki today and remain at the tournament, which is split between Helsinki and Stockholm, through the final May 20.

Just about every rationale offered for the peripheral canal  which would be the largest water project in the state since the Aqueduct was completed four decades ago  is hotly contested. Would a canal save endangered fish or finish them off? Create jobs or destroy them? Do the costs, estimated to reach $53 billion or more, outweigh the benefits or vice versa?

But if its three narrow lanes, wood rails, no shoulders and outdated appearance don't make a motorist nervous, especially in heavy traffic, then consider this telling observation from Bill Schnell, assistant district engineer for the Missouri Department of Transportation: "The bridge is still safe to drive across, but it is on life support. Of the 10,000 bridges in Missouri, replacing this one is the top priority."

Greens are some of the first foods that come to market. Try them unadorned with dressing; you may be amazed at the depth of flavor. I like to wash and spin them dry as soon as I get home from the market, then store them in zip-top plastic bags. I tuck in a paper towel to absorb moisture and press out as much air as possible when I close the bag. Stored this way, they can keep for at least a week.

And this year, like Dee Hart last year, athletes are starting to force the hands of college recruiters. And who can blame them. Recruits are the livelihood of NCAA coaches and their job security. When a coach making a million dollars a season wants to make an investment in his career, he wants to take out the guesswork.
Still, there is the question of political optics, which has annoyed even some liberal critics. Obama will be resting and recreating on an island associated with the wealthy (though not everyone there is) at a time when unemployment has remained at 9.1 percent and how the administration has handled economic issues remains the heart of U.S. politics and policy through 2012 and probably beyond.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein nicely summed up the GOP’s strange behavior to The New York Times: “This is part of a larger effort, candidly, to cut back on rights and services to women. We’ve seen it go from discussions on Roe v. Wade, to partial birth abortion, to contraception, to preventive services for women. This seems to be one more thing.”

The opera's plot was inspired by the failed real-life experiments of a lunatic Russian geneticist, Ilya Ivanov, who tried to cross-breed humans and apes. The prologue sets up the tale of the rise and fall of Orango, a.k.a. "Jean Or," a human-ape hybrid who becomes a virulent anti-communist and newspaper baron through a combination of sleazy journalism, stock exchange swindles and ruthless blackmail, before his corrupted humanity causes him to revert back to his bestial nature. He is then put in a cage and displayed as a cautionary tale.

This gives the Bears a more-than-solid defensive front anchored by Julius Peppers on one side and Mercilus – the burgeoning prospect out of Illinois – on the other. He may not be a right-away difference maker, but over time, in that scheme, he could be very dangerous. Look for the Bears to also be exploring a WR (Kendall Wright, Baylor).
Yet any seed fee, at its essence a voluntary sales tax on a specific group, remains a hard sell. Some fiscal conservatives don't like the idea of any new taxes. And some birders say seed, which can run from $10 to $40 for a 20-pound bag, is already too expensive.

øOf course, everyone knows intuitively that structures located near rivers are subject to flooding. But many area small businesses some distance away from the river never considered that they might need flood insurance. So, very few were prepared the day the rains came and the sewers backed up in several communities, causing flooding and destruction beyond belief.
By unfortunate comparison, the 26-story residential buildings at 5601 and 5701 Boulevard East in town currently provide 318 parking spaces at five lots, restricted to those building's residents. In order to park there, residents must obtain and display an Overlook Terrace vehicle sticker.

Women were leading forces in labor strikes that began in 2006 and became the seeds for the uprising that toppled Mubarak. They have choked on tear gas and died in the streets with men. The problem, women say, is extending the equality between the sexes that was so pointed in Tahrir Square to everyday public life, where the passions of revolution give way to the restrictions of culture and tradition.
The state pension code was revised in 1998 to make employees of statewide teachers unions eligible for inflated public pensions if they already had service credits in the plan — just like the Chicago-area labor leaders who benefited from city public pension funds.

Salads, the restaurant's bread-and-butter so to speak, are fantastic -- and huge. The Seattle Walnut ($9.49) -- grilled chicken, Granny Smith apples, gorgonzola, tomatoes, walnuts and dried cherries, topped with Tomaydo's own champagne vinaigrette -- was a flawless pairing of a sweet and savory.

In fact, few Ohio members of Congress felt the need to send out press releases to publicly denounce the bombing plot that was revealed on Tuesday.

Another highlight of our Funchal trip – rating right up there with swimming in the warm ocean – was taking the telefrico (sky cable car) from the heart of Funchal up to the village of Monte, which offers astounding views and – surprise! – a toboggan ride down steep streets. No, there's no snow; these toboggans have greased wooden runners and two guides whose thick boots help slow down the sleds for the sharp turns. The sleds travel a few kilometers, and riders can then take a taxi back up the hill or down to Funchal. For the not-so-adventurous, it's still worth the trip up to Monte – and the extra few euros to take the cable car back down.

Another was her recent arena concert tour, a conceptually ambitious production that presented not just a cavalcade of her hits and album tracks to tens of thousands of fans each night, but a show that took them inside the head, heart and imagination of a typical teenage girl, warts and all.

The surveys, which involved more than 1,200 companies, suggest that some businesses feel they will be better off dropping health insurance coverage once the exchanges start, even though they could face fines and tax headaches. The percentage of companies that are already saying they expect to do this surprised some experts, and if they follow through, it could start a trend that chips away at employer-sponsored health coverage, a long-standing pillar of the nation's health system.

Ignite's rooftop scene is on par with the upper decks at nearby hangouts like LoDo's and the Tavern Uptown. The difference, though, is size: Ignite is considerably smaller. The building is a modest two-story affair, not low-slung and sprawling, so the roof is just not as spacious. Ignite does a good job with what it has, though, including plenty of four-tops, some shaded high-boys and seating at the bar.
The bill passed in December in the then-Democratic-controlled House, but was blocked in the Senate by a 55-41 vote, with most Republicans and a few Democrats saying the measure would reward illegal behavior.

What kind of organization shuts down a whistleblower's claims, bankrupts him with a $1.2 million order and then can't find the testimony behind its damning decision?
At 3 1/2 hours, Martin Scorsese's bio-doc of the Quiet Beatle may seem like a lot, but it covers a whole life -- and it was a hell of a life. There are interviews with Harrison's brothers, wives, son and the surviving Beatles, oceans of never-before-seen footage, and deep insights into the man's musical and spiritual journeys. There are blemishes and contradictions on display: This is no hagiography. Scorsese, who did a similarly fine job on Bob Dylan in "No Direction Home," manages to make us see a familiar figure anew. Harrison was a saintly fellow of his stripe, and the obvious love and loss his friends feel at his absence is poignant. A lovely and, I dare say, definitive portrait.
“I wanted to call Jackie Leary,” Menino said yesterday. “He was the first person I thought about from the moment I heard about the crime. I wanted to pick up the phone and hear Jackie’s voice telling me what the situation was.”

The other thing that stood out to me is how the group mimicked the stats concerning future employment. The vast majority of survivors I met are unemployed or were doing volunteer work even if they had paid employment before their accidents. Although the largest group of TBI survivors is young adults in their prime working years, including many of today's returning soldiers, many survivors do not return to work. The ability to work is highly connected to the executive brain functions the survivor has left. This is one of the reasons high costs are associated with brain injuries and why some caregivers of the severely brain injured have a heavy load.

"GCB": Robert Harling, the writer of "Steel Magnolias," is the executive producer of this show featuring another group of colorful, opinionated Southern women and their Dallas community. Leslie Bibb plays Amanda, who was a teenage Mean Girl in her Dallas days but then moved away. The death of her husband forces Amanda to come back to Big D with her tail between her legs and move her kids in with her mother (played by Annie Potts). Amanda's re-entry into the community isn't going to be easy because the women she knew back when are carrying grudges, not to mention their own baggage. The debut episode is lively and funny, though it's as broad as a barn door when it comes to characterizing these women and their world. Kristin Chenoweth also stars. (10 p.m., ABC/2)
Some conservative reformers argue that No Child Left Behind established an "accountability framework" that's worth preserving. Trouble is, the federal law created incentives for states to dumb down rather than raise standards in order to reach that all-important 100 percent proficiency by 2014.

But they paid $3 million for a real estate consultant, the Staubach Co., to recommend a building. Then they paid $21.8 million to the Jacobs Group for Ameritrust. They later spent more than $10 million to rid the complex of asbestos and decided to demolish the tower, designed by noted modernist architect Marcel Breuer, claiming that the floor space was too small for suitable offices.
I was the beneficiary of having outstanding teachers from elementary throughout college and graduate school to the point where I'm still thinking about the things they taught me. I hope that as they've created in myself the desire to be a lifelong learner, I hope to instill in my students these same level of learning to hopefully supersede the level of instruction I was fortunate enough to receive from these teachers.

This was an idea that was supported by a strong majority of the American people -- including nearly half of Republicans. The majority of millionaires supported it. And Senate Republicans didn’t listen. They refused to even let it come up for a vote; refused to ask the wealthiest among us to do their fair share. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House just signaled their willingness to gut programs like this one that make a real difference in people’s lives -- thousands of middle-class families or folks who are trying to get into the middle class.

Fontbonne's softball team looks well on its way to a fourth straight 20-win season. The Griffins (12-6) have used an explosive offense to trigger much of their early-season success, led by the hot bats of freshmen Danielle Glixman (Parkway North) at .422 and Cassandra Glixman (Parkway North) at .396. Danielle Glixman is fourth on the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference batting list.

Yet it's the continuing nuclear crisis that especially haunts this man in his 60s. That's because he's a survivor of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima in the final stages of World War II. A buff, square-jawed fellow, Mokudai appears the picture of health. But he's endured cancer and other afflictions attributed to the Aug. 6, 1945, nuclear blast that instantly killed an estimated 90,000-120,000 people and caused the deaths of tens of thousands more.

He did say our rain is unconnected to El Niño or global warming or Icelandic volcanoes or a butterfly fluttering its wings in China.
Police and city officials maintain there is no gang problem and that identifying gang members -- who they say may or may not be active -- needlessly frightens the public. "We go after the criminals," said Elizabeth Police Chief Ronald Simon. "If they're selling drugs, if they're committing acts of violence, that is how they come in contact with us. That's how we react to them, that is how we arrest them. If they happen to be identified as gang members so be it."

After a shocking early exit in last year's NCAA Tournament, Baylor may be the most redemption-hungry team in this year's field and it clearly shows. Opponents have tried everything to slow down Brittney Griner — some almost mirroring a defense one might see against Dwight Howard and the Orlando Magic, with up to four defenders collapsing on the 6-8 center at once — but the Bears have comfortably sidestepped the field just like they have during an undefeated regular season. The one thing that the Cardinal may have going for them is the high rate at which they score. Coming into this game Stanford ranks fifth in scoring offense, buoyed by the fantastic Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who averaged 34 points, 9.5 rebounds and hit 67.6 percent from the field last weekend. Their best chance will be to turn this into a shootout.

Investigators would find a .22-caliber handgun in his backpack. It was a crucial find, since ballistic tests would later confirm that a weapon of the same caliber was used in the Jan. 26 murder of Phoenix cigar salesman Bruce Gaudet, whose body was found in his smoldering condo, and the Jan. 30 murders of philanthropists Lawrence and Glenna Shapiro, whose bodies also were found amid the remnants of an arson fire at their Paradise Valley home.

Greek voters made that point by electing a slew of splinter parties to parliament, challenging their leaders' ability to form a majority coalition that can govern effectively.
Busloads of demonstrators were arriving from Los Angeles and were expected to join large numbers of locals protesting the measure this morning. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio — whose campaign against illegal immigrants has made him a widely popular, if controversial, figure here — had said he would open a new section of his outdoor tent jail that he is dubbing "Section 1070," where he intended to house illegal immigrants detained as a result of the law.

As I noted in a pair of columns in 2010, we offer recommendations because we publish an opinion page. It seems inconsistent to publish positions on all kinds of issues and then punt on the most crucial questions citizens face  which candidates and ballot measure to support?
You just knew this was going to happen. During a recent Knicks’ front- office meeting/conference call with scouts, interim general manager Glen Grunwald thanked Isiah Thomas and Allan Houston for “making us aware of Jeremy Lin.”
"He's a terrific player," he said. "I love watching him play. He's got such a command of the game. He really does control the game in the fourth quarter and get guys involved. He's got great quickness. But I think everybody underestimates the strength that he plays with. He can take bumps and he can take hits and still finish at the basket. He's got a real, real bright future."
Twelve years later, knowing I cannot be trusted to get fit on my own, I have called on a personal trainer for the first time. The trainer's name is Christy Siebert, and she is based out of Life Time Fitness Beachwood. She did not come to me; I came to her based on a friend's recommendation. After a couple of phone calls and emails, I was convinced she would be the right person for the challenge. As a bonus, she owns a journalism degree from Ohio University.

The result is that the entire ranger corps is spread pretty thin, regardless of specialty. That's a big reason why the 5,000 or so volunteers who help out doing everything from riding the train to breaking and cleaning trails are so important.
Of all the inflammatory things R.C. Hoiles wrote and said in his 91 years, none aggravated people more than his words about government schools, known to most of the rest of the world as public schools. But, that was his strength – to challenge and present in a new light institutions that so many had come to take for granted, or even revere.
According to officials, next year’s plan brings staff levels to their lowest in 40 years.

In addition, 25 percent said they would have to cut back on their meeting expenses if they held an event in the region.
Gov. John Kasich, the Columbus zoo, and the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation support the measure, which would allow current owners to keep their animals by obtaining a new state-issued permit by 2014 and meeting other strict conditions. Facilities accredited by some national zoo groups would be exempt from the bill, along with sanctuaries and research institutions.
We also approached the woman who cuts their hair. I went in and said to people: My daughter had a melt down over ice cream because she wanted more. And, so I decided my children needed to meet people they didn't know and learn about their lives, so they can develop an appreciation for other people in their community as well as their own lives. The hair dresser said to us, "I always ask clients about them; no one asks about me." She was a single mom, divorced, raising three kids on her own. And that day was her daughter's birthday, and she was at work. I told my girls, I'm home with you guys on your birthdays. Do you see she can't even be with her daughter on her special day? They really got it.
I'm collaborating again with Mark Annen, who helped design Park Kitchen. To me the design highlight is the physical connection between the bar counter and the open kitchen. It emphasizes the close connection between the food and drinks we will be serving.

It didn't happen again after that night in 1982 but Hickson's abuse of Starr continued for years. He kept her off World Championship and Commonwealth Games squads, even though she was faster than members of the teams, because she refused his continued sexual advances.
Carp has only pitched six complete seasons as a Cardinal, so his standing on the franchise leaderboards isn't all that impressive. But in terms of impact, he's up there with the best. He's the only Cardinal pitcher in history to make starts in four different postseasons. He's one of only three to be the ace for two World Champions; the others are Bob Gibson and Mort Cooper. He's one of only four to have 1,000 or more strikeouts; the others are Gibson, Bob Forsch, and Dizzy Dean. He's the only Cardinal other than Gibson to win a Cy Young award (although, to be fair, Dean, Cooper, and Howie Pollet probably would have won it if the award had existed back when they pitched). And Carpenter is the only Cardinal ever to get at least one 1st-place vote in the Cy voting in three different seasons (2005, 2006, and 2009). Not even Gibson did that.
Wright was released with a pending court date.
Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, sounded increasingly optimistic.

Microsoft will make a $300 million investment in the company at a post-deal valuation of $1.7 billion in exchange for an approximately 17.6 percent equity stake, the companies said in a statement. Barnes & Noble will own approximately 83 percent of the new subsidiary, which will have an ongoing relationship with the company’s retail stores.
In case you missed it, a recommendation came out last month that physicians cut back on using 45 common tests and treatments.

In his tune-up start for Toledo on Saturday night, Smyly allowed three runs and exited in the second inning. He had thrown 50 pitches, and club officials might have decided that was plenty to get him ready for his debut Thursday against Tampa Bay.
A: Spare tires, even the compact temporary type, are disappearing from many cars and crossovers as manufacturers try to save weight, space and money. Lucky for you, though, full-size spares remain available on several SUVs.
Occupy St. Louis member Zach Chasnoff mentioned in his remarks on the steps in front of the Peabody Energy building that the corporation should return some of the tax breaks it has received, including $2 million from St. Louis Public Schools, so those funds can better benefit the city.
Barrett said Friday's incident wasn't the first time someone had mistaken a partner for a turkey and shot him twice.
The bar's cocktails are sophisticated - no gimmicky flavored vodkas here - and a portion of the menu is dedicated, fittingly, to variations on blood and sand. We tried the classic, aptly named Blood & Sand ($10; scotch, orange juice, sweet vermouth, cherry liqueur), a well-balanced cocktail that's citrusy and sweet with a gentle kick from the scotch and bitters. And the Bleeding Castro ($10; rum, spicy-sweet vermouth, orange juice, grapefruit juice, cherry liqueur, bitters) was much more potent but still smooth.
The amici briefs question why the trial-court jury was allowed to hear the problematic identification of Lawson as the shooter by Sherl Hilde, the victim's widow, who was critically injured in the brutal late-night sniper incident at Briggs Camp.

But as we soon find, there's still a huge question looming: reinvent Atlantic City as WHAT exactly? A more family friendly destination? Or Sin City east?
Though Adamek has fought 45 times in his career — and, after a unanimous decision victory against Kevin McBride (35-9-1), won 44 of those fights — he has done so as a heavyweight just six times.
Even though Esther had wed in secret, her father later threw the customary party at home. Her family begged Esther to delay her departure, she was so young, this was so sudden. And while Larry was polite and shy, her father worried. Esther simply said she was Larry's wife now. She would cross an ocean and a continent to be with him.
Police did not comment on whether the attack was random or whether items were stolen from the shop.
Cain was perfect the first time through the order, throwing just 28 pitches. But the Marlins struck in the fourth when Jose Reyes walked, stole second, took third on a wild pitch and strolled home on Hanley Ramirez's single through a drawn-in infield.
Ohio, however, has only five Democrats in its current 18-member House delegation. And Kucinich is easily one of Ohio's most liberal elected officials.

"I see it as a once-a-decade kind of company," said Bo Brustkern, founder of Denver-based Arcstone Partners. Using Google as a model, Brustkern estimates that Facebook will hit $12 billion in revenues next year and is worth $137 billion, based on its ability to dominate and redefine the way marketers reach people online.
Scott was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1992 when that city erupted into violence after a jury acquitted four L.A. police officers -- three white and one Hispanic -- accused in the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. Scott recalls walking out of The Forum on April 29 after a playoff game and into the "chaos."
The 22-year-old certainly didn't damage his case against the A's, allowing just one run on a pair of singles and two walks, striking out seven. He's now 8-5 with a 2.58 ERA. Those are pretty good numbers for anybody, let alone a youngster in his first big league tour.
State Republican Chairman Jay Webber wished the 86-year-old Senator a "speedy recovery."
"All those guys like to play some type of transition basketball," he said. "But I like to attack and be in attack mode. Maybe even push it in terms of pace and tempo than those guys in my coaching family."
"I think that Romney people are misusing Newt's former colleagues," says Walker. "What they are saying is either a distortion or a deception, in most cases. It certainly does not reflect probably the most successful speakership in modern history."
With the new bar, I'm thinking they might need to tweak the name. Maybe the Wilde Roast Cafe & Bar? "I hadn't really thought about that," Schlaak said. "But I suppose we should add something so we can get the word out."
Greg Cote, Miami Herald: "I'm not sure what will be worse to see: Seattle's hideous home uniforms or a pathetic Rams offense that could be down to third-string QB Tom Brandstater because of injuries to Sam Bradford and A.J. Feeley that kept this game mercifully off the gambling sheets. St. Lose is 1-5 on the road, and Seattle has had extra time to prepare after playing last Thursday and has won 12 of past 13 in this series."

In other words, those involved have done a great disservice to their colleagues — men and women who are willing to take a bullet for the president, the first family and others they’re sworn to protect. Their behavior also evoked the issue of human trafficking and its intimate link to prostitution — which is why the State Department prohibits its employees from patronizing prostitutes even in countries, like Colombia, where it is legal.

The ruling Wednesday by judges in Strasbourg clears the way for a fresh U.K. deportation hearing for Abu Qatada, who has been described in both Spanish and British courts as a leading al-Qaida figure in Europe, effectively handing the case back to British authorities.
It’s hard to appreciate his particular craft, but it was easy to notice that this guy did his job as well as anyone during the annihilation of Atlanta. Most of us tend to think his world spins on power, distance and hang time, but the finesse and accuracy Weatherford demonstrated Sunday completely locked up the Falcons’ return game, and coach Tom Coughlin made a point of noticing.
A year ago, Twins right-hander Matt Capps made him look beaten on an inside fastball. A year later, the 37-year-old Jeter is making fools of those who try.

The alliance contacted about 300 former patients from American hospitals throughout 2006 and parts of 2007. The number was higher for larger hospitals.

That's the finding of a survey released last month by Attain Fertility, a national network of 40 fertility centers.
There are still people out there who believe the Social Security trust fund contains economic assets that can be used to pay for benefit checks. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, for example, says no action on Social Security is needed until two decades from now. If so, why was it necessary for Treasury to transfer cash to Social Security to cover its costs? Why didn't the feds simply dip into the trust fund, stashed with $2.6 trillion in Treasury bonds?

A diplomat who worked both sides of the aisle, Udall finessed the Wilderness Act by invoking not the social programs of FDR but the national park initiatives of Teddy Roosevelt. He shrewdly drew attention to the growth of the Sierra Club and the popular awareness of the environment that had been sparked by Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" and, to a lesser extent, his own Wallace Stegner-inspired "The Quiet Crisis," about the history of America's environmental movement. The legislation, coupled with other laws, has made the Udall years at Interior the historical high-water mark for preservation and conservation. The Wilderness Act, said one ardent supporter, turned poetry into policy.
"When Lily met my mother, she picked up certain Norwegian Christmas traditions, such as the potato-pancake thing called lefse, a jellied pork-and-veal thing called sylte, and various kinds of Christmas cookies, including something my mother called Chinese chews," said Charles Fillmore, a retired Cal linguistics professor who, like his wife, still lectures, writes and does research.

It was down 6 percent nationally and 5 percent in Central Indiana, according to WorkplaceDynamics' latest workplace survey. Fortunately, it's not the leading factor for being a top workplace.
Like the team itself, West is playing some of his best basketball of the season of late.
"The nice part is, if they have a bad period, they're able to regroup quickly, We don't have to go through the dance where maybe it's a week where he's a poor player. Maybe it's a period, and they jump right back. I like that in them, the fact that they respond that way."

That percentage exceeds the national forecast of 2.66 percent growth and also points the way to Ohio's strongest holiday season since 2007.
It may sound modest, but plant Superintendent Mike Henderson calls the hirings a "significant pickup." The plant's 50 employees produce thin layers of veneer, which are trucked to Medford and pressed together to make plywood and beams used in housing and other construction. No one is calling it a boom, but a slow rebound from the recession may be unfolding in the decimated wood products industry. That's why the company replaced the retired workers and approved the new hires.

Brown, 55, went to Omaha specifically to speak out against an anti-discrimination ordinance that extends rights to gay, lesbian and transgender people. This was part of his three-minute speech that's available on YouTube: The question I have for all of you, like Pontius Pilate, what are you going to do with Jesus? Ultimately, if you don't have a relationship with him, and you don't really have a Bible-believing mentality, really, anything goes. At the end of the day, it matters what God thinks most.
Obama, addressing the National Governors Association, said he supports a move to let states design their own health care systems starting in 2014 with waivers from provisions of his 2010 Affordable Care Act, so long as those state systems meet the law's goals.

"Apple's earnings really highlight that we're in a globally integrated economy, and large multinational firms like Apple can really access consumer growth around the world," said Erik Ristuben, CIO at Russell Investments, which manages about $140 billion in assets. Mr. Ristuben said earnings, while less dramatic than in previous quarters, were becoming steadier, giving investors confidence to push the market's valuation higher.
And it's the home to a mysterious black-leafed, white-veined plant growing in a forest near the high school. This undocumented flora attracts an outsider: "Professor" Paulie Panther, a participatory botanist whose job is updating "an encyclopedia of the hallucinogenic effects of North American plantlife." Panther is, quite simply, one of the great messed-up antiheros of recent fiction, at once a man on a mission and the most chemically addled weirdo this side of Hunter S. Thompson. (With his sideburns and intense scowl, he actually looks more the way the late Harvey Pekar sometimes did in his "American Splendor" comics.) The first of many laugh-out-loud moments for me came during the prelude: An incredulous motel manager asks why he needs a receipt, to which Panther — cigarette smoke blooming, mirror shards stuck in his forehead, blood flowing down his face — responds: "I'm here on business."
Plain Dealer news researcher JoEllen Corrigan contributed to this story.
The reaction among New Jersey federal representatives and environmental groups was swift to the Obama administration's plan to open up the Atlantic Ocean to oil exploration and offshore drilling — which stands to include points on the Virginia coast and near Cape May in the Delaware Bay.
He's from Texas. He moved to Cleveland in March. Something to do with tequila? Nope. Venzor came to Cleveland thinking he was going to attend law school. That is, until he ditched it for another kind of bar -- one in which he serves chocolate-based drinks. "I don't know many people here or much about Cleveland," says Venzor. He also can't speak about the drinks at Chocolate Bar. Not because he doesn't know much about them. "I'm sworn not to divulge the recipes," he says. "They're a secret."
He said he was surprised the court let the CityNorth agreement stand, "but I understand that with two decades of confusion, overturning it could have opened a Pandora's box" of challenges.
I'd say, lots of luck on that one . . . with most places, but not here.
One can easily understand why some of us have decided to literally "occupy" various entities.
The Magic of Belle Isle
I wrote a note about this back in April for the Sunday feature, Hot Corner:
Jay Hancock's recent column regarding speed camera was simply shameful (Welcome to Md., becoming known as the 'Speed Trap State,'" Dec. 13). So we enforce our laws — big deal. So he and the poor man from out-of-state were fined for exceeding the speed limit (by more than a few miles per hour). There is an easy way to avoid that: Obey the law. Drive at the appropriate and safe speed. (I'm glad Mr. Hancock briefly mentioned the almost forgotten point that the speed limits exist for safety.)
Running to unseat Rush in the March 20 primary are Raymond M.

His jaw seems to chew his repetitive wheedling demands, half-formed ideas and excuses like a cud. His wide eyes are forever roving and retreating, baffled by the clutter, in their attempts to find something to use for his advantage.

Aficionados of more traditional history will be equally familiar with the events of the Spanish-American War, including the sinking of the Maine and George Dewey's destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila as well as the U.S. annexation of Cuba and the Philippines.

Much of the crowd, eager for the “Slippery When Wet” hits, waited patiently through the mid-tempo ballad – one which has sometimes been compared to “November Rain.” But those in the audience who’d seen Bon Jovi before knew they’d been given a special treat. The group was up to the challenge, and Sambora’s solo on “Dry County” was scalding.
