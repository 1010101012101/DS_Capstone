So yeah. Can the Blazers duplicate this? Hold up. Do they really want to? Because as much as I loved the comeback, and the moment in which Roy wiped his tears as he came off the court, I would not like Portland to duplicate its sad first half, or that blasted third quarter.
Through his college roommate, Mack is acquainted with Maja, has dined with her (and lusted after her) on business trips to the West Coast. At her funeral he meets Zoltan, "all bone and beak," looking "like a large predatory bird." After the funeral, Mack invites Zoltan to dinner, and following the sumptuous meal during which Mack reveals his insecurities, Zoltan spies an opportunity. By evening's end, they've made a deal: Zoltan will move in with the McKays in New Jersey and finish his novel in splendid isolation, and in return, he'll teach them "the art of living." Back at home when Mack proposes the arrangement, Heather is titillated, both by her husband's "gutsy risk" that promises to aerate their lackluster marriage, and by the prospect of being "the apex of this beguiling triangle."

The exception, of course, is Kahlo, whose hauntingly graphic, rawly confessional self-portraits were embraced by feminist scholars and spawned a global cult of Frida-mania decades after her death in 1954. But Kahlo's singular prominence has been a mixed blessing for her female contemporaries. "She did contribute to get attention of women artists overall," Arcq said. "But at the same time it does overshadow a lot of them."

Sharapova is one of the few women at Flushing Meadows who won’t back down against Serena. A perfect 11-0 in three-set matches this season, Sharapova could make a run at her second U.S. Open title (she won in 2006). She got a big boost by winning the hard-court tuneup in Mason, Ohio, earlier this month. And her Grand Slam results this season — she reached the semis at the French and the final at Wimbledon — have been encouraging. As long as her serve holds up, she should be in good shape.

Elaborate arms, some slinky sidling and partnering of the sort where one dancer manipulates another - in a repeated motif, the men caught hold of a partner's ankle, stopping her in a precarious balance - gave "Symphonic Dances" a possibly unintended predatory overtone. It's a kind of style that can easily veer toward acrobatic and away from the organic, although Yuan Yuan Tan and Vito Mazzeo dug through the intricacies of their duet to elicit a wistful longing.

* St. Louisan Adrian Clayborn ended up in a great spot, Tampa Bay with the 20th pick. The Bucs are on the verge of being something special. Last season their defensive line was torn apart by injuries; 11 different players had 100 snaps on the Tampa Bay D-line. And too many D-linemen played at a subpar level. So Clayborn not only figures to contribute immediately, but he should be an important part of a winning team for many years.
Rivera went down about an hour before the game, his foot giving way in the warning-track dirt. On the ground, he grabbed at the knee and grimaced. Girardi quickly raced out to him and, with bullpen coach Mike Harkey, lifted Rivera into the back of a cart that whisked him off the field.

"I think these are Spanish napkins," Gonzalo, my Bilbao-born companion, says in disbelief. It's almost too ridiculous to think that anyone would import such a shoddy implement from halfway around the world. But the owner of this restaurant tracked down these servietas, priced them out, shipped them in, and stacked them up in custom metal dispensers, all because, in one frustrating wipe, they re-create the experience of consuming tapas in a packed barroom in Spain. Whether or not the diners appreciate this is beside the point.

ABOUT THE DEVILS: New Jersey made its share of mistakes in Game 1, but head coach Peter DeBoer was still upbeat about his team's performance. "I think we deserved to be in the hockey game," he said. "We dominated the first period and could have had two or three goals. They took over the second and the third was relatively even." The Devils will almost certainly need more out of skilled winger Ilya Kovalchuk, who was held without a shot in the opener and gave the puck away more than once in the loss. Kovalchuk answered questions after the game, but bolted after being asked if he was healthy.

Their interest was first reported Wednesday night by Charlie Casserly of the NFL Network.
He cites an initiative from Waldo Jaquith, who pondered creating an "impractical-from-scratch" cheeseburger: "Tomatoes are in season in the late summer. Lettuce is in season in spring and fall. Large mammals are slaughtered in early winter. The process of making such a burger would take nearly a year, and would inherently involve omitting some core cheeseburger ingredients. It would be wildly expensive ..."

Jake Watters is a typical teenager who loves listening to music, playing video games and annoying his parents. But he also faces a health challenge that used to only be seen in much older people.
I've been happy with Mexican clethra (Clethra pringlei), a low-care evergreen that's 20 feet tall and 4 to 5 feet wide. It produces cinnamon-scented, creamy-white summer blooms. 'Maki' podocarpus is a 10-foot Japanese yew that's about 3 feet wide. Taller cultivars could be trimmed for slimness.
A century ago, Sacramento's bustling Japan Town centered around Fourth and M streets, but withered when Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps during World War II. After they returned, downtown redevelopment in the 1950s displaced many of Japan Town's residents and businesses due to eminent domain.
Hillman played just two seasons with the Aztecs but was incredibly productive, rushing for 3,243 yards and 36 touchdowns.
"It's a sound investigative technique to interview the victim first, if possible," says Dean Andrews, the police department's deputy chief of detectives. "The detectives at the time were told Koschman was going to be in a medically induced coma for five days. It's reasonable to believe that the detectives did not think this was going to turn into a fatality."
In Arlington, Gingrich mocked Romney for saying he can't tell Restore Our Future to halt its ads because campaign laws require candidates and PACs to operate independently of each other. If Romney publicly announced his desire to see the ads stop, Gingrich said, those airing them probably would hear of it.
The Hall was a treat Sunday afternoon, a nice break in what could have been a long day waiting for that 8 p.m. local time first pitch. Not the Bruce devotee that Bernie and so many of my friends are -- I'm truly jealous of their passion, to be candid -- the Rock Hall had other treasures that caught my eye. Most were the handwritten lyrics and scribblings of the musicians. It was amazing to see a normal piece of paper transcended by what is written on it -- the lyrics to "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," for example. Or, a few cases over there was another sheet of paper with what was probably "Hey Jules" written at the top, vigorously scribbled out, and replaced with the far more familiar "Hey Jude". Some issues of the newspaper John Lennon wrote as a school boy were also there, to my delight.
Luz Sarmina, president of strategic initiatives for non-profit Valle del Sol, said she's nervously awaiting the decision.

"Once they are inspected, they have to be sealed up" in either a box or bag that can be closed, said Michael L. Maguire, a plant protection and quarantine officer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Hilo, Hawaii. Gardenia and jade vines harbor pests and cannot be taken out of Hawaii, he added.
Maybe the Cubs will surprise everybody.
For the first time, Staton acknowledged that the massive ground search for Kyron found no trace of the boy - despite searching some areas four separate times. As many as 1,200 people assisted in the search around the school and the Horman home for Kyron in the days following his disappearance.
2. Oh, Miami: Surely everyone is sick of all the psychoanalysis, perusing of stats, questioning of heart, etc., etc., about the Miami Heat, who lost their fifth game in a row last night, this one to the Blazers (who were seriously short-changed of credit for the win).
So this is a family that knows life is no breakaway, and that if you are lucky enough, if you believe enough, triumph sometimes has a chance to overcome tragedy, and maybe you can even get to cheer your son as he chases a Stanley Cup with the New York Rangers.
Robin Bragg of Beavercreek also came to remember those killed in the attacks. Wearing a T-shirt that said, "Pray for our troops," he walked around the statue, reading the names of the dead.
Once, she recalled, a parent insisted her child "needed a list of what they were supposed to do that day, every day. I said, that's not something I'm going to be able to do." Instead, she advised the parents to hire another student to help the child. They did -- and after a semester, the extra help was no longer needed.
Yura acknowledged a "lack of clarity" and "confusion" within PG&E's own standards governing what kind of measuring equipment should be used in spike tests and how it should be calibrated.

But it feels peculiarly nice inside. It's a little happy green room with a big window into the kitchen; everything smells clean and fresh. There's a weirdly adorable ultra-green polka dot theme. The door to the kitchen bears the sign, "Don't mess with the Hawthorne PD." Everything about the room is lovingly immaculate, in that carefully tended, homemade way that only tiny family restaurants can truly achieve. Then, rising up out of the quiet, the smell of chicken on the grill creeps out of the kitchen.
Holy tension. Throughout the entire episode. You'd think Megan's parents visiting would cause the ultimately fight-turned-rough-sex session for Megan and Don, but it actually brings them together.
Medical equipment maker Steris, which employs roughly 1,000 people in Mentor, will spend $8 million on its parts-production facility.

But moquecas don't steal the entire show at this seafood hideaway. An appetizer of scallops in their shells baked under a fine mist of Parmesan brought "mmmm's" and "ooh's" and "aah's." Small moquecas or moquequinhas of mussels or cubed shark are easily shared among a crowd. Equally shareable, frito misto, expertly fried and precisely arranged crisp fish, calamari and shrimp, make a fine textural contrast for the stews — and an excellent absorbent for the excesses of too many caipirinhas.
Besides generating electricity, landfill gas can be used as a substitute fuel in manufacturing or industrial plants or be upgraded to pipeline quality gas.
For some money managers, German car makers fit the bill. Volkswagen, for instance, sold a record 8 million cars last year, vaulting to the No. 2 spot worldwide, behind General Motors.

Congressional investigators argue that Holder’s staff was briefed on the existence of the operation three times before then. Justice officials say the attorney general was not made aware of the details, particularly of the fact that guns were being allowed to cross the border.
Through his former spokesman, Mr. Meek declined to comment. Spokesman Mahen Gunaratna said employees worked "long hours for relatively modest pay compared to their private-sector counterparts. As such, our office was able to extend a modest severance."

Carlsbad is 25 miles south of San Clemente and can be reached by Interstate 5. I prefer to get off the freeway in Oceanside and enter town via Historic Highway 101, which becomes Carlsbad Boulevard. It's possible to go by train, taking Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner from Orange County stations to Oceanside. From there, transfer to the Coaster train, which has two stops in Carlsbad.

The Heat drew within five early in the third quarter, but the Celtics continually had answers. At one point, Rivers tried to sub for Garnett, and Garnett waved off his coach, clearly engrossed in the playoff-like intensity.
Lev Gudkov, head of Levada, also sees a political dimension. "The worst thing is that people who could have played a key role in the modernization campaign proclaimed by the Kremlin are all leaving," Gudkov said. "But it appears that the Kremlin couldn't care less if the most talented, the most active Russians are emigrating, because their exodus lifts the social and political tension in the country and weakens the opposition."
Brewers basher. Troy Tulowitzki went 6-for-13 with a double, homer, three RBIs and a stolen base in the series at Miller Park in Milwaukee. Tulo is batting .402 (45-for-112) with 12 doubles, eight home runs and 24 RBIs in his career against the Brewers.

Smiths three-run shot came in the third inning. He tagged the first pitch he saw from starter Troy Marks and sent it over the left field fence, driving in John Tommasini and Joey Matthews.
Talk about a buzz kill. The geeks live for this stuff. But for casual fans, the moment the talk turns into formulas about elevation gradations and tailwinds, eyes glaze over.
Regarding your editorial about Rick Santorum's views on the environment and Catholic teaching, it's a bad idea to invoke any of the imaginary gods to legitimize environmental protection, because there are so many of them ("Phony theology," Feb. 21).
But De Rouen is doing a great job executing it; while the food itself may seem limited in ambition and lacking a personal stamp, almost every dish I've had under her tenure has had a bright polish.

At a minimum, the Pentagon should be addressing this inequitable matter of multiple deployments to combat zones.

Provisional and some absentee ballots still will be counted. In August, when the same levy proposal was defeated, it picked up a net of 42 votes between the unofficial count on election night and the official tally a couple of weeks later. When it lost in May, it picked up a net of 40 votes after election day.
"It's just a knack for the ball. I mean, my hand on it, I tried to tap it in, tap it off the backboard, then when I tapped it the second time I knew it was going to come off, so I tapped it into the rim to try to tap it and then the next thing you know, it came off to the left side so I just said I'm going to grab it.
"I'll never take it off again," she said. "I figure this ring is good luck."
Having sold their 10,000-square-foot custom home (Dorie called it "the Beast") mostly furnished, the empty nesters brought little with them. They promptly converted the garage into a guesthouse, moved into it and went to work.

It is not entirely accurate that winning 51 games, amassing 109 points and finishing first in the Eastern Conference meant “squat.” The people who invest an inordinate amount of time, energy, emotion and money to go to the games — the fans, that is — deserve to be repaid with the honest effort the Rangers provided throughout the year.

The project began in the summer of 2010, when Rodrigo Corral, a book designer who has created covers for Junot Diaz, Jeffrey Eugenides and Jay-Z, began to toy with the idea of a visual novel that used images, rather than words, to tell the story. He approached Ben Schrank, president and publisher of Razorbill, a Penguin young-adult imprint, who liked the idea of a novel that could be spun into an interactive, multimedia app. They brought in novelist Jessica Anthony, author of the quirky 2009 novel "The Convalescent," about a dwarf who sells meat out of a bus. The pair got to work on a story. Ms. Anthony came up with a plot about a beautiful young piano prodigy who falls in love with her next-door neighbor, suffers a mental breakdown and obsesses about him when she's sent to a "rest facility."

U.S. Attorney for Colorado John Walsh has said he sent the letters because he's worried about the impact medical marijuana is having on kids and said he is serious about clearing dispensaries out from near schools.

Faced with the prospect that the Rangers could be playing their final home game of what has been a special season, the Madison Square Garden crowd replaced pure panic with total euphoria when Richards and Staal packed a huge one-two punch.
Two-up is relatively simple to play. Two coins are placed tails up and marked with a white cross. They are placed on a kip—a small, flat piece of wood with a handle—and sent spinning into the air. Players bet on whether the coins will both fall heads up or tails up, and the winner takes all.

But the retail earnings results show that rising prices for gas and food, particularly meat, dairy and produce, have started to erode spending power.
The next time I hear a talking point on how gas prices have doubled under the current president, my head just might explode. Gas prices plummeted in the weeks leading up to the Obama inauguration because the worldwide economy was in a free fall.
Some of these ideas are being promoted by this administration. I was dismayed at some of the things done in the D.C. school system, by putting a moratorium on charter schools. I think that was a huge mistake. But I will be a president who promotes the principles that I have seen work in my state.
It may be that the only way the Academy can push itself toward diversity is to make some changes to its rules. It's not a matter of lowering standards. Not every longtime member would get in under the newer restrictions, and not every more recently accepted member fulfilled all the current requirements. Last year, before she even appeared in her Oscar-nominated role in "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," Rooney Mara was accepted into the acting branch with just two relatively significant film credits instead of the Academy's mandated three. It's a matter of being flexible and aggressive.

Creffield ministered to a number of women, not always with the approval of their husbands or fathers. Creffield would hit the road when the atmosphere in Corvallis turned unpleasant, but eventually he couldn't run far enough. He was in Seattle in May 1906 when an Oregon millworker named George Mitchell, whose sisters had submitted to Creffield's ministrations, shot him in the back of the head.
Aided by eclectic archival footage, the film recalls the history of poker from its early gunslinger and riverboat-gambler days to its role as a welcome time-passer for World War II soldiers.

Yes, you could drive that far on the parallel Santa Monica Freeway in less than half the time it takes on the Expo Line, assuming there was no traffic. You could also flap your arms and fly to the moon, assuming your arms were equipped with retro rockets. The 10 is one of the busiest freeways in the United States, and it's only going to get worse. The train goes to USC, Staples Center and Exposition Park, and it connects to rail lines running to Long Beach, Pasadena or North Hollywood. Its completion makes L.A.'s rail network start to feel almost, well, functional.

The Dragons opened the season and lost five of their first nine games. They would win their last 12 including the Class 2 state championship game against Smithville. St. Mary's finished the year a robust 20-6-3 and took home the fourth state championship in its decorated history.
But when she sings "I Miss The Mountains" as she flushes her medicine down the toilet, the show loses its bearings. Yorkey and Kitt probably intended this tender salute to the "good" side of manic-depressive illness to capture a feeling that real patients express, but they've dressed it up as a wistful love song. This kind of romanticism colors the show's view of medical practice (bad!) and of mental illness (explainable!). Too simple and less than honest, romance undercuts the real strength of "Next to Normal," its frank look at the devastating toll mental illness exacts on families.

Hmmm. Perhaps Jacob Weisberg and other devotees of state power, far from actually thinking libertarianism is dead, recognize that it offers the most cogent critique and set of policy prescriptions related to the current crisis.

Head Start: Federally funded pre-kindergarten schooling for children in low-income households
1. These workers already took a 10-12% pay cut to help the city deal with recent budget troubles (our librarians took 12%). We find it offensive when such a large sacrifice is consistently ignored in conversations that are, at the end of the day, about our members. Our members also make commitments (such as buying houses at inflated values) based upon what they expect their take home pay to be in the future, just like everyone else. No doubt, few have planned for the drastic pay cuts we now face.
Slaten said he has no plans to change his hard-hitting, sometimes personal style that some find offensive but others see as a refreshing alternative to mainstream sports-talk radio that Slaten often terms as 'sucking up'' to the home teams.

Questions abound about I'll Have Another (12-1), who beat Creative Cause only by a nose in the Santa Anita Derby. Was Creative Cause just sorting out the equipment? Is I'll Have Another on the way up the ladder? Do you think a horse named for a response to cookies can win the most prestigious race in America? Suit yourself.
But little has changed nationally since the report was released. A Utah state senator introduced a bill to make the high school senior year optional in 2010 as a way to balance the state budget. But other than getting a slew of national media attention, it gained no support.

The teams likely won’t make a profit by hosting the game, but stand to benefit from hosting the league’s showcase event in other ways: advertising dollars, accelerated seat sales since suiteholders would receive an allotment of Super Bowl tickets, and possibly an expedited title sponsor as happened for Miami’s Sun Life Stadium before hosting the Super Bowl earlier this year.

It's easy to start a series, of course, but a lot harder to sustain it, so we'll see if Mix @ the Max has legs. The Knights performance is an enticing maiden voyage, though drawing a crowd on a Monday night (and the day after Easter) could be tough. For this concert, a mix of cabaret-style table seating and traditional concert seating will allow room for 300 in the Music Box.

Explain the "you can catch more flies with honey" concept, and suggest she tone down her pitch. Admirable causes don't need to be shouted; their points can generally be made logically, smartly. Loud and annoying haranguing doesn't work.

It will certainly be a statement game for the Terps as they look to get back in the Top 25 and eventually the NCAA tournament.

A gallon of premium grade paint costs more than it did last year. Why? Think pigment.
One of the thoughts behind Blue Morel was to make it more approachable price-wise than Copeland. You can still spend plenty at a place offering a $44 grass-fed beef strip loin and a $15 jumbo shrimp cocktail. However, at the other end of the scale there are several choices, including the black pepper fettucine with pancetta ($23) and sherried eggplant ($17). Takafuji pickles it, adding some honey and bok choy for a sweet treat.
If you've been slacking on saving for retirement -- or haven't started saving at all -- forget about prepayments. Figure out how much you'll need to save for retirement here and then use your spare cash to get there by saving through a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401(k) or Roth IRA. Ideally you should aim to save 10% of your gross annual income -- though my print colleague Jonathan Clements would argue that daunting figure is still too low.

A bill that has already been introduced in the Minnesota House would allow 4,000 slot machines to be installed at Canterbury Park and Running Aces. According to the Equine Development Coalition of Minnesota, a horse racing advocacy group, racino money could add $25.9 million to the tracks' purse funds by 2015. Thoroughbred purses would increase from $5.5 million to $22.5 million, with purses for standardbreds and quarter horses rising by a similar percentage.
So for seniors on the go, here are a few sample food swaps for breakfast, lunch and dinner, picked from a fast food joint, a restaurant and the supermarket. Of course, if your daily diet really looks like this, no food swap will save you; but if (like most human beings) you do eat out every now and then, and have the occasional convenience meal for dinner when you haven't got the time or motivation to cook your own, making these choices will save you a total of 1,350 calories -- enough to keep a certain slightly paunchy middle-aged man jogging along the Mississippi River Boulevard for miles.

He is tremendously missed by his family, neighbors, and the hundreds of patients he entertained and befriended at the Copper Ridge Alzheimer’s care facility.
There's a thought out there that Michigan State showed how to beat the Buckeyes, by attacking but not doubling Sullinger, wearing him out, banging him with big bodies and forcing perimeter players to make shots. Maybe. There's a thought that the Buckeyes were exposed against an MSU team now tied for first in the Big Ten, unveiling cracks in the OSU foundation. Maybe.
Here's the thing. I realize movies aren't real, but while watching the movie, I can suspend reality at any cost. Caught up in the story, I find it sheer fun.
Steve Faulkner, an ODOT spokesman at the main office, issued a statement that said Director Wray was not aware of Meyer's son being hired before being contacted by The Plain Dealer, nor is he aware of any rule or law that would prohibit it. Ohio ethics laws prohibit officials from directly hiring family members or using the authority of their position to land jobs for family members. The ethics laws wouldn't stop Meyer and his son from both working for the state as long as the elder Meyer didn't have any influence over the decision.

The best of the entrees are very straightforward things, like a crispy beer-battered fish and chips and the meat loaf wrapped in bacon. Both are well-prepared and thoroughly satisfying. The fish is crispy outside, white, warm and flaky inside. The meat loaf, served with plain green beans and mashed potatoes — no funny stuff here — is well-seasoned and filling.

The '96 season was a banner offensive season for the Orioles in which five players hit 25 home runs or more, and — anyway — since there was no steroid testing in baseball until after he retired in 2002, he thinks his post-'96 drop in home runs actually proves that he wasn't doing anything illegal that year.

Under a blazingly hot sun, on a raised dais in front of the high school, a variety of legendary performers from the 1960s sang musical tributes to the group. Among the guests was Bobby Lewis, who sang "Tossin' and Turnin,'" which was No. 1 on the Billboard charts for seven weeks in 1961.

"I think it was just a matter of time before he won," McIlroy said. "It seems like this tournament produces first-time winners — Anthony Kim, myself, now Rickie. It's great to see. He probably has went through a little bit of scrutiny and a lot of pressure trying to get that first win. But now that win is out of the way. Hopefully, that will ease the pressure a little bit."

What makes this even more maddening is that you are a frequent guest. The A-Club should have been empowered to fix this problem on your behalf instead of passing you off to the main help line. But even when it did send you to another department, the reservationists with whom you spoke should have been able to see your status and to fix the problem - even if it meant they would have to place several calls to the hotel.

Today’s MBA schools focus on teams that solve business problems or situations — often for actual companies.
Chipper Jones was more than just Atlanta's veteran leader and the best switch-hitter of his generation. He was the Braves' compass, annually leading the way to the playoffs. With Jones out for the season due to a knee injury and the Philadelphia Phillies set to mount a charge on their division lead, the Braves looked vulnerable. Then they pulled a waiver miracle. GM Frank Wren landed first baseman Derrek Lee from the Cubs. The former All-Star agreed to the deal and made his Braves debut Friday at, of all places, Wrigley Field. The Braves needed a third baseman, but what they got was a first baseman with that same seasoned bearing of their fallen leader. Wren has furiously tinkered with his roster over the past month, adding Kyle Farnsworth, gambling on Rick Ankiel and then, the coup de grace, snaring Lee. More than smelling a postseason berth, Wren knows he may never have another chance to have a team like this. Manager Bobby Cox is retiring at the end of the season. October is the farewell gift he deserves.

By the time he was 4 or 5, Clowes was drawing little comics on the cardboard that the dry cleaner wrapped around his father's shirts.

Davina’s complaint specifically takes issue with a portion of Elsner’s draft of the ballot title that lists examples of what actions cannot be taken without specific voter approval. According to the examples, as written by Elsner, the city can’t work with local, state or federal officials on transit projects, which could include using city facilities like the library to host meetings or have staff attend them or pay for any transit studies required of projects. It also says the city can’t pay for staff or officials to use public transit.

Policymakers also could increase the amount of wages that are subject to Social Security taxes. Social Security is financed by a 6.2 percent tax on the first $110,100 in workers' wages.

In that regard, “The Pain and the Itch” resembles Yasmina Reza’s “God of Carnage,” which just completed a hit run at Artists Repertory Theatre. Both Reza and Norris take great comic relish in laying bare a universal human inclination toward self-interest, competitiveness, and hypocrisy. Reza seems to extol this brute individualism as unchangeable truth, as the great slayer of useless social niceties (which is why, despite great skill and vitality in Artists Rep’s production, the play still felt tedious and shallow).

So it's unusual to find a produce item that's known simply by a number: 1015. There's a story behind that number, though, and it revolves around Leonard Pike, from Texas A&M. Pike was on a mission to put Texas back on the produce map when he developed the spring sweet onion, but he's a man who likes to keep things simple for farmers. So he developed the 1015Y and 1015R. The letter represents the color -- yellow or red -- and the numbers are the date the onions are planted, Oct. 15.

It was all in fun, just the usual good-natured razzing that's part of the baseball culture. La Russa watched the game in the press box, and was into the game, writing down a lot of notes. Anyway, around the seventh inning, with Kyle Lohse making a bid for a no-hitter, Hummel approached La Russa and said: "You would have pulled him after the fourth inning."

Thole understands what he is being asked to accomplish. In 2011, his 16 passed balls were the most of any catcher in baseball. The Mets ERA with Thole behind the plate was 4.28. Among National League catchers who appeared in 100 games or more, only the Cubs Geovany Soto had a higher catcher’s ERA. While that statistic is flawed, and certainly a reflection of the quality of the Mets and Cubs pitching staffs, Geren is hoping a new and improved Thole will lead to better results from the mound.

The nuns, they keep to themselves. They work quietly, faithfully in the background, the humble and resolute handmaidens to the patriarchy. If we imagine them at all, we imagine them smacking schoolchildren's wrists with rulers. We imagine them as the Mother Theresa types, ministering to the sick and the infirm, changing the bloody bandages on the soldiers in WWII. We imagine them helping out the Von Trapps.
As long as NCAA investigators continue to unearth evidence that rules were flouted, the short-term future of the school's most prized athletic program is in question.

Amadee's sports cartoons could be bitingly satirical or blatantly gee-whiz, but they always hit their mark. Baseball, with its easy-going, mellow pace, matches Amadee's personality, and it is his favorite sport and subject. He is a fixture in the Busch Stadium press box and has been a member of the Baseball Writer's Association of America for 40 years. In 1968, his cartoons on the Cardinals were credited with inspiring the 'El Birdo 'craze in St. Louis.

“I came in hoping to get second. That’s where I was seeded. I just found that I had a lot more in me, so I just started kicking,” said Heydrick, who plans to run outdoor this spring instead of play lacrosse. “I ran a 4:37 before, I’ve been PRing every meet, but I was like ‘Tim runs a 4:25, I’m out of his league,’ but I just went out there and made it happen … I was in fourth with two laps to go, and then on the last lap, just passed Tim and went from there.”
Lula is happy with the calm, isolated life she has led for the last two years with Mr. Stanley and Zeke. She has been through a lot — the death of both parents in a less-than-heroic flight from war-torn Kosovo, a trail of stories through her childhood that careens around alcoholism, poverty, communism and government brutality. Mr. Stanley and Don encourage her to write her stories down. When she tries, a strange mix of lies, folk tales, plagiarized story lines from Albania's most famous writer, Ismail Kadare, and the truth emerges. It seems good enough for her American audience (Mr. Stanley and Don).

Although Leroy got all but two of the Cleveland touchdowns, it was by no means a one-man show on the lake front.

Tapas, Spain's delicious appetizers, are popular between a 3 o'clock lunch and 10 o'clock dinner. We stopped at cafes, sipped our wine, beer, or coffee, and ate delicious jamón, or ham. We were very conscious of how relaxed the Sevillans were around us. We were on an extended vacation, but this was their life. I absorbed these moments because I knew when I got home, I would have to "grow up," graduate, and find a job. And corporate America does not allow three-hour lunches or two-hour coffee breaks.
Washington was a defensive standout during his nine-year NBA career, a player who always guarded the opponent's best offensive frontcourt player -- bruisers like Moses Malone and Darryl Dawkins. Washington was twice named to the NBA's all-defensive second team and played in the 1980 All-Star Game when he was with the Blazers. But his career was, and always will be, overshadowed by the punch he delivered to Tomjanovich during an altercation between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets in 1977, when Washington played for the Lakers.
“It really didn’t do much for a while. And then a radio station in Chicago played it, and the rest is history,” Stevens said.
Though the department's mind-set has evolved in some ways, Rice said, many people on the ground don't notice a difference.

The department's ethos is still "You keep certain neighborhoods safe, you keep certain neighborhoods contained," she said.

The donors and their money underscore how Walker's reputation has spread throughout conservative circles after he pushed through legislation last year stripping most public union workers of nearly all their bargaining rights.

Where and how to place the shuttlecocks was the next order of business. Careful to avoid the symmetry and precision of the building, they settled on three shuttlecocks on the south side and a fourth on the north side of the building. The lone Shuttlecock No. 1 that sits perched on the tippy-toes of two feathers was a point of contention. The artists originally had it evenly distributed on its feathers like a tepee, but — as with the museum itself — they deemed it too static.

Already, CISPA’s current definition of what constitutes cyber-threat information has been altered so that it no longer places the broad and contentious term “intellectual property” under the legislation’s purview. The initial inclusion of intellectual property brought immediate comparisons to SOPA, a bill focused on curbing online piracy and digital rights protections, which was canned after extensive backlash from individuals and from websites such as Wikipedia, Reddit and Google, which held blackouts or hosted prominent notifications to help end the legislation.

"We played very few three-game matches," Senter said. "If we'd go out and lose the first one, we didn't always fight hard to try and get back into it and force a third game.

Ms. Rawlings-Blake has sought to deal with the problem through her "Vacants to Value" program, which is supposed to streamline the sale of city-owned property and to increase code enforcement on vacant properties in the hope that stiff fines will persuade their owners to fix them up or sell them.

Elizabeth, who has been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, needs regular counseling and medical care, and Scheibner has health issues of her own.

Other opponents believe safe ground will only enable the homeless lifestyle, which  like no-questions-asked shelters and soup kitchens  perpetuates addiction and sloth. To them I say, think of safe ground as self protection. If Sacramento creates a legally sanctioned campground, with toilet facilities and a Dumpster, the homeless don't have to trash the American River Parkway or sleep in alleys behind homes.

Under the leadership of Chairman Jon Leibowitz, the Federal Trade Commission has taken what few dispute is a firm stance on the issue of digital privacy.

In late March, the FTC issued its long-awaited final privacy report, laying out standards that could begin to define the personal boundaries of the digital age.
The dishes weave in some classic preparations and references, and some whimsical touches such as "coffee and doughnuts," which aren't on the menu but have become so famous they end up on most tables anyway.
