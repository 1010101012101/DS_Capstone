If Oregon is to achieve the goal that at least 40 percent of adult Oregonians hold a bachelor's degree or higher by 2025, our institutions of higher education must commit to bringing the highest quality of education to our citizens effectively and affordably.

They have strong allies in Oregon's regionally accredited, non-profit institutions of higher education.

As you would expect, the Aulani puts a heavy premium on family -- or ohana -- even if it is sometimes contrived. At first, I turned up my nose at the Rainbow Reef, a man-made, 8-foot-deep snorkeling lagoon filled with more than 1,000 tropical fish and mounds of coral. "Why go artificial when the real thing can be found all over the island?" I grumbled.

Because Adequate Yearly Progress involves scores earned in math and reading only, the outcome is not expected to impact whether the school keeps its AYP status. Science tests also do not affect a district's standing with the state, which uses math and reading scores to rate school districts.
Klaus, whose original plan was to save Elena and leave town with her so he can have her blood handy for creating his hybrids, learns about this and decides to drain Elena of her blood, killing both her and Alaric.

Other states, led by Maryland, disagree. In a friend-of-the-court brief, 13 mostly Democratic-controlled states and territories argue the law complements efforts to boost health access.

Try being Buchanan. Iguodala missed, and a Blazers fan reached down out of the stands to pat Buchanan on the back with, "You're doing such a good job!" If Iguodala's shot is true, the Blazers are headed to overtime and maybe Buchanan ends up a bum.

"I'm not suggesting that the ... case is moot, but you did wait for some three years before you brought this suit," Justice Anthony Kennedy said. "The building was built."
In the Democrats' debate Tuesday, the focus on foreign-policy issues gave Clinton a chance to bring up what many people believe was the high point of her eight years as first lady -- her speech at the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. In it, she castigated China over its treatment of women, arguing that women's rights could no longer be considered separate from human rights. The Chinese government blocked the speech from being heard within China.

That's not hard to understand. The Browns were an institution in Cleveland for a long time and their absence created a gaping hole in the area's sports legacy. LeBron is an individual player who was the most popular athlete in town for seven years. He'll certainly be missed, but at least he didn't take the rest of the franchise with him, so Modell probably won't be off the hook for long.
And over time, enough gets distributed throughout animal herds to foster the evolution of bacteria strains that are resistant to treatment with the antibiotics.

This year, the city will spend about $533,000 to clean those neighborhoods, plus Northwest Portland. The leaf depots are gone, a casualty of citywide budget cutbacks. That will save taxpayers $145,000 -- but leave residents with one less option for cleaning up.

And so The Best Man becomes a funny and engaging play about ideas. "This is exactly the kind of thing I got into politics to stop," Larroquette's Russell says - so what's a good guy to do? Jump into the mud along with his opponent or be trounced by a smear?
“I don’t anticipate knowing that dollar amount until there is some large agreement reached on tax issues, KPERS issues, some of the big issues,” he said. “Inevitably, the things that matter most are the things that are held to last simply because nobody wants to compromise on what they believe they need.”

Under Behm, 30, a Talula's and Django alum (also Gayle, Southwark, and Cafe Estelle), every morsel was memorable. Translucent rounds of shaved raw turnip sandwiched dabs of apple butter in the delicate crunch of ravioli. A cool lobster-mushroom terrine set over a warm potato cake, dusted with shavings of Burgundy truffles and Brussels sprouts, was an ethereal gulp of earth and sea. There were tiny snails over barley risotto touched with garlic and chive. A dilled tartare of steelhead trout and apples was refreshing against the soft-scrambled warmth of Lancaster eggs topped with the salty pop of trout roe. Tender smoked rib eye leaned Southwestern over cheddary polenta and vivid poblano puree.
And there's no one way to produce them. Some are handwritten. Some are audio- or videotaped. Some, says Boyer, become entire books, such as Elizabeth Edwards' "Resilience: Reflections on the Burdens and Gifts of Facing Life's Adversities."
And I was right. But since then, Adams has wandered off the ranch. She seems more interested in hyper-politicizing issues than actually getting things done.
Bob Lukasik produced this musical for Chatham Players 33 years ago, this time he’s producing “Cabaret” that has been revised and updated to be even more intense, more timely, more relevant and truthful to its time. “We are mounting a production that is honest, engaging and far from trite.

Three more couples up for recap from last night. Gladys was listening when the judges talked about her frame the previous week and was trying hard to improve it. I love that. I think Tristan is delighted to have a happier partner this year. Now, they show Jaleel and his "Mickey Mouse" breakdown again. I'm still not sure what was going on there. William's footage from last night shows Bruno reacting with "Oh my God" — and then we find out, through the miracle of slow motion replay that it was most likely a reaction to Cheryl almost falling completely on her tush after a move through William's legs. William hollers about the 10 from Bruno, "I LOVE YOU, BRUNO!" and then Cheryl unbuttons his shirt again. Cheryl is a smart, smart woman.

He's as particular about baking pans as he is about his grill. "When I'm cooking at friends' houses, I miss my pans. I don't have fancy pans, but they're sized right. My cornbread bakes best in a square pan. Too big a pan, it comes out thin. I'll make do with kitchen tools, like using a tumbler for a rolling pin or working with an unfamiliar knife, but you've got to have the right-size pan to get consistent results."

Unfortunately, curb extensions will be located to support the bike lane master plan, not necessarily supporting stormwater management needs. This action made clear the underlying intent: tap stormwater fees to fund bike improvements. Decisions regarding the location and design of stormwater improvements should be made based on the requirements of and benefits to the stormwater system. Political objectives should not override sound engineering management of the city's water and sewer infrastructure.
City officials responded that, in order to get state funding to improve school facilities, the state’s scoring process for awarding funds places a higher priority on new construction projects over renovating historic buildings.

Every year, Ohio State fans seem to think it's still Bo vs. Woody in "The Game." The Wolverines, however, were 1-9 on the field in the Tressel era, they are 0-7 on the field vs. OSU since 2003, and they wore clown shoes and light-up noses under Rich Rodriguez. Maybe that will change with new coach Brady Hoke.

Less literal was z'roa, the roasted lamb bone that symbolizes the paschal lamb itself. Lamb-y infusions were out; instead they considered the tradition of paschal blood, and ultimately settled on a version of St. Charles Punch, a deep crimson Louisiana-inspired cocktail from 19th century bar maven Jerry Thomas, with viscosity from some gum syrup. (Inspiration came, if you can believe it, from a visit to the phlebotomist.)

"I think people see through his game to put the blame on Europeans — I think Germans and Europeans still know where the economic crisis had its beginning," Braml said.

In a delightfully random change of course, we meet three rats, done in stop-motion animation (this is Portland, after all, a stop-motion animation haven). They discuss their strategy for getting into this zero-packaging paradise, the Fred-voiced rat recalls a brief encounter with one of those boogeying rodents from the KIA commercials, and then Fred Rat leaps into the store via a heating vent. He gets swept out before he can gorge on unpackaged foodstuffs. And that's it for our visit with the Portland animated rat population.
Which city is the notable exception? Washington. Just like New York or Philadelphia, Washington's job market depends on interstate travel; it also has highways, bridges, overpasses, underpasses and a substantial highway infrastructure that carries thousands of people to their places of work every day. The only thing D.C. lacks is a major bridge or tunnel. That shouldn't stop the state of Maryland from collecting tolls to maintain the infrastructure that leads to the city. It's time this commuter haven was tapped; Maryland residents of the D.C. area need to start to pay their fair share.

Let me explain. Nian gao sticks not only to one's ribs, but to the roof, tongue, teeth and walls -- in short, everything in the mouth.

Breast cancer strikes regardless of political persuasion or personal feelings regarding abortion. and abortion is only a small part of Planned Parenthood's contribution to women's health.

Not only does President Obama pale in comparison to King, but does he really think that Jesus sanctions his anti-life policies of contraception, homosexuality and abortion? Does he really believe that the murder of innocent children through abortion is good for the economy? Whose economy? On top of that, he has the twisted audacity to suggest those who oppose his anti-life policies are chattels to a "phony religiosity." Citizens, don't be fooled again!

Well, we also need to create that opportunity for people to rise, and I believe manufacturing is the key to that. People say, well, why do you treat manufacturing different, and I do. I don't cut the corporate rate for manufacturing to 17.5%. We eliminate the corporate tax for manufacturers. There will be no tax. Period. We create the opportunity for us to compete. So you say, well, why do you treat it differently? Because you here in Detroit have to compete against companies all around the world who want your jobs and in many cases took your jobs. And so we need to have a plan in place in America that understands the competitive playing field that you're on. We're not gonna move the bank overseas. We're not gonna move the retailer overseas. All of those other folks compete internally, by and large, but you don't. No manufacturer really competes internally or just internally. You compete with a world that wants what you have because they know that manufacturing, making things, is the key to wealth creation in any society.
David Uhlmann, an environmental law professor at the University of Michigan, said Tuesday that obstruction of justice charges were appropriate when there was destruction of evidence during a criminal investigation.

In other words, the definition of overweight or obesity -- and all the health consequences that research has attached to those definitions -- rests on a numerical calculation that only loosely approximates how “fat” an individual is.

Most of the settlements are with investors that had purchased mortgages or mortgage backed securities. They want banks to buy back mortgages that had misinformation about qualifications of borrowers who received them.

-� 2007 Kumeu River Sauvignon Blanc, Kumeu, New Zealand ($19-$23) - I picked up this wine a couple of months ago and today noticed that it is a 2007. That would be on the older side for a lot of Sauvignon Blancs but this winery makes excellent wine and I had high hopes. When I opened it, there were qualities of an aged wine but it was still very, very nice. The color has some deeper ring-gold tone to it, while still being light. The aroma has caramelized grapefruit and corn husk. The taste has a chalky/stony quality with roundness from the aging and a little smoke in the finish. 89 points

St. Joseph's officials, who began investigating Midei's records after receiving a complaint in April last year, say they quickly sent letters to patients alerting them of the investigation's findings so they could contact their doctors.

Some folks consider rockabilly one of the earliest styles of rock 'n' roll.

The Stray Cats brought the sound to the MTV generation of the '80s, and today there's a new group of bands carrying on the tradition.

Really, this rap on Romney seems a bit unfair. Among an American electorate whose waistlines are expanding as fast as CEO salaries, relaxed-fit jeans have become ubiquitous. Romney may simply be trying to bond with the schlubs he hopes will vote for him by sporting the same saggy pants. But Mitt lacks the pendulous middle-American gut. As a result, he has to pull up his jeans and cinch them tight, thus giving himself that peculiar “mom” look.

But then she introduced the pesky element of water. Right. That's when the problems began. When we got the actual windsurfing thingie out on the water, well, that introduced a slipperiness I had not counted on. And that slipperiness introduced my butt into the water on several occasions. When it wasn't unceremoniously dumping me into lovely Lakes Bay, the sail was straining muscles I never would have considered necessary to windsurfing. Certainly the cool young guys flying up on a breeze barely hanging on to their sails didn't seem to have screaming hamstrings. (For goodness' sakes, even John Kerry can do this windsurfing thing!) My quad muscles, already burning from a particularly intense kickboxing lesson of the day before, burned, protested and, eventually, made me lose my balance so that the mast smacked my shin and dumped me backwards into the bay.
