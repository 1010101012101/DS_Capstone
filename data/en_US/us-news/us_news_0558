In a handshake of commitment to stand for our principles—but to never abandon our duty to serve the people. We've shaken hands as a symbol for our citizens of all that is possible in a future that demands that who gets the credit finally takes a back seat to doing something worth getting credit for. Senator Sweeney and Speaker Oliver— that is my commitment to both of you.

Because entrepreneurs matter, public institutions across America have long tried to produce more of them through education and venture funding. The irony, though, is that these things only work when you already have entrepreneurs around. According to the Kauffman Foundation, entrepreneurship programs at universities have increased tenfold and venture capital funding twenty-fold since the 1970s, and yet the business formation rate in America has stayed the same. When you see a burgeoning startup culture in a particular city, it usually has more to do with entrepreneurs begetting more entrepreneurs than anything public institutions are doing.

Malley's, area locations, malleys.com: There are chocolate bunnies, then there are chocolate bunnies. Like the 17-inch Milk Billy Bunny, complete with chocolate candy-filled backpack. It's the tip of the candyberg at Malley's, which defines Easter candy for many generations in the area. In addition to the many, many chocolate bunnies, rabbits and crosses (for the more religiously inclined sweets lovers), Malley's also has some funkier selections, like chocolate-covered Peeps and Twinkies. But it's the signature filled nutmallow, peanut butter and caramel eggs, from 12-ounce cartons to 4-ounce mammoths that keep the fans coming back.

"The issue with concussions in general is that we're learning something new about their effects almost daily," Russo said. "We are literally in the middle of a paradigm shift. We have new information, new knowledge coming out and 10, 20, 25 years from now, we may see a very strong link between brain injury and suicidality. It's very hard to say brain injury leads to suicidality. We know there are higher rates, but it's like we're in the first stages of developing awareness."

The jaded Tidbit consumer will have guessed, correctly, that one does not get ultra-thinness for nothing. The package of regular provolone weighs 8 ounces; for the same price, the package of ultra-thin sliced provolone weighs 7.6 ounces, so ultra-thin slices cost 5 percent more per ounce (there should have been 21 slices).

And now comes word that Dale Dillon, the head of the group that was supposed to make the 2012 version not only well run but also financially solvent, may be on his way out. When the city signed its deal with the new promoters, Downforce Racing, Mr. Dillon's involvement was cited as a key reason we should have confidence that last year's troubles were behind us. He came with the strong recommendation of IndyCar officials, and his last-minute involvement in the 2011 race was seen as crucial to that event happening at all. But he is now evidently at odds with his two partners — neither of whom has experience in putting on car races — and appears to have been effectively out of the picture for some weeks now. This may be as good an indication as any that the 2012 race isn't going to work out.

Vegetable: Because the side dishes (kugel, potatoes) are likely to be baked, it's nice to have a freshly sauteed vegetable. Whether you're doing green beans, asparagus, broccoli or carrots, follow this scheme: Hours before the meal, parboil the vegetables in plenty of salted water and, when they're just tender, drain immediately and plunge into ice water. Keep changing the water until the vegetables are cool. Drain and pat them dry and refrigerate. Before you sit down to the seder, saute some garlic in a large skillet until it just starts to color. Take the vegetables out of the fridge so they can come to room temperature. When you're ready to serve, remove the garlic from the skillet, heat the oil and add the vegetables, tossing until they are hot and just starting to brown in spots.

With No. 5 hitter Berkman and cleanup hitter Holliday off to some of best starts of their careers - both are hitting better than .395 through May Day - the trio at the heart of the Cardinals' lineup has folks looking for a nickname. On a radio show I co-host Sunday morning on 101 ESPN/WXOS, a few listeners suggest hockey line-ready nicknames for the threesome: H-B-P (Holliday, Berkman, Pujols, of course) or AMP for Albert-Matt- Puma, in that order.

The Indians are really closer to the playoffs, particularly after the addition of an extra wild-card team, than their Cleveland rivals. But they generate less excitement than either. Despite the occasional splurges by the Dolan family -- Ubaldo Jimenez (Ouch!), Travis Hafner (Ow-wee! again), Asdrubal Cabrera and Carlos Santana (Let's wait and see, but have the iodine ready) -- the franchise is considered cheap in the court of public opinion.
Album of the Year is only one of four heavily contested Grammy categories. The other three are Best New Artist (often the kiss of death for a budding career), Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

I think city hall itself will be fine. 14th & broadway may be closed, & traffic a problem. I would only want her away from city hall so she does not on a whim decide to go walk in protest and engage in any way, as she may be apt to do.. (but that's a fear because she has historically been seen as pro demonstrator which in light of weeks press would exacerbate the problem perception)

The concerns over austerity are perhaps not surprising given the Netherlands has already fallen back into recession.
Scouting report: Earlier this season, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski called Sullinger the best player in the country, but it's possible Sullinger will be drafted lower than he would have had he come out after his freshman season. Although NBA executives love that he lost 20 pounds to get down to 265, and lowered his body fat from 16.7 percent to 12.1 percent this season, there are more bigs in the draft this year, whereas last year's lottery picks featured predominantly guards and international players. The Ohio State website refers to Sullinger as a "menace down low," referring to his soft touch around the basket. His biggest asset is his big butt, and he has learned how to use it to establish position and box out. Although foot and back injuries slowed him early, and the team suffered through a bit of a midseason lull, the Buckeyes playing on college's biggest stage in the Final Four gives Sullinger a chance to impress people all over again.

Through the generosity of several Lake Ridge families contributing to scholarship funds, the school was able to offer financial assistance to the girls.

I then test the ducts to see how leaky they are, and especially if they leak to the outside of the house. I usually spend the rest of the time, maybe another hour, tracking down answers to questions that came up. The last thing I do is get up in the attic and do a corner-to-corner inspection. People are usually happy to have me high-tail it back to my car at that point because, once you're up there, you're usually pretty grungy.
"Congressman Leonard Lance is fighting everyday to protect Social Security and Medicare. Leonard is a tax cutter, protecting the pocket books of senior citizens.

Seniors have to balance their budgets and so should our government. Representative Leonard Lance understands this about as well as anyone in Congress," said Chairman Martin.

NOTES: Pierce injured the knee during Sunday morning's shootaround and hurt it again when he tried to get around a screen set by Smith during Game 4 that night. Rivers became just the third coach in Celtics' history to record 50 postseason victories, joining Red Auerbach (90) and K.C. Jones (65). New England Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork was at the game. The Hawks lost to the Celtics in the first round of the 2008 playoffs, a series that went seven games. Boston went on to win its NBA-record 17th championship. Allen, the NBA's all-time three-point leader, was 1-for-7 from beyond the arc. The Hawks are 1-11 in playoff series against Boston.

Start with a salad course. Lettuces like endive and radicchio hold their own on a hot grill, caramelizing just enough to lose a little bit of their natural bitterness.

Jeff chastises them for having no strategy and being disorganized, before he tells them that Kourtney’s wrist is broken in several places.

"We want to go further," he said. "After tomorrow there's only 16 teams left in the whole country. So you're talking about pretty rare air. But I think if we continue getting better and we improve and we make progress, we'll have an opportunity to be successful once again."

As you might expect, spirited driving with the traction control in Normal mode reveals some light feathering of the brakes.

Still, Detroit -- both city government and the quasi-public Detroit Economic Growth Corp., which controls some of the more significant vacant spots, such as the Tiger Stadium site at Michigan and Trumbull -- has stuck to a policy of holding out for highest, best-use conversion of vacant land. Ideas for private ownership often get rejected because they don't meet those criteria -- both in terms of individual lots and bigger parcels.
The Cardinals aren't convinced. The franchise has seen the city's inability to seal a deal for the local hockey team.

Saute skillet. We did like Chantal's just-launched copper fusion 11-inch saute skillet with lid ($200 at Sign of the Bear Kitchenware in Sonoma). The Chantal folks have combined copper, for its good conductivity, and enamel, for easy cleanup. Chantal's enamel coating is chemical-free, according to the company. While the pan is heavier than the company's mainstay enamel-on-steel cookware, it regulates heat well and cooks evenly. Cleaning is a breeze, and its fire-engine red color is snazzy. But if red isn't your thing, it also comes in platinum.

With our easy access to great produce and limes going for a dime each, it's hard to justify buying bottled fruit mixers for mojitos, margaritas, lemon drops and screwdrivers. These hand juicers, sized for oranges, lemons and limes, make it easy to get the most liquid flavor out of the fruit without labor-intensive twisting and wringing or buying expensive machines that take up a lot of counter space. Just cut the fruit in half and squeeze the liquid directly into your drink.

And as the Army shrinks by 80,000 troops over the next five years, its top officer, Gen. Ray Odierno, is also seeking ways to ensure that the land force is prepared for a broader set of missions -- and in hot spots around the globe where few soldiers have deployed in the past.
Here's a look at how the day with play out:
Rose himself was the difference, with his repeated ankle-breakers for Lin or any defender, and with a laser mind-set that had him so furious at one moment early in the fourth quarter that he stopped play, with the ball, and screamed at a ref.
Lodi wines are all over the map, but with common themes. The all-over-the-map part has to do with the area's range of varietals. Cooler wine-growing regions typically focus on a handful of wines—Napa, for example, has become best known for its Cabernet Sauvignon. But warmer wine regions, including parts of Spain, Italy and the Rhone Valley in France, often grow and mix a number of varietals into quality blends.
The former state attorneys general — Robert Del Tufo, Deborah Poritz, John Farmer Jr., Peter Harvey and Zulima Farber, all of whom served between 1990 and 2006 — filed a friend-of-the-court brief in January that supported the New Jersey judge's ruling.

“The beauty of the people I thought was astounding. The color, the noise, the smell — everything about it is completely staggering. And I can’t wait to go back.”
"I am not really intertwined with the rest of this investigation," she said. "It is odd to see the judicial system from this perspective."
Sometimes, not always, he'd invite me in to see certain big products before he unveiled them to the world. He may have done the same with other journalists. We'd meet in a giant boardroom, with just a few of his aides present, and he'd insist—even in private—on covering the new gadgets with cloths and then uncovering them like the showman he was, a gleam in his eye and passion in his voice. We'd then often sit down for a long, long discussion of the present, the future, and industry gossip.

TRENTON — Nobody expected Republicans and Democrats to agree on how to reshape New Jersey’s 40 legislative districts, a process that could determine which party rules the Legislature for the next decade.
"Think about 6-9-12-15 years, long-term," he said. "As the expense grows to maintain the 'optimal class size' in ZCS system, how much flesh does the average resident of this community have to continue to feed this dragon as it grows and grows?"
57. Jayron Hosley, CB, Virginia Tech, 5-10, 178. Led the nation in interceptions as a sophomore with 10, and despite his size, plays with a physical edge and is a willing tackler.

And the return to New York City may finally restore Spider-Man's lost gaming luster. The past few games have been solid affairs, but frequently boxed-in levels limited each effort's appeal, routinely diminishing - often restraining - Spidey's web-swinging abilities. But developer Beenox, which has been working on Spider-Man games since 2005, now gets to put the wall-crawler back in an open world of limitless, often beautiful, possibilities.

Huntington has completed repaying its $1.4 billion loan to the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Lyons respects the argument that soul food is a sacred heritage not to be touched, but he doesn't agree with it. He won't argue with you if you insist on old-school tradition. Just be sure to return the favor: "Don't come back and tell me what I'm doing is wrong."

Other countries that have seen large drops in the adoption of foreign babies include Spain and France, which fell 48 percent and 14 percent, respectively, from 2004 to 2010. Canada remained the same and Italy actually saw a 21 percent increase during that period, according to Selman, who analyzed data from 23 countries that are primary receivers of adopted orphans.
"Washington women haven't cared about fashion," says Peggy Noonan, a bestselling author and former speechwriter for President Reagan. "They thought if you care about how you looked, it's evidence that you are unserious about policy and power." Noonan, 58, describes women during the era she lived there as, "small men with breasts."
Martin Zanotti, who helped draft the charter as then-mayor of Parma Heights, said the provision was meant to act as a check and balance.

There were widespread reports of passengers waiting on hold to fix ticketing problems. Many reported that they couldn't get through at all. Odd balances were showing up in frequent flier accounts.
It is not surprising, then, that he has chosen to surround himself with friends and family. The new version of the E Street Band is 17 musicians strong. Springsteen has called Clemons irreplaceable, and he surely believes that’s true, but that hasn’t stopped him from trying to fill the position. On this upcoming 51-date international tour, he’ll be supported by a five-piece horn section containing two saxophonists — longtime associate Ed Manion and Jake Clemons, Clarence’s nephew. Jake’s sound, as it turns out, is a reasonable facsimile of his uncle’s titanic wail — good enough to earn him standing ovations after solos on “Thunder Road” and “Land of Hope and Dreams.”
Gasoline prices continue to creep upward in New Jersey as the July 4th holiday approaches.
But not long after the series debuted in October 1960, Knotts stole the show. Griffith, who was meant to be the series' comic focus, shifted to playing straight man. The writers began beefing up Fife's role and creating episodes that depended on the sheriff rescuing Fife from his latest predicament. "Andy Griffith" was the most popular comedy on television during its first season, and never dropped from the Top 10 for the rest of its eight-year run.
And best of all, those home games will be played in a ballpark that remains among the finest places to watch baseball on the planet.

"It probably affects me some," said Alsup, his Mississippi upbringing still flavoring his words. "But, really, in most ways, no."
FEMA rejected the request last month, saying the damage was not severe enough. It found that 80 percent of homeowners affected were covered by insurance and said those who weren't could work with local and state governments to get assistance.

Because of those questions -- and because the retirement contribution depends on how many people join the new plan -- my guess is that my cop will try to tough it out and stay another three or four years under the current system. For each year he stays, his pension gets 4 percent sweeter. With less incentive to stay in the system, the librarian might switch.
Lots of over-the-counter medications such as Claritin and Benadryl relieve allergy symptoms by blocking histamine, a compound that triggers all of the hallmarks of an allergic reaction to pollen: runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes.

Great singers have a way of taking any song and making it uniquely their own. But it takes a truly gifted vocalist to co-opt the anthem of an entire nation.
This inflated rhetoric is often accompanied by bad science -- or, perhaps more precisely, inherently inexact science badly used. Opponents of a particular regulation tout inflated projections of the regulatory body count, more often than not financed by the affected industry. Ditto, by the way, for those on the other side.

"If you ever get to Kauai, go to Kapaia Stitchery just north of Lihue — it's a fabric shop that will make you a shirt from anything in the store and then mail it to you a few weeks later. Some of those shirts I've had for 10 years without any sign of them wearing out." —bevatron
All Aldridge did in his return -- which remained a game-time decision most of the day Saturday -- was to get 19 points, 10 rebounds and four assists.

"Whether it's two days or two weeks, you will experience the genius of Frank Lloyd Wright in a way that a typical tour cannot provide. Imagine watching the sun rising over the marsh and ushering in the morning light show as the clerestory patterns are projected onto the interior brick and cypress walls. Experience Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for how that average American family could live. Relax, slow down and let Wright's genius unfold before you in a manner that is not possible on a typical house tour. The brilliance of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision can only be experienced fully by living in one of his creations. There is something magical almost spiritual about being in a Wright space that leaves one transformed."

What should have happened: Georgia, the one-loss SEC champ, two-loss USC or maybe one-loss Iowa -- which finished No. 5 in the BCS standings but might have been chosen over USC by a selection committee -- would have had a shot. The real title game couldn't have been topped, though.

Mr. Hinton also told the panel in 2009 that "we took every measure we could" to address what had happened in relation to phone hacking and try to discover any other misconduct.
It wasnt bad basketball Thursday, because both teams played tough, in-your-face defense. It was just unwatchable basketball because there were no players out there capable of creating any entertaining offense. Remotes everywhere flipped to more compelling televised drama, like perhaps the congressional debate on C-SPAN on whether to serve corned beef or pastrami at the next lobbyist smoker.
And there's no denying that touch is a crucial information-gathering tool. Ask any mother who has ever placed a hand on a child's forehead to determine if his flushed face is caused by running outdoors, or by a fever.
Even the entrance to his speech was part of his schtick. The president walked off stage just before he took the podium with an alleged "hot mic," making fun of getting caught last month on an open microphone with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

A:The biggest challenge in finding mentors is time commitment. It's difficult. We're asking people to give up their most precious commodity, which is time. We ask for a commitment of one year, meeting two times a month for three to four hours. People need to hear about us a lot before they connect with what they want to do, so we try to raise awareness. We've partnered with companies and community groups.

As for Holmes, what could he say? He was brave enough to take the podium for four minutes, and said little worth repeating other than sharing his affection for Schottenheimer: “Right now? Let’s hope for the best,” he said, when asked if he had confidence in the offensive coordinator.
--RHP Matt Albers has emerged as Bobby Valentine's reliever of choice with men on base. Thanks to a 95 mph fastball and good sinker/slider combo, Albers has allowed just two of nine inherited runners to score while posting a 1.80 ERA in 10 innings. "The hitters are going to be aggressive in those situations and I use that to my advantage," Albers said.
Please. I'm a hot commodity right now. And "Trivia Newton-John" is going to continue its reign of dominance in the Baltimore quizzo scene. That's what we call it back home in Philly, by the way. (Just as a shout-out, though, Wharf Rat quizzo is totally the best.)

A game that featured dueling starters Tuesday hinged instead on two calls on the bases, neither of which went the Cardinals' way in the Chicago Cubs' 3-2 victory in 10 innings. The second contested call, which allowed Tony Campana to steal second base and reach scoring position for Alfonso Soriano's game-winning single, brought manager Mike Matheny from the dugout. His second argument of the game netted the first ejection of his managerial career.

"Christie is not arguing about dollars and cents. He’s saying they don’t owe anything, and he’s on unsound ground," said Martin Robins, a transportation expert at Rutgers University who was closely involved in planning the tunnel.

The killing has sparked a debate about racial profiling. So James posted a photo on his Twitter account (he has more than 4 million followers).

The qabili palau arrives. Mounded majestically on an oval platter, the heap of mahogany-colored basmati rice, stained with meat juice and great quantities of cardamom, hides tender chunks of braised young beef (rather than the lamb often used). Bright swirls of candied carrot shreds and plump cooked raisins lend color and a heady perfume. The creation recalls an Indian biryani or a Persian polo, yet it's distinctly a dish apart.

The group also offers several other music enrichment programs each year to over 225,000 county students from kindergarten through high school. For more information, visit www.philharmonicsociety.org.
Don't be put off by the idea of a "lounge." Level's home is a contemporary and comfortable brick-walls and wood-floors space on West Street with good, broad dimensions. A curved bar is toward the back, and just beyond it is an open kitchen. So many restaurants in Baltimore operate out of a former living space or industrial space, but Level's space works on a human scale, and you feel neither cramped nor overwhelmed in it.
Schatz said the proposal could set a precedent for other neighborhoods to target chain stores such as Whole Foods Market and Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market. "What's to stop this from being used in any community where a nonunion retailer is trying to get in?" she asked.
Huntsman, speaking for a little over 10 minutes, delivered a version of his stump speech, calling for an end to American military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan and term limits for Congress, among other proposals.

If you're in that category, golf doesn't need you. A couple of points in the TV ratings aren't worth pandering to the lowest common denominator of golf viewers -- the people not moved by the drama of the competition but merely the presence on the leader board of a guy with a great name and a magnificent past.

The Kings' financial constraints appear to be keeping them at Power Balance, even though they've pushed for a new arena for years. The city and NBA believe the Maloofs are wary of taking on the debt needed to finance their share of the downtown arena.
Count on payback: "Reciprocity is a part of every society," Cialdini says. A classic experiment from the 1970s found that people bought twice as many raffle tickets from a stranger if he first gave them a can of Coke — proof that even tiny favors can work to your advantage. Likewise, your buddy is more likely to help you move that couch if you've ever given him a ride to the airport.

Keith Scroggins, chief operating officer for the school system, said that renovations at the headquarters "are not out of the ordinary" when a new manager is hired. "The difference in this building is that we don't use capital funds, and have to squeeze departmental budgets to do renovations," he said.
"In the past, my dad was there with me and I was separated from the team," Vonn said. "Then Thomas was there, and I was off with him. This year, I was an integrated part of the team. We went to dinner together, we'd hang out or go shopping. I had never done those things with the girls before, and it made my skiing more fun."
In just four months, Thomas has blossomed into one of college football's most exciting players. Analysts rave about his speed and vision and his 1,497 all-purpose yards rank 13th in the nation. It all confirms what fellow running back Kenjon Barner thought after watching Thomas in fall practice: "There's no way that kid is redshirting."
Steve Chapman ("A little greasing of the wheels is good for a local economy," May 1) says that bribery in Mexico and other countries is business as usual. He then says that this isn't the way we do business in America. I agree.

Mega Millions' $290-million jackpot is up for grabs, and office workers across the country are no doubt pooling resources to buy a bunch of tickets. But how do you keep from getting swindled?
The reaction to the mural project has surprised the detention center staff. On NFL opening night, they expected few teens to choose the mural work over the football game.
A handful of South Florida cities and neighborhoods - including Bal Harbour, Coral Gables, Downtown Miami, Miami's Design District, and Hollywood - are trying to change that by targeting visitors directly with messages that, they hope, will help their destination stand out and attract tourist dollars. Some have been trumpeting the message for years, and others are launching aggressive campaigns.
The TSA, which screens about 2 million air passengers a day, began testing the full-body scanners in 2007, installed them more widely starting last year and accelerated their use after the failed plot last Christmas. If a screener spots something suspicious on a scan, which shows an outline of the unclothed body, or if a passenger prefers to skip the scan, the passenger must undergo a physical search that many passengers have found intrusive.
Toward the end of the alleged conspiracy, which authorities say occurred between August 2006 and December 2007, Mazzocchi complained about how much he donated to Booker, without getting big contracts in return.

So yes, on this night, any satisfaction Calipari had would be largely hidden. But there were subtle signs that it meant more to him than he was letting on. The enthusiastic way he hugged his coaches. The way he climbed the ladder and took a few extra moments to wave to the crowd before he cut down the nets. The way he grinned while One Shining Moment played on the Superdome big screens.
But AFF's lawyers wrote that the ad "will not identify the speaker in any way. Only those familiar with President Obama's voice will know that it is President Obama speaking."

Las Vegas was one of the hardest-hit parts of the country during the recession - the housing market crashed and the casino business dropped off sharply. And many of Furman's clients are in the area. She now gets more short-term projects than she did before the recession, which means her income is less predictable. Last year turned out to be better than expected - revenue was down only slightly from 2010. But she estimates that first-quarter revenue this year was down 13 percent from a year earlier.
It’s unlikely that Brookman will get any prison time because she has no prior convictions, Judge Stuart Peim said, but she faces community service and probation when she is sentenced May 11.
Horman, dressed in a black jacket, skirt and heels and wearing what appeared to be a wedding ring on her left hand, entered the Multnomah County Courthouse through a back door and was escorted in a private elevator to the fifth-floor courtroom.
4. ACE HIGH: For the first time in his career, Adam Wainwright won 20 games and for the second time in two years he was outdone for the Cy Young Award. He did not, however, leave the season empty-handed. Wainwright's second-place finish in the NL vote triggered a $21-million, two-year option at the end of his contract. If he finishes this season healthy (i.e., not on the DL), the Cardinals will have themselves a bargain for 2012 and 2013. In 100+ starts since July 2007, Wainwright's 2.68 ERA is better than any other starter in the majors, besting Roy Halladay, Tim Lincecum and Felix Hernandez. He is arguably the best pitcher in the division, and 2011 likely marks the year he arrives, as Carpenter suggested in 2010, as the Cardinals' ace.
That was 1968.

Trumpeter Chris Botti is the rare jazz artist who is better known to pop fans, thanks to his million-selling albums and work with Sting, Paul Simon and many others. But Botti and his talented bandmates have jazz chops to spare, and will stretch out and show their stuff in a three-week residency (which began last night) at the Blue Note at 131 W. Third St., New York. Botti, drummer Billy Kilson, guitarist Mark Whitfield, bassist Robert Hurst and pianist Billy Childs play with extraordinary intuition, thanks to the more than 250 nights they spend together on the bandstand every year.
Role: The Blazers handed Mills their 15th and final roster spot Monday after waiving the rights to Jeff Pendergraph. Mills is a lightning quick, accurate long-range shooting point guard, who likes to push the pace. But, like last season, he probably will not be counted on for big minutes. Mills played in just 10 games in 2009-10.
For all you stat sacks, let me give you a number: 1,626. This figure represents how many hits were accumulated by the mighty McGwire, last seen bulging Incredible Hulk-like out of the garb of the St. Louis Cardinals, during his entire career, a sum that seems Reese Witherspoon slim next to some. If I may illustrate my point, McGwire's all-time hit count is lower than those of Eric Karros, Juan Pierre or Andruw Jones. So whether he was on a steady steroid diet or nothing stronger than a can of Red Bull, that is not a whole lot of hits.
He said the collection appeals to a younger demographic, but it's also flexible.

Robert Andino, who flourished in Roberts' absence, was at second base with the starters throughout the Orioles first full workout of the spring. The team has other options, including newcomers Ryan Flaherty, Matt Antonelli and returner Ryan Adams, there as well.
Scientists and health advocates slammed a new state report that concludes residents of St. Charles County are not at higher risk of developing leukemia due to radioactive waste stored at Weldon Spring.
I have no idea whether they cringe, but it's become really ubiquitous. It used to be sort of a New York thing that you'd always want to get it wholesale, but now because of the internet you can do all kinds of price comparisons and (there are) all kinds of ways you can get into sample sales and check things on Gilt and eBay. I think everyone now is comparison shopping and people are thinking, why should I be the only person in the world paying full retail price for something.
The numbers highlight how difficult it is for local elected and business leaders to change the makeup of a region's economy. They can cajole and nudge and offer incentives to attract specific businesses or nurture certain industries. But it is a long, and often frustrating journey with victories at the margins.
The benchmarks that No Child Left Behind requires schools to meet have been impossible for some.
“What we sent them was correct,” she said. “But there are about 16 students” who should be under the Class of 2012 instead listed as failing to graduate in four years with the Class of 2011. “It was a programming error. When we take out those 16 students, we should be at 96%, the same as in 2010.”
The key, Faigenbaum said, is proper progression, proper technique, and proper supervision. Without those, injury can occur. Children should not attempt to lift 200 pounds by themselves or on their first try, he said, but that is equally true for adults.
The only other time Ulman has raised taxes since he took office in 2006 was last year when he submitted a bill to the Howard County delegation, which the General Assembly subsequently passed, increasing the hotel tax from 5 percent to 7 percent to raise funds for the Howard County Tourism Council and the Howard County Economic Development Authority.
"San Francisco stands firm against the federal government" on the issue of medical cannabis, said Supervisor David Campos.

Smith said the United study concedes the project would have some positive economic impact, stemming in part from construction work at Hobby - 1,500 jobs and $120 million annually. But it also would mean the loss of more than 5,000 jobs at Bush and $414 million in annual economic impact resulting in a net loss of nearly 3,700 jobs and $295 million.

The result is a dozen songs that move from swaggering Stones style rock ("Superheavy") to the groove-oriented "One Day." At times the product of this culture clash borders on pastiche, and pushes dangerously close to Komar and Melamid's 1997 project, "The World's Most Wanted Song," which created musical ideas and instrumentation based on a poll of musical preferences. "Satyameva Jayathe," for example, features Rahman's chanted opening, then moves into an urgent dance hall rhythm and Jagger screaming something in Hindi. As the music world has gotten smaller, though, these kinds of border-jumping creations have increased.
I don't know that there is a lot of value in going tit for tat with dueling characterizations. The bottom line is that we're not any closer to agreement since we initiated conversations because the County to date has rejected every idea the City has offered and decided against offering counter-proposals of substance. We're off by an order of magnitude, as you know. Rhetoric like "a haphazard, rushed agreement bound to haunt future generations of City and County Commissions" is just silly and obviously doesn't advance the conversation.
Mastering the exchange is just the first step of a five-step process. From there they move on to traveling (getting the child to move from one part of the room to another to make the exchange), discrimination (a picture of celery vs. a picture of a toy car), sentence structure, and commenting, which entails prompting a child to remark on his or her surroundings.

It is, despite its title, a dance record — one that borrows its beats from crowd-pleasing Eurodisco, its steps from a shuffle craze that peaked Down Under many years ago, and its simple rhyme cadences from the Black Eyed Peas, whose will.i.am is partially responsible for the existence of the song.

Does this all excuse the homophobe's acts, their nasty legislation, their bilious congressional votes? Does it give Rick Santorum, Rick Warren, Rush Limbaugh some sort of pass? Hell no. Does it give it a hint of understanding, and perhaps empathy, as we all recognize those places in ourselves where we have been similarly programmed, lied to, horribly misled? It might. Depends on your whisky.

Yes, yes, William seems nice and has the hot body, but he bores me silly. They've got the rumba, which is not at all going to alienate his fanbase. Smokey Robinson is back singing "Being with You." It's a rumba, there's dry ice, Cheryl's wearing a bed sheet. If a soap star built like William can't knock this out of the park, he should be eliminated on the spot, tonight. Tom's already predicting Bruno will need a cold shower. Bruno said it was filthy and he loved every minute of it. Carrie Ann thanks them on behalf of all women out there but then says it wasn't their best dance and they were a little bit disconnected and calls for more content in future dances. Len says that William is physically impressive and dances with confidence, but that for him, Len, "it was a little bit on the raunchy side." THERE'S the Len we know and love. Then Len gets up and demonstrates "lateral hip action" which he says anyone, even Tom, can do, and adds he wanted to see more front to back hip action. That's a very specific critique and I'm glad to hear it.
5. Familiar sounding: This is soooo summer of 2010 -- talk of Rudy Fernandez wanting a buyout from his NBA team so he can play in his native Spain.

ALPER: False again. You have to get more than 300,000 signatures, and winning a "yes" vote is harder than winning a "no" vote. Opponents of these ballot initiatives will attempt lies and create confusion to win. Those who are active around an issue proactively have their work cut out for them.
Still, despite those monstrous sales numbers, the iPad is losing market share to rival tablets running Google's Android operating system.

The benefits of that arrangement to the union -- and to the political causes the union leadership chooses to support -- are obvious. The benefits to the employee often are considerably less so, especially when the job gets offshored, or the company goes out of business because it can no longer justify the cost of labor.
“Nursing science was made to inform this kind of work,” she said. “When I became a gynecological clinical nurse specialist and asked patients about sexual dysfunction, I began to look at the evidence. There was no good research on the patient experience in the ’70s, so I became adamant about providing that evidence.”

That's one of the reasons that so few people venture to Antarctica. This past year some 33,000 tourists visited there, fewer than visit Disneyland on an average day. Another obstacle is the rigorous journey, covering 11,000 miles from San Diego to the Antarctic Peninsula, much of it across some of the world's roughest seas. And finally there's the cost, with tours alone running $5,000 to $40,000-plus, not to mention all the subzero gear you have to buy (and will probably never use again).

Before Sunday's 90-87 win over the Warriors, Buchanan figured the Blazers needed to finish out 14-4 to have a chance at grabbing the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference.

Nothing against the authentically minded, Slow Food-endorsed, learn-from-your-elders approach. But it is best mastered in a nurturing environment that often has nothing in common with many an Old World cook. They often are short-tempered, use crummy pans and mistrust interlopers. (My dad qualifies for only two of these, and I'm not saying which.)
Unangst and Gingerelli both denied that they perceived Cowher to be Jewish, the court said.

For instance, the Hotel Latvija in Riga, Latvia. In the early 1990s, I checked in and found a maid sitting on my bed-to-be, smoking a cigarette and watching TV. ("Very good film.

Anderson enrolled in University of Miami to play on the baseball team, but didn't, and transferred to the College of Marin, eventually dropping out to move to Mexico. He went next to New York, where he did odd jobs like selling suits, telemarketing and moving furniture. He moved back to the Bay Area, and his first novel, the 225-page "Boonville" (Creative Arts, 2001) - which plumbed the depths of his life in the town with hippies, rednecks and yuppies - was written in San Francisco in a single-room-occupancy unit above Caffe Trieste in North Beach, the only housing he could afford at the time.

At arena shows, it has become an unfortunate custom to hide the band behind screens and other obstructions. Prince put the New Power Generation right in the center of the performance area. In no way did they upstage him, and that's because nobody could ever upstage Prince. He knows that well enough to allow his excellent sidemen to show off their skills. The gigantic "Love" symbol -- something like an ankh with a wasp's tail -- initially looked like yet another monument to the star's ego, which of course it was. It was also a practical bit of stage design. The symbol gave Prince three catwalks to work, and he logged time at the end of each, dancing and singing straight to the heart of the crowd. Many of the spectacular trappings of big-budget tours were employed, but the giant video screens hanging over the stage never showed anything other than the bandmembers in action.

Unless you were correctly positioned. Even after the room began to empty people were left to play the game the Crystal makes you play.

It just might. Before the game started there was a feeling around the Seton Hall team that one good game might be all it needed to get back on track. So far this season, that's been the one thing that the Pirates have had trouble with. Every time they seem to be ready to take that next leap into something consistent — they would lose.

It was clear that even though it might not have been the thing at the forefront of most of their minds, the NCAA Tournament was a catalyst. Seton Hall played with a team that was desperate to keep its postseason hopes alive. If it can harness that, they might just be able to go on a run.

Many here hope that trend is part of a general "dusting off of the Paris" contemporary art scene and a sign of shifts in France's art world.
