What makes this experiment in dramatizing comedy work are the actors' asides to the audience — moments when the action freezes and they step forward to crack a biting one-liner.

Her performance, like her sense of humor, improves as the show goes on — which, unfortunately, can’t be said for the rest of the 13-person cast, who play multiple one-joke characters with varying degrees of effectiveness and tedium. Even Rudner, hamming it up in three roles, feels unnecessary.

If his team wins, Majerus can show the world yet again that he doesn't need five-star talent to win, and if his team loses, that's exactly what you'd expect of a team whose third-best player is Cody Ellis. Either way, it makes Friday's game the most compelling game of the round of 64."

We see a future where we invest in American innovation and American ingenuity; where we export more goods so we create more jobs here at home; where we make it easier to start a business or patent an invention; where we build a homegrown, clean energy industry – because I don't want to see new solar panels or electric cars or advanced batteries manufactured in Europe or Asia. I want to see them made right here in America, by American workers.
He said Fairfield, Conn.-based GE is now finding it profitable to build manufacturing and service centers in the United States rather than overseas, because it is more competitive to do so.
-- If you need medical insurance, get a policy that provides primary coverage. Primary means the insurance company pays all the costs, up front, not just what you can't first recover from your other medical insurance. Even travelers with regular health insurance often buy primary travel medical to avoid the problem of having to pay a big bill on the spot, then go through a drawn-out claims process after they return.

At the other extreme, just two members in the 120-seat Legislature did not introduce a single sponsored bill in the session: Republican Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, of Orange County, and Mike Gatto, a Burbank Democrat. Gatto joined the Assembly after a special election in June, missing the regular deadline for introducing bills. DeVore, on the other hand, was too busy campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat. Whereas the average Assembly member introduced 32 bills in the session, DeVore introduced only three -- an acknowledgement, he said, of the demands of 360 campaign events that made it impossible for him to be present for hearings that the authors of bills are expected to attend.

Given the 100% public opposition to the budget at the hearing, these work meetings between DOE and the BOE should be public. The public said it wants state aid applied to lower the tax levy -- not to be spent. But so did the Governor and Commissioner Cerf -- that's the purpose of the funds. This could be a public relations win all around -- government doing the job properly and transparently. Trenton working with a municipality.

If you have to spend time outdoors, schedule your activities later in the day, since pollen is more prominent in the morning and dissipates as the day wears on. This is particularly true if your activity involves physical exertion, like riding a bike or playing tennis. Breathing hard means inhaling more allergens - which means more misery. After spending time outside, to avoid bringing the pollen indoors, you should remove your shoes, change clothes and take a shower.

With its clever and melodious Cole Porter score, it's still easy to understand why, in 1949, "Kiss Me, Kate" won the first Tony award for a musical. But if you haven't seen it recently, you might not remember how much of "Shrew" made it into "Kate" - not just the overall plot about squabbling strong-willed lovers, but scenes and even dialogue.

THE DEVIL YOU SAY: Octogenarian director Sidney Lumet impressed critics and showed up much younger whippersnappers with "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," a suspenseful tale of a crime gone wrong, and a family so dysfunctional they make the Sopranos look like the Waltons. The cast features Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke as brothers who decide to rob their parents' jewelry store. And if you think that sounds like a great criminal brainstorm, well, you haven't seen many movies. (R; 112 min.)

King said he expects Wallace will not pick up his option, and will choose instead to be a free agent. The team can offer him a contract extension before that -- at a maximum of two years after the option year, and 7 percent increase over the $9.5 million salary. Wallace has until June 13 to pick up his option. If he does not, he becomes an unrestricted free agent. If he becomes a free agent, the Nets cannot negotiate with him before July 1. However, they would hold Bird Rights on him, and could offer him a maximum contract of five years.
"Why send war to Iraq and peace to Jordan?" a chemistry teacher in my village of Wahadneh once asked me, when it was revealed to him that the Peace Corps is a government program, whose director is appointed by the president. It was a troubling question, to which I had a feeble answer.
The reason we get upset, says James Gross, is because that paint-spraying, trash-tossing, poop-leaving twit has disrupted the order of our life. We have a goal -- we're headed to the office, let's say, and the driver ahead of us is moping along, weaving from lane to lane -- and we are prevented from achieving it.

Morally, however, "Starships" is a black hole. This is one of the most cynical records I’ve ever heard, and I lived through the hair metal era. Minaj is betting that her listeners are so disengaged she can pass off this cut-and-paste job as her own work rather than the act of a copycat driven to sell as many records as possible, no matter the cost to her reputation. She barely shows up: The lyrics are inane, her singing is indifferent and her rapping — the thing she’s supposed to be good at — is tossed off. Her personality is an abrasive one, but it’s her own; in order to make "Starships" fly, she had to dumb it down to the point of unrecognizability.
Of course, they could choose to go in the opposite direction. Let's say something prevented them from getting together back in 2004. If that were the case, it had better be something good, because it's difficult to imagine what would have stopped them. Really, for them to blow it twice and then find themselves walking around Budapest or somewhere, flirting and babbling, now in their 40s - it would almost be unseemly.
The story is painfully different, though, when the appalling epithet erupts from someone who is otherwise beloved in our lives.

After decades of lawsuits, damning reports about industry practices, and stop-smoking campaigns, smoking rates have plummeted, from a high of 42% of adults in 1965  a year after the surgeon general's first report on smoking and health  to just over 19% today.

A new coat of paint, we are informed by those in the know, works major wonders in selling a creaking house. No surprise that the theory applies to ballet as well. Martin Pakledinaz's fresh decor and costumes for the San Francisco Ballet's "Don Quixote" have given this much-fussed-over 19th century relic substantial eye appeal.

Remarkably, Mr. Sandusky was neither arrested nor charged with a crime at that time.

So, yes, it is easy to be swept away by the bad. It is understandable why optimistic Mets fans almost always feel the need to preface their hope, even in April, with qualifiers: “Look, I don’t expect to win the World Series, but …” “I’m not saying this is the ’86 Mets, but …” And so on. And so on.

But plenty of companies are keeping the spigots open. Occidental Petroleum CEO Ray Irani, for example, received $400,000 worth of financial planning, part of a $30 million pay package in 2008. To put it another way, that $400,000 in financial planning is more than the total annual household income of the vast majority of Americans. Occidental spokesman Richard Kline said the comprehensive financial planning helps Irani to "keep his complete attention on the company's business."

øIn fact, we think this creates a dilemma for the Edmonton Oilers, who might be the first team to be disappointed by winning the lottery. The Oilers are stacked up front on the forward lines and desperately need a puck mover on the back end to trigger what should quickly become an explosive offense. They could have happily selected a Murray or a Matt Dumba second overall after Nail Yakupov came off the board. But now, how do you sell to your fan base using the first pick to take a player with significantly less upside than Yakupov?

Dr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals — some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do.

Hurd denies making any advances on Jodie Fisher, who worked as a marketing contractor for HP from 2007 to 2009, according to this person, who requested anonymity because of not being authorized to discuss the case.
HP determined that Hurd didn't violate the company's sexual harassment policies in his interactions with Fisher.

Hurd says he didn't prepare his own expenses and that Fisher's name was not intentionally left off any reports.
Bruce Hill developed his pizza passion about the time he took over Roxanne's to turn it into Picco and tried to figure out what to do with the adjacent space that had been the deli. Yet like all great cooks, he became obsessed, and his obsession benefits us all.

KT: In my book I talk about functional movement like squats and lunges. Crunches aren't necessarily bad, they're just terribly overused and misunderstood. Crunches are fine when done in harmony with functional movement. Kids need to squat freestanding and move like they do when playing outside. Pushing and pulling on a rope swing will do more for you abs than crunching. Sitting in school all day, doing homework, watching TV, riding in a car, etc., starts to create the problem. We're in flexion all day and then we lie down on our back and crunch. Flexion, flexion, flexion and no extension.

Off and on since then, the precise organ of female orgasm has been hotly debated. Many, including the father of modern psychiatry, Sigmund Freud, asserted that the vaginal walls were strongly implicated. Others, noting the paucity of nerve endings on the surface of the vaginal walls and the comparative density of nerve endings in the female clitoris, countered that the organ of female pleasure was plain for all to see.
