He's been gone from the Senate since the first of the year, but George Voinovich's fingerprints could be on the deal that finally ends the debt ceiling standoff that has Washington tied in knots and Wall Street on edge. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and his GOP counterpart Mitch McConnell are discussing a commission that would develop a broad tax reform proposal and perhaps a second that would suggest ways to restructure Social Security and Medicare. Whatever's proposed would be subject to a straight up-or-down vote -- no amendments, no cherry-picking the popular stuff and skipping the pain. Voinovich spent his final years on Capitol Hill trying to convince his colleagues -- and two presidents -- to use that model to tackle the deficit. The best he could do was the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson commission which produced a tough, smart blueprint for fiscal sanity that's yet to see the light of day in Congress.

Mr. Conde uses Yammer, a Twitter-like system open only to employees. It allows people to brag, share information and learn about the work of others. "I think that a CEO needs to focus more on the platform that enables collaboration," Mr. Conde says. The boss, these days, is "more like the producer of the show, rather than being the lead." Not that Mr. Conde wants to be endlessly connected to technology. He tells Mr. Bryant that he tries to set aside 90 minutes every day free from the phone and personal computer.

Heuchera (coral bells), those low-growing shade garden plants with a multitude of leaf patterns and colors, are still the most interesting entries in the shade category. Breeders are coming up with new colors every day. Heuchera, close kin of Tiarella and Heucherella, are hardy little plants but deer have noticed them in my garden. Spray them as you protect hosta and day lilies. Heuchera send up a scape of tiny, mostly pink flowers in spring that sits well above the leaves. When flowers are done, look to the interesting leaves of 'Miracle' for a bright maroon color surrounded by a thin lime green margin, rather like an old Persian carpet. Other tempting varieties are 'Plum Royale' and 'Tiramisu', but gardeners should see these plants to decide which of the colors will enhance their particular gardens. Remember to play light and dark leaves against each other for interest. Gather a few in your shopping cart and wander around a garden center, making combinations for your beds and containers, designing on the hoof, you might say. And don't just buy one: remember to mass plants for better effect, especially when the plants themselves remain small, as coral bells usually do. Plant three of the same together, and add a plant with a different texture like a large fern or hosta for contrast of form and texture. In pots, only one of a kind may be needed to compose a pleasing look with other flowers and foliage.

Johnson's life as a sari-draped nun, when she was known as Sister Donata, was troubled from almost the start.

Far from tending to Calcutta's poor, Johnson spent most of her years as a nun in and around Rome studying, teaching, writing theological curricula and doing paperwork.

These are a reminder of the restaurant's former life as a cafe. A few years ago Rulli changed concepts and remodeled, but the place still has the feel of an elegant pastry shop, what with the whimsical frescos on the walls and ceiling, centered by an impressive Venetian glass chandelier.

Mr. Jobs turned Apple into the largest retailer of music and helped popularize computer-animated films as the financier and CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, which he later sold to Walt Disney Co.

Despite its vast oil reserves,Venezuela's troubles are mounting. The country is politically and economically divided. Unemployment is rampant and inflation has hovered near 30%. The country's homicide rate is among the highest in the hemisphere, with near-daily reports of killings and kidnappings. And even the president's most ardent supporters now concede that his "Bolivarian" socialist revolution is losing its appeal as voters tire of his constant campaigning and vitriolic attacks against opponents.
Yes, and yes. Once you see them for yourself, these distinctive zones make sense.

Dated technological references, however, are a problem. (Jack calls a friend to “Google” some information –- an expositional device that no longer scans, as the affluent Jack would almost certainly have a smartphone.)

A subsequent article in the 9/15/11 edition cited an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent; not exactly a decrease as touted in Mr. Sorce's letter.

Walker noting that cuts in Medicaid were expected. So thank you Mr. Sorce, and good luck with your move to Wisconsin.

Gordon, who wrote about her father and his many deceptions in "The Shadow Man," tackles the life of her mother, Anna Gagliano, in this moving memoir. Reflecting on Anna's life, Gordon sees much more than one woman's biography: "My mother's story is a story of physical affliction (polio, alcoholism, senile dementia), and of a historical moment importantly colored by the experience of immigration, world war, and the Great Depression. It is the story of a particular moment in American Catholicism, and of the American working class."
The Ko Olina Marina claimed a Disney link even before Aulani first opened its doors in August: One of the ships used in the latest "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies is docked there. The marina is also a launching spot for catamaran snorkeling excursions that head to the warm waters near the electric plant at Kahe Point.

The Smithereens struggled for five years before attaining anything like commercial success. It would be another five before the band scraped the Top 40. This isn't particularly uncommon -- bands in every genre have difficulty finding audiences. What's unusual is that the Smithereens have hung together, more or less, for 31 years, through some very tough times. Even at the height of the band's popularity, there always seemed to be a shadow across the path. Grunge kicked the legs out from under the Mersey and Mod revival movements of the late '80s. The group was accused of cribbing from R.E.M., even though the Smithereens developed their sound long before R.E.M. went mainstream.

When guests want to visit Sausalito, the place to send them for lunch or dinner is this Italian restaurant overlooking the marina. Diners can eat in the room facing the open kitchen , with a handsome interior that features beautifully crafted terra cotta floors, marble baseboards and mahogany arches.

The wood-fired oven adds smoky nuances to lamb meatballs, roast chicken and petrale sole, and the accompanying produce comes from the restaurant's garden.

The chairman insisted that Dexia faces a crisis of liquidity, not solvency -- meaning it is not bankrupt, but just doesn't have the ready cash it needs in the short-term. That is why the bank managed to pass pan-European stress tests just this summer, Dehaene said.
The Noise Review Board presented the report to the council in 2005. It noted research that said side effects of lost sleep can include elevated blood pressure and respiratory levels.
Still, most agree the United States had more than enough talent to at least reach the crucial semifinals. Flashes were there during the 6-0 win over Cuba and an inspired comeback against El Salvador, in which the United States rallied from a 2-1 deficit to take a 3-2 lead. But in crucial stretches, the United States played not to lose, which came as a surprise from a team coached by Porter, whose Akron teams are known for attacking. Porter has come under fire this week for inflexible formations.
In the capital, which has most of those left homeless by the earthquake, government officials evacuated a few families from a camp for quake victims to a school, said Jean-Joseph Edgard, an administrator in Haiti's Civil Protection Department.

Best Backstory, runner-up: Liberian Romeo Diahn. Because he lived in a refugee camp. His audition was adorable. I wasn't wowed. I do find him endearing as he showed heart when he sang. (Verdict: Hollywood!)
There's a sense of a time warp when you are staying at the Circle Z Ranch in southern Arizona. Many of the buildings date back to the guest ranch's beginnings in the 1920s. There are no phones or TVs in the cottages. Cellphone reception can be spotty, and the nearest Wi-Fi is at the public library in Patagonia, four miles away.
What Does the Product Look Like? MMI distributed the Nakaochi Scrape AA and AAA to several distributors that may have broken the shipments into smaller lots for further distribution.

The boxes contain several vacuum-wrapped packages with no further labeling.
MTA spokesman Terry Owens acknowledged the transfer to the "bus bridge" would add time to the trip. "I would tell people, give yourself an extra half-hour to get through downtown," he said.
Revascularization, which is re-establishing blood flow, can be done in a variety of ways. When you had a bypass graft, was one of your blood vessels used for the bypass? I take it that it was. Artificial grafts have long been used as a way to "bypass" the clog and establish circulation between the upper and lower unclogged portions of the artery. Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene are two artificial materials used to re-establish flow through the artery. They work well. After one year from installation of an artificial graft, the artery is wide open 90 percent of the time. After five years, it's open 70 percent to 80 percent of the time.

The reality is that the new strategic partnership agreement is not all things to all people. By the end of this summer, there still will be 68,000 troops in Afghanistan. The new agreement authorizes the U.S. military to "advise and assist" the Afghan military through at least 2024. That could translate to another 12 years of repeating our mistakes, with tens of thousands of soldiers still in harm's way.
"Despite the challenges, I think the health of local television news is very good," said Dominic, a consultant for Channel 3. "I think what is happening is the anchors go through a phase of, at first, disbelief, but then a realization that even though their salaries are lower, they are still making a pretty good buck. Once that happens, everything settles down again."
The rebound in manufacturing is gaining momentum, the report showed. The new orders index rose to a seven-year high. A measure of order backlogs rose to its highest level in a year.

Pierre Bouchard, a member of the Canadiens himself from 1970-78, said his father remained active until the end of his life.
The ancient Orthodox icon of the Resurrection is titled "The Descent into Hades," because it depicts Jesus descending into hell and liberating our progenitors from their self-inflicted captivity to the devil.

Kwapis creates genuine suspense as the scores of volunteers struggle against time and the elements to free these creatures.

But by the time the Lions got around to sending Calvin Johnson to the podium to announce their pick -- after he plugged his Madden football cover (and by the way, can we stop acting like being chosen to grace a video game is somehow the equivalent of making the Hall of Fame?) -- there was little else for Detroit to do but pick an offensive lineman.

The maneuvering mirrors the internal squabbling within the Ohio Republican Party, where allies of Gov. John Kasich are eager to dump Chairman Kevin DeWine.

Cost tops the list of what motivates light-rail opponents. Original CRC estimates for light rail were $1.17 billion, but the project's costs are fluid because of uncertainty about the bridge design and unknowns associated with acquiring land. The expectation is that construction costs would come from the federal government, with a local sales tax increase paying for operations and maintenance. A C-Tran measure seeking a bump in the sales tax for light-rail maintenance might end up on the 2012 ballot.

More than one! I am a bit of a klutz, not a good trait when you are working around so many dangerous plants. The first incident that springs to mind was a run-in with the sharp tip of a Phormium leaf (New Zealand Flax).

The proof is on the plate, and it's often spectacular. Mina has kept the fine-dining edge, adding the vibrancy and excitement diners expect today.

Holmgren: "Well you take four quarterbacks to camp, we always do. We'll have a decision to make at some point probably when we cut down to 53. Traditionally, I always kept three some teams kept two. You want to be strong, you want to have the best guys, give them a chance to compete, all those kind of things. Really, the questions on the quarterbacks, and I know it's an important deal, but we are nowhere ready at all to answer most of these questions. It just isn't there yet."

Minadakis makes some odd directorial choices as well. Kurt Landisman's moody lighting of J.B. Wilson's spartan set works well, but what's with the Cheshire-Cat-grin light sliver in the early scenes? The cutting of the text mostly heightens the central drama, but why, when you're making the women's roles stronger (as with Fumiko Bielefeldt's Renaissance military costumes) remove the lines in Othello's immortal wooing speech in which Desdemona engineers his courtship? And why stage Iago's first incursion into Othello's complacency so far from the audience?
"When the spring kind of started, as you were kind of looking at it you were thinking, 'Well, maybe he's going to fill the fourth or fifth spot,' " offensive coordinator Dan Roushar said Tuesday. "And maybe that'll be true, but right now he's starting to show more than that."

Bate chronicles the whole woolly story with admirable clarity and resourcefulness, even when a lack of visual material forces him to resort too often to re-enactment and dramatization. He captures the giddy, voyeuristic thrill of hearing Ray and Peter go hammer and tongs in arguments so vile, yet so pathetic, that their audiences felt simultaneously repelled, amused, horrified and ashamed.

WASHINGTON - Last week, a draft memo surfaced from the Homeland Security Department suggesting ways to administratively circumvent existing law to allow several categories of illegal immigrants to avoid deportation and, indeed, for some to be granted permanent residency.

øIt's important for investors to understand that while Apple is very important to the market, it's not the market.

Isolated agricultural towns dominate California 99 between Fresno and Modesto, but that doesn't mean a lack of options for curious travelers. The cozy tasting room of Beekman & Beekman Honey Farm in Hughson welcomed us with samples of floral-infused honey and wine amid dried lavender displays and old family photos and farm tools. At the Buchanan Hollow Nut Co. in Le Grand, owner Sharleen Robson gave us a free tour "out back" of her 30-year-old farm, which includes organic pistachio, cherry, olive and almond trees. If there are kids involved and she has time, she might even lead you a half-mile to the duck pond.

DG: No prob. I could see how all the "predictions" and "projections" could get tricky for a reader. But understand all these things are fluid. When you're talking about "predicting" the first round of the draft, you're dealing with something that is happening in a few months, in a few weeks and then, finally, in a few hours. That involves a tremendous amount of reporting and gumshoe journalism to talk to scouts and talk to officials and divine what player they would like to take and then put that information to use by determining what player will be available for them to take. The effort put into those predictions is tremendous. The writers doing those predictions don't pull out a crystal ball. They pull out a phone and work it. When it comes to the "future" lineups, who can you call? How could someone writing the 2010 Cardinals lineup back in 2006 possibly know that they would trade Jim Edmonds and Scott Rolen and acquire Matt Holliday? You can't report that because it wasn't even on the horizon for any of the teams involved. It would been dart-board journalism. Back in 2005, it would have taken a psychic to put Jaime Garcia in the 2010 rotation. He had just been drafted and had not pitched a pro inning. When you think of it as a depth chart, the rule regarding Pujols' free agent status makes even more sense. It's a good tool to illustrate what that lineup would look like if the Cardinals are required to only start the players they have on hand today. It's a good thing they aren't.
Joe Kucharz, project executive for Navigant, a national health consulting company, says that organizations are replacing hospitals built primarily in the 1950s and '70s due to population shifts, new technology and increases in elderly population.
