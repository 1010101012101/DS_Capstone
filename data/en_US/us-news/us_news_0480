Henry's lifelong work to provide quality education and social services to the poor was honored by presidents, governors and mayors over more than four decades and left an indelible mark on the community and her name on facilities treating the needy. She served on President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty task force that led to the Head Start program that brings nutrition and early childhood education to inner-city children. She was best known for her work catering to local needs as director of the Avalon-Carver Community Center serving South-Central Los Angeles.

"I think that welfare of our country is just as important if not more important than the welfare of the state of New Jersey," Christie said. "I made a commitment to the people of the state of New Jersey."
"If for no other reason than for the Blues," McLellan said. "I mean, they have (David) Perron, (Andy) McDonald and (Alex) Steen all in the lineup, that's a lot of high-end skill they did not have all at once most of the season. So they're a different team in that way and that's part of the challenge for us."

"He is a stunningly wonderful human being all the way around," said Lee, a lifestyle magazine and cooking show phenom. "In Andrew's case, most importantly, it's what's on the inside, his lifelong history of public service, that make him one of the sexiest men alive."
You can't really go wrong with the empanadas, either. Sturdy yet flaky dough is filled with slow-roasted pork, spinach, carrots and salty white Chihuahua cheese, and then sealed with the pressure from fork tines. Three piping hot postcard-sized turnovers are topped with a shredded arugula salad and a smoky poblano nage. Instead of an entrée, next time I will order them as an appetizer to share.
"This year, they've showed us they care about us," Brian Sanderson of La Jolla said, citing the free agency moves more than anything. "I appreciate that a lot."
A: One thing that has been encouraging: The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index has been shooting up. Builders are seeing signs of increasing demand. But it remains at a low level. So it's ambiguous evidence. But that might be taken as a sign that the market is improving.
"To place any discussion of these vast topics at the broadcaster's peril has the effect of promoting wide self-censorship of valuable material which should be completely protected under the First Amendment," it added.
"We love it here," says Dean Devlin, the show's executive producer. Instead of being cranky and jaded by the presence of film crews around town -- as Los Angeles residents often are, for example -- Portlanders are invariably polite, Devlin says. "People are here so nice."
Yet some school reform groups are leery of investing more in public education, absent reforms such as measures to hold administrators and teachers more accountable for student performance. Brown, for his part, seems increasingly opposed to adding more rules on school accountability. Yet he clearly doesn't like the timing of Munger's measure, which, as noted above, could undercut support for his own proposal to raise taxes.
The risk is unmistakable. The world of animation gets more crowded by the day, with feature films, DVDs, TV series and video games competing for consumers' attention. And "Coraline" isn't your typical talking-animal romp or potpourri of pop culture references.
We know you're busy. We know you're neglecting your work in a desperate bid to get some sensible information about Murray State. We know how this whole bracket adventure turned out for you last year.

The Ohio Board of Regents will then grade the programs by 2012 -- although some information could be made available sooner. The state has to be careful of grade inflation, and it needs to make sure that it holds programs accountable for their actions -- or lack thereof.

Maryliz: Hi Gail, haven't been able to follow lately so I just wanted to apologize at this late date for asking you to root for Ozzie on Survivor this year. It was a pitiful season, and Ozzie was reprehensible in the way he treated poor Cochran. I do think he could have a great career modeling snorkeling equipment, however.

A: No, they will be far more of a challenge, if only because they're healthy. Basically, they will throw more good players at the Heat than the Knicks had available. What they don't have are proven go-to scorers who can create their own offense in close, late-game situations. This will be a nice series for the Heat to re-set themselves against a more typical playoff opponent than the all-'Melo-all-the-time approach they saw from the Knicks and Carmelo Anthony. Rebounding will be crucial.
Duerson and others believed that the pounding NFL players take causes head injuries that impact them later in life, leading to depression and other diseases.

One AP voter knocked Oregon entirely off his ballot after the Ducks’ 40-27 loss to LSU. All the Ducks did was put 69 on Nevada – not that putting 69 on Nevada is evidence of dominance, but it’s obvious Oregon is still the electric team it was last year.

One night, he's making his version of gazpacho. In the center of a shallow bowl of heirloom tomato water sits a pile of diced sushi-grade albacore with tomato, cucumber, basil and slivered red onions, an utterly refreshing summer dish. A chilled Dungeness crab salad is bright with the crunch of green papaya, slivered chiles and a pugnacious green curry vinaigrette.
Bosley-Reynolds brings a depth and slyness to the king, who wants to move his country into the modern era but is stymied by long-held cultural values and beliefs. Bosley-Reynolds softens the edges of the staid monarch with flashes of genuine warmth. His tenderness with the children — picking up the tiniest princess who bows the wrong way and gently putting her down right — and his effective delivery of the solo "A Puzzlement" had the audience squarely in his corner.

I had to remind myself that this is what I signed up for, this was the whole point of the day.
Kevin Pelton, Basketball Prospectus: At this point, the Blazers can't really count on Joel Pryzbilla for regular minutes. Przy could probably still successfully box out NBA players well until his 60s, and his veteran savvy makes him effective at the defensive floor, but he strikes little fear into the hearts of opposing defenses. Przybilla would still be very handy to have around as a third center and voice in the locker room. The problem is those exact same descriptions apply to Kurt Thomas, who is under contract for next season. I don't see room for both players on a 15-player roster that will add several newcomers. So Przybilla's future may depend on whether Portland can move Thomas.
Authorities in Paterson are searching for the victim's killer. Anyone with information about the attack should contact the Paterson Police Department detective bureau at (973) 321-1120.
I poked into our kitchen the end of last week, and found some sunchokes, parsnips, leeks and asparagus in the refrigerator, and a couple of potatoes in the vegetable basket. With those ingredients, soup seemed to be a good option. Leeks, potatoes and cream are in classic vichyssoise - a thick soup that is typically served cold, though hot potato leek soup is also delicious.

GREENSBORO, N.C. — After days of salacious testimony about a mistress, a love child and naked political ambition, John Edwards' criminal campaign finance trial focused Wednesday on the credibility of the prosecution's chief witness.
A little national pride at the U.S. Open too much to ask? We’ll go with Fish, who arrives for the first time as the highest-ranked American, and big-serving Isner. Fish reached the final in Montreal, losing to Djokovic in three sets, and he would seem to be the best hope for U.S. tennis’ first Grand Slam winner since 2003. No, really, 2003. And Isner, whose game is most devastating on hard courts (despite his notoriety at Wimbledon last summer), can pose major problems for any of the top players. Just look at the way he dismantled one-time American darling Andy Roddick this past week (7-6, 6-4 in Winston-Salem).

When I suggested to Mahan recently that he may have ceded control of his original concept for The Waterboy to his clientele, he insisted he had not. And yet, the restaurant may be a victim of its own success. Now, it is stodgy more than it is bohemian, self-serious more than it is fun.

It is from the heart of this disconnection, this chasm between America that is and America that ought to be, that Springsteen issues his report.

Down here below, we're shackled and drawn." On "We Take Care Of Our Own," the anger is accusatory, a demand for an America that looks out for Americans.

I totally agree with the "Readers Respond" letter from Roz Ellis Heid, responding to the city's idea of possibly selling, leasing, or maintaining 15 historic City landmarks ("City eyeing sale of 15 sites," March 21). As Ms. Heid, Baltimore Heritage Executive Director Johns Hopkins and The Sun article note, a number of volunteer groups, including Friends of Orianda House (Crimea Mansion), Baltimore City Historical Society (Peale Museum), and the Roland Water Tower Preservation Campaign have invested money and thousands of hours to preserve and restore these historic landmarks. There are probably others as well who have labored quietly to save other historic treasures. The city should not ignore the dedicated efforts of these citizens.

Nokia Lumia 900 -- In recent years, the world's largest phone maker, Finland's Nokia Corp., has practically been a no-show in the U.S. market. That's hurt the company badly.

And this is not just another run-of-the-mill political debate. There's always chatter in Washington. Folks argue about whether the sun rises in the east and whether it sets in the west, whether the sky is blue. (Laughter.) There's always going to be arguments in Washington. But this one is different, because we're talking about the central challenge of our time. Right now, we have two competing visions of our future, and the choice could not be clearer. And let me say, those folks on the other side, I am sure they are patriots, I'm sure they're sincere in terms of what they say. But their theory, I believe, is wrong.

Why has "The Avengers" elicited such rabid, near-unanimous pre-release love from critics and audiences? I'm not sure, but consider this: At a recent preview screening, a short scene during the end credits elicited a roar of surprised hoots and hollers (including mine) from the audience. But later, talking to people in the lobby, I couldn't find anyone who knew what we had just seen in that teaser. Why did everyone get so excited and cheer then? Maybe it's because we love these characters so much, we're willing to embrace anything Whedon serves us, because he has obvious respect and affection for the material. Good intentions, though, aren't enough.

Schiff, 66, a composer and music professor at Reed College, puts Ellington head-to-head with the great Igor Stravinsky, not to pick a winner, but to suggest that their music can be talked about in the same terms. Both were assemblers who borrowed, incorporated and reharmonized music. Ellington had more in common with Stravinsky than an improvisational genius like John Coltrane, Schiff claims.

That's what will be determined over the next few months.

Bolton gave Tucson, also a plaintiff in the Escobar case, two weeks to file a written argument telling her why she should not also dismiss its claim.

Next up is the Morgan Library & Museum at Madison Avenue and 36th Street, built as the private domain of financier Pierpont Morgan in 1906, later recast as a nonlending public institution. Now we commoners can gawk at the myriad cultural prizes Morgan amassed between 1890 and 1913, including medieval manuscripts, letters by Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, handwritten scores by Mozart and Beethoven and three Gutenberg Bibles. The walnut bookshelves rise three stories. The fireplace is big enough to burn three Christmas trees at once (although we discourage this because it can be dangerous). Next door, in a bright, contemporary space that Renzo Piano designed for the Morgan's 2006 expansion, temporary exhibitions rotate.
"We are attacking on a variety of fronts. We can use federal money to get some homes back to first-class condition and then sell them," the mayor said. "The boarding houses were nuisances.

A poll by the same firm taken two years later found 65% of Michigan voters thought the loans were a good idea. That contrasts with national polls showing a slight majority of Americans opposing the loans.

Round 3 (pick No. 91): Isaiah Pead, RB, Cincinnati. Pead, a shifty back with third-down capabilities, turned heads at the Senior Bowl as a kick returner.

"Too much content" is a good problem to have, the kind that means Figment is working, that its primary message — this is a literary outlet — has been received. "Young writers want a place to experiment, to take a risk and get a response," observes Goodyear, "to have that daring feeling of putting themselves out there." Because of this, she adds, it's key that Figment function as part of "their creative lives" — a telling choice of phrase that suggests the credit the site gives its users, the faith that they are serious about their work. This in itself is a radical concept, in a culture that tends to think of teenagers in terms of market share.
