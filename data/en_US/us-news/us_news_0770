Top Picks Analysis: The Cowboys made one of this draft's boldest moves by shipping their No. 14 overall pick and second-rounder to St. Louis to garner Claiborne, widely regarded as this year's premier cover cornerback. The 2011 Thorpe Award honoree boasts the arm length to efficiently jam receivers at the line of scrimmage as well as the fluidity to mirror opponents down the field, and should instantly upgrade a secondary that was a big sore spot last season. Dallas didn't stop there in its quest to bolster the defense, spending its next three selections on that side of the ball. Crawford isn't much of a pass rusher at this stage, but has the functional strength to contribute as a rotational end in Rob Ryan's 3-4 scheme, while Wilber is a quality athlete with the movement skills to possibly take over for Anthony Spencer if the latter departs as a free agent after this season.

Pursuing and signing Flynn as a free agent is a costly proposition. If the Packers franchise Flynn with the intent of trading him, the price tag could be a No. 2 pick, or higher, plus the $50 million or so it would take to tie up Flynn to a long-term contract. That's a huge investment, so the Browns have to be convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that Flynn will be the quarterback to eventually take them to the Super Bowl.

Lil' Mickey's puts quite a bit of emphasis on its sauce, proclaiming on its menu that it's "home of 'The Sauce'" and noting that all meat is served wet (sauce on) unless requested dry. The sauce is tangy and sweet with a slightly syrupy consistency, flecked with what I took to be black pepper and paprika, perhaps blended into a commercial or homemade seasoned salt. In any event, it's a sauce with a lot going on, and the various flavors give it a fair amount of depth, with the traditional white bread served alongside to mop up every last drop.

The inning positioned the Cardinals to extend a powerful trend as they are 15-2 when scoring more than three runs.

Maryland revenues have steadily increased over the last four years, yet Gov.Martin O'Malley's administration continues to bemoan budget shortfalls. Maryland doesn't have a revenue problem; this administration has a spending problem. A spending problem that Governor O'Malley intends to solve by raising taxes. He's also proposing a 6 percent sales tax on gas while prices at the pump are topping $3.75 a gallon. Governor O'Malley, please stop trying to solve Maryland's budget shortfalls by loading the burden onto the backs of Maryland taxpayers. We already pay too much!
Some cases took years to crack. In 2008, the Strike Force helped the FBI break up a national drug smuggling network that stretched from Arizona to Minnesota and Ohio, a case that began in 2005.

Joe Bauserman, Pryor's current backup, will be a senior next year, but he may not be the favorite in a quarterback competition. Incoming freshman Braxton Miller is the No. 2 quarterback recruit in the country according to Rivals.com and comes from a higher-level high school program than Pryor did. He looks more ready to step in as a freshman, and remember that Pryor took the job from senior Todd Boeckman after three weeks despite how raw he was. Current No. 3 quarterback Kenny Guiton could have a real shot at the job as well, while Taylor Graham, who redshirted this season, would be the darkhorse. Even if someone like Bauserman is technically the starter in the opener against Akron, it's almost certain that Miller will see the field. And he could see it for every snap.
If the method by which a school district is governed guaranteed the academic success of its students, Cleveland's system by now would have found a way to improve markedly.

Opening act Semi Precious Weapons began their set in a blur of glittering absurdity and only got sillier from there. Lead singer Justin Tranter is a caricature of NYC glam culture: he appeared in a leather jacket, gold pumps, torn fishnet stockings, and a hairdo, loud as a fighter jet screeching overhead, that made him look like the second coming of Tom Bailey from the Thompson Twins. His lyrics combine the glamorous with the straight-up incomprehensible; "put a diamond in it and bite down," went a representative chorus. One song revealed that Tranter won't eat because food costs too much; another demanded free booze as a birthright. Playing at stylish poverty was a major component of the act.

Jazz Fusion with only the best players: Up and coming, Mike Prigodich has wasted no time getting only the most talented players for his project, a not so overly daunting version of jazz fusion that tickles your frontal lobe yet is easy to listen to. Most groups in this genre miss the mark by creating something so complex that the music ditches the audience, and then speeds away down a highway of chaos. Not so with this star-studded line up of old-soul players.

Instead, school districts can't move to fire teachers for four months of each year — mid-May to mid-September — and are limited in the evidence they can produce to justify their complaints.

Take housing, for example. Two-thirds of the area's homes were built before 1970.

A: Yes, but a 66-game schedule is not. And that's where most of this asterisk-footnote talk, as you call it, comes from. To some, these injuries are the result of the compacted schedule. Fine. If that's the way they want it, then the Heat parade will be 66/82nds of its scheduled length. Don't stress. Enjoy. There always will be excuses why 29 other teams don't win. Now, if the Heat don't win, then this clearly is an asterisk-footnote season.

Romney never had the love to start with. He did not win the nomination in a euphoric gush of voter enthusiasm; he captured it with superior organization and lots of money.

With the days of April dwindling down, the Cranford Girls Lacrosse team was in danger of entering the month of May winless but in their penultimate game in April the Cougars finally broke into the win column with a hard fought 12-9 home victory over New Providence on Saturday, April 28. Cranford broke to an 8-5 halftime lead and held off the Pioneers repeatedly in the second half. Senior Rebecca Roman, the team’s leading scorer all season, scored four goals, junior Morgan Mason added three goals and senior Colleen Hartnett added two goals and three assists.

At the time, injuries to running backs Peyton Hillis and Montario Hardesty left Shurmur with Chris Ogbonnaya, signed two weeks earlier from the Houston practice squad, as his only running threat. The occasion called for offensive creativity -- anything to produce a win against St. Louis. It was evident throughout the game that Shurmur was selling out to win this game. He dusted off the Wildcat formation for Josh Cribbs and also dialed up a razzle-dazzle play that resulted in a Colt McCoy pass to Seneca Wallace for 21 yards.

The place is famous for its lasagna, but any pasta with red sauce will do. There are also chicken dishes, ravioli, gnocchi, veal, a steak and a burger. We especially liked the pasta forno, an ovenproof pan filled with pasta tubes, sausage, melted provolone and, just in case you miss your grandmother topping off your plate, a hard-boiled egg cooked along with it. Make a reservation on weekends or you are cooking sauce at home. Consider, also, getting your car washed next door by Bruno's brother. He'll do it while you eat.

The bandleader and part-time deejay wanted the iPod to feature songs spanning the alphabet but said he'll make up for the missing tracks another way.

The metal of the countertop was still hot from service. Everyone got a glass for wine from the half-empty bottles left over from the dining room, and after 13 hours came the final push of the night: the menu meeting. For me, this one-hour meeting defined the ethos of the kitchen - the high expectations, the responsibility, the thoughtfulness, the talent, the sometimes rigid pursuit of perfection. Does it really matter if cucumber repeats on the menu? I wondered.

Hey, Tony: Let's give it up for a guy nobody ever talks about but he's the best at what he does, Ryan Pontbriand. The guy has never had a bad snap (if so I can't remember when) in his 8+ years.

"One reason that television continually turns to stars from previous decades is that they're known entities," said Bianculli, author of "Dangerously Funny: The Uncensored Story of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" (Touchstone, 2009). "It's the same reason television keeps remaking old shows. It's a safer choice than the untried and the unknown. And like old shows, these veteran stars aren't always treated well, but who else is going to embrace them if not television?"

Condola Rashad in “Stick Fly”
Just behind the hotel lies the intoxicating village of Ribeira, Porto's deepest medieval core. It is a warren of cobbled back streets, with crumbling Baroque townhouses that bulge out at the front like a sea swell, Gothic churches, wrought iron balconies dangling ivy, steep climbs and dead-end alleys. The whole maze wraps in on itself, like a storied secret or a Portuguese casbah, not sinister but contained. It reveals itself slowly.

"The industry is in such a state of flux, because of the economy and because things are underperforming at the box office," said Irish actor Colin Farrell, Globe-nominated for the comedy "In Bruges." "A lot of films are falling apart. . . . I have a lot of friends who are excited to go to work on certain things and the gigs are falling apart. Some pieces are falling apart very close to principal photography. Climate-wise, it's a worrying time for the industry.

The power struggle boils down to three main groups. There is the Muslim Brotherhood, already dominating parliament and seeking the presidency as well. There is the military, which may be trying to ensure a candidate amenable to its aims holds the presidency. And finally, there are liberal, leftist and secular groups, which drove last year's uprising but have not made strong showings in elections so far. They — and even some Islamists — are concerned about the Brotherhood gaining too much power but also do not want to see the generals keep their authority.

He positions himself to be thin as a blade—a slim target. His chin is always tucked behind his left shoulder. He deftly uses his right hand to pick off incoming jabs and hooks.

There was a cheesy TV commercial in the 1960s or '70s which showed a bunch of young people on a hilltop singing, "I'd like to buy the world a Coke." Even 25 million bucks wouldn't cover that, but if you wait until Shop 'n' Save runs a special, you could afford about 90 million 12-ounce Coca-Colas.

I liked him. But I suspected we would never meet again. This is the nature of reporting. Quick intimacies are formed, but they dissolve just as rapidly. I spoke with Buddy once again on the phone, just a brief conversation to see how he was doing, but did not think of him again until I was sitting at home one evening in March 1997, when the office called with the news: Buddy Miley had been found dead in a Michigan motel room. It appeared to have been a suicide, and it happened to have been aided by Jack Kevorkian, the so-called “Dr. Death.” Years later, Al Pacino would play him in a biopic, but in 1997, he was one step ahead of the law as he left bodies strewn across Michigan in his effort to promote euthanasia. Buddy was the 49th of about 130 patients who embraced his grim mercies.

A victory in the final would also cap a Cinderella run for Munich, which had to beat Zurich in a two-leg playoff just to qualify for the tournament. Then it wound up winning the so-called Group of Death — losing just once, to Manchester City, in six group-stage matches. Next the Germans dominated Basel, 7-0, in their second-leg match in the round of 16 — the largest single-game margin of victory in the Champions League knockout phase — before shutting out French side Marseille twice in the quarterfinals.

Look, I've heard all the superior stuff about stretchy plastic bags. A fraction of the 100 billion bags Americans use get recycled. It takes from 40 to 100,000 years for them to degrade (depending of the microbes in the neighborhood). As litter, they cause havoc in the ecosystem.

In choreographic terms, "Firebird" can be as hard to capture and tame as the mythological creature herself. More than a few choreographers have been burned by the score, but Ratmansky has a firm grip on Slavic storytelling using classical ballet vocabulary toward dramatic means. At his best, he summons music, emotion and technique to create illustrious images onstage.
The guy has a flair for the dramatic too. In his previous 13 home openers, he's batted .354 with four homers, four doubles and 11 RBIs in 48 at-bats. When the White Sox beat the Indians 1-0 in 2005, the Mark Buehrle-Jake Westbrook gem that set the tone for a championship season, Konerko scored the game's only run.

If something is humorous, a lot of people will give it a lot less credence or respect. I certainly get respect from my fans. But in the broader sense, people don't necessarily look at me the same way they'd look at a nonhumorous act.
Since Beaird and Tiernan can be considered old-timers, it came as no surprise for them to refer to 1955-58, when two former East St. Louis prep stars, Turley, known as "Bullet Bob," and the late outfielder Hank Bauer participated with the New York Yankees in World Series games.

If it leaves the North Hunterdon Court, Franklin will be the latest to leave in an exodus that actually began about six years ago. That's when Tom Borkowski, who was then mayor of Clinton Township, sought a way to reallocate some court costs that he thought fell unfairly on his township. Borkowski wasn't successful, and when Nick Corcodilos replaced him as mayor in 2006, he continued the initiative. After Corcodilos similarly failed, the township bailed and formed its own court that opened at the start of 2008. Since then, Union Township closed its own court in favor of paying Clinton Township for use of the Clinton Township Municipal Court under an "inter-local" shared services agreement. Officials in both townships say the change reduced their costs.

Boston Celtics guard Ray Allen didn't play in Game 1 of the NBA playoffs against Atlanta. As expected, Coach Doc Rivers said that Allen wouldn't be in uniform because of an ailing right ankle. He had a cortisone shot last week and says the ankle is feeling better, but not enough to go in the playoff opener. Rivers says the status of the 36-year-old guard will be determined before each game. The coach isn't ruling out the possibility of Allen playing sometime in the series.
The argument echoes one made last month to Pohl by a First Amendment lawyer at Guantanamo in the case of Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, accused of orchestrating al-Qaida's October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole off Aden, Yemen.

The Franklin-McKinley district had not laid off a teacher in 15 years, according to Deputy Superintendent Rudy Herrera.

Since the last decade of the Cold War, I've chronicled the decline of autocrats in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Northern Africa, and know the early-warning signs. Russia's winter of civic awakening felt much like the first widespread pot-banging protests against Gen.

So, no -- what happened Monday wasn't enough to save Ohio State from the wrath of the NCAA. Nor should it be. Jim Tressel, and Tressel alone, was the guy who knew since April 2010 of violations involving some of his best players. That's true. But neither of the two people above him on the school hierarchy -- not his direct boss, not his school president -- thought what he'd done was bad enough to warrant his removal.
I know I have to make a decision, not on the bill as I would like to see it, but the bill as it is. My criticisms of the legislation have been well reported. I do not retract them. I incorporate them in this statement. They still stand as legitimate and cautionary. I still have doubts about the bill. I do not think it is a first step toward anything I have supported in the past. This is not the bill I wanted to support, even as I continue efforts until the last minute to modify the bill.

Chesapeake and other drillers have learned to tap enormous reserves of natural gas trapped in shale formations under several states using a controversial drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling.

When so much of life has become a global mashup, it is heartwarming to find a place that is so proudly English, but not stuffy or snobby. This is not pastiche; rather, it brings together the desires of Graham's English country-house upbringing with Braka's flair for mixing. "We wanted the Gunton Arms to become not just a destination but a genuine social focus for the area," says Braka. "And in a remarkably short time, it has."

But political leaders from both ends of Fulton County have been hostile to the referendum plan. The issues range from the MARTA tax — which is paid only in Fulton, DeKalb and the city of Atlanta, so some people there resent taking on another transportation tax — to why Fulton and DeKalb have only five votes on the 21-vote regional roundtable despite making up about 40 percent of the region’s population. The roundtable will pick the list of transportation projects for the referendum.
