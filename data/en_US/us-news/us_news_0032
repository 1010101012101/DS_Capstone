_ WILL WASHINGTON WIN THE NL EAST? All eyes are on Bryce Harper, Stephen Strasburg and the Nationals right now. They're fresh, fun and full of rising talent. Plus, they're winning minus injured closer Drew Storen. Manager Davey Johnson provides a steady hand, and the Nats will do OK while Jayson Werth's broken wrist heals. The last time a baseball team from the nation's capital reached the postseason was 1933, when FDR was in office. It might be time for President Barack Obama to begin warming up his left arm. The call: The Nats just miss the playoffs.
The issue centers on a type of federal loan reserved for undergraduate students. The interest rate on these subsidized Stafford loans is set to jump from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1.

It's a huge leap from "It's his life" to "It's his bedroom," though, one a lot of parents rightly don't feel comfortable making, even while acknowledging the practical absurdity of the result: "You have my blessing to sneak around and get a little wherever you can -- responsibly! -- without getting busted."

Ford said it's on track to break even or turn a profit in 2011. But the company isn't squeaky clean. It still has debt, an underfunded pension plan and a primary market -- the U.S. -- where consumers are skittish about buying a new car amid mounting job losses in a recession.

Which brings us back to the resolution. Rodriguez notes that Chicago has already hit its limit on the amount of taxes it can levy on sugary beverages (three percent so far) so the resolution could go into effect only if and when the state raised that limit.

Until 2008, Michigan's Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales didn't brew a pumpkin beer - somewhat ironic. La Parcela uses about 30 pounds of pumpkin for every 310 gallons of beer, but good luck picking out much pumpkin flavor.

The district would be responsible for 10 percent of the grant amount, $500,000.

If a summer program bills itself as providing new skills to participants, then make a point to learn about the background of the staff who will teach these skills. Are the program leaders teachers themselves or experts in a particular field? Also, inquire as to the training they receive.

DeMott entered prison in May 2007, sentenced to 23-60 months on four counts of attempted armed robbery, with credit for time served. It was a ridiculous sentence for a 15-year-old, as even then-MDOC health services administrator Lynda Zeller suggested: "It is unfortunate that Mr. DeMott was directed into prison at 15 years old rather than being retained in the juvenile justice system where more age-appropriate resources exist," Zeller wrote in an Oct. 20, 2008, confidential memo.

"There's a lot of speculation. And it doesn't matter. We're in this season, we played the games, we're in the playoffs now. Hopefully no one else goes down with these type of injuries," Miami's Dwyane Wade said. "It's not anything that we want to see for none of our players to go down with injuries. So you don't know. You don't know if it was because of the condensed season. You don't know what the case may be. The biggest thing is that them guys get healthy."

Hip pain is nothing new for Aldridge, which may explain his desire to seek a third medical opinion about his condition.

"The crew has to be super-vigilant. Imagine 1,500 miles of watching me and Julie ride a bike! And we're not going 60 miles per hour. We're going 10, or 15, or 20. Once we were waiting on a rider coming in and heard she was going three miles per hour at 3 in the morning. That's what she could do, so that meant her crew's car, right behind her, was going three miles per hour as well."

Meet the new face of the food cart revolution: Roving gastro-trucks that mash up ethnic cuisines, pop culture and affordability, then post their ever-shifting locations to a wired clientele through Twitter and Web sites. In Portland that means Koi Fusion, which launched in June when business grad Bo Kwon hit the streets in an $80,000 food truck with a spicy mix of Korean barbecue tacos, kimchi quesadillas and Korean fries. Now Kwon draws followers on the command of a tweet -- often to PGE Park or PSU but also renegade spots. And wherever Koi lands, the feel is of an instant party, fed by a communal condiment station and a great playlist. (Watch video here.)

Here he is in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11: "We are apparently supposed to shut up and eat our spinach. Asking questions, proposing alternatives, making distinctions, arguing analogies, remembering history, or criticizing our stand-tall President is, for the moment, unpatriotic and maybe even unmanly. Wave that flag, stuff that qualm." And yet, even in that moment, he can't stop looking to the writers, to literature as a counter-force. "Grace Paley, on the other wonderful hand," he enthuses a few lines later, "suggests … that we bomb Afghanistan with three tons of wheat, rye, and rice, since they are starving: 'If we do it with a vicious attitude, maybe that will be enough for some people.'"

But by the 1980s, led by Clyde Barker at Penn and Paul Lacy at Washington University in St. Louis, researchers began experimenting with transplanting cells rather than the entire organ.

As hard as it can be to get kids to eat veggies, I find that salads can often be a loophole in a child's "no-veggie" policy. What's not to love? They're fresh, colorful and often packed with different textures and flavors. Now that spring is here, there's no better way to take advantage of local produce than to showcase it in a salad.

There is no starker example of how Democrats on the San Diego City Council put public employees ahead of the public than in how they have blocked implementation of a 2006 "managed competition" ballot initiative allowing the city to provide some services using less expensive private providers. The measure won by a 60 percent to 40 percent landslide. In an era of constant budget headaches, the opportunities it provides to save money are immense and need to be pursued.

Since our parents died, my brothers and I have invented our own ways to spend special occasions. Sometimes we take trips at Christmas, as this seems like a better gift than anything else we could buy. Last Christmas, we went to California's Big Sur.

Santa Barbara was once known as a “city of books,” where a page-turning tourist could spend days prowling the stacks of small and large stores. The massive Earthling Bookstore was the progenitor of the bookstore-as-meeting place style later embraced by the chains. It was one of the first to fall victim to the big-box bookstores (though perhaps overly optimistic expansion plans had as much to do with its collapse).

This summer I went to three cities that capture a part of Russia's spirit: Moscow, the modern capital; St. Petersburg, the city of the czars and the place the Russian Revolution began; and Khabarovsk, the capital of the Russian Far East. Each city shows how post-Soviet society is on the search for a new self-identity.

But with time winding down in the period, North senior forward Nick Edwards slid a pass back to Rivenburgh at the right point. South second-period goalie Kodiak White (Belleville West) made the save, but the puck bounced up into the air.
Hungary's prime minister launched a scathing attack on the European Union on Thursday, accusing it of colonialist behavior, disrespecting his country's sovereignty and meddling in its domestic affairs.
After intermission the orchestra performed the Symphony No. 2 by Jean Sibelius. This popular symphony is deceptive. It requires a particular kind of mental virtuosity from a conductor because the work is built from discontinuities. Gerard Schwarz made the edges of the fragments sharp by observing strict silences and by not taking time between musical gestures. The layered expression of these broken fragments in the development, and their simultaneous combination during the recapitulation were balanced with great care and they made an impressive impact.
Edwards is accused of deliberately using the money to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008. Edwards denies the charges, and his attorneys have said the Youngs spent the money on their dream house.

If the formal Notice of Allegations were sent, then an in-person hearing in front of the committee would occur.

Readers also have to wade through some score-settling. Bastianich has less than nice things to say about one wine importer, a genius gelato maker and people in the fashion business.

In class, she studied the issue of rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Then she worked on the Institute's exhibit, "Congo/Women: Portraits of War," which examined the scourge of sexual violence against women and toured 20 U.S. cities. The experience put academic theory into action, she said. The Institute "showed me that being quiet isn't going to make change. You have to use your voice out in the world."
Because the film moves between so many time periods as it fills in the past, the task for production and costume crews, headed by Simon Elliott ("Bleak House") and Consolata Boyle ("Angela's Ashes," "Into the West") respectively, was substantial as well, and the effects do an excellent job at making the various eras distinct. Director of photography Elliot Davis ("Out of Sight," "Twilight") keeps the look throughout very clean. Together, they create the sense of a well-managed and carefully manicured life where nothing seems frivolous. Things are in their place. Even the children — or so you sense, when Thatcher's daughter Carol (Olivia Colman) drops by to check on Mum, keeping her frustration in check.
"One of the things Congress hates to do is to get in the middle of a fight," says Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "If you get more consensus around something, it seems to increase the chances that Congress will pass a bill."

Rita Crundwell, 59, who had served as comptroller of Dixon, Illinois since 1983, used the money to buy three homes, more than a dozen cars, trucks and other vehicles, and to invest in a horse farm that has 311 quarter horses, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago said.
The auxiliary feedwater pump is used to supply water to the plant's steam generators during some accident conditions, the NRC said.
There’s kink, but no real kick, to this story of Freud, Jung and the birth of psychoanalysis, and their arguments over sexy patient Keira Knightley. Give Knightley points for being unashamed — of her nudity, or her overacting — but while Viggo Mortensen is a surprisingly droll Freud, Michael Fassbender is dull at Jung, and the whole thing feels a little dusty. “A Dangerous Method” may be David Cronenberg’s most accessible film. But who wants David Cronenberg to be accessible? What was always exciting about him was his utter, difficult singularity.
The fear of another destructive attack that might target information technology, or IT, forced companies to hustle to upgrade their security software.

But Ortman said the district has long needed an online option for students.
Gas tax funding for the Highway Patrol was phased out over several years and a series of fees were established in last year's transportation bill to make up for the lost money.

It "would have decimated the ability to do the work that we already do," he said. DeWolfe said he supports the concept, but providing counsel for initial hearings cannot be carried out without substantially more resources.
I complained when the sweet but conventional "In the Heights" beat out the astringently fresh "Passing Strange" in 2008 and when the Lee Hall- Elton John juggernaut "Billy Elliot" upstaged the far more dramatically daring "Next to Normal" in 2009. This year, let me reverse course and congratulate Tony voters for their dogged consistency. In a world that has become violently unpredictable, "Broadway's biggest night" never fails to live up to its staid reputation — so what if it poisons the creative well for the next decade.
"What it does is tell me that going on strike over a clause in their contract may not be the real reason they're striking," said Roach, an airline pilot who is himself a union member.

David Breskin recruited Frisell for the Richter project because he sensed parallels between the painter and the guitarist.

All that notwithstanding, it is a strange time in history for self-appointed advocates for women to feel oppressed on their behalf. They must have missed the growing literature on "The End of Men" and similar themes. Women earn about 60 percent of bachelor's and master's degrees, and are reaching parity with men in medical and law schools. Their attitudes to work are changing. In a historic reversal, more young women ages 18 to 34 (66 percent) than young men (59 percent) say high-paying work is one of the most important things or very important, according to a new Pew survey.

Even more suspicious, Addison had an alibi the day Holly disappeared -- he had been bitten by a wild dog hiking on Mount Hood and was in the hospital. Ah, but what hospital? Beaverton Community Hospital! Why drive all the way to Beaverton when you're in terrible pain, Hank wonders. Poor Beaverton -- dissed again.

On the roster: It's one of the strongest, deepest positions on the team, but don't be surprised if the Lions draft a defensive lineman early. Cliff Avril hasn't signed his franchise tender and is a fair bet to leave in free agency without a long-term deal. Kyle Vanden Bosch turns 34 in November, and Lawrence Jackson, who has played 11 games each of the last two years, is a potential free agent. The Lions drafted first-round defensive tackles each of the last two years and have more stability at the position, though Sammie Hill and Corey Williams can both be free agents after the season.

Diabetes: Twenty studies worldwide show that coffee, both regular and decaf, lowers the risk for Type 2 diabetes, in some studies by as much as 50%. Researchers say that is probably because chlorogenic acid, one of the many ingredients in coffee, slows uptake of glucose (sugar) from the intestines. (Excess sugar in the blood is a hallmark of diabetes.) Chlorogenic acid may also stimulate GLP-1, a chemical that boosts insulin, the hormone that escorts sugar from the blood into cells. Yet another ingredient, trigonelline, a precursor to vitamin B3, may help slow glucose absorption.
