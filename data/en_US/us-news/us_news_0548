Break-in: Police are investigating a burglary at Castille Elementary School in which game systems were taken from YMCA classrooms and a teacher's laptop was stolen from a portable classroom, according to Principal Laura Lyon. The break-in happened over spring break, Lyon said in an email to parents. A similar burglary occurred two months ago at Carl Hankey K-8 School.

“Because of the president’s concerns about the crimes Daqduq is alleged to have committed, we worked a wide range of options consistent with U.S. and Iraqi law to effect his transfer to a U.S. military commission. We did so because we felt that was the fastest possible way to bring him to justice. We are continuing to discuss this case with the Iraqis, and as of this morning, he has been transferred to Iraqi custody,” said Tommy Vietor, spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement.

Once I got to the turnoff for the Apple Farm in Philo—which along with an opulent orchard is home to a cooking school I'd attended a couple of years ago—I knew I wasn't too far from Handley Cellars. The winery sits at the base of Holmes Ranch, where a cluster of historic wood buildings remains—the barn and water tower, as well as the ranch house where I'd be staying. I arrived just as the light began to wane, and there was Handley herself, a silhouette with flapping skirt, waiting at the wide curve of the drive with the key. The apartment—decorated with folk art from around the world, the beds covered with handmade quilts—overlooks one of the winery's working vineyards. There was a bowl of fruit on the dining-room table, and fresh coffee beans (and a grinder) on the kitchen counter, as well as a loaf of local Bruce Bread—deep brown, studded with raisins and nuts—for morning toast. All touches that said: Make yourself at home.

As awareness of PTSD, TBI and other "invisible wounds" of war has increased in the past several years, civilian courts have responded by setting up diversion programs to get eligible veterans into treatment, rather than locking them up. Seamone says nearly 100 of these so-called "veterans courts" have already been established, and another 100 or so are in the works.

Some asylum-seekers must be locked up while they are screened. Those who seek protection often have fled their home countries with little or relied on false documents to escape, meaning that they would be difficult to find again if allowed to go free. Establishing the veracity of someone's identity can take time. In such cases, detention while awaiting a hearing is justified.

Efforts to “subvert the genre” don’t go very far. For instance, we learn at the start that the students, despite being good-looking, are really smart, but the detail winds up yielding nothing. Moreover, none of the young people in the cast (the jock is played by “Thor” star Chris Hemsworth) manages to make his or her character memorable, with one exception. Fran Kranz, the guy who plays a comedy-relief stoner who sees secret patterns in the universe, turns in a performance so annoying that if you multiplied 1960s Jerry Lewis by 1990s Pauly Shore, you’d still be only halfway there.

But because the 2010 Fair Districts anti-gerrymandering overhaul only prohibits lawmakers from "intentionally" favoring one party over another, proving that Republicans gerrymandered to preserve their majorities will be a heavy lift. And Republicans insist they followed the law.
But the United Center crowd was having none of his postseasonal depression Tuesday night. The fans had saved their lungs for just this moment. They wanted him to know how they felt about him three days after he and they had heard some of the worst news imaginable for the Bulls.

The final payout for consumers who signed up for the company's vehicle service contracts or engine additive warranties will depend upon how many file claims. They may be prioritized, beginning with those victimized by unauthorized bank withdrawals or who canceled contracts but got no refunds. Next in line would be those promised that if they paid in full and made no repair claims, they would get a full refund.
Public debate on this matter often coalesces in one form or another around the idea of laziness -- referring either to the students or to their teachers. Such interpretations seem superficial and inadequate.

"It's not just the cost in a vacuum," said Shari Silberstein, executive director of Equal Justice USA, a national grass-roots organization that opposes the death penalty. "It's not to say that if it was a good economic time, we'd be supporting it. But people are weighing the cost … and realizing that the death penalty is a very ineffective way to keep the public safe, especially for the money."

The prosecutor said Gonzalez “testified during trial and denied selling alcohol, but the jury was very attentive and simply did not believe his testimony.”
James, there may be another reason for Israeli leaders' reticence about their Gaza objectives: Those objectives are illegal under international law. Had even Israel's claim of self-defense over the rockets been justified, self-defense is a limited right and only authorizes such force as is necessary to redress the harm suffered by the state invoking it. The objectives you outline -- uprooting Hamas, destroying its infrastructure and so on -- are political, not military, objectives and exceed the scope of legitimate self-defense. Armed attacks not justified by self-defense constitute crimes against international peace.
The game tries to cater to several play styles from air combat to close-quarters fighting on the ground. With three factions, each with special units and traits, there's still going to be that variety in units that hard-core fans crave.

But Moyer was not as chipper with reporters, twice saying, "I'd rather talk about the game" when asked about his new role and how he's dealt with the demotion. Manuel said he did not think that Moyer went out last night with a chip on his shoulder, but the lefty clearly is still simmering about being ousted from the rotation. He had last pitched in relief on June 24, 2004 for Seattle.

Low-rank baboons took my presence as an opportunity to take advantage of someone. They seemed particularly to enjoy landing on my head and pulling out my hair, especially one low-rank female who never stopped trying. Others, with their friendly lip-smack greeting, seemed to like me from the start - yet didn't respect me. It took time and persistence to earn any sort of respect.

The governor who had seemed a little off pitch when he asked Californians of the 1970s to prepare for an era of diminished expectations seemed perfectly rational now. No one flinched when he promised to deliver a "tough budget for tough times" - and that the necessary cuts could not be achieved by attacking waste and inefficiency.
State Sen. Kevin O’Toole (R-Essex) said it was "curious" that Democrats wanted to reopen a civil case that was settled with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn. "What’s next they ask for his green card to make sure he came over here legally?" O’Toole said.

Back to the new poll: 34 percent of voters say they approve of the way Portman is handling his job as a U.S. senator, and 16 percent disapprove. There is hope in these numbers, because a healthy 51 percent said they just don't know. Considering that so far, Portman's only official act as a senator was his swearing-in -- after which the Senate took a break (it'll come back next week) -- we go back to our original point: It's awfully early.

There have been changes in some of the other families as well. The Targaryens are now absent one significant family member, the unrelentingly evil Viserys (Harry Lloyd), who got a fatal gilding last season (not to be confused with fatal geldings, of which there are a few in "Game of Thrones"). Now his sister, Daenarys (Emilia Clarke), is leading her people through the expansive Red Waste, still intent on winning back her late father's throne.

Of course, the most important test lies ahead, when a successful march through the postseason will almost certainly require greater support than Rose received during last year against Miami.

If the Broncos make a trade on the first day of the draft, I see them hoping for a quality player to fall in the first round who gives them the opportunity to move back into the top of the second round. There will be players with first-round grades still sitting there when the second round opens, and if the Broncos have a grouping of players from No. 25 to No. 34 or so, they gladly move back slightly if they get the chance.

Prosecutors are now trying to set up a face-to-face meeting with the alleged victim, said Sally Daly, spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's office.

We paid $7 an adult, plus $4 for Ediza, to enter and drive the three miles to Agnew Meadows. If arriving at the entrance station between 7 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., most visitors are required to take the shuttle bus to limit traffic on the narrow road.

I guess the biggest difference so far comes off the field, in comments made to the media. Last September, La Russa refused to take off a necklace given to him by Santana when the team started winning. La Russa was famous for changing the writing style on his lineup card based on whether or not the team won the day before. Last season, he wrote out the card in block print and lost, wrote the card in cursive and lost, and finally mixed the two – cursive one name, block the next – and won. This past weekend, Matheny explained his superstition: "My only superstition is not to be superstitious." That's different.

1- Read the fine print. I had a $20 national movie chain gift card shrink to a small tub of popcorn because I didn’t redeem it within an allotted window. While most national retailers have done away with time limits, be wary of bank, mall, eatery and credit card company cards, which are more likely to add expiration dates and tack on annoying fees for activation, inactivity, maintenance, and transactions. Hopefully your benefactor did due diligence before purchasing your card, but take the time to peruse the tiny type, paying close attention to expiration dates or clauses that could alter value. If you plan on holding on to your card for a while, it’s helpful to use a permanent marker to write any expiration dates on the front.

Massive consolidation in the manufacturing of generic drugs is the primary cause. Where there used to be five manufacturers of a particular drug now there may be one or two.

Terri Juergens (noted in Lepeltak's article) was Natalia's first basketball coach for the very first third-grade girls team at St. Peter CYO, followed by Jim Connors, assisted by first Harry Ewing, then Steve Barros for fourth through eighth grade. Jim and Steve built a very strong foundation for all the players. A focus on team play was very much on Jim's agenda, and Natalia took it to heart. From the very beginning, Natalia developed as a real team player. It's quite a good feeling to know that some of her CYO teammates were also part of the second CCS Championship team from Terra Nova — Julie Gerughty and Tiffany Gustafson — great kids that she grew up with in Pacifica.

øUnderwood explores a lot on her new album, Blown Away, out this week. While some of its 14 tracks are among the countriest country she has ever recorded, it's also the kind of album that could broaden her fan base. The album's songs range from the dark drama of the title track and Two Black Cadillacs to the summery pop-country of One Way Ticket, from Who Are You, penned by rock hitmaker (and Shania Twain's ex-husband) Mutt Lange, to the throwback twang of Cupid'sGot a Shotgun, which features a guitar solo by friend and Country Music Association Awards co-host Brad Paisley.

I still keep a little orange square of bright nylon fabric from when he festooned Central Park in 2005. It might not be art, but it's a token of art.

How did director William A. Wellman and crew get those dizzying aerial shots? This was before CGI, folks.

There is a mystique about point guards in the NBA these days. They are, the Magic Johnson precedent aside, usually not 6-feet-8, but closer to average tall-ish guy size.

What if your favorite place to buy a coffee was expected by the state, without being compensated, to sell a new product that may provide a more effective caffeine-fueled energy boost than their specially grown and brewed, traditional coffee beverages. Or, worse yet, what if your favorite coffee place had to carve out shelf space for a product not on the market yet, but will be – maybe, someday? Outrageous, unfair, right? Government can't make a store sell something – or can it?

Playing much earlier in the day was Tiger Woods, who began his round hoping to make up at least some part of an eight-shot deficit. After an even-par round in which he couldnt control his swing, he was exactly where he started  3-over par and needing the leaders to move backward over the remainder of the day.

My most special memory of Hiram is a very personal one, and also one to which all others pale in comparison.

Checking accounts fleeced — A Culver City man has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for his role in a sophisticated scheme that stripped more than $1.6 million from Wells Fargo & Co. checking accounts. Sean Bazille, 45, was convicted of charges that included conspiracy and bank fraud. He is one of 17 people convicted in the scam. The scheme’s organizers paid Wells Fargo employees to provide account holder information, then used it to produce and cash bogus checks, the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles said in a news release. They also had bank employees change customers’ telephone numbers on file with the bank so that someone involved in the scam would answer the phone if the bank called to inquire about suspicious activity. Wells Fargo has modified its procedures so that this tactic won’t work anymore, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. More than 100 customer accounts were compromised during the fraud, which ran from 2002 to 2006. Wells Fargo replaced the stolen money to customer accounts, incurring a loss of $1.66 million, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. This case is an example of why it’s important for bank account holders to carefully check monthly statements for mistakes or fraud.

Take a deep breath, even if it's through your mouth, and do this: Wash out your nose with a neti pot (from your drugstore). It looks like a genie lamp. Just fill it with saltwater and rinse your sinuses, pouring the water in one nostril and letting it run out the other. If you've never tried this, it sounds weird, but it's not uncomfortable. And it works.
