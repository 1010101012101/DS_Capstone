The Senate's bill instructs regulators to study how the rule could be changed and put into place. But Senate Democrats readied a proposal by Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Carl Levin of Michigan that would ditch that discretion for regulators. They also would prohibit banks from betting against investments they assemble for clients, a reaction to the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against Goldman Sachs.

Real estate agents are known to quote the benefits of "location, location, location," and in Montclair, that means Church Street. Yes, the parking is impossible, but the single block buzzes with well-heeled shoppers and diners no matter what time of day, day of the week, or weather, and there's also live music on weekends. "Meet me on Church Street" says it all.

McNutt, who first read Martin's books when he was a teenager, compares sexposition to computer animation that illustrates the path of a bullet through a body on "CSI." In both cases, the aim is to "provide visual stimulus," though with the sex scenes, the information being learned is not necessarily related to the racy action. On shows where explicit sex is not permitted, like on basic cable, he says, the sexposition might occur while two characters are laying in bed.

But Obama's compromise is likely to be popular among independents, and that has to matter almost as much for the president. After all, last month's election confirmed an ancient lesson in American politics: Most campaigns are won in the center, among independent and swing voters who are neither reliably liberal nor deeply conservative.

Sanchez and Ramirez said they also decided against Mexico because of the lack of good-paying jobs there. Sanchez made $9.80 an hour working for a landscaping company in the West Valley, a low wage by American standards but middle-class by Mexican standards. In Pennsylvania, Sanchez is working for his brother, who owns a small landscaping business. He is getting paid more, $10 an hour, but working fewer hours, 28 instead of 40. But he said that the money is still better than what he would earn in Mexico and that he hopes to be working more hours once they can get more lawn jobs.

Not only would it further divide the haves -- the elite-level passengers who are already granted every amenity they desire -- and the have-nots crammed into the steerage section, but it also sends a problematic message from the government to air travelers: If you want us to trust you, it'll cost you.

The problem is that saying "I'm a geek lol!" is not the same as saying "I'm a doctor (lol)!" Geek is an ambiguous cultural distinction. It doesn't correlate to, as Brown's article contends, specialized skill or knowledge. There is no geek union, no entrance exam, no ongoing certification program to abide by.

Occupy Wall Street has initiated a national debate about poverty and inequality that resembles the political turmoil of the Gilded Age of the 1890s and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Can democracy and the nation's economic health continue to survive severe disparities of income and well-being? Central cities, like Cleveland, reflect the downward spiral of income for working-class and minority families. More than 40 percent of its households live in poverty.

There is nothing new about this. Shock-rap is at least as old as Schoolly D’s "P.S.K. What Does it Mean?," which introduced the world to gangster storytelling in 1985. Those of us who are old enough will remember the controversy that surrounded N.W.A., the late-’80s group of rappers who flaunted their moral irresponsibility on record. Around the time of the L.A. riots, folksinger Michelle Shocked took to the newspapers to condemn N.W.A. for peddling a violent, misogynist stereotype to a mostly white audience. In 2011, Odd Future is handling, or ignoring, criticism that feels nearly identical. Their Shocked is Sara Quin of pop-rockers Tegan and Sara, who roasted Odd Future and the record industry supporting the act for trivializing rape and homophobia.

Not all rappers have been drawn to the poet. But those interested in extending the legacy of social engagement through music invariably turned to Gil Scott-Heron's records for inspiration, and often much more. De La Soul sampled "The Bottle," Chuck D of Public Enemy occasionally mimicked Heron's delivery, Dr. Dre and RBX quoted him at length on "Blunt Time." And Kanye West devoted the entire final track of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" to a re-framing of Scott-Heron's "Comment No.1," first recorded on "Small Talk," all the way back in 1970. "Who will survive in America?," Scott-Heron asked, over and over. It's a question that remains as relevant today as it was when he first posed it.

Remarkable, how secluded a spot can feel yet sit just a stone's throw from the bustle of Detroit Avenue. There's a striking sense of escape from urban mayhem as you enter Three Birds from its spacious back parking lot; the subtly designed rear lobby gives way to the splashy sophistication of the dining room's eclectic vibe, incorporating exposed brick, warm and intense colors, and dramatic artistic and architectural flourishes. The space affords a comfortable balance between see-and-be-seen and cozy tete-a-tete. Most of all, whatever your intention, it's a place for some terrific food. The menu changes seasonally, so not all items we sampled may be available if you visit.

But skeptics – who have come to include prominent conservative print, TV and radio commentators – have been fueled by the dissenting scientists and by incidents like the 2010 email brouhaha which initially seemed to indicate that climate researchers at England's University of East Anglia doctored data. Six official inquiries cleared the scientists of misconduct, but the incident sowed further seeds of doubt.

That planning-aversive decision is only one of a number of ways "Rachel Getting Married" could have gone off the rails. Lumet's script could have come off as too melodramatic, and Demme's decision to fill the film with people he knows (including his son Brooklyn Demme as a guitar player) could have made the proceedings seem like a home movie in the worst way.

What’s something people might not know about you? I’ve always wanted to be a teacher since I was a little girl. I used to “play school” with all my dolls. One thing I learned just several years ago is that the day I was born, my Dad, Ronald Zeck, Sr. looked at my hands and said to my Mom, Patricia Zeck, “She has piano fingers and will one day be a teacher.” He spoke and it came to pass! There are several Zeck teachers in my family. Also, I sing and oversee the Children’s Ministry at my church. I’ve taken dance and piano lessons. I love to travel! It affords lots of examples to be used for teaching! Visiting the Caribbean, Europe, Alaska, and Family in the U.S. are some of my favorite trips!

Each chamber has a particular theme. One is devoted to political philosophy, as if the inhabitants were boning up on how to launch a new, post-apocalyptic society.

A long-lost Rubens painting turns up, and suddenly Roger is on the receiving end of many bad things. The incidents pop off like a string of firecrackers. He takes such a pounding that "Headhunters" reaches an almost Coenesque level of surreal cruelty, and I found the whole affair much more fun than the various films derived from Stieg Larsson's novels. (Ironically, the Swedish production company Yellow Bird, which co-produced this film, also produced the movies made from Larsson's Millennium trilogy.)

Conversely, I find flour to be the perfect thickener for a nectarine pie. I combine the fruit with a touch of almond extract (almonds go well with stone fruit) and just enough sugar to lightly sweeten, then top it with a sweet almond crumble. The flour gives the filling a soft, almost creamy feel and matches perfectly with the bright, almost lemony notes of the nectarines.

If given the opportunity to participate and have meaningful input, I know city employees will be constructive and responsible.

So we were in the Capital together and there was a rivalry then. I’m quite sure they know the record, so I’m sure they’re excited to have the opportunity to beat Goucher. And when you put being in the Final Four for the Landmark on top of that, they’re playing for a lot. They’re going to be very motivated.”

Hey, Todd: Steelers GM Kevin Colbert said at the combine that he wants Wallace to finish his career in Pittsburgh.

That seems to be the prevailing sentiment for Campbell and the Goodbye Tour, especially (but not exclusively) among baby boomers, who are taking the chance to appreciate one of their generation's heroes while they have the chance, a chance that isn't always anticipated.

Pig ears and pig trotters come out of the nose to tail eating philosophy that's driving the Tasting Kitchen, Salt's Cure and Animal, to name just a few restaurants that are serious about butchering. For diners, it isn't just about putting more notches on your adventurous eating belt, or seeing how much you can gross out your vegan boyfriend. It's about knowing where the animal comes from, that it was raised humanely, and if it's slaughtered for food, giving it all due respect by utilizing every part of the beast.

I am currently receiving extended benefits, but they are set to expire at the end of my current tier. Will that change under the new legislation?
I recognize the sense of compassion that drives this argument, but I believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. It would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration.

The department budget is double what it was when Kent was hired. And failing to be nationally relevant isn't acceptable from a program that should aspire to be more than a perennial question mark.
Greg Cote, Miami Herald: "Just as the Heat risked big thinking that superstar egos could mesh and eventually harmonize, so the Marlins are gambling that this roster - led by the most refreshingly outspoken and unfiltered manager in baseball - will enjoy tranquility. This team could come together and be brilliant, or it could come loose and be chaos. The man in charge of that is the manager.

Despite all this, roughly two-thirds of the crowds on Sunday also showed up on Saturday. Why? Well for those of you in the media that have utterly ignored the Le Mans, multi-class racing, it's because there are a lot of passes, a lot of clashes, a lot of differences, that made sure no one who had the pole finished there in any of the classes.

Instead of delaying contracts, it's time for elected officials to pull the plug.

This spring, Gliha leads a track team that is a serious contender to win another state championship. He is developing enough speed to contend in shorter distances, which means he could score points in more events at the state meet. It also places added pressure on him as a team leader.

They certainly didn't do that on Tuesday night, squandering a 4-1 lead in a Yankee comeback that featured what amounted to a two-run error by third baseman Mark Reynolds.

“That’s their right, and I’m okay with it,” Christie said at today’s gathering, his eighth town-hall meeting this year. “The real question now is not if we change the pension system, but how we change it. If we don’t, it will go belly up.”
Burk's beef with Augusta National is that its membership is open only to men. In 2002, her campaign to stage a protest at the club and promote a boycott of sponsors fizzled. Augusta National held its ground and demonstrated its independence by televising the event sponsor-free in 2003 and 2004.

Often drowned out by U.S. criticism of Chinese trade and currency policy is Beijing's drumbeat for access to more cutting-edge U.S. computers, communication systems and composite materials. China says it wants these technologies for commercial uses, but U.S. authorities ban export of technology to China that has the potential to strengthen its military because of Washington's long-standing arms embargo against China.

10. General manager Phil Emery talked about restructuring the front office and adding additional staff when he was hired. But he said those moves would come after the draft. Expect some movement soon. Sources say Emery likely will promote from within to create the roles of pro personnel director and college scouting director. Then, he would have to add staff to replace those scouts in their current roles. It’s also possible some entry-level scouts will be added to the mix. But the entire staff is coming out of contract, as reported by the Tribune in January. That means assistant director of pro personnel Kevin Turks and pro assistant James Kirkland will be scouting free agents. The same can be said for the six college area scouts: Chris Ballard, Marty Barrett, Rex Hogan, Ted Monago, Mark Sadowski and Jeff Shiver. In the past, the Bears rotated contracts with their college scouts on two-year deals so three were up one year and three were up the next. The club re-signed scouts last May to one-year contracts using the NFL lockout as an excuse.

1. Rich Crotty. The Orange County mayor topped this list last year, too. We can start with his position. He controls a budget of $2.5 billion and 6,000 employees. But more importantly, he has been a go-to guy on virtually every major community effort, from a new NBA arena to changing the face of Central Florida's low-paying economy -- though it's worth noting that neither of those efforts have been completed. Crotty, 57, rarely engages in high-profile fights with others, preferring instead to work things out behind the scenes. And in the handful of cases where he has butted heads, such as last year's budget battle with Sheriff Kevin Beary, public opinion was on his side. Put his demeanor, resources and 27 years of holding public offices all together, and you have a man whose blessings can make or break a dream.

Exercise may also dramatically cut risk of depression, heart disease, osteoporosis and Type 2 diabetes in people over 65 while also being first-line treatment for those and other costly diseases (Journal of the American Medical Association 2002, 2006; American Journal of Cardiology 2003; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008). The American College of Sports Medicine clearly states older adults should engage in strength training, endurance exercise and stretching for 150 minutes per week to maintain a high quality of life (2009). Note that walking is not enough – you need to incorporate strengthening exercise, too.
Engineers also planned to begin injecting nitrogen gas into reactors No. 1, 2 and 3 in an attempt to prevent possible explosions from the buildup of hydrogen gas. Explosions at the three reactors in the first four days after the magnitude 9 earthquake and accompanying tsunami March 11 badly damaged the reactor buildings and disabled the cooling pumps that provided water to the reactors. Government officials say it may take months to fully restore the cooling systems.

We're also troubled by Holder's assertion that the administration is free to target anyone it deems to be a terrorist, on the soil of any country it considers "unable or unwilling to deal effectively with a threat to the United States." We have to wonder how supporters of this position would feel if another country such as China or Russia were to take this approach in killing its enemies around the world. And we're more than a little disappointed at the way Democrats (including Holder and President Obama) who criticized President Bush's broad assertions of presidential powers in the war on terrorism have changed their tune now that a Democrat is in the White House.

øThis worked well for the most part - for both long drives and short putts - though I found it strange to face the television during your stance when your onscreen golfer is standing sideways. Until you get used to it, gamers might be inclined to stand in front of the TV with their left or right shoulder facing the television, just like the golf pro you're emulating. Along with this visual disconnect, navigating through menus with your hands proved quite complicated; EA Sports could've done a better job at this, so you might find yourself using the voice option to say out loud what you'd like to do.

Reports of sudden acceleration in Toyota vehicles has resulted in nine federal inquiries and investigations since 2000, two of which determined that there were improperly positioned floor mats. Another found a loose part in Sienna minivans, and yet another probe remains open. The rest were dismissed with no findings of equipment problems.
Starting in December 2008, similar problems were reported in Europe with the Aygo and Yaris models. Toyota said it lengthened a part and changed the material to fix the problem, starting in August 2009.

The Four Firkins even has a Minnesota beer history museum inside, which draws a lot of attention especially from new customers. Alvey, as he is known by most, is usually on duty greeting his customers, often referring to them as “mates” and can be heard telling them stories or sharing a laugh. The non-elitist attitude is welcoming, especially to new comers. According to Alvey, “We often say that we are not ‘beer snobs,’ we are ‘beer geeks,’ that is to say we want you to enjoy good beer as much as we do.”

But this isn't about seeking greener pastures. The move, J.J.'s father George Husar says, is saving a family struggling to make ends meet about $1,000 a month.

If anyone out there thinks that all rosés are sweet, please let me dispel that notion. Just because they can be as pink as bubble gum or cotton candy does not make them white Zinfandels. Rosés can be dry, crisp and citrusy. In fact, they are some of the most refreshing wines you can sip on a hot summer afternoon.

Both of my children take honors and AP classes. With proposed average class sizes of 35 at the high school level, I worry that both teachers and students will struggle to meet the demands of advanced curriculum. I cannot speak for parents whose children struggle in school, I only know that if I worry about my children getting the help they need and deserve, then other parents must have much deeper concerns. Looking at the proposed cuts from a different angle, as a real estate broker, I question how school cuts will affect property values.

Possibly, Butler gets more attractive recruits in the future. (Purdue was the runner-up for Hayward.) But will the glitzy recruits be of the one-and-done variety? Will they be the kind of "at-risk" kids who have off-court incidents? That kills the "team" story.

Despite investigations by the Los Angeles Police Department and the FBI, the case remains unsolved.

Those who believe in God will define the world "blessing" to mean an act of divine providence, or a gift from God. Those who don't believe in God can see these as results of hard work or good fortune. The sense of gratitude exists in either case.
