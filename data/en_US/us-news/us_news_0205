For the punter, it’s a matter of simple arithmetic when he challenges the speed traps: When you’re late for a Coughlin Appointment, you’re hit with a $1,500 fine per minute, with the penalty capping out at $5,000; even if you’re caught by the cops and make your meeting on time, you’re talking about a high risk-reward ratio.

The state's Democratic governor, Beverly Perdue, is so unpopular--her job approval has been fluctuating from 30 percent to 40 percent for months--that she wisely decided not to seek re-election this year. . . . Virtually everyone expects former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory (R), who lost to Perdue narrowly four years ago, to win the state's top office in November. . . . Two weeks ago, the state party's executive director, Jay Parmley, resigned amid accusations of sexual harassment. North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman David Parker, who accepted Parmley's resignation but seemed to defend him, has also come under fire. Some Democratic activists are now demanding his resignation.

So it's no surprise that our love affair with desserts has carried over from the plate to the glass, and not just in the form of a milkshake. If you prefer your after-dinner treat to come in liquid form but don't want to leave your sweet tooth unsatisfied, you have plenty of choices. And because we love multitasking, these drinks also serve as cocktails. Here are a few recipes. Keep in mind that dessert drinks at restaurants are often fairly strong, so even if they're meant for one, you'll still feel the alcohol if you share.

Von Saher, who lives in Connecticut, contends that the "Adam and Eve" diptych that has hung in the Pasadena museum since the late 1970s remains stolen goods.

Kitschy jewelry and apparel shops line the canals, most of the restaurants feature outdoor seating, and boat tours show off the seaside town created by architect Francois Spoerry in the 1960s. A sandy beach is also the ideal spot to rest after a long week.

Boyle, who did not return the candidate questionnaire, has been endorsed by the Downers Grove Township Republican Organization. According to her campaign website, if elected, like Sandack, she would decline the health care and pension benefits afforded to state legislators. Sandack has refused those benefits in his current position, as well. She also pledges to reinstate the death penalty for the "most heinous criminals." Like her opponent, she supports Senate Bill 512, which would create a three-tier pension system for current public employees as an incremental step towards solving Illinois' pension crisis. She wants to abolish legislative scholarships and eliminate government favoritism and "advocate for a level playing field" for all businesses.

A red ale also acquires a robust character from the caramelized malt, a quality often compared to that of red wine. By this formula, I propose looking at red ales as a perfect synthesis of beer styles, with all the flavor intensity of a richer, darker ale but also the crisp, hoppy finish of a blonder beer.

The election ordeal epitomizes the erratic nature of Egyptian politics as the nation has emerged from the overthrow of Mubarak to months of military rule marred by violent protests. Egyptians yearn for new leadership, but the rebellion has failed to summon a galvanizing voice and vision. Lacking political savvy and direction, young activists were pushed aside, setting up a battle between Islamists and holdovers from the old government.

Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, also noted the decreases in the percentage of people with employer-provided insurance in 2008 for the eighth year in a row.

Another re-enactment film, "Ammunition Smuggling on the Mexican Border" (1914), bills itself as an "accurate reproduction" of a bloody incident that had transpired a few months earlier involving Texas lawmen and Mexican revolutionaries. Attuned to the mythmaking power of movies, sheriff Eugene Buck, who produced the film and appears in it (as do several of the participants), conceived of it as an elaboration of his testimony on the witness stand.
The new contract could extend reliance on Russia even longer while serving as a painful metaphor for the state of NASA in the post-shuttle age. The agency that beat Russia to the moon now is entirely dependent on Roscosmos — and its nearly 50-year-old Soyuz rocket —- to get its people to low Earth orbit.

"Frustrating to say the least," Timbers coach and general manager Gavin Wilkinson said.
"Sometimes you have to make decisions based on a strength in one area to improve the team," Armstrong said. "That's what I believe we did over the last 18 months. I thought a strength of our team was on defense, and it gave us an opportunity to go to the draft and move a player like Rundblad, knowing at that time that we had two very good righthand defensemen in (Alex) Pietrangelo and (Erik) Johnson. There were too many similar pieces."
Over and over, the testimony of those in favor of same-sex marriage carried the same theme: others’ ignorance of the law, inability to accommodate same-sex couples as codified under the law, and overall failure to comply with the law and definitions under New Jersey’s civil union law.

One of the pitfalls of special elections is that they do not feature a primary contest. That means in districts like Zimmerman's old one, which leans heavily Democratic, the party committee that picks the nominee is often, in effect, picking the winner of the election.
Today, the NCAA gets the bulk of its revenue from a $6billion, 11-year contract to air the men's Division I basketball tournament on CBS. That deal depends on the public believing college basketball is legitimate.

Olympic Provision's still-evolving menu is eclectic, with options such as pork rillettes hand pies ($4); steamed mussels with hot sopressata and braised kale; grilled octopus with pickled chile relish; and beer-poached garlic sausage with mustard, apple and cabbage ($12). Nothing will top $15, and bottles selected from the wall of wine will carry a corkage charge of $5 to $10 over take-away prices.
First, defensive end Justin Tuck applied the pressure, bullying Wayne Hunter into Mark Sanchez, and forcing the quarterback to hold the ball longer than he wanted. He tried to scramble, but defensive tackle Chris Canty got to him in the end zone and the referees ruled forward progress had stopped there. A sack and safety. Just like that, the game was all but over.

But the timing of the case — and the airing of a "Saturday Night Live" skit parodying the woman — is helping the American Cancer Society get its message out, said Blair Horner, vice-president for Advocacy for the American Cancer Society of New York and New Jersey. The number of reported cases of melanoma in New Jersey soared by 43 percent over the past decade, Horner said, citing state health department data. Citing the Archives of Dermotology journal, he said indoor tanning has become increasingly popular among young adults during that same period.
Meg Linton, director of the gallery, organized the show with curatorial intern Nina Laurinolli. They came up with a roster of 28 artists from L.A. and beyond, some with deep local exposure and others with very little, who "draw, cut, film, pin, perforate, perform and journal." Material engagement is largely what unifies the group, which settles thoughtfully into clusters around notions of exuberant energy (Ann Diener, Penelope Gottlieb, Aaron Noble, Erin Marie Dunn, Emily de Araújo, Mindy Shapero), performative gesture (Barbara Berk, Takehito Koganezawa), diaristic notation (Fred Stonehouse, Tucker Neel) and the vulnerabilities of the social/political/religious status quo (Sandow Birk, Joe Biel, Eric Beltz, Richard Keely and Anna O'Cain).

Salinger is not the classic movie spy but more the rumpled field agent, almost consumed by his cause. That hardly seems the role for an actor with leading-man looks.
Shame on Rev. Jamal Bryant and the mayoral candidates for trashing Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake because she was absent from the mayoral debate on August 2 ( "Candidates focus on schools, crime," Aug 3). As a city resident, I want my mayor to be out with communities during annual grassroots events like National Night Out, not campaigning. The mayor was right to attend these events, spending time with neighborhoods who fight to reduce crime. It's surprising that the candidates did not take advantage of these numerous events throughout the city to campaign. Perhaps they and whoever chose the date for the debate are the ones out of touch and do not understand what's important to city residents.

Performed with almost no cuts, the opera’s hyperactive charm began to wane by the end. But Hak Soo Kim provided a final kick with "Cessa di piú resistere," his often-cut aria warding off Bartolo’s useless advances.

Why not advocate conscious accuracy with determined analysis? Should we not as responsible citizens exercise prudence and then demand proof rather than accept opinions at face value? If we analyze information that is believed to be accurate, can we not be much more objective? Isn't there a fearful risk of unconscious self-deception because we wish to be heard along with the others in the pack?

øLisa Von Drasek, director of the Center for Children's Literature at Bank Street College of Education in New York, says: "Sendak smashed the perception of childhood as a time of pleasantness, a time of unicorns and rainbows, sweetness and light.

"It's pretty easy to go to the not-to-be-missed Bishop Museum even if you are not staying on Oahu. I book my return flight from Kauai, Maui or the Big Island with a long layover in Honolulu.

A better criticism of the board is that if healthcare costs go up rapidly, it will have to recommend changes that generate savings right away. That tight time frame favors short-term fixes, such as cutting doctors' fees, that could hinder access to care. Rather than addressing those problems and drawing bipartisan support, however, the House GOP proposed to replace the board with a controversial set of limits on medical malpractice claims, assuring the bill's demise in the Senate. Lawmakers' track record on Medicare shows that they don't have the political will to hold down spending. Despite the new board's potential faults, it's a better approach than having no restraints at all.

Mergers and acquisitions have been a growth engine for tech jobs around these parts as well. The last 14 months have seen several $100-plus million acquisitions of local tech players. Palo Alto-based cloud and security mega-player VMware acquired New Brighton-based Shavlik Technologies; SAP subsidiary SuccessFactors purchased Jobs2web; Amcom Software is also under new ownership; and Dell Computer bought Compellent for close to $1 billion -- all in 2011.

St. Petersburg's parliament was the latest to enact such a law, which imposes fines of up to $17,000 for spreading "propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality or transgenderism among minors," and the national parliament in recent weeks has taken up similar legislation.

Obviously there’s some kind of doubt in Andy’s mind. Doubt that he left the game too early.”

(released earlier this year on Dromedary Records) comes across as an amalgam of college-rock’s brightest moments, incorporting elements like the throaty angst of the Replacements, the roiling guitars of Husker Du, and the jangling melodies of R.E.M. “The 65’s sounds way cooler than The 85’s, though,” Vocaturo notes, laughingly.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor framed it as a question of judicial conservatism: How far should the justices go to decide statutory matters that Congress could decide for itself?

View full sizeChris FallowsA: Since the age of 2, I have in some or other way been involved with wildlife. I grew up going to game reserves in Africa and developed a love of wildlife from this. When we moved to the coast in 1985, my love of the sea grew stronger and I started a tag-and-release program with the local fishermen to release sharks from their nets. One day we caught a young great white, and this sparked a fascination for them. In 1991, a research group offered me a volunteer position working with great whites. In 1996, I started my own company, Apex Shark Expeditions, which runs to this day taking guests to see these beautiful creatures. In 1996, I discovered the unique breaching behavior seen at Seal Island and later on documented the incredible natural predation seen at this island. This natural predation is seen nowhere else on Earth with the same intensity, and each day is compelling to watch these sharks and seals battle for survival.

The second problem with that: You can’t realistically expect mud to stick here. We’re talking about a 61-year-old grandfather who in his spare time speaks about his faith at his church in Manasquan.

"President Assad has communicated directly to the opposition, and to me personally, that he is prepared to do that, not as a ruse to stay in power but as a step to the natural path to Syria's progress and development. We must be mindful however of the actions of extremists who are using this time of transition as an opportunity of cover for their own anti-democratic agenda."

Maryland has two major programs designed to help prevent people from being forced out of their homes because of rising property taxes, and through extensive analysis of state records, The Sun's Jamie Smith Hopkins and Scott Calvert have documented problems with both of them. The pair reported last year that the Homestead Property Tax Credit, which limits the annual increases in homeowners' property tax bills, was fueling massive inequities in how much people were paying and was in some cases providing tens of thousands of dollars in subsidies for wealthy people who didn't need the help. On Sunday, they tackled the Homeowners' Property Tax Credit, which is supposed to provide relief on a sliding scale for homeowners with incomes below $60,000 and limited other assets. The problem with that program is twofold: Many longtime homeowners who are struggling don't know about it, while at the same time, others are using the credit to help them buy homes they might not otherwise be able to afford.

Increasingly, the answer seems to be no. Florida looks remarkably vibrant these days. Indeed, the state's reversal in domestic migration has been spectacular: it gained a net 55,000 domestic migrants in 2010 and 119,000 in 2011. Only Texas, the leader in net domestic migration since 2006 (when it took over from Florida), added more domestic migrants last year. Between 2009 and 2011, Florida's total population gain—which includes domestic migration, international migration, and births minus deaths—was more than 500,000 people, putting the state on track to become the nation's third-largest by 2013.

Nor do I. Did Smith do the right thing in not paying Jackson all that money and allowing him to leave? If it would have meant closing up free agent shop, yes.

Classical groups playing pop or rock can sound too straitlaced for the music to seem natural. Too much bombast and showoffy virtuosic moves can be just as much of a turnoff — especially when an artist applies the same treatment to “classical” pieces like what one calls Beethoven’s “The 5th.”

Steele made a one-yard run but Baker was stopped by the defensive front for a three-yard loss. Hall and Steele were both stopped before gaining yardage as the drive stalled.

Waitz was a fantastically gifted runner. She had an elegant, efficient stride and never looked tired, at a moment when women athletes simply could not afford to. The times she posted in the marathon do not have the faded and remote look of historic stepping stones. Her winning time in the 1980 NYC marathon would be fast enough to have won last year, or in 2009, or in 2002.
Until recently, anesthetic gases were thought to produce no long-term effects on the central nervous system. New studies have changed this view quite substantially.

BARNEGAT — When Harold J. Smith was diagnosed with kidney cancer, bitterness was a plausible option. His doctors told him the illness was the result of the toxic dust he had ingested during the months of clean-up after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at the World Trade Center.
Air travelers have used other tricks to elude the scan/pat-down dilemma. They include traveling with the kids -- TSA agents seem far less likely to split up a family or to pat down young children -- and bringing along pets.

My focus is on rebuilding our city and doing it in a way that benefits each and every neighborhood. But it has to be done right. We can't allow unrestricted growth and development to further clog our streets, take away our parks, canyons or open space, or pollute our beaches and bays.

Presley joined guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black for his first recording session at Sun Studios in Memphis on July 6, 1954. Things didn't go well until the trio began fooling around with an up-tempo version of a song called "That's All Right." In that moment, Presley and his band (with a big assist from Sun Records founder Sam Phillips) merged country and white blues and black rhythm and blues to forge a new musical sound. It arguably was the birth cry of rock 'n' roll.

Frazer would have had little trouble recognizing this phenomenon; since before the dawn of history, communities have heaped the blame for every ill that befell them over the previous year on a single figure -- the scapegoat -- then burned him in effigy, banished him or even sacrificed him. Like scapegoats of old, President Bush is hardly responsible for all the woes piled at his doorstep. Yet his shortsighted policies on energy and the environment, his illegal or irrational overreaching in the war on terror and his failure to regulate a financial system floating on a bubble of too-easy credit contributed heavily to many of our most serious problems.

Match textures: Consider the texture of the lettuce with what you're serving. Because meats are heavy, heartier lettuces such as romaine are the best matches. Then again, if you slice the meat thinly, lighter greens work fine as long as you cut up the other ingredients in similar ways. For example, thinly slice the nectarines to go with light frisee lettuce.
What is essentially a shameless infomercial for Steve Harvey's dating advice book becomes tolerable and even enjoyable at times thanks to this romantic comedy's attractive, likable cast. Harvey's best-selling "Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man" serves as the launching pad for four intertwined stories in which various types couple up and try to make a go of it. Think Dominic, the Dreamer (Michael Ealy), and Lauren, the Woman Who Is Her Own Man (Taraji P. Henson). Director Tim Story keeps things moving at a mostly lively clip, but the script is crammed with plot and loaded with contrivances. Rated PG-13; sexual content, crude humor, drug use. 2 hours, 2 minutes. By Christy Lemire.

fruit leather so that it is just big enough to wrap around a thin pretzel stick. Cut slits in the bottom side of the leather, wrap it around the pretzel and spread out the cut part to look like broom bristles. The fruit leather will stick to itself and the pretzel.

Syrian President Bashar Assad's violent response to protests in his country — his government has killed hundreds of unarmed demonstrators in recent weeks and detained thousand of pro-democracy activists — is likely to test the limits of that policy. Much as the Obama administration may abhor the Assad regime's murderous rampage, there appears to be very little it can do to stop it.

Reflecting on last season, when he was unable to practice or move efficiently, he told Yahoo.com, "I felt like I was playing on one leg. I wondered how I was ever going to play basketball again.

As you say, the Limbaugh HATE can be instructive. We can all teach our kids about HATE if we listen to Limbaugh. But is Rush Limbaugh's hate mongering really a necessary tool to train our children? I think not. Is it harmful to society? I think overwhelmingly yes, it is. It lends a sense of tolerance and to some degree, endorsement, by our society of fear, hatred and divisiveness that tears at the very seams that hold society together. Hate mongers are free to speak on any street corner, but should we as a society encourage such speed by assisting it to flourish in a commercial environment? ...
``Since the onsent of the smoking ban in 2008, the Casino Queen has lost approximately 35 percent of our adjusted gross revenue,'' Rand told the committee.

He probably didn't realize how right he was. Locksley's return to Maryland might not include comebacks to freestyle rap disses -- at least not yet -- but it will be steered by everything he learned, and some things he would probably just as soon forget, since he left College Park 10 years ago.
Laguna Beach's Mark Dressler collected the highest total pay among local teachers in 2009-10, at $170,527. The drama teacher and adviser – who has 28 years with the district and a master's degree and works at a middle school and a high school – had a base salary of $118,183.
There's nothing easy about her images, which are the unforgettable stars of "Käthe Kollwitz: Making Human," a small but rewarding show at the Weisman Art Museum. Of the 34 images and objects, 14 are etchings, lithographs, woodcuts or drawings by the artist. Powerful and often harrowing, they span her 40-year career and make the show a must-see opportunity. Organized by Corrina Kirsch, a Weisman curatorial fellow, the show is enhanced with images -- primarily etchings and lithographs -- by Kollwitz's contemporaries George Grosz and Otto Dix, and by artists who influenced her, such as Francisco Goya and Honoré Daumier. Finally, it is deftly fleshed out with work that has thematic affinities, including photos by Lewis Hine, Jacob Riis and Larry Clark, a book of silhouettes by Kara Walker and a pair of etchings by David Hockney.

In the center of a gray slab of slate sits a small rectangle of thin pastry, topped by a layer of fruit compote and a coating of deep-black blood sausage, with a dollop of foie gras. I cut off a corner and spread on a tiny dot of yuzu sauce, a paste made of a Japanese citrus fruit mixed with pepper and salt, which brings the disparate elements of the dish together in an original, fresh, spicy way.
Initially, he focused on Obama, blaming him for not supporting construction of a Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline. Later, he turned his sights on Mourdock, attacking him as "untrustworthy" in a series of negative ads. Lugar's campaign spent at least $2.5 million on advertising to answer Mourdock's charges and cut him down. Republicans say that effort backfired because the attacks undercut Lugar's reputation as a statesman.
Among the New Jersey victims, some used the tracks as a shortcut. Others chanced a crossing when the gates were down. Many committed suicide, a far larger issue than the railroad industry has historically recognized and one it has only recently begun to address.

We would like to assure you that an overly-warm auditorium cited by music critic Sarah Bryan Miller in Monday's review of the performance by guitarist Douglas Niedt at the Ethical Society on March 27 is of concern to us as well. Last Saturday we experienced some unanticipated problems in implementing our cooling plan, problems which are correctable and will be attended to. Our organizations have cooperated closely for over thirty-five years to jointly present fine musical performances. Please know that the comfort of all who attend events in the Ethical Society auditorium is of paramount importance to all of us.
All indications are Ethier is poised for a strong season, and if the jury is absolutely still out on Uribe, at least he’s managed enough seeing-eye singles to post a .267 batting average and turn the glare elsewhere.

CP: The hipster bikers, in their tattoo-baring hemp capris and porkpie hats, can be just as annoying as the Tour de 50th and France ones.

Small, pricey hotels also can promise exclusivity. After all, a couple that typically stays in $200-a-night hotels may splash out for a $500 room on their anniversary. But rates approaching $1,000? Probably not.
Despite a soft hotel market, a bevy of downtown developers are racing to secure hospitality deals. They're focused on a huge wave of planned development, including a casino, a new convention center and a medical mart, a showplace for medical devices and merchandise.

But it's the mine owners who run commercial operations (as well as "dig your own") with the proper heavy earth-moving equipment needed to reveal new material who unearth such clusters. Those of us who go for a dig do so for the fun of it and to keep what we find - which perfect (or otherwise), transparent (or murky) is treasure though probably not worth thousands of dollars.
One reason for management to buy time is that acquisitions and mergers are stressful and labor-intensive. Hiring freezes are common in any sort of takeover and employees often assume extra duties. It may behoove the company to keep you around until the dust settles and then show you the door. The company acquiring yours also needs time to identify redundancies in staffing, which inevitably lead to layoffs, and figure out which positions to eliminate in order to reduce costs.
