Telluride joins a handful of Colorado ski areas - like Eldora, Wolf Creek, Echo Mountain, Durango Mountain Resort and Aspen Skiing Co.'s quiver of four hills - that saw visitation remain similar to the record season of 2010-11. Wyoming and New Mexico — home to the thriving Taos Ski Valley — were the only states to show annual increases in visitation.

I hate to decry a protest. It makes me feel old. Old people dismissed the civil rights movement and the protests against Vietnam as kids with nothing better to do making trouble in the street. I'm all for a good protest, and if the outraged were showing up en masse in May to demand national health care, or to fix immigration, I'd write a column urging everybody to take a day off and join them. But NATO? They're upset about NATO? Are you? Is anybody you know? I didn't think so.

Voegeli acknowledges that the requirement that people have coverage is consistent with John Stuart Mill’s dictum that limiting the freedom of some (in this case the uninsured) is only appropriate when it avoids their harming others (in this case through making others pay for the cost of covering their care). This requirement that others pay is called the "cost shift," and it is borne, in particular, by California businesses that pay thousands more than their international competitors on health coverage for their employees. Voegeli concludes, though, that "under the guise of preventing cost shifting … Obamacare commits cost shifting" by requiring people to pay for more of the care or protection of others than is absolutely necessary.
To all this Beinart's considered reply seems to be: Whatever. Israel, he says, is a "regional superpower" that can dispatch its enemies almost with the flick of a finger. I can't swear that Beinart never devotes more than a sentence to Iran's nuclear capabilities (the review copy I used for this essay lacks an index). But I am pretty sure he doesn't give the subject more than a paragraph, and certainly not a whole page. It's true he makes a fuller case when writing about delegitimization and anti-Semitism. But here, too, he's dismissive of the idea that there's any real problem: "The main reason Israel generates disproportionate criticism from leftist academics, artists and labor unionists, not to mention the General Assembly of the United Nations, is not because it's a Jewish state but because it's perceived as a Western one," he explains. So, now you know that the General Assembly's 1975 "Zionism is Racism" resolution really wasn't aimed at the Jews at all.

Gredos is an area seemingly untouched since the Celts, and Romans marched through ages ago. Surrounded by bucolic pastures and scenic mountain ranges, 20 Spaniards and 20 Anglo volunteers spent a week together in a renovated villa speaking English while learning about one another - the good, the bad, and the unmentionable. The Anglos were a mix of people from Ireland, Canada, Australia, Britain, and Belgium, diverse in their backgrounds and ranging in age from mid-20s to late 50s. The Spanish students were mostly professionals sent by their employers because of a need for conversational English in their work.

Drayton tries to educate recruits on the spread running backs succeeding in the NFL -- that running in space, with fewer defenders near the line of scrimmage, is a good thing. Part of the view of the Meyer offense stems from that fact that, at its heyday at Florida, the Gators' two best running threats weren't running backs -- they were quarterback Tim Tebow and receiver Percy Harvin. Tebow and Harvin were the Gators' top two rushers in 2007 and 2008.

This was encouraging and so was the bar scene. Two Tahoe-based members of the U.S. Ski Team were there, and they wouldn't be in a tourist joint.

When Cobb and Ariadne make the tremulous and altogether familiar-sounding decision ("No!" "But I've got to!" "But it's too dangerous!" "But it's our only hope!" "OK, but I'm coming with you!") to move down into a fourth dream world, I hoped we might finally be headed for a riot of architectural invention. Instead, we get an odd, desultory cross between downtown Los Angeles circa 1965 and the urban-planning fantasies of the French Modernist architect Le Corbusier. Downtown's 1965 Department of Water and Power building, designed by AC Martin and Partners, has been stretched in Seussian fashion to become a very tall skyscraper; on the horizon, meanwhile, appear dozens if not hundreds of Corbusian, tenement-like towers.

Let's get back to Genesis 6-16. In the Hebrew text, God literally tells Noah to illuminate the ark. To make a window is a reasonable interpretation. The Hebrew word for ark is "teva." In ancient Jewish writings, the word teva also means the written word. Thus, the Jewish mystical tradition understands that Genesis 6:16 is an instruction to shine light on the written word. And this commandment is followed by essentially every religion in the world at this time of year.
They stay connected by putting God first, then putting each other second.
A certain slice of the 20-something demo is ready to reframe the discussion. For this rarefied collection of youthful, privileged, post-grad New York women, the bar is set high. They've come so far, they feel free to dump on themselves. They're not interested in expensive shoes so much as artfully expressing the pain of their lives.

"I still have the scars to remind me of the accident," said Kanaan, who slid his No. 55 Hollywood/Mo Nunn Racing Mercedes-Reynard into the Turn 7 wall. "I tried to find the limit in qualifying and went over it and hit pretty hard. It was my fault, my mistake -- not the track's fault."

The film portrays “dis-integration” as if it came about solely because of the rejection of France by some of its youth. Reality is more complicated.
Reality: The belief that immunizations like the flu vaccine are a cause of autism has been around since 1998, when British physician Andrew Wakefield published a paper in the Lancet journal alleging a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autismlike illness in 12 children. The paper has since been revoked and his research been deemed fraudulent by Britain's major medical institutions.

The induction ceremony will take place July 22. It figures to be quite a celebration for the Santo family. They deserve it. But so did Ron Santo.
But here's the rub: sulfites aren't really the issue. Used since Roman times to combat oxygen's deleterious effects on wine and its vibrancy, sulfur serves a purpose that Europeans accept, so they allow their organic wines to contain sulfur. Not so here. And without sulfur, even the tiny amounts (say, 30 to 50 parts per million), wine will struggle to retain its freshness.

The docudrama sequel, which opened Saturday at New Conservatory Theatre Center, isn't as potent as Tectonic's "The Laramie Project," which has been seen by tens of millions of people in countless professional and school productions since it opened in 2000. But it's more than an important footnote.

There's one in almost every family; a piece of furniture with history.
In his 2010 State of the Union address, Obama flagrantly misrepresented the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which did not "open the floodgates" for foreign corporations "to spend without limit in our elections" (the law prohibiting foreign money was untouched by Citizens United) and did not reverse "a century of law." Although Obama is not nearly as well-educated as many thought, and he thinks, he surely knows he was absurd when he said last Monday, regarding Obamacare, that it would be "unprecedented" for the Supreme Court to overturn a "passed law."
“What separates Muhammad from most freshmen is his approach and desire to be the best in everything he does,” Scout.com analyst Brian Snow said. “From the time he was a freshman, he has had one clear focus, and that is to be the best -- and his game has grown because of it.

The next step is to install the actual turf, which is expected to begin sometime next week.

He never let exhaustion stop him before, and that impulse to do everything and never say no has gotten Sarnoff into trouble. An ill-advised decision to appear at an evening fundraiser for the Oregon Symphony in August 2007 led the sleep-deprived morning DJ to pop an Ambien during his drive home. Another driver saw Sarnoff's car moving erratically (which Sarnoff swears had more to do with spilled potato chips than the drug, which he had only just taken) and called the police.

"In the business world, you can go out and do the paperwork and no one would ever hear about it," Seau said in 1995. "But when you go out here on the field, it's a do-or-die situation.

There's six points on the board and you're hurting a lot of folks. Instantly."

The show was actually the second of the season and a bit of the rust was evident, especially in Keith's almost two-hour set. Starts and stops were off, sound cues were missed, Keith reversed the choruses in "I Love This Bar'' and called himself on it later during the song, and the video for "Bar'' began to repeat as as he and the Easy Money Band slid into the following song, "Shoulda Been a Cowboy.''
To say that I have reveled in my all-Mac status would be an understatement. I've taken pride in belonging to an "elite" club. We weren't part of that gigantic herd of sheep trapped in their cheapo, unreliable Bill Gates worlds. And we have style, man. I've always enjoyed the gasps of amazement when I pulled my paper-thin, stainless steel laptop out of my briefcase at the Statehouse or a political event.

Still, the show has much to offer. One can see the move to naturalism that came after the elongated figures and compartmentalized space of Mannerism, the period just before the Baroque. Here, a small portrait of a nobleman by Jacopo da Empoli demonstrates the movement toward life drawing in the period in Florence. Tiny but meticulously detailed, it draws the viewer in to marvel at the delicate lace collar on the nobleman's suit.

Because of a ballot initiative, Sanders took office with more power than any previous mayor. But he has often found himself at odds with two other newly empowered political entities: the City Council, whose power was also increased by the ballot measure, and the city attorney's office, where former litigator Michael Aguirre has asserted the right to power nearly equaling the mayor's and the council's.

 When folks have finished eating  often signaled by empty plates, utensils placed on the plates or, in our case, a half-eaten "double-cut" pork chop sitting untouched for 20 minutes  it is customary to remove those plates. When there is a large portion of meat left on a plate, inquire about a doggie bag. Our waiter walked by, looked at the plates, looked at us, then walked away without comment. The bistro's host cleared the plates at our urging.

Quade has a very good shot at being the manager, and after all the players endorsed him, it'd probably be an upset if anyone else got the job. The Cubs don't need a marquee name to draw fans.

Hales: I don't want to reject the premise of that because I want to be in favor of everything for everyone. But the trick to leadership is reaching out to partners and convincing them to do more. So, certainly, this is the case for the arts. The city provides a modest amount of funding for the arts through RACC. But what's more important is our ability to form those partnerships with organizations, funders, school districts, with national resource organizations. We recently had an opening in our campaign office and that's an example of that. My wife reached out to Latino Art NOW through our friend Chris Beanes and he organized the show. The artists dedicated time in hanging the show. That cost no dollars, just time and thought. So I wouldn't ever want to be in a position to not do things because the human resources to make them happen wasn't there. Instead, I'd look for the volunteer support to make them possible.

The small-plate menu includes a brochette d'onglet, or a marinated hanger steak grilled and served on a Caesar salad, for $5, or for $7, add a brie en croute, French brie wrapped in a puff pastry and baked. It includes seasonal fruit chutney. You'll feel fancy just ordering the small-plate appetizers, each one having a more delicious description than the last. The $5 dishes are available only at the bar, but the small-plate dishes range from $7 to $12 and are served in the restaurant, too.
For us, Nelson was a three-day respite at the northernmost point of a 1,200-mile road trip that began in Seattle and ended in Portland, Ore. We window-shopped on Baker Street; bought many "Magic Treehouse" volumes in Otter Books for our 7-year-old daughter, Grace; paced the little pier that juts into the lake; took a skiff for a buzz around on the water; and drove across the big orange bridge — which locals call "BOB" because, remember, it's a Big Orange Bridge — toward the postcard views at Pulpit Rock overlook and Kokanee Creek Provincial Park.

He said that the state needs to balance the budget and live frugally, "but we also need to do what God has asked us to do here and now, which in your noble vocation and calling means saving lives. Little lives. Lives that can't even speak or walk for themselves depend on you."

2. Andrew Bynum. He's finally answered the bell on whether he can stay healthy. His post presence, footwork and aggressiveness improved so much that it only took a few games before Bryant proclaimed Bynum as the No. 2 guy in the team's pecking order. Considering the Lakers have a distinct size advantage, there's no reason to think that will change. Unless the Lakers don't pass enough inside, of course.

Sometimes George has flashes of excellence, like the dominant triple-double he put up in the regular season at Dallas. The problem, though, is you start to expect that kind of performance more often. The raw ability is there. But he must take open shots and take the ball to the basket.
Luke absurdly rationalizes that he somehow was saved from the brink when his eyes met Mei's, and he repays her the only way he knows how: by killing anyone who so much as looks askance at her. Statham's moments with Chan are mostly awkward, though. Being paternal clearly isn't in the actor's bag of tricks.

Remember that story about the guy busted for barking at a police dog? He's fighting the charges by saying it's a free speech issue.

It would seem that this also makes us take a stand against any form of taxation, because taxation is a form of initiating force. If one believes in taxation or initiating force, it would seem that he must discard the commandments against stealing and coveting, the Golden Rule and the Declaration of Independence, which says "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." Since no man can give another man's consent, then, if we believe in this principle, governments should be supported on a voluntary basis. If a man does not consent to voluntarily paying, he should not be compelled to pay. The reason is that the minute you compel him, you are violating moral principles and cannot tell the difference between that form of government and the compulsion of communism other than degree.

The novel features a killer of an opening sentence: "The strangest thing about my wife's return from the dead was how other people reacted." Uh-oh, you think.

Have your grandson empty his bladder before going to bed. If you wake him about an hour earlier than you now do (two to three hours later), that could keep him dry through the rest of the night. Bladder training increases the size of his bladder. Ask him to delay in responding to the urge to urinate during the day. Allowing more urine to fill the bladder stretches it and increases the volume of urine it holds.
Making posters, too. Part of the show is an in-gallery printing press "to make sure that people understand that these posters that are framed on the wall were not meant to be posters on the wall," de Guzman says.

As part of six defensive changes, Donovan was playing centerfield in the eighth. (In case you want 'em all for posterity, the four guys to move aside from Donovan/Schneider were Grinnan from left to third, John Kane from second to shortstop, Mike Sciasi from third to second and Rogers from center to left.)

In the Bronx, the Yankees have added arms new (Michael Pineda) and old (Andy Pettitte) as they prepare for another six-month journey that should lead them into October once again. In Flushing, the Mets hope their wounded — Johan Santana, David Wright and Ike Davis — can return and lead them to respectability. And all around baseball, they think about last Sept. 28, when the country was mesmerized by all that was happening, all on the final day of the regular season, the dreams dashed and realized. Then wonder, how will it all unfold in 2012?
A letter signed by 32 senators raises a host of practical objections rooted in the concept and operation of the family farm, including this one: "Until recently, farms jointly owned and operated by multiple family members had discretion over the responsibilities they gave their children on the farm. But the proposed rule change would do away with that freedom. . . . It is common in rural America for siblings to jointly own and operate farms and for extended family and neighbors to participate in agriculture production. With this rule change, the government is proposing to tell farmers and ranchers: We know what's best for your children, and what they should and should not be doing."

Sure, there are places where people look at you funny or you know you're out of place — The Castle, for example. But they leave you be and treat you like any other customer.

Even then, other guests pointed at and whispered about them. So unless you're able to show you're worthy to drink in this bar, don't expect to be treated like royalty. People drink here for status and the ability to say they go to Taps.
