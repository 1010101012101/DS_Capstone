For now, better times seem distant. Even with no hurricane or other natural disaster to blame, Detroit has – by many measures – replaced New Orleans as America's most beleaguered city.
Maybe the Lions would have stood pat even with Johnsons deal already done. But even with the cap space that was created when Matthew Stafford, Nate Burleson and Ndamukong Suh restructured their deals, there was little room for Martin Mayhew to make any major moves. Now that the Johnson deal is done, Mayhew knows exactly where he stands. Its just a shame that he couldnt have known that on the eve of free agency as opposed to the evening after free agency started.

No matter how practical they may be, it's hard to get excited about those plain, reusable 3 oz. plastic bottles that fit the TSA carry-on requirements and serve as a constant reminder of the new era of flying. Showoffs' see-through quart-size reusable bag with three empty bottles may seem too boring for even a stocking stuffer, but with a little creativity it makes a handy gift for the frequent traveler. Label the bottles and fill them with your own vacation favorites - an invigorating citrus shower gel, the broad spectrum sunscreen you swear by. Or bring them to your local health food store where you're likely to find a great array of lotions and potions in bulk. Don't worry about spillage: The bottle closures are leak resistant.

"I was trying to find out what the minimum definition of a sculpture was — what could be a sculpture and only a sculpture. It has to be three-dimensional," the artist said, reached by phone in New York. "And I wanted it to be a useless thing. A lot of pebbles you could put in your driveway; an individual pebble has no exchange value." To complete these bare-bone sculptures, he would engage in some organizing operation, such as numbering the stones or arranging them to demonstrate a mathematical theorem.

Christie projected state revenue would grow by 5 percent during the current budget year, but unemployment is at 9 percent — higher than other states in the region — and tax collections have not lived up to forecasts in the first six months. The gap between tax collections and the projections included in the budget was $325 million, or about 3 percent, through the end of December. If that shortfall holds through the end of the budget year, Christie will have to make spending cuts or raid surplus because the state constitution doesn’t allow a deficit. But if the revenue picture improves by Feb. 21, and his economic advisers see more recovery looming, the increased revenue will help ease many budget problems.

Rush The Court: "Suffice it to say, Jenkins does not shy away from contact and is able to finish in traffic with the best of them. His ability to distribute the ball should not be overlooked either, as he averaged just shy of five dimes a game and boasted a 2.16 assist to turnover ratio. Jenkins is the prototypical “instant offense” kind of player that simply knows how to put the ball in the hole."

Turkey's bid to join the European Union is going nowhere, but Ankara is actively expanding its international influence. NATO membership gives Turkey a voice in Europe and influence in Washington. It is an increasingly important emerging market, with per capita income nearly double that of China and four times that of India. Many in the Arab world look to Turkey as a dynamic, modern Muslim state. Add to this its position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, and Turkey is the very model of a modern major pivot state.

This transition to significantly reshape Minnesota Power’s fleet is well underway and will be facilitated by the Boswell 3 and 4 reinvestments and through previously announced major additions of wind energy and hydro power. -- Source: Minnesota Power/Allete press release, edited

Volcanologists say the twins last erupted 13,000 years ago. Colonists came from the mainland, followed by Greeks and Romans, though the island remained sleepy and remote and thus out of the mainstream. A grape blight in the late 19th century spurred mass emigration, and in 1953, Salina's salt mines closed.

Today, you'll find Nogales a far more hospitable place. Where Pete's ranch once was, is now Pete Kitchens Outpost, a restaurant. It's actually one of the original 1853 structures of the old Kitchen homestead. Life on the border would not be complete without the influence of Pancho Villa, whose army occupied Nogales, Mexico in 1914 during the Mexican Revolution. The U.S. military's garrison in Nogales swelled to over 10,000 mostly black soldiers of the highly decorated 25th Regiment mostly detached from Washington, D.C. The military buildup and related business growth attracted many businesses to Nogales, some of which remain today.

Believers in Oliver Stone's "JFK" and other conspiracy theorists who hoped that Caro, the most hard-working of historians, would finally nail Johnson will have to look elsewhere.

Nothing in his many years of research made him suspect Johnson.

For leaving his alma mater Weber State in the lurch to become head coach at Arkansas. Check it: Smith, an assistant under Bobby Petrino for three seasons, split in December to take the Weber State gig. After Petrino got the boot, Smith couldn't wait to leave people who put so much trust in him. People who gave him a job he always wanted. Smith left Weber before he's even coached a game. "If there's a door open walk through it," Smith said of the "opportunity" to coach Arkansas. What he meant to say was: "If there's a door open, walk out of it."

It lost $7.3 million for the quarter ending Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $8.9 million in the same quarter of 2009.

While she will later explain to Vicki she was “in a fog” at this point of the party, Tamra does see clearly enough to call Alexis out for her “medically necessary – yeah, right” nose job. Honestly, I don’t see why everyone keeps getting on Alexis about this. I mean – I know why I get on her about it, but I live in Baltimore. These chicks live in Orange County – instead of ridiculing her, shouldn’t they be checking to see what gifts Alexis registered for on Rodeo Drive for her “new nose” shower?! Speaking of the nose job heard ‘round the world, in this episode we get the pleasure of watching Alexis check in for rhinoplasty and check out of reality. Can we get this anesthesia to go?

And it gives our residents another world-class retail shopping destination, along with the many other fine stores along Tonnelle Avenue.

Because it is boxing, we know to wear rubber boots to all media gatherings. It is not offensive. It is traditional, almost quaint.

Tax prep companies used the code, known as a debt indicator, as a sort of credit check for a population seen as high risk.
Brady: There's many. Let's talk about micromanufacturing. From that perspective, we have an opportunity in our artisan craft world, to take that world and scale it, whether you are talking about advanced metals and craft involved with that. Or if you're talking about the apparel industry, which I consider a creative impulse. So you're talking about micromanufacturing, promoting micromanufacturing opportunities, creating shared manufacturing centers the city could help collateralize. So that's one. Now, data centers. We need more data centers for the creative economy to grow. The mayor can literally lead the charge to put the right partners in place.

So I think we will see an opportunity to grow the broadband and gigabyte capacity so the creative climate becomes a foundational piece of the creative economy. The mayor can help put that vision together.

You don't have to love the Kinsey Sicks' politically charged humor to become completely hooked by Ken Bielenberg's documentary tracing the beginnings of the group in 1993 through the Sicks' extended gig at the Las Vegas Hilton. The four boys let it all hang out, and it's not always pretty. But it's honest and, more important, it's about trying to keep a long-running show creatively fresh. Audiences get to meet the guys beneath the makeup.

But no one has brought forth such a change. So although I admire the honesty of Tvert's amendment and don't think it would greatly expand current usage of marijuana, I am certain it would create a confusing second system for regulating the drug.

It would be irritating to watch Tim Parks discover that the mind and the body are hopelessly entwined if he were not already so irritated with himself. His vast neuroses are slightly comical, but his pain and discomfort are real. Or are they? On a trip to India, Parks, who grew up in England but lives in Italy with his family, consults an ayurvedic doctor about his prostate condition. For years he has gotten unhelpful advice from Western doctors. The Indian doctor tells him that there is a "tussle" in his soul that will cause him pain if he does not address and dissolve it. He is given breathing exercises and reads the first self-help book he ever purchased, "A Headache in the Pelvis" by Drs. Wise and Anderson. "Every illness is a narrative," he writes in the book's beginning, "What matters is the version you tell yourself." A lifelong academic and skeptic, the author of 21 books (fiction and nonfiction), Parks has a hard time getting his mind out of the way so he can listen to his body. This book represents a departure from the version of the story of his illness that he told himself for so many years. It is the version of the story that includes Parks' own ability to heal himself.

Fact: Passenger rail service and freight rail service are compatible and coexist in many other states. Ohio has worked closely with Norfolk Southern, CSX and Rail America to develop this project and has repeatedly pledged that the introduction of passenger train service will not harm freight service, but make it better. In fact, as much as half of the $400 million investment for the 3C&D service would go to track improvements and track additions on the freight railroad right-of-way and to safety improvements at roadway and railroad crossings. If Ohio manages capital improvements to freight tracks effectively, the railroads will benefit from the increased capacity and higher speeds that will result.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke made clear to Congress last week that the Fed is ready to act, if needed. Bernanke said one option would be cutting to zero the interest rate paid to banks on money parked at the Fed.

The main weakness is the direction of Lewis E. Whitlock III. He doesn't direct as much as simply stage the show, copying moments right out of the movie.

"One of the things I learned the most about last year is how much I love baseball, what a great sport it is and how lucky I am to play it for a living," Wainwright said. "I wouldn't call it restarting my career. Rejuvenating, maybe? I don't know what you'd say because I know I didn't go out poorly in 2010. I won my last game and I got hurt throwing the ball great in (2011) spring training. I guess it's just more of a validation that I can still do it, that I'm a top-flight pitcher who can still get people out."

After several years of losing tens of thousands of construction jobs due to the recession, one thing is clear: We need to stop cutting jobs and start creating them. A major renovation of Wrigley Field and the surrounding infrastructure would do just that. It would create more than 2,000 jobs.
Among the highlights: a multimillion-dollar sound system, to ensure that the volume can be high without distortion and still allow customers to hear one another talk; cocktail glasses made of crystal and titanium, for durability and sparkle; extra-large ice cubes that won't dilute the drinks; and a reservation system for pricey, but prime seating space ($250 for a table of six, $500 for a table of 12, but unlike clubs with bottle service, no alcohol purchases are required).

If you were starting the NCAA from scratch today, it probably wouldn't look much like it does. We could argue NCAA rules for months. But in my mind, it doesn't excuse rule-breaking. I've said all along that almost everyone is wrong on some level in this Ohio State case, from the players to the coaches to the administration to the compliance office. The NCAA is wrong, too, but that doesn't make everyone else OK.

Gary Parrish, CBSSports.com: "When Baylor beat Kansas in the Big 12 tournament last weekend, it looked like the Bears had finally figured everything out and would be a team to be reckoned with in the NCAA tournament. It didn't start out that way against South Dakota State, as the Jackrabbits got out to a 19-7 lead and stayed within striking distance throughout the game. Even though Baylor left for the final 25-plus minutes, South Dakota State cut the lead to four in the final minutes before the Bears separated for a 68-60 victory. The worst sign for Baylor? Perry Jones had two points on 1-of-6 shooting."

Yep. The university invited the onetime action movie star and prominent political activist to speak at its May 9 commencement ceremony for graduating seniors. Glover's academic credentials are respectably average (he's a San Francisco State University alumnus), but he is in many ways a perfect match for the universitya proud leftist (which protects him for the excitable protest-for-protest's-sake contingent of students) who, according to state voter registration records, has a Berkeley address. He could have slept in graduation morning and taken a bus up the hill to the university's Greek Theatre.

A broken utility pole could be whisked away from Clague Road before an anniversary bash marking one full year of its crippled existence. A car crashed into the pole just south of Maple Ridge Road last November, cracking the timber at its base. It's a career-ending injury for a utility pole . . . or at least it should be.
"I think at the beginning of the year, when we took a look at the schedule, before we instituted our 'One Day At A Time' mantra, you look at this stretch and say if you can come out of here winning two out of three on the road that would be something that is pretty good,'' Robinson said.
From Washington state to Arizona to Rhode Island, seniority-based cuts have turned some young teachers against their own unions and fueled efforts — mostly unsuccessful thus far — to revise seniority rules.

The theme of women who are unobjectionable (and even sexy) until they have real power, at which point they are labeled mentally unstable and must be shut down, isn't new. It showed up in another HBO movie by "Game Change" screenplay author Danny Strong, 2008's "Recount."

"I'm no expert on the Browns, but after seeing them let Peyton Hillis go and sign, for such a little amount of money, to Kansas City it's obvious they need help at running back," the scout said.

Yet little about the rise of Hall and Oates was easy. By the time the two began their remarkable run of ’80s pop hits with "Kiss on My List" from the "Voices" album, they had been performing together for 10 years.

The sheer bloody messiness of this play calls forth all of the stagecraft skills that Artists Rep can muster, and its designers and technicians are up to the challenge, creating scenes of carnage that are both gruesome and funny.
