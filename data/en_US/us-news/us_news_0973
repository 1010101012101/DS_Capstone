Not those teeny passes, but big, burly, white-knuckle-inducing roads like Independence Pass between Leadville and Aspen. At 12,095 feet, the top of the pass is well above tree line: This is what it means to be in tundra. This narrow road usually closes in September and opens in late May.

Even in July, cold winds blow across the tundra, but ground-hugging plants and flowers blanket the areas between lichen- covered rocks.

Domino's push to improve the reputation of its pizzas began about two years ago, when the company overhauled the recipe for its basic pie with a new sauce (more red pepper), cheese (shredded, not cubed) and crust (now with garlic flavor). It also launched an in-your-face ad campaign showing customers in focus groups dissing the subpar ingredients of the past. One said the marinara sauce tasted like ketchup.

The drug lord financed public housing and other Medellin public works and made a successful run for Congress. But after he ordered the 1984 killing of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, who had threatened to extradite Escobar to face U.S. drug-trafficking charges, the state declared war. By the time he was hunted down and killed in Medellin in December 1993, the armed forces had controlled his beloved Napoles for two years.
Regardless of jobs created, the city will not realize the increased property taxes for decades. Does up to $33 million cost justify the possible jobs and development? I don't believe so.

Former soldiers described their anguish in attacking civilians and their homes. "It was a horrible thing," said Rodi, a former soldier who said he had been based in Homs. "At the beginning, people in Homs were just going out and asking for their freedom and a change of government. The government started the shooting. After they killed a lot of people, people stood and continued protesting. We started shelling them."

This morning, Whitaker referred to the woman as a prostitute in her cross-examination of Kleem.
Surfers tend to be a low-key lot, downplaying everything from their accomplishments to the size of the waves, all for the good graces of humility. Most every longtime Northern California surfer has known the terror of seeing a shark within point-blank range, and I'm definitely among them; my experience came at Montara, some 15 years ago, a clear-as-day shark skimming through the face of an approaching wave, backlit in the afternoon sun. A friend and I were alone in the lineup, bodysurfing, and we rode a high-adrenaline buzz in a cartoonishly rapid swim for the beach.

Assistant District Attorney Chris Stringer of Benton County said that Yeskie will have 12 months to complete a diversion program; If Yeskie completes the program and stays out of legal trouble the charge will be dropped. "It's important to understand that this is not a conviction," Stringer said. "A diversion program is pretty routine." Yeskie must also pay $458 in fines and assessment.

The Bulls failed to score on 12 of their next 13 possessions, scoring two points in just less than nine minutes of an 18-2 76ers' run. John Lucas III's 3-pointer with 43.1 seconds left stopped the bleeding, pulling the Bulls within 75-74.
There is room for compromise. Perhaps the size of the extension or of the proposed 3.25 percent surtax could be lowered. There is ample room in the federal budget for cuts in spending, too.

Going strong: The genetic research done in Scripps Health's Wellderly Study seeks to understand why some folks remain physically healthy and mentally alert into their 9th and 10th decades while others don't. If Scripps needs more guinea pigs, it might be wise to look inward. Two physicians long associated with Scripps, well up in their 80s, are still practicing medicine: John Carson and David Roseman, both 85. A third, Herman Froeb, 87, is recently retired, but still sees the occasional patient . . .

A few days later my shipment arrived, taped with fancy patterns, of course. But instead of decorating boxes (been there, done that), I used the same concept to brighten up a plain white side table. Pretty packages do come in all shapes and sizes.
David Steele, FanHouse: "The No. 1-vs.-No. 16 matchup almost never lives up to the public's wishes for even the chance of the upset of all upsets. There's pretty much the Princeton-Georgetown game in 1989 and Michigan State-Murray State overtime thriller in 1990, and the rest over the last quarter-century-plus were not all that close after awhile. In the Consol Energy Center on Thursday, with three-quarters of the 18,927 in attendance cheering on the underdogs, Asheville nearly made such support pay off."
As the metal snakes through the machine, the press pushes down on the sheet, cutting out parts and bending them into the proper shape. Think of a baker cutting biscuits out of a large roll of dough. Only imagine that happening with enough force to rip through sheets of steel.
This is sort of a partially deconstructed Cesar salad, heavy on the anchovies and Parmesan cheese. The secret is to use high-quality, olive-oil packed anchovy fillets. The romaine leaves can be separated the day before the party and kept chilled until just before assembling and serving. The anchoiade can be made a day before as well, but bring it to room temperature and mix well before assembling.

Likewise, what is Romney's view on the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which established domestic violence and stalking as federal crimes and provided funding for services for victims? Republicans in Congress are holding up reauthorization of the measure because of protections it would add for undocumented immigrants and gay men and lesbians.
On Friday, Transamerica's remodeled digs smelled like a new car and were empty save for workers planning the move. Craig Gallagher, a senior architect with Aegon, huddled with colleagues — though not in a huddle room — as they prepped for the "controlled chaos" of filling 340 workspaces with office equipment still sitting in Transamerica's leased building on Park Avenue.
The Titanic may have been the largest ship of its day, but San Francisco artist Steven J. Backman has shrunk it to the size of a toothpick.
Logging all of this data on a fleet of heavy equipment may seems obsessive. But consider that a single tire on any of dozens of the company's 400-ton trucks costs $50,000.
For agricultural employers, though, the biggest concern is whether they'll be required to cover seasonal workers, whom Pacific Northwest growers depend on heavily for their labor-intensive fruit and vegetable crops. The law excludes seasonals -- defined as working 120 days or fewer in a calendar year -- from being counted toward the threshold of 50 full-time-equivalent employees that brings employers under the insurance mandate. But a new Congressional Research Service analysis says the law requires employers over that threshold to cover seasonals during the months they are working full-time or pay the penalty.
Craig Kimbrel gave up one run in the ninth before earning his eighth save. Tabata hit a one-out double, advanced to third on McCutchen's groundout and scored on Kimbrel's wild pitch. Kimbrel struck out Garrett Jones to end the game.
This year, zydeco master Tom Rigney has been named 2011 Emperor of the Jubilee. He and his band Flambeau have been festival favorites for the past seven years.

Excerpt: If you’re a team with return issues but a top-flight offense? Then you’re in luck: those five extra yards on the touchback leave you five yards closer to the end zone. Oregon might not need those five yards — not that the Ducks have return issues — but they can’t hurt, of course. For those offensively-gifted teams resigned to a poor-return-game fate, opening a series at the 25 sounds awfully appealing.
But in approving the new indictment, trial judges said they were satisfied the changes, "will not have an impact that could be considered significant upon the accused's right to be tried without undue delay."
Guess that occurred to them too. The New York press conference on Wednesday was called off.

Additionally, Giant Eagle is looking toward 2013 as a time when the company can evaluate its current grocery store location and study the possibilities of a major rehab project.
I did become far more cautious after researching and writing (and rewriting) "Over the Edge." Now every hazard leaps out at me as if in a special effects moment in a movie. I do recognize every place in the canyon where someone has died (like seeing those little crosses along the highway), usually by name of the victim. "Oh yeah," I find myself thinking, "this is where so-and-so died while trying to swim down to camp and drowned." This would seem to suggest that my personal experience might be unpleasant or terrifying as a guide, but in fact it is no different than driving in dangerous traffic where you understand the consequences of screwing up or letting your attention lapse. I love the canyon -- the whitewater and the fantastic hikes -- despite the dangers they pose. And because I know those dangers well and know how to neutralize them easily, I still enjoy immensely the beauty and treasures they offer. My safety talks to clients, however, definitely have lengthened. They used to be long. Now they are longer.
She noted that the $1.92 million was not a figure requested by the industry. "That was not our number, that was what 12 regular folks rendered," she said of the jury, adding that the industry remains open to settling the case with Thomas-Rasset.

SwishScout.com: "The one area of his game where he is consistently solid is on the boards where his tremendous length allows him to snatch any board in the vicinity, and really excels on the offensive boards for getting put backs out of pure effort. While he possesses a solid motor, he doesn’t really do a great job of establishing great post position on either end yet due to a lack of strength, but his rebounding should improve substantially once he does add that muscle and will be able to hold down a spot in the paint."
Knowledgeable Republicans have good arguments on many issues that are worth debating. But in order to elect officials who believe in these tenets, they have accepted the help of people with ideas that have nothing to do with rational discussion.

A: Let me address that issue. This is the first time that I've ever worked for a strong-mayor form of government. Usually what you see when a new mayor comes in, the police chief goes and the fire chief goes and a lot of the department heads. I understand that. If you're not a good fit then the mayor has every right and should replace you with somebody else. So the new mayor will decide. I would stay if I was asked to stay.
Columbia Police Chief Ken Burton offered an even more blunt assessment: "When they're constantly changing the chemical makeup, we'll be constantly chasing our tails."
It sure doesn't seem so. Bennett feigned melancholy while singing the lyric, "Somehow, once upon a time never comes again." But another lyric he sang might be more his mantra: "The best is yet to come." Bennett is always looking ahead. The audience laughed when he dedicated "The Good Life" to Lady Gaga, but it was no joke. "We just made a record together," he added. "Wait'll you hear it."
Instead of rolling out a list of new goals, Christie said he is sticking with the ones that have already turned Trenton upside down: Revamping education, reforming benefits for public employees, getting tough on state finances.

The team is 20-23, it has lost seven of the last nine games, and McMillan has made some glaring and stubborn mistakes in handling this veteran group. But not a single one of the executives I spoke with thought that Portland would fire McMillan after seeing what the Blazers were doing at the deadline. Not one. And in the end, we learn on a day like Thursday that the only vote that counts belongs to the owner.
"Absolute elation,'' she said of her feelings.
Just how much of an impact the outreach campaign is having, however, is unclear.
Gay marriage isn't currently legal in Maryland — legislation allowing it was recently signed by Gov.Martin O'Malley, but it doesn't take effect until next year. In the meantime, the court is being forced to decide whether it can dissolve a marriage that the state doesn't recognize. By hearing the case, Maryland's judiciary assumed a power that threatens the historic concept of divorce.
"I happened to be watching Thursday Night Football for some reason," Washburn said. "I must have been really bored wathching Mississippi State play somebody. And I saw him and I called a friend of mine and I said, `who is this guy, number 94,?' And he said, `Fletcher Cox, he's just a junior.' And I thought, `whoah.' "
"I was ready and the girls were ready," said DeMarse, who allowed only five hits and two walks with four strikeouts in six innings. "I knew it was going to be a different ballgame today. And it was. We came up short. But it was definitely better than the last two games."

The bright yellow car was discovered inside Wade's Richmond storage locker on April 28 after sheriff's sleuths connected him to a shooting two weeks prior of a girl Wade apparently liked and the teen she was dating. Neither was struck during the April 13 attack in Mill Valley even though five shots were fired into their pickup truck. Sheriff's detectives say Wade, dressed in black and riding a motorcycle, had been waiting for the couple to emerge from the male victim's Mill Valley home.

The second holiday compilation from surfer-turned-songwriter Jack Johnson's music label is a typically laid-back affair with a bevy of sun-kissed acoustic ballads (including Johnson's "In the Morning" and Neil Halstead's "Home for the Season") and a number of songs that don't sound much like Christmas tunes at all (Money Mark's "Make Time," Matt Costa's "I Bet on Flying High"). The best part? Local band Rogue Wave turns in a psychedelic pop take on "Jingle Bell Rock."

In defeat, Bodemeister’s performance was the talk of the backstretch yesterday morning, having set blistering fractions and carrying on to deep stretch before I’ll Have Another got to him late. The Baffert-trained colt outran brilliant sprinter Trinniberg to grab pacesetting honors while posting stunning fractions of :22.32, :45.39 and 1:09.80 for six furlongs — fractions that would have proven suicidal for most horses in the grueling 11⁄4-mile route. Just when most spectators expected him to tire, Bodemeister re-broke to sprint clear by three lengths in mid-stretch. The 4-1 favorite’s strides finally did shorten with a sixteenth of a mile to go, and I’ll Have Another had enough of a kick left to overtake him near the wire.

The Associated Press formula calculates an executive's total compensation during the last fiscal year by adding salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest the company pays on deferred compensation and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. The AP formula does not count changes in the present value of pension benefits. That makes the AP total slightly different in most cases from the total reported by companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I ran for President because I believed that this kind of economy was unsustainable – for the middle-class and for our nation's future. I ran because I had a different idea about how America was built – an idea rooted in my own family's story. You see, Michelle and I are where we are today because even though our families didn't have much, they worked tirelessly – without complaint – so that we might have a better life. My grandfather marched off to Europe in World War II and my grandmother worked in factories on the home front. I had a single mom who put herself through school, and would wake before dawn to make sure I got a decent education. Michelle can still remember her father heading out to his job as a city worker long after Multiple Sclerosis had made it impossible for him to walk without crutches.

Six months out, it's a tie.
Why have the results of China's record-breaking production of new opera houses and concert halls been so visually striking and so functionally uneven? The multipurpose "Grand Theaters" built as the centerpieces of China's instant new cities and new business districts have been conceived less as finely tuned music venues, along Western lines, than as nationalistic symbols featuring propagandistic displays and popular Italian operas and Broadway musicals. Are they now moving toward more sophisticated artistic and musical performance and management? Ms. Newhouse thinks so, citing Ms. Hadid's recent Guangzhou Opera House, two extraordinary, rocklike structures in contrasting white and black marble inspired by stones in a nearby riverbed, where equal attention has been paid to design and acoustics. And there are still more to come from a list of international architectural superstars.

1. Quinn should be a weapon in the Spagnuolo system. Spags is a master at concocting a pass rush. He's among the best in the NFL in coming up with ways to hassle the QB. Spags needs to have a good supply of rushers. It's the life blood to his system. The more pass rushers he has, the more imposing his system will be. And Quinn -- according to every pre-draft report I've read -- is a potentially spectacular edge rusher. I haven't seen one credible draft expert 'diss Quinn's pass-rush skills. They have other concerns -- can he handle the point of attack on runs? -- but no one disputes his ability to get after the QB. Spags can have a lot of fun messing with offensive coordinators as he moves Quinn around, aiming him at the pocket. And you cannot assess this pick without putting it into the context of how Quinn will be utilized by Spagnuolo and defensive coordinator Ken Flajole. It isn't just that Quinn is a pass rusher; he is a pass rusher that is joining a team with a HC who maximizes the ability of a pass rusher.

John Rittmaster, owner of Prima Vini Wine Merchants in Walnut Creek suggests keeping the wine a secret until after the first taste with the food. The secret helps to prevent some preconceived notions about the wine before it is served.

Riedel makes a black sommelier wineglass to hide the color of the wine for blind tasting.

Which brings us around to George. He is the weak link in this otherwise terrific novel. While both he and Amina hide tangled and complex past relationships, it is Amina, her desires, secrets, fears, prejudices, embarrassments, and cruelties that keep us reading. George remains underrealized throughout. Perhaps Amina is so much more compelling because "The Newlyweds" is loosely based upon the story of a young woman Freudenberger met on a plane. The two started a friendship, continued to communicate and the woman's story intrigued Freudenberger enough to travel to Bangladesh and meet her family and, with the woman's permission, to write the novel.

Just recently people went to go vote and they gave a tax hike to repair the federal courts buildings, and now the libraries are asking for a tax hike. This is what happens when you pass tax hikes.

The vibe and crowd: On a recent Friday night it was standing room only; the music and the conversation kept things hopping at a dull roar.

A Different Pointe of View at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort was the big-daddy wine buyer at the time. There were essentially three main wine distributors, and in order to get anything unique or special, we all had to direct, import or clear wines through them.

If you want straight whiskey in the new Louisville, the Silver Dollar is the place. Dozens of whiskeys (and tequilas) line the shelves behind the bar, and they arrive both in an ambitious cocktail list and on their own. Silver Dollar fashions itself a modern honky-tonk, featuring a large American flag across a brick wall (likely more for the motif than patriotism), country music spinning from a turntable and barbecue in the kitchen. It attracts a young and boisterous crowd. Think of it as Meat's fun younger brother. (1761 Frankfort Av.; 1-502-259-9540; www.whiskey bythedrink.com)

Many people, myself included, picked Cena to win this contest, so when he failed to kick out at the end, I personally was shocked. The thought of The Rock winning was always in the back of my mind, but I didn't imagine it would be a perfectly clean 1-2-3 in the middle of the ring.
How off-the-mark is the opinion? It has bonded together the most unusual of political bedfellows: Our gun-toting, libertarian-leaning Republican land commissioner, Jerry Patterson, and one of the most liberal, yellow-dog Democrats ever to serve in the Texas Legislature, former Sen. Babe Schwartz. Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott said the court's premise was built on nothing more solid than, well, shifting sands. It's supported by "nothing," Abbott said. "Not a single case, rule, precedent, principle, empirical study, scientific review or anything else."

In this endearingly saloon-like seafood hangout, the dozen choices of oysters on the half-shell are mostly from the Northwest and Canada, but everything else carries the bracing bite of Louisiana. That means gumbos, po' boy sandwiches, jambalaya and even gator bites, and New Orleans cocktails with a big choice of bourbons. The serious spicing of the cuisine is set off by the ease of the atmosphere and the price structure -- nothing is over $15.

Gavin DeGraw so annoyed his pro partner Karina Smirnoff in rehearsals that she was shown getting duct tape to put over his mouth so she wouldn't have to listen to him.
