"The advantage to LED (bulbs) are the lower amount of power usage and exceptionally longer life," Cheatham said. "But the biggest thing - while you do have a considerable saving in cost in electricity - the biggest thing is going to come in maintenance. It is expensive to have these contractors come out and change these light bulbs."
While St. Louis is helped this year by stable office rents and lower vacancy rates, enthusiasm is tempered by election-year uncertainty, the possibility company acquisitions and European debt "contagion," Jim Mosby, Cassidy Turley's senior managing director, said this month at the annual forecast meeting of the St. Louis chapter of the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors.

IBM surely knew about the club's male-only policy, which apparently wasn't a deterrent. Its marketing executives chose to invest in a Masters sponsorship because the TV audience is a profitable target for the company's products and services, which is likely why AT&T and Exxon Mobile are also on board. Golf on TV attracts an overwhelmingly male audience, few of whom much care about Augusta National's membership policy.

"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.... I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish; where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source; where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials; and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.... I believe in a president whose religious views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon the nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office."

In the last two years, we have come together to address the mess that was our budget. The decline, deficits, and departures that plagued our State just two years ago have been reversed.

Buy the crab, start the bisque
I plan to keep right on mocking those people who insist that standalone cameras are becoming extinct. But that said, the iPhone 4S camera continues to make me very, very happy. Last year, I shot two family Christmas card photos with it. Ideally I would have used a "real" camera for something so important, but the only camera I had at hand when the two Decisive Moments arrived was my iPhone. And though the photos could have been better, they were certainly good enough.
"There really is no such thing as a post-manufacturing society," Daehn said. He added that American innovators for decades did two things well: They developed new products and found creative ways of improving the process of building those products.
Deep in the heart of Cleveland's eastern suburbs, at the end of an antiseptic strip mall, lies a restaurant with the soul of the ancien regime. Iris and Steve Wheeler opened Fountain last July as a gracefully civilized Euro-style respite from our BlackBerry-driven, overworked American lives. It succeeds -- perhaps a little too well. The cumulative lure of the clubby bar, a comfortable dining room, several languid lounge areas and the staff's propensity to hurry absolutely nobody along, can make what was supposed to be just lunch or a quick dinner into a languorous afternoon or evening. As does the food. Well-executed cheese and charcuterie boards are obviously easy to linger over. At Fountain, so are the salads, pastas, crepes, cassoulet and paella; almost everything comes with extra plates for sharing. And it's a good thing, because pricing trends a bit to the high side. Split in half or more, the cost is happily digestible. Though I would have blissfully paid solo for the Asparagus and Artichoke "green plate," smoky roasted vegetables tossed with delicate pea tendrils and a dreamy creme fraiche kicked up with spice. Ditto the Chorizo Crepe, with cayenne-hot sausage, manchego cheese and roasted peppers. And the perfectly paired Nutella and Roasted Pear Crepe would be a gorgeous pleasure at any price. But the restaurant itself may be the biggest bargain. After an evening steeped in the wraparound la dolce vita of Fountain, a trip to the continent may seem redundant. -- Beth Segal, Special to The Plain Dealer

It is important for Richard to know he is devoutly and unconditionally loved. After the hardships he has witnessed and experienced, it is vitally important for him to be assured that he is safe. Richard would benefit from the full attention of his adoptive parent(s), so a family who has already raised their children or a childless candidate would be ideal. On the other hand, he has always been placed in foster care with other children and he has generally done very well, especially with little ones.

Paintings? Sculpture? No. These artists were more likely to do something innovative on the street, the beach or in the Sierra, and document it with still photographs or film.

Cubs tried to buy their way out of a century-long funk when the Tribune Co. opened its checkbook to Hendry following the 2006 season and he nearly got it done. Two first-round sweeps and two empty seasons later, we're back at square one. With new owners and a decreasing payroll, the Cubs have to rely on an improving farm system and a mix of promising young players and aging veterans to compete in an easily winnable NL Central. Quade's style is going to be more direct than Piniella's, and by dint of his personality, more hands-on. He's a coach by trade, of course, and the players are drawn to him."

But what's really amazing is that my parents actually let me wear that uniform every day. I mean, what did the other parents think?

NOTES: The Flyers didn't make any lineup changes. The Devils did. With Kovalchuk returning, New Jersey sat defenseman Peter Harrold, who had played in all nine previous playoff games. The old Devils' record for two fastest playoff goals was 26 seconds by Petr Sykora and Bobby Holik on May 14, 2000, at Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals.

Devils rookie defenseman Adam Larsson, 19, who scored in his playoff debut in Game 2, remained in the lineup. Brodeur will turn 40 on Sunday, in time for Game 4.

Anyway, Shaq is right — holding a slam-dunk contest without LeBron, Kobe, Vince Carter and Dwight Howard is like holding a physicists contest without Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi and Stephen Hawking.
"I recall that game. This is very similar," McMillan said. "It's like he flips the switch. What you want is him taking some of those shots. I thought some of those shots (Sunday) we had covered, but he made tough shots. But you want him taking jump shots and not getting to the free-throw line or getting in the paint."

Nobody needs to be reminded of the declining fortunes of America's Big 3 automakers, but here's a condensed version of that story: Sixty percent of the 447 auto manufacturing facilities that were operating in 1979 have closed.

The heirloom tomato salad, with joltingly juicy tomatoes and creamy mozzarella, made for a super salad. So did the burrata salad, made with that Italian cheese, plus roasted beets and aged balsamic. The octopus marinated in a merken-spiced oil seemed overcooked, though. Farrell found the risotto "soupy," while Snoy thought it needed "a dash of pepper."

Born in Missouri in 1883, Payne lived in Arkansas, Texas and Illinois, where he attended the Chicago Art Institute for two weeks before leaving to study painting on his own. He began his art career by painting signs, stage sets and murals. He first came to California in 1909 and showed his California scenes primarily in Chicago. Eventually he settled in Southern California, married his wife, Elsie, (also a painter) and traveled widely by car looking for "unspeakably sublime" landscapes.

Baltimore also has tremendous needs for school construction and renovation, and diverting slots money from that cause doesn't come without a cost. However, the share of gambling revenues that could have gone to schools would have been miniscule in the context of a $2.8 billion problem. The reason the schools are in such bad shape is that the city's finances are chronically strained. If property tax reduction can help put the city on more sound footing, it would likely be more beneficial to the cause of school renovations in the long run than a few million in annual slots revenue.
The Senate bill, though, would save an estimated $19 billion by 2016, when it's fully phased in. Among its changes: Overnight delivery would not be guaranteed unless sent to and from the same processing facilities. It would be easier for the Postal Service to end door-to-door service in limited instances and deliver instead to curbside or centralized facilities. It also would have two years to implement cost-saving changes, notably a workforce reduction of about 18 percent, or 100,000 jobs. They could be offered buyouts or retirement incentives.

But in a presidential election year, and after 4 1/2 years of recession and grueling recovery, the data have taken on outsized significance.

There are a few things Minnesotans need to know about the companies that are asking the legislature and governor to let them mine sulfide metals from the edges of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Glencore, which wants to mine in a wetland in the Lake Superior watershed near Hoyt Lakes, has brought aboard Tony Hayward as their "Executive expert in charge of environment and safety" Why does the name Tony Hayward ring a bell? He is the former BP executive who was at the helm when the BP oil spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. He famously told reporters after the spill that he, "Wanted to get his life back." Apparently overseeing mining in Minnesota is part of this plan. And another major project, the Twin Metals mine that would be located a few miles from the BWCAW, has recently retained URS Consulting to do their environmental impact study. URS is the company that was in charge of inspecting both the 35W bridge and the Sabo pedestrian bridge when they each collapsed. Maybe bridges isn't their thing, and they will have better luck in the mining business.

The college level? Please. There's far too much money to be had, to say nothing of rampant interest, no matter how dreadfully the BCS has crafted recent postseasons. Maybe it's easy for some suburban California community to denigrate the sport, but don't run that past the folks in Alabama, Florida, Ohio or Texas, where high-school football is a religion, literally the primary focus of countless small towns.

It's a break that's both unfortunate and a bit unfair for the Packers and the Browns, neither of whom did anything scandalous or wrong.

The appointment of committee members was turned over to a new committee mostly consisting of party leadership. The speaker was also given the power to refer legislation to more than one committee.

According to the FDIC, the entire bank board was "grossly inattentive to the affairs of the bank - deferring excessively to the whims of the Giannoulias family.

Andy and Tommy head off on the next leg, as Bill and Cathi and Justin and Sandy quickly realize that the current is too much for them and wrestle with the nursery, coral and undertow. They give up and decide to swap challenges. Siblings Justin and Jennifer luck out with the currents and a handy rock and quickly follow after Zac and Tommy. The current also proves too much for ex-NFL player Marcus, who says it's one of the hardest things he has ever done. So either the Indianapolis Colts are wimps, or it's a really difficult challenge.

Cartels have oceans of money for corrupting enforcement because drugs are so cheap to produce and easy to renew. So it is not unreasonable to consider modifying a policy that gives hundreds of billions of dollars a year to violent organized crime.
Hotel Castlemar, $66-$76. Campeche's history is its main draw, and this place, two blocks from the central square, makes you feel like you're living in it.

It isn't all that rare for RNA viruses to exchange genes in a cell. But to assume that a new, fully functional pathogen can arise de novo in a single pig and instantly become a lethal, highly transmissible, human-adapted virus is like believing that Aphrodite arose perfect from the foam.

Great because Katherine is kind of a nervous character, but Adam is a gentleman and always sort of deferential. So, when she gets in a room with (Rogen’s) Kyle and he just sort of says whatever he wants, not changing his personality for anybody, it was always a little jarring.

"After watching the premier episode, I am disappointed. While taking a funny poke at Portland, the sketches themselves are too long, drawn out, and move too slowly. It is as if they are just trying to fill the time. There is enough material to draw from that they could have shortened these sketches and given us far more different scenarios at which to laugh.
