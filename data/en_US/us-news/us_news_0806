Carter recounted a conversation he had with a businessman who had mentioned that even though his firm was profitable, he wasn't hiring. Carter asked why.

The rock: The hike to Flag Hill (a rock outcrop) is short, 1.26 miles, but involves an 800-foot climb. You get a perch that towers over the Alameda Creek Valley and beyond, along with a view of hovering falcons, eagles and hawks.

As I explained in the story, the corporate kicker was basically a throw-away that legislators gave to Gary Carlson, an Associated Oregon Industries lobbyist at the time. The Senate Revenue Committee had planned to simply have one kicker for individual income taxpayers that would count all unanticipated tax revenues, but Carlson came up with the idea of calculating a separate rebate for corporations.
Ms. White is on an international scavenger hunt for materials. In the fitting room hangs a 19th-century Chinese skirt that she'll dissect for its embroidered silk.

Not sure if that qualifies as praise for Howard or should be seen as damning of the other players who can't win without their one star -- especially after a loss to the Blazers, who trudged through all manner of absences for reasons (injuries) far more acceptable than an inability to control one's temper.

None of that, however, assuages my concern for his well-being — nor, for that matter, my disdain for those who speak blithely of America's need to prolong a costly and questionable approach to foreign policy without understanding the true impact on the warriors and their families, who shoulder the weight of that policy.
Patric Hornqvist, Matt Halischuk, Shea Weber and Mike Fisher each had a goal and an assist, while Andrei Kostitsyn and Francis Bouillon also scored to provide the offense, and Rinne took care of the rest with 24 saves.

A Union offensive near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Va., triggers fierce fighting May 31, 1862, at the Battle of Seven Pines just eight miles east of that city. Confederates defending Richmond under the command of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston attack two Federal units south of Virginia's Chickahominy River. The assaults push Union troops back and mark the start of heavy casualties. Fighting rages as more troops on each side join the fray. Johnston is seriously wounded before the battle ends June 1, 1862. This fight ends inconclusively for both sides with more than 13,700 casualties. But significantly, it marks the rise of Gen. Robert E. Lee to the top of the Confederate command soon after Johnston is wounded. All Richmond had anxiously watched and waited, amid worries whether the city's outer defenses would hold. The Associated Press reports May 27, 1862, that a lead article in the Richmond Enquirer recently issued a "clarion call" for Johnston's army to defend the city at any cost: "The time has come when retreat will no longer be strategy but disaster. It must therefore give place to battle" the Enquirer stated. The battle will mark a turning point as Confederate fighters dash the hopes of Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan of seizing Richmond. And it won't be Johnston but the pugnacious Robert E. Lee who will save Richmond and force McClellan to retreat in the fighting just ahead. Elsewhere 150 years ago in the war, Confederate forces defending the northeast Mississippi railroad junction at Corinth, Miss., withdraw rather than surrender to Union soldiers closing in on that city. The Confederates leave behind miles of earthworks defending the approaches to Corinth and a key rail crossing for train lines serving nearly the entire South.

The "slicks" began to fold in the late 1950s and Vonnegut gave up writing so many short stories. Ever resourceful, he turned to paperback originals, and the burgeoning science fiction market.

"I was trying to be in character," she explained, her eyes a little misty. "But, see, I'm a happy person and Bleez is angry, and the best I can do is indifference. Maybe this isn't me."

The night of the incident, Collins praised county police for their intervention in arresting the suspected drug dealers. But the next day, the town's mayor, Sylvester Caldwell, and Pine Lawn police Lt. Dan O'Connor called a news conference and blasted county police for not notifying them of the undercover operation. Collins was not at the news conference.

Emanuel also said he’s sorry if people who have planned events like weddings downtown while the meetings are going on might be inconvenienced or forced to reschedule because of the crowds, traffic and security concerns.
I learned from several of the regulars that his band Ff was not to be missed and I soon found myself a rabid fan, attending every show, even dragging my brother from the suburbs into clubs he was way too young to frequent (nobody carded in those days) in order to witness them for himself. Ff were the band we had been waiting for: they were both dissonant and melodic, raw and sophisticated, heavy and brutal but tender and heartfelt. Sonically, they had struck a perfect middle-ground between Nirvana, the Minutemen, Husker Du, and Fugazi, with, remarkably, the Beatles and some Rush thrown in for good measure. Though a high school dropout, Tom's lyrics had a linguistic depth beyond most college grads: they were poetic, sometimes funny, and always illustrated a vast understanding and empathy for whatever human condition he made his topic. Like great songs are supposed to do, his sad ones comforted, the happy ones uplifted, and the powerful ones made you want to break things (though it should be noted that Tom gave up smashing guitars and took to nice Les Pauls a few years later). Their live shows were a simultaneously rock-solid yet unpredictable experience in sonic freefall featuring pounding musicality, avant-garde noise bursts, saturated distortion and feedback, Tom's commanding presence, humor and onstage catharsis, and, rising above all else, beautiful melody. Every show was a surprise, every show was moving. Ff were fully realized Whole Music.

I've learned to take a walk outside most days and watch for the wildlife. Wherever you go, big city or out in the country, it's always there if you just take the time to look. In my daily walkabouts I've experienced bobcats, prairie dogs, many species of marine mammals, and birds, deer, and numerous other in-the-wild critters. All were found serendipitously during my walks, and all gave me a mental escape that you just can't get from watching TV or hanging out in a bar.

PLAINFIELD — A 24-year-old man was seriously injured last night after being shot in the chest in Plainfield, police said.
One significant nit: an overly ambitious sound design introduces the production with a montage of news clips from 1963 and 1964 (the play's period) and then separates each scene with too-loud music that is church-y but not particular to this piece. "Doubt" is a lean and subtle meditation that requires little adornment. Its power is unmistakable.
Kay Sagmiller, director of Southern Oregon University's Center for Teaching, Learning and Assessment, says Sollinger's art exemplifies "how creative minds are able to transcend the boundaries of disciplines and develop new inquiries."
�The tax would drive cosmetic surgery abroad. After New Jersey adopted a 6% tax on cosmetic surgery in 2004, many patients went to New York or Pennsylvania for procedures, says Dr. Renato Saltz, president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. A federal excise tax would have the same effect, but patients would go to Thailand, Mexico or Costa Rica, he says. "We already see a lot of complications from surgeries performed overseas," he says.

Prices here are cheap, cheap, cheap, with rooms starting at $59 in the low season and $79 in summer. This Victorian-style hotel, built in 1904, has nicely decorated public areas and rooms furnished in period style. Some rooms are tiny (the petite queen, which has the lowest rate, is about 150 square feet, slightly larger than a standard stateroom on a ship), but you can't beat the central location, and there's a free continental breakfast.
The officials deemed King's late second-period hit on Pietrangelo a minor penalty. The Blues begged to differ. Now the matter is in the hands of Brendan Shanahan, the NHL's disciplinary czar. Blues fans have been outraged by some of his earlier rulings involving this team, so this will be interesting.
The Obama administration could face a political issue when the visa allowing the younger Mr. Bo to remain in the U.S. as a student runs out. It isn't known when the visa expires.

Rodgers was sailing along with a 1.12 ERA three weeks ago after a win over USC and threatening Bannister's school single-season record (1.45, 1976). Then he gave up six earned runs in 5 1/3 innings April 20 in a loss at Stanford and four earned runs in 6 1/3 innings last week in a win at Washington State. That's one more earned run (10) than in his nine other starts combined.

The abstract of a 1997 study by researchers at New York University Medical Center, whose findings appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association, states that "One consequence of reliance on reputation is that a small group of prominent hospitals in each specialty receives such high scores that they automatically rise to the top of the rankings, regardless of structure or outcome score."

Yet Sentilles endures it all, and she emerges at memoir's end with her own intellectual position. The problem is, it was hard to be interested in it. She has a grating way of talking about her discoveries about faith — she acts as if she's the first to make them. I was relieved to finish the book, but not before hoping she might find her way back to that community at All Saints and settle for proof of God's existence in a simple bowl of soup.
“Everyone loves a little black dress – so why not a little black wedding dress?” added Kristin Banta of Kristin Banta Events in Los Angeles, who has one client wearing a black Vera Wang dress in November and another who wore a white gown with chic black detailing in August. “I’m seeing brides taking risks and moving away from white,” she said.

What I'm talking about is a form of hand-to-hand combat once reserved for the Israeli military and law enforcement but now practiced by civilians worldwide through an official licensing program. The name consists of two Hebrew words, the first of which rhymes with "Slav" and the second of which sounds like "macaw," with the stress on the second syllable.
It was an ambitious deadline. Christie gave the Legislature just over 100 days to pass major changes to public workers’ pension and health benefits, the state’s ethics laws, the education system and the state’s business climate — all on top of his 33-measure "tool kit" package to help towns curtail property taxes in advance of the 2 percent limit on property tax growth set to take effect January 1.
Rangers also discourage people from hiking in the dark, but many do. L.V.

They drew, largely, from the Basie, Rich and Sinatra songbooks, with the horn players — wearing matching suits and positioned behind matching music stands decorated with the Max Weinberg Big Band logo — taking virtuosic solos. Weinberg was, as usual, a powerful, driving force, and spoke earnestly about the music between numbers. He confessed that it was “unnerving,” for instance, to attempt Rich’s parts on “Parthenia.”

The goal for this introduction to fall wines is "Center of the Pocket, Easy Drinkin' Reds." We're in a drinker's market right now with California, Washington and the rest of the world producing delicious, affordable juice -- one bit of good news during these financially difficult times. The words "grocery-store reds" are no longer derogatory, as clean technology and science have greatly expanded the areas in the world where good wines can be made. As the emerging vineyards are developed at a lower cost of entry, the savings get passed on to the consumer. Add to this the care and passion of most winemakers and we have a winning formula to recognize, embrace and enjoy.

But, as I said, most of the time I saw the gentleman from his back." "So I don't know what was going on in the front. But also he kept telling him repeatedly.

Two champagne glasses had been placed on a small table in front of French doors that framed a gorgeous view of the tree-lined shores of Lake Nipissing.
Once again, there were many exceptionally inspiring performances from a large group of high school student-athletes.
To arrive at the annual estimates, the bureau totals its initial calculations for all cities, villages and townships in each county. Then the bureau adjusts all places up or down at the same rate so the total equals the more accurately determined county population estimate.
There are levels of complexity, finesse and balance in our recommended wines, which are somewhat similar between our top domestic bottlings and the imported Champagne submitted for our tasting. In fact, a few local bottlings beat the pants off their French counterparts. Though we had several popular Champagne brands in the tasting, many didn't deliver as much for the money as their American counterparts.

At this point, I'm a lot more concerned about Chris Carpenter's availability to start against the Padres on March 31.
Not exactly what the soak-the-rich types from "Occupy Wall Street" want to hear. Not exactly what someone raking and scraping to make ends meet wants to hear, either.

Although the Wildcats started three freshmen and two sophomores, speculation that this team might wind up having five or six first-round picks in the NBA draft this summer meant there was no time to lose. In addition, the time seemed right for Calipari to finish with a flourish.
On the regulatory front, Bair reiterated her agency's bid to require banks to hold more capital as a buffer against rough times, even if it eventually reduces the amount of funds available to lend. She said the requirement would not only protect banks but could also help prevent asset bubbles by reducing excess credit in the financial system.
The two also at times seemed like strangers during their lunch with students. Romney asked one student if he decided to attend Otterbein to follow in Kasich's footsteps. Kasich regularly notes that he attended Ohio State University, the very reason he came to Ohio from Pennsylvania four decades ago.

Boeing said its profit and revenue expectations for the full year are unchanged, with a profit of $3.80 to $4 per share and revenue of $68 billion to $71 billion. It still expects to deliver the new 787 during the third quarter and the freighter version of its new 747-8 in mid-2011.

"There comes a point where you can't ignore something, not because it's entertaining -- which he was on a lot of levels," said Candy Crowley, the anchor of "State of the Union" on CNN who did an early interview with Mr. Trump. "The question was, ‘Is he driving the conversation?' And he was."
Because the case is so big, it will need to proceed outside the regular track of Superior Court cases, Manahan said.
After the information transfers to a centralized computer, the clerk of courts' office will process and mail a citation to the homeowner within about two weeks of the infraction. The homeowner will have 20 days to contest it or pay the fine. After 60 days, unpaid fines will be sent to collections.
Born Donald Mulvihill, he was managing such Manhattan clubs in the late '70s as Kenny’s Castaways and the Bitter End. In 1984, Hill became the manager and talent booker at the Cat Club in the East Village. The hotspot was known to feature musicians like Jane's Addiction, David Bowie and Duran Duran.
The white-haired senior and dark, curly-haired daughter move through the hospital, from patient to patient and room to room, with an ease born of their similar personalities. They get and give hugs (or “schmooze” as they call it), read X-rays and pore over charts, conferring about end-stage cancers and perplexing blood disorders.
Moody's notice this week states that for the first nine months of 2011 MetroHealth reported an operating loss – which doesn't include investment income but is just the amount it earns caring for patients -- of $1.5 million. That's down from a profit of $22.9 million for the same period last year.

"There are 74, I believe, attorneys in that office," Batchelder said on the Ohio News Network's "Capitol Square" on May 29. "Is that duplicative? Is it wasteful? And I think since the legislature was busy with an axe on everything else, it makes it pretty hard to sell having the duplication or having 74 lawyers. I don't know how many the attorney general has."
Keep it together she did. Cohen went on to defeat Salpointe's Lauren Amos 6-4, 4-6, 6-3.
Rather than bring you a Jell-O shot recipe here, I've chosen to highlight the Prince of Wales' Cocktail, a sort of Champagne cocktail with extra character. It's the kind of cocktail that Wondrich loves best. The formula is credited to Albert Edward, Queen Victoria's somewhat wayward son, and a man who might have actually stood on the other side of the mahogany from Jerry Thomas himself during an 1860 visit to New York. One of the accounts cited by Wondrich has Thomas getting pretty upset with the good prince. Is it possible that The Prince of Wales forgot his royal wallet?
Many teens today have no knowledge of the dangers of heroin. "Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same fear factor today as it did back then," Lindberg said.

But at least the military has the satisfaction of knowing it has pacified Berkeley High, even as Iraq continues its nightmarish descent into chaos.
espoused for low TV ratings for postseason baseball is that when "big name'' teams aren't involved, viewers have little connection with upstarts because they haven't seen them much on the big networks during the regular season as they concentrate on the big-market clubs. Case in point this weekend: The Yankees entertain the Red Sox and MLB Network shows the Friday contest, Fox has it as its feature game Saturday and ESPN beams the Sunday night matchup nationally.
They've made nice use of the space that has previously housed a litany of enterprises -- among them, La Boca Barrio, Roseangel, La Boca, Krazy Mac's Cafe, Cheddar's, Snickers and Lou & Eddy's. Spicy colors splash the walls, there's a new look to the bar, and rooms are slightly reconfigured. It all comes together for a nice effect, given that there was never any set plan to open a restaurant.
To set this advertisement next to the endorsement prologue is both audacious and, from a journalistic perspective, unconscionable. WW may not be "writing about this race," but the weekly is campaigning for Rosenblum in no uncertain terms.

"One of the good things about bamboo is that it's a vigorous, happy plant, but a downside is that it gets root-bound more quickly," he said. "It's easy, though, to take it out, divide and repot it. Most of the stems are hollow, making it light and portable in containers."
Cornwell's story reminds us of the perilous condition of nationhood and identity in those distant times and of Viking power that, if it had remained unchallenged, could have turned the British Isles into some kind of Norse colony or outpost. Though readers have the benefit of historical hindsight, the players in Cornwell's story certainly have no idea how God (the Norse or Christian version) will determine their fates.

Indian food is often a good bet for vegetarians, as we discovered many months back at the humble but delicious Udupi Cafe in Rancho Cordova. Bombay has several meatless options; one we enjoyed was the vegetable korma, a dish based on a sauce flavored with cashews and nutmeg. This unassuming item turned out to be one of our favorites, a winning combination of soothing and subtle and complex.
Prohibiting certain clothing also eliminates class differentiation, keeps costs lower for some parents and puts an end to inappropriate dressing, he said.

The Netanyahus moved back and forth between the United States and the fledgling state of Israel after it was founded. Israeli academia, however, did not embrace the scholar, whose right-wing beliefs went against the grain of the prevalent socialist thinking, and he continued his scholarship with various American universities, finally becoming a professor emeritus at Cornell University.
"There are certain spousal assets that are required to be filed on the federal report that were never required on the state report," the spokesman, Joe Aquilino, repeated to The Plain Dealer on Tuesday. He was referring to the report Mandel filed as state treasurer, which is in fact less detailed than the one required by the U.S. Senate.

These social issues played into the character, too — and helped make Dracula a monster for his age.
He's a better "value" pick with the Blazers' second choice, but in a few years no one will care when he was selected. Marshall has the kind of game that Batum needs to play at his best -- someone who can find Batum sprinting or slashing so he does not need but a few dribbles to score. Matthews and Aldridge, too, would benefit from a great passer, and Marshall might be the best passing prospect in a decade.
"No GM can do whatever he wants," said Mychal Thompson, a former Blazers No. 1 overall draft pick and current radio analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers. "He always has to answer to someone.

No. 23 Detroit Lions: OT Riley Reiff, Iowa – Reiff bounced around the line as a freshman, playing at various spots before replacing Bryan Bulaga (a first-round pick of the Packers) at left tackle as a sophomore. Reiff started all 13 games at left tackle as a junior before deciding to turn pro. If there’s a knock on him, it’s that his arms are a tad shorter than typical for a left tackle.

Since we've done the legwork, we might as well consider what qualifies Staub to run for office in New Jersey. Well, she already has a criminal record, so she's ahead on that count. Her hobbies, according to her "Real Housewives of New Jersey" co-stars, include lying, gossip-mongering, and sex in inappropriate places. We can see how those skill sets could work in Washington, D.C.
Hermann said Hargreaves' complaint was a "cruel irony" in a case where all parties – judge, prosecutor and defense attorney – agreed to a solution that they believed best protected the public and the defendant.
Wyman, the attorney, said working through Oregon's land-use system is like raising children -- but requires even more patience. It's crucial to understand the process, he said.
Even if doctors weren't short on time, the country is short on board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrists, the physicians best-trained to diagnose and treat child mental health problems. This shortage puts pressure on child psychiatrists to increase their patient loads, which then reduces the amount of time they can spend with individual patients.
Laguna Niguel's Orly Taitz, known for her legal challenges of Barack Obama's birth certificate, came in third at 5.5 percent of Republicans. That means Taitz trailed even Feinstein among GOP voters – 6.6 percent of them picked the incumbent.
The cuts are part of an overhaul aimed at focusing on what Thompson believes are Yahoo's strengths while also trying to address its weaknesses in the increasingly important mobile computing market.
Census data doesn't reflect this, the report said, because Vista Los Mares is lumped together with affluent neighborhoods around it. Vista Los Mares residents are 83 percent Latino, 62 percent of the adults didn't finish high school, and children have no nearby schools, parks or recreation centers, so they play on the streets.

But Schroeder, in a conversation Thursday after Gingrich spoke to Asian American business leaders in Koreatown, said he also had a goal that he was less vocal about: “I wanted to force the Republican Party to campaign to minorities.

"Track is an individual sport but it's a team sport, too," said Liberty head coach Perry Beeler, who added that Buckley will likely continue to triple jump, at least through the regular season. "To have an athlete come out for just one event is not what we're trying to foster here. We're trying to foster a team atmosphere. So yeah, we do want him to triple jump. He's our top triple jumper and he's been doing it kind of half-heartedly because he is good at high jump, that is his passion."

She tried out in December, made the team and had so much fun, she dragged her younger sister along to rookie camp in February. With Jack on offense and Horrell playing defense, old sibling antagonisms tend to get a workout.
In the 1970s, inflation soared when the Fed printed too much money. Once the Fed re-established its inflation-fighting credentials in the 1980s, though, we had a long period of growth with low inflation.
At most weddings, it seems as though the food is an afterthought. A menu consisting of the four options given to you by the venue or the old catering standbys of chicken, steak and a painfully bland vegetarian selection. In no way was that going to fly at the wedding of two people who could spend a week straight touring the city in search of the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint. The mission statement of our wedding, from the moment we started planning, has been that we want everyone in attendance to have as much fun as we do. I want each guest to feel like we have experienced something special together, not that they were there purely because we had seats to fill. And the fare is to be no exception.

So how does this derail the president's plan? The supporters' very thin rationale is that a vote against mandates from Ohio voters will influence the court's decision. But while Supreme Court justices clearly are aware of the nation's political environment, the idea that a plebiscite in Ohio will tip their deliberations seems, at best, a long shot -- and little reason to clutter up this state's Constitution.

2. Each university’s football corporation could create leagues, whether long- or short-term, with other corporations. There wouldn’t have to be any allegiance to geography, fan loyalties or tradition. For example, some of these leagues could be premised on budget size.

"We'll welcome him with open arms if he comes back out here and puts the work in," Sullivan said. "If he helps us win, we're all for it.

Our job as players is to welcome him back here, encourage him and rally around him so we can have a successful 2012 season."
This left Naia Kete, Charlotte Sometimes and Jordis Unga to fight for their coach's affection. It was a real morale crusher when Carson Daly stood the group together and called them the bottom three. Prepped to sing a song of their own choosing for Coach Blake, these three women took their sudden fall pretty hard. We're talking a mess of mascara and tears. Naia was the most collected of the three, possibly because she performed Beyoncé's "If I Were a Boy" and was still method-acting as if she were one. It was her best showing in a while. Blake was disappointed she didn't do something reggae and Naia, offering us a secret insight to the show, blurted out, "I swear to God they wouldn't let me! There's only so many songs." Apparently the contestants are strong-armed into picking their songs from a small list that the band has already prearranged. It could be worse. Blake Shelton could've provided a list and Naia would have been stuck choosing between Kim Carnes and a Glass Tiger song.
Bommarito told a Post-Dispatch reporter that he called police Sgt. Tony Aubuchon to keep Campo from going to jail after he was arrested on suspicion of DWI in Soulard during Mardi Gras. Aubuchon later delivered Campo to Tony's, the iconic fine restaurant downtown where Bommarito is proprietor.

"It contains significant cuts while holding the line at the critical investments that help our economy grow. But as we take our next steps in reducing the deficit we must look at the entire budget and not just the small slice devoted to spending on programs like education and workforce development.

øWhy the Senators like the deal: Turris, 22, was the third overall pick in the 2007 draft and there is still hope that he could blossom into a high yield offensive center. The Senators desperately need a No. 2 center. They have been lacking at the position since dealing Mike Fisher last season. When Turris was drafted, scouts thought he had the potential to be a Joe Sakic-style offensive force. At 20, he had 26 goals and 39 assists during a full season in the American Hockey League. Turris looked like he was ready to emerge late last season. After not playing for two months because of a contract dispute, Turris is still trying to get his game up to NHL speed. This trade was made for both the present and the future. The Senators see him as a skillful player to bolster their refurbishing effort. Turris is a right-shot center, and those are always in demand.

I ranked Aybar 12th at shortstop in the preseason. His average may be low now, but I see no reason why that should continue - his skills appear the same, and he's 28 so his speed should still be there. Stolen bases can be fickle, and they will come. Also, he was just signed to a new contract extension so his slump won't be keeping him out of the lineup.
"I'm just trying to stay focused on basketball, and I think the schedule helps because the games come so fast,'' Lin said.

When this committee was considering Clear Skies, the Administration actually did full modeling runs on the legislation we planned to markup. As with Clear Skies, it is appropriate and well taken that the committee get full modeling runs on the bill before us.

Often, the West Coast swing seems to cheat loyal fans. A first pitch that comes after 10 p.m. in the East means only a few innings for those who can't sleep in or who don't react to caffeine like a racehorse to the starting bell.

Sure, the Wildcats have five, maybe six players who will wind up in the NBA next season. But with great talent can come great headaches for a head coach.

Backup wide receivers Rashied Davis and Maurice Stovall are still on the market. The Lions didn't add anyone at the position in free agency.

The program opened with another world premiere: "Mass Transmission" for chorus, organ soloist (Paul Jacobs, ubiquitous at this festival) and electronica. The latter was handled by composer Mason Bates (performing on his laptop), whose new work -- conducted here by Donato Cabrera -- draws on 1920s transcripts of long-distance radio conversations between Dutch parents and their children in colonial-era Java. Well-intended, it's a gigantic misfire, this piece: cloying, draping sentiment in prettiness.

The butter for guns swap faces a veto threat from the White House and rejection by the Democratic Senate, which say the GOP measure unfairly hits the middle-class and the poor.

"If I did have a snorer, I would jab them awake -- repeatedly if necessary -- and notify a flight attendant," says Janine Johnson.

I was enticed to join several organizational meetings and even participate in a march through the streets of Cleveland.
