He gets the vibe and the delights of Marvel comic books in the same way that Spielberg and Lucas intuitively understood the appeal of serials in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." You don't have to be a comics fan to have a great time (although it sure couldn't hurt) but you may need a reminder of everything that's gone down in the previous Marvel movies.

Q: I'm curious about the rankings of Lance Lynn and Eduardo Sanchez. Given that these two guys, esp. Lynn, have not only shown that they can be successful in the big leagues, but on the biggest stage against the best teams in MLB, why are they ranked lower than so many of the others? I'm not arguing with Shelby Miller as the Cards #1 prospect, mind you. But, it seems like demonstrated ML success should rank Lynn, and perhaps Sanchez (though with his extended visit to the DL, I can see ranking him lower), higher in the order than they are currently. So, I'm just curious as to the reasoning behind the decisions and how much weight is placed on proven, if short term, success compared to other variables, such as upside/potential. Thanks!

"All batteries deliver their power via a chemical reaction inside the battery that releases electrons.

Questionable Calls: There were a few. Hughes looks like a massive reach in the third round, and it's debatable as to whether general manager Tom Heckert needed to spend a first-round pick on Weeden when he would have likely been still available at Cleveland's No. 37 spot.

And since Minnesota wasn't going to take Richardson at No. 3, trading up a place seemed like a needless move.

This is set against a backdrop of more obvious political intrigue, with Essex (Sam Reid) and Southampton (Xavier Samuel) plotting a coup that proves disastrous. And there is another subplot involving the bastard children of the "virgin" queen. All of this ties together, sort of, in John Orloff's screenplay, but it's not a neat fit.

Some people believe paying off a mortgage is a stupid move, and would advise us to forgo the mortgage prepayments and invest that $395 a month elsewhere.

California is the most populous state. Its economy -- both agriculture and high-tech -- is enormous.

Understandable, but wrong. Creating a two-tier system of fees sets a serious precedent that could change the basic nature of the community college system. Once a handful of courses pay for themselves, the temptation to add more would be hard to resist, and the temptation for other campuses to join in would be overwhelming. College fees are set by the Legislature and overseen by the systemwide chancellor's office in Sacramento. A single campus should not have the authority — and it's doubtful it does — to set the price for a community college education.

While the Vikings want to build a 65,000-seat stadium in the Ramsey County city of Arden Hills, the project took a political torpedo Tuesday when Dayton announced there was not enough legislative support for exempting the requirement for a referendum on any local sales tax increase to help fund the stadium.

Hey, Tom: The Cavs have cap space, but there are few quality unrestricted free agents at their position of need (shooting guard, small forward) coming up this summer.

It's unnerving watching your town in crisis. Surreal might be an even better word.

Have you ever seen such a lackluster, uninspiring group of challengers in your life? I really try not to pay too much attention to labels such as Democrat or Republican, as the parties have more in common than differences. That being said, are there no moderate, innovative, bold thinkers with good communication skills in the GOP? Can they deliver a candidate who does not believe that blacks and Latinos are all looking for a handout? Apparently not, so they had to resurrect three Lazarus-like candidates in Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney.

I doubt it. The commitment to the passing game is there, but I think Ohio State spreads it around too much for any receiver to become the first Buckeye to reach 1,000 receiving yards since Michael Jenkins in 2002. Dane Sanzenbacher is on a pace for 890 yards, DeVier Posey for 789. I expect Posey's numbers to increase, but not enough to get him to 1,000, and remember tight end Jake Stoneburner has been out the last two weeks and is expected to return against Wisconsin, providing another option. I do think Terrelle Pryor could be Ohio State's first 3,000-yard passer since Joe Germaine in 1998.

Do you think President Barack Obama's economic policies are working?
Knoph and I were sipping wine at tables set up for a barbecue lunch on the Serengeti Plain of Tanzania. The horizon was infinite and the wildlife abundant. Our group's average age was, I'd say, somewhere in the 60s. Many people had traveled extensively for business but seldom had taken the time to do it for pleasure. Virtually all had been super achievers, whether it was in the corporate world or as independent businesspeople, lawyers, inventors or entrepreneurs. The majority traveled with spouses. Money and politics were never discussed.
Kinghorn and the districts agree that the economy is the driving force behind the slowdown. People aren't moving as much. They might be reluctant to buy new homes if they have recently lost a job or fear that they lack job security.
Given the rocky history and what's at stake, the Istanbul meeting is an important moment, she said. But she added that no one should expect it to produce a "light-bulb moment … or a clear guide path for a sustainable process of dialogue."

Dench did admit that India's startling gap "between almost unbelievable wealth and equally unbelievable desperate poverty - worse than I'd seen anywhere - was a difficult thing to accept ... especially since those two extremes usually exist in such close proximity to one another."
There was positive news from SAP, a major business software maker based in Germany. SAP said its fourth-quarter revenue fell less than forecast, providing some reassurance that companies are becoming more willing to invest in technology.

Far better to consider legal, nonviolent methods to rally a missing-in-action team member when the stakes are high and you lack authority to issue direct orders.
The Cocoa Couture Fashion Show will showcase the vision of more than 18 up-and-coming clothing designers who used candy-bar wrappers to create dresses that will be modeled on The Yumway today at 8 p.m. The one-of-a-kind dresses will be on display throughout the weekend so that guests can vote for their "Fan Favorite."

"People in San Francisco look around them and the ground looks very stable," Slovic says. "It's hard to imagine the experience of the ground shaking such that buildings collapse and bridges fall. There is no sense of imminent danger. It's an invisible hazard, a figment. There's a sense of unreality to it."
At Bahia Honda State Park, at Mile Marker 36.8 in the Lower Keys, re-enactments commemorating the railroad's completion will be staged through March.

No mere mortal can possibly keep up with all these deals. The only way for an average traveler to stay in the loop and still have a life is to sign up for one or more of the many (almost entirely electronic) travel newsletters and deal bulletins. Some, including those issued by SmarterTravel.com (the source that posts my columns), cover a broad spectrum of airfare, hotel, cruise, and tour deals; those from individual airlines, hotel chains, and others highlight their own promotions, and the big online travel agencies notify you when airfares drop to someplace you have specified. Notifications can be by email, twitter, smart phone app, or RSS feed, through some combination of your computer, smart phone, and tablet.

Certainly, the government is responsible for the well-being of children while they're in school.

Riley talked up Luck, and the Cardinal, during his Tuesday media availability at the Valley Center. Stanford (8-0, 6-0) is riding a nation-leading 16-game winning streak. The Cardinal are 28-5 when Luck starts and as if they don't have enough going for them Saturday, it stands to reason Luck wants to avenge what happened in his redshirt freshman year when the Beavers surprised the Cardinal 38-28 at Reser on a day Quizz went crazy and Luck looked all too human.

Cribbs knows as much as anyone what this rivalry means to Browns fans. Maybe that’s part of the reason he is always dangerous in Steelers games. Injured most of the year, starting with a concussion delivered on a hit by James Harrison in the first meeting, Cribbs appears healthier than at any time in the past two months. Cribbs can make a difference, like he did in last year’s upset win over the frozen Steelers.
This development underscores something Lananna said Tuesday in response to a question I asked about Oregon's apparent strength on the form charts: "I hope you're right.

For a second I thought she was still all good, kind of like when Daryl came back from his vision quest and was all beat up. I thought she was going to be like, "I was scared so I hid out in that barn all this time with all those monsters in there. I was sleeping in the hay that Glenn and Maggie were going to bump uglies in and eating Naked Tenders from the gimpy chickens that Patricia was wheel-barrowing in here."
She puts on a good show. And since the Prefontaine Classic won't include the women's hammer this year, there might not be many chances for fans to watch her compete in Eugene before the USA Championships.

When these small statuettes were made, beginning in the 15th century, however, their object was much more ambitious. “The people who collected bronze figurines believed that looking at beauty would awaken virtue,” says Denise Allen, curator at the Frick who worked with Claudia Kryza-Gersch of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and Eleonora Luciano of the National Gallery to organize this show. “These were small symbols of antique grandeur, meant to inspire their owners to a greatness in action they might never have imagined otherwise.”

Both of my children have been victims of bullying, both physical and verbal, including cyberbullying, from children they did not know, as well as from supposed "friends" and, yes, even at the hands of those adults who have pledged to protect them.

Is it time to question the coaching staff? You can go there, but you have to give them some time to work with a roster that’s filled with children. Still, it begs to be asked: For a guy who constantly preaches discipline and order, why does Coughlin’s team seem to step on the rake at the worst time — amateurish penalties, late hits, interceptions, all of it.

"Is your last name really pronounced Dumb? Maybe sitting at a computer mindlessly typing in whatever thought blows between those two over-sized ears onto the screen is the 'toughest job,' simply because of the struggle to convince others that it is in fact a 'job' and that you should be paid for it. Does Dumb even have a child with Dumb's unattractive lesbian lover or does Dumb only speculate about what it is like to raise one?; or, if Dumb does have a child, does Dumb drop Dumb's child off at daycare all day so that others can do the job Dumb is supposed to be doing?"

A: "We gave them quite a bit. It was fast paced really. We tried to give them everything for the most part. I'd say there was probably only about 10 percent that we didn't give them. And then we've just got to try to improve on all of those things as we go in the fall. But our intent was to expose them to as much as possible. So we've put in most of the defense."

The lowdown: The Ducks face an upper-echelon team in the conference for the first time this season. Oregon, which swept ASU last weekend, has been winning with pitching and defense but the Ducks will have their work cut out for them this weekend. The Bruins are coming off a three-game sweep at Utah in which they scored 30 runs. UCLA ranks second in the conference in batting average (.312) and third in runs scored (176). UCLA outfielder Jeff Gelalich is batting a team-best .415 with six home runs and 21 RBIs. Catcher Tyler Heineman is batting .400 with 18 RBIs. UCLA also has a strong pitching staff with a team ERA of 3.29. That ranks fourth in the Pac-12. Oregon has come up with clutch hits this season but hasn't scared anyone in conference with its offense. But the Ducks' pitching staff is indeed frightening. Oregon ranks second in the conference in team ERA (2.94). That number probably needs to hold true for them to win the series at UCLA.

​If there were a Holy Trinity of downtown Newark eats, Hobby’s would be included. Longtime Jewish deli/luncheonette still pickles its legendary corned beef in 50-gallon stainless steel vats.

In its way, Cooks County, the new restaurant from chef Daniel Mattern and pastry chef Roxana Jullapat, may seem more of the moment than a place like Ink, which is engaged in the restless mutation that modernism needs to survive.
