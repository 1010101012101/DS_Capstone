Other non-Korean Asian Americans I spoke to back then felt the same confusion. Solidarity?

"In the U.S., we have more than a dozen major hospitals doing clinical studies," Hologic spokesman James D. Culley says. Each center's research focuses on a different facet of the technology, such as whether it is possible to diagnose cancer with 3-D alone, or in conjunction with 2-D; what type of training radiologists need; and if the amount of breast compression is less than with digital mammography, he says.
Handler, 42, says Sendak has been so much a part of his life he can't think of a time he wasn't aware of him. Sendak's books were all over his room and in his home today.

Sendak's genius is how he weaves together the real and the magical without telling you which is which.
Guinness World Records: The Board Game (Haywire, $30; 2-6 players; age 8+; 30 min.) If nothing else, this one sets a record for most extraneous paraphernalia bundled with a game. There's a rope, dominoes, marbles, a standard deck of cards and more - all so players can occasionally try to do little bar-bet stunts in between failing to answer trivia questions about world records. What no one seems to have realized is that weird records don't make fun trivia, because they're not things that people know.

One of the many tasks that law enforcement has undertaken in the course of the investigation of the disappearance of Kyron Horman has been to try and determine as definitely as possible the identity of every individual who was on the Skyline School campus at any time between 8:00 am and noon on June 4, 2010. This has proved a more complex endeavor than one might think. Many sources of information have been consulted. To date, law enforcement has identified 490 people who were present. In order to ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that this is a complete and accurate list, one of the remaining steps we feel is necessary is to share that list with you, the members of the Skyline Community, and ask you to examine it and inform us of:

As the burned-out buildings multiply, look more disfigured, more abstract as they collapse upon themselves, the stories become more tragic. Like the little boy who's decided not to leave the cement back yard behind his house because 'I don't want to get caught by no police. I don't want to have to go through that.' There is Francis, bewildered, who stands in front of the Church of God of Prophecy on Western, watching his electronics business smoulder: 'What ... do ... I ... feel?' he asks the dead space before him. 'What do I feel now? Upset. Angry. We as black people have been told that we could achieve anything if we put our mind to it. Now, because of a couple of days, it's going to take twenty or thirty years before we can achieve anything again. People here complain about South Africa. It is no better here.' 'The arrogance of Gates, I believe, caused the whole thing', a security guard tells me as we watch a van pull up full of teens, loading up bottles of soda and alcohol. One offers me a cool drink.

Footnotes. Todd Helton accomplished something on this road trip that might not be matched this season.

Renck's take:Other than Barry Bonds, I have never witnessed a better hitter than Pujols. Pujols has an amazing ability to get his front foot down on time, allowing him to clear his hips and generate ridiculous power because the bat stays flat in the strike zone so long. I haven't seen that swing this season. Pujols has adopted a desperate approach, crouching in his stance while becoming pull-happy. These are the hallmarks of a slumping player. I am not surprised that Pujols has struggled, just that it has gone on this long. It's impossible to overstate how easy life was for him in St. Louis. He was to the Cardinals what LeBron was to the Cavaliers. He answered to no one, other than manager Tony La Russa. His flaws were overlooked, his grumpiness ignored. He could do what he wanted, his greatness providing the eternal hall pass. Now, everything is different. To his credit, he has remained surprisingly upbeat, understanding how important first impressions are. Pujols will get hot as soon as he starts driving the ball to the opposite field. But his lost April means his first season will be modest — 30 home runs, 90 RBIs, .310 average — not memorable.

PHILADELPHIA -- Skinny, colored jeans are more than this spring's fashion must-have -- they are becoming the apparel industry's savior.
But it did. And there was Diehl along with his teammates getting a key to New York City from Mayor Michael Bloomberg. That was his favorite part of the day because it gave him hope he could “walk around and do what I want whenever.” (Plaxico Burress found out nine months after Bloomberg gave him the key that wasn’t the case. But we digress.)
McKenzie said she likes to jump on the family's backyard trampoline, and lets the chickens out of their pen to roam the yard and keep her company. Karinna, who doesn't particularly enjoy holding the chickens, loves the "wonderful, comforting sounds they make."
Regarding "School funding plan stumbles" (April 29): The last sentence of the article sums up the problem. We need legislators with common sense to craft the needed legislation for school funding, and a few other educational reforms as well. Politics needs to take a back seat because no county or political district in Missouri is independent of the rest of the state.
Records show that the teacher who resigned, Sue Beckstrom, denied allegations of reviewing students' writing exams, making suggestions to them and writing in their test booklets. She could not be reached for comment.

Trustee John M. Morrison will lead the search committee for Dease's successor, who for the first time will not have to be a priest.
Don’t confuse soul singer Mike Posner with rapper Sam Adams. Yes, they both leapt straight from the frat house to the pop charts without the assistance of a major recording company. But while Adams’ laddish appeal wears off with the beer buzz, Posner is the real deal: a raspyvoiced synthpop specialist with an ear for a hook and an eye on your girl. He’s knocked ’em dead at the Warped Tour, Bamboozle and Bonnaroo, and “Cooler Than Me,” a kiss-off directed at a fashion victim who refuses to go out with the singer, has insinuated its way into the Billboard top 10. Expect him to be a regular presence on the pop charts for the next few years, and catch him while he’s still playing small stages.

But Allice has always considered himself more than a coach. "I tell coaches you're in the entertainment business," Allice said. "You prepare people to do their best, put them on a stage that allows them to perform and then you open the curtain. You make them feel just as important as anyone else."

After a vehicle catches your eye, isnt that the first thing most people want to know  Can I afford it? But the auto show doesnt give you much help; you have to go on-line or visit a dealer. The DIA at least has a Rembrandt gift shop at the end of the exhibit, with everything plainly marked.
A: I'm not sure even Ronny would say he deserves minutes ahead of Udonis. Yes, the shot has not been nearly as reliable this season, but the rebounding remains essential.
While valley icons HP and Apple famously grew out of garages, life science start-ups typically emerge from the laboratories of university research hospitals.

He was Genentech's chairman for 14 years.

Which is not to say one can't still occasionally find an excellent slice in town. Our adventure took us through five local pizzerias. Levine awarded each one up to four pies or slices, depending on how the restaurant serves its pizza.
Forget the flowers and fruitcake this holiday season when you offer gifts to your favorite hostesses. They want tools.
* The Rams' three-game London Calling series will presumably hurt the team's standing in St. Louis. For obvious reasons, some that we've already discussed here today. (Namely: the growing perception, fair or unfair, that he's angling to move.) But by announcing the series now, Kroenke has succeeded in killing much of the positive buzz generated by the hiring of Fisher. And the Rams are also taking their most attractive 2012 home game away from St. Louis fans, and shipping it across the pond to England. So Kroenke expects Rams fans to buy two mandatory and meaningless exhibition games as part of the season-ticket package, but he's removed a real football game (and an appealing one) from the home schedule. And the same will happen in 2013 and 2014.

Even dessert, never a Japanese-restaurant strong point, gets the chef's full attention. Nobuo made two of them: an offbeat (and surprisingly tasty) pair of mousses, chocolate-flavored tofu and green tea; and a terrific almond fritter draped in adzuki bean sauce, which supplied a sweet, caramellike touch.
In the end, the Cards couldn't get anything done against Chapman in the last two innings Wednesday. Visiting teams don't want to go into the bottom of the ninth tied at Cincinnati, especially when Joey Votto is due up.

Christie was invited to Ohio by Kasich, a former Fox News contributor, who was a close friend of the late New Jersey U.S. Rep. Bob Franks. Kasich, a godfather to one of Franks’ daughters, spent time with Christie at Franks’ memorial service earlier this year and the two said they immediately made a “connection.” Kasich said he and his supporters admire Christie’s straight talk and tell-it-like-it-is attitude.

The bad: Torey's rice was dry and the beans, she said, "weren't great ... but I'm not a bean fan." The food service can bog down, since the buffet line is in a fairly narrow space that can't accommodate more than a handful of customers before it clogs. And during the legislative off-season Griselda shortens the menu, so the place looks barren, with empty service counters and display cases that create a stark feel.

Roxbury Mayor Jim Rilee, the new council chairman who heads the personnel committee, said his “inclination to change” directors started before he was on the council. He said it was based on the lack of compensation to landowners, but, he emphasized, “We’re sworn to uphold the act as written.”

Album That Sounded Like It Was The Most Fun To Make
Until last year, the agency mailed out yearly statements that told you how much your benefits would be if you retired at age 62, 66 or 70. Social Security stopped mailing the paper statements to save an estimated $70 million a year.

"Adrian has a great work ethic. Adrian has the DNA to heal quickly, which he has shown in the past. He certainly will have the desire and the mental toughness to be able to get through the rehab process, which will take months and months, as you know. So, I think if anyone can get better quickly and safely in that time period, it would be Adrian Peterson."

It is true that some air fresheners on the market today make use of harsh chemicals to eliminate or overpower odors. "Many air fresheners contain nerve-deadening chemicals that coat your nasal passages and temporarily block your sense of smell," reports National Geographic's The Green Guide.

As someone who has been known to move past Rothko's work quickly, I found that this production of "Red" did exactly what the artist and playwright intended: It forced me to look deeper at the artist's intent. Like Rothko and Ken at various points in the play, I basked in the red light emanating from the artist's canvases.
Or with the entire Gopher nation. When Potulny scored the goal that beat Maine 4-3 in the 2002 title game, he became an instant legend.

The city already has invested heavily in Willets Point and spent time ushering it through the highly contentious review process in 2008.

Dumping of chemicals into rivers has pretty much stopped in this country, but there is a new pollution issue on the horizon.

Sewage is treated to kill bacteria and viruses, but not to take out trace medications.

ROSEMONT 7, DEL CAMPO 2
There are some safety concerns associated with a lot of succulents. Many of the species, particularly aloes, euphorbias, bromeliads and pachypodiums, are armed with spines and thorns, just as cactuses and agaves are. Euphorbias in particular have a milky sap that in some species is extremely virulent. Getting sap on the skin can cause rash and lesions, and if you get this sap in the eyes, it can ultimately cause blindness if not treated. Flush affected areas with water and see a doctor if it gets in your eyes, making sure he or she understands what is in your eye. The sap from adeniums and pachypodiums, both of which are in the same family as oleander, is generally toxic when ingested.

I don't appreciate the NFL's passer rating – and I certainly have no chance comprehending ESPN's new Total Quarterback Rating, which appears dependent on Euclidean geometry, Keynesian economics, Martha Stewart Living and Ron Jaworski's DVR – but I do understand winning. I can't tell you how many times I saw McNabb bumble around like Inspector Clouseau in cleats for three quarters or more, then find a way to drive his team to glory in the waning minutes.

By that, Hess means, this is a generation that's arriving on the scene immediately following a number of culturally seismic events. Post recession. Post Obama election. Post tsunami. Post 9/11. Post Millennial. "It will be defined more by what came before it than what comes after it," Hess says.

Put in less idealistic terms, our country is a national security state built on the vast military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about. Our government and our economy are permanently geared up for war, and very few Americans can remember a time when this was not so. It’s hard to imagine any president resisting the temptation to use this awesome force and even harder to imagine that a majority of Americans would ever elect a man who would.
Chrysler is the one company that isn't improving as U.S. auto sales rebound, Wolkonowicz said. Taking back stamping capacity now would be a bet that sales would be double what they are within a few years, and Chrysler simply can't afford to make that kind of bet right now.
“What we saw was a very quiet, reserved Gaga,” says Fusari. “I don’t know if she was intimidated. It was definitely one of her record idols. She knew the acts he had done. Jimmy talked about Mick Jagger, John Lennon and at the end of the meeting, he stood up and said, ‘Let’s give it a try.’ ”

Sure, the Cats defense ranks among the Arena Football League's top 10, having risen from second-to-last after surrendering 70 points and 386 yards in the team's season opener. However, as Hill prepared this week for Saturday's home game against the Kansas City Command (0-4), the four fourth-quarter touchdowns the SaberCats (3-2) gave up in last week's 61-55 loss to Philadelphia weighed heavily on the defensive back's mind.

Still, for a frequently silly comedy, one of the funniest and most memorable elements is unabashedly romantic: Jeff and Pat's mom, Sharon, has a secret admirer at work, and the way this enlivens her dreary, cubicle-dwelling doldrums is nothing short of magical.

Kiefer Sutherland, Mackenzie Phillips, Bobby oy! Brown, Drew Barrymore, Robin Williams, Gerard Butler, a few Osbournes, Eminem, the newly reconstructed Mickey Rourke and Robert Downey all had demons.

Even the understanding of SIDS itself has evolved. The mysterious deaths of healthy sleeping infants led to a national back-to-sleep safety campaign in 1994 -- and a 50 percent reduction in the SIDS death rate by 2000.

"The big advantage when we ride (tandem) is that we go the same speed," said Paul Kassameyer, of Livermore, who rides with his wife, Ann. The two, both 68, have taken their two-seater on European tours, and love the togetherness factor. "Even though we're the same style riders -- more cautious than daredevils -- when riding single, I'd go uphill faster, and Ann would go downhill faster. One was always waiting for the other. So (tandem) works out perfectly for us."

RADIOHEAD adds bulk to their most recent album “The King of Limbs” with the digital release of “The Daily Mail.” On this track the band shows off its skills in creating a storm to calm — dynamic with a moody and melodic acoustic piano riff, during which Thom Yorke sings the cryptic and descriptive lyrics: “The moon is a rock on a mountain/ the lunatics have taken over the asylum/ waiting on the rapture.” The song eventually slinks away from its ballad tempo and, with layers of electric instrumentation, becomes a rock anthem. By then Yorke no longer sounds at ease as he rages, “Where’s the truth, what’s the use?” It’s a powerhouse tune about a world gone wrong.

Perry drew a few chuckles when Olson tossed a question about whether she could envision changing so that she'd be able to have a relationship with men (plaintiff lawyers have been asking that question throughout the day, a clear attempt to rebut the argument of gay marriage foes that being gay is a choice, not part of their natural makeup).

Penn: He's more outgoing on set, I'm more reserved. I relied very heavily in all three movies on menthol blowers. They're this thing that makeup artists have. Basically it's like a little straw with menthol inside, and it makes your eyes get really glassy and watery. So that's the biggest thing I relied on to actually appear like you're high.

The boaters left without asking his name, and Lattanzi never found out theirs. He never mentioned the event to his father, and it might have gone unremarked, except that Kitay's sister captured a 12-second slice of the rescue on videotape.

Would Yogi Ferrell and the Park Tudor 2A champions love a shot at 4A champ Carmel? Sure they would. But I don't think they're losing a lot of sleep over it. They know they can beat 4A teams because they've beaten 4A teams, notably North Central on North Central's home court.

Remoulade is a classic French mayonnaise-based sauce that's often served with julienned vegetables. Louisiana chefs reinvented the sauce to their own, zestier standards, and the result is a reddish-hued, piquant sauce that is usually served with boiled shrimp.

Surprise! It turns out you can grow new brain cells; we used to think there were only a set number and they died off throughout life. Phooey! And getting wrapped up in almost any extracurricular group sends blood pressure down, and immunity and fun up.
Lobster roll is a regular on the menu. For $7, given the price of Maine lobster, it has to be small — and it is. Ideally, it would have a higher filling-to-bread ratio.

Such matters as ideological and geographical balance, gender, ethnicity and potential to capture a large chunk of electoral votes all get thrown into the pot.
