The only bit of acting required of Suh came in the final shot as he emerged from his car in front of his actual childhood home. The W+K crew wanted him to look every bit as menacing on camera as he might to Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers before the inevitable sack.

When a younger woman is diagnosed with breast cancer she has lengthy conversations with her doctors. She may be pondering a full mastectomy. Another set of conversations and doctor's visits will arise if a woman needs chemotherapy but plans to have more children. She'll need to consider freezing her eggs because chemotherapy could leave her infertile.

Rep. Chris Garrett, a Lake Oswego Democrat, proposed a 10 percent tax on birdseed sales in 2009. That died. This year, bird lovers are asking for a nickel fee on each pound sold. The measure, sponsored by the House Revenue Committee, would sunset in 2020. Seed is most commonly sold in 20-pound bags, so that would amount to a buck a bag.
The measure was designed as a compromise after aldermen last year narrowly defeated a proposed ban on the sale of dogs and cats at pet stores. Both are aimed at limiting the availability of animals supplied by so-called puppy mills.
Her brother, Josh, played junior league hockey in Chicago with the man who would become her husband. But back then George, a New Jersey native, was just her kid brother's friend visiting in Wisconsin. Tiffany left home in 1999 to travel in Europe.

We sympathize (slightly) when Mr. Oberlton, a relative newcomer to the system, observes that his pre-renovation basement office repelled visitors, including job applicants. Some level of upgrade was likely justified. But wood floors, a glass-encased conference room, interactive white boards, a vaulted ceiling and entirely new heating and air conditioning system?
In 1994, Shriver received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, from President Bill Clinton.
"This has helped out so many people I know," another woman says. Her name is Nancy Jo Nelson, and she climbed aboard one day in Sandy. She worked for Bank of America for nine years, she says, then her husband "got real sick, it just snowballed from there." Her story is of so much loss. Her husband. A house she had to give up years ago, but which she can only now bring herself to look at, but still, not without crying. Her dignity -- "For a long time I was so ashamed," she says.

Finally, the argument that Big Labor in Ohio is tapped out after spending $40 million in the last election is simply wishful thinking. A ton of the money spent to beat Issue 2 came from outside of Ohio, and there's plenty more where that came from. As long as people are forced to join unions, the supply of money Big Labor can throw at its political emergencies is, for all intents and purposes, inexhaustible.
Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Marianne Wolk expects China's Internet ad market to grow from about $3 billion last year to as much as $20 billion in 2014. Google appeared to be well positioned to pick up about $5 billion to $6 billion of that projected 2014 revenue, Wolk said, because its Chinese search engine has a roughly one-third share -- a distant second to the homegrown Baidu Inc.

"His contribution … to the nation, and indeed the world, is difficult to quantify because it is so wide-ranging," ANU Vice Chancellor Ian Chubb said in a statement. Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, who won the 1996 prize in medicine, has often said Fenner should have received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work eradicating smallpox "because they sometimes give the peace prize for enormous practical achievements."
There may be no female protagonist in literature as tragic as Lily Bart—and, yes, I include Anna Karenina when I say that. Beautiful, intelligent, "horribly poor—and very expensive," she knows what the upper echelons of 19th-century New York society demand of her: an advantageous marriage, a bargain in which she will provide the gilding and her husband the gold. And yet she twists in the net, resenting the bargain, knowing how to calculate what she needs to do but not calculating enough to seal the deal. ("For always getting what she wants in the long run, commend me to a nasty woman," says a friend who knows Lily is never nasty.) She dismisses the man she loves because he has no fortune, dismisses the man with the fortune because choosing him would compromise her principles, and finds herself finally with neither, nothing. Undone by envy, gossip and her own credulity, she slides down the mahogany banister of position and respectability. Wharton's first novel is like science fiction in reverse, a horrifying look back to an almost other-worldly time, in which a heroine of insight and sensitivity can cry, "What a miserable thing it is to be a woman."

They see that the historical stalwarts of employment won't take care of you.
"Yeah, it's a big adjustment," West said. "I knew I was going to have to sacrifice that part of my game in terms of offensively and how aggressive I was with the ball. My ego wasn't an issue.

When we attended the annual Feast of Lanterns Festival in Pacific Grove, I did not imagine that 65 years ago squid boats lit at night were used to attract the mollusks, a harvest no one desired until the Chinese created a market for them. After 1906, the year someone set fire to the Point Alones Chinatown, where the Monterey Bay Aquarium now stands, Pacific Grove residents grew nostalgic for the lights, like fairy lanterns on the water, and so a magic tale was born to glimmer.

My first reaction when a copy of Paul Dickson's new biography, "Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick," lands in my lap is to be curious if justice has been done to him, before turning a single page. I touch base with Mike Veeck, the great man's son (a man of a few radical and wonderfully ridiculous notions of his own), to inquire if the descendants approve.

Ultimately, the Garden - with its sustainable wine list, larger a la carte plates, and expansive cheese bar - needs to craft its own identity. But three head chefs into the adventure, I think Olexy has found a promising kitchen steward in Sean McPaul. A return visit in December produced a meal that was inspired by pristine ingredients first, not clever techniques, though most were rendered with elegant precision and focus: tortelloni stuffed with braised oxtail; duck with chestnuts in Madeira sauce; rustic leg of lamb with squash and olives; and tender gnocchi tossed with oozing Quadrello buffalo's milk cheese and charred Brussels sprouts.

Cho and Penn retain an easygoing chemistry, so, of course, we hope they patch things up. It's fun to see Harris send up his image again. It's always nice to see Thomas Lennon, who plays Harold's obsequious friend (and father of the toddler). And there are a couple of funny nods to the wholly unnecessary 3-D in which the film is shot.

That will arouse uneasy feelings that technology has once again done away with something we assumed was eternal -- the phone books that arrived once a year, the ones we sat on as kids at the dinner table, are shrinking as fewer and fewer people bother to be listed in them. Those of us who remember looking ourselves up in the white pages and thinking that now we belong to a place may lament -- not for the first time -- that our real-world communities are becoming more fragmented as people spend time in online communities of their own choosing instead.

Yes, we're told, the administration is courting potential successors and, yes, we're moving forward. But we'd rather not talk about it. There's even an indication that one suitor is talking about running the race as a non-profit enterprise, a non-polluting Green Grand Prix. What utter nonsense. The apparent deadline to begin organizing a new race is March. I hope it passes without having been met relieving the taxpayers of another burden about which they weren't even consulted.

"I don't think it's OK to entice children with Happy Meals with the promise of a toy," Parham said, adding that she tries to hold her daughters, 6 and 2, to monthly visits to the fast-food chain. But she said their requests increased this summer, thanks to the popularity of "Shrek Forever After."

Abruptly, at least I felt it that way, our friendship ended. She would no longer stay in touch, and worse, she would not tell me what had happened. The chance to tell her that it doesn't matter to me what happened and if I did something I am so sorry is something I want to tell her.
"(Our players) have been working and preparing since August for the chance to represent our program and the university, and I believe that we've got a quality group that will compete day in and day out," he said.

I was putting it piles of thousands, and then moving it over to a $5,000 stack. It's better to put $5,000 together the best you can. I was mad about the money and I was mad about Adam Heikkila. I'm pretty sure I was cursing him out. I say, 'This is it, this is the last -- I'm (expletive) done with you, this is the last deal we're going to do.'" I looked up and he was pointing the gun and he said, 'Give me the (expletive) money.' I put my hands up; I grabbed the gun, it went off. He reached around the seat for the gun. I just started pulling the trigger -- I just started pulling the trigger."

Haridopolos, the flip side. Here's the good news on our Brevard County legislator: He's one of the few leaders standing tall when it comes to pill mills. While Gov. Rick Scott wants to get rid of a database for heavy users of prescription drugs — something that has broad bipartisan support from politicians and law enforcement — Haridopolos is standing firm. "We have no interest whatsoever of scrapping that database," he said in a recent story by the News Service of Florida. "I strongly believe that we have to get a handle on this." Haridopolos is right. That doctors in Florida prescribe more oxycodone than doctors in the other 49 states combined is appalling. So, good for Haridopolos for having such backbone. Heck, more backbone and fewer book deals, Senator, and this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

“The Gin Game” drops deep knowledge and light humor into a seemingly simple card game, pouring some hard-won life wisdom into an ordinary, if slightly depressing, setting and that spoonful of sugar is what helps the lesson go down and makes the play truly brilliant.

That night, I Bixied back to the Plateau for dinner at La Banquise, Montreal's best known shop for poutine. This local specialty — French fries topped with gravy and cheese curds — is hearty, delicious and awesome with beer, though try as I might, all my photos made it look like dog food. None of the hipsters around me seemed to mind, with lines out the door, particularly after 3 a.m., when bars close. La Banquise tops the standard poutine dozens of ways, most pretty meaty. I chose Galvaude, with peas and shredded turkey, and was stuffed two-thirds of the way through.

A During my student years I had opportunities to study and work with a lot of great people. Gary Burton was one, and was a remarkable teacher for the incredible variety of approaches and ways of thinking about improvisation that he brought to the table. He had an exceptionally open ear and mind, and found ideas and inspiration in all kinds of music. Another major influence was my composition teacher at UC Berkeley, Andrew Imbrie, one of the master composers of his generation.

Q. Since the Yankees played a 2:15 game against the Tigers, can they roll over the unused minutes when they play the Red Sox? — John Serapilio, Clifton Park, N.Y.
I believe the Rangers might get a slight edge because they were in this same place last year and figure to be especially motivated to do more than make an appearance. On the other hand, the Cardinals have veterans like Berkman and Furcal who have come close but never lit a cigar. I believe the Cardinals get a slight edge in the dugout, in that Tony La Russa is a more aggressive manager than Ron Washington. In my mind, aggressive is good in a seven-game block.

Kendrea* Age: 30 Town: Kansas City Job: Kansas City Chiefs cheerleader Best date: "I went out with this guy and a group of his friends. We just went to different bars in town. ... It was just fun hanging out with people I hadn't met before, and this guy at the time, I really liked him." Worst date: "It was a DJ. I called and requested a song, and he turned out to be this really cool guy. We talked on the phone for a long time, so I agreed to come to his studio and meet him. ... It was uncomfortable for everybody that was there. I was like, why did I do this? He wasn't the person I met on the phone. He acted like he had to prove something to me." What she's looking for: A tall, funny, athletic, attractive, spontaneous guy who will dance with her and knows what he wants and goes after it. What friends say: "Guys see that she's a Chiefs cheerleader, so they have this assumption she's going to be ditsy. Then they see she went to law school, so she'll be intelligent and quiet. Then she starts getting all crazy and goofy. ... I think guys are just like, whoa, I have three different girlfriends at one time." -Tonya Ware Last words: "I hate those games where he has to wait three days to call me. If you like me, let me know, so I don't have to sit there and figure it out. ... When I first go out with a guy, if he doesn't already know I'm a cheerleader, I don't let him know until I feel there's a connection. ... Sometimes I feel like, if I like this guy, I'm going to have to be the one to call him. I like guys who take initiative." * The Chiefs don't release the last names of their cheerleaders.

The committee said a number of statements News International executives made in 2009 were untrue, including the claim that illegal voice-mail interception was limited to one reporter and the assertion that phone hacking had been investigated thoroughly by the company.

They must think Americans are suffering from amnesia and cannot recall President George W. Bush and his "Top Gun" moment in 2003. Just in case anyone really has forgotten, allow me to recap: Bush tucked himself into a flight suit emblazoned with the words "commander-in-chief," climbed into a Lockheed S-3 Viking fixed-wing aircraft and helped fly and land it on the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier, the Abraham Lincoln, just off the California coast. There, under a huge banner declaring "Mission Accomplished" (a banner White House officials initially denied, but finally admitted, was their creation), the president said, "In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed."

The 5 Factors for Orlando's mighty March this season:
Camby, 37, was acquired by the Blazers just before the 2010 trade deadline and has started at center for the team since. He averaged 4.7 points and 10.3 rebounds during 59 games last season. The 15-year NBA veteran and one-time defensive player of the year is entering the final season of a two-year contract with the Blazers.
All of these players are expected to be back for the summer. While most are fully confident Greene will back to 100% come August, he was such a tremendous impact player for the defense that there will always be some concern. The only player I worry about is Jefferson. Now entering his fifth and final season, Jefferson was beginning to come along last year. Hopefully an idle offseason won’t cause any conditioning issues as he will need to hit the field running to gain the trust of the new staff. It would have been great to have Johnson get the additional practice, especially with the move to LT (to be discussed later). However, with the talent and athleticism that allowed him to rise up the depth charts he should be able to easily catch up.
Andre Brown was in North Carolina. He had just been in Indianapolis. And before that, Denver.
His return to the front office last year and set off a whirlwind of activity that landed the Broncos in the playoffs. But Elway is in this to win Super Bowls and he's throwing his hat in with Manning, the 50,000-yard passer who redefined the quarterback position through the 2000s, not Tebow -- who seems most comfortable carrying and not throwing the ball.

It's fun to encounter a place on the way up, before it draws the crowd it deserves, when you can still walk in, as of this writing, and grab any table you want. This is the case with Hokkaido, which is right next to the delicious and exotic Ethiopian restaurant Queen Sheba, just a short stroll from the Tower Theatre and, with its wide- ranging menu and French toast to die for, perennial favorite Tower Cafe.
I don't know if I completely buy that story. But I've always liked it. That is why I suppose it's reasonable to consider "Trombone Shorty" a Joshua in reverse; a musical crusader who uses his trombone to restore the city walls that Katrina sought to destroy.

øHe signed with William Morris Agency and after appearing in small roles on multiple television shows, he landed the part of Goober Pyle on The Andy Griffith Show in 1964 - about two years after he first tried out for the role of Gomer Pyle, which was awarded to Jim Nabors.

The earlier letter authored by Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles and signed by the rest of Ohio's House of Representatives Democrats contended that the state was using tax dollars to "advance a privatization plan that could potentially severely cost drivers via increased tolls, threaten the job security of over 1,000 Ohioans, and drive up the costs for local governments through increased maintenance costs of local roads."

But in fairness, Martz didn't have the weapons needed to run his scheme, starting with major problems on the offensive line that were arguably never resolved. The offensive line certainly lacked continuity until the bye week. Not coincidentally Tice and Martz had a heart-to-heart at that stage and came to an understanding that they couldn't block up the wide-open, pass-happy system that is the coordinator's calling card. So the maverick coordinator reeled in his flamboyant tendencies and ran the most balanced offense in the league in terms of run and pass plays, keying a five-game winning streak as part of a 7-2 close to the season.
"He’s able to do this as often as he wants," Wollmer said. "Unfortunately, he doesn’t have to pay to get his message out. This governor has woven a tapestry of lies for the last two years and the only way we could legitimately set the record straight is to pay to get our message out."

But others believe technological innovations have a way to go before carbon-neutral luxury becomes standard. Charles McDowell, an estate agent in central London, points out that few top interior design firms are fully briefed on sustainability codes set by LEED (an internationally recognized green building certification system) or BREEAM (a voluntary measurement rating for green buildings established in the U.K.) Alex Michelin, director of Finchatton, a high-end interior design and development company, says: "The products out there are still far behind the labeling requirements set out under LEED and BREEAM. The whole supply chain—handles, fabrics, timber suppliers, electronics—all need to sign up to these codes before designers will have the information required to make informed decisions."
At Tuality Community Hospital in Hillsboro, the first 2009 baby was born at 11:56 a.m. to the Potta family. The girl, who did not have a name yet, weighed 6 pounds, 7 ounces, said Brian Costa, a Tuality spokesman.
Nopales, the cactus, is unquestionably healthful, a source of vitamin C and potassium and bioflavonoids. Tortillas made with nopales taste basically like tortillas, although when it is time for a second round of tortillas, you may well opt for the regular ones, which are somewhat less puddingy inside. Cactus may well cure every disease you throw at it, as well as conquering childhood obesity and providing valuable manganese, but you are not going to change your lifestyle in one night.

Although metal cocktail shakers that include a built-in strainer look pretty spiffy, I far prefer to use a Boston shaker. The Boston shaker is made up of two flat-bottomed cones, one metal, one glass. There's something about this piece of equipment that makes me think that anyone who can use it properly means business.

"It really changed the way an airport functions and the way people feel about a trip to the airport. You'd wait by the gate and watched the plane come in. You can't do that anymore. … Airline travel is much more of a business experience as opposed to a social event," said Swaim-Staley, who later became Maryland transportation chief.

Second, he cited the My Lai massacre as an example of our military’s terrorism. He could have cited the recent murder of 17 Afghan civilians. Those were horrible crimes, but they were aberrations. It makes as much sense to call our military “terrorist” because of the crimes of a few as it does to call all Clevelanders “criminals” because of the 11 murders for which Anthony Sowell has been charged. That’s guilt by association.
It was a 1918 Lafite that a customer brought. It took 35 minutes to open - I wanted to open it just perfectly - and the customer was getting antsy.

The Volcano Boat Tours operate daily, from early July through mid-September.

A witness to Surf City’s ordeal, Harvey Cedars took a different approach. It wanted a contiguous dune line, the only way it would be effective against a storm surge. What easements the borough couldn’t get through negotiations, it obtained through condemnation. Municipal officials offered oceanfront homeowners what they considered fair market value for the strips of sand: $300 apiece. Objecting to what they felt was not just compensation, homeowners went to court. This time they didn’t sue over loss of privacy but rather over what they said was the lost value of their property because the new dunes blocked their ocean views — the most valuable asset of their homes.

Furthermore, the U.S. State Department considers Iran to be "the most active state sponsor of terrorism."

Presidential administrations came and went. Cassette tapes gave way to iPods.

Nearly four years ago, NPI, at the invitation of the Cleveland Foundation, decided to initiate a pilot deconstruction project. The appeal was environmental and economic. A two-person crew working about a day and a half can demolish a single-family house. A crew of four to six, working about a week, can deconstruct a similar property. Additional jobs could be created through businesses like furniture-making, selling the salvageables or recycling materials like shingles into new products. Since 2008, the nonprofit has overseen the deconstruction of 45 properties.

2) Yucatán (1.3): The land of the Maya is arguably Mexico's most beguiling state, and its safety is icing on the cake. (Drug-related deaths doubled in 2010 — from 1 to 2.) Despite being overshadowed by Cancún and the Riviera Maya in neighboring Quintana Roo, the Yucatán has a well-developed tourist infrastructure, thousands of archaeological sites, refreshing cenotes, grand haciendas, uncrowded beaches, stunning wildlife, widely varied ecotourism and unfailingly gracious people. You could visit every year for the rest of your life and never run out of things to do and see. If you're still wary of going to Mexico, think of Yucatán as a country apart — many of its residents do.
The courts have been a factor. The Supreme Court ruled in January 2010 that corporations and unions could spend money directly on campaigns. That sparked the rise of "super PACs" — which are allowed to raise unlimited sums — and the GOP promptly launched an aggressive campaign for the midterm election. The ruling was a game-changer that will result in hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on behalf of political campaigns next year.
For the longest time, the Celtics struggled to do anything right.

The Dardennes' deceptively simple approach to storytelling, their documentary-like sense of place, and the incredible work they get from their actors are things to admire. But it's the powerful emotional punch their films deliver - and this one is no exception - that elevate the game, that make them so satisfying, so worthwhile. The Kid With a Bike grabs at the heart.

Merkel and Sarkozy also said they did not want to increase the size of the EU's 440 billion euro rescue fund, which may have to take over a massive, multibillion euro European Central Bank program to support the prices of Spanish and Italian bonds by buying them up on the open market.

So we have: The Pope, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, Monsignors and priests, all men, telling women they can't use birth control medicine. Now! God the Father has the right to decide our fate, but why did he choose an all "bachelor" staff to officiate a woman's destiny? God must have "Inspired" these men with great second hand wisdom because most bachelors are pretty naive when it comes to women.
His casual tone and innate sense of optimism made it feel like everything would be fine. In fact, the Beastie Boys' label, EMI, followed it up with an announcement that assured fans that the cancer was localized and treatable with immediate surgery. Yauch's vocal cords would not be affected. He was expected to make a full recovery.
Santana’s delay between wins had lasted one year, seven months and 27 days. On Sept. 2, 2010, he hurried off the Turner Field mound with a foreign sensation in his left shoulder — but a major-league victory in his pocket, the 133rd of his career. He will have to keep waiting for No. 134.

The Predators have their sights set on building on what they accomplished last season, when they won the first playoff series in franchise history. That was a cause of celebration in Nashville, because they had to start somewhere.

Capobianco’s pitch-perfect direction provided the animating soul of the evening. The dramatic action flowed smoothly back and forth across the stage, with winking references to song-and-dance numbers from golden-age Hollywood — a bit with Miersma and his fellow nobles, complete with canes and kicks, was a highlight of the staging, ironically funny but fully within the spirit of the piece. Seldom does a two-hour operetta fly by as fleet and light-hearted as this.

A four-hour drive from Philadelphia brought me to the main street of Woodstock. Immaculately clean with its charming town hall, picturesque art galleries, stores, and restaurants - it could easily be mistaken for a movie set.

Reusing opened Bad Decisions in Fells Point four years ago. Woodberry Kitchen opened around the same time, and Mr. Rain's Fun House at the American Visionary Art Museum opened a year after. Though Dorr has been a professional bartender for nearly a decade, he's been at B&O since 2009.

Makenzie wasn't gay, but Max is. What the Janssens would later learn is that gender identity and sexual orientation are separate, and sometimes complicated issues.
Now consider life with our children. We never get the ones we so looked forward to, either. Those perfect little always-delightful things who respond to us sweetly and love us perfectly into our old age. We get the children who present challenges, and difficulties, and outright sin to be dealt with in ways we never thought possible, but who give us joy and enrich us in ways we never conceived of, either. Not least of all because suddenly it's not "all about me" anymore.

It wasn't until 2007, two years into the project, that he began to understand that he was going to need a personal lens. The catalyst was the suicide of his grandfather, Eugene Seelye, who had lived for 80 of his 83 years on the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota (where Treuer was also born and raised). "My grandfather's death was tragic," he says, "but his life was not tragic. I didn't want him to be defined in terms of his last fraction of a second when there was so much more." As an example, Treuer notes that Seelye lived in the only place that mattered to him, surrounded by the only people who mattered to him, a bounty that eludes many more overtly privileged lives.

I have planted ice plant, portaluca, aloes, snapdragons, some small cactuses and other succulents. Nothing but the aloes are thriving. The snapdragons and vinca flower anemically during the winter and wilt during the summer. The cactuses get etiolated in the winter and sunburned in the summer. Is there anything other than aloes that will thrive in winter shade and summer sun?

Make that ex-agent, since he discovered some double-crossing in a CIA-like operation — but instead of getting a promotion he ended up doing jail time for murder. "Lockout" opens as agency investigators are trying to beat him into revealing where to find a briefcase that holds some state secrets. But it only serves to bloody his face, strengthen his resolve and sharpen his comic timing.
In addition to classroom activities, she had art and gym, library time and computer time. She learned to use the Internet and do simple word processing.

Still, as comfortable as she is with her body, Farmiga’s quite aware that sexism and double standards apply in the industry.

The shuttle is still the envy of space-faring nations around the world. But as former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has observed, the shuttle was also "an inherently flawed vehicle." Its design was constrained by budget limitations and by Air Force insistence that it accommodate the largest of spy satellites and the mission profiles to support them. It was only partially reusable, jettisoning its main fuel tank and rocket boosters on its way to orbit. The wear and tear of flying in and out of the atmosphere drove refurbishing costs to budget-busting levels.

Your 17-year-old boy is not only still a minor, but also does not have the financial and institutional standing to support himself. Instead, he lives at home, becoming an adult incrementally on his parents' dime. It makes no sense for parents to absorb the money and decision-making burdens of adulthood while just handing their kids the perks. If Junior wants to play house, then he can rent house. If he doesn't like the back seat, then he can be abstinent.
