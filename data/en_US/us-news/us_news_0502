"I have a great sense or accomplishment,'' said Parker, who has dedicated his life to the idea that art museums enrich people's lives, whatever their background. "The decline of organized religion and the advances of materialism and secularism have led people to require some stimulation in their lives that's more than just a TV set. Something spiritual. Provocative. A museum is the perfect vehicle for somebody to absorb information and experience in an intuitive way, rather than have it beat it into them. You move in different directions and you see something that triggers you. To be a museumgoer is to follow your nose, to perceive things, to challenge assumptions. It changes your whole way of seeing the world.''

Comedy. * * PG-13. Comedian and radio host Steve Harvey wrote a best seller titled "Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment." This was advice for women. It apparently left some questions, because in 2010 Harvey felt the demand for another book, "Straight Talk, No Chaser: How to Find, Keep and Understand a Man."

The twist comes when the men in their lives discover their secret reading and study the book themselves. Now the men know the women's game plan.

It's true that U.S. and Western officials see the prospect of Egyptian democracy as exhilarating in theory, but risky in reality. Mubarak was a despot who honored his predecessor's treaty with Israel and was a friendly anchor in an often hostile, unstable region.

Longstanding ties between top Egyptian and U.S. military leaders could be a huge boon, too.

And while acupuncture can sometimes affect parts of the body far away from the needle site, Glickman-Simon says the claim that acupuncture in the hand can treat every part of the body has no basis in either traditional Chinese medicine or modern science.

The rollicking first single "Good Girl," whose dirty power chords would not have sounded out of place on an album-rock radio station in the early '80s, topped the iTunes country songs chart in less than nine hours to become her fastest-selling single yet. The singer promised a "darker storyline" than usual in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. The album was produced by Underwood's longtime collaborator Mark Bright.

Still, while the public imagines a universe of star cruisers and galactic cyberwebs, budget-cutting bureaucrats find even partial grants for SETI an easy target.

But not everyone loves that feeling. Lynnette Cashman, a retired accountant from West Chester, says she felt "a little out of sync" during a 30th-anniversary surprise planned by her husband, who normally leaves travel arrangements to her.

To be fair, it wasn't just the attitudes and experience of my dining companions that made the two visits different. At Bern's, your server can make or break an evening. With years of grueling training behind them, they can come off as knowledgeable and gracious or, sadly, supercilious and braggy. We had one of each. On our first visit, our server ran through all the Bern's hyperbole ("organic produce from our own garden," "largest restaurant wine list in the country," "in-house dry aging"), but never once asked if we were enjoying ourselves or if we needed anything. The second time, the waiter anticipated our needs, explained without condescending, cracked wise and generally charmed us.

When utilized properly, medical imaging offers high diagnostic accuracy with acceptable levels of radiation risk.

The revelation of identity, the call itself, can never be the most important part of the story. It properly belongs near the beginning, and is the catalyst for everything that follows. Harry needs to go out into the world and learn to become the person he now knows he was created to be. He has to build up his knowledge and his skills, develop friendships, experience challenges and losses and great joys that are all a part of the journey. Jonah has to go to Nineveh for his call to be fulfilled. Moses has to confront the Pharaoh and lead his people through the desert. The disciples have to cast away their nets and follow Jesus. We all have to do the same thing. It is how we respond to the call, how we let it shape our actions and our understanding, that is so critical.

Lake is an atheist who says he has neither Satan to blame for his cancer or God to call on for help. He is humbled and gratified by the support from family and friends and strangers. Strangers send him heartfelt letters. They help pitch in to send him to science fiction and fantasy conventions, the "cons" that are the joyous heart of the genre. Science fiction and fantasy movies dominate popular culture -- 18 of the 20 most popular movies of all time are either animated or fantasy-based, based on U.S. domestic gross -- but the writing community is much smaller. Lake estimates there are about 1,500 people -- agents, editors and writers -- actively working professionally in the field. When "one of the cool kids," as Scholes calls Lake, gets colon cancer, they all know it.

Christians who wanted to preserve slavery had the words of the Bible to back them up.

All decisions are made for you, and just like at home, you have no say. Set menu, set price, no choices, no substitutions. Vegetarian? Good luck. Dieting? Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

In yet another dish, the delicate pappardelle resemble strips of chiffon, studded with morels, peas and a feathering of pea shoots. The butter sauce that glazes everything is again enhanced with dried porcini, setting up the startling contrast of the fresh, sweet produce and the deep, earthy mushrooms.

"It's a formidable challenge to build under a building," says Rodney Gibble, a Manhattan-based structural engineer who says he's working on a growing number of basement expansions with swimming pools, gyms and small basketball courts. He says construction costs in New York below ground can be 50% to 100% more than the $800 to $1,000 per square foot cost of a high-end aboveground town house gut renovation.
Experts believe the downward trend is tied to the economy, which officially was in a recession from December 2007 until June 2009 and remains weak. The theory is that women with money worries -- especially younger women -- feel they can't afford to start a family or add to it.

(Springsteen released it on "The Promise," his 2010 collection of "Darkness on the Edge of Town" outtakes.) Band plays it as though it's an E Street Staple. Another highlight — there have been a lot so far. Holds up a sign saying "Talk to Me" so I guess this was a crowd request. I didn't realize that at first. A little bit of a "Shout"-like raveup at the end.
Yet to come: In 2014, Oregon and other states expect to open health insurance exchanges intended to create a more affordable market for people to buy health insurance. Individuals earning less than about $43,000 (or less than $88,000 for a family of four) will be eligible for subsidies. Insurers no longer will be able to charge more because of illness or deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition. States must extend Medicaid coverage to all adults earning less than about $14,400 a year (133 percent of the federal poverty level). Federal funds will cover all the costs of newly eligible individuals through 2016 and a large portion thereafter.

Wayne Pacelle, the national society president, said his group agreed to drop its quest in exchange for other legislative fixes. One big issue - still working its way through the statehouse - is the so-called 'shelter tax."
