As heroines go, Mia is a hard case, and Ms. Arnold declines to make her a softer one. We come to like her only by fits and starts, come to see her vulnerability very slowly. The one time the story flirts with sentimentality is when Mia is smitten by the spectacle of a white horse chained to a cement block in a junk-strewn lot.

ø•Will Wes Welker be back with the New England Patriots? It probably will come down to money. Welker's late drop in the Super Bowl was a costly, uncharacteristic mistake he said he would spend the offseason living with. Tom Brady said he loves Welker. But with Brady 0-2 in his last two Super Bowls and 6-6 in his last 12 postseason games with 17 interceptions, the Patriots sorely need an infusion of big-play receiver speed. How high will owner Robert Kraft be willing to go for Welker?

Etsuko Price, who has become an active partner in the collection, points out details in the paintings that might by missed by Western observers. The life-size bull in a pair of nearly 12-foot-wide screens is more than a drop-dead amazing image of a beast, she says.

I called CASA, left a message for Atteberry and then e-mailed Israelson to ask why he wanted to contact Atteberry. He would only say he wanted to apologize. Weeks later, Atteberry returned my call.

Drivers today are similarly attached to their cell phones and in-car technology. But unlike the drivers of the 1930s, they're conflicted over efforts to regulate them. While a survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found 94% of drivers consider texting while driving "a serious threat" and 87% favor texting bans, more than a third admitted reading a text or e-mail while driving in the past month. Nearly 70% of drivers reported talking on their cell phone while they were driving.
Or an old Keaton movie. You feel this way because a Greta Gerwig performance is as naturalistic and free of style as her everyday conversation, and as sprightly and fun to listen to as her name, Greta Gerwig. She is verbose, funny, prone to long, meandering thoughts that end in a self-conscious laugh, a dismissal of everything she has just said. And no — aside from starring in the new indie comedy"Damsels in Distress,"the first movie from director Whit Stillman in 14 years — she doesn't fit that cleanly into anything.

If the goal is to buttress the stability of Social Security decades from now, raising the retirement is not the solution. Raising the retirement age guarantees cuts in benefits for all retirees.

Known primarily for their late-career glam-rock reinvention and the David Bowie-written smash hit "All the Young Dudes," England's Mott the Hoople started as protégés of legendary producer Guy Stevens, evolving into one of the world's best, hardest-rocking live acts in the early 1970s, led by super-cool front man Ian Hunter. Chris Hill and Mike Kerry's thrilling, bittersweet documentary, made with full participation of ex-members, gives the full lowdown on this perpetually underrated group and captures the zeitgeist of Mott's brief but action-packed life span. Now this was a rock'n'roll band.

A self-described modern-day Tarzan, Mootnick founded the nonprofit Gibbon Conservation Center in Santa Clarita in 1976.

My favorite thing about watching Suggs, however, might be the opportunities he creates for others. He's extremely good at locking up a tight end or a tackle, stringing a play out wide, and forcing a ball carrier to abandon his initial cut. Those plays don't show up in the stats, but that's one of the reasons the Ravens are so good at stopping the run. The string plays out to the sideline, and the guys on the edges who responsible for keeping contain rarely get suckered up the field (and have a runner slip underneath them, and they rarely get hook blocked. Suggs does this as well as anyone in football. And he still rushes the passer incredibly well.

Schiano: Joe was, has been a ton, everything to me. He gave me a chance. I was a 25-year-old kid, and he gave me a chance, hired me as a full-time coach at one of the top programs in the country. He certainly gave my career a jumpstart to say the least, and I learned a ton working under him for six years and he's been a mentor of mine. He and Sue and the whole Paterno family have been great to Christy, myself and our family. I know eventually it's going to happen. It's just very, very hard under these circumstances. A lot of hard things. And as I said Monday, I don't think you need a whole lot of people talking about everything that's going on out there. I know it's a very keen subject right now, but I just feel better staying on our (game). I'll be rooting for coach Paterno. Hopefully he has a great end to these next couple of weeks. I don't know if he has two games left and then a bowl — or three games. The whole thing is sad.

But the more challenging maze for Whicher consisted in the emotional relations among the Kent family members. Summerscale slowly unfolds her story with the skill of an Agatha Christie or a P.D. James (and in the author's acknowledgments, James is thanked for her help). Despite its intense privacy, the Kent family revealed itself, under Whicher's investigation, to be profoundly unhappy. The great source of tension was Samuel Kent's remarriage, after his first wife's death, to the family governess, Mary Pratt. The children of the second marriage were favored over the children of the first, and Whicher turned his "air of keen observation" on Constance, one of Kent's older daughters, for two very slight reasons: her reportedly cool demeanor right after the murder and a missing nightdress.

Last year, when SLUH watched all that talent graduate, the Junior Billikens were once again good but not great by their standards. SLUH took fourth at the 2010 tournament as DeSmet won the state title. Most programs would be happy if not overjoyed by a fourth-place finish. It was a bitter pill for the juniors and seniors on that team to swallow. They were devastated they hadn't lived up to the tradition. That they had, in some way, let the program down by not winning the championship.

AWe love being a mutual company. It's a great business model because the people who own our policies also own the company.

I settled into a middle seat in the last row of economy class. It was a reminder that the entitlements of the last few weeks were never meant to be permanent.

Nine of the Grapefruit League parks are clustered on or near the state’s west coast, from Dunedin (Toronto Blue Jays), in the Tampa Bay area, south 150 miles or so to Fort Myers. The Minnesota Twins play there at Hammond Stadium, and the Boston Red Sox are this spring debuting a $78 million, 10,000-seat park whose confines are supposed to resemble Fenway Park, complete with a Green Monster left field wall.

The lines and curves of Yanagi's designs were as distinctly Japanese as they were universal, winning him fans — and a place in homes not only in Japan but around the world — for his teapots, ceramic cups and even the lowly whisk, which became artwork with his touch.
The cafe plans to open in the basement of 322 S.E. 82nd Ave. in Portland's Montavilla neighborhood at 4:20 p.m. The time is a cheeky reference to marijuana culture; some think it derived from old police slang, and others trace it to the time a group of young people would meet to smoke in the 1970s.
In other action, the design-review officials approved installing 4,500-square-feet of solar panels on Adelbert Gym, near the wind turbine site.
Young women, for instance, were the subjects in the famous (to us, anyway) "beer goggles" study. It found that the more young women drink, the worse they are at detecting facial symmetry. Facial symmetry, of course, is a predictor of beauty. Thus, the more a young woman drinks, the less likely she is to detect that her date's face could stop a truck.
The six schools, which enroll about 3,800 students, fared worse on standardized tests this year than nearly all traditional and charter schools in St. Louis.

He said James was a model prisoner.
Another GOP mega donor who contributed to the Romney super PAC in January was Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons, who gave $8.6 million to Republican super PACs last year. He directed $100,000 to Restore Our Future three days after Romney won the New Hampshire primary. But his loyalties appear divided: On Jan. 24, three days after Gingrich's surprise win in South Carolina, he donated another $500,000 to the pro-Gingrich super PAC. Simmons also gave $5 million last month to American Crossroads, a Republican group formed in part by Karl Rove, building upon the $7 million he and his company donated to the super PAC in 2011.
It's fun to watch toddlers on a carousel. They're full of delight and sometimes a little fright. In a way, merry-go-rounds are gateways to thrill rides. To a kid, there's the distinct possibility that they could be flung from the mechanical horse, sent sailing counterclockwise.

Knapp couldn't attend the meeting because he was out of town. Another councilor, Steve Hurst, reminded the mayor of the narrow focus of the night's meeting: to discuss expansion alternatives. "I think the most important word to keep in mind is 'balance,'" said Hurst, who also represents the city on the airport planning advisory committee. "Balance is what's going to get us through this."
Even Sen. Larry George, R-Sherwood, who voted no, praised the concept. He said he voted no to register his concern that the governor's new mega-education board, which will control the compacts, might use them to quash local innovation rather than foster it, as proponents claim.

"It was just guy stuff," Quinn said. "We talked football. We talked about life. We talked about the tumor. I told him he was going to make it through. I told him the doctor told me I was supposed to be brain dead, so I'm living testimony that it can happen. I didn't want to go in there and tell him something negative no matter how serious his condition was. I wanted to give him hope. I had to give him hope, because at times like that, that's all you have to cling to."
"I've seen it. I've read it I think it's a very strong proposal that meets the requirements of the lease, which are to bring the components of the stadium that are listed in the lease up to top tier," Slay said. "We're just waiting to hear back from the Rams."

PRESCOTT - Republican voters in this northern Arizona city were guaranteed a raucous congressional campaign in their district this year, with three conservative heavy-hitters pitted against one another in the Aug. 28 primary.
He imagines a world where people are born with glowing clocks on their arms that start counting down to zero at age 25. Adding time to your arm-counter prolongs your life; if it runs out, your heart stops. The problem is that time also happens to be the global currency -- you're paid in units of time, you buy things with units of time. (A cup of coffee, for example, costs 4 minutes.)
Mozeliak said work is under way to find a new manager for the first time since La Russa was hired prior to the 1996 season. A search committee will be formed. Mozeliak did not speculate on how long the process might take.

Then they buckled under the weight of the pressure to win without Rose in an embarrassing 109-92 loss to the 76ers. Then they made Rose feel even worse than he looked ambling alone into a suite to watch his team look so lost without him. Then they fell deeper into a funk that confirmed Chicagoans’ worst fears by forgetting how to play defense in allowing the Sixers to shoot 59 percent.
"When we came back we were incredibly inspired and ready to change the world," Loomis says, laughing a little at herself. "We realized we love to cook, and we want to inspire other people. We thought about doing a cafe, but then we realized there's not a lot of farm-fresh food on-the-go."
Under the bill, the Kansas City plan could be used in other parts of the state where districts became unaccredited, except in St. Louis, where city families would meet with an independent clearinghouse to determine the best option.
Blues C Andy McDonald. He was terrific in the first round victory against the Sharks. His eight points are third-best through one round, and he had a role in all four Game 3 goals. Offense is hard to come by for St. Louis, so he’ll have to marvel again to get past Los Angeles.

The 2011-12 budget assumed revenues that everyone knew at the time were most likely falsely optimistic  and that's proved to be the case. The 2012-13 budget now being formulated will assume that voters pass Gov. Jerry Brown's tax package in November, and he's hinging passage on the false assertion that it will give a big boost to schools.
The move follows an early stumble at Disney's first big foray into standalone resorts: Aulani, the roughly $850 million hotel and time share that opened Aug. 29 on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Disney was forced to suspend sales in the project for two months this summer after it realized it had underestimated the annual fees needed to cover the resort's operating costs; Disney will now have to subsidize the fees paid by early time-share buyers for the next 50 years.

The Miami Heat is much more difficult to write off, but in the end, I can't see James sharing the ball/spotlight/credit with Dwyane Wade and, to a lesser extent, Chris Bosh. No matter how much James contributes, the Heat always will be Wade's team. Batman and Robin works in the NBA; Batman-Batman-Robin is a tricky proposition.

Saffold's daughter attended the same high school as my daughter; I was her softball coach in the late 1990s. My heart sank at this news. We don't know if she's the real culprit behind the comments, which included references to two death-penalty cases in Saffold's courtroom. We do know her mother was willing to let her take the blame.

"The administration supports efforts currently under way in the Senate to reform and modernize tax incentives and other programs that support biofuels," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.

New York had the same problem against Boston on Dec. 15, when Pierce hit a jumper with 0.4 seconds left to put the Celtics ahead 118-116 at Madison Square Garden. Stoudemire then sank a three-pointer, but it was waved off after officials determined that time had run out.

Doyle on the debt ceiling: Beaverton Mayor Denny Doyle weighs in on the debt-ceiling debate, in this guest column on The Stump urging caution before before cutting benefits for seniors. Doyle writes: "Congress is considering a provision to enact a co-payment for seniors who require home health care services. Essentially, this is a tax increase on seniors. It would take more money out of the pockets of senior home-health patients, of which three out of five live below the poverty line."
According to a poll published earlier this year by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 86% of unmarried people ages 18 to 29 are sexually active. And though it may not be surprising that 87% of the same group reported that they are not ready to have kids — including 88% of women and 86% of men — their actions don't always line up with their intentions.
So recently I headed to Yosemite National Park and the Ansel Adams Gallery, which offers free camera walks, as well as photo classes and multi-day workshops for a fee, taught by staff photographers. Many of the iconic Yosemite photos I adore were shot by Adams, who died in 1984, and I thought a lesson here would be the nearest thing to learning from the man himself.
There's nothing wrong with the wine list at Flora. It's very good, with 82 diverse selections, but on my three visits, I couldn't pass up the cocktails, which made ordering a bottle of wine impossible if I wanted to keep my wits about me.

Noticeably missing among those we saw were representatives of St. Louis' theater and arts scenes. We didn't see anybody from Grand Center, the Rep, the Black Rep, the Muny or the Regional Arts Commission. Granted, there was competition with the St. Louis Symphony Red Velvet gala, which was underway at Powell Symphony Hall. Perhaps it was just too busy a night for people to be everywhere at once in The Lou.
