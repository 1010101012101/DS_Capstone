I will not know her score until July, but I will know if she does not take the exam. Any student that does not sign up will miss two assignments. We discussed all of this last week in class."

The wine trail is an easy day trip from nearby hotel-endowed cities, but two outstanding inns also beckon at either end of the trail.

I'm probably a little less than that.
Looked like the Cowboys talked the Giants into running left on the failed fourth-and-1 late in the third quarter with some of their pre-snap movement. Manning appeared to change the play at the line because he saw the Cowboys’ front favoring the right side of the Giants’ line. But at the snap, they slanted the other way right into where the Giants were trying to run. That helped leave Lee unblocked for the stop. During the Cowboys’ mini-run, I had visions of that being a play we’d be talking about for days. The Giants’ winning the fourth quarter made sure it was all but forgotten by game’s end.
The risk factors for sleep apnea include obesity and having a crowded upper airway, such as from enlarged tonsils, a large tongue or a crooked nose. To determine whether a patient is suffering from sleep apnea, he must have a sleep study, which is usually conducted in a sleep lab, though testing in the home can be performed in certain cases. The sleep specialist uses data collected from the sleep study to look at the patient's breathing in sleep, as well as to examine for other sleep disorders and factors that may be associated with these. In some cases, a second test may be required to fully evaluate for the presence or severity of the breathing problems.

Back to the defense, the Capitals sucked the excitement out of what the NHL and NBC had hoped would be another marquee matchup between Crosby and Alex Ovechkin.

Sword ferns line the top of a horizontal branch like a green mohawk.
Jackson said he'd never had a game-ending hit until Thursday. His description of it -- what he did with Aceves' 2-1 pitch -- might capture the maturity he now seems to be achieving in his third big-league season: "I was still looking for a pitch to hit in my strike zone and doing my best to not do too much. When you put it in play, good things can happen."

Some of people's concerns have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost. The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Such a charge would be laughable if it weren't so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.
By inducting critical choices ahead of bestsellers, the Hall of Fame committee probably believes it is acting as the guarantor of rock ’n’ roll integrity. But part of the institution’s charter is to tell the ongoing story of popular music — a story that Bon Jovi dominated in the mid- to late-’80s. To leave Bon Jovi out of the Hall much longer is an exercise in selective history that gives the Hall a bad name.

According to Lennox, the home heating and cooling manufacturer, many home water heater thermostats are factory-set to 140 degrees when in fact most households would find 120 degrees to be optimal water warmth. What's more, for each 10-degree reduction in water temperature, homeowners can save up to 5 percent on energy costs. The steps for changing your hot water heater temperature vary depending on whether the unit is gas or electric. Gas heaters tend to have a calibrated valve, while electric hot water heaters have a screw-on thermometer panel. So do your research: Consult the owner's manual for your specific hot water heater before adjusting the temperature.

What went unsaid on both occasions was that the company was also quietly pursuing an outsourcing strategy that meant cutting hundreds of jobs in other parts of the business, including some white-collar positions in St. Louis.

"In other words, teachers' bad performance helped distort real estate markets. In the immediate postwar period, parents could look for any house they could afford, confident that the closest public school was adequate. That was not true beginning in the late '60s with the erosion and politicization of teaching standards and the subsequent 'sorting' of families into good and bad districts. But I don't suppose any 'mainstream' paper is interested in that investigation. It doesn't fit neat liberal narratives."

I hope that we're beyond polemics now and that it is no longer incorrect to think women can't be great writers. Lately, I've been thinking about three who lived near me in the Northeast: Millay (1892-1950), who traded bohemian Greenwich Village for a placid farmhouse in eastern New York state; celebrated novelist Edith Wharton (1862-1937), chatelaine of a mansion across the Berkshire Mountains from Millay in the upper-class summer haven of Lenox, Mass.; and the divine Emily Dickinson (1830-1886), who spent her whole life in Amherst, Mass., and thus "never saw a moor," though she could conjure up the universe in the space of a single stanza.

We do not need any of these landmarks. They are only a part of Baltimore's history. Sell the whole city. That should bring in a nice fat sum of money.

Mixed bag. The big concern is that his velocity was noticeably substandard, continuing a trend that surfaced during spring training. Wainwright has been blaming this on mechanics; an alternative (and maybe more realistic) explanation is that his arm's simply not all the way back yet.

You could have asked for much more than that from a guy making his first competitive start in a year and half, pitching on the road against one of the league's best lineups.

DETROIT -- The government's new road map for General Motors would briefly send it into bankruptcy, erase most of its debt and eventually have it emerge leaner and stronger -- and almost three-quarters owned by the taxpayers.
Speaking Tuesday at the online retailer's annual shareholder meeting in Seattle, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said that adding color to the Kindle's "electronic ink" display is a difficult technical challenge and that a color screen is "still a long way out." Bezos said he's seen things "in the laboratory" that are "still not ready for prime-time production."
Having said that, I think the question regarding submission is legitimate, and I think many of the responses in the conservative press have been misguided at the very least, and more often disingenuous. They are soft-peddling the doctrine of wifely submission, much as Bachmann herself did: submission is simply "respect"; it is merely a method for dealing with the tough issues in marriage that require a "tie-breaker". That certainly is one way of understanding biblical submission: it can mean almost anything, in practice. The concept of submission is very slippery and covers a wide spectrum of marriages, from rigid and oppressive patriarchy (which I think is rare) to equal partnerships covered with a thin veneer of male headship theology.
Police searched the area and found the hat and black jacket the suspect had been wearing on the 300 block of Eaton Avenue. The officers went to a nearby home and asked to speak with the people inside. When the third person came to the door, the witness was able to identify him as the assailant, Stevens said.
Civil protection authorities could not estimate the danger posed by flooding in the countryside Thursday night, but Desir said other villages faced the same threat.

Nuggets forward Danillo Gallinari tied the game at 86 with a long 2-pointer with 1:06 left in the game. But on the Lakers' ensuing possession, Gallinari fell to the floor on a screen by the Lakers' Pau Gasol, and Gallinari stayed on the hardwood as Ramon Sessions hit a 3-pointer with 48.1 seconds left for a 89-86 advantage.

Chancellor Jim Petro, head of the state's higher education system, introduced what he first called "charter universities" a year ago. At that time he said public universities could be assigned to tiers, based on how well they perform. Universities would have to meet or exceed benchmarks -- in areas including finances, operations and student success -- to be awarded that designation, which would allow them more flexibility.

The Kings have won seven straight on the road in the playoffs counting a pair against San Jose last spring and are in an enviable spot taking the series back to Los Angeles, with Game 3 Thursday night. They opened the first round with a pair of victories at Vancouver, taking that series in five games, but before that held just one 2-0 series lead back in 1968 when they lost in seven in the first round to Minnesota.

That's because this is his year. It's all lined up for him: He's a team captain and the best player at the deepest position on the Aztecs defense. After about a year of learning that defense, last season "was the first time Miles realized he could dominate," SDSU linebackers coach Kevin McGarry said.

Streamlined, to say the least. The "Angels" set, created by his longtime collaborator, scenic designer John Culbert, dean of The Theatre School at DePaul University, is beyond barren — two stories of dark steel centered around a chilly, tomblike bed. And that's all. It's not unlike Newell's set for "An Iliad," which resembled a sewer; or the set of "Three Tall Women," also centered on a single bed; or even the memorable set from "Porgy," a large white wooden square intended to recall the floor of an Outer Banks prayer house. "With 'Man of La Mancha,' Charlie wanted the audience so focused on the human story we never left the prison," Culbert recalled. "A lot of productions of 'La Mancha' have fantasy scenes that pull you out, but he had this great idea — that by not leaving the cell, you connect better with the emotional story."

House Bill 58, which the governor will sign today in Cleveland. The tax reform law contains provisions state and local officials hope will persuade greeting-card maker American Greetings to keep its headquarters in the Cleveland area. The company had considered a move to Chicago.
Hey, Tony: Going into the season with a rookie head coach, I had some optimism given the veterans on both sides of the ball: Mike Holmgren, Gil Haskell, Ray Rhodes, and Dick Jauron were all in the house. Yet Shurmur has looked like an overwhelmed rookie. Also, with Jim Harbaugh, Mike Munchak (and John Fox) as first-year head coaches in the same lockout offseason and in playoff contention, how can Shurmur be given a pass? I believe I've seen enough to say that Shurmur doesn't have IT as a head coach and Holmgren doesn't have IT as a team president. I love Cleveland, the Browns history, but in all seriousness why should I follow this team until after they're gone? I don't think I will. -- Michael Bluth, O.C., Calif.

We also missed whatever atrocity Christina Aguilera committed on the national anthem. I trust it was not a fiasco equal to that of Leslie Nielsen, pretending to be tenor Enrico Palazzo in "The Naked Gun." I have not watched Aguilera's gaffe on YouTube. YouTube was not MyTube at the ship's Internet Cafe, where the meter is always running on minute-by-minute charges. Marilyn and I spent 10 minutes there every other day, skimming only e-mails from relatives or our children.
Schaffer also said jury instructions were "an absolute mess" that may have misled jurors, and evidence related to other shootings in which an officer mistook a firearm for a Taser was not admitted at trial.

Generally, there's also roast chicken with a warm carrot, beet and walnut salad, with a thick zigzag of horseradish sauce swept across the bronze skin ($15.50). The coffee-rubbed pork shoulder ($17), which is destined to be a signature item, looks like a giant roasted garlic bulb cut in two, ringed with a thin layer of fat. It falls apart in juicy chunks, accompanied by a knob of braised greens and coarsely ground hominy.

Those misgivings only got stronger this year, as Romney doubled down on appeals to the hard right that betray his record, which suggests a leader who has been much more collaborative and focused on problem-solving rather than politics. Romney's wrong and inflexible position on the auto bailouts also gave us great pause, and his virulent attacks on unions during campaign stops in Michigan only exacerbated our troubles.

øThis app provides environmental tips in between rounds of a fast-paced "Whack-a-mole" type game where you are rotating the Earth to tap on the bad red "Xs" that appear for a short amount of time. If you succeed in hitting an "X," it turns into a green recycling symbol. Your goal is to keep tapping until the world is full of green. The environmental tips remind you to turn off lights when leaving a room and to unplug chargers after you are done with them. This frenetic-tapping arcade game of rotating the earth 360 degrees comes in four levels of difficulty. There is also a free version, but it has constant ads.

Normally it’s hard to find the anti-center, but you can pin it down fairly well over the next few nights. Look for a medium-bright star just above Venus, roughly three finger-widths at arm’s length above and slightly to the left.
While it will include some big and medium-size box retailers, it also will feature plenty of smaller stores and restaurants that will be closer to each other -- accented by wider sidewalks to encourage more walking and bicycling in the development. A village green area for outdoor events, such as a farmers market or live music, creates an important "sense of place," planners say.

A: That is still unclear and may be the subject of future lawsuits. The measure defines an emergency medical condition as something that seriously jeopardizes a patient's health, impairs bodily functions or causes dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Broken bones or internal bleeding obviously fall under emergency medical conditions, but something such as herniated discs might be debatable.

Once 2-2 after an impressive victory at Tennessee, the Broncos have allowed a staggering 238 points in their next seven games, an average of 34.0.
It’s just consistency and working hard on the basics like catching and throwing. I’m getting some real good athletes, so it’s just trying to get them acclimated to having that stick in their hand. It’s unnatural for them. Every kid that plays basketball has played some basketball at one time or another. Football, they’ve thrown a football before. They just don’t come out for a sport they’ve never played before. But in lacrosse, we get kids that don’t understand what the lines on the field mean. So the idea is to get them to stick to it and consistently teach them the game.

Hey, Tom: When Anderson Varejao got injured, it became painfully obvious that the F/C position was a weakness. Tristan Thompson can only do so much and I think everyone agrees that Ryan Hollins wasn't the answer. Any chance we will ever see Sasha Kaun and/or Milan Macvan in a Cavs uniform? Any chance they could really help or would we be wishing that they had stayed overseas? Are they really developing this season? How closely are the Cavs tracking them? -- Chris Stevens, Concord

My focus was an opportunity to become a much more significant player in the railroad parts industry. Unfortunately, industry demands were becoming much more rigorous, at the same time I was trying to merge my company of 60 employees with another 40.

Even if I didn't like him and didn't think he could make it in the majors, I still would root for him to recover 100 percent from the batted ball to the head -- physically and psychologically. In Huff's case, I'm not worried about the psychological part, because he's a tough guy. He's got a nasty streak to him, which a major-league pitcher needs, so I don't think he will be gun-shy when he returns.

But they share a cheekiness that runs through this exhibit. His reference materials are old photographs, which he re-creates in ghostly form, reducing busy scenes to single monochromatic moments. Again here, things aren't what they seem. Take "Spring Morning" — a lovely title for a painting. Except Batura has rendered us a massive train wreck set in the olden days.

The proof is in the devil's food. In one of our studies, we put three groups of subjects alone in a room with a very large piece of chocolate cake, the utensils to devour it and water. We told them they could eat as much or as little cake as they wished. But first, the members of one group were instructed to focus on the pride they would feel if they resisted the cake. Those in the second group were told to imagine the shame they would feel if they ate it, and the final (control) group was simply let loose, with no instructions at all.

Fortunately for Ruess, guitarist-keyboardist Andrew Dost and drummer-guitarist Jack Antonoff, have cracked his code for the band's second album, "Some Nights." (It contains "We Are Young," the sweeping pop anthem that has been No. 1 for four straight weeks.) "It's really tough," the singer says. "I can be a bit of a pill from a songwriting standpoint. But from this album, it was awesome. They'd been through that process with (Fun.'s 2010 debut) 'Aim and Ignite.' ... If I said, 'There's going to be a gospel choir,' the sooner they adapt to it, the sooner they can explain it to our producers. They can speak my language."

Before a packed courtroom in Freehold, Judge Ira Kreizman listed a litany of offenses, including 27 municipal court convictions and 11 Superior Court convictions.
Many of us cheered the "Arab Spring." We rejoiced to see corrupt dictators overthrown, and we hoped for the establishment of democratic regimes. But unlike in the U.S., democracy elsewhere does not always imply that individual or minority rights are protected. There is a growing fear that Islamic nations may be created that do not respect the rights of minorities.

This gripping and hard-hearted algebraic equation of survival glitters with brilliance and provokes a raft of moral questions. For instance, should the weak be protected in honor of our higher nature or sacrificed if that increases the likelihood the fittest will survive?

Tysabri sales increased by 14 percent to $399 million. Revenue from another MS treatment, Avonex, rose 3 percent even as unit sales slowed as worldwide demand decreased due to “unfavorable distribution channel dynamics.”
Chicken Soup is delicate and light-bodied, so an Italian Pinot Grigio - with light body and flavor - won't overpower the stock and vegetables. The more flavorful Iranian soup needs a weightier, fruity, well-balanced white wine with more assertive aromas and flavors like an Oregon Pinot Gris, Viognier or unoaked Chardonnay. A light, fruity red wine would work with Korean Chicken Soup, which incorporates Cornish hens that have slightly stronger flavor than commercial chicken.
Psychologists and educational researchers have pegged their average IQ at 107.5 to 115. That's only modestly higher than the overall European average of 100, but the gap is large enough to produce a huge difference in the proportion of geniuses. When a group's average IQ is 100, the percentage of people above 140 is 0.4%; when the average is 110, the genius rate is 2.3%.

And what about that Black Hippy collective that's been making so much noise lately? Well, Kendrick Lamar and Schoolboy Q will be joining Pusha T and Big K.R.I.T. on the Village pre-show stage.

DK: What about outside the building? I don't know who. The public, and me, has no idea who you have spoken with, the lobbyists you have met with. They have no idea what this administration has done to develop or germinate the idea of speed cameras. There are many, many theories out there, most are conjecture, and my job is to cut through that and get past what you say to what actually happened, and I can't do that because this office isn't transparent about those efforts.

Philistines in battle. After the victory Samuel "took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, 'Thus far has God helped us.'" We raise Ebenezers in various ways in our lives, don't we? On our microwave there is an unopened can of Alice Love marionberries. The first thing you'd notice if you saw the can is how pretty the label is; a bright pink heart on a bright blue band of color. You might also notice that the can looks a little old. It is. It's about 10 years old now, I think, and it serves as an Ebenezer for my husband and I. The can came to us as part of a "food pounding" from our church family, when my husband was out of work. So much food came that when we'd loaded it into our car there was no room for our children: someone else had to give them a ride home from church. We had no idea at the time what marionberries were, so we were initially reluctant to open the can. After awhile we had grown attached to it because it had come to represent God's faithfulness to us, His providence during a difficult time. To hold onto that can and look at it is a reminder is a ritual; one specific to only a few people, of course, but a ritual nonetheless.

Chinese leaders are at an impasse over corruption. Corruption has wasted resources, fostered human rights violations and created distrust between the government and its stakeholders. Corruption threatens the country's political and economic stability as well as the viability of the Communist Party. However, the party can't effectively address corruption (the abuse of entrusted authority for illicit gain) without empowering citizens to monitor government. And it can't empower citizens without enhancing respect for some human rights.

The Getty has passed on many major works over the years, but would the Munch pastel make sense for its European art collection, squeaking in just under the museum's cut-off date of 1900? Sure. As the most recognizable Expressionist image in the world, it would productively join the first Expressionist painting ever made -- Belgian artist James Ensor's monumental, visionary 1888 masterpiece of Mardi Gras madness, "Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889." (The Getty does own Munch's moody, melancholic midnight-landscape, "Starry Night," painted two years before "The Scream," but it's no match for that diminutive blast of alienated horror.) Imagine the raucous Ensor and the reverberating Munch hanging in the same room!

Fans got a tote bag; they should have been allowed to play shortstop (and couldn’t have done worse; the Mets went 0-9 on the homestand).

Grey is the lead vocalist and ringmaster of the seven-piece band from Jacksonville, Fla., which drew more than 500 fans to the cozy joint by the railroad tracks.

Paul Ryan's "grown-up budget" that punishes the elderly and children. The mantra, repeated most prominently here by U.S. Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, that half the populace pays no income tax, as if the working poor don't pay all kinds of other taxes.
