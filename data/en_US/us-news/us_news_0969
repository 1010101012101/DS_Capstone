Can you be sentimental about an energy bar? Apparently so, if you're Clif Bar. Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the company released a limited-edition new flavor, Gary's Panforte, inspired by founder Gary Erickson's early experiments in solid nutrition while cycling in Italy. It's spicy, full of fruit and grain. We wish it wasn't a limited edition.
Lowe, who was not happy with the way he pitched, enjoys throwing to Santana. They just had to get a couple of things straight. Lowe likes to throw his breaking ball to the outside part of the plate. Santana kept calling it inside.

Grey isn't the only young adult-film performer gaining wider exposure in Hollywood these days. Katie Morgan, a business-savvy 28-year-old who has made dozens of adult films, is appearing in indie director Kevin Smith's R-rated slacker-cool comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno, which opened on Halloween to strong reviews. Distributed by Weinstein Co., the film stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as a pair of down-and-out platonic friends in suburban Pittsburgh who decide to make an amateur skin flick to pay off their debts. It appears likely to be Smith's most commercially successful film.

The employees "saw the big sales (figures) we were pulling here and they wonder, 'If you can do that well business-wise and still shut down, where can we possibly go?'"
Wine informs every element of the venture. An electronic train board from Europe dominates the back wall; throughout the night diners can hear the rapid flip of letters, and all eyes turn. Instead of announcing trains arriving at the station, the board highlights special deals on last bottles. When one bottle sells, another flips into place.
He acknowledged that "we're not quite there yet" and that vehicles would probably never reach the point where the driver could fall asleep at the wheel for the entire ride.

Jackson was born Aug. 29, 1958, in Gary, Ind. His mother, Katherine, would say that there was something special about the fifth of her nine children.

When you're done with the dunes, every lodge offers late-afternoon game drives to spot zebras, ostriches, jackals and antelope. And, of course, the stars. One evening, our guide parked atop a hill, assembled a bar and starting pouring drinks just as the first brilliant pinpricks of the southern night sky appeared. Away from nearly all light pollution, the Milky Way was soon as obvious as the moon, a silent river of stars across the heavens. Champagne, good friends, star-struck zebras silhouetted on the horizon — it was night life Namibia-style, we decided, and the ideal antidote to the long road we'd traveled.

So there was plenty of consolation amid consolidation but this battle week seems a thinly disguised gutting of some problem picks from Team Blake, Team Adam, Team Cee Lo and Team Christina. There was little drama in last night's eliminations because by thinking like a ruthless record executive at Universal Republic, the label which will award a recording contract to this season's winner, you could have gleaned who was going home before a note was even discharged, based mostly on appearance, the very thing the Blind Auditions warned us against.

Reyes made it perfectly clear at the end of the game — which most figured was his final game in a Mets uniform — that he had spelled out his wishes beforehand. “I said (to manager Terry Collins), ‘If I go 1-for-1, take me out of the game,’ ” Reyes said. “And I did that.”

1. Pick up a one-year option When James signed his most recent contract in July 2006, it was mildly revolutionary. Since 1998, the NBA has had rules that limited how much players can earn per season and how long the contracts can be.

Sampling taken after the initial cleanup found elevated levels of several hazardous chemicals, including PCBs and lead, in the soil, water and sediment. Once widely used in electrical equipment, PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are considered probable human carcinogens, and studies with animals indicate they may cause immune, reproductive and other serious health problems. Lead, once widely used in paint and other products, can cause brain, nerve and other health damage in children who ingest even small amounts.

It also has a number of dining options, from the street vendors who serve up tortillas with meat or pork, or who cook corn on the cob on small barbecues, to several restaurants offering up classic Mexican cuisine -- everything from carne asada to tacos and enchiladas. Margaritas are on every menu. (One note: Because Mexicans eat their main meal in the late afternoon, you're not likely to find many restaurants open for an evening or late-night meal.)
Fiery bluegrass mandolinist Ricky Skaggs, together with his family and his band Kentucky Thunder, sings with plainspoken, awestruck wonder about the Almighty and divine miracles. The second volume isn’t quite as inspired as the 2005 edition, but it’s braver. Much of its material — “What Songs Were Sung,” “Reunion Song” and the breathtaking “Light of the Stable,” for instance — are the rarest thing in December circulation: Christmas songs that deserve to be in greater circulation than they are.
Fire Chief Ted Jury said an alarm sounded inside the 2½-story building at about 4 a.m. When firefighters arrived, smoke was drifting across Manchester Road.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — John Calipari news conferences are funny and ridiculous, frivolous and thought-provoking all in one session.
"I think the pressure that he puts on himself during the regular season, he felt like he underachieved offensively and now he's just playing hockey," Hitchcock said. "He's having fun playing in this type of atmosphere and I don't think he's looking at points or anything like that. He's competing at a high level ... he got off his own back and he's just starting to play."

The length of time a wine is aged in oak barrels depends on the style of wine the winemaker wants to create. In the regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy, it can be anywhere between 12 and 18 months, while in Spain, it can be more than two years. A lot depends on the grape variety. Those that produce more powerful wines benefit from the wood, while more delicate wines don't. However, it is important to note that a wine that imparts strong oak characteristics may not necessarily have been aged in oak. It could have been flavored by the use of oak chips, which are submerged into a stainless-steel vat. This method is mainly used to alleviate cost.

A combination of warm weather and high demand for spring fashions boosted revenue for the month, but analysts say there's much more than higher temperatures at play. Americans initially cut back on spending during the recession and have continued to hold back in the slow recovery, but in recent months they've been feeling better about the economy as the stock market rises and unemployment falls.
What Cremant de Bourgogne merely means is "sparkling wine from Burgundy," but nearly all of it is made in the laborious and costly "Champagne method," from well-respected grapes such as chardonnay or pinot blanc. It is produced by skilled winemakers or co-ops and costs a reasonable $15-$25 a bottle. In short, Cremant de Bourgogne is a gimme for a bubbly.

Beatty. There were a lot of people here and elsewhere saying, “Why no story on how well Beatty’s doing?” Well, because it’s a long season and he was only a quarter of the way into his first one as a starter. He’s been very good so far, but Sunday was a hiccup, as he allowed two sacks to Clemons, was flagged for holding Clemons on the first play of the second half and whiffed on DE Red Bryant to force a run for a 1-yard loss. Let’s see how he responds. And no, I don’t agree even a little bit with the occasional email and tweet I’ve received about benching him. No idea what those people have been watching because, again, he’s been good.

"We buy our products from a local dairy, we don't use preservatives, and we use real fruit in our toppings and purees," Kerlick says. "All of that adds up to a healthier alternative to frozen custard or really rich ice cream."
After that finding, the hospital withdrew Midei's practice privileges at the hospital and implemented "an enhanced state-of-the-art peer review process" for its cardiac catheterization lab.

Set to a jazzy piano and orchestra score by Morton Gould, "Interplay" serves up four movements of buoyant goofing off. The four men and four women, who have far too much fun to pair off for very long as couples, looked larky in costume designer Farrah Southam's Crayola box colors. The vibrancy ran through the dancing like a steady current, whether the pals were tracing curlicue line games, springing into cartwheels, playing leapfrog or jitterbugging in the dark. Hips waggled. The men sauntered. The women teased them, then joined right in.

Cookies and pies are American desserts that seem symbolic of the Fourth of July celebration. Forget the fragile seven-layer cake or crushable cream-filled meringues. Traveling food, designed to take the bumps in the road, is what most Independence Day menus are about. The movable feast, whether planned for the beach or boat, back yard or park, needs a finale that is easy to prepare and trouble-free to transport.
There's no public dispute about wanting to get cars off City Dock. The trouble is finding a nearby replacement for the roughly 200 lost spots. A dispute has grown out of a developer's proposal to build, at his expense, a garage, offices and stores at the site of the park. He would then lease the property from the city and Anne Arundel County Board of Education, which co-own the land.

That is to say the imperious tend to dig ridiculous opulence. The newly remodeled dining room at Pasteur, featuring chocolate-colored highback banquettes, huge wrought metal globe chandeliers and paneled wainscoting, is a swank respite from the traffic exhaust, street-corner hustlers and madness outside on Broadway. The adjoining private white-on-white dining room filled with white leather chairs and a column outfitted with birch branch tendrils is like something out of a Disney fantasy about a snow queen.
"We wanted to involve the community more," said Sheila Klehm, president of the Women’s Association of NJPAC, the volunteer board that organizes the party, which this year grossed $2 million. "Jennifer Hudson really gave us the platform to do that."

There have been times when I’ve gotten off the (ergometer, the land rowing machine) and thought to myself, ‘I’m never doing this again’ — the kind of pain that almost cripples you and you can’t get up and you can’t breathe.

She also inspired his artwork, which is proudly displayed throughout the home. A painter herself, Scott's grandmother put a paintbrush in his hand at a young age. He continues to develop his skill but only creates art to enjoy, not to sell.

Great "who knew?" question! In, uh, a nutshell: You heard right. For more than 50 years, a dilute bleaching solution has been used to clean and disinfect the outer shells of walnuts that are sold whole, not shell-less.

Large quantities of sodium hypochlorite also are used in processing fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, beef, pork, maple syrup and fish.

"The Art of the Sale" profiles a variety of salespeople, defining the sales function broadly. One of his most striking subjects is Abdel Majid Rais El Fenni, who has built a business in Tangier, Morocco, selling high-end rugs and other furnishings, rising above the typical merchant in the souk. Majid (as he is known) keeps "loose robes," meaning that he tries to be open and honest with customers, especially customers who fear that they are going to be hustled or cheated. Not that his customers always drive a hard bargain. Majid once closed a sale quickly after realizing that a tourist from Texas didn't care much about quality so long as he knew he was buying the most expensive rug—that is, he "equated quality with price" and "wanted more than anything to tell visitors to his home that he had bought the best rug in Morocco, at a price to prove it."

He is, as ever, funny. On the 30 percent efficacy of placebos, Jacobs writes, "You could view placebos as depressing, I suppose. So much of medicine is a sham.

Although first-term presidents typically temper their partisan excesses and authoritarian impulses until after they have cleared the hurdle of reelection, Obama has not. From his unprecedented public rebuke of the Supreme Court justices sitting before him at his 2010 State of the Union address to his ramrodding of Obamacare and his more recent refusal to brook any meaningful compromise on a contraceptive mandate greeted by nationwide protests, he has stoked fears about the "flexibility" he might exercise beginning in January 2013. It's a flexibility that could extend far beyond the realm of foreign policy, manifesting in a push for exactly the sort of radical social policies and big-government power grabs that animate the most liberal fringe of his party - the hard-core activists who have kept faith with him because they believe he is, deep down, one of them.

At Krave, a Korean barbecue truck in Jersey City, you can fill up instead on kimchidillas, a soft flour tortilla served with your choice of meat (short rib, sesame chicken or tangy pork), plus shredded kimchi and Monterey jack cheese. Or Korean tacos, with kimchi and onion-cilantro relish. The truck pays homage to the American slider with its Kravers, mini-burgers stuffed with meat and kimchi on a toasted brioche bun. I found them irresistible, although the Munchers preferred the BBQ rice platters, with sesame chicken in one and pork in the other.

That prompted the 1985 Fair Housing Act, and the creation of the Council on Affordable Housing to enforce it.

They considered taking everyone on a ski trip to Colorado or maybe a tour of wine country in Napa Valley, but the travel-hotel-food cost for such movable feasts was daunting. Uproar is a generous company - employee perks include a free gym membership - but a small one with 31 full-time workers. Then came a light-bulb moment.
Schuster says he's working on a new novel about a college professor whose life is "falling apart." It's not autobiographical, says the novelist, who seems to have plenty of reason for dreaming as he nears 60.

I didn't have a big master plan or even a business plan when I opened my doors for business. After working for another company for 10 years, I just knew I wanted to add value by working on heavy design-based projects. Instead, we kept getting more and more referrals, and before I knew it, I had eight employees working on buildings in all different industries.

Newsom, it should be noted, mocked the lieutenant governor's job after figuring out that he had no chance to beat Jerry Brown in 2010. Then Newsom put his finger in the air and the political winds convinced him that being Mr. Irrelevant was better than being Mr. Former Mayor of San Francisco.

Obama's re-election team has seized on a quote from Romney in 2007, when he said it was not worth moving heaven and earth to go after one person.

POWER: Alex Castellanos, OF, Springfield (AA). Drafted in 2008 out of Belmont Abbey College, Castellanos encountered some of the same issues other college hitters face when transitioning from aluminum bats to wood. He had to refine his pitch selection, and he had to figure out how to open up his hips, bring in his hands and get in on pitches that were in on him. "He's got a lot of raw ability," manager Pop Warner said earlier this season. "A lot of bat speed. At some point, he's going to have to shorten his swing a little bit more. He's been surviving because he has so much bat speed." Castellanos had 12 homers in the first two months of this season, and his 14 homers are still among the leaders in the Texas League. He's gone 10 games without an extra-base hit, though, as the S-Cards start seeing familiar faces in the tight-and-cozy league. Castellanos and Matt Adams were elected as starters for the Texas League All-Star Game.

Prosecutors contend that in order to dodge that obligation, Aventis entered into a private deal with the HMO Kaiser Permanente that repackaged Aventis drugs under a new label, allowing them to overcharge Medicaid programs for the same product.
As Haygood writes, Robinson was inspired into social action during that period by a conversation with -- of all people -- Prince Philip when he and Millie were invited to Buckingham Palace to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's birthday in 1969. When the Robinsons returned to L.A., he devoted himself to raising money for and working directly with young people we'd now call "at-risk youth." It was a successful -- if always financially precarious -- program that taught its participants physical skills, self-confidence and tried to impart a touch of Sugar Ray's ineffable class. Florence Griffith Joyner, the three-time Olympic gold medalist and athletic style icon, was one of its graduates.
Carlson is scheduled to announce his strategy at John F. Kennedy Catholic High School in Manchester, nearly two years after arriving in St. Louis and naming improving education as his top priority.

Veteran director Agnieszka Holland – whose credits range from “Europa, Europa” to episodes of “The Wire” – doesn’t always have this sprawling material under control.

My selections ranged primarily from 7% to 12% alcohol—numbers that non-German speakers would do well to note, as they are a fairly reliable way of telling if the wine will be dry or not. A percentage between 7 and 10 signals an off-dry wine, while a wine of higher alcohol is likely to be dry. There are occasional exceptions, like the dazzling, minerally 2010 Peter Lauer Unterstenbersch ($38) at 11% alcohol, which gave an impression of dryness but was actually analytically off-dry. I also tried some outstanding dry wines, like the silky pear-inflected 2010 Keller Riesling Von der Fels (12% alcohol) and the truly mouthwatering 2011 Leitz Eins Zwei Dry, as well as other trockens that were, well, rather tart.

Sandoz is the second-largest generic drug company in the world, and it said the deal will make it the largest generic dermatology product company in the U.S. market and worldwide. Fougera had $429 million in revenue in 2011, more than twice Sandoz's dermatology revenue.
The conclusion of my story on Camden Yards' future was, essentially, that it will last as long as it loved and cared for. That seems trite, I know, but since no one can predict how stadiums will evolve, that's probably the only reasonable answer. A sports management professor from Michigan told me that a stadium needs to be refreshed every five years, and it certainly seems like Peter Angelos has been willing to spend the money needed in that area. Technology could change the way parks are used, though it's difficult to see a way in which that would have a drastic impact on the physical layout of the stadium. The one real risk identified in my story is the lack of land near the stadium; owners are going to continue looking for revenue streams, and real estate near the ballpark has proved fruitful. Angelos and his family have thought about a few projects in the vicinity of Camden Yards -- a restaurant was once a possibility -- and there may be opportunity there in the future.
New Jersey food assistance programs are getting a $2 million increase in Corzine's budget. The governor also increased funding for state food banks in an economic assistance and recovery proposal presented in October as signs of the recession in New Jersey started to show.

Question: My 8-year-old grapefruit tree has been producing lots of fruit for the past three to five years. However, my wife complained that the plants in front of the house needed more water. Seems as a result, I overwatered it. A few months ago, it dropped probably 95 percent of its leaves. The grapefruit were slightly larger than a golf ball or smaller than a tennis ball. I removed the fruit, cut the water down, but there are hardly any leaves. What's up with it?
Justice Department officials had in many of these cases filed court papers stating the fugitive's whereabouts in Mexico — sometimes listing an exact address or tiny village — but Cook County prosecutors told the Tribune that this information was never presented to them, so they couldn't initiate formal extradition proceedings.

In the United States, the crisis is providing one boon, Bullard said. Investors flocking to safety have been snapping up U.S. Treasuries. That's driven down the rate on 10 year Treasurys, which are used to peg long-term mortgage rates. Rates on 30-year mortgages fell to 4.84 percent last week, the lowest this year.
Boosting the registration floor to $5,000 would still include everyone making a living as a consultant, without forcing the city to deal regularly with those doing only occasional political work. The change to monthly filing would mirror the requirement already in place for lobbyists, according to the Ethics Commission, which asked for the changes.

"Paying up" (May 6), regarding executive pay, made for some rather interesting reading. I was particularly intrigued with this: "And, while boards have addressed many of the shareholders' concerns, they haven't been able to assuage some critics, such as members of the Occupy Wall Street movement, who say CEO pay has simply gotten out of hand."
"I'm concerned about whether the owner is footing enough of the bill," said Sen. Julianne Ortman, the Senate's deputy Republican leader. "I'm really concerned that what we've got is a minority partner in this project dictating the terms, wagging the dog if you will."

John Clayton, ESPN.com: "Football is a sport that's violent enough. Having an incentive to hurt players can't be accepted. Commissioner Roger Goodell should deliberate this case and then make the biggest example out of the Saints so this offense won't be repeated. In Spygate, Goodell acted too quickly and did not penalize the Patriots and (Bill) Belichick as severely as he should have. Because Spygate happened early during the 2007 season, the Patriots and Belichick should have received a penalty beyond the fines during that season. A two- or three-game suspension of the head coach was warranted. For a bounty, Saints defenders were encouraged to hurt opponents. Now, Goodell must make the Saints feel the pain for their actions over three seasons."

Strategists in both parties predicted privately that the GOP had already essentially won nearly two dozen Democratic seats, while fewer than a handful of GOP jobs appeared to be lost. It was shaping up as a stunning turnabout from 2008, when Obama helped propel Democrats to big gains in their House majority only two years after the 2006 wave that swept them to control. It was the first time in more than 50 years that a party rode waves to bigger congressional margins two elections in a row.

"GUILTY EXCEPT FOR INSANITY" -- With the stage adaptation of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" continuing its engagement at Portland Center Stage, it makes sense to provide real-life, present-day context to Ken Kesey's original Oregon-set novel. Filmmaker and clinical psychologist Jan Haaken's documentary methodically details the experiences of patients and treatment professionals at the Oregon State Hospital (where the movie version of "Cuckoo's Nest" was filmed), shedding light on the existential limbo of people deemed by the justice system not guilty of crimes because of mental issues. 2 p.m. Saturday at Portland Center Stage, Gerding Theater at the Armory, 128 N.W. 11th Ave.; first-come first-served seating, $5-$10 suggested donation

As the canopy grows, consider moving the emitters out and adding additional emitters. Remember that in its native setting, a tree's canopy edges help direct rainwater to the roots.
