"We met with people and they were like, 'Well it's not signage because it's not advertising anything. And it's not an awning. And you're not building anything. It's art and we don't have a rule for this, so it's totally legal,'" Adams said. "The city wanted to be careful, though, so we showed them the model and the flammability specs of the material.

A. The most valuable thing my parents gave me was my instinct about people. I’m a pretty good judge of character. Who’s being disingenuous, who’s being sincere — it’s become very easy for me to pick up who aren’t my friends.

There's a shooter unafraid to take the big shot, for good and bad, with Ron Lewis then and William Buford now.

Curtis; his wife, Samantha (another fine performance by Jessica Chastain, who's been giving lots of them lately); and their hearing-impaired 6-year-old, Hannah (Tova Stewart), live in rural Ohio, where tornado shelters are part of the landscape. But tornados are a dominant part of Curtis's delusions. He's so obsessed by imagined storms that he takes out a loan he can't afford to turn his little backyard shelter into a huge and expensive bunker that represents safety for him and his family, and the depths of his subconscious for us.

The reason that seismic work on the double-deck section of Highway 40 (Interstate 64) has gone on for so long is that MoDOT broke the work into separate contracts.

According to the Tax Rate Statement for Measure G, it would be paid off in 25 to 40 years. The tax rate would be $30 per $100,000 of assessed value. Currently, the median price of a home in the 92804 area code, in which the district's Cerritos School is located, goes for $340,000. So for a newly bought home, the Measure G tax would be $102 a year. It would be less for a similar home that's been owned longer. And the tax bite could rise depending on when a home is purchased, inflation and property values.

The Vikings' longtime neighbors and rivals at Meramec, Forest Park and Florissant Valley have had the life nearly squeezed out of their athletic programs the last couple years. St. Louis Community College rocked the area sports scene earlier in the winter when, for the second time in two years, it took a cleaver to its athletics budget.

District officials say the cuts represent a savings of approximately $260,000.

My husband and I choose to send our second-grade son here. That's why Mayor Frank Jackson's educational reform plan is especially important to us: It's personal. Schools like this one, where his grand ideas are taking root, already show incredible outcomes. This school is only in its second year. Swiftly, it has proven what nimble public schools -- staffed with talented, dedicated teachers and held accountable by parents and society -- can achieve and inspire in an urban setting.
Now, here I am, sitting opposite my son as he marvels at what love can bring. He coos over the tiny hand grasping his finger, lifts his left ankle to rest across his right knee. That's when I see it. Bigger sneaker, same worn out spot on the sole.
By comparison, Cobb eighth-graders ranked 22nd in percentage passing that same exam.
(A new member of a committee on which I served once asked me why a senior colleague was being so horrible to him. I replied: "Oh, it's because when a new male baboon joins a troop, it's traditional for the alpha male to beat him up before becoming his best friend—soon he'll think the world of you." I was right.)

I should also point out that images on the new iPad aren't overly-sharp, and the screen's colors are true and lifelike. Many other tablet makers goose the screens' contrast and saturation. They do this for the same reasons why McDonalds puts to much salt and fat in their food: they know we all really, really like that. The other similarity between these two things is that they're aren't really good for us as our main diet.

Tuesday's premiere is set on the Caribbean island of Dominica. We meet the contestants as they rappel down a seaside cliff to a beach to meet host Shini Somara, whose bio runs in part: "By the age of 25, Somara had completed her doctoral thesis while working full-time as a mechanical engineer. Yet, she still found time to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and dabble in the world of fashion as a model. Somara also has a degree in classical ballet from the Royal Academy of Dance."
The Salvation Army began offering shelter beds at two downtown centers in anticipation of colder evening temperatures sending more homeless men and women to seek an indoor place to sleep at night.
The service: As with the food, the French Laundry is the gold standard of how service should unfold. Every aspect of the experience is carefully choreographed by Cunningham, who is so exacting that she brought in an expert from the American Ballet Theatre to give the staff classes in movement. Unlike formal French service, where only the captain answers questions, here everyone on the staff is up to speed and conversant. They move with confidence and ease, and pass off duties to one another like an Olympic relay team.

In its motion, the AHS claims the original order by state Superior Court Judge Joseph Cassini on April 26 was flawed because AHS wasn't notified.

Nail the finish: Once the ball is gone, maintain the knee bend and slight forward lean at the waist, with your left arm outstretched to the side for balance.

Nolan is tough and very smart, but she's unpersuasive in her efforts to characterize herself as a consensus-builder. Her track record in the Legislature on key issues involving taxes and transportation suggests a troubling tendency to ignore dissent, shrug off business concerns, choose the more partisan path and leave unnecessary bruises.

And what a ride. The truck makes slow progress, bouncing jarringly over rocks and into tire ruts. Every jolt sends shock waves up my spine, and my head is positioned disturbingly close to the dirt-encrusted blade of the pickax. The one benefit of crouching under the tarp is that we can't actually see the makeshift road to which the truck clings. My father later tells me the view from the cab was harrowing.

For now, they’re doing fine, and the grown-up feel of the rock scene is one of the town’s advantages. Montclair is one of the few New Jersey towns that New York sophisticates recognize as an autonomous community hip enough to adhere to big city standards of cool. The town boasts independent bookstores, some of New Jersey’s best dining, a respected art museum, and the presence of Montclair State University.

Former concertmaster Emmanuelle Boisvert was a casualty of the dispute. Disillusioned, she left last spring after 23 years to take a lesser position with the Dallas Symphony.

Fanning, unfortunately, is absolutely wrong as Cherie.

But she has yet to find the right platform, and with Cherie, she never finds her footing.

"Grimm" is still a new show, and the makers are finding their tone. How funny should it be? How gory? What's the proper balance between police procedural and supernatural stuff? What's worked so far, and makes "Grimm" refreshing, are the welcome doses of humor, the unforced chemistry between most of the cast, and the few, well-chosen scary moments. It's not so flip as to be off-puttingly ironic, and not so -- well, grim -- as to be a slog.

That's poised to change this year thanks to "Hunger Games," which cost a little over $80 million to make, including the benefit of tax credits in North Carolina, where it was shot. Given its relatively modest budget and advance money from foreign distributors, the movie needed to reach only about $100 million in domestic box office to break even, according to a person familiar with the picture's economics who was not authorized to speak publicly — a milestone it reached Saturday.
The second time they said goodbye, Brianne and Josh Debiak huddled around a car heater, fighting off fear and the early-morning chill with jokes and small talk. She told him she would kill him if he didn't come home safe.

"When you grow up an athlete and you live in a world that praises you all the time as you go from high school to college, college to the pros, the decibel volume, the number of people, the frequency of praise that comes your way, increases," said McPherson, who was with the Chargers from 1982-85. "By the time you get to play 20 years in the NFL, in 12 consecutive Pro Bowls, and all that comes with that, you're living in fantasyland.
After gesturing out my towels for a few months, it struck me that I had no idea of the economics at work here. It must be like computer printers - they practically give printers away to make money on all those pricy ink cartridges, a business model I think of as the Barbie Clothes Paradigm.

The HUD 108 loans will pass from the federal government to the city and county, and through to the developer.

Likewise, Nathan Iffrig, who runs a painting company in St. Louis and Edwardsville, started sending money to Paul last summer. By New Year's Eve, his seven checks had totaled $2,475, just short of the single donations from the well-heeled backers of Romney and Obama.

A week ago, Obama appeared on NBC's "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon," where he "slow jammed" the news in a bit about student loans. On Saturday, Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told a Washington Post forum, "I do think there was something a little bit off-key about the president slow jamming and appearing to make light of the fact that students are struggling." Romney, Fehrnstrom added, would have declined to do that skit.
Rep. Richard N. Adams, Republican of Troy, collects more than $50,000 a year in pension payments from STRS after a career as an educator.

To buck that trend, some of these diabetics, with the help of physicians who share their mission, are adopting rigorous diet and exercise regimens to get off insulin, or never have to go on it. Unlike Type 1 diabetics, who have no choice but to take insulin, Type 2 diabetics still produce some of the hormone -- and more than a few are determined to make the most of it.

Nothing in Maryland law would keep Mr. Woollard from owning a handgun, or a shotgun for that matter, and using it to defend his home. But carrying a loaded handgun into a street or other public place is another matter that has the potential to affect many other lives, and the state legislature determined long ago that the epidemic of gun violence in Baltimore and elsewhere requires some sensible limitations.

Soccerwise, my dad pushed the hell out of me, but it never felt like pushing because I loved it so much, Vermes said. He wasn't one of those guys on me to train, because I did that on my own, but he was critical of my play. He would tell me what I did wrong. He would tell me what I had to do to fix it, but then he'd let me go do it.
The Angels propped their win on a five-run third inning, all of which came against Lohse. The Cardinals righthander got his first win in his previous start, but his inconsistent and at times ugly season manifested quickly Saturday. He committed a throwing error in the third inning on a bunt and then proceeded to pitch himself deeper into trouble. Six consecutive batters reached base against Lohse in the inning and five scored.

In the draft: As much as some like Georgia Tech's Stephen Hill, it's hard to imagine the Lions taking a receiver in the first round. More likely, they land a speedster in the middle part of the draft who can help take the top off defenses or contribute in the slot. Michigan State's Keshawn Martin, Wake Forest's Chris Givens and Fresno State's Devon Wylie are names to watch.

While there may be a legitimate argument over what state law governs composition of the land bank board, there seems little doubt that, under its then-bylaws, the board may have overreached in March when it unilaterally "reappointed" Mayors Georgine Welo of South Euclid and Cyril Kleem of Berea, then altered the bylaws to make their positions on the board potentially self-perpetuating from now on.

"It should give you some pause when you see record yields predicted for corn, wheat and soybeans," said Bill Lapp, an agricultural economist based in Omaha, Neb. "Yet in spite of that you still see elevated prices for corn, at over $4 a bushel, wheat at over $7, and soy at over $10... In spite of higher yields, we don't have adequate supply to tame these commodity prices."
"Sterne Agee defrauded Madison County by recommending certain securities which enabled it to generate enormous and unjust commissions and fees to the detriment of Madison County," according to the complaint.

The audience of about 350 people was a genial assortment of Shakespeare devotees, neighborhood kids and people who apparently were so astonished by the sight of a full-sized stage at a city intersection (closed to traffic) that they froze in their tracks.

Still, Ford didn't want to dwell too much on JGR. His firing was a bit bizarre, though, because the No. 11 team had been quite successful under Ford. Hamlin fell just short of winning the 2010 championship but had a steep drop-off last year. That, coupled with Grubb being let go by Tony Stewart after guiding Stewart to the title, made Ford expendable.

"But what I like about him is he is a true passer first. ... I love his mental makeup. He's a leader, he's tough and most importantly he's smart."
Economic development advocates in Denver disagree. True, stations along the rail lines have been designed in tandem with local town redesign and rezoning, to spur transit-oriented growth (an issue for towns that now must wait decades for their stations). And a local real estate company, Your Castle Real Estate, found that along existing light-rail lines, property values had resisted the decline found elsewhere in the metro area. But improved transportation will provide a rising tide lifting boats across the region, advocates insist.
The last time Detroit played Texas, the Rangers ended the Tigers' season. It was Game 6 of the American League Championship Series in Arlington, and things got ugly early. Texas won, 15-5, and went on to the World Series, where they lost in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals.

Why it's hot: No bar better exemplifies the resurgence of Central Avenue's 600 block than The Local 662, which opened in the old Garage Bar space this summer. The bar serves up local music (and some national acts) on weekends, but on Wednesdays, it's all about St. Pete Soul — delightful old-school funk, boogie and R&B performed by DJs Funk Jesus, Gregg Schmidt and Sugar Bear. From Earth, Wind and Fire to Rick James to Morris Day to Erykah Badu, the grooves are irresistible and different from most anything you'll hear in any other club. "If you're into hip-hop, you'll like tonight, because you're going to recognize stuff that people have sampled," Funk Jesus said. "A lot of these songs are ingrained in your psyche. The songs are familiar to you, even if you don't know the artist."

Skepticism about sanctions abounds. With good reason. They didn't stop the Pakistani and North Korean nuclear bombs. It's not just Israel that is alarmed by Iran. France's foreign minister doesn't think Tehran is ready to compromise over its nuclear program. Britain's prime minister believes Iran is developing missiles capable of hitting London.

The flier says that even before the matter goes to the ballot box, it would "effectively remove education options for Maryland's children and students for two years."

It might long for the respect it probably now deserves as the fourth-largest city in the country, but to me Houston has always been nothing more than New Orleans if New Orleans took a bath, put on a suit — a rather ill-fitting one — and got a job. A job that leaves it with more money to throw down on the bar at five o’clock in the afternoon, otherwise known as the time when the serious drinking (as opposed to the possible lunch drinking) begins. Which then, of course, leads to the eating.
Men, women and children -- many dressed in period costumes -- marched in a mock funeral procession from City Hall, through a historic residential neighborhood, to a wooded knoll at the Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery.
When the Republicans had blocking strength over the debt ceiling, they failed to use that power to address unemployment. Instead, they were focused on scaling back growth in government spending and resisting tax increases. That played to the Republican political base, but it did nothing immediate to help the millions of unemployed Americans.

First up are the drinks, which include a classic martini -- made with gin, easy on the vermouth -- and a rummy Hawaiian punch. The latter is a particularly appropriate choice since Hawaiian Punch, the juice product initially created in the '30s as a syrup ice cream topping, was the focus for a classic ad campaign in the 1960s that introduced the character "Punchy" and the tagline "How about a nice Hawaiian punch?" That's an in-your-face approach that might have come straight out of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce agency.
