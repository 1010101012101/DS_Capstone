If there's anything coaches like less than a cheat, it is a hypocrite. Should Harbaugh's Ravens bend the rules so much as a centimeter going forward, they can expect payback to be prompt and derision to be deafening.

It seems ridiculous that after seven years of producing and debating bridge replacement proposals, this would happen.

One good measure of valuation is the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio: the value of the company divided by its earnings, or how much money it makes after it pays for its costs. P/E is a good measure of valuation because P/E tells you how much investors expect the company to grow in the future. (This is because what an asset is worth is, in theory at least, the "net present value of its future cash flows", or how much you're paying now for the money it's going to make in the future. So the higher the P/E ratio, the more money you expect the company to make in the future.)

Little Bits escalated from wearing his underwear backward to wanting to wear all clothing backward. Now, wearing underwear backward isn't that big of a deal (except that he is always picking his ill-fitting under garments out his rear) but when he wants to wear his pants or shirt the wrong way round, we start to have problems. I had to sit him down and tell him a few things, "First of all, jeans are not made to be worn that way, and it's hard to walk with the zipper in the crack of your butt.

As far as the public knows, Sea Shadow was never equipped with weapons because it was merely a test platform, and never engaged in any actual military missions. But as a test vehicle, it was successful. Some of its stealth architecture can be seen in contemporary Navy ships such as the Arleigh Burke-class of guided missile destroyers.

Jeff Schuster, executive director of global forecasting at J.D. Power and Associates, said Japan plant shutdowns could result in production cutbacks at U.S. auto plants over the next two to three months.

"There are potential down-ballot implications with a candidate like Gingrich, who is so well defined with Republicans and Democrats, someone who has such a big gender-gap problem, someone who reminds everybody of the 1990s — and not necessarily in a flattering way," said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.

"My husband, Adam, cooks for maximum flavor," she said. "His eating was more focused on the entree as the meal. I like half the meal as salads and vegetables. I've learned to follow his flavors in the sides. If he's cooking an Asian dish, I'll make edamame as a vegetable and use a sesame-ginger dressing on the salad. We've learned from each other.

This was only the second time Williams had faced Kansas since leaving the school where he spent his first 15 years as a head coach, taking the Jayhawks to the NCAA title game twice -- they lost in both 1991 and 2003 -- and two other Final Fours. Though Kansas fans have softened some -- Williams was still greeted with a chorus of boos -- Williams said Saturday that facing his old team will always be unpleasant.
In a somewhat surprising move, Nunes worked with the No. 1 offense for most of the game, and Nottingham played with the second-team offense against the first-team defense—mostly because Shaw wanted to see him get pressured more, but also because he had seen plenty of Nottingham in previous, softer scrimmages.

Hard to believe, spring training is already here. You know what that means, right? Only a few more weeks until the NFL draft. … My synopsis of the baseball season: (1) Pitchers and catchers report, (2) Spring training games commence, (3) Opening Day, (4) Pirates mathematically eliminated. … Did you see where Cheat, er, Chad Knaus, Jimmie Johnson's perennially rule-breaking crew chief, has been suspended and fined yet again by NASCAR? My question: When are drivers like Johnson going to start getting suspended for employing underhanded cheaters? I've said it before and I'll say again: What's the difference between Barry Bonds claiming he didn't know what his trainer was giving him to enhance his body and Jimmie Johnson claiming he didn't know what his crew chief was doing to enhance his chassis? … The issue isn't that the Red Sox banned beer from their clubhouse earlier this week; it's why baseball teams allow beer in the clubhouse in the first place. Just lends credence to what I've always contended: Baseball - the only sport where you can play 162 games and gain weight.

NEW YORK -- Bank of America is closing down one of its mortgage units.
Even if the reform law falls, the exchanges are still worth having. Although the provision of the federal law that critics object to most strongly — the mandate requiring everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty — would play a central role in achieving lower insurance costs, the state health exchanges themselves are a separate issue that don't depend on whether the mandate is constitutional. The exchanges can't force anyone to buy coverage, nor will they have the authority to directly set insurance rates. Their purpose is to set minimum benefit packages for insurance plans offered in the state and select the best values for consumers at a variety of coverage levels.

Everything flows from the sly audacity of the premise -- rival champions who join forces to become the first male/male pair in figure-skating history. Mr. Ferrell's Chazz Michael Michaels is as frowzily macho as Mr. Heder's Jimmy MacElroy is ethereally fey. And though the plot twists that unite them are ingenious, the genius of the production, directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon, lies in its performers, who play their ludicrous roles with fervent seriousness. (There's no way of knowing who did what with the script, which is credited to five writers: Craig Cox, Jeff Cox, Busy Philipps, John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky.)

Suppose we increased the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon, from 18.4 cents to 43.4 cents. That would raise $291 billion over the decade from 2012 to 2021, estimates the CBO. Or we could advance the ages for early and full Social Security benefits; one suggestion is to raise them (now 62 and 66) by two months a year until reaching predetermined targets (say, 64 and 70). The CBO reckons the decade's savings at about $264 billion. How about slowly moving Medicare's eligibility age from 65 to 67. The savings: $125 billion.
Newark spokeswoman Esmeralda Diaz Cameron said the city is not at fault. "The city can not tell an employee what to file," she said. "In addition, the city has over 4,000 employees making it difficult to track one person’s W-4. The city would never knowingly fail to comply with an IRS directive."
The claim: The Sentinel said Marco Rubio is "brimming with ideas…" So said a Rubio mailer.

Still, the paper did say the first part — and gave Rubio its endorsement.

They are at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, in which the body can't make enough insulin or can't use what it does make to process sugar from food.

The expansive beauty, serenity and relative safety of these two parks offered ideal spaces to train.

Why, for example, would any spy agency assign a seriously unseasoned trainee to such an important case? Why would a seasoned agent take on such a liability as a partner (or know as little about him as he clearly does)?

"He came in and said, 'Everybody is going to say we have easy games coming up, that all we have to do is show up to win the games,' Batum recalled. "But he reminded us that we have to keep a good approach. That it is about us. We have to take care of business."
We ended up being very wrong, of course: Of all those shaky defenses that entered this tournament, only one — the generous Belichicks of Foxborough — remains. Indeed, three of the teams in the Final Four are superb defensively, and in the age of offensive dominion, what conclusions should be drawn from this?

Oregon's production at the plate has been the story thus far this season. The Ducks are batting .285 with 77 runs scored. If they can maintain that level of production against top-tier teams over one weekend, it could be time to wonder just how far this UO team could go this season.

The bills are among dozens of reforms to Arizona's child-welfare system planned in the coming months.

Abigail's Two stars 493 Roger Williams Ave., Highland Park; 847-849-1009. The downsides to this 48-seat American restaurant are the lack of reservations (save for the 5-6 p.m. seating) and the extremely loud noise that 48 seated and 24 hopeful diners can create in a small room. Chef/owner Michael Paulsen offers considerable compensation in the form of ingredient-dense but cunningly balanced fare, from daily flatbread pizzas piled high with goodies to memorable fish entrees in a sea of crispy/crunchy/smooth vegetables. Very good service and smoothly professional hosts (who manage to seat people efficiently and who play fair) are big pluses as well. When summer rolls in and the season renews at Ravinia (about a quarter mile away), this place is even more popular, though sidewalk tables at least boost capacity some. Recommended: Fennel-crusted scallops, Moroccan-spiced whitefish, duck with corn-ricotta ravioli, sticky toffee cake. Open: Dinner Tuesday-Saturday, lunch Tuesday-Friday. Entree prices: $11-$21. Credit cards: DC, DS, M, V. Reservations: Accepted from 5 to 6 p.m. only. Noise: Conversation-challenged. Other: Wheelchair accessible.

"I was quite intent on making a more poppy record," Thompson said. "This was really the next step from 'Separate Ways,' and I was just trying to sort of improve upon that in every way."

It reached a pitch last week at the Verdi Club in San Francisco's Mission District, where a sold-out crowd of 300 people greeted Strayed's unveiling as Sugar with a standing ovation. She was preceded onstage by musicians, a comedian and seven "women of The Rumpus" who wore fishnet stockings and orange gloves with "Hell's" on one hand and "Bells" on the other. They read questions and answers from columns by Steve Almond, who originated the "Dear Sugar" column in The Rumpus before passing it on to Strayed. Almond wrote "Dear Sugar" in the persona of a woman who had been around the block a few times and wasn't above a snarky response. Strayed, he says, took a more nurturing approach and turned the sometimes-reflexive hostility of the Web into a community of supporters.

Although it seems like a modern creation, the hot-and-cold, cake-and-ice-cream concept has been around for nearly two centuries. But it was after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 that chefs at the famed New York restaurant Delmonico's added a dessert called Alaska-Florida to their menu. By the early 1900s, this same dish of cake, ice cream, and curly clouds of meringue was featured in Fannie Merritt Farmer's "Boston Cooking-School Cook Book" as Baked Alaska.
"But we'll definitely be watching and rooting and cheering, and they'll hear us all the way in New Orleans," Emily Lighty boasted. "We'll be wishing them nothing but the best. They deserve it."
-- Legal recourse is much easier if you can sue in an American court. Suing overseas companies is difficult and often fruitless, especially because liability laws in other countries generally provide much less protection than U.S. laws. If a supplier does not do business in the United States, a lawsuit is likely to be ineffective.

The upheaval of today's Middle East is surely comparable to the disorder in Europe that followed the French revolution and, under Napoleon's banner, spread military turmoil across the continent. The Middle East still hasn't absorbed the Iranian revolution of 1979, let alone the Arab Spring that is shaking the Sunni world. It's a region begging for a new concert of nations that accommodates conservative monarchies and new republics.

And later that same year, Wyden and Republican Sen.

Proposition 8's backers tried to claim that the decision by then-U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker was invalid because Walker is gay. That was always a faulty argument — divorced judges rule on divorce law, judges with children decide cases in juvenile court, judges of all races resolve civil rights claims. Now, a three-judge panel of the appellate court has made it clear that the reasons for rejecting California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage were not the result of one judge's personal situation but rather were based solidly on the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which contains the guarantee of equal protection of the law. There must be a rational basis for laws, rather than a desire to single out a particular group. During the trial, lawyers and witnesses for Proposition 8 failed to establish a valid argument in favor of the amendment to the state Constitution that limited marriage to heterosexual couples.

About every 10 games or so, I ask him if he wants Paul George to be more assertive offensively. And every time I ask, he looks at me like I'm half nuts (I get this look a lot from people) and talks about all the other good things George does -- like defend, rebound, pass the basketball.

The starting shooting guard on the Bulls' second three-peat teams suffered his injury with the Clippers in January 1990. He disputes the theory it changed his game from a high-flying scorer to a defensive specialist, saying he averaged over 18 points his next four seasons and toned down his offense merely because he later played alongside Jordan and Scottie Pippen.

In the 1980s, when "cocaine cowboys" made Miami lawless, the U.S. government created the South Florida Task Force to interdict cocaine shipped from Central and South America by small planes and cigarette boats.

Today, Pete Seeger is approaching the far end of a life lived walking hand in hand with American history, often at odds with the government that runs things. It failed to shut him up.

Quick charging is a convenience, but at this rate, you clearly wouldn't want to make a habit of it. The electric car advantage comes from charging at home, which costs less than $3 for a complete charge. Another question is how much a Level 2 public charge will cost.

Psychologist Dr. John Gottman, who does some of the best research on why marriages succeed and fail, calls this the “emotional bank account model” of relationships. He writes in “The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work” that romance is kept alive “each time you let your spouse know he or she is valued during the grind of everyday life.” He explains this as a consistent “turning toward” each other rather than turning away: Remaining engaged in your partner’s world by reuniting at dinner and asking about each other’s day; consistently expressing fondness and admiration; showing love in the tiniest of ways. Essentially, Gottman explains, you need to treat your partner like they’re important even when you’re in the supermarket together and they ask something mundane, like “Are we out of bleach?” Instead of shrugging apathetically, you say, “I’ll go get us some so we won’t run out.”

Competing against Buscaino in the Jan. 17 runoff is state Assemblyman Warren Furutani, a former board member of the Los Angeles Unified School District and Los Angeles Community College District.

New Jersey scientists have said there is a legacy of pollution downwind from Pennsylvania power plants such as the GenOn plant in Portland.

Now, U.S. Rep John Dingell, a Dearborn Democrat, has begun congressional hearings -- the first in decades -- into cosmetics safety. At least three pieces of legislation would give the FDA more enforcement power over cosmetics.

However, Judge Bolton's decision may stand if the Supreme Court follows its precedents on immigration, which have held that immigration law rests entirely with the federal government. Her opinion relied heavily on a 1941 ruling in which the justices struck down a Pennsylvania law that required aliens to carry an identification card. She quoted Justice Hugo Black's comment that such a state identification system would infringe "the personal liberties of law-abiding aliens" and subject them to threat of "police surveillance."

Another bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter increases minimum wages for workers who earn tips. They are not covered by current state laws, but federal regs say they must get at least $2.13 per hour base pay, and if tips don’t bring them up to minimum wage, employers must supplement them. Sumter’s bill, which has no Senate counterpart, requires workers who rely on tips to get base pay of at least 40 percent of the prevailing minimum wage, supplemented as needed. Such workers haven’t seen an increase in base pay since 1991, although tips probably rose as the cost of meals and travel went up.

Failure to raise the meaningless debt ceiling for the first time in American history (the same one that was upped seven times under President George W. Bush and 18 times under President Reagan) would have disastrous results: U.S. standing worldwide would be shaken; interest rates for all individuals and businesses would increase; growth, jobs and economic recovery would reverse; and, in sum, result in an economic and humanitarian catastrophe. Default, or even near default, would make our financial situation much worse and much more difficult to fix.

Case against (See also trade up): Browns need to find out what McCoy can do with an upgraded supporting cast. Even if they aren't high on McCoy, Tannehill would need time to develop, and the Browns can't afford to wait on anybody.

"When you're used to throwing big league games with big league adrenaline, sometimes you try to create it. It's a different feel," McClellan said.

I was trying to throw the ball through a wall instead of pitching to my strengths.
The attention picked up when he broke the 100 record. "I was in dis- belief," he said. "I thought maybe I'd get the 200 record at some point, but I never thought I'd touch the 100 record. My coaches were telling me it was a 10-flat hand time, so I knew it was pretty good if that was the hand time, and once they told me 10.27, I sat there with my head in my hands."

By last season it was clear that Third Rail was outgrowing its home at North Portland's Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center. When the center's available dates for this season didn't match the company's needs, Third Rail decided to head downtown. The move provides about twice as many seats (220 as it's set up for "Dead Funny") and a nicer-looking facility. A few days ago the 700th season subscriber signed on, up from 535 at the end of the '07-'08 season. The company's budget has jumped from $202,000 to $350,000, thanks in part to grants from the Meyer Memorial Trust and the Miller Foundation to help with the move and to pay for administrative work.
