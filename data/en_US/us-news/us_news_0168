A:What I have done in the past is I do what I call "a buy back program." I have kids sort through and pick out their favorites.

Second courses include the pastas. I love the ridged pasta with foie gras, black truffles and a hint of sweetness from Marsala, but I restrained myself from ordering it this time.

NEWARK — Negotiations to prevent 167 Newark police officers from being laid off have all but broken down in a torrent of acrimony and miscommunication between Mayor Cory Booker’s administration and the city’s largest public safety union.
Having grown up in a Baptist church, where belief in miracles was said to be the key to Heaven's gate, I came to realize long ago that a lot of what we hear from the pulpit is a sedating myth. Marches, candlelight vigils, laying teddy bears and flowers at the scene of a shooting have become sorrowful habits that only address symptoms of the problem.

The way we figure it is, at least we have a game that promises to be managed by two adults standing in the same room, and the fact that they can’t stand each other is coincidental.
But the trips will cost about $20,000 total. Most of the kids can't afford it.
Too bad, then, that Winterbottom, Curran and the cast can’t quite make Thompson’s mad story convince. It’s one thing on the page, where you’re almost as horrified by the idea of some person actually writing this as you are by what you’re reading. But on the screen, actually watching it happen, it begins to fall apart.
Unlike other historical fiction writers who pride themselves on their research, Hauser uses facts only as a skeleton for the story.

"Since I was 8 years old, I knew I was a writer. I followed a very predictable path to realizing my dream," she wrote. "But all this time, I tried to deny what I knew was a big part of what I'd been put on this Earth to do -- provide as much real, no-holds-barred information for women with breast cancer, and in particular, those who carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer genes -- as I could."
The case is among several statewide that seek to enforce a state law that allows transfers from unaccredited districts such as St. Louis and Riverview Gardens. The Missouri Supreme Court already ruled in 2010 in the Turner vs. Clayton Public Schools case that such transfers are valid. That landmark case has since been sent back to a lower court.

The amendment was essentially identical to the one voted on in 1995. It would have required the government to balance its books within two years of ratification, but no sooner than 2017.
But some of Russo's court actions have earned our scrutiny. Between 2002 and 2008 -- when Russo was the court's administrative judge -- he hired at least 40 people with political and personal connections to him or to others in county, waived some job requirements for a number of them, and didn't bother to post some job openings, a 2009 investigation by Plain Dealer reporter Rachel Dissell found.

"We were so thrilled," said Pemberton, who has coached the team since its inception. "At the beginning of the season I was really focusing on districts with Boca Raton and Spanish River because we had to get through them first. They are obviously two of the best teams in the state...It is one step at a time really. The kids would ask me where we are in the standings and I would say, 'I'll let you know when it is over.' I count the points when it's over."
The short, intense February session hasn't been easy on either of the House co-chairs. In addition to wrangling over spending, both have been the subjects of recent unflattering news stories.
Body parts were also recovered at a former landfill in Staten Island, where debris from the site was transferred. In 2008, a judge rejected a lawsuit brought by several families of Sept. 11 victims who sought to move the debris to a plot of land that could be transformed into a cemetery.

"If you said, 'At the halfway point of the Pac-12 season, what is the single most improved area for this basketball team?' I would have to say our ball movement, our passing, our ability to play together,'' ASU coach Herb Sendek said.

Some photographers park themselves on the first picturesque spot they see upon entering the park, Tunnel View. So many iconic images have been made from this well-worn vantage point that offers an almost-180-degree view of the Yosemite Valley. With the help of a few passing clouds and the right atmospheric conditions, the sunsets at this spot can be phenomenal. And then there's a bonus sunset: Even after colors recede from the sky and sunset appears to be over, a second sunset usually follows where rock features glow bright red-orange, a phenomena appropriately called alpenglow. It's one of the great treats of the Sierra Nevada and a gift to patient photographers. Valley View, another sunset spot, provides a low level view of El Capitan, Cathedral Rocks and Bridalveil Fall, with the Merced River providing the lower part of the frame and the skies above forming the upper frame. This location has been used so many times that the holes in the sand formed by tripod legs are almost petrified. I also like Glacier Point and nearby Washburn Point, where you can see Vernal and Nevada falls and get a great side view of Half Dome.

Nan Kahl, a Chandler city clerk's assistant and former SEIU member, was among those who quit. Before she left the union she held leadership positions in the group and was an active volunteer who helped organize SEIU's water drive to benefit the homeless this year. Kahl declined to publicly discuss her reasons for quitting but said the boycott and SB 1070 controversy appears to be the biggest factor in the mass exodus. She also said personal finances may play a role for some. Union dues are based on a percentage of employees' pay and some whose spouses have lost jobs are now the family breadwinners, she said.
Officials at the state Department of Human Services say they don’t like the decision, either, but they don’t see a way out. They say requests for help from brain-injury victims ballooned as the economy soured, and they don’t believe there is an appetite to raise the 50-cent fee on car registrations that provides $3.4 million a year to the fund.

The crash spurred a law that limited the number of supervisions courts can give drivers to two in a 12-month period. The change, enacted in 2006, meant a driver found guilty of a third violation within 12 months must receive a conviction.

A 2011 National Academies of Sciences report finds that the total warming of the atmosphere, and consequent instability of climate, is directly proportional to the carbon we emit.

London theater has also long been a cultural standby for travelers and Londoners alike. It used to be cheap. No longer, with a few exceptions (see If You Go box). London's mainstream West End theaters bristle with long-running musicals like "The Lion King" (12 years and counting at the Lyceum Theatre), whodunits like the Agatha Christie warhorse "The Mousetrap" (a staggering world record 60 years at St. Martin's Theatre) and revivals such as Harold Pinter's 1978 broken-marriage drama "Betrayal."

Dan Porat was transfixed by the photograph of the little boy, thrust from the Warsaw ghetto by Nazis, their guns pointed at the women and children, the little boy's hands held in the air. It is a powerful image, testimony to the cowardice and cruelty of the Nazis. The photo was taken in spring 1943 and appeared in the Stroop Report, named after SS Gen. Jürgen Stroop, who organized the massacre and ordered the subsequent document. There were 125 copies of the Stroop Report, with the words "The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw Is No More!" emblazoned on the cover. It contained many photos, including the one of the boy, 7 or 8 years old, with the caption, "Pulled from the bunker by force." For Porat it is a kind of ground zero — he moves outward from the photo to identify the moment, the generals and soldiers who engineered the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto and the people in the photographs. He follows the lives of two Jewish children, the boy and a teenage girl, and three Nazi criminals, including Stroop, before and after the war. A reader goes back, again and again, to the 60 photographs that accompany the text. It is like pinching one's skin after a dream to see if one has woken in the same world in which one went to sleep. Or first opened "The Boy."

"We were honest, that's how I approached it," Graham said. "We told them, 'Hey, this is what we're about. Here is how we see you fitting or not fitting.' There was a lot of work that needed to be done, I can tell you that. Anytime there's a change like that there's a lot of unrest."
Fox's cooking brings up comparisons to other top restaurants, not because his creations are derivative but because their sensibilities are so pristine. Heirloom tomato salad ($10) could easily be served at the French Laundry; the perfectly ripe tomatoes are arranged with burrata, several kinds of basil, olive oil and sherry vinegar. Mushroom pizza, with a puffy rim browned in the gas oven, begs comparisons to Chez Panisse Cafe. The crust, crisped in a wood oven, is topped with a frothy mushroom mousse and Bellwether crescenza ($14). Toppings change often: figs with braised greens and blue cheese ($14) or broccoli di cicco with Bellwether crescenza, for example; or dollops of romesco sauce and a fried egg in the center ($14).
Frangos believes deconstruction should be pursued, even though he isn't sure just how close the local industry is to being self-sufficient.
There's an amphitheater where the likes of Sammy Hagar, Willie Nelson and Don Henley perform each summer, followed by a Concours d'Elegance car show in the fall. And on it goes  culinary center, jewelry shop, wine caves, gardens and deli. Even if a wine enthusiast doesn't get lost on the sprawling and terraced grounds, he is almost sure to forget what drew him to Ironstone in the first place.

Bruce, of Teaneck, was the first of a dozen fans who gathered on a high berm overlooking the hanger where the white jet plane with Houston’s body pulled into shortly after landing about 10:30 p.m.
The victory was doubly welcome because the infantry-gunboat combo of Grant and Admiral Andrew Foote had captured Fort Henry on the Tennessee River 10 days earlier. Gaining those forts, separated by 12 miles, opened the heart of Dixie to Union armies and forced the rebels to abandon Nashville, Tenn. They were the first significant federal victories of the war and were bell-ringing tonic for Northerners still smarting over the humiliation at Bull Run, near Manassas, Va., the summer before.

The immigration case, like the challenge to Obama's health care overhaul, pits Republican-led states against the Democratic administration in an argument about the reach of federal power. The redistricting case has a similarly partisan tinge to it, with Republicans who control the state government in Texas facing off against Democrats and minority groups that tend to vote Democratic.
That said, Wright’s presence is needed. You saw that Wednesday in their Grapefruit League game with the Detroit Tigers. Minor-leaguer Wilmer Flores was playing out of position at third, making two errors on one play. If the Mets play like bums here, it’s going to set a bad tone. "We’ve got time," Collins said. "But there’s a reason we’re here so long."
"There were many story lines," Hoffmann said.
Stay away from a mother gator with babies. I came within 10 feet of one family - an amazing experience, but probably too close.

Servers often recommend the barbecue, and it's a satisfying direction to go in. An on-site smoker sends out lightly smoky beef brisket ($18 plate/$12 lunch sandwich), pulled pork butt ($16/$12) rimmed with melty fat, and baby back ribs ($16 half rack/$25 full). You add your sauce, spiked with mustard or sweet.
The decision by the 11th Circuit is hundreds of pages long, but it all boils down to one rather concise notion: The government's position that the individual mandate is constitutional "amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual's existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life. This theory affords no limiting principles in which to confine Congress' enumerated power."
Earlier this year, Dillon's claims bill was derailed in a bit of political gamesmanship involving House Speaker Dean Cannon. Haridopolos is right to try again.

He'd previously made 49 career starts in the leadoff spot, with a .286 average, nine home runs and 20 RBIs.
The sustainability of the shale boom is debatable. Some experts say it's a sham, that production from "fracked" wells will be expensive and peter out more quickly than wells drilled conventionally. Fracking also faces stiff environmental opposition due to heavy water use and groundwater contamination issues.
Interest in Indian culture created a black market for pots and other artifacts, and that, in turn, led to the passage of antiquities laws and the establishment of national parks and monuments, where sites could be protected. In 1931, Canyon de Chelly became a national monument. Questions about the canyon's past remained.

The failure of the federal government to fix our broken immigration system has led to recent actions on immigration by Arizona's policy makers. What we have now is a divisive, emotionally charged environment that is tearing at the fabric of Arizona's sense of community and threatening the essence of our historically diverse culture. Regardless of how individuals feel about Arizona's immigration laws, the negative, unintended consequences such as damaging our relationship with our largest trading partner, creating tension in our communities and generating calls for inappropriate boycotts, are significant.

_ ARE THERE MORE INJURIES TO COME? There's a lot of hoops left to play, but let's hope not. Injuries (Does Kobe Bryant's stomach bug count?) already did in the Bulls, Magic and Knicks, and are even playing havoc with the U.S. Olympic team. But if you believe the schedule is to blame, keep your eye on the next round: Some teams may have to play on back-to-back days in the postseason, the last remaining obstacle from the compressed schedule.

Not so Cusack, at least, whose performance as the dissolute genius is fierce and full-blooded. He's a lovely Gothic sight, sweeping down cobblestoned streets in his cape; there's real bite and brio to his attacks on "hacks" like Emerson and Longfellow. As a critic, Poe was unsparing.

Over the course of 18 minutes on the phone, here's what I learned about Kroenke and where he's going with his plans to turn this franchise around: First of all, he has not been sitting idly by as the Rams went from a team of promise in 2010 to a team of disappointment in 2011. He was gathering facts all along the way but didn't make up his mind absolutely until he woke up Monday morning.

State Street would not comment on its reason for hiring Alo, its only registered lobbyist in Ohio, because the bank generally does not comment on client matters.
The star is Robert Downey Jr. His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony. (He was much better in the first "Iron Man," but he's quite good here.) "The Avengers," which takes place in murky darkness for the first half hour or so, begins to lighten up figuratively, if not literally, only when Iron Man appears and we see, on the lips of the man inside the red robotic rig, a faint smile that says "this is going to be fun." The fun in seeing his teammates lies mostly in watching them in action, although they quarrel comically among themselves at the outset like superdivas: "We're not a team," Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner says, "we're a time bomb."

25 percent: Only one-fourth of registered voters participated in the 2010 primaries, even though Republicans hosted a series of competitive races for Congress, including the Senate race. Another low-turnout election would hurt Lugar, as those most upset with him are certain to come out in large numbers. Lugar would benefit from a broader electorate on May 8, but that may occur only in the unlikely event that the Republican presidential nomination is still considered uncertain at that point. In 2008, primary participation roughly doubled because of the Democratic presidential primary.
Once the show actually got underway, Hathaway — proud product of Millburn High — seemed game and at ease, despite the number of hair and costume changes she had to race through.

Last month, Buerger estimated the company would sell for $400,000 to $600,000, but on Monday he said he figured it might go as high as $750,000.

Jeff Schultz, Atlanta Journal Constitution: "Once you get past the emotional side that says Bobby Petrino just got run over by the karma train, once you get past the misguided Arkansas fans who started a Facebook page in support of their morally bankrupt coach and carried signs such as, ‘What's wrong with scoring in the offseason?' this much is clear: Arkansas had no choice. Bobby Petrino went 21-5 the last two seasons as a football coach in the SEC last season. He's out of a job. What does that tell you? This is a sport where college presidents and athletic director have been known to give only lip service to matters of academic reform and ethics - and whatever flawed mindset exists in other conferences, it's safe to multiply that by 10 in the SEC. What Petrino did, however, exposed a public university to too much litigation and potential financial damages."

2008, United States, 95 minutes. This is an old-fashioned, straight-ahead documentary about the 34th annual Miss Gay America Pageant. Directors Ron Davis and Stewart Halpern profile five of the contestants. Some are pageant veterans, others are looking for that big break. Getting ready for the pageant isn't a sashay in the park, but a full-scale, sequined assault. The costumes look as if they were designed by the cake creators on the Food Network. And while it's all great fun for the audience, it's serious business to the drag queens strutting the stage.

“We need to make sure its identified in the county as a priority, and that will happen in the next few month," Cogen said. (Cogen's opponents, Mike Darger and Wes Soderback, were not present at the forum.)
It's tempting to shrug off Beach House's “we don't want to be popular” attitude as a pose, but they remain adamant on making “Bloom” only “about the music,” a phrase that transformed into a rallying call over our hour-long talk. They turned down multiple publications for interviews and photo shoots. When Sub Pop brought up the possibility of “Bloom” being sold in Starbucks, the band refused. It's all a concerted effort to avoid cashing-in on quick fame.

"It's definitely a step forward in trying to characterize what's there and how these interactions are supposed to occur," said Dr. Neil Kao, an internal medicine specialist at the Allergic Disease and Asthma Center in Greenville, S.C.

However, it is a whole another gigantic step as far as identifying something else that will interfere with how things work along with not causing side effects."

So, in return for paying 82 percent of the property taxes to support the port, suburbanites get 25 percent of the control. Worse yet, in three of the last six elections in which county voters renewed the tax used to fund the port, a majority of voters in the city voted against the renewals. The issues were approved solely because of overwhelming support from suburbanites.
To be sure, some spending reflects the effects of the Great Recession. But most doesn't. As Haskins shows, spending on the poor has increased steadily for decades. Consider food stamps. There are now about 45 million Americans receiving an average of $287 a month in food stamps, up from 26 million in 2007, according to a new Congressional Budget Office report. But the number in 2007, when the economy was healthy, was roughly 50 percent higher than in 2001.

Call it the "Dodgers tax." Pay-TV analysts expect Guggenheim Baseball Management, the investment group that paid an astronomical sum for the Dodgers, to recover at least part of its investment by charging a sky-high fee for the right to broadcast the team's games. With local stations and cable channels run by Time Warner Cable and News Corp. expected to get into a bidding war for those rights, the team is virtually guaranteed a multibillion-dollar contract — not unlike the one the Lakers won last year from Time Warner.
Tony Anziano, toll bridge program manager for Caltrans, told lawmakers that the overall approach to quality assurance on the Bay Bridge tower foundation went well beyond tests conducted by Wiles, which used radiation to measure concrete density.

"What do they have to be afraid of?" Alexander said. "Why would they be using closed session to make unflattering remarks that might be disrespectful to certain people?

While I'd love to ban soda, bright orange corn puffs, and pretty much anything containing High Fructose Corn Syrup, it'd be OK with me just to hold food processors to a standard of full disclosure about what's in what they offer, and to ban subsidies for junky food ingredients so real food can compete on an even playing field. I maintain hope that real food would prevail if we stopped paying people to eat badly. - Catt White, farmers market manager (Twitter @LIMercato)

The skinny: It's an absolute mystery why this wonderful event isn't routinely listed alongside Bonnaroo, New Orleans Jazz & Heritage and Lollapalooza as one of the nation's top festivals. The lineup is usually as good -- if not better -- than those affairs. Indeed, there was one year when I caught Bob Dylan, the Decemberists, the Dandy Warhols and Hole -- four of my all-time favorite acts -- in just two days at Bumbershoot. This year's lineup has yet to be announced, but trust that it should be an incredibly hip mix of hip-hop, indie-pop, mainstream rock and other styles. It all goes down at the Seattle Center, which means that the Space Needle serves as a dramatic backdrop to the music.

Mexico has many other great seafood dishes; be sure to ask about regional cuisine wherever you visit. It changes with the season, and you'll find recipes that pop up seasonally during Lent. Try the camarones en aguachiles (shrimp with chilies and lime juice) and tiritas (strips of marinated fish) in Zihuatenejo, the sopa de mariscos (fish soup) in Mazatlán, cazón (baby shark) in Campeche and the almejas (clams) in La Paz. Nik San in Los Cabos serves the most sublime sushi and sashimi I've ever tasted and nearly every seafood restaurant will take grill the freshest fillets mojo de ajo, with bits of charred garlic.

The latest "reform" push has legislators vowing to crack down on auto-insurance fraud.
No calculation process is going to feel 100 percent fair to every person. If we really want "fair," we should add up the cost of a person's care each year and have him or her pay that amount, selling only catastrophic plans that every man, woman and child would pay exactly the same amount for. When you get groceries, you don't pay 10 cents for a gallon of milk while the guy next in line pays $6. You pay what the people bringing milk from farm to table say it costs to get it there, and then some. We only control how much milk we drink.

Draft class features one elite RB prospect but a number of good ones, most of whom should be available in the second, third and even fourth rounds. Browns still believe Hardesty can justify his high draft status; taking Richardson would be an admission that they missed on Hardesty pick.

Under a potato-chip moon, the landscape shifts constantly, as if a bumbling stagehand is randomly raising and lowering sets. In Krazy's language can be heard New Orleans Creole, Yiddish, Spanish and Elizabethan English -- sometimes in the same sentence. The look and the language perplexed many readers, but devotees would include poets T.S. Eliot, e.e. cummings and Carl Sandburg, and artists such as Willem de Kooning."

Reproductive endocrinologists are working with oncologists to spread the word about options for women and are taking a team approach to fertility preservation. If their doctors don't bring up the subject, women and their partners or advocates should do so before treatment starts. Raising the subject can be challenging because pursuing fertility preservation can delay the start of treatment. It's important to keep in mind that some kinds of cancer treatment may not be a threat to fertility or may pose less of a threat than other kinds. In addition, the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis may increase or limit options for fertility preservation.

Robin Ventura could use some luck as well. Ventura, GM Kenny Williams' surprise choice to succeed Guillen as manager of the White Sox, has never managed at any level. And he still has Adam Dunn and Alex Rios on the roster.
The GM has the 1B he signed in what became the coup of 2010 free agency. The GM has a front office that he has stocked – and now he has Jeff Luhnow's spot to fill with his own selection.

More than half the communities received ratings of one. But at less than 10 percent, these communities have very little diversity. Census data from 2000 were used because they are the most recent information available for small places.
Amid those promising numbers, however, were complications.
For a variety of reasons, the two other teens depicted get less — and less effective — screen time than Alex. Though we hear from Kelby Johnson, a 16-year-old from Tuttle, Okla., who was ostracized when she came out as a lesbian, we do not see her being taunted. And young Ja'Meya Jackson of Yazoo County, Mississippi, who took her mother's handgun to her school bus to stop chronic bullying, is in so much trouble that we hardly hear from her at all.
Like the trees that line our streets, massive arching beams of wood intersect in a central corridor of vertical columns. Multiple levels of clerestories carry light penetrating far into this hall, casting a dynamic dance of shadows across the terrazzo floor. Maple ceiling panels are accented by recycled redwood from an old Mokelumne River bridge. Louvered glass walls are canted to the mountains. When this city was founded in the 1840s, the heat and swampland was unbearable. But by planting and protecting trees, the area between the Sacramento and American rivers was made habitable.
"We expected these results," said Dan Romportl, executive director of the Committee to Elect a Republican Senate. "The protest candidates were recruited as placeholders and we didn't put any resources behind them. ... This is more of a formality and we can move on to the final stretch."

A Time Warner executive brusquely dismissed my idea over the phone ("You have to be **** joking, Howard Cosell?"), but I decided to press on, if only to embarrass Time Warner.

Carmelo Anthony scored 19 points, and Tyson Chandler had 12 points and 12 rebounds to lead New York past a Magic team that appears to be sliding headfirst back into the soap opera that has trailed center Dwight Howard all season.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, Cleveland I think is a great example of cities all across the country, but especially in the Midwest, who are starting to reinvent themselves. These are typically manufacturing cities. They were built on the auto industry, on heavy manufacturing, steel. And as manufacturing has become much more productive, fewer workers are in manufacturing -- even though manufacturing continues to contribute a lot to the economy -- and so these regions are having to think what's going to be the businesses of the future that end up employing more people and providing more opportunity. And small businesses are going to be the ones that I think are going to be making the biggest impact on regions like this one -- a lot of risk-takers, a lot of entrepreneurs here.

Redd said he watched the game at home in Columbus on Saturday and then texted Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith: "Win it all."

The film opens on a shot of two closed doors behind which best friends and roommates Kim (Krysten Ritter, who co-scripted with Coiro) and Deena (Kate Bosworth) are entertaining unseen male guests; the two stars make their entrances in search of a condom, with Deena claiming the last one available. Skip forward to a year later, and Kim is saddled with an infant son (played by Connor and Zachary Ross). Celibate since that less-than-magical night and ensnared in a miserable job running errands for a posh canine-rights organization (run by a massively overplaying Kristen Johnston), Kim is forced to tackle motherhood alone, with the still happily, hiply single aspiring writer Deena serving as her unreliable live-in baby sitter.
The thoroughly modern exterior, which features a flat roof, expanses of glass and steel siding, could easily have looked out of place in the a neighborhood of pre-World War II bungalows, cottages and Tudors. But Bader made a conscious effort to have the home blend in with the older housing stock.

During his first day on the stand Tuesday, Pettitte recalled the crucial conversation, which took place at Clemens' home during a workout, as: "Roger had mentioned to me that he had taken HGH." Pettitte's testimony — as a reluctant witness with no ulterior motive — is considered vital for the prosecution's case, which otherwise relies heavily on Brian McNamee, a former strength coach for both Pettitte and Clemens who says he injected Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone.

How do we help her to avoid the pitfalls that are best avoided and soften some of the collisions that are part of maturing and living?
Hi, Carolyn - I think I might be making the classic mistake of doubting my marriage because of how it compares with others'. My friend sometimes refers to her husband as her "best friend," and talks about how they tell each other everything. I think this is a nice ideal, but that's not how my marriage works. I love my husband, he's a great partner and I love sharing my life with him, but I rely on mom/sister/friends for a lot of stuff as well. Is it bad that he's not my best friend? - "You're great, but ...

Everyone needs to pay attention, then, when Bernanke talks about the limits of the Fed's powers. He made that point at Jackson Hole last year and expanded on it this year, commenting at length on the need for the nation's finances to "be placed on a sustainable path." He added that episodes like this summer's debt-ceiling impasse 'seriously jeopardize the willingness of investors around the world to hold U.S. financial assets or to make direct investments in job-creating U.S. businesses."

Some advice about Molinari's, an Italian eatery in Mentor: Reserve a table in the lounge area. On a recent weekend evening, a boisterous crowd packed the bustling space, which features the restaurant's stone oven, retail wine room and bar. My party, on the other hand, was seated against a back wall in the dining room, a decidedly less-inviting spot. Still, we enjoyed. Meals begin with a complimentary ramekin of Tuscan bean dip and sesame-seed flatbread. We followed that with a Margherita pizza ($15), a toss of basil, tomato sauce, and fresh mozzarella baked in the stone oven. Don't expect the characteristic charred and bubbly crust; instead you'll discover a passably thin and uniformly round one. The deep-fried cubes of gorgonzola and polenta standing guard were an imaginative touch. A very rich bolognese sauce of pork, veal, beef and pancetta gets a big thumbs up. Vegetable risotto lacked the smooth consistency of the Milanese-style dish, but vegetarians desiring a substantial portion won't be disappointed. My second suggestion is to buy a bottle of wine. In place of a wine list, Molinari's peddles wine at retail prices from a "shop" next to the bar. There's a $5 corkage fee. Service is very good -- largely, I bet, because the experienced servers have been here for a while. Our server offered knowledgeable suggestions; that alone made me want to return. But only if I can sit amid the revelers. -- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer
Potiskum General Hospital, the only major medical facility in the town, took in 34 corpses from the attack, an official there said.

But there’s still not quite enough going on here, either in terms of humor or excitement; small children are likely to be disappointed by the paucity of silly slapstick or bathroom gags, while their older siblings will probably fidget at the lack of scares.

The plot was a reminder of the ambitions of al-Qaida in Yemen, the most active and dangerous branch of the terrorist group. While al-Qaida's core in Pakistan has been weakened over the past decade, instability in Yemen has allowed an offshoot group to thrive and set up training camps there. In some parts of the country, al-Qaida is even the de facto government.

Aldridge finished with 26 points, seven rebounds and two blocked shots and was a beast in the fourth quarter, when he played a starring role in the Blazers' surprisingly clutch finish. Before the game, coach Nate McMillan lamented that the story of the Blazers' season thus far had been fourth-quarter collapses -- they've blown seven games in which they led entering the final period -- and late-game execution was an emphasis in an extended film review session during a Sunday afternoon practice.
Monet's "Poppy field at Vetheuil" and van Gogh's "Blooming Chestnut Branches" were discovered undamaged in a car parked at a mental hospital in Zurich soon after the robbery. The heist was conducted by three armed and masked men who witnesses said spoke German with a Slavic accent.

Pain can stop you in your tracks faster than Dwyane Wade's sprained ankle sat him on the Miami Heat's bench.

This highlights the second benefit to Washington State should you run here this year. Several of the current Democratic candidates in the open Congressional Districts ran for Congress in 2006, 2008 and 2010 - only to lose to relatively weak Republican opponents in swing districts. Given the poor track record of our current selection of Democratic challengers, there is a real danger in all three open seats of Republicans winning the election. In contrast, you have not only won 80% of your past elections, but more important, you have won those elections by defeating Republican incumbents in Republican districts. You have done this by getting huge numbers of independent voters to switch their votes from Republican candidates and vote for you instead. Given the large number of independent voters in all three open Congressional Districts in our State, you would be the ideal candidate to help us keep at least one of those Congressional Districts in the Democratic column.
