This is an essential point, the heart of everything, made all the more so because Franzen's fiction is not autobiographical in any overt way. And yet, what else could it be when literature is, must be, the result of "a personal struggle, a direct and total engagement with the author's story of his or her own life"? Such an intention runs throughout these essays, whether critical (takes on Paula Fox, Christina Snead, Donald Antrim, Dostoevsky) or experiential (an account of bird preservation efforts in the Mediterranean, a tirade about the effect of cellphones on urban life).

The wine's silver color is tinged with orange. The aroma is expressive, floral, tropical and complex. The taste displays an amazing pop of acidity, with the complex characteristics of the aroma playing a role. It's a delightful mouthful. 90 points.

There are several keys to the care of chronic disease from both the patient's and the physician's perspective. Immunologic activity in MS, particularly early on, may be hidden with symptoms that manifest in a mild manner. The goal of disease modifying medication is to decrease ongoing inflammation that later leads to the development of disability. Consequently these medications are considered preventative. Use of FDA approved therapies as directed by an MS specialist provides the best opportunity for reducing and targeting the underlying disease activity.

When using Kobo's devices (and its apps for the iPad and Android tablets), users read with Kobo Pulse, a brightly colored, interactive, multifaceted interface. Externally, a single click with Kobo Pulse will tell Facebook or Twitter what you're reading or post a short passage. But the inside of the book is really dynamic: You can see who else is reading what you are, join in the comment string on a page or start one, view statistics about the book and see everyone's comments within it. A vivid green bookmark drops where you left off reading, and statistics about your own reading habits accrue. There are snazzy awards buttons you earn by finishing more pages, using Kobo's dictionary, highlighting and sharing, and doing something unusual like reading through the night. Although the awards are essentially meaningless, they tempt new users into exploring the service fully. So far, it's the most fully developed social reading interface to come from an e-reader.
The term itself is irrelevant. It's not an offensive term, just one that means different things to different people. One woman was insisting that her use of the term was correct.

"I can't watch leisurely," Matheny said. "I'm always dissecting swings or mechanics and trying to figure out what's a guy thinking here. Having some inside information now and knowing about guys' health during the season that most people may not know.

For almost a thousand years, pilgrims have come to Durham to see its cathedral. It was built around the year 1100 to house the much-venerated bones of St. Cuthbert. The architecture is unusually harmonious because it's all one style. The cathedral was built in just 40 years and survives essentially unaltered. In the rest of Europe, this kind of architecture would be called Romanesque. But in England it's called Norman, named after the invaders who brought it from France. Round arches and zigzag carved decorations are textbook Norman.

Cormac McCarthy is credited with cornering the contemporary market on stories about people whose worlds are governed by the fierce, unsympathetic laws of nature.

The homer, which came on a first-pitch fastball from Oakland reliever and former Orioel Jim Miller, was Davis' first homer onto Eutaw Street and the 59th to land there in Camden Yards' 21 seasons.

Borrowing a line from conservative critics of the judiciary, President Obama declared that the Supreme Court would be engaging in "judicial activism" if it threw out the 2010 healthcare reform law. Responding to a question at a news conference Monday, Obama said it would be "an unprecedented, extraordinary step" if the court overturned "a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress." He added that such a move would be a good example of the lack of judicial restraint that conservative commentators have bemoaned for years.

Pop goes the pride of Northeast Ohio. "El Camino" comes on strong with "Lonely Boy," a fierce opener with a pinch of T. Rex glam.

The end result isn't a quantum leap, although it's another welcome step from the restlessly creative Black Keys, who continue to branch out beyond their no-frills roots. Bring on the frills.

Finding a good 100 percent agave tequila under $25 is nearly impossible; ditto for single-malt scotch and cognac.

Beyond the warm greeting that he received at Pioneer Courthouse Square upon his arrival in the summer of 2007, it's pretty much been a kick in the teeth. Blame Oden if you'd like. Tell him he owes the organization the courtesy of seeing this through. But then, look around the NBA and see how infrequently loyalty and success have a dance together.

Al-Qaida couldn't make the transition from violent jihad to nonviolent Islamist politics. That wasn't its DNA.

And, bizarre as it sounds, the cannibalism claim kind of makes sense, right? We're the ones who say that we consume flesh and blood in the Eucharist, and when we were doing so in secret for fear of persecution I can imagine that the rumors going around about us must have been pretty strange. Judaism, on the other hand, has strict prohibitions against the consumption of blood in any form. It is hard to imagine a more egregious form of attack on another faith - to take something sacred (Passover) and conflate it with something reviled (consumption of blood), and then to take that falsehood and intentionally use it as an excuse for violence and retribution.

President Barack Obama threatens a veto, a position repeated this week.
That's not just wishful thinking. Social Security is the oil tanker of government programs and doesn't turn on a dime. Corrections made early will be far less disruptive. Consider, for instance, the variety of factors that shortened the program's route to insolvency this past year: a higher cost-of-living adjustment as a result of rising energy prices and lower-than-expected worker earnings. The effects of such seemingly modest adjustments are huge because they resonate for years to come.

Offering a variable rate would carry some risk for the government: It would have to pay investors more if rates rose, as many economists predict they will in coming years. Yet the government might consider that risk worth the benefit of attracting more investors drawn to the prospect of potentially higher yields.

The agedashi tofu  tofu that is battered and deep-fried  was one of the few letdowns. The cubes of tofu were on the large side  and about as exciting as plain toast. They were not cooked all the way through, and they could have been marinated in something to give them a hint of flavor.

At the end of the day, we'd all end up in our coveralls over at Hanno's or the M&M."
It only makes sense. Since being booted from the Ducks last season he has only three avenues to travel. Transfer down a level and play next season. Make a lateral move and sit out a season, play in 2013 and enter the 2014 NFL Draft. Or, do what he's doing now, make the jump and hope for the best.

Then came my brush with the crack. Certain it would make a fool of me, balking at the idea of trusting a mere hole in the wall, I began climbing halfheartedly. Only this time, at the point of no return, I paused, weighed my options, and went for it. Next thing I knew, I was at the top.

Obama will also call for increased use of biofuels and the construction of four new advanced biofuel plants in the U.S. within the next two year. However, advanced biofuels -- fuels made from non-food sources such as wood chips, switch grass or plant waste -- are still in their infancy and cannot yet be made in amounts similar to corn ethanol. Congress has directed more money to research and development of those fuels in recent years as some critics of corn ethanol have linked the diversion of corn for fuel to rising food prices.

Any potential Young fallout isn't about political correctness or overly heightened sensitivities. If Young were the recipient of racially influenced venom against African Americans there would be considerable outrage against the perpetrator and sympathy toward him.

“The left tackle spot was vacant. We had a freshman there and I felt like I could fill that spot to help my team out,” Carmon said. “I thought that’s a way I could take our team to the next level and that’s what I did. I had to lock in every day. I had to make sure I brought my ‘A’ game every day, and I took in the coaching. That’s what got me the opportunity. I took coaching and made sure when I went to the office, I focused at all times. It was pretty tough but it was a better thing for someone of my size. That’s where I could make it in the long run.”
"I think going to the movies will be the No. 1 priority next weekend but clearly was not the No. 1 priority this weekend," said Paul Dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. "There's so much anticipation for `The Avengers' that the newcomers kind of got lost in the shuffle."
"This is how it is," he said. "Your dirt farmer from Iowa, or wherever it is, gets here with a little pile, just about enough to keep him, and at first, after freezing his face in those blizzards for forty years, it's great. He has a swell time, sees the Mt. Wilson Observatory, the Pacific Ocean, the millionaires' houses in Pasadena, the Huntington Museum, and Hollywood; he's never seen anything like that before, and he loves it. But then what? There ain't no more. After six months he's so sick of doing nothing that he'll take fifteen dollars a week, or ten dollars a week, or three dollars a week; or he'll start any kind of cock-eyed business, he'll do anything, just to keep busy. And boy, maybe you think that baby can't hate union labor! Because union labor, anyhow the way he figures it, means that pretty soon he's out of a job, and there's nothing for him to do but water the grass."

It's outrageous that contractors were told to bid way low and then come in with costly change orders later. It's a taxpayer rip-off and unfair to honest contractors. We need to require contractors to show that they can deliver the project for the price quoted. Changes over 1 percent should require a high-level administrative review, and changes above 5 percent should require approval by the council and executive.
Fruits and vegetables are sequestered on the salad bar, if there is one. Sometimes packaged salads are offered, with lettuce, cherry tomato, carrot coin or broccoli florets, regardless of season. Fruit, if offered, is frequently Red Delicious apples from Washington state, and even oranges from Florida and Mexico may be offered. There are exceptions of course, and there are numerous school nutrition service directors in California who make an effort to have an abundant, seasonal salad bar, and to incorporate fresh, seasonal vegetables into made-from-scratch or freshly prepared entrees and soups. In Davis, for example, I've seen kiwis and blood oranges in winter, strawberries and sugar snap peas in spring, and butternut squash and heirloom tomatoes in fall, along with seasonal soups and organic rice bowls. It can be done.

The memo is about salesmanship, not substance. It doesn't address whether the lines are accurate. It just says they are effective and that Republicans should use them. Indeed, facing a Democratic plan that actually relied on the free market to try to bring down costs, Luntz recommended sidestepping that inconvenient fact:

Additional assistance to Afghanistan must be accompanied by concrete mechanisms to ensure greater government accountability. In a country that is 70 percent rural, and where the Taliban recruiting base is primarily among under-employed youths, a complete overhaul of our civilian assistance strategy is necessary; agricultural sector job creation is an essential first step to undercutting the appeal of al Qaeda and its allies. Increased assistance to Pakistan will be limited without a greater willingness to cooperate with us to eliminate the sanctuary enjoyed by al Qaeda and other extremist groups, as well as a greater commitment to economic reforms that
The bill supposedly requires a permit for those taking 1 million or more gallons a day from a river, stream or groundwater source, or 2.5 million gallons a day or more from Lake Erie.

In a political culture constantly paying homage to the working-class creed, few would -- or should -- say that such blue-collar laborers must simply "shut up and work." It should be the same standard for athletes. The more these public figures exercise their right to speak out on major issues, the more they help teach younger generations that politics is not a game only for Washington, D.C., elites, nor a punch line only to laugh at during "The Daily Show" -- but a critical battle of ideas that requires everyone's participation.

Kleinman riffs on Scotch eggs ($11), replacing the traditional ground sausage with a fine chop of burnt ends, surrounded by a sweet tea gastrique.

I have not set reasonable limits with my children as consistently as my wife, but I try to follow her example. Men are the ones who frequently injure and sometimes kill their children.
