Rebuilding this bunch is impossible and a tad short-sighted. To rebuild, GM Ken Holland would have to do one of two things. Either hed have to look to trade some of the best players in the world (Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk). Or hed have to try to find new homes for players who probably dont hold the same value to other teams. Only Holland and his inner circle know why the Wings only made one move at the trade deadline (D Kyle Quincey). Some theorize that the players that Holland would have been willing to part with had little value on the open market. Well if that wasnt true at the deadline, it certainly wont be true after what we witnessed in the stretch drive and the short playoff run. So if you cant discard, you have to reload.

“Well, it was quick for what it usually is,” Rivers said. “Usually they wait until the day of (the next game), and historically it’s been after shootaround. And you get back to the hotel and you get the information that a guy’s not playing. That was one of the complaints a lot of the guys had, and to me the fact they did it early enough for us — you know, it was after practice, but at least it gave us enough time to prepare for it.”

"One of the misconceptions about us is that we actually go out looking for people abusing children," Soublet said. "In fact, we receive reports of abuse and neglect; we have a hotline for that.

Not yet 14 months removed from elbow reconstruction, Wainwright may have his health, but he's still gaining his feel. The empirical evidence is apparent. His velocity has sat several ticks below where he pitched pre-surgery. His pitches that require extension and finish are the ones that are failing him most often, especially the cutter/slider that two batters launched for homers on Thursday. And his game-to-game consistency isn't there, something that pitching coach Derek Lilliquist – who is familiar with the rehab from Tommy John because he oversaw most of them in the Cardinals' system – will continue to be a test for Wainwright for several months.
His comments came as he was expected to announce this morning a plan for Chrysler that includes a partnership with Fiat SpA and major concessions from the United Auto Workers and some of its creditors. But administration officials Wednesday were actively preparing for the strong possibility that Chrysler would still have to file for bankruptcy to complete its restructuring.
2. An obvious key to the series will be the play of young Blues' defensemen Alex Pietrangelo and Kevin Shattenkirk. Pietrangelo finished 5th in the NHL in scoring among defensemen with 12-39 for 51 points. Shattenkirk was tied for 14th among defensemen in scoring. San Jose has big, physical forwards that can apply uncomfortable pressure on the forecheck. The Blues' offense flows from the blue line. The Hitchcock system relies on the ability of his mobile defensemen to get the puck out of the defensive zone, and into the attacking zone, as quickly as possible. Pietrangelo and Shattenkirk, who play on separate defense pairings, serve as quarterbacks in the Hitchcock offense. The Sharks will try to disrupt that flow by pressuring and pounding Pietrangelo and Shattenkirk. They'll try to make the young D-men uncomfortable, and gradually wear them down over the course of what should be a long series.

Lean health care construction projects are, by their nature, fast-track and don't leave room for redesign. Under such projects, contractors order materials and begin construction while the design is being completed. Redesign can lead directly to cost increases.

Yes, they're great. But that's the problem. Computer games are as addictive as cigarettes. And this is a habit everyone is taking up, not quitting. This is why I dumped my iPod Touch. Am I alone? Maybe. But I don't think so. I know lots of people with horror stories about addiction to immersive games. Someone I know—now, as it happens, a British member of parliament—once sat down to play Civilization, a role-playing game, on a PC one Saturday evening and didn't finish until three o'clock ... Thursday morning. (He stopped when he ran out of cigarettes.) And that was on an old PC. Games on the iPad are more intense than ever. A friend recently showed me some of the serious news apps on his iPad. I noticed that to get to them he first had to "wave" us past several screens of games. Is he really using his iPad to read that article about the Indonesian economy, or is he playing Angry Birds? Hmmm. You make the call.

Those who have stood out on defense in Kelly's eyes are safety Eddie Pleasant, linebackers Michael Clay, Dewitt Stuckey, Boseko Lokombo and Josh Kaddu, and defensive linemen Terrell Turner and Dion Jordan.

I suspect this is one reason why the Bible as literature continues to sustain such imaginative power in the minds of readers, writers, and artists. It is God's "carpe diem" of the world.

With this one-roll wager, he wins if a 7 rolls, but if any other number appears, he loses. The odds are 5-to-1 of a 7 rolling, but the casino will pay only 4-to-1. This gives the house an edge of 16.7%. My guess is your friend either doesn't understand, or care, that the greater the edge, the more money the casino keeps.

With Bill Belichick in charge and with Tom Brady continuing as the NFL's most competent quarterback, the New England Patriots are again the best team in football as another five-month race to the Super Bowl begins this week.

Which, come to think of it, didn’t make the weekend all that different from an ordinary trip to Asbury Park. The most remarkable thing about ATP might have been how seamlessly it blended into the Jersey shore’s premier music city. Asbury is all about history, and so, it turned out, is ATP. The festival was challenging at times, but it was by no means a feast of new sounds. This was, in its way, every bit as crowded with legacy acts as the Blondie-headlined Union County MusicFest, last month. The names at the tops of the bills might have been hipper, but the aim was the same — to connect listeners with revered voices from the past.

The Last Originals Car Club would like to thank the City and People of Pacifica for accepting and attending our car show at the Sea Bowl for the last nine years. This year, just three months before the show, David Szeto, owner of the Sea Bowl, decided to pass on this year's show. His decision was based on the new restaurant opening in June.Why he thinks that bringing 1,500 vistiors and 300 cars to the Sea Bowl would hinder this new business is beyond me. You can thank David for taking away one of Pacifica's yearly free events attended by many.
The lawsuits stem from the arrest of Rene Rebollo Jr., of Pasadena, Calif., a former senior analyst for Countrywide, and Wahid Siddiqi, of Thousand Oaks, Calif.

Hotel Cielo Rojo, San Francisco (a.k.a. San Pancho), $85-$95. Long before there was a Riviera Nayarit, there was the coastline north of Puerto Vallarta, dotted with fishing villages and simple accommodations. This one has been "boutiqued" in an appealing, unpretentious way. Spare but artful rooms feature gleaming white walls, terra cotta floors and painted bathroom tiles. Public spaces are filled with antique fixtures and artwork, and the bar and the Bistro Organico restaurant occupy the ground floor.

The opening segments starring "The Rite of Spring" (1975) offer fascinating comparisons and contrasts to the Joffrey's celebrated version of Nijinsky's original. Here Bausch employs one of her trademarks, elemental scenery, in particular a floor covered in dirt that eventually muddies the dancers. But she explores some of the same primal ugliness of the original, a work about ritual human sacrifice, and, with her deadly, menacing choral arrangements, belies any notion her work isn't breathtaking dance.
A: This is clearly not the problem of the dogs but instead the fault lies with you and that of your kids. As their parent, it's your responsibility to train them to put away their toys and to always have dog toys around for the dogs.

To see whether houses are a good deal in your market, start by checking a list of price-to-rent ratios like the latest one published by Trulia.com. To turn a price-to-rent ratio into a rent yield, simply divide "1" by the ratio. So the New York City area's price-to-rent ratio of 14.5 is equal to a rent yield of 6.9%. (That's not such a high number, especially after subtracting for taxes and maintenance costs, making New York one of a handful of markets where renters shouldn't be in any hurry to buy.)

That was, in part, the basis for its argument that Aramark’s latest bid was not based on a "firm price" as required by the bid specifications, according to the lawsuit. On Feb. 18, Gourmet Dining protested in a letter to Essex County. Less than a month later, Essex rejected Aramark’s bid on the basis that it did not submit a "firm quote" and sent a memorandum of agreement to Gourmet Dining. But on March 26, the county instead rejected all bids and opted to rebid, altering the terms, noting "confusing and misleading" bid wording that created "uncertainty," and adding a provision disqualifying any bidder on the basis of a key executive’s criminal record.

While that might mean slower growth, it also should be more stable in the long term.

Mr. Dempsey's second assumption, that an Israeli attack would only set back Iran's nuclear program for a few years, is also problematic. A successful Israeli strike would undermine both the credibility of the Iranian regime and its influence in the Middle East, which has already been shaken because of Iranian support for the bloody crackdown in Syria by the Assad regime, and it could take a long time for the Islamic leadership of Iran to recover, both economically and politically, from an Israeli attack.

Why ask why? Crank it up. Grade: A-
