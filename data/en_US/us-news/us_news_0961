Be prepared for goosebumps when you slip into a cenote, a pool of blue-green water similar to a sinkhole or quarry pool. The Yucatan Peninsula's thin limestone surface is dotted with cenotes and hidden rivers in caves and dense jungle. Some, like those at Río Secreto have stayed largely unknown for centuries. As the story goes, a campesino found a hole in the ground one day; within a year part of his land had become an eco-park benefiting the local community. Guides lead groups outfitted in plastic helmets and life jackets through dense vegetation, following trails that descend into massive caverns glistening with stalactites and stalagmites and rock formations untouched for 2.5 million years. As they enter the caves, the guides stop at rock altars and describe early Maya beliefs about the underworld. Trails descend into blackness broken by sudden sunbursts illuminating deep pools where visitors can swim in chilly fresh water amid an eerie silence. At Hidden Worlds, the cenote experience gets serious as divers submerge themselves in pitch-dark passes between cave systems. It takes special training and fortitude to explore deep beneath the earth's surface. Those with less-intense curiosity can join snorkel and dive tours that sample the caves and chilly waters.

Beset by financial difficulties, Levy held out as long as he could before agreeing to sell Monticello to the government for $500,000. Although many considered the asking price to be exorbitant, Levy insisted it was half of what he had spent on the estate.

Levy is said to have burst out crying when he signed over the deed to his beloved estate. He died insolvent before his 72nd birthday.

The story starts in upstate New York, then moves to Barcelona, Dublin, New Mexico and Washington. The plot—basically betrayal followed by payback—pits Mallory against the unprincipled security contractor she's been working for, plus all of his shadowy minions. The action isn't nonstop, no matter what the trailer makes you think. Some of the most satisfying stretches come when something is about to happen, as in a very long and ominous tracking shot that follows Mallory down a Dublin sidewalk across the street from St. Stephen's Green. (Mr. Soderbergh, directing from a script by Lem Dobbs, did his own cinematography, which is richly understated when the colors aren't morphing into interludes of grainy black-and-white or baleful ocher.)

A child's mouth and face can be easily injured if the proper precautions are not used while playing sports. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control, more than half of the 7 million sports- and recreation-related injuries that occur each year are suffered by youths as young as 5 years old. Last year, the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation forecast that more than 3 million teeth would be knocked out in youth sporting events- yet, in a survey commissioned by the AAO, 67 percent of parents admitted that their children do not wear a mouth guard during organized sports. The NYSSF says athletes who do not wear mouth guards are 60 times more likely to suffer damage to their teeth. This raises a question: If mouth guards offer a simple and relatively inexpensive solution to help dramatically decrease the risk of oral injuries, why aren't more kids wearing them?
Once he got to Los Angeles, though, Franco saw that acting — or at least, trying to be an actor — wasn’t an impossibility after all. "Half the city was trying to get into the business," he remembers. "One of my dorm mates even got on a series. I realized, ‘Oh, this is something you can actually pursue. There are practical steps you can take.’ " Franco — who, he says, "was very shy, and scared of failure for a long time" — impulsively decided to give it a shot and dropped out of school.

That's what happened to one of Tom Kimmitt's clients. The attorney, a partner with Whiteford, Taylor & Preston, said they'd applied for a permit to construct a building on property in Baltimore County but didn't end up going through with it.

Only three sagebrush sagas have ever won the best picture Oscar, the last being 1992's "Unforgiven."

Also like Holofcener, she can be caustic and funny, too — especially when spurred on by collaborator Stuart Blumberg here. And although Cholodenko happens to be gay and raising a child with her partner, that doesn’t mean she preaches the party line.
Issue 2 only requires that government workers contribute 10 percent to their retirement. That's all. It doesn't change that guaranteed retirement check. Issue 2 just requires government workers to have a little skin in the game. And if they already are contributing 10 percent to their pension, nothing changes.

That's true even of King's new memoir "The Riot Within: My Journey From Rebellion to Redemption" (HarperOne: 245 pp., $25.99), which seeks to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of the riots but never offers a coherent point of view. It's unfair, perhaps, to expect this of King, who was thrust, or thrust himself, into a situation beyond his control. Nonetheless, it's also emblematic of the displacement, the lack of a collective vision, our inability even now to take a broad perspective on the riots and what they mean.
All those salivating in Ann Arbor and East Lansing about Ohio State getting punished by the high priests of hypocrisy (a.k.a. the NCAA punitive police) should do themselves a favor for the sake of their own emotional stability.

I've said this time and again: I think O'Leary is mainly guilty of one thing in this case. He's guilty of being a football coach — a hard-driving, tough-talking football coach. Personally, I don't believe he did anything much different than the macho strength and conditioning coaches at every other big-time school in this country. The difference is a player died under his supervision.
Truth must be absolute. Why do you think they call it the Truth? God gave me the ability to conceptualize absolute truth and it is absurd to suggest that God's gift be for nothing. Plato was right, if absolute truth wasn't a realty, I would not have a conception of it.

Fuller returns to Africa and the story of her unforgettable family in this sequel to "Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight." (August)
Underlying these explorations is the idea that cruelty is linked to rupture, to revelation, even to revolution. That art that seeks discovery will confront surfaces begging to be shattered, platitudes that demand piercing, attitudes that demand adjustment — and cruelty is the mechanism of breakage. Nelson links this both to our contemporary notions of scientific change — new theories are correct, replacing old theories that were wrong — and to Aristotle's ancient idea of catharsis. And if you thought "catharsis" simply meant a purifying release of emotion or tension, Nelson digs into a translation of "Poetics" and parses the sentence, so that the emotions "pity and fear" can either be read as what is purged or what become the catalysts of purging.

Finn, however, is as clueless as ever. But after some deep soul searching, during which he reunites with Rachel, watches "Saturday Night Fever" at Mr. Schu's request and sings "More than a Woman," Finn agrees to move to New York with his fiancee and pursue his dream of...acting? Yeah, I didn't see that one coming either, but I wish him the best of luck. Hopefully his acting is better than his dancing.
Several contributors — including a Florida aerospace company that has contracts with the Defense Department, and a Boston-based construction company that is helping build a Navy base — are taking advantage of a legal gray area created by the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case, which said that independent political expenditures could not be regulated based on who was making them.

Trang led me through the chaos of these streets, turning off Hang Buom into tiny Ta Hien Street. There she pointed out a small shop (No. 2C) — about the size of a walk-in closet in Beverly Hills — where a wizened old woman in traditional dress and a conical straw hat sat eating on the high stoop (a good sign). She beckoned me to sit on a knee-high plastic blue stool at a similarly doll-sized table beneath a small framed picture of Ho Chi Minh. A younger woman sat on another stool above two steaming pots.

After restructuring his contract before last season, Jacobs will have to take another hefty pay cut, especially since the Giants are about $9 million over the salary cap, per ESPN's latest projections.

Carrasco, who gave up a solo homer for Buffalo on Thursday, part of his first rehab appearance there after a spring-training ankle sprain. And there was lefty Garrett Olson, a former first-round pick with a 3.29 ERA for the Bisons.
(On if negotiations with Peyton Hillis are ongoing or if they are going to wait until the end of the season)- "I think with Tom and Matt Thomas who is our negotiator and Kennard McGuire who is his agent, I don't think anybody pushed anybody against the wall on timeline on this. Right now it's kind of quiet, it seems to be kind of quiet, let's let Peyton play, just let him play, let the dust settle a little bit and see what happens. That's where it is."
But fast-forward 34 years and the cost has spiked to $153.4 million a year. That doesn’t even count the higher co-pays, premiums and deductibles that retirees are paying out of their own pockets.

Initial efforts at converting algae to oil required large ponds, where algae were exposed to sunlight to create oil. By replacing sunlight with plants, which have already processed the sun's energy through photosynthesis, Solazyme does not need large ponds. The algae and plants put together in a vat and placed in a dark room will create oil faster and cheaper than ponds, Wolfson said.

In his next-day walk back, the president implied that he was merely talking about the normal "restraint and deference" the courts owe the legislative branch. This concern would be touching if it weren't coming from the leader of a party so deeply devoted to the ultimate judicial usurpation – Roe v. Wade, which struck down the abortion laws of 46 states – that fealty to it is the party's litmus test for service on the Supreme Court. With Obamacare remaking one-sixth of the economy, it would be unusual for the Supreme Court to overturn legislation so broad and sweeping. On the other hand, it is far more unusual to pass such a fundamentally transformative law on such a narrow, partisan basis.

Hollingsworth dotted thick, aged balsamic vinegar on the plate and arranged the blueberries on top of the foie before changing his mind and moving them. Ferreira mimicked Hollingsworth's every move, seconds behind him, so that both dishes were ready to go at the same time. Neither had seen the finished product before. Hollingsworth decided that for the next plate of foie, he wanted to brush the balsamic underneath instead of dot it. One tweak, that was it.
On an annual basis, the economy contracted 0.5%, the first negative reading after seven consecutive quarters of modest annualized growth, the Bank of Spain said in its monthly economic report.

Well, it's not everyone who studies under Andres Segovia and twice was named best flamenco guitarist by Guitar Player magazine.

We are already being forced to think about this a different way. The transportation system of the future is very likely to be different than the one we’ve got today.

Today, in America, the decision to date or marry across racial or ethnic lines generally happens in a social sphere where there is basic equality.

The night after we all learned about Kirk's stroke, I found myself in a supermarket shopping for some sliced ham for my lunches. I remembered I was also running low on toothpaste, so I went to the "drug store" section, and before I realized what I was doing I'd filled my basket with vitamins for people over 50, various stop-smoking aids and Slim Fast. And then I returned to the grocery section and dumped the ham and picked up some turkey instead. It wasn't until I got home that I realized what was going on. I'd been freaked out by Kirk's stroke more than I cared to admit.

Most polyps are found to be benign, meaning that the rapidly dividing cells responsible for the polyp are not moving outside of that growth.

Unfortunately, Aubriot, who was once a very great chef, has become a culinary mercenary, working in restaurants for a few months and then moving on to the next paycheck somewhere else. He doesn't hold up his end at Pasteur. His fishy-smelling sauteed scallops feature mushy tasteless apples, barely cooked, dusty-hard lentils and a parsimony of balsamic reduction. The seared duck breast is a chewy, desiccated mess. His bread pudding is too dense and has almost no custard. His foie gras, featuring a red grape port reduction that tastes like a foie fat-infused berry pie, is incredible, but up against Chef Nyugen's star anise-perfumed pho and curried beef, it's also ridiculously out of context (as if Chipotle started serving sweetbread burritos).

It is a far cry from the fiery orator who during his 2006 presidential run told then-President Vicente Fox to "shut up you chachalaca (noisy bird)" and said "let the devil take your (political) institutions."
