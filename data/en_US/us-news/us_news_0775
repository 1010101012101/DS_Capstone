Ottavino has a live arm, the ability to operate in the mid-90s mph with his fastball, and he has a breaking ball that he can use effectively. Since the major-league staff took a long look him as a reliever during spring training in 2009, the idea has kicked around the organization that maybe the key to unlocking Ottavino's potential was to move him to the bullpen.

Why does shaking make a drink cloudy? Cocktail expert Gary Regan says in "The Joy of Mixology" that a shaken drink is colder, so some compounds in the vermouth may emerge from solution and form tiny droplets, a phenomenon known as chill haze.

For the record, Regan thinks there is nothing wrong with a cloudy martini except for its appearance.

Plump never found a more defining moment than his last shot — and that was in high school. He played for Indiana's Butler University. Then, in 1958, he turned down the National Basketball Association to play in the National Industrial Basketball League, featuring teams sponsored by Caterpillar Inc., Safeway Inc. and other corporate giants. If he'd signed with an NBA team, he'd have made $4,000 a year. Instead, he signed with the Phillips 66ers for $6,200.

Kelsey Grammer has filed papers for primary physical custody of his two daughters with ex-wife and "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Camille Grammer, and while we question the parenting philosophy of any woman who signs on to star in a "Real Housewives" franchise, she can't be that much worse than a guy who cheats on his wife, moves clear across the country from his family, and rushes the divorce so he can marry his mistress. I hope I'm not wrong.

Now, a year later after I first reviewed Benu, Lee's food has become even more refined. He's sharpened his point of view, and the Asian side of the menu emerges even more strongly.

Generally, the larger the roast, the lower you'll want to maintain the heat level for gentle, leisurely cooking. Since others have laid down the laws of grilling in manuals much more comprehensive and impassioned than this simple lesson on indirect heat, I'll avoid discussions of the purity of hardwood versus the democracy of briquettes versus the power of gas.

Why denial? House Speaker Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone, Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, and the governor could have insisted, individually or collectively, that any tax increase the Legislature passed be referred to voters. It's not like voters didn't have skin in the game on the two tax measures that were passed. Almost a quarter-million Oregonians are already out of work today, and economists -- some who work for the legislative leadership -- have estimated that the permanent tax increases on corporations and high-income earners will lead to the loss of more jobs. Why not let voters decide? It's their future. But Hunt, Courtney and Kulongoski seem to think they know better.

And now, a body of interesting, if anecdotal, writings about the effect of the Internet on human thinking has begun to pop up. And - surprise, surprise - it explores the idea that people aren't setting aside time to think very deeply.
"Footnote" speaks volumes. Intensely specific in story yet wide-ranging in themes, with a tone that turns on a dime from comic absurdity to close to tragedy, this is brainy, bravura filmmaking of the highest level, a motion picture that is as difficult to pigeonhole as it is a pleasure to enjoy.

Barbara's Bookstore in the heart of the University of Illinois at Chicago is easily identifiable by the window drawings of authors and their quotes about reading. It caters to UIC students with comfy couches, tables and a big bargain section. Barbara's is an independent chain with six Chicago-area locations, plus six in O'Hare International Airport and one in Boston.

Challenging terrain: Squaw Valley in North Lake Tahoe. The Palisades are the testing ground for the best skiers around. People talk about KT-22 and Headwall with a reverence rarely seen in any sport.

The complexity lies in the fact that Palestinian moderates, like Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, see their future not in grand gestures but in day-to-day investment in the Palestinian people: infrastructure, education, business. Of course, they continue to demand justice from the Israelis, especially the end of the occupation. But at the same time, they look for seemingly insignificant moves that actually make a difference, like the right to create banks.

You can trade a combo of those 2nd rounders to move UP in THIS draft, but not out of this draft.
Otherwise, Indianapolis has sufficient strengths. This, in truth, is the only NFL team wise enough to play offense correctly without a fullback. In modern football, fullbacks are outdated and unneeded — an encumbrance to offense, actually — and somebody in Indianapolis must realize that. But in one-back football, of the two ways to go (two tight ends or three wide receivers), the Colts rely too frequently on an extra tight end, shortchanging their passing game.

If you book at most Holiday Inn Express hotels around the country, you end up in a rectangular box suitable for a quick night's sleep before heading somewhere else. In Santa Barbara, the Holiday Inn Express is on the National Register of Historic Places. It's the resuscitated Hotel Virginia, built in 1917, featuring small but cozy rooms with exposed brick walls. The lobby has a tiled fountain, and the sidewalk out front is painted a rusty orange to match the Southwestern earth tones that now decorate the landmark. Unfortunately, the hotel gained some buzz (a cool Holiday Inn Express!) and prices are up.

I was worried for Joshua Ledet when they announced that he was doing "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," an upbeat rockabilly throwback that demands more sexuality and camp than Joshua has ever shown. And at first it did seem on the solid side of unexceptional.

But he is a hunter, and such charcuterie is not a far leap from the medium-rare venison or a side of pheasant breast with which he is familiar. He, however, has little reference for hearty Italian grains such as farro, studded with dried punchy sweet mulberry and tangy wild rhubarb. And yet, the charcuterie earned his trust, and he declared Bread and Wine one of the best restaurants to which he'd ever been. I'd hoped for a touch more acid, a bit more salt.

This is Bruich's first full-time gig in a restaurant and it remains to be seen how he will handle the pressure, the commotion, the madness and the magnitude of the nightly grind in a professional kitchen. If I have concerns about this chef, they center on whether he has put in the time and done the reps necessary to pull off cooking under any conditions. As in art, literature or gourmet cooking, a trailblazer must understand the past before he can create a new future.
Based on 2010 Census figures of population shifts, the legislatures in most states will draw political district boundaries for the U.S. House, often subject to a veto from the governor.

But Heyward struggled in his second season. He hurt his shoulder in March, developed bad habits at the plate and never really got on track.

Keller fitted some of the best items on the Bizou menu, such as the tempura fried green beans ($6), into the new format. This dish is my litmus test by which all other frito misto is judged. The beans are coated in a puffy batter that crunches like corn flakes, releasing a gush of steam, yielding to tender green beans that are sweet and mild. She also kept the beef cheeks ($13) -- she was one of the first in the city to offer this once-overlooked cut of meat -- which are slowly braised to release the creamy gelatinous rivulets laced throughout the meat. She counters the richness with

Rather than merely tightening credit, the challenge is to recalibrate the country's access to credit so that more responsibility for making good loans lies with lenders and so that the burden is not almost entirely on would-be borrowers. Recalibrating would mean returning to the responsible use of underwriting that is transparent and allows for a higher debt-to-income ratio with a higher down payment. It would allow people with past credit problems to qualify for loans that do not expose them to excessive risks and that start off with manageable mortgage payments relative to their incomes.

I'm not really making an argument against spontaneous prayer-in fact sometimes the most meaningful prayers aren't even formed by words at all, but are about listening with depth and intensity, and knowing that you are in touch with the great "I am" in a way that goes entirely beyond words. However, praying with the Psalms is such an ancient and enduring practice of the Church that I think we need to be very careful not to replace or supplant it, although of course we can faithfully supplement it with other prayer practices.

In “Die Walküre” (“The Valkyrie”)—the second installment of the “Ring Cycle”—we begin to see the conflicts that lead directly to the final “twilight of the gods.” The opera calls on the orchestra and singers equally to tell its story—all the more reason for concern that Metropolitan Opera music director James Levine would be unable to conduct the premiere of Robert Lepage’s new production on Friday.

Hyper-fresh cuts of fish are used in the daily sushi and sashimi specials and the wonderfully artistic and inventive rolls. There's a roll named after nearly every state of the union. Some fit, like the Oregon roll with salmon and crab, or the Florida with tuna, yellowtail and a citrusy burst of lemon zest.

The quack who treated you isn't our problem. Most medical care on cruise ships is perfectly adequate. But just in case it isn't, cruise lines have a clause that say they aren't responsible for the malpractice of the ship's doctors. Have a look at paragraph 13 of Princess' passage contract: "Doctors, nurses or other medical or service personnel work directly for Passenger and shall not be considered to be acting under the control or supervision of Carrier, since Carrier is not a medical provider. Similarly, and without limitation, all spa personnel, photographers, instructors, guest lecturers and entertainers and other service personnel shall be considered independent contractors who work directly for the Passenger." In other words, when a doctor's negligence leads to the death of a family member, the cruise line is off the hook.
