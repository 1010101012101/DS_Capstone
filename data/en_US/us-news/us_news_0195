Our secondary sports — baseball and basketball — are popular on every continent on the planet, but the appeal of American football is limited mostly to Americans. Perhaps this is why we like it?

"The Whole Love" is the strongest effort from these guys since 1999's "Summerteeth"; maybe even their best yet.

Most recently I have teetered on the edge of the index over the wearing of shorts, the acceptability of which turns out to be "big" among, ahem, a certain group of us out there. I own two pairs of shorts, black and grey, from T by Alexander Wang. Purchased at my very favorite place, TheOutnet.com, they are baggy, pocketed and made of sweatshirt fabric. They rest halfway up my thigh and I wear them with leggings underneath and a baggy sweater on top. Do I consider this to be dignified and AA? As it happens, I do. Would I leave the house bare-legged in short, fitted shorts? Only if I were living in Goa and never planned to require anyone to consider me credible again. Do I consider short shorts to be wearable in the context of work and play? Yes, but seriously (and here's an edict), if you are 40-plus, have great legs and are intent on wearing shorts to do business in, then said shorts need to be part of a shorts suit—as in those sent down the runway by the likes of Jil Sander, Givenchy (though I fear these were too, too short and slinky for the dignity index) and Proenza Schouler. Even then, I would be wearing them with a pair of footless tights and some flats or three-inch heels at most.
Obama's claims about the Republican fiscal plan were similarly overwrought. Like Obama, the Republicans want to increase spending, just not by quite as much. Sadly, there's nothing radical about that.

A: My style of dress has been described as a fusion of Eddie Bauer and early 20th Century hobo. I wear pants, begrudgingly, but feel I should be able to tromp around in my bathrobe. I am suit-averse and shall remains so, though they do force me at gunpoint to wear a sport coat when I’m on TV. (I wish they made those things sleeveless, and in terry cloth.)

Anthony Capone has been the team’s best hitter not named Andrew Velazquez and he came up big again Sunday night with a game-winning sacrifice fly in a wild win over St. Raymond at Richmond County Bank Ballpark on Staten Island.

Johnston has been impressed by the strides 20-year-old center Cam Reid has made since leaving St. Cloud State University in early-January to play for the Winterhawks. "No matter where you come from, no matter what your age, it takes a player a little while to adjust to the league and they style of play and your new teammates," Johnston said. "Cam got off to a good start in his first 10-12 days, then I thought it took him another month to settle in and start to play his best hockey. And then lately, I've just seen him take it to a new level. He's been excellent."

Trevor Rosenthal: Coming in I didn't really know what to expect. I was going to try and do my best to make the most of it. I wanted to get around the guys, and I knew that I would be in uncomfortable positions to where here were guys I always looked up to and now I was going to be there with them. I was going to try and make myself as open to them as possible. It turns out, they were even more open. That made it real easy to pick their brains and connect with them on a lot of things, just on the field stuff, and as far as the coaching staff and front office – everyone has been the same way. They've been open to talk about what they're thinking. They've been open to my questions. They've given me good answers.

At 62, Drake appears to be a good choice to take on the day-to-day management of the city. He is smart, energetic and well-connected with local and regional officials. Certainly, it will take an adjustment on his part to go from a strong-mayor structure in Beaverton where he functioned as chief executive of a nearly 500-person workforce to a situation where he reports to the city council and oversees a city staff of about 50. In that regard, his recent work in Tillamook and Carlton should serve him well.

So how does Kidd's breakout Game 1 performance change the series? The Blazers can't abandon the plan to stop Nowitzki. And if they guard Kidd too closely, he'll return to what he does best and create open looks for his teammates.

Even the skates are treacherous.

The impact of poor planning can be very expensive to the taxpayers. One mindset that was expressed at last month’s meeting was on the generation of taxes. The resident said that if the township needed a figure like $1 million and there were 100 equal properties, each property owner would pay $10,000 to give the township the funds. However, if there were 200 equal properties then each would only be responsible for the amount of $5,000. Even though it sounds logical, it is wrong in so many ways.

An appetizer called Just Avocado is a cool idea. A halved avocado is left intact but sliced for easy removal and accompanied by a salad of heirloom tomatoes and a cilantro-lime salsa and fresh, crispy masa chips.. The same goes for a dish of edamame that the menu says is finished with a shiitake mushroom sauce. That touch doesn't take. The pods don't take on the flavor of the sauce they're swimming in.

Dr. Cheng began his research on huang qin tang about a dozen years ago when he sought a better way of dealing with the chemotherapy's side effects. A variety of medications are currently used to treat these symptoms, but with varying success. A more effective technique could improve patients' quality of life and possibly allow them to tolerate a larger dose of chemo, which might speed up their course of treatment, he says.

Time is critical in education. No time to goof off.
Around the time kids are 3 or 4, they start to enjoy books that tell stories.

Rocchio: I became one because I really love the sport (of basketball) and realized I most likely won't have a future playing it. It's a great opportunity to just be able to be around the game and get connections along the way. It also gives me experience for college managing, which I plan to do.
I suppose my greatest enemy in all this was expectation. My whole life my brain has absorbed useless information the way Jim Edmonds would absorb fly balls.

It’s the rare frontman who would relinquish that role, and that’s another sign that Perdomo is after something bigger than the standard mook yammering away in a rock band. His seriousness can be tiring, and there are times on “War Paint” when you’ll want to slap a sense of humor into him. But by adding a literary dimension to emo-pop storytelling, the Dangerous Summer has managed to realize the ambitions of many of its heroes and predecessors.

Sweeney, Oliver and Greenwald also stressed that, contrary to the governor’s public comments, arbitration is not one of the top factors in the state’s highest-in-the-nation property taxes. That culprit, they said, is largely the big number of redundant governments and public workers. So, they said, they are declaring war on home rule and will push an aggressive agenda of town consolidation and shared services among municipalities.

Food vetoes also can come down from other kids in the family. Casey Newman of North Portland was happy to receive salmon casserole and seaweed soup, but her older daughter, Sairshe, was less enthused. "The nicest thought was a meal that included mac-and-cheese for my 3-year-old. She often didn't like the food that people brought so we'd end up making her something else. It was nice to not have to do that, and to have her thought of so nicely."
Granted, the actual trade can't be executed until March 13, the start of the free agency and training period. But you always can agree to terms before that - or at least get close to that - which is what the Rams would like to do before free agents hit the market. Or before teams have much of a chance to kick the tires on Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning.

It says Kmiec's "unconventional approach" to being ambassador has upset State Department officials, "especially over his reluctance to accept their guidance and instructions." The ambassador has rebuffed their suggestions because he believes he was given a special mandate to promote Obama's interfaith initiatives, even as embassy staff must "spend an inordinate amount of time reviewing his writings, speeches and other initiatives."

The case, known as the Turner case for the name of the original parent plaintiff, has been weighing over St. Louis since the summer of 2010.

Richard F. Ross and Carolyn S. Ross, as trustees of the Ross Revocable Trust, purchased a 6,176-square-foot home with pool built in 1998 at the gated community of La Place Du Sommet in Paradise Valley. Attorney Rick Ross is a partner at SNR Denton in Phoenix. He chairs the hotels and leisure practice. The home was sold by Dr. Marshall Strome, a board-certified otolaryngologist with a special interest in head and neck cancer surgery. In 1998, Strome performed what was cited as the world's first total human laryngeal transplant. In 2005, he performed the first robotic laser excision of a laryngeal malignancy.

The world premiere of Du Yun's "Kraken" brought more surprises. The young Shanghai-born composer is this season's winner of the DSO's Elaine Lebenbom prize for women composers. "Kraken," named for a mythological sea serpent, turned out to be an abstract tone poem, a series of feverish hallucinations scored for a large orchestra in which sonority, texture and dynamics trumped melody and harmony as organizing principles. Rhythm was expressed more in terms of pulsation than a steady beat.
Strong drink inspires loud song, and thus was born the custom of wassailing in the sense of caroling from door to door.
The grass is thigh high. Here is a striped golf ball, forgotten and mud-dimpled, a Top Flite XL Super Range. Sold by the bucket to practicing duffers, smacked into oblivion, retrieved and sold again. Deep in the weeds are a pair of toppled yardage signs, 100 and 125. Directly east from the covered hitting area, about pitching wedge distance out, rainwater finds a depression and forms a knee-deep pond 50 feet across. A dozen ducks rise and fly south in a burst of disturbed water, angry quacks and whirring wings. Narrow animal trails crisscross the property; neighbors think coyotes patrol it.

To fix the banking sector, should we rely more on government regulation and oversight or let the market figure it out? Tougher rules or more capitalism? Right now, we have the worst of both worlds. We have a purportedly capitalistic system with a lot of rules that are not strictly enforced, and when things go wrong, the government steps in to protect banks from the market consequences of their own worst decisions. To me, that's not capitalism.

At Augusta, there is none braver, none bolder than Mickelson. On Thursday, he was 4-over through 10 holes, coming off a triple bogey, and the week could have been lost. Instead, he salvaged it, grinding out a 74. When putts didn't fall on the front side Saturday, he shrugged it off, and used birdies at 10 and 12 to pull within two of the lead.

Workforce reductions have become an unfortunate component of the business landscape. The most recent recession was the worst since the Great Depression. Announced job cuts in 2008 and 2009 totaled nearly 2.5 million, according to planned layoffs tracked by our firm. Private sector payrolls shrank by nearly 8.9 million jobs from February 2008 through February 2010, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is more than the approximately 7 million jobs combined lost in the previous three recessions (1981-82, 1990-91 and 2001).

Obama's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, sought to make clear that the "White House Communications Agency," which has now been implicated by the widening scandal, is a military unit and not a White House one.

"I don't want to say it's 'easier' to play in the playoffs, but I think it is easier," Hitchcock said. "You're not traveling as much, you know the opponent, you get lots of rest. The stress and everything is there, but I think it's the travel that kicks you. Plus, they get a bead on the shooters. So I don't think it's the same as the regular season."
"In high school baseball, if you don't put runners on base, you'll win a lot of games," Moad said. "That's been a problem for us recently - we've been making a lot of errors and our pitchers have been walking a lot of guys.

At the county committee meeting, the power blinks off twice. In the audience, resident Maggie Runyan leans over and stage-whispers, "Didn't pay the bill."
A stronger euro helped the market. The euro rose after a bond offering by Spain's government drew solid demand. Traders have been concerned that European countries like Spain with high debt loads would have trouble raising money because of worries about defaults. A stronger euro is seen as a sign of confidence in Europe's ability to cut its debt without jeopardizing an economic rebound. The euro climbed to $1.2396, up more than 5 cents from the four-year low it reached last week.
"He’s one of those (players) that we need to get a lot of fitness work done," Spencer said. "Since we made the bid to Tolima, he wasn’t training with the first group and (he) lost a little bit of fitness. The quicker we get him back into camp, the better."

The zoo said it raised more than $44,000 in online donations to help cover the costs of at least $120,000 to care for the animals.
Under the legislation, a former lawmaker also could opt out of the higher pension. It would apply to lawmakers who were in the legislature before August 1994 and then took a different government job with a sweeter paycheck. A 1994 law prevents lawmakers hired after that date from boosting their state pensions when they leave the General Assembly for higher-paying government jobs.

Grohl probably wouldn’t mind if everybody forgot that he was a member of Nirvana. It would be liberating for him to shake free of the baggage and crank up the volume like any other arena rock traditionalist. But the world will not forget. It was Grohl’s thunderous introductory fill on "Smells Like Teen Spirit" that roused mainstream rock from a decade-long slumber; Grohl who smashed the lid down on "Heart-Shaped Box." Those were transformative moments.
Johnson's draft stock could have fallen due to his medical history. At Virginia, he was diagnosed with sickle-cell trait, a genetic disorder that can affect blood hemoglobin and cause anemia during extreme physical exertion. Before the 2011 season, London said he thought Johnson's condition affected his energy level during games. In a phone interview this week, though, London said he didn't believe Johnson's sickle-cell trait was a major issue during his career.
NASA is likely to be involved in additional scientific revelations. Last November, the space agency launched the Mars Science Laboratory, a spacecraft whose lander is equipped with two cameras that will serve as the rover's "eyes."

St. Louis, however, bucked the trend, according to RealtyTrac. The 17-county metro area reported a 3.2 percent decline from the fourth quarter, and a 15.7 percent drop from the same quarter last year, the latest sign that foreclosures may have peaked here.
In a 1998 study published in Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, Bargar reported that hip implants fit better overall in 63 people who were operated on by Robodoc than in 64 patients who had implants fit by hand.

Leaders from opposite sides of the divisive debate said they supported the outcome -- or at least suggested they probably could live with it.

'DO WHAT YOU LOVE'
Back when Snow White sang, "Someday my prince will come," waiting on a prince -- and raising his babies afterward -- constituted pretty much a woman's entire range of options. Seventy-five years later, women have options their grandmothers could scarcely have dreamt. So is it asking too much that we relegate this tired narrative to the junk heap where it belongs?

Under the deal, Phoenix will give back to the developer half of the sales taxes collected at CityNorth for 11 years and three months, or $97.4 million, whichever comes first. In return, developers agreed to construct 3,180 free parking spaces, including 200 for park-and-ride use.
Democrats, who control the Legislature, have proposed their own changes to the pension system to model it after private sector funds. They would create joint labor/management boards to administer the system; force employees to pay more into the system if its fiscal health declines; roll back the pension boost or make employees pay more; eliminate cost of living adjustments for new and recent hires, and force veteran workers to pay more for them.

Just as every little hole and crack that allows air in to the attic needs to be sealed off, so does this relatively large opening. Thankfully, the fix for this situation is very simple; just cap the end of the pipe. This can be done pretty much any way you see fit - I've seen it done with both electrical tape and duct tape, and it works fine. If you have a newer home, this is just one more reason to break the seal on your attic access panel.

From the list of titles World Book Night offers, Fitzpatrick-Bjorn chose "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card, a high-action science-fiction book that she said appeals to reluctant readers. She teamed up with other librarians, who will all give their books to youths at the Donald E. Long Home.
"We went through the area. We made an assessment. We came to the conclusion that the road was safe to travel and that is when we opened the road up," Highway patrol spokesman Lt.

Economies across the eurozone are contracting as governments enact austerity measures -- spending cuts and higher taxes -- to reduce their budget deficits and slow the growth of their debts. Eight eurozone countries -- including Greece, Spain and the Netherlands -- have seen their economies shrink for two straight quarters or more, the common definition of a recession.

At the time, Scott suggested the board take up the idea again in 18 months, when the new funding biennium has kicked in and the district has a better sense of its enrollment growth. A local option levy, unlike a bond, can be spent on district operations. It is not limited to construction.
Ryan Braun connected against Sean Marshall in the bottom of the ninth, trimming the Reds' lead to one with his 10th homer.

Sundown was an hour away, but already it was hard to find a place on the grassy knoll above the river. Middle-aged couples, parents maneuvering strollers down a wide stairway, young lovers and teens traveling in packs staked out their ground and waited for the summer's biggest event to begin.

The preparatory study offers a rare glimpse into Cezanne's creative process. The figure in the painting is that of Paulin Paulet, a gardener on Cezanne's estate near Aix en Provence, France. It was last displayed at a New York gallery in 1953.
You ask for a "clear signal" from Mr. Fletcher to assure you that he is a man of "principle." It's an unfortunate reality that almost all elections are won by the candidate who spends the most money, so why should your support of any candidate be contingent upon their excluding financial support from one of the area's major interest groups? Is the business community with the U-T as its surrogate spokesperson so concerned about big bad labor that they want to further limit what the Supreme Court has defined as speech?
This is why the church opposes same-sex marriage. It has nothing to do with denying anyone their civil rights. It has everything to do with saving an institution which dates back to the beginning of the human race.
After the defensive error to begin the seventh inning, Lave got the next batter, Gunner Pollman, on a line drive that sent Bafaro to the center-field wall. The next batter, Josh Holmes, popped out to center for the second out.

Antelo, who was born in Spain and who has owned this restaurant for more than a decade, is also a purist about freshness — the nearby Lincoln Tunnel allows him the luxury of deliveries sometimes twice a day from the same purveyor, if needed. Still, he’s frugal about what he orders. Customers who come in for something specific have learned to reserve their dinner when they reserve their table; otherwise it might be gone before you get here.

On the court, the Kings rookie point guard has moved from the last pick in the 2011 NBA draft to a key role in the team's starting lineup. In the community he's creating a different buzz as he explores a broader role, showing up at the City Council for a critical vote on a proposed new arena or at a school as a role model for at-risk students.
Asked about the email after he signed the bill, Kasich responded: "Do you have any idea the politics that have been used to club me over the head and Republicans over the head?" I think there's nothing inappropriate to the fact of letting people know what we've done, and if people want to help us, that's great. Period, exclamation point."
Alderman Lyda Krewson, D-28th Ward, who championed the bill in the city, feels the same way.
In 2010, there were six deals, including one in the first round that saw Philly move from No. 24 to No. 13 and take Michigan defensive end Brandon Graham.

A month ago, he and the two other members of his team set up a listening post on a hill overlooking a town in northern Helmand Province. Other Marines were about to enter the town, and Chambers and his team intended to monitor local radio traffic.
Smith has repeated several times this offseason his desire for the Chargers to be "dominating" and "dictating" on that side of the ball, lamenting their league-worst performance on third down in 2011.

DeCourcy: As is the case when there’s a coach opening, I believe there’s only one ideal candidate for each job. I believe if you have a list instead of a target you’re only one step up from the school that puts together a search committee.
This was the second birthday for the former Egyptian president while in detention. Mubarak is on trial on charges of complicity in the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 18-day popular uprising that ousted him from power in February 2011.

Another .38-caliber pistol, seized last year when authorities captured suspected drug lord Alfredo Beltran Leyva, is adorned with emeralds, an engraving of revolutionary leader Francisco "Pancho" Villa and a proverb: "I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees."

At the end of the evening, the Tallahassee Quarterback Club offered honorary lifetime member status to Ward, making him one of a select group of people to enjoy the honor. Bowden is another honorary lifetime member as a result of his work with as FSU's coach for 34 seasons before his turbulent departure at the end of the 2009 season.
The laws of economics suggest that increasing the tax for a given product, particularly for a discretionary purchase like bottled beverages, will reduce sales. Members of the City Council need to weigh that as they consider Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's bottle tax proposal. But they also need to consider the economic drain on the city caused by its dilapidated, outmoded school facilities. Which is more likely to hold the city back? The beverage industry warns that the bottle tax could send some city residents across the county line to shop for groceries. The condition of the schools sends them across the border for good.
The addresses listed for the companies — which included Archimedes Home Buyers, First Jersey Real Estate, Father and Son Computer Repair and Jersey City Computer Repair — were either Parera’s apartment, post office boxes or empty office space. It is unclear if they had any clients.

As for the boosters, Duyck said he and Spiesschaert are scheduled to meet in coming days in an attempt to smooth out long-standing differences.
Jackie's got a gun: Jacqueline Laurita's daughter Ashley comes home and apologizes to Jacqueline for flipping out on her the last time she visited. Tears. Jacqueline wants Ashley to see a life coach. "I think the idea of paying someone to tell me about myself is dumb," says Ashley, who has her own plan, er, "plan": two semesters of community college, then transferring "somewhere." When Jacqueline and husband Chris touch base later about Ashley, he makes it clear he doesn't really trust Ashley's boyfriend and makes veiled threats about going after him with what's in the safe. What's in the safe? Why, a rifle and a couple of guns, plus plenty of ammo including a Rambo-style bandolier. You know, in case a riot breaks at the Willowbrook Mall and the unwashed masses going wilding in the streets of Franklin Lakes.

Lack of top speed separates him from the top receivers. Sanu is mostly perceived as a possession receiver. He has played almost exclusively from the slot. He was a high school quarterback who was used extensively in the Wildcat at Rutgers. He has top intangibles and should be a locker-room asset.

This fuel-injected testosterone torrent started with "The Fast and the Furious" in 2001, with Paul Walker racing Vin Diesel through Los Angeles. Next came "2 Fast 2 Furious." Diesel was gone but Walker was back, with an assist from Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris. Everything got kind of weird in No. 3, "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift," with the original folks pretty much stepping aside. Dropping the "Thes" and the "and," the series returned to Los Angeles in 2009 with "Fast & Furious." I guess they ran out of titles.

Technically speaking, the deal let him transfer his credits from the Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund to the Sheriff's Law Enforcement Personnel program of the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund. The bottom line? Instead of two pensions adding up to $45,000 a year, Sheahan got one worth $77,000. That's a bump of more than $30,000 a year.
Norman's conservative, law-and-order outlook clashed with the militantly anti-war, anti-authoritarian politics of groups like the Students for a Democratic Society. He showed up at their gatherings, trolling for information and snapping pictures until he was tossed out.

Arda: Unfortunately I'm not looking forward to this match, which is a shame because I'm really looking forward to what can come from the Divas division in the next few months. Beth Phoenix is a fantastic leader for the division, particularly with her in-ring work, Natalya is right up there in the same category, AJ has been hitting home runs with her work alongside Daniel Bryan, Eve is finding her niche as a conniving "Hoeski," a highly underrated Layla is set to return, a highly anticipated Kharma is waiting in the wings, Kelly Kelly is the perfect diva foil for a Beth Phoenix type and Tamina Snuka has lineage. Unfortunately right now, there is a lot of "potential" and not enough "kinetic," including in this match. Maria Menounos, though, will work very hard, I bet, considering that she's a big WWE fan and is familiar with a WWE ring. Maria and Kelly Kelly score the win.
Buying from the Russians requires a congressional exemption from national-security laws that ban high-tech commerce with Russia. NASA first obtained a waiver in 2008 — after fierce debate — and has begun efforts to extend it past its mid-2016 expiration.

I would be all for doing away with the death penalty if opponents of the death penalty would be willing to let the likes of Harris, Timmendequas and Crockam live with them and feed and support them for the rest of their lives. Until that happens, they shouldn’t be writing letters saying I and a lot of other New Jersey citizens approve of Connecticut and other states abolishing the death penalty.

Forty years ago, when gas prices were much lower and my metabolism was much higher, it was no big deal to hop in the car and head out for a box of late-night doughnuts on a whim. One of our favorite destinations was Mister Donut on Olive Street Road, a little glass box of a building that I still can't drive past without some longing. We also had Dynasty Donuts on Brentwood, The Donut Hole on Tesson Ferry, and a prototypical old German bakery at Gravois and Loughborough, whose name has totally escaped me. A friend of mine worked there for a while long ago, and we used to go in through the back door for leftover freebies. Their specialties included sugar-coated jelly donuts that weighed about three pounds apiece.

Then he's flying home to be with the missus, and I'm coming in to do a bunch of scenes with Ruffalo. I think everybody really bought into the spirit of the thing."

The curd prepared, I started to make the cheese. With a fine-mesh sieve, I lifted the curds from the whey and poured them into two cheesecloth-lined, perforated plastic molds that I had salvaged from some Angelo & Franco ricotta containers and set the molds on a rack in my oval roasting casserole. I leveled them off, covered them with wax paper and left them to sit for a day at 72 degrees (letting Santa Monica's mild climate control the temperature for me).
As we drove on, Karma skillfully navigated our air-conditioned car on the cliff-hugging East West Highway that roller-coasters from verdant valleys to high mountain passes (several more than 10,000 feet). He seemed unfazed by whatever we encountered, whether it was a stalled truck with the words "Good Luck" cheerfully painted on one side, a patch of relentless rain and mud or a monkey running across the road. For hours I saw only natural beauty and the occasional sign of human life — a wooden prayer wheel powered by a roadside waterfall, prayer flags waving from tree branches and a chorten (a stupa-like temple) in the middle of a roundabout.

Two museums in downtown Mesa provide indoor opportunities for a similar dose of edu-tainment. The Arizona Museum of Natural History is packed with kid-friendly attractions: large model dinosaurs, rocks, gold panning and cell-house blocks from early prisons. The colorful Arizona Museum for Youth (ages 1-12) doesn't look particularly western, but a friendly greeter tells me that enough people have tried to bring in their firearms that the museum provides a locker where they can be checked.
I felt my cleat come out of the grass and was happy it didnt get stuck, Laird said. That kept the twisting action from becoming more severe and doing more damage.
As a venerable local institution, the Muny ranks way up on the list, and it predates almost all of us.

first, my heart goes out to the people in Washington County who are currently struggling with the many challenges of poverty. It is extremely difficult and Governor Kitzhaber and I are taking this issue seriously. Washington County makes the point that poverty is not just confined to out of the way places. Poverty is a problem all across the state and even exists side by side with economic development success stories like Intel and Nike. We are all in this together and need to pull together to help all Oregonians prosper.

Sept. 11, 2001: Terrorists attack New York and Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. The events put immigration under a microscope because the attackers were foreigners, and change the way many politicians and Americans view immigration. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox goes so far as to say that if it were not for the attacks, Congress would have passed reform legislation that benefited Mexican emigration to America.
"It was a pretty stress-free round," said Miller, who had 13 two-putt greens. "For most of the day I just got the ball on the green, lagged it up there and two-putted."

"It's no secret Matt's not shooting the ball well," Lakers coach Mike Brown said. "I think he's had some good looks. He's shot better from the line, especially toward the end of the year he shot the ball really well. Right now he's not shooting it well. He's working at it. He goes in, he stays late. He stayed after Game 2 to shoot. If a guy is doing that and the guy has been there for us the entire year, then if he's open, he's got to shoot it."
The "Real Housewives of New Jersey", and one Real Offspring in particular, continue to astound with a toxic mixture of obliviousness, self-righteousness and massive entitlement. Two cases in point: Teresa Giudice making a play for diamonds for her tenth anniversary mere weeks after filing for bankruptcy, and Ashley Holmes pitching a fit because her parents won't like, get over the fact that she assaulted Danielle Staub. I mean, it was just her hair extensions! It wasn't, like, her actual hair!
OK, it's just a movie, and Eastwood shot the guy anyway. I won't push the metaphors any further. Still, finding some creative solutions to raise money and help students and teachers this spring may require a little Western-style toughness.

Before the advent of the euro, Germany's mark was Switzerland's main point of reference—including a period in the 1970s when the Swiss National Bank pegged the franc against the mark to rein in a surge in the Swiss currency. Today, as in the 1970s, Germany is Switzerland's largest trading partner, so a new Deutsche mark could in theory substitute for the euro, according to this person, although the bank is considering other scenarios, such as the formation of more than one currency bloc within Europe.

The izakaya dishes practically cry out for beer, and Nobuo offers several exceptional imports. Expand your horizons with Iwate Kura Oyster Stout ($11), brewed with oyster shells, or Coedo Beniaka ($8.50), a sweet potato lager. I particularly liked the Ozeno Yukidoke ($11), an in-your-face IPA. If these sound too extreme, you can safely retreat to a Sapporo draft ($4).
Shortly afterward, Obama chastised Republicans for their "sanctimony" in claiming that only they had the mettle to make tough choices in a tight budget year. And he called for "responsible budgeting."

First, as bizarre as it feels to be saying this in 2012, Romney deserves credit for hiring someone who is openly gay. This ought to be a no-brainer, except that we are talking about the Republican Party, which is more comfortable with gay supporters in the closet than out.
"We're making a blood vessel where there wasn't one," says Christopher Breuer, the Yale pediatric surgeon who led the 12-hour procedure to implant the device. "We're inducing regeneration."
Part of their discomfort appears to stem from a feeling that being gay is a "choice" that individuals make, rather than a condition over which one has no control, such as the color of one's skin. Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that sexual orientation is no more a matter of individual choice than race; people are born hard-wired with a propensity to be heterosexual or homosexual, and there is nothing they can do to change it.
Which proves that only a man of such depth and substance can reduce the historic feat of playing two professional sports to a Wikipedia footnote.

Q. Do a lot of seniors have dentures?
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum's decision today to drop out of the presidential race leaves GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney with a clear path to his party's nomination but a rocky one to an eventual contest with President Barack Obama in the fall. Mr. Santorum, largely viewed as a fringe candidate until his surprising surge in the Iowa caucuses, has provided Mr. Romney with a much stiffer than expected challenge, and overcoming a strong competitor in the primaries has given the former Massachusetts governor an invaluable taste of the kind of battle he will face in the fall. But that benefit may be outweighed by the extent to which Mr. Santorum pulled Mr. Romney off of the economic message that had been central to his campaign and into social issues that play well in the primaries but not in the fall.
