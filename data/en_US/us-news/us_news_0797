If it makes sense, I'm ready to swap the Sony for the Marantz, which I recently found for $333. Although it has fewer features, I'm hoping that since the Marantz is only 4 inches high vs. 6 inches high for the Sony, it will allow more breathing room and alleviate the heat issue.

We removed about 100 surgeries throughout the course of that week with our general surgeon and our anesthesiologist. We just stay in a village for about a week, giving people free medical treatment and see about 7,000 patients or so in that time."

She went from trendsetter -- igniting a retro-soul movement that sounded at once as classic as her beehive hairdo and as modern as her tattoos -- to punchline. She descended from celebrity to wrecked celebrity -- and, let's face it, that's our favorite celebrity of all.
My heart, though, is with the old-fashioned variety, which is relatively inexpensive ($43 for my new version and perhaps available in yard sales or thrift stores) and easy to operate, once you get the hang of it. After I'd put the grinder together, which only took moments, I dropped 2 pounds of stew meat into the chamber. After some cranking on the handle (it's a great upper arm workout), the meat was through the grinder in minutes.

Three comely 20-something Columbia College fashion students moved through the convention floor, trailed by turning heads and long stares from middle-aged men in black trench coats, all seemingly dressed as the Punisher, the Marvel Comics equivalent of Dirty Harry. "We're getting used to the looks," said Courtney Morelock, cosplaying as the superarcher Artemis, wearing a homemade, midriff-baring green suit. Beside her was Brandi Wickert, in coattails and a one-piece, as the magician Zatanna; and Nina Stockman, her face painted entirely green to cosplay as Miss Martian. They would walk a few feet and have a handful of men approach and ask for a picture. Each time, however, they slipped into their characters effortlessly and agreeably. Stockman's hands, for instance, shot to her temples each time, her eyes going large — at a glance, you might assume she were concentrating hard enough to make the heads of her leering audience explode. But no, she said, "I am just kind of improvising a handful of moves, and they seem to enjoy it."

Boswell - who played the Diana Ross character in the "Dreamgirls" tour - looks and sounds like a star, seizing center stage in a succession of glamorous period outfits. Her delivery of "Someday" is riveting. Doll-like and self-contained, Boswell makes a great contrast with Fenkart, a bundle of energy who defines himself in "Crazy Little Huey."

In the days following the recent drownings of two Bay Area visitors to Hawaii — one hit by a wave at a Maui blowhole, the other falling from oceanside cliffs on the Big Island — I asked readers to share their insights on "trouble spots": places where nature's allure and power, combined with bad decisions, have been particularly hazardous.

The Lions clearly wanted their best player back. And both sides knew what the money would be. Its happy day for the franchise. Lets now hope that the date of this happy day doesnt hurt the Lions moving forward. Because it could just as easily have come a week ago.

But the best dish of all might be Orchid's kashke bademjan — a mash of baked and sautéed eggplant topped with a pool of yogurt and a tinier pool of sautéed mint. Of the many Middle Eastern eggplant dips in Los Angeles, Orchid's kashke bademjan may be the most devoted to the singular taste of unadulterated eggplant: slightly bitter and resonant with deep vegetal sweetness. The texture is profoundly sensuous: an unctuous, mouth-coating stickiness. It feels a little like a vegetarian steak tartare.

Homemade blue cheese dressing is so beguiling, especially when spooned over crisp lettuce and an assortment of cold vegetables. The recipe used here is from David Slay, chef and owner of Park Ave in Stanton. You can make the dressing ahead and store it well-sealed in the refrigerator for several days. I used iceberg lettuce wedges because they are reminiscent of similar salads I enjoyed in my childhood. Romaine works well, too.

In addition, napping for a longer time make it harder to fall asleep at night. If a person is up for most of the night and then opts to take a nap the next day, they will likely feel significant grogginess. Again, this is due to sleep cycles. It would be more helpful in that setting, to take a short nap. Finally, there is a strong social stigma associated with napping.
The actual definition of heaven just might be spending a warm Sonoma afternoon or evening on the arbor-shaded patio of the Dry Creek Kitchen, where you nibble on the house-made charcuterie (with three kinds of mustard) or the salmon carpaccio decorated with tiny edible flowers. If that's not enough to propel you into paradise, you'll find 650 local wines on Dry Creek's wine list. As with Barndiva, the focus here is on local ingredients. On Saturdays, you're likely to spot chef Dustin Valette at the Healdsburg Farmers Market, planning that night's menu, but at DCK, those local ingredients receive a dose of sophistication.

Lambi said the board has given consideration to allegations and conducted an investigation, "which is fine." But he wrote in the March 30 memo, "There is also a sense of fairness.

Before the merger, the airport had the highest average fares at any major airport in the country. In the third quarter of 2008, the average fare from Cincinnati was $597 for a domestic round trip compared with a national average of $362, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. But by the third quarter of last year, fares had dropped 38.5 percent to $367. That's because Delta decided to cut fares to win back customers who had been traveling to other airports for lower rates.

Sufficiently mad, the moms kicked butt with first a "Stop the Spraying" campaign, then demonstrations and the publication of materials warning the community about the situation. The government of Argentina got wind and ordered an investigation of the health impacts of pesticides in Ituzaingo.

Emery's scouting antennae might never be better than they are right now, which leads me to suspend my cynicism and consider why things might work out instead of why they won't. McClellin is in the hands of one of the best defensive line coaches in the business. Jeffery has a Pro Bowl-caliber quarterback throwing to him. It's no coincidence that the best second-round wide receivers in recent years have had the same advantage - Vincent Jackson, Greg Jennings, Jordy Nelson, DeSean Jackson and Sidney Rice.

Your laws aren't our laws. That's not hyperbole. It's literally true, according to Robert M. Jarvis, a maritime law professor at Nova Southeastern University Law Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "The law governing cruises has nothing to do with where a passenger lives or buys a ticket," he says. "Instead, federal maritime law, international law, the law of the country where the cruise ship is registered -- typically the Bahamas, Liberia, or Panama -- and the law selected by the cruise line are going to control, and all of these favor the cruise line." That's why it's so hard to find a good lawyer to sue a cruise line. There aren't many. Maritime law, or admiralty law, is "incredibly complex," says Jarvis. "Only a few lawyers have the necessary training and experience to deal with such matters, and most of them are working for the cruise lines," he adds.

Similarly anachronistic, Howard Warshaw’s untitled portrait of a woman from 1944 draws on Old Master conventions filtered through Surrealism and topped off with a Gothic tinge. The woman, with her sad, almost skeletal face and tattered clothing, looks surprisingly current—she might feel right at home in a Pop Surrealist exhibition. Of course from today’s vantage point, the schism between abstract and representational art seems silly, but in the 1940s and 50s work like this must have looked severely retrograde. Hence the term, “Abject Expressionism,” which Duncan seems to have coined.

Now, for a show at Marc Selwyn Fine Art in L.A., Bochner is remaking 10 of these groundbreaking works but out of brilliantly colored glass fragments instead. "Color changes everything," he said.

My thoughts and prayers go out to them in this difficult time." -- former Auburn baseball coach Hal Baird, who was Hancock's coach.

I realize there are some studies that say depression is one of the more common symptoms experienced by athletes that have had a history of concussions. But there are also studies that show many NFL players are bankrupt within a few years of retirement.

YouTube could similarly be required to police infringements.

Americans embrace innovation. It is in our DNA. We are always on the lookout for new ways to do something faster, cheaper, better. From the horse and buggy to the automobile; from the rotary telephone to the iPhone, we're always willing to embrace innovation if it will make our lives more efficient and productive.

Looking carefully at who faces long-term unemployment by education, age and occupation reveals that two groups have had the hardest time finding work: older workers and those just entering the labor force. But older workers were hardest hit in this recession. People 55-64 had the highest unemployment rates and the longest unemployment. Nearly 40 percent of unemployed people 25-34 had been jobless more than six months by November 2010, compared with 60 percent of those 55-64. For the less educated, African-Americans and the disabled, loss of work in greater percentages started at age 45. Older workers with long bouts of unemployment were increasingly likely to drop out of the labor force by 2011.

Alter has a confident, bold style, but many dishes lack subtlety and finesse, and on one visit I was surprised how many dishes had sweet elements. Day boat scallops ($25) were flavored with blood orange. The chicken dish ($24) - fried wing, confit leg and chunks of meat - one of my favorites over three visits, featured wheat berries with carrots, parsnips and other root vegetables. It was accented with foie gras and Banyuls, a dessert wine. The bavette steak ($28) comes with a great bearnaise sauce, but also artichoke, sunchokes and quince.

Since the New Deal, the Supreme Court has defined commerce very broadly to include anything that could have any effect on interstate commerce. That broad reading empowers Congress to make it illegal for your 8-year-old to operate a homemade lemonade stand and refuse to sell lemonade to racial minorities. Why? The water, sugar, fruit juice and revenue -- even in tiny amounts -- could have an effect on interstate commerce. That same thinking now makes it a federal crime to commit an act of kidnapping across state lines. Or to engage in Internet crimes. The only question to be asked by a court in reviewing a law predicated on the Commerce Clause is whether it could have an effect on interstate commerce.
Nearly a year before Brown, a Democrat from Avon, Ohio, is up for re-election, the world’s largest business federation has targeted him with a pair of negative television ads as it launched a nationwide 2012 election effort the group promises will be the "largest voter education and grassroots mobilization campaign in its nearly 100 year history."

"I'm just kind of coming to terms with it in my own mind, not thinking about getting 80-90 points. I'm really taking a lot of pride in not completely playing the David Backes role, but being right there. You look at Backes' last series, look at what he did to stop their top line. Maybe people don't see that in the stat sheet, but he was one of our best players, sacrificing for the team, and I want to be a team guy like that."

6:54 p.m. -- GIANTS 31, CARDINALS 19. Nice grab by TE Kevin Boss for his fifth TD of the season, a 10-yard catch. Boss jumped up for the ball -- after it's tipped at the line of scrimmage -- then easily walked into the end zone. The Oregon native has a large contingent of family and friends at this game -- the Giants' only one on the West Coast -- so this must be an extra-satisfying TD for him.

Answer - Most people have never heard of antidiuretic hormone, also called vasopressin or arginine vasopressin. It comes from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. It preserves body-fluid balance by regulating urine volume. If the body is low on fluids, ADH secretion diminishes urine production, and body fluid levels rise. If the body has too much fluid, ADH production drops off, urine output increases and body fluid levels drop.

Ferus — which must by now be the best-chronicled gallery in the history of the region — was arguably the first Southland art space that tapped into the art world's currents and channeled them in new ways. At the time, Los Angeles was provincial compared to Eastern cities or San Francisco, and the city's art world was small and not terribly distinctive. Abstract art was a shock to many, and though some galleries concentrated on, say, Austrian expressionism or French painting, there was not much sense of a Los Angeles school.

I wanted to order them, yet went for something new: maple custard with orange toffee and smoked vanilla bean gelee.

Harman: Conflict is inevitable. There's some work on couples' four styles of dealing with it. One is voice, where you can openly discuss it and it's constructive. Loyalty is another, where you wait and see if it'll get better; it's positive in that you're not acting out, but it's very passive. More destructive is a passive-aggressive style ... where you ignore the partner and say things that have nothing to do with the problem. The last is exit, where you leave the room, slam the door, threaten to leave.

"A" is for "attitude," and Kasich hasn't added ethnic diversity to his Cabinet's membership, though people close to him vow he will.

We gave them 11 straight scores to end the second quarter. We talked about we had 47 points and we should have been winning the game. Our defense let us down. Then we came out, we were active, we finished with 25 fastbreak points. We took care of the ball."

Christie stoked the fire last year with a private meeting with Michael Oren, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, and in February with a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group.
I do. I'm very optimistic about the future of the band. The drama we experienced was not uncommon; a lot of bands face turnover. You have to deal with your personal life. It's hard to say if we've had more or less problems and issues of that nature than other bands. I think we've tried very much to learn from our mistakes, which is pushing ourselves too hard at the expense of our enjoyment of what we're doing. I find generally that even though we're as busy as we've ever been, we enjoy ourselves a lot more. Everyone seems to be comfortable but excited to be doing this. Based on that alone, I very much look forward to keeping on.

The Obama administration and the department strongly oppose the program, and the president's fiscal 2012 budget proposal to Congress does not include funding for it.
That means you have to protect yourself, and that means "Trust but verify." Apply that Cold War mantra about WMDs to buying travel. Never accept a claim of "discount" or "special price" without checking through some third-party source. And never make a fare comparison without including any fake optional fees.
Taken separately, these transgressions raise significant concerns about Alexander's discretion and understanding of the job of district attorney. As a pattern of behavior, they suggest he does not have the capacity to deliver fair and impartial justice to the people of Del Norte County.
In the first 10 minutes I was hooked. It was unlike anything I'd been expecting. I guess I was expecting a small boat but bigger, but it wasn't like that at all. Ships are basically floating hotels, very large, and they have every amenity you could imagine. There was a lot of room and a lot of activities. Plus everyone on the cruise is always happy. I think a lot of the anxiety I had went away. I had no issue with long lines or seasickness. I've still never played shuffleboard.

Harris did work out Wednesday, and he hopes teams won't hold his condition against him.
If last season's disastrous team challenge -- the one where Tim Gunn chewed out then-Portlander Gretchen Jones for pushing around her teammates -- was cringe-inducing, this one was infuriating. It's one thing to only think about yourself when you're competing on a reality show -- that comes with the territory. But it's another to be mean, and then have the gall to complain when the victim of your abuse gets upset about it.
Drinking enough, but not too much, is important in the days leading up to an event.
Nic Batum also scored 8 points (3-4) in the first quarter, and earned a pair of trips to the line.

The potatoes can be done a day ahead.

Then, as calmly as only the best can do, Theriot, who finished with five points on the evening, let fly with the jumper from the top of the key that found nothing but net. A more than fitting end to an all-star game.
Today, Zoe and Goreski have gone their separate ways. Asked about his relationship with Zoe and the whispered speculation that the two are either feuding or fake-feuding for publicity's sake, Goreski shrugs. "She doesn't speak to me — I have no idea why," he says. "It happened before my show ever got picked up. I work with one of her former clients, but I didn't solicit her."
The state Department of Finance is challenging several Orange County cities over redevelopment bills – throwing into question the fate of hundreds of millions of dollars that the cities say must be paid, while the state says: not so much.
Sundberg hadn't entertained the possibility of winning the emerging artist Ivey ("I would have bought a new dress and invited my mom"). The honor hasn't changed her life much and she laughs at the mention of a five-year plan. She played a slot machine last winter in "Flesh and the Desert" for Workhaus Collective and then took on a spiky, pigtailed druggie in "Beautiful Thing" for Latté Da. The well has run dry now, of course, which means she'll be browsing help-wanted ads. Still.

Kronwall's teammates, who had a better view, thought the hit might warrant some time off for Stewart.
Democrats generally insist that taxing the wealthy and cutting defense spending can solve everything. Most Republicans look to cut everything but defense -- including taxes. With November likely to be close, the easy path for both Obama and Romney will be to stick to pat answers their bases love.

The roof also was strengthened, inspiring visitors to once again look heavenward.

It has been a month and a day since a gunman opened fire on two men stepping off a bus at the corner of Central and Vernon avenues.

It appears all too easy to forget in our political culture today that we are all from the same place. I am an American first and foremost. I support my President regardless of his or her party. I value the life I have in this great nation and wish for a positive future for my children. But, to be honest, I am disgusted by what I see around me, especially the divisive and hateful speech from our national and other political leaders. When did "constructive compromise" for the greater good become an evil phrase?

The district also is a study in contrasts --the stone mansions of Shaker Heights, boarded-up cottages in Cleveland's Ward 4 and 1, the illuminated glow of the Bedford Auto Mile, to the eclectic neon of Shaker Square's sidewalk cafes, chrome-and-glass buildings in Highland Hills and the almost-deserted shell of the North Randall Mall.

My father showed me how to squeeze oranges into juice, to catch fish and clean them, and to pry abalones off the rocks and make chowder with them.

This is not just silly, but sad. How hard would it be to say, "Look, Fairy. Somebody overreacted. You can have your job back.

Still, for a politician of her stature she is remarkably authentic, retaining the earnest relentlessness she brought to Washington as a back-bencher two decades ago.

Weck says: "Actually, it does the exact opposite. It puts the baby's pelvis in a posterior tilt, which facilitates lumbar flexion, not extension. That puts the baby's chest behind the pelvis. Then the head has to come too far forward. It's no longer positioned directly above the chest."
However, in the fall of 2008, having spent the summer recess facing the wrath of constituents who themselves faced $4 per gallon gasoline prices, Congress wised up. Instead of extending these economy-killing offshore-oil-production moratoria, lawmakers did nothing (thankfully) and let them expire. The Bush administration then initiated the process to develop the oil reserves off both the East and West coasts in its 2010-2015 five-year plan.

“Actually, the Ravens may have been better off to have had the injury happen after the draft.

Undoubtedly, it's a complete coincidence that June 30 will be just four months before the Nov. 6 election, when Ohioans will fill the House's 99 seats and half the Senate's 33. June is also the high season for General Assembly fundraising: Legislators want to get home in time to strut in July 4 parades. And fiscal year's end also means lobbyists must justify their fees to antsy clients. You don't know what persistence means until you've watched a lobbyist shop "technical" amendments around the Statehouse in June, late in the legislative session. And, to borrow a bank jingle, if there's a need, there's a dollar -- a campaign contributor's scratch for a lawmaker's political itch.
