With three out of five members vacating their posts after Loquat's last major tour, it's a wonder this album even exists. Thankfully, the Bay Area group's pop sensibilities remain intact - reinvigorated, even - after the unexpected personnel shakeup. Recorded at Berkeley's Fantasy Studios with a crack production team that included the Rondo brothers (Foster the People) and Dave Cooley (M83), the album packs several festival-ready moments, including the jaunty title track and stargazing "Time Bending." Singer-guitarist Kylee Swenson's gorgeous voice, meanwhile, is still the main draw; tempering the incandescent melodies of "We Could Be Arsonists" with melancholy sweetness and lovely folksy undertones. You would never guess that she finished her vocal parts while nine months pregnant.

Twenty years ago, what kept you from distributing a book without authorization — the law. Anyone could have photocopied a book.

There's no question a segment of Pakistan's population — possibly including elements in the army and intelligence services — resents America's presence in the region and secretly sympathizes with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Some Pakistanis describe the bin Laden killing as an American plot to humiliate Pakistan's military, which didn't show up until the intruders were gone.

Nor will you find hotels, pools, beach clubs or even a concession stand littering the pristine shoreline of this state park.

OK, so he can't say anything, save for this tidbit: "A lot of the characters from Season 2 will be back.

Of course, the lines aren't always so clear. Christopher Nolan's Batman movies prove that well-worn characters can be the basis for intelligent, thoughtful and provocative blockbusters. Improbably, the screenplay to "Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted" was written by indie-movie darling Noah Baumbach ("The Squid and the Whale," "Greenberg").

The World Health Organization says SLIT is a viable alternative to immunotherapy injections, and it's been used successfully for years in Europe. The safety record is very good, and major studies have demonstrated its effectiveness. So why isn't SLIT used more often in the United States?

It's considered off-label use.

The sooner a family starts to save for higher education, the more affordable it will be. However, many families think they don't need to prepare for higher education expenses when their child is an infant or toddler, often putting off the task until their child is in high school. State-sponsored and tax-advantaged college savings plans, called 529 plans after section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, allow families to start saving from the time their child is born. In fact, saving for higher education can start in a 529 savings plan as soon as a couple begins to think about starting a family if the parent enrolls as the account holder and names himself or herself as beneficiary. Prospective grandparents can even open accounts the same way, as can any relative or family friend.

John Harbison and Vijay Iyer both confronted titans of the Classical era in Haydn and Mozart respectively. Harbison offered both a comment on and completion to the initial two movements of Haydn's Op. 103; his buoyant finale echoed the balance and tensions of the original. Iyer took a different tack in his comment on Mozart's fragmentary E Minor quartet: acknowledging in his program note the inherent absurdity of being tasked to complete a Mozart work, he dwelled on a final phrase, repeated it obsessively, tore it apart, took it wandering and brought it back tattered but recognizable. Knowing what we do of Mozart's sense of humor, he'd likely have appreciated Iyer's work, and at the very least gotten a good laugh from it.

The presumptive Republican nominee aims to set the nation on a very different course early next year. The general consensus about the social contract has been fairly reliable since the days of the New Deal, but Romney intends to rewrite it. A press secretary for the Republican National Committee recently said Romney and his party would pursue the policies of the Bush administration, "just updated." Democrats rejoiced - it meant they could tell voters Romney would simply represent Bush's third term. But in important ways, they're both wrong. Romney is more extreme. Those quietly hoping that he doesn't mean what he says are making a sucker's bet.

A child with this foundation would be fine to start kindergarten. I think kindergarten is the time when formal handwriting with proper letter strokes should begin.

Arthur Drooker's haunting infrared images stand out, however, as a testament to the sheer beauty and power of documentary black-and-white photography.

Bruce was born on Sept. 23, 1949 at Monmouth Memorial Hospital (now Monmouth Medical Center) in Long Branch. He grew up in Freehold. I've been a Springsteen fan since 1975 and saw my first show in 1976, so there's a lot of memories and it was hard to cut it down to 60.

NH - Eddie Delia 40 run (Matt Fogel kick)
BEREA, Ohio -- Round Two Friday night was all about protecting assets from Round One.
It's true that up to now Santorum's rise in the past month (from 23 percent) has come at the expense of Gingrich, who stood at 22 percent in the same poll a month ago. But that simply doesn't translate to a correspondent diminution of support for Romney if one of those two were out of the picture. Seeking clarity on this question, the survey then removed each candidate's name from the mock head-to-head.
Or even that they claimed both the singles and doubles championship on their way to earning the revered, once-in-a-generation “dynasty” label.

We remember because: For more than 50 years, the 183-foot Union 76 tower was one of the first things drivers viewed from the upper deck of the Bay Bridge coming into San Francisco. The analog clock was updated in the 1970s with a digital version. The tower came down after Union 76 scaled back and Bank of America bought the land.
Biden did mention the Los Angeles event in his interview Sunday.

At the peak of Richard Chamberlain’s thrillingly malevolent performance in “The Heiress,” the audience at the Pasadena Playhouse started hissing. If we had had tomatoes, we probably would have thrown them. The theater might want to frisk future ticketholders for produce, or add an anger-management session to the bill: It’s that hard to handle the emotions provoked by this gorgeously directed and acted revival.
"Bring It On" promises to be the latest of the lip-gloss musicals - shows like "Wicked," "Hairspray" and "Legally Blonde" that have uncovered a brand-new Broadway audience: teen and pre-teen girls. The show has a different story from the popular "Bring It On" movies (there are five of them, starting with a 2000 comedy that starred Kirsten Dunst.)

Others are wondering how the company's rich valuation will play with investors. Facebook would have a P-E of more than 80 times its 2011 earnings. And its valuation is 19 times its revenue, Renaissance's Smith says, which is close to the 21 times revenue valuation of its faster-growing competitor, LinkedIn, Smith says.

We need to make sure American workers get first crack at jobs - but when they won't take certain jobs or can't meet the qualifications for others, employers need legal access to workers who can and will. And we need whatever system we create to be flexible enough to accommodate the business cycle, with visas going up during boom times and down during recessions.
Currently, no chemical nematicides or soil fumigants are available to home gardeners for nematode control in backyard gardens and home landscapes.
There should, and will, be some zone looks mixed in there. A lot of blitz packages rely upon a zone look behind them. But if I’m seeing a lot of rookie linebackers trying to cover the middle of the field against an offense even Tom Coughlin noted has been very good at attacking the seams, I’m going to question such a game plan because I have a strong feeling it won’t work out well for the Giants.
The fire department is on track to overspend by more than $2 million this year, Rainford said, and the city will have to pay $4.7 million more to float pensions next year. The city only has $6 million in reserves, he said.

The dream is to one day have a city public school play a private school in the championship game. This year, Digital Harbor nearly made it. The Rams earned their way to the semifinal, where they fell to No. 2 Gilman, 3-2.
Ideally, the revenue would go into the cash-strapped general fund. And even if it didn't, but was targeted for higher education, it's unclear that tuition breaks constitute the best use. At California State University, where tuition would drop from about $6,000 to $2,000 a year, the bigger problem might not be what families pay — plenty of middle-class families earning less than $150,000 can afford $6,000 for tuition — but the scarcity of classes for all the enrolled students. And it's worth remembering that CSU (and UC) students whose families earn about $80,000 or less already receive a free ride on tuition.
Tourism officials and developer Thinh are banking on the caves to help Quang Binh draw a bigger share of the 5 million tourists who travel to Vietnam, and the growing interest in Son Doong no doubt will help.

Cribbs TD: Wasted in the loss was Josh Cribbs' career-long 84-yard punt return for a touchdown that pulled the Browns to within 20-7 in the third quarter. It was his third career punt return for a score and 11th total return touchdown of his career, which is the fifth-most in NFL history. It was his first punt return for a touchdown since the 2009 season opener, when he returned one 67 yards against Minnesota on Sept. 13. Cribbs has totaled 20 career touchdowns; two rushing, three on punt returns, seven receiving and eight on kickoffs.
The National League West, however, is there for the taking. It's a weak division. While Justin Upton is for real, the rest of Arizona's roster feels like a desert mirage. The San Francisco hitters are lost in the fog. The Dodgers have a legitimate contender for best player (Matt Kemp) and top pitcher (Clayton Kershaw) in the league, but shouldn't $2 billion have bought the team's new ownership more?
Well, I cannot afford to shop at Westfield Mall. I will take my holiday shopping elsewhere.
Pods are often used for temporary storage of household items when someone is moving in or out of a home. City officials don't want them to stay for long periods of time.

"We expect 100 percent of our gas to come from Canada," Hansen said. "We will pay a lot of taxes and employ an awful lot of people. These jobs will either be going to British Columbia or Oregon. Why would we not want them here? The last I saw there were 183,000 unemployed Oregonians."

One bright spot for Medicare is that the pace of cost increases has eased somewhat, even as baby boomers are turning 65 at the rate of 10,000 a day and becoming eligible for the program. So instead of speeding toward a budget cliff, Medicare is merely steering toward insolvency.
Sam DiGregorio had a construction/remodeling business, DiGregorio Enterprises. But when the economy went south, the work dried up, leaving DiGregorio, like so many others, with a silent phone.
When this unit struggles as it did in Philadelphia, everything on offense gets out of whack. Colt McCoy doesn't have the natural ability of Michael Vick to make plays on his own when his line fails him, so it has to be consistently good.

Villaraigosa, himself a former union organizer, said reducing employee costs is essential to closing a $238-million shortfall and further securing the city's long-term financial stability. He said the city's budget shortfall would have reached $1 billion next year had the city failed to reduce expenses over the last three years, including the slashing of 3,743 employees from the payroll through layoffs, transfers and early retirement.

At Orlando Lutheran Towers, a midlevel retirement center in downtown Orlando that opened in 1980, the small, simple apartments that satisfied previous generations are being enlarged to fit the supersized, technology-obsessed generation.
After that, every underdog wanted in on the action. The White Sox used "Don't Stop Believin'" for their 2005 playoff run. The Dodgers started playing it at Chavez Ravine during their seventh inning stretch, much to the chagrin of Steve Perry, who is a huge San Francisco Giants fan. This postseason gave Perry an opportunity to take the song back for the team he loves, and sure enough, the former Journey frontman started showing up at Mays Field and leading surprise singalongs.
Vicki Anthes, planning section chief for the parks and recreation division of the DNR, said plans have been in the works for about two years to locate an Outdoor Adventure and Discovery Center and department offices in about 45,000 square feet of the building. Most of the $12.5-million project cost is already appropriated, with construction scheduled to start this fall.
Details remain unclear, but at a minimum the project would create a few thousand short-term construction jobs and add several hundred skilled manufacturing or research employees to Intel's Hillsboro work force.
Ballard’s 604 yards would’ve been a startling number for a tight end perhaps a decade ago. Not anymore. On the other side of the field tomorrow, the Patriots will have the most prolific tight end duo in NFL history in Gronkowski and Hernandez — both of whom New England selected in the 2010 draft. Gronkowski had 1,327 receiving yards and 17 touchdowns during the regular season, while Hernandez had 919 yards and seven scores.

Sharon Sweet, 61, of Hampstead, was walking her first Komen race Sunday to support a friend who is a 10-year survivor.
I don't imagine I'll ever give up on the institutional church. I'm not one who thinks that being spiritual is superior to being religious. But it's not impossible that the Church can sometimes lose sight of what it means to pattern ourselves after the Kingdom of Heaven. Maybe sometimes our churches need to act more like nets and less like boats, which means we believers need to take some big risks, trusting that the only safe harbor is with God. We do not need to be afraid of the world, and all the treasures it contains. We do not need to view science, or the arts, or the world around us with suspicion. We do not need to spend all our time and energy building bigger and safe boats.
