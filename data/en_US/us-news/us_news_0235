CB Aaron Ross. He picked a good time to play a complete game, with very good coverage and excellent physical play. When the Pats ran the end around his way and he avoided LT Matt Light to make a tackle for a 1-yard loss, I tweeted New England should be running that play CB Corey Webster’s way. They did in the second half and picked up 17 yards when Webster’s attempt to duck under RT Sebastian Vollmer didn’t work out nearly as well as Ross’ dodging Light.

• Defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove (now with the Green Bay Packers) is suspended without pay for the first eight games of the 2012 regular season. Hargrove actively participated in the program while a member of the Saints. Hargrove submitted a signed declaration to the league that established not only the existence of the program at the Saints, but also that he knew about and participated in it.

Hargrove also actively obstructed the league's 2010 investigation into the program by being untruthful to investigators.

“It strikes me as odd that in an independent survey you didn’t get one parent who gave you a good cuss out,” board President Toby Sanders said. “Some of these children are the most troubled children that we have in the district and odds are, if you talk to five of these parents they’d have some serious complaints. The smallness of the sample size suggests that it is not necessarily to be taken as being statistically significant over the whole body.”

A new crop of religious evangelists appeared, like sweet Rosie McClure, who promised the good a heaven like "an eternal Costa del Sol liberally supplied with food, drink, sun and sexual pleasure." Even hell wouldn't be so bad -- like "an uncomfortable fourth-rate hotel where incompatible guests are forced to endure each other's company for eternity and do their own washing-up with inadequate facilities."

Despite a rush to crown "Boardwalk Empire" as the next great cable drama, though, the 12-episode first season was uneven. That goes for the storytelling, character development and, yes, pacing.

That period, the writer says, was a dark one. After lashing out at executives — "I had a phenomenal propensity toward terrorist behavior" — Baitz holed up in his Sag Harbor, N.Y., cabin.

Portland State and UP have always accepted that they're stepping-stone programs in the event one of their coaches should have high-level success. And what the Beavers and Ducks haven't been willing to acknowledge is that their programs have been surpassed by a handful of mid-majors.

The value of the life estate is based upon the parent’s age and the value of the real estate. By way of illustration, if a child’s house is worth $300,000 and a parent is 70 years of age, then the life estate will have a value of $181,566. If the parent pays the child $181,566.00 and lives in that child’s house for at least one year, then Medicaid will not consider this transaction to be a “gift.” Otherwise if it is considered a gift, then the parent will be denied Medicaid to pay for the cost of long-term care.

Unsurprisingly, the majority of kung-fu classics in this five-movie series (all shown on rare 35mm prints) were produced by the powerhouse Shaw Brothers production team. The brothers boasted a stable of under-contract directors and stars that included future "Kill Bill" star Gordon Liu in Lau Kar-Leung's 1978 masterpiece "The 36th Chamber of Shaolin" (9 p.m. Saturday), which is artful and thrilling despite being mostly about training rather than actual fighting (though there's plenty of that, too). Don't miss the killer opening sequence, a feast of percussive sound, solo fighting moves (by Liu) and cascading water that might very well have inspired the opening title scene of Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing." Other films include the social commentary of "Opium and the Kung Fu Master" (7 p.m. Jan. 29) and the fun "Snake in the Eagle's Shadow" (7 p.m. Feb. 5), which combines slapstick humor and Jackie Chan's breakthrough role with lots of action, including a fight between a cat and a cobra.

Some even say we should prioritize the morning meal by eating breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. But, Lichten said, “How many of us eat dinner like a pauper?” In her new book, “Dr. Jo’s Eat Out Healthy,” she reveals the fat trap with big breakfasts. “Even when breakfast out is just once a week," she writes, "the traditional large bacon, eggs and biscuit meal can put on excessive pounds.”

It was Matthews' idea. After an impressive preseason, the Blazers' big offseason signing has been upset at his play in the first week of the regular season, especially after his performance in Chicago, when he had five points and zero contributions in the areas where he makes his mark: rebounds, steals, assists.
This is probably obvious, but I figured it was worth pointing out anyway. Teams are allowed to franchise only one player. So since Rice is the one, that means that left guard Ben Grubbs will hit the market and be able to sign with any team he pleases if the two sides cannot reach a deal by March 13, the day free agency starts. While you are only allowed to franchise one player per year, you are allowed to franchise that same player for consecutive years. So if Rice and the Ravens can’t reach an agreement on a long-term deal by July 16, we’re probably going to be talking about the same thing at this time next year.
The details: We've previously looked at importer Terry Theise's "Reading Between the Vines," which brings his fractal, florid prose about wine's essence into long form. What's noteworthy about the paperback edition ($17.95, UC Press, 208 pages) is Theise's new foreword, which occupies itself with the soulfulness of loving wine. In a mere 11 pages, he wipes away all the artifice of quantifying the stuff and putting it in little boxes. It's just the thing for a long holiday plane flight.

You don't need to know the exact science of what makes a great grilled cheese sandwich to be able to enjoy it.

Umami has become a trendy spot for the Cow Hollow/Marina set. Even though we booked a couple days in advance, we could only get a 6 p.m. reservation. When we arrived, there were only a half-dozen people in the 136-seat place. We waited at the door for the host, but when she came back to the station, instead of acknowledging us, she activated her computer screen and conducted a little host business. As is too often the case these days, she seemed to have been hired for her look -- short skirt and high heels -- rather than for her skill at making diners feel welcome.

But consider this: A man could have three drinks a day four days a week — the equivalent of two six-packs of beer over four days — and still be within the NIAAA definition of low-risk drinking. Low risk is not no risk, and that amount of drinking can lead to alcohol-related problems.
Bowman has Crawford signed for two more years and he deserves a chance to show this season was a sophomore slump. Bowman's decision to sign Ray Emery worked out and he rewarded him with an extension.
Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking from the same stage, proclaimed himself equally distraught. "For the life of me, I can't begin to understand why this is something that is a debate in Congress," he lamented.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a leading opponent of the bills, said the groundswell of opposition to legislation dealing with the esoteric subject of copyright law showed that Americans understand that "while combatting copyright infringement is important, you shouldn't do extensive damage to the Net."

"There is very good evidence there is resistance to the Emerald Ash borer in China's ashes," said Kris Bachtell, the arboretum's director of collections and facilities. "If you want to test a species for its insect and disease resistance, it's best to test a tree that's not a hybrid. That's why we collect wild seeds, to get the species' pure form. We have few, if any, of the species we collected already on our ground."

Observers cite a variety of reasons that PERS reform has lost momentum.
When the group emerged from the New York underground in 2004, straightforward rock was a commodity in short supply. This was the heyday of angular, arty post-punk, theatrical indie-folk and the so-called “new wave of new wave.” In the midst of all that, the members of Hold Steady got on city stages with electric guitars, turned up the volume and delivered muscular, riff-driven rock songs closer to Thin Lizzy or the E Street Band than anything then fashionable. Finn wrote about drug deals, killer parties and lowlifes — but also about classic literature and Catholicism. Mysterious characters drifted in and out of his songs, gracing a few verses and disappearing, only to re-emerge a few songs or an entire album later. In his distinctive half-sung, half-spoken delivery, Finn acted as a conduit to a starlit world of desperate people searching for transcendence in churches, clubs and the back seats of speeding cars.
Said Billy Kenney of Beachwood, “Jose was one of the faces of this franchise. But we haven’t shown enough grit or desire to win in 10 years. Jose’s decision to bunt and sit the rest of the game was a glaring example of that. It was time for a change in attitude.”

And judging from the content of the list, testing is a big part of that problem. Only a quarter of the recommendations fell in the category of "don't treat" — as in, don't prescribe more chemotherapy for end-stage cancer that is beyond hope. The remainder fell in the category of "don't test."

No one can know with certainty (or even presume to know) what happened between this unnamed male student and each of the women involved. However, we do know how the women students say they were treated -- by the university, by law enforcement, by medical personnel and by their fellow students.

You never think of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as punk-rock. But in the late '70s, that's almost what they seemed like: a fresh alternative to the overblown prog-rock and safe pop of the day -- not as angry or as crude as real punk, of course, but derived from the same back-to-basics spirit. (Elvis Costello's raw but tuneful debut album, "My Aim Is True," created the same impression.)

Besides, conservative Protestants don't think of their own views as inconsistent, and they have a long-standing way, going back to at least the mid-19th century, of dividing the scientific findings they believe and don't believe. They tend to accept scientists' claims that are based on direct observation and common sense and to reject those based on what might be called unobservable abstractions. Since nobody was around for the Big Bang and for human evolution from lower primates, these unobservable claims are treated with more skepticism than measurements of the effect of airborne carbon on planetary temperature. (Despite biblical passages suggesting the contrary, conservative Protestants believe the Earth orbits the sun, which is observable by scientists in the present.)

Why they could win it: It is possible to ride the performances of one or two great players to the NCAA championship—or don’t you remember 2011? Thomas Robinson and Tyshawn Taylor are even a more imposing combination than Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb were for UConn.
