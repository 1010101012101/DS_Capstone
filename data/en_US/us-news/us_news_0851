A voice over the loudspeaker interrupts the thrum: "If you are driving a white Jaguar parked in the back behind another car, please move your vehicle."
If this party-hearty fatalism sounds like Prince’s apocalyptic "1999," well, there’s a good reason for that. Hit radio in 2011 is saturated with foreboding. Our popular songwriters seem convinced that we’re teetering on the brink of cataclysm. Desperate dancing won’t hold it back. We’d better enjoy the shindig tonight, because tomorrow will be beyond imagining. Sometimes the party gets conflated with the end times: that was the message of Britney Spears’ "Till the World Ends." Lady Gaga doesn’t even bother with the party — "Edge of Glory" skips straight to the rapture.

So it seems to a casual observer, anyway. La Russa is not one of those old-school managers who trots out his eight best players day after day. Every day is a new lineup, and often, it will include a bizarre element. Maybe the pitcher will bat eighth. Somebody will play out of position.
We slept well, and our 5-year-old especially enjoyed hopping back and forth between the hotel pool and the 12-person whirlpool. Be warned, however, that the pool and whirlpool are positioned on a big fourth-floor terrace that catches a near-blinding amount of reflected light on sunny days.

Before "The Kingdom" gets going in earnest -- though earnest is hardly the word for this coldly efficient action thriller -- the main titles offer a lesson in the history of the Middle East, and especially Saudi Arabia, where the action is set. The lesson, brief enough to avoid any risk of education, is conveyed mostly by snazzy graphics and cut to the rhythms of a music video: essentially it's oil, sheiks, oil, alien culture, oil, Shell-Exxon-Mobil, shaky sheiks and extremist Wahabi militants threatening our supplies of oil. Once the title sequence ends, MTV history gives way to Hollywood present -- horror depicted powerfully, as only a feature film can do, and a fevered response out of formula TV.

There are now 36 buoys in the array, compared to just six in December 2004, when a magnitude-9.0 earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, generated a massive tsunami that caused more than 200,000 deaths in several nations around the Indian Ocean.

By putting the focus on the Strait of Hormuz, Obama makes it easy for Iran to appear to be making concessions. Iran doesn’t want the strait closed because that would mean an end to its own oil exports; no other country in the world would lose more.

Nunez also misjudged a fly ball from Adam Jones that bounced on the track, assuming it was a home run, and then jogged after Chris Davis’ double in the eighth. Perhaps bored to distraction, the crowd didn’t even boo Nunez at the time — they saved that for when he struck out looking in the ninth.

So, what's the solution? That's for every woman to determine for herself — to decide whether "one's life must matter," as Ms. Thatcher would say, in a sense larger than herself, and whether that's something for which she wants to spend her entire existence striving. The Thatcher kind of success is so rare because, in part, the counter-pressures are enormous.

Most of the time, the brain damage occurs in small enough amounts that it goes unobserved by the patient, family members, or friends. In effect, the patient is experiencing a series of small strokes. The mental deterioration thus proceeds in a "stepwise" pattern, in which a person experiences a cognitive decline, seems to stabilize, then further deteriorates after another stroke. Specific symptoms may include confusion, slurred speech, or impaired thinking. This type of vascular dementia is also known as multi-infarct dementia.
“They score a lot of goals,” he said. “We know they’re a transition team. They like to draw and dump and push two or three passes and have somebody step into it. They feed the crease very well. We’re a different team defensively than we were three weeks ago, which I’m very thankful for. We’ve grown, and that’s important. I can’t tell you we’re peaking right now. I still think our best lacrosse is still ahead of these kids. I just want to continue to move forward.”

All that said, the most important thing is that when the council meets on Monday, it needs to pick someone. The council is doing real damage to its integrity and to the public faith in local government in a pointless fight over which of two good options to choose.

The upshot of the study, reviewed on a nytimes.com blog last week, is that it doesn’t take much to control our blood sugar levels with exercise - just 30 minutes over the course of a day, or around 10,000 steps per day. That is the amount of exercise that can easily be achieved by adding up the minutes from a lunch time or after-dinner walk around the neighborhood, riding a bike to work or to the store, walking the stairs at work instead of taking the elevator, or parking in a space farthest away from the store entrance.

Ohio's Democrats in the House meantime criticized the cuts to social spending -- the Women, Infants and Children's food program will lose $504 million, and community health centers $600 million, according to the House Appropriations Committee.

The Cottleville Fire Protection District plans to review its situation after voters Tuesday said no to Proposition CARES - a 27-cent property tax increase - by a wide margin.
A: When George Nicholas opened Olympia 31 years ago, he imagined a casual take-out place. His customers wanted a sit-down restaurant with waiters. So Olympia became a taverna, the Greek term for a casual restaurant. (It's not a tavern, although liquor is served.) Pressed-tin ceilings, church-pew benches and a gleaming floor-to-ceiling bar add to the Old World feeling.

I was in the Market Street Safeway about 2 the other night, trying to make a salad. I was dressed as I normally am for side-dish preparation: high heels, black satin skirt and top and plenty of lip gloss. I had all the necessary ingredients for a delicious salad in my hand basket: Reddi-wip and extra-large Trojans. OK, maybe it was a slightly more regional dish I was preparing, but I found myself lingering over the cucumbers long enough to draw someone's attention.

I thought the Browns conveyed the wrong message at the Mike Holmgren-Tom Heckert season-ending press conference. They were defensive, albeit less so than previously, about their long-range plan. They exuded no excitement about the opportunities that lie ahead with multiple first-round picks. They failed to generate any excitement about the prospect of immediately bolstering the offense through the draft and free agency. It was almost as if they were perplexed, if not overwhelmed, by the task at hand.
"It's going to be pretty hostile, too."
To me, I purchase different games for different reasons. It's all relative. When I have a certain "need" I need met, I pop in the respective game.

Manning said he will work "super fast," slow, under center and "from the gun," but, he promised, and laughed, "I won't line up at wide receiver" and, he won't be operating the run-option offense that the Broncos adopted after Tim Tebow took over at quarterback. "Now, that would be surprising to defenses if I ran the football," Manning said.

BUDAPEST, Hungary —American coffeehouses are prized for their quick service and fast Internet — ideal for people on the go.

Beyond the Falcons’ ability to remain competitive on the field for the long-term, a new stadium provides additional potential benefits to the state-run authority and our region — the prospect of adding a Major League Soccer franchise to Georgia’s professional sports team mix, or attracting more college football playoffs; major events such as a Super Bowl, a World Cup, an NCAA Final Four. This is in addition to enhancing the GWCC’s ability to add to its list of legacy events held at the Georgia Dome.
“This isn’t a one-and-done thing,” Keel said. “There are two legs to it. Do we have to go into L.A. (where) they’ve been good at home? Yeah, but the people we had on the field can make a difference. Is it a tough task? Absolutely, but nothing’s going to be easy from now on.”

1) Navy’s Pat Kiernan. The sophomore long-stick midfielder plays defense (30 groundballs and 12 caused turnovers), takes faceoffs (7-of-15), and creates offense (seven goals and three assists). Kiernan’s ability to initiate transition for the Midshipmen will be a priority for the Johns Hopkins offensive midfielders, who must be alert to sprint back and play defense, according to Blue Jays coach Dave Pietramala. “I think the thing that impresses me the most about him is his ability to get a ball off the floor under duress and then break away from the pack,” Pietramala said of Kiernan. “He’s a guy that you can’t just go in a game and say, ‘He’s a really good long stick.’ You have to account for him. We have to know where he is when the ball’s loose. We’ve got to understand that in transition, he’s a weapon. He’s not just a guy that’s going to move the ball along. He’s shooting 87 percent. That’s a pretty good year for a second-line middie. So when you look at it that way, we have to be very aware of where he is, especially in transition.”

1. He left. Maybe any of us would have. But he was the one who decided not to negotiate last year. And he was the one who left the bad-taste nugget of bunting for a base hit in Game 162, then sprinting for the Grand Central before a full inning was even played.
We wonder if the unemployed realize it's so easy to end their plight. Simply no longer look for work. Then they'd no longer be unemployed. At least by White House logic.
MESSING: Probably not, because the Arizona law should apply only to smuggling-related offenses such as concealing immigrants from law enforcement. Transportation of an undocumented girlfriend will likely be considered to be outside the scope of the kind of illegal transportation contemplated by the statute, but the point will have to be settled finally by the higher courts. Federal courts, in interpreting federal statutes from which the Arizona statute was derived, generally have not considered transportation of illegal immigrants in a social context to be a chargeable offense, but the federal appellate courts themselves are not in total agreement on this point, and an authoritative decision will be required before people can be assured what will happen under given circumstances.
Marylanders born after July 1, 1972, are required to take an eight-hour course to get their boating license, though many choose to take it online.

With roughly seven minutes remaining in the Blazers’ 100-91 win over the Clippers, Miller sprinted down the middle of the lane and bulldozed Griffin, knocking him to the ground.

The about-face is noteworthy because in the mid-1990s Intel was pilloried for its insistence on selling a chip the company knew was flawed.
Hey, Brent: The way the trade was portrayed was that Eric Mangini and Heckert both liked Hillis and wanted him included. I do know that from the start, Mangini talked up Hillis -- even before Hillis emerged as an offensive force. I think Heckert viewed Hillis as a good backup player who exceeded his expectations. Mangini, I believe, put a much greater value on Hillis as a feature back.

Boehner and his pragmatic allies are worried about a backlash from the many constituents who support every line item in the federal budget. But they also have to be concerned about a backlash from the conservative activists who poured out to the polls last November to give the GOP a House majority.

When Budget Chairman Paul Ryan announced his goals for the rest of fiscal 2011 -- the government's running on a continuing resolution that will need to be renewed in early March -- the real savings amounted to only $32 billion. That didn't sit well with many of the freshmen and their conservative allies, including the Republican Study Group, led by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana. Nor did a subsequent boost that gets to $100 billion by cutting defense.

That's about to end. As the 2012 presidential campaign gets under way, potential Republican candidates, including Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, are sharpening their critiques of President Barack Obama as a foreign policy leader.

3. Billy Cundiff, thunderfoot The Ravens kicker, who filled in for Phil Dawson for five games last season with the Browns, is having a career year that is quite inexplicable. It's not so much his .880 field-goal percentage (22-of-25), which is 15 points higher than his career average. It's the amazing length on his kickoffs. Cundiff's 38 touchbacks on 70 kickoffs lead the NFL by plenty. He is two off the NFL record since the kickoff was moved back to the 30-yard line. Now, let's see if he can get even one touchback in The Stadium Where Kickers Go To Die.
After a series of summer blockbusters that individually introduced Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, all these Marvel comics characters come together to save the world. Director and cowriter Joss Whedon pulls off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth) and giving each actor a chance to shine. Eventually, everyone has to come together to battle the common enemy, the preening Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from last year's "Thor," and the climactic battle is dazzling and exhausting. Still, "The Avengers" is at its strongest in its quieter, simpler moments. Rated PG-13; sci-fi violence and action, a drug reference. 2 hours, 23 minutes. By Christy Lemire, Associated Press.

On a recent morning, Kevin was sitting on a sofa in his dad's living room, telling his story. He is now a compactly built young man of 24, with gentle, dark eyes and a thin reddish beard shaved to follow his jawline. He is polite, accommodating and articulate. Five years after jumping off the bridge, he still has flashbacks. He sees himself plummeting toward his death and his body shakes violently. Last May, he cut into his right shoulder with a box cutter and was hospitalized for two months. Since then, he has lived in a psychiatric residential care facility. But he likes to come to his dad's small townhouse to read and watch TV. He calls it his sanctuary.

The fire was caused by someone disposing of a cigarette or some other smoking material in the area, fire officials said.

Devices that save time/labor/money (computers, e-mail, bringing your own lunch) have subtracted loads of calorie-burning activity from the workday during the past 30 years. That encourages a sit-down life -- going from bed to commute to desk to dinner table to TV to bed again. Staying parked on your gluteus maximus switches off a crucial enzyme that plays a big role in weight, waist size and health.
Homestead credit supporters, including Rawlings-Blake, say the program encourages city residents to stay in their homes rather than sell because of rising tax bills.

But the part Chandler has really perfected is Step Three, wherein he has become perhaps the Knicks’ most popular player. To borrow a term from baseball, he is a dirty-uniform player. He plays hard, he works referees hard (as his impressive collection of technical fouls can attest), he plays defense and is especially vocal from the bench. He has played through injuries — if we are to believe Anthony, one of those is a fractured left wrist, though Chandler denies it — and on Sunday he had to return to the locker room after hurting his elbow.
"It just means we were just that bad last year," guard Brian Waters said. "Our goal is to get to the next part of the season."

The Army must approve any civilian uses and won't decide on the level of cleanup that is needed until it does. For example, an industrial use would require less cleanup than a residential use.

We open with a quote tipping us off that this week's episode has its roots -- well, a few of them, anyway -- in the old Pied Piper of Hamelin tale. Fun fact: the pied piper tale is translated as Rattenfänger von Hameln in German. So says Wikipedia, at least. As we recall, the piper was hired to lure away rats with his piping, but when the Hamelin citizenry wouldn't pay him (a tax revolt?) he lured their children away, too.

The simple camps were friendly, warm and familial. We got to know the other guests at big, communal dinner tables. At one camp we got to play soccer with the staff on a vast field in the Serengeti before an audience of wildebeests. At another camp, we had impromptu spear-throwing and archery competitions with the kitchen staff. Two of the Maasai guides led my youngest son and me on spontaneous mock hunts - stalking our "prey" on foot through ravines and across streams. I can tell you that this is the definition of heaven for a 12-year-old boy, and for someone with the emotional maturity of one.

Sweeney did appoint Cimperman as chair of Health and Human Services, which, given its second-tier status, is like damning him with faint praise. It remains to be seen if Cimperman will simmer and stew or whether he will choose to use his connections and political skills to make Health and Human Services relevant in a city with world-class medical resources and, shockingly, even greater needs in the health care arena.

"Magicians love to cater to as large a market as possible," he said. "Comedians are specific to their own demographic, and every other level of performing arts is like that. But with magic it's different. Back in the 1950s and '60s, magicians still wore top hats and tuxes, going back as far as the 1880s. They didn't progress with the times.

Last month I stayed at the Fairmont Waterfront in Vancouver, British Columbia, where I could look down from my 20th-floor room and see six hives — and about half a million bees — in the center of a third-floor balcony herb garden. The bees quietly went about their business within 20 feet of the hotel pool and within 50 feet of the mammoth Vancouver Convention Centre. Meanwhile, I snacked on a selection of the hotel's delicate honey truffles, Bee's Knees. In the dining room, I found a small jar of honey on the table at breakfast.

I normally do not agree with Gov. Kasich, but applaud his idea to tax the shale oil and gas companies to finance a tax cut for Ohioans. Ohio receives a paltry amount of money from those that remove minerals from the ground. Other states are reaping a bountiful harvest for their citizens, but Ohio does not. Why?

They were extremely expensive to maintain. They were the most superb fighting force in the world at that time, something like supersonic fighter-bomber pilots in our day, where each man and his equipment costs a fortune to keep operational. A single mounted knight in France in the 13th century required the proceeds from 3,750 acres to equip and maintain himself, and for Templars operating overseas in the Holy Land, the costs were much greater since much had to be imported, not least their horses. The Templars' training, their armor, their horses, their squires, their sergeants, not to mention building and maintaining castles, required an enormous outlay. And the knights themselves could suffer high mortality rates in climactic battles and needed to be replaced. All these costs were met through donations from the faithful back in Europe, usually in the form of estates large and small as well as tithes from the Church.

Right now, for those of us over the age of 30, shorts should still be considered experimental and fun. Think, then, about buying a pair of the more outrageous shorts from Stella McCartney (Hawaiian-print cotton shorts, £570), Dries Van Noten (black and white desaturated floral print, £255), Carven (alpine-printed silk, £220) or Yves Saint Laurent (poppy-print crêpe shorts, £640). On top, keep it simple, and if you are worried about modesty and dignity, then keep it loose. Try a slightly oversized white shirt by Equipment (I like their silk tuxedo shirt for £255), Gap's dolman-sleeve white shirt (£29.95) or, if you want to really splash out, The Row's white, long cotton shirt (£610) is a great long-term wardrobe addition. The trick is to get the volume just right so that you look neither too "gym-ready" nor too blousy. T-shirts are fine, but they should be loose, round-necked and in very good cotton. A friend of mine swears by Iro, but I love tees by Gap ("Mason" crew, from £12.95), James Perse (from £65) and Petit Bateau (from £25). Flat shoes, please (a column on this is just around the corner); Bottega Veneta, Lanvin and Balenciaga are all good places to start.

Linda Wilson: The Hanley and I-70 interchange is a new interchange and with the curve in the road there is a slight jog. Part of this is also due to the sight distance we have to have for the inside lane next to the barrier wall around that curve. I will have someone check on the striping. Our striping efforts will begin again next spring. We restripe all of the interstates in the spring after the harsh winter weather. I'll see if they can make the jog a little smoother in the spring.

There's nothing wrong with making the ratiocinating resident of 221B Baker St. a brawling badass, if the filmmakers had also honored Holmes' uncanny talents for deductive reasoning, his powers of observation and forethought. But the intellectual side of Downey's Holmes is represented by not much more than show-off blather and far-fetched "reasoning." Not a keen mind so much as a careening script.

Much like Las Vegas itself, there is something charmingly blasphemous about Stratosphere Tower, the goofy yet more imposing reproduction of the Seattle Space Needle that peers over the Vegas strip. It's only fitting that Sin City's most visible landmark, which at 1,149 feet marks the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River and the fifth-tallest structure in the U.S., combines the kind of elegance and wackiness that has come to define Las Vegas.
That way, the math was simple: $4 worth of gas meant Scrawn, Vodi and Z each had to cough up $1 apiece to DJ.
Dewey Powers appears tableside in his shirt and tie and with deferential manner. He's the owner of Spinner's, a steak, seafood and chops restaurant along Highway 101. One reason he enjoys winter: Business slows enough that he can take a shift waiting tables and chat up guests. During summer tourists flock to eat and there's sometimes an hour wait for a table.

Questions to ponder while the Rams finally settle on their next general manager:
“John (Mara) and Steve (Tisch) tease me about having picked the Jets all the time,” Christie said. “That’s okay. I’m not here to be one of those politicians to go, “Oh, both teams should win.” New Jersey knows that’s not how I am. I made a choice and it’s not the first time I was wrong and it won’t be the last.”

Free-form disc jockeys -- that is, disc jockeys able to play anything they want, with no pressure from the station's management to do anything other than indulge their own tastes -- are exceedingly few and far between these days on commercial radio stations.

Well, almost. Things get pretty bad toward the end. The sick bag never got used, but it can't hurt to keep one handy (some people have reportedly walked out of some screenings). But "The Woman" isn't simply a gore-fest. It's just mostly a gore-fest, with a little more going on, as well.

Why we recommend passage: Traditionally excellent Hudson schools have made the money stretch and slashed $8.8 million in costs since the voters' last injection of new money, in 2006. Hudson teachers, among the highest-paid, on average, in Northeast Ohio, have tempered their salary growth, although they could do more.

In "Stony Island," Barge plays Percy Price, who mentors the Stony Island Band, a fusion of rock, blues and jazz, much like what Chicago's Earth, Wind & Fire and Chaka Khan were doing in the late 1970s.
