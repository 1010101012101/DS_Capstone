Modern man, surrounded by fast food, cheap calories, 24-hour grocery stores and all-you-can-eat buffets, faces the same dilemma: Our genes, fine-tuned to help us survive famine in a radically different environment hundreds of thousands of years ago, have stacked the deck against our health.
"I'm still juggling," said Houston, 46, in her studio aerie on a hill just south of Cornelius. Painting, she said, gives her time to be there for her husband and two elementary school-aged sons, to help with her husband's business, to remodel yet another house, learn Spanish, travel and teach. She also designs websites and consults with Oregon wineries -- when she has a few spare minutes.

In no way do I condone so-called bounty systems, but I'm also opposed to rushing to judgment, and I can't stand hypocrisy. The NFL's investigation into the New Orleans Saints' bounty program - and the media/fan reaction to it - certainly raises questions.

And whether it was in transition or patiently moving the ball in half-court sets, the Bengals were pretty much doing whatever they wanted to on the floor. From a Roberts’ powerful two-hand slam dunk to a 3-pointer by Winston Gray, it was all good for Benedictine who took the lead into the locker room at halftime, 27-13.
An adherent of the Chicano art movement that emerged in the 1960s, he made his name with bold murals celebrating indigenous Mexican culture with Aztec and Mayan symbols.

The festival was an immediate hit in L.A. and quickly became the city's marquee event for pedestrians and cyclists.
Which, in turn, created the monster that is the owner. Jones built a stadium (24) that looks like something out of Battlestar Galactica, and even though it can hold more than 100,000 fans, he had to add even more seats (25) for the Super Bowl. Those seats were condemned before the big game (26), just one of many screw-ups that made ice-crippled Dallas one of the worst host cities ever (27).
Maui is called the "Valley Isle," but let's face it — most tourists' topography is limited to beaches, beaches and more beaches. Maui has 81 of them.

Gene Wojciechowski, ESPN.com: "Final Four washout or first-time champion? Overpaid or underappreciated? One-and-done specialist or dynasty builder? There is no middle ground for Kentucky coach John Calipari. He either wins a national title against underdog Kansas or he doesn't. And if he doesn't, then the doubts and questions will begin to bubble to the surface throughout Big Blue Nation. Calipari will leave the Superdome in the wee hours of Tuesday morning as a failure or as the guy who led UK from the desert. Kentucky hasn't won one of these things since 1998 and Wildcats fans are tired of Final Four dry mouth."

Still, those itching for action in Washington may get their wish. Immigration groups and those who support enforcement-only measures say they will redouble lobbying efforts at the federal level.

4. It turns out that maybe second baseman Brandon Phillips won't re-sign with the Cincinnati Reds and join Jay Bruce as the long-term tandem in the Queen City. Over the past winter, we've written often here at Bird Land about how the Cardinals have potential to identify at least one more member of the "core" to join Holliday, Adam Wainwright, Jaime Garcia and Yadier Molina. The poll today, which you can find above under the picture, is simple: Phillips for the Cardinals' core, yes or no?

My companion on the second visit, truth be told, can be demanding. She likes wine made by pro golfers and, oddly, expects it to come in a clean glass.

LAUSD as well as the Community College District have and are in the process of installing solar panels at their facilities. All without Measure B. Notwithstanding the process in which it reached the ballot, I am opposed to it, as it creates a serious and risk laden charter amendment change giving the City Council and mayor a dubious power over future rate increase abilities. The lack of open bidding on installation creates a serious financial challenge to the residents of Los Angeles."

Fearing a loss of financial autonomy could affect the quality and character of the show, as well as being concerned that its money might be used for non-horse show purposes, the horse show refused to turn over its records and checkbook.

Zumwalt South continued to take it to Howell early in Game 2, moving out to a quick 8-4 advantage. However, helped by some stellar hitting and blocking by Cybularz, the Vikings were able to go on a 9-2 run to take the lead, and they never trailed again as they evened up the match.

The state Teacher Standards and Practices Commission eventually revoked Cushing’s license in January 2005. He went on to teach at a charter school in Tucson, Ariz., in the 2006-07 school year and drew no complaints or reprimands there, administrators said.

On the radar: Adjoining the newly christened Hotel Modera, the dining room's clean lines and comfortable furnishings offer an impression of restrained elegance. Neutral-toned wood and leather dominate the room. Nondescript music slips from the sound system. Spot lighting is discreet, supplemented by blue, gray, gold and orange fixtures. The ultimate vibe is one of conscious restraint, as though owner David Machado, whose roots are deep in hotel food service, took pains to avoid offense to anyone.
Favorite local hangouts include Teddy's Bigger Burgers, with its '50s theme, and Buzz's, an indoor-outdoor steakhouse and 48-year institution.

In the long-run, regular exercise will help strengthen your lungs and heart, two of your most important sexual organs. Exercise can also help prevent obesity, a condition that could potentially mess with hormones -- and your sex drive. As Rowland explains it, fat cells in men tend to secrete estrogen, the female sex hormone. The consequences of extra estrogen in men aren't clear, but the hormone could conceivably dampen a man's sex drive as well as his ability to perform, he says.
"We are involved in so many technologies the government is interested in," Gross said after a Tuesday morning event at the National Press Club where representatives from industry, academia and the federal government said the three sectors need to collaborate on a comprehensive strategy to reduce nationwide energy use.

øWhen I'm hunting for white tail (deer) I use a bow. It's not as much sport with a rifle up where I'm from. There's so many hunters, the deer run in front of me, the next guy and the next guy, they don't have a chance if we use a rifle. The bow makes it a little more challenging. You have to get a lot closer because shots are 25 to 35 yards. It's more intense to be that close to the animal and not have him know I'm there, and then take my shot when I'm ready.
A motive and suspects in the shootings are under investigation by the department’s Major Crimes unit, he said.

TRANSFER TO DELTA. Delta is currently running a promotion for first-time transfers: Transfer AmEx points to Delta with a 50 percent bonus; transfer 100,000 or more points and also get 25,000 miles toward elite status. If you haven't transferred points before, this is an intriguing offer -- especially if you can transfer enough to get the 25,000 elite miles. Without any prior elite miles at all, that's enough for Delta's first "silver" elite level, which means some benefits:

After replacing coach Terry Murray with Darryl Sutter at midseason, Los Angeles finished the regular season with a 9-2-3 push, earning a playoff spot right before its 81st game.

The tale of her sudden fame is the stuff of writers’ fantasies — a nerdy version of Lana Turner being discovered on a soda fountain stool.

I would never bring them home, and I can't fathom a 21-year-old wanting a serious, long-term relationship with someone old enough to be his mother - and I can't say that's what I'd want either - but is it wrong to consider dating them? They're fun to be with, and sex isn't going to be in the equation. I made that clear on day one. I didn't sleep around when I was 20, and I have no intentions of starting now.
