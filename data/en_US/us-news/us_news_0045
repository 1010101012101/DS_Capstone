Legislation introduced late last month by Sen. Joe Pennacchio (R-Morris) places some of the burden on the future unemployed. The bill, which formalizes Gov. Chris Christie’s earlier proposal, would reduce weekly unemployment checks by $50 to a maximum of $550. Furloughed employees would take a big hit because the law would include a one-week waiting period for people receiving benefits. It would prevent such employees from collecting unemployment during the first week they are out of work.

In Mamet's view, Roosevelt's inadequacies are analogous to Barack Obama's, primarily the bailout of Chrysler and GM.

(3) Accepting that proximity won't make you close. This is the one you hinted around, but I'll just say it: If you talk to your parents and stand up for your wife and still your parents mistreat her, then you need to release your wife from your kumbaya expectations.

But (and it's a very important but) support for the death penalty, in Connecticut and elsewhere, is not as robust as it looks. When Quinnipiac asked a different question  "Which punishment do you prefer for people convicted of murder, the death penalty or life in prison with no chance of parole?"  only 46 percent favored the death penalty. An equal number chose life without parole. Death penalty opponents have an opening they haven't had for some time.
"The criminal-justice process many times can victimize a victim all over again," Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi told the crowd. He noted that prosecutors' offices used to have very little contact with a victim's family, in terms of informing them about the judicial steps in the process or preparing them about what to expect. The victim-witness units filled that void. "What a change has occurred from what it was 25 years ago."

The wood block idea was inspired by my 7-year-old son, Mack, who was stacking wood in the backyard and doing it wrong. It looked sort of like what you would end up with if you were playing a game of Jenga, kind of airy, more sculptural than structural. And it occurred to me that would be a good idea for the new place. So I took a few photos and showed them to Mark, with the original thought of using actual pieces of firewood. That had a feel that was a little too lodge-y and rustic, so we switched it over to the rough lumber pieces for a more modern feel.

The airport checkpoint as we know it today sprang into existence in spring 2002, over a month and a half at Baltimore/Washington International airport.

A team of management consultants from Accenture delved into the minutiae of checkpoint activity at BWI: How long did it take to pass from one point to another? How did the behavior of travelers affect line speed? How were people interacting with the equipment?

One problem with this strategy is that those laws are barely adequate to police misuse of large sums by politicians running for office, much less politicians running around.

If Mr. Abbas can capitalize on the regional developments in political Islam sparked by the Arab Spring and exert a moderating influence on Hamas' extremism, he could do much more to realize his goals than he ever could have achieved through his end-run to the UN.

I’ve never worried about being upstaged. I do it every night on stage with my band. When you surround yourself with unbelievable talent, you kind of assume there’s going to be upstaging.
--2B Will Rhymes and RHP Jeff Niemann played together in youth-league ball and for Lamar High School in Houston,, and they were reunited Thursday. Rhymes, called up following 3B Evan Longoria's injury, was at second base with Niemann starting. "I was standing out there thinking about that today," Rhymes said. "We started playing together when we were like 13 -- we were on all the same teams, Pony League and all-star teams and all through high school and stuff. That was awhile ago now, and it's pretty special to stand out there behind him and try to make plays for him."
The top prospects: There isn't a Ndamukong Suh or Marcell Dareus-type talent who will go in the first two or three picks, but LSU's Michael Brockers, Mississippi State's Fletcher Cox and Penn State's Devon Still look like sure-fire first-rounders. Dontari Poe of Memphis is a massive space-eater at nose tackle. North Carolina's Quinton Coples and South Carolina's Melvin Ingram are two of the top defensive end prospects in this draft.

Vera Sweeney, 34, co-owner of a company that manages several websites for women, says she eats "like a child"—that is, mostly chicken and pasta. Her husband, though, has eaten chicken hearts, sweetbreads, frog's legs, escargot and goat. "And of course he doesn't just eat it," says Ms. Sweeney, who lives with him in Garden City, N.Y.

During NRBQ's relentless touring schedule — they often logged 250 shows a year — Ardolino projected the image of the world's happiest bus driver. Under a mass of long, black curly hair and peering out from behind a grizzly beard and mustache, Ardolino bounced atop the stool of his drum kit as he pounded out sultry shuffles, effervescent swing beats, insistent rock and slinky R&B pulses, country two-steps or intricate jazz polyrhythms that anchored his fellow players' flights of musical fancy.

But what if the Americans who hold these beliefs are not, in fact, clear-eyed observers of the world scene stripped of its anti-imperial mystifications? Instead, what if they are people who have fallen for the same self-delusion that the British ruling class entertained before World War I, which was that their empire was so essential to world stability and, at least when compared with the alternatives and with empires past, so just that its hegemony could and would weather all challenges?

If employees are late to this meeting, often called a "daily scrum," they sometimes must sing a song like "I'm a Little Teapot," do a lap around the office building or pay a small fine, says Mike Cohn, president of Mountain Goat Software, Lafayette, Colo., an Agile consultant and trainer. If someone is rambling on for too long, an employee may hold up a rubber rat indicating it is time to move on. Companies make exceptions to their no-sitting rules if a worker is sick, injured or pregnant—but usually not for workers outside the office telecommuting on Skype.

"Season of the Witch" is made up of three parts: Enchantment, Terror and Deliverance. Part One is the most fun, with its chapters on how Chronicle Executive Editor Scott Newhall turned a once-drab newspaper into "The Daily Circus" of the 1950s and 1960s; on "The Free City" of the proto-hippie movement the Diggers; and Talbot's account of early drag queens and the outrageous, LSD-fueled gender-bending chorus line that was the Cockettes.

This juxtaposition of classic Asian ingredients and focused preparations follows through the 17 courses, where some of Lee's highly refined combinations make few concessions to the American palate. He takes the authentic textures of Asian ingredients, mixes them with his Western training, and gives everything a breathtaking twist. No other four-star chef is so in tune with the Asian culture and uses it to inform every aspect of the experience.

Bad omen: A bipartisan decision by the Senate ethics committee to hire an outside counsel to investigate Nevada's John Ensign will only increase GOP pressure on him to step aside in 2012. Ensign, who once fancied himself as White House material, points out that the Justice Department declined to indict him, but that's not stopping his own colleagues, who hadn't brought in an outside ethics help in more than 20 years. Ensign has admitted to having an affair with a former aide's wife who was also on his staff. After Ensign fired the couple, his parents paid them almost $100,000 and he allegedly helped set them up as lobbyists. His poll numbers back home have cratered and GOP recruiters wish he'd go away and give Rep. Dean Heller a clear shot at the nomination (though after 2010, the establishment might not be able to get anyone a clear shot). Democrats see Nevada as one of their few chances to add a Senate seat in 2012 and are pushing Rep. Shelly Berkley to make the race.

Since the case broke, 30 have pleaded guilty, four have been convicted, two were acquitted, one died and charges have been dropped against four — among them, former Democratic Assemblyman Louis Manzo, who was accused of taking more than $20,000 from Dwek to grease the skids for a development project in Jersey City.
"If you are a black man with dignity then you need to learn the facts!" he shouted to Williams, a long-respected voice in Newark education and head of the Abbot Leadership Institute.
Will win: Perry is out of her league. And as much as I admire Lady Gaga, "The Fame Monster" really amounts to a glorified EP. The buzz is that Eminem, who leads this year's hopefuls with 10 nominations, is in line for some major Grammy love. But if Steely Dan could trounce the chart-topping rapper in this same category 10 years ago, I wouldn't put it past Lady Antebellum this time.
The next morning, our pummeled bodies tell us we have overdone it, so we engage Plan B, perfect for those not-so-great weather or just-plain-tired days (or in-need-of-shopping-therapy days). Plan B is the factory outlet Mecca of North Conway 9 miles away, which offers state-tax-free shopping entertainment at L.L. Bean, Carhartt, J. Crew and all the other usual suspects.

What you should expect is a series finale that's everything "Rescue Me" has been for seven ambitious seasons: shocking, tender, tragic, loud, reverent, profane, hilarious, harrowing, infuriating, inspiring, exhilarating and exhausting.
Here's a summary of the teams who won the final three games to win a series, 4-3:

The Magic throttled the Pistons for their second consecutive win after days of turmoil, beating them while undermanned. It's a shame that the story line couldn't be controversy-free.

“It’s funny, because of the bands I’m best known for, I’ve always been considered a New York musician,” says Bert, whose resume as one of indie rock’s premier drummers includes stints with noise-rock pioneers Sonic Youth, garage-rock gods Pussy Galore, and retro-rock revivalists the Chrome Cranks. “But I’ve lived in Hoboken most of my life, and I’m not going anywhere anytime soon.”
Beane traded talented starters and fan favorites, Trevor Cahill and Gio Gonzalez. He also traded All-Star closer Andrew Bailey.
Experts seem to agree that there are six elite players at the top of this draft. The No. 6 slot might lose some value to the Rams if cornerback Morris Claiborne or running back Trent Richardson fell to that spot after Blackmon and Matt Kalil. The Rams already have veterans in the lead RB and CB roles, so that might prompt the front office to trade down out of the pick for additional assets. Or the Rams could move up IF the football staff falls in love with Blackmon. How the staff assesses these high-end prospects during the weeks ahead should help Jeff Fisher and Les Snead chart their course.
It's little wonder that L.A. voters and ratepayers, most of whom can only dream of getting the gold-plated retirement packages and high salaries that are awarded to DWP workers, resent the City Council's frequent votes to raise utility rates. They were hit again Wednesday when the council approved a 2.9% hike for water rates, and even steeper annual increases are planned for the next three years. Yet for all the justified populist outrage, there's still a genuine need to raise DWP rates. DWP salaries are built into the utility's operating expenses, but the current rate hikes are needed to pay rising capital costs connected with higher prices for water and electricity, meeting federal and state standards for drinking water and switching to renewable power. Failure to approve the rate increases could result in fines costing ratepayers more than the increases.
The judge’s tongue-lashing came after the 41-year-old witness, who has a criminal history spanning 28 years, said he didn’t know whether he could get his sentence reduced if he cooperated with federal authorities. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Minish jumped to his feet, telling Martini, "I think Mr. Bergin’s being a little disingenuous."
The wolf dog hybrid named Chief - once ordered destroyed for aggressive behavior - will become a guard dog at Louisiana's maximum security prison.
The State Department simply didn't have the time, Mr. Obama the alleged red-tape cutter lamented, to check every box on its mountains of triplicated forms. The eight-volume environmental impact statement cogitates on the possible spreading of "137 federally restricted and regulated noxious weeds," as well as an unspecified number of "state and local noxious weeds." By all means, let's hold up a massive infrastructure project that will cost taxpayers nothing and create bountiful jobs and tax revenues so we can check -- again! -- that local noxious weeds don't gain the upper hand (upper leaf?).
After three months, the couple moved in together. In June, Quintero popped the question. The couple bought wedding bands and booked a pastor. She found a simple but elegant V-neck dress, and they set the date for Sept. 23, Quintero’s birthday. But last month, one week before their wedding day, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested the 40-year-old mechanic at the Elizabeth auto shop where he works.
"I think it was good," he said. "We didn't have many penalties today. We had a few off-sides and one offensive holding."

Both works look fresh to our eye even though it's been a century or more since their artists put brush to palette; they also continue to exert exceptionally wide appeal. Grandparents, parents and young children can enjoy these paintings together, no doubt in different ways but nevertheless en famille.
“He was fine yesterday,” Girardi said. “For whatever reasons, the symptoms came today.”
The industry pretty much languished for 300 years. Even 20 years ago, Mexican wines were nothing to boast about. But now a new breed of ambitious winemakers is gearing up to satisfy the demand of a rising, affluent and increasingly sophisticated domestic middle class. And the international market is starting to pay attention. Consumers have begun to recognize the dramatic improvement in quality.
The new work on view will be "Home," by hip-hop choreographer Rennie Harris. Set to gospel house music, it was inspired by stories submitted to the "Fight HIV Your Way" contest of people living with or affected by HIV. It debuted in New York on Dec. 1, 2011, marking both World AIDS DAY and the 22nd anniversary of AIley's death from the disease.
The agreement still has to go through internal reviews in both countries and to be signed by the Afghan and American presidents.
"It's kind of our evolution. We have local hero Ray Jr., Bone Thugs, David Banner and The Kickdrums on the mixtape, and it's a sound that's very club based, which is different from what we've done before. When we started, we were more neo-jazz and hip-hop."
As is, members of Congress and the president aren't expected to address Taxmageddon until after the Nov. 6 election. We wonder how many of them will be distracted by movers loading their possessions into trucks for the long ride home.

Although he has only been in the kitchen since Easter, the results are impressive, starting with a range of raw vegetables accompanied by an intensely smoky baba ganoush, the existing Petersham brand of extra virgin olive oil and pita bread. The experience only gets better with his signature spiced rabbit and chorizo with parsnip and skordalia (a Greek garlic and potato dip), all covered with grumolo verde chicory. The best dish of all was a large duck bistayeea, a delicious pastry-covered pie with layers of duck and Moroccan spices, which was partially inspired by a dish Ms. Gyngell served using pigeons. These, and his other dishes like braised fennel with Turkish chili and walnut crumbs, or an exquisite slow-cooked lamb shoulder, were executed with considerable skill and rigor.

No matter how magnificent the dunes, it was time to counteract a week of rough motels and dusty all-day drives with a little luxury. There are few better places in Africa to do this than the area around Sossusvlei, home to some of the continent's ritziest hide-outs. The priciest of all, Wolwedans — a resort composed of several lodges and ultra-luxurious tent camps — is rumored to have refused Brangelina and their entourage rather than rebook its other guests. Cheaper but still wonderful is the Sossus Dune Lodge, which provides the easiest access to the famous dunes.

And how Freudenberger keeps the chapters moving is a mystery of perpetual motion: Waiting for a visa, waiting for a green card, waiting for a job, waiting for a citizenship test — these bureaucratic delays should be no more entertaining than standing in line, but in this lucidly plotted novel, they seem like high drama.
After wandering through the Plaza Machado, sneaking looks into private courtyards, I peaked into the recently restored Teatro de Angela Peralta (you may know it as the Opera House), where Handel's "Messiah" was playing. In the ballet studio next door, 21 teenage girls and one boy in toe shoes were at the bar, practicing their routines. As the pianist banged out a tune, the maestro herself — stern and imposing — went from one to the next, raising a leg higher there and arching an arm back here. The scene spoke of a tranquil lifestyle. But it didn't mean I had forgotten to stay alert.
There are just hours to go for the play-in round of The Plain Dealer and cleveland.com's first Pizza Playoffs. Around 2 p.m. today, the ballots will shut down. Out of almost 300 restaurants nominated, only 64 will move one to compete to be named the best in the region.

Third, and best, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson joins the cast as a ruthless federal manhunter whose task force is assigned to nab Dom and Brian at any cost. Imagine if Tommy Lee Jones' team from "The Fugitive" spent three hours a day pumping iron and 25 hours a day glistening, and you're starting to get the idea. Between this and last year's overlooked "Faster," it's great to see The Rock re-embracing the action genre, and when his clobbering match with Diesel finally happens, it's as outlandishly room-wrecking as I'd hoped.

I hope your parents are supportive. They (and you) should call a meeting immediately with the administration of your school to insist that this name-calling must end. If your parents aren't helpful, seek out a sympathetic teacher or counselor. The teacher needs to apologize for her behavior and change her ways. Otherwise she should not be teaching.
When herb grower Jan Becker created a spiral several years ago at her Becker's Cottage Garden Herb Farm in Springfield Township, Ohio, she found the design made harvesting difficult. She said that when she made the spiral big enough to accommodate larger plants like basil, she discovered those plants blocked her access to other herbs. She also thought the design used more soil than a raised-bed garden and was attractive only when the plants were lush.

There are two main Whitney routes: Up and Down, the standard 22-mile roundtrip, going in and out the same steep trail, which is what most people do. Or you can do what we did, and what the big kids do, which is to go Up and Over, starting at a distant trailhead, hiking a giant horseshoe-shaped route, and coming down the main trail. We would carry our packs and our body weight up a total of 8,320 feet, according to my cumulating altimeter watch.

But here's the thing about long toss: While the kids are devoted to it, the sport's elders aren't so sure. Some of them think these pitchers may be destroying their arms.

"The New World" will of course include music, but it's not a musical, maybe St. Louis' theatergoers favorite form. (Thank you, Muny!) But the spring has plenty to offer that way, including two new shows at the Fox, the Broadway hit "Memphis" and the new show about competitive cheerleading, "Bring It On."

It means Summit is so proud of this one it doesn't ever want it to go away. Summit Saga is a West Coast-style IPA that will hits bars and stores next week. To celebrate, Summit will have a beer dinner Tuesday at the Uptown Cafeteria (6 p.m., $65) and a release party Wednesday at Sea Salt Eatery (6 p.m.). The brewery will also celebrate the recent release of its new seasonal brew, Summit Summer Ale, which replaces Hefe Weizen.
American Greetings said the measure will be an important factor in its final decision on whether to stay or leave.
By September 2001, the Latin pop boom was peaking.
