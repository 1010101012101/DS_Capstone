The cynical explanation for this sudden interest in ethics is that Senator Miller is throwing up a smoke screen to distract attention if, as many expect, Senator Currie is allowed to remain in the legislature with nothing more than a reprimand or censure. But all legislators, even those who think they are untainted by the stain that surrounds Senator Currie, need to take this effort seriously. They will likely be in a position during the next three months to decide whether to ask Marylanders to pay more for the services they receive, and taxpayers are going to be much less willing to accept that if they have any doubt that legislators are trustworthy stewards of the common good.
The S&P 500 Index is constructed so that each stock influences the index in proportion to its "market capitalization." That is the price of the stock times the number of shares outstanding. So it's the total value of the company that influences the index, not just the price of its stock. And if a company decides to split its stock, its market capitalization remains the same. In the case of a split, there are twice as many shares, each trading at half the original price. So the "influence" of the company in the index is unchanged.

R.C. was also familiar with the individualist-anarchist ideas of the 19th Century libertarians for he referred to having read Benjamin Tuckers Instead Of A Book in a column which appeared in the Gazette Telegraph on May 8, 1955. In discussing "Anarchy - Good or Bad" R.C. was trying to get at the point that sometimes anarchy meant "self-rule" and other times meant "no rules" at all. He was in favor of everyone controlling him or herself and not being subjected to coercive forces outside the self. He was opposed to the absence of self-rule, because he believed that its absence would lead to chaos.

"They are deliberately invoking Senate Bill 5 and Kasich's name to stir up controversy," Turner said. "Just because Gov. Kasich may support this plan doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad plan.

A massive shortfall in customer cash — perhaps $1.2 billion or more, according to the broker’s bankruptcy trustee — has dogged efforts to unwind the firm and sparked separate probes by the FBI and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission into alleged violations of federal laws on segregated client accounts. The House Agriculture Committee is one of four congressional bodies that oversees the CFTC, which was the primary regulator of MF Global’s futures business.
The twin-turbo V8 is blindingly fast. A "sport+" mode raises performance to a level that -- like the car's 190-m.p.h. top speed -- should only be used on closed tracks.

The U.S. Postal Service plans to move its retail operations to Westfield Downtown Plaza from its historic 801 I St. location in July, the agency announced.
As things stand, the region could not build the entire list of mass transit requests under this referendum. Currently the transit requests are nearly double the amount of money expected to come from the tax. Furthermore, the region has already set a general guideline to spend a lot of the tax on roads and other projects. And the simple fact is that the vast majority of metro Atlantans — the voters who will make the final decision — choose to travel primarily by car.
Two Ficano appointees, Tahir Kazmi and Zayd Allebban, were charged in a federal criminal complaint this month with extortion, theft and obstruction of justice.

All of this (and the growing assumption that Jerusalem won’t wait for a US “green light” for a wider military operation) makes a military-averse Obama administration rather uneasy about Israel’s next move. A bold maneuver in the Gulf now could help regain some trust in Jerusalem and lead to better coordination with Washington.

A tax at that level is a virtual invitation to produce as much as possible overseas. If companies send their profits back to the good ol' U.S.A., they get whacked at the U.S. rate  even after those same profits have been taxed by the host country. Most countries don't do that. Profit is taxed in the country where it is made, although some countries apply a small levy if it's repatriated.
Inglis of Floyd's Coffee and other shop owners who work with Stumptown said they wouldn't necessarily be thrilled to know a New York firm was calling the shots in Portland.

Letting the city through this board tell any owner of any property what he can and can't do with it might be fine if only the owner is allowed to seek historic designation. Currently, studies required by the California Environmental Quality Act can trigger a review. Or the Historic Resources Board itself, plus the mayor, the City Council or any member of the public can request a historical review. A homeowner, then, may lose total control of his home because a stranger sought historical status for it.

Most disappointing airplane: Boeing 787. The Dreamliner's rollout has been a nightmare for Boeing. Dozens should be flying by now, but the first delivery has been pushed back to this summer. Two years ago, the company looked brilliant as the humongous A380 built by its only major competitor, Airbus, struggled with slow sales. But Boeing's vast supply chain and design problems have pushed back the 787's delivery date seven times. The plane of the future seems perpetually stuck in the future.
Browns backer: Commissioner Roger Goodell again said the Browns did not warrant any disciplinary action for allowing Colt McCoy to return to the field after suffering a concussion during the Pittsburgh game.

The Rangers point out their preseason conditioning preparation as one reason for such continued fitness.

In the interest of full-disclosure, I've never been to a sand-sculpting festival, but judging from the images at the event's Web site, ArtofSandUS.com, the creations of these world-class international masters headed to this event look more like MC Escher prints than the kind of bucket-formed stuff I used slop together with my kids.

"I don't blame the coaches," Jones said. "They're looking for a way, I mean, we're trying to win games. They wanted every ball punted out of bounds. They basically didn't want a punt return to cost us another game. That's totally understandable. It's just a difficult task every time you get in there to punt the ball out of bounds, and still get a good yardage out of it."

When he walks through the handsome dining room, all eyes turn toward him. A woman at the table next to me practically drooled as he came up to say hello to her. Turns out she's a die-hard fan, and he just made her decade. Through the night I heard several other tables ask if he were here, not seeing him in the partially open kitchen. On just about every occasion, he came out to say hello.

Here’s all we really need to know about the voters’ attitude toward hip-hop: In 2005 Kanye West lost in the Best New Artist category to Maroon 5. Hey, I love Maroon 5, too; I think it’s a great traditionalist funk-rock band. But the Grammys decided that “She Will Be Loved” represented a more promising future for popular music than “Jesus Walks.” It’s hard to humor a forecast as tone-deaf as that.
The outcome of the hearing was never in doubt as Democrats control the Senate 20-15 and a similar bill last year attracted three Republican votes.

To my mind, this is exactly what the festival is all about - a chance for all of us who speak English to claim our birthright, the poetry of William Shakespeare. And another plus. Marcy and I have been doing "shows" together all our lives, whether we had an audience or not. But this was the first time that Jordan and I ever did.

They finished second at the worlds two years ago; they have a very disciplined and well-coached team. Regardless of who we have in our opening pool, we're still going to have to get through a lot of very good teams if we want to win gold," he said.

A great deal of thoughtful consideration went into the preparation of "Here Is Our Policy" and it was subjected to ongoing revision as the years passed. As LeFevre became more involved in the writing of editorials for the Gazette Telegraph, he saw his role in the Freedom Newspapers as pivotal in keeping the paper in Colorado Springs in the forefront of libertarian thinking. The masthead of LeFevre's paper read "Colorado's Most Consistent Newspaper" and it was Harry Hoiles' desire that LeFevre write consistently on the themes of human liberty and human freedom. The masthead went on to conclude:

øA: It was too early then, but in 1999, the idea was you had to have a big computer called a server, then you had to build a network, then you had to have fancy complicated storage. Then there's a software stack underneath that of databases and other technology. That worked OK, but when the Internet came along, and the number of people using something went from 100,000 at the high end in the largest companies to 800 million or a billion, then it became harder to keep the same infrastructure in place. Companies had to figure out how to get that scale themselves. What cloud computing says is, all that infrastructure is taken care of for you. The cloud handles all the complicated bits of how the hardware works, how to scale it, how to grow from very small to very big, and the price has dropped 100 fold in 10 years.

1., 2. and 3. Leave the refs alone. He has earned the reputation of being a whiner and complainer for the past few years. The refs have proven that they do not like it and they will not tolerate it from him. What has he learned from this experience? NOTHING!!! His behavior is counterproductive. He has more techs than any other player in the league. They are not changing their behavior. He MUST change his behavior. Then, maybe, he will start to get some more favorable calls. But, if not, then at least he will not cost his team extra points in games and he will not be suspended games. He obviously does not care about the huge amount of money his suspensions have cost him. It is his choice.

If the court ultimately rules that President Obama's healthcare reform law is unconstitutional, it will be a reversal even bigger than Brown and Lawrence. And there will be no comforting consensus that the court has finally got it right. Ever since Wickard vs. Filburn (1942), with only a couple of minor exceptions, the courts have upheld the use of federal power under the commerce clause, which gives the federal government the authority to regulate commerce. Even the 1964 Civil Rights Act is considered constitutional as a regulation of commerce.

So what is "The Angel Esmeralda," then, code or catalog? The answer is that it is both. DeLillo is among the most consistent of writers; his books are like installments in one ongoing novel, an inquiry into the confusion and intractability of contemporary life. What seemed, at one time, prescient — the tension between pop idolatry and rock 'n' roll iconoclasm that marks "Great Jones Street" (1973), the recognition of extremism as a social force in "Players" (1977) and "Running Dog" (1978) — has become common currency.

At the state level, the acolytes of Mr. Norquist and Arthur Laffer have been somewhat constrained by balanced budget requirements and limitations on state debt. But a way has been found around these. Spending has been enhanced by swelling pensions and employee retirement benefits, which do not immediately impact current budgets. Restrictions on state debt have been evaded through revenue bond financing, the revenues pledged no longer being third-party payments but future general fund appropriations. The most spectacular demonstration of this was the sale and leaseback of the Arizona state capitol, by a Republican administration, but the Democrats are not far behind. The chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association, Martin O'Malley, has successively proposed to finance a state transportation headquarters building, a state health laboratory and a state office complex through revenue bond issuances supported by pledges of extravagant future rent payments from the state general fund.

A long shelf of solid rock lay across its entrance, but it was acting as a breakwater, the waves sloshing across it and making for a relatively placid stretch of water just before the cleft's mouth.

Checkerboard panels of chocolate brown horsehair cover the back wall, the orange banquette featuring a dramatic curved back that reaches halfway up the wall. The space between the tall paned windows overlooking the plaza is covered in a subtle print fabric; another wall is wallpapered in dark woven grass. An open-mesh cane partition shields the large opening to the kitchen so diners can catch glimpses of food preparation, but aren't bombarded by the clank of pans and the shouts of cooks. While there's always a lively din, care has been taken to mute the harsher sounds so diners can focus on the conversation.

Meanwhile, there is "Pina," which offers intimate cinematic evidence of Bausch's poetry, both in her strikingly natural ensemble arrangements and in the personal power of solo movement, the dancers' limbs employed to reach not just the belly but scratch and flutter their way into the soul. "Pina" features choice comments from Bausch and the dancers, along with cagily restaged works that make great use of Wuppertal's scenic Ruhr Valley environs. But mostly it studies a few works with extended excerpts, including "Cafe Muller," from 1978, in which the dancers often seem to run about willy-nilly but where, in fact, Wenders' artful filming reveals deep, disturbing patterns of fear and frantic dislocation — major Bausch themes.

We’re moving into a new home and hope to build a wine cellar in the stone basement. Getting 150 bottles of wine from 150 guests would certainly kick start our collection, but I wondered if it was tacky to ask for booze to stockpile in the basement.

Oddly, Mr. Roenneberg finds little fault in the priorities of our 24/7 lifestyle, for which repose represents, at best, a necessary evil. Among other modern trends, he might have also noted the transition, during the Industrial Revolution, from bi-phasic sleep—in which people rested in two discrete segments—to the compressed, consolidated slumber to which we aspire today (not always successfully). However coveted eight hours of straight sleep may be, many "insomniacs" who stir in the middle of the night might feel less anxious if informed that segmented slumber bears a provenance dating to Homer's "Odyssey."

Early on came the reminder that having famous parents means being subject to the peanut gallery. Not only did many tweets pan the baby's name, but "Illuminati's Very Youngest" -- a stab at the significance of "Ivy" -- also became a popular term on Twitter, poking fun at Jay-Z, some jokingly (others not) having charged with him with some kind of involvement in a hypothetical, conspiratorial group.

Al-Qaida's once-extensive training camps in Afghanistan have long been obliterated and the group's presence in the country is minimal.

Officials said the weekend's weather -- which included winds that knocked down hundreds of trees and damaged power lines -- as "the worst storm in PSE&G history." Some 458,000 of the company's customers lost electricity at some point.
The concern for Chen – really, for anyone who has pitched exclusively as a pro in Japan – is how he adjusts to pitching every fifth day instead of every sixth. The Orioles were careful to spread out his starts early, but he threw on four days rest Sunday. That likely will be the norm for much of the rest of the season. So far, so good. But it is a long year, and pitching so often can be a huge challenge.
Since I teach sixth-grade science, I value Jake's window into the world of middle-school students. Now I asked him, should I enforce the no-hat rule as it applies to hoodies? I have two kids who like to wear them. They are both white. One wears his hood up out of shyness, I think; the other because he likes to rebel, and it seems a fairly mild form of rebellion, one that heads off more outrageous behavior at the pass.
Will he vote against raising the salaries and/or fringe benefits of the same people - the paramedics union - that put him in office? It is a stretch to believe his objectivity won't be compromised.
When he was still alive, Jackson was a big fan of Cirque du Soleil, and regularly took his family to see the company's shows. It would seem a natural fit for Cirque to create a show honoring his musical legacy. Instead, "The Immortal World Tour" shows how big of a creative vacuum was created by his untimely death – one that's impossible for mimes, contortionists and acrobats to fill.

As the tournament approached, the pace of fabrication picked up to nearly seven days a week, often well into the evening, until they had their completed, but untested, robot only 12 hours before their first scheduled match. They left the Terra Nova practice field well after midnight, still unable to drive up this year's ramp, swapped out a pair of motors back in their shop, and went to bed feeling pretty mediocre about their chances. A few hours later during field inspection, they discovered those motors were the last bit of troubleshooting required and their robot was working as designed.

The way Gavin says "uncomfortable hip roll" makes me laugh even while I wonder how many different hats this man owns. We see a long segment of Gavin at a recent concert, interacting with the crowd, exhorting them to vote for him and then he devotes this dance to him. They're doing the samba to Harry Belafonte's " Sweetheart from Venezuela," always a fun song. Gavin seems way more relaxed this week, maybe a week of not being in the bottom two did wonders for his confidence. Oops, spoke too soon, he lost his place there a little bit toward the end. Bruno said he enjoyed it and that Gavin let himself go for it. Carrie Ann is laughing as she says it was lacking a little bit of form and Gavin quips that, "It was more of a struggle than a samba." Len calls it a "sham-ba" and then soaks up the audience boos, before calling the dance a "gallant effort."

Alyssa Rapp, founder and CEO of Bottlenotes, a popular online wine site where members can learn about, rate and buy wines, hasn't yet tried Be. wines, but she sees the approach as "helping to demystify wine, combating the stereotype of wine being an incredibly stodgy, intimidating, pretentious industry."

Having to scale back services is tough, Berman says, because hunger doesn't take days off. A boost in operating funds -- the center gets the rest of its funding from private foundations, businesses, individuals and the faith community -- would help put Wednesdays back on the schedule, giving clients another day of refuge that they can't find anywhere else.
Nobody could argue that THF Realty needs tax subsidies to build a Walmart. One of the partners is Stan Kroenke. Last year, Forbes put his net worth at $2.7 billion.

This frothy plot is lifted by witty dialogue and Porter's timeless score. It's packed with such hits as "You're the Top," "I Get a Kick Out of You," "It's De-Lovely," "Let's Misbehave," "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" and, of course, the title song. In fact, "Anything Goes" set the standard by which all future Porter shows would be judged. They were often found falling short of this early peak.

4Martini glass: The quintessential cocktail glass holds "up drinks" - those shaken or stirred with ice, then strained. The stem keeps your hand from warming the liquid, and everyone looks good drinking one. (Except children, of course - they tend to spill.) As for the traditional V-shaped model, after plenty of colored and twisted stems, designers are adding more subtle touches, like the tapered top on the Schott-Zwiesel martini glass. Some vintage-themed bars are starting to use the Champagne coupe (not very good for Champagne anyway) instead. Coupes often hold under 5 ounces, like martini glasses from the old days, and are best used for drinks with only alcohol.

For many of us living in the city, our most intimate contact with nature is seeing how birds find places to nest as if the urban landscape were their forest. In "My Baby Blue Jays" (Viking: $16.99, ages 5-8), John Berendt, author of the (adult) bestseller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," turns his captivating storytelling powers to the family of bluejays that took up residence outside his New York apartment window. He began photographing them when the blue jay and his wife (no scientific terms in this book!) bring in their first scrap of nesting material, and followed their offspring until they stepped out on their own ("As he fell, he fluttered his wings frantically. Not enough to fly, just enough to slow his fall a little"). His patient observation shows how close a novelist's eye can be to Jane Goodall's scientific rigor.
