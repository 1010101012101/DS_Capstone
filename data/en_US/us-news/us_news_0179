Over the long term, a national energy policy that includes things like fuel efficiency standards, bio-energy and efforts to produce more domestic energy is also needed. For today though, limiting excessive Wall Street speculation won't take us back to the days of $1.00 gas, but it will help limit the pump price pain.

This time, Kalmar will take Storm Large, the Portland rock singer, to perform Kurt Weill's "Seven Deadly Sins" with the orchestra. Large is no classical singer, but Weill's piece doesn't require that kind of approach because of its waltz, fox trot and barbershop styles. Singers who have performed it include Martha Wainwright, Patti LuPone and Marianne Faithfull.

Since I had a child out of wedlock he thought I would be a bad example. I felt a knot twist in my stomach. If he were a Christian, wouldn’t he be understanding and happy that I had my son? Who was he to judge me?

It gets better. You’ve never met Muncher Bernie Wagenblast (don’t you just love the name?), but you have heard his voice if you have taken a ride on the AirTrain at Newark Liberty International Airport. He’s the Voice of the AirTrain, telling you what airlines are in which terminals. Bernie seems to know every long-gone, torn-down building or landmark within 20 miles of the airport. He is always pointing out vacant lots or new buildings where such-and-such once stood.

Here Mary shifts to the tragic toll gun violence takes, and doesn't return to the issue of the president - you can't fit everything into a column - and where the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance quality of newspapering comes into play. She wasn't tossing the ball to me, but I'm going to grab it anyway, and move it down the field, to mix my sport metaphors, since, as the election looms ever closer, a lot of groups are going to be asking that question. Hispanics will wonder: What has he done for us? His promises about immigration came to nothing. African Americans will marvel: Is this the guy who we were dancing in the streets for, three years ago last November?

This is a remarkable film with a strong performance in the title role. Ms. Sigman, whose beauty would shine in any contest, is only a couple of years older than the character she plays, and her professional experience is limited; she came to acting by way of modeling. Still, she energizes every scene she's in, i.e. every scene in the movie, which never for a moment loses track of her, or fails to show the action from Laura's point of view.

In 2003, the Justice Department investigated MTC's operation of the Santa Fe County Jail in New Mexico and found a shortage of staffing, including too few and undertrained medical staff. Investigators said that over several months, MTC tripled the inmate population to 580 without hiring additional guards or supervisors. A doctor visited every six weeks; the facility's one nurse was ordered not to spend more than five minutes with any patient. Officers, paid $8.50 an hour with no benefits, frequently quit to work for the state prison nearby. The report led the U.S. Marshals Service to remove the more than 100 inmates it had at the jail.

But Democrats and independent voters who were initially relieved by his apparent disinterest in conservative social issues such as same-sex marriage and political gamesmanship like reapportionment learned the hard way last year that Snyder's refusal to commit on such matters doesn't mean he won't sign retrograde or rabidly partisan legislation when it does land on his desk. (See last year's ban on health care coverage for same-sex partners and the Republican-led restructuring of Oakland County government, both of which became law with Snyder's consent, if not his active support.)

The rest of the country wondered if anything more might be expected, if Los Angeles had anything to say other than its advertised dreams. Seen from New York's Museum of Modern Art, Los Angeles looked like a mess of its clichés: happy, sun-besotted, trivial and too immersed in spectacle to make serious contemporary art. In Los Angeles, no one seemed to care, even though the shallowness was at least partly true.
The Assembly passed legislation Thursday stemming from an investigation into Sacramento-area peace officers suspected of using their positions to buy weapons not available to the public, then selling them for profit.

The scientists say they think their attempt worked while others had not because they enriched the cells injected for rod precursor cells, and also because they transplanted so many: an average of 200,000 per eye. Therapy of this type might ultimately be used to treat people with retinal degenerative diseases, but “many additional steps are required before these findings can be translated to the clinic,” the authors write.

The goal of the Democrats at this moment in history is to gain unquestioned control of the legislative process. In the Senate, that means establishing a 60-vote, filibuster-proof supermajority. The generic nature of their efforts in support of Merkley suggest they are more interested in getting their 60 votes than they are in the welfare of the citizens of Oregon. Merkley's own campaign has focused on his party's views of national and international issues and, where Oregonians come into the picture, they are often illustrations of those broader topics.

The breakthrough could also pave the way for Iran to convert its nuclear facilities into a Jolly Rancher theme park and for its secretive president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to join the international community, and perhaps the euro zone. "If we can get Kim Jong Eun to the negotiating table and the insider traders to cut it out, I don't see the mullahs being a big problem," the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a joint statement on gilded parchment.

But skip Valparaíso and you miss Chile's most memorable city. Perched perpendicular to the Pacific, the city's cerros, or hills, are connected by mazes of litter-strewn stairwells, paths and funiculars, essentially hillside cable cars. With any luck, you'll get lost. Like Bellavista, Valparaíso is covered with murals. Other buildings are painted shades of red, yellow, green and violet turning rows of homes into brightly painted, if peeling, rainbows. The only major attraction we visited during our three days was Neruda's famous four-story home, La Sebastiana, and frankly, we went as much for the walk as for the artifacts.
Arizona's new law is subject to potential abuse, Holder told a news conference. The law � which takes effect this summer � allows police to question anyone about their immigration status if they have reason to suspect they are in the country illegally, and makes it a state crime if they are.

Howard Troxler: So far Meek has been overshadowed by the Crist-Rubio drama but he seems to be running a reasonably competent campaign, which does not bode well for Crist as an independent. Crist is, after all, still a Republican, and for Democrats to flock to him en masse they have to be convinced that (1) Meek is a lost cause and (2) anybody is better than Rubio. A credible Meek campaign gives Democrats a reason to stay in the fold.

It's easy to see why the companies get blamed. The "Big Five" oil companies -- ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP -- reported a combined first quarter profit of $62.7 billion. Since 2000, their combined profits approach $1 trillion.
Gourmet, revered by many culinary aficionados, was launched in 1941 by Earle R. MacAusland as "the magazine of good living." It was known for more than just recipes: It dived into extended discourse about travel, wine and food, such as the 2004 piece in which David Foster Wallace argued against the practice of boiling lobsters to death.
Unlike Thomas Jefferson, who penned the Declaration of Independence, and other founders, who drew on very specific ideas about what constitutes tyranny and justifies revolution, you seem to believe that tyranny is simply laws and policies you don't like or didn't vote for  a complicated tax code, airport screenings, auto emission regulations, the like.

But look at the three biggest tax expenditures last year. First comes the tax-free treatment of health insurance premiums paid by employers; in 2008, Republican candidate John McCain proposed abolishing it as a sensible economic move, and Obama denounced that as a heartless attack on health care. Second, the mortgage interest deduction, which the real estate industry promotes as help for first-time home buyers even though it also subsidizes million-dollar vacation homes. Third: tax deductible contributions to 401(k) retirement plans. No politician is eager to wade into the buzz saw of protests that would greet a proposal to abolish any of those.

Foote learned a great deal from working with actors of this caliber, and he gave much to them in return. Not surprising for a writer so faithful to a traditional well-rounded sense of character, Foote came to playwriting via acting. After studying at the Pasadena Playhouse theater school in the '30s, he moved to New York, where he became a founding member of the American Actors Company. It was there that the dancer and choreographer Agnes de Mille, who had been doing improvisational exercises with him, encouraged him to pursue writing. Quickly, Foote's ability as a dramatist overshadowed his ability as a performer, but he never forgot that the heart of the theatrical experience is the flesh-and-blood actor willing to expose all for our collective enlightenment.

Boylan had perhaps the biggest score of the game, driving past Davis for a four-point lead as the clock slipped under six minutes.

But while we have achieved hard-earned milestones in Iraq, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated. After escaping across the border into Pakistan in 2001 and 2002, al Qaeda's leadership established a safe-haven there. Although a legitimate government was elected by the Afghan people, it has been hampered by corruption, the drug trade, an under-developed economy, and insufficient Security Forces. Over the last several years, the Taliban has maintained common cause with al Qaeda, as they both seek an overthrow of the Afghan government. Gradually, the Taliban has begun to take control over swaths of Afghanistan, while engaging in increasingly brazen and devastating acts of terrorism against the Pakistani people.

Certainly, the Hebrew word barah, usually translated created, could be used as a synonym for those other words. But barah is understood to mean creation out of nothing. Do you understand that God created the world out of nothing? Or was the world prepared, formed (out of something) and fashioned? To me, that's not exactly the same thing. Does this translation clarify or confuse the meaning?

I am deeply saddened to hear about the death of my colleague Congressman Donald Payne. The residents of the 10th Congressional District have lost a great leader and the Payne family has lost a beloved patriarch. My sympathies go out to his son Councilman Donald Payne Jr, his daughters Nicole and Wanda and his grandchildren. Human rights, health-care and education were among his top priorities. His leadership efforts in these areas will succeed him for many years to come. He was a champion for all people and believed that everyone should have the chance to realize their potential to the fullest. The Congressman's fight against discrimination and consideration for the underrepresented will never be forgotten. As a member of the US House Foreign Affairs committee I was honored to work with Congressman Payne on the forefront of efforts to restore democracy and human rights in nations throughout the globe.

Last week's arrival of the rocking "American Idiot" was a reminder that modern Broadway musicals are wanting to get edgier and more relevant to attract younger audiences. You know, the kind who wouldn't be caught dead in any theater not screening "21 Jump Street."

With Arizona's unemployment rate expected to remain above 9 percent through 2011, "good jobs" - paying a living wage, with some health-insurance benefits and maybe a 401(k) retirement plan - seem tantalizingly out of reach for many who used to enjoy takeout dinners and other little luxuries as a way of life.

To do this, you should level the soil in the area to be solarized and remove any obvious weeds, other plants, debris, rocks and soil clods. Wet the soil without saturating it to better conduct the heat. Spread clear plastic over the soil surface and bury the edges or weigh them down with something heavy to prevent the plastic from blowing away. The recommendations I have seen indicate that the plastic should be from 1 to 4 millimeters thick. In our Arizona summers, I would recommend 3 to 6 mm. Leave the plastic in place for at least eight weeks. You might also try to find sources for greenhouse plastics, which will be UV-treated and will last more than one or two seasons.
A: Well, there are obvious relationships when you stand on the street and look around. The Ponti used glass tiles. This building is titanium. But they are very coordinated. There's a play and a reflectivity and light conversation. Even with the geometry with Michael Graves, when you see the triangles and all the different edges, you suddenly begin to see that there is a three-dimensional space here. It's not just about pictures. And that's part of the interaction. This building will make the other buildings appear also fantastic, and that's what architecture should do. It should not just be about itself as a stand-alone phenomenon, but how does it contribute to the whole neighborhood?

The stadium bill could require two rounds of votes. If passed by the House, the Senate would act next - but the Senate's stadium bill is slightly different that the House's version. So if the different bills pass, a conference committee would draft a compromise that would require second House and Senate votes to get to Dayton's desk.
But the city's streets over the past year have filled with homeless people who are allowed to sleep on public rights of way.

Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on “Greensleeves” fittingly gave Phelps the spotlight once again. The concert concluded with selections from “Carmen”: first an assured, playful “Seguidilla” and then the ubiquitous “Habanera,” which Blythe made her own.

I've been testing the Player 3.6 for the past few days and comparing it with the latest iPod Touch. The Samsung has some advantages, such as a camera that takes better still pictures, an FM radio and expandable memory. But overall, it feels like a cruder device than the Touch. Its much lower screen resolution made text, video and images look grainy compared with those on the Touch, and its bulkier plastic case felt flimsy compared with the glass and stainless-steel case on the Touch, which uses Apple's latest OS.

Give Alfredson credit. His patience in telling the story is remarkable, given the non-stop action that passes for a spy movie today. Smiley is asked to sort through a large amount of information, to work at it till he gets it right. Alfredson asks the same of the audience, but the payoff is worth the effort.

Then a cloud slipped in front of the sun. A fast-moving shadow passed overhead. Except it wasn't a cloud. It was a condor! Circling and gliding, it swooped just yards from the trail, its massive wings (which can span up to 12 feet) dropping like a charcoal curtain in front of us. I stood there, so stunned and speechless that it did not occur to me to lift the camera around my neck. But luckily, I would get another chance — because for the next half-hour, we walked and watched as the magnificent birds looped and climbed, riding updrafts above our heads and along the steep canyon walls.
Her Otis students urged her to use Twitter. "My students said right away that I need to do social media," Lacy said.

Aristolochia littoralis has perhaps the showiest flowers in the genus. They feature 3- to 4-inch-wide flat faces, patterned almost psychedelically with maroon and yellow spots. The pattern is meant to look like rotting flesh to attract pollinators, though fortunately for us plant geeks, without the unpleasant odor. Behind these faces are curving, tubular white sections so that when viewed from the side, the flowers bear resemblance to Sherlock's pipe. Flowering begins in late spring and continues well into the summer. Once established and in full bloom, these plants offer a spectacular, unique show.

Kevin Pelton, Basketball Prospectus: Over the last two months of the season, I think Jonny Flynn showed enough to stick in the league, but not enough to earn himself a shot at a regular role. For the first time in his career, Flynn got regular minutes playing a pick-and-roll style that fits his skills. He responded by handing out assists at a strong rate with the Blazers, but he still struggled to finish in the paint, meaning he wasn't a particularly efficient scorer. And Flynn is too small to be much of an issue for opponents at the defensive end. Right now, I think he's suited for a spot as a change-of-pace third point guard with the chance to eventually refine his game and take over a backup job, not unlike another undersized lottery pick who disappointed early in his career and is familiar to Portland fans -- Sebastian Telfair.

Most of the people calling Trayvon a thug have never been around a real, bona fide thug (who can be any color by the way). But please, tell us, what is a thug? Again, you clearly don't know because thugs, by a "thug standard" aren't A/B students, they don't live in affluent neighborhoods like Miami Gardens, they usually don't have lofty dreams of becoming a pilot. Those are the things that describe Trayvon.

Get a grip and try something new to harp on, like the fact that a child is dead.
