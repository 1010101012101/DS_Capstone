Now 3 years old, Spella was a pioneer of Portland's new high-craft curbside scene, and it's still unlike any place in the country. His pursuit of excellence runs through everything -- the hand-shaken iced coffee, the elegantly spare, barely sweet mochas. For his amazing affogato ($3.50), Spella pours a double shot over the best gelato around; they're super-creamy, small-batch artisan flavors made in Eugene. The results are like a new coffee ice cream that's off the atomic chart. Pink Martini's Thomas Lauderdale orders it for breakfast. Who could argue with him?

Ann Romney has been called her husband's secret weapon, one with the power to warm her husband's chilly persona and attract female voters who have so far kept their distance.

In the past, Emmich has always hewed closed to the archetypal three-minute pop song model. “I’ve always loved pop songs, my favorite band is still the Beatles,” he said. But the songs on “Aide Memoire” stretch out leisurely over six, seven, sometimes eight minutes. “It was a less rational process than what I’m used to,” Emmich said. “It opened up a side that I think had been beaten out of me over the course of doing four albums within the normal confines of the music industry.

Also, it was very inspiring knowing that there was an audience at home that was waiting for this record. We promised it to them and I didn’t want to disappoint them.”

Almost as enervating is "social jet lag," which arises from variations in sleep length between workdays and weekends. This imbalance is felt most keenly by night owls, forced like "morning larks" to awaken at a fixed time during the workweek. On weekends, the sleep of late chronotypes extends longer, throwing their biological clocks out of sync. To judge from clinical tests, night owls effectively "appear to fly west across several time zones every weekend, returning east every Monday." Owls suffer anxiety and chronic sleep deprivation—in contrast to air travelers, who only experience the transitory effects of genuine jet lag.

Claiborne is such a gifted athlete with uncommon body control that he runs with his man fluidly up and down the field and still be able to break off at any time and get involved in plays coming across him. As a zone defender, he is simply an explosive athlete with length and can keep plays in front of him and react quick enough to meet the man at the ball. He is physical in run support and will have no problem coming up to tackle from the edge.

The Wednesday auction also contained five other works -- all oil paintings -- by Munch. Shaw confirmed that the two European collections supplying these works for sale agreed to do so only after learning that "The Scream" would be part of the auction. “For some people, the chance of selling alongside one of the great masterpieces in art history is pretty compelling,” Shaw said.

Hertz argues that if Avis were to buy Dollar Thrifty, it would control more than half the value market, which could cause antitrust regulators to question such a deal. To avoid any regulatory hurdles for its own deal, Hertz is conducting a sale of its Advantage value brand. Advantage is far smaller than Budget, Dollar and Thrifty.
"We’re in for a long haul here," the governor said. "If this storm hits the way it is (expected), people are going to lose power and they’re going to be out of power for quite some time. … This is not just a possibility — this is an overwhelming probability that this is going to happen, especially given all the rain that we’ve had over the course of the last 10 days. That’s going to make it easier for trees to blow over, take down lines."

No less obvious are the obligatory pop-culture references, which border on the cheeseball. A misty-eyed scene about the gang’s love for “Tootsie” leads to the song “Then Comes You,” which recreates the Lite FM sound of that movie’s theme, “It Might Be You.”

1 – Washington’s seed; Oregon State is seeded ninth.
Before the start of the 2011 season, Giants quarterbacks coach Mike Sullivan's departure after the campaign wouldn't have come as much of a surprise. In Sullivan's first season as quarterbacks coach in 2010, Eli Manning threw a league-worst 25 interceptions, regressing after a few years' worth of improvement. Some of the blame was targeted at Sullivan, who had been the Giants wide receivers coach the previous six seasons.

However, folks who are adventurous, open-minded, flexible and adjust well to change will find that working abroad is an enriching experience. International job seekers should realize, though, that they're not alone in their desire and determination to bid farewell to the U.S. and seek their fortunes overseas. Unfortunately, their eagerness makes them vulnerable to scam operations that promise overseas job placement but fail to follow through. These fraudulent offers are advertised in newspapers and magazines and on the Internet. Signs that might indicate a scam include asking for money up front, charging fees for providing job leads, using a post office box instead of a street address, declining to draw up a written contract and not producing references on request.

And through it all, there was that smile, and a, "Hey, buddy!" Junior always had time for me, always seemed to have time for everybody. Like Tony Gwynn with the Padres, he was accessible. He never tried to hide his failings on the field, and there were some because of the way he played football -- often recklessly, but with the overwhelming athletic ability to compensate for his mistakes.

I felt safe again. I knew my steps and performed. In fact, I stomped it out. I even added a little hop or two in there. I was just starting to feel confident again when the chorus came back up. Ah, that darn sashay crap! The two older ladies didn't even try this time - they just grabbed each others hands and swung around with each other like they had their own dance. I craved being a part of their party but couldn't move. I wiggled my butt a little more, to attempt to blend in with all the movement around me while inside I prayed the song to finish. I prayed that I would be transported to a place where I could just sway again.

The starstruck staff felt jittery. In previous Turkey Training Camps the kitchen was chaos, and our amateur chefs were cut throat.

Umenyiora, who didn’t sell his New Jersey home as he had considered over the spring and summer, said he remains motivated to play football for a few reasons: his 4-year-old son won’t watch a game if he’s not playing and his teammates “protected” him during the few days of practice he had in August before undergoing surgery.

The decision upholds the freedom of religious organizations to both define who constitutes a "minister" or leader within their community, and upon what grounds such "ministers" may be hired or fired. I place the word "minister" in quotes, because the term itself had become a point of contention, both for the Supreme Court and for the courts of public opinion surrounding the case. The Court's decision affirms that only religious organizations themselves can fully articulate who counts as a "minister" in their midst.
The William Secord Gallery in Manhattan is the only gallery in the nation dedicated exclusively to dog art. "We have had an increase in visitors over past years, but also a substantial increase in sales compared to this time last year," said Secord, widely considered the world's foremost authority on 19th century dog paintings. Through March 24, the gallery is exhibiting and selling 150 dog pieces that Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge bequeathed to St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center in Madison, N.J.

Perhaps because of the Saturday early warning to readers who might be offended by the subject matter, the decision to publish the series resulted in far less outcry than editors anticipated. All together, the editors involved and I got only a few dozen comments about it -- and many of those were before the strips even ran. At least half were from readers who supported running them.
In recent years, many drug companies have struggled to develop new blockbuster drugs, despite multibillion-dollar research budgets and more partnerships with scientists at universities and biotech companies. The dearth of successes, partly because the "easy" treatments have already been found, has turned the short-term prognosis for "big pharma" anemic.

Jason Lucarelli: Lucarelli runs 1-888-Ohio Comp, a workers' compensation management company. Kelley and another trial witness, Joe Gallucci, said they met with Lucarelli and his father, Sam, to discuss having the company pay Gallucci. Gallucci, who ran a sham campaign against Frank Russo, said he got five $2,000 checks from 1-888-Ohio Comp though he did no work for the company. Attorney Albert Giulani has repeatedly said the Lucarellis have done nothing wrong. He could not be reached Friday.

Hearts of romaine ($14) is DePersio's version of the classic Caesar salad; here it's updated with aged prosciutto -- what a great idea -- and grated ricotta salata. Fall harvest soup ($14) is mushroom-based, but this is not a heavy, earthy soup. This boasts at least a dozen fresh vegetables in a light broth; swimming atop are three pieces of crostini smothered in homemade pesto. DePersio will tell you his vegetables are fresh, but the beans and peas in this soup are so alive with flavor you wonder if there isn't a garden in the kitchen itself. (Proving his love of vegetables, DePersio offers a vegetarian tasting menu.)

Prawn coconut masala ($15) tastes almost like a Thai dish, mildly flavored with coconut, ginger, chiles, intensely reduced red onions, cashew paste and a spice blend with citric overtones that leads to a clean, refreshing finish. At first it seems almost too sweet, but the flavors have a cooling effect when eaten with the spicier dishes.

Many suspect that the Japanese monetary authorities, grappling with anemic growth levels, will intervene directly in the markets again to push down their currency’s exchange rate by selling yen for dollars, should the dollar drop below 80 yen for the first time since 1995.

“Everything kept getting better as rehearsals went along because we were open to new ideas, and it was a true collaboration,” Saint says. “Even our poster slogan — ‘the all-talking, all-singing, no-dancing musical comedy’— is a send-up of the advertising used by screen musicals of the '30s.”

The views emanating from the Grand Old Party these days are pretty much devoid of middle-ground opinions and certainly of liberal sentiments.

Today, 20 years after the violence of 1992, Los Angeles is not cocky. It is chastened and uncertain.Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center is gone, although its rebirth is promised. Developers, lenders and insurers turn up their collective noses at huge vacant lots on commercial avenues. The prisons are full, the state is broke, and South L.A. is now being called upon to reabsorb the thousands of men who were sent away by the tough-on-crime, cheap-on-aid policies of the 1980s and 1990s.
In the letter withdrawing the plan, Lucas said he no longer believed he could maintain a constructive relationship with the neighbors and castigated Marin for being "a bedroom community" that is better suited for subdivisions instead of business.

Acito's new play, a touching comedy about, among other things, gay penguins in a New York zoo, is called "Birds of a Feather." Rosenstock's play spins a multilayered tale about desire and love out of the Greek myth of the Spartan queen Leda being seduced by Zeus in the form of a swan, and to keep our "family newspaper" credentials, let's paraphrase its title as "99 Ways to Romance a Swan."

Sunday afternoon at Arco Arena  um, Power Balance Pavilion  was eerily reminiscent of the days when the Kings were good and the Maloofs were flush.

Following the scandal that erupted immediately after Adams took office, involving repeated lies about his personal life, Portlanders never knew when they could believe their mayor.

Nettheim is weaker on suspense. The mystery goes slack as the film trudges on. Martin rents space in a rural home for his base camp, and his involvement with the owner (Frances O'Connor) and her inquisitive kids (Morgana Davies and Finn Woodlock) begins to take precedence over his quest.

Here’s the final reminder: The pass rush is the key to everything — it is the pass defense on this team.

Rachel Robinson started the foundation within a year of her husband's death to ensure that "his legacy be continued through a proactive, important progression of our people," Baeza said.

Brookings found good access in the city of St. Louis and the inner parts of St. Louis, Madison and St. Clair counties.

In America, any successful attack—no matter how small—is likely to lead to a series of public recriminations and witch hunts. But security is a series of trade-offs. We've made it through the 10 years after 9/11 without another attack, something that was not a given. But no security system can be maintained over the long term without public support and cooperation. If Americans are ready to embrace risk, it is time to strike a new balance.

There are economists who insist that companies must focus only on the cold, hard bottom line—and that capitalism itself depends in part on this unwavering focus. Back in 1970, Milton Friedman wrote a legendary essay for the "New York Times Magazine" titled "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits." Friedman pooh-poohed companies' charitable efforts, arguing that it's the sole duty of a business executive to maximize profits for shareholders. If executives wish to do good, they are free to plow their salaries into charitable works. The company itself has no special competence in good-deed doing and should stay well clear of the game.

Heather knew that Evens Paul would be frightened. He calls her "Mama," and she couldn't get to him. The Gorackes' other sons - Brayden, 8, and J.T., 4 - worried for their brother Evens Paul, whose photo is all over the Goracke home.

The U.S. was about a minute shy of the victory it needed to advance to the tournament semifinals as the winner of its group when Alas charged up the center of the American defense and uncorked a blast from 25 yards out that bounced once before eluding backup U.S. keeper Sean Johnson, who got a hand on the shot but couldn't stop it. That not only knocked the U.S. out of the tournament, but also it changed El Salvador's fortunes, with the Central Americans leaping from elimination to the top of the Group A standings ahead of Canada, which tied Cuba, 1-1, in Monday's first game and advances as the group runner-up.

In the meantime, some worry that Judge Mackey's warning telegraphs an invitation to criminals looking for easy prey. But Charles Riley, a Munroe Township trustee in the county, is all over that one.

This example of the malignant malice of some liberals against the president who became 20th-century liberalism's most consequential adherent is described in Robert Caro's “The Passage of Power,” the fourth and, he insists, penultimate volume in his “The Years of Lyndon Johnson,” which when completed will rank as America's most ambitiously conceived, assiduously researched and compulsively readable political biography. The new volume arrives 30 years after the first, and its timing is serendipitous: Are you seeking an antidote to current lamentations about the decline of political civility? Immerse yourself in Caro's cringe-inducing catalog of humiliations, gross and petty, inflicted on Johnson by many New Frontiersmen, and with obsessive hatred by Robert Kennedy.

Part of the reason for the mistrust of the federal government's ability to manage comprehensive reform is that the nature of immigration across the southern border has changed. In years past, groups of illegal aliens crossing the border tied to human smuggling or drug cartels were the exception to the rule. Today, such ties are the rule. The vast majority of illegal border crossers now have paid to be smuggled across, and an increasing number of these crossers are carrying drugs to subsidize the cost of their passage.

Before you get the impression that I'm some Homer Simpsonesque tub of doughnut-worthy lard, let me add that I've moved on from my pastry fixation. After crossing a middle age threshold of sedentariness, I realized that the doughnuts and Danishes were starting to claim squatters' rights - they would enter my body and decide to take up permanent residence there. Fortunately though, I have all these wonderful pastry memories to cherish, and I can still drive past a doughnut shop slowly and take several deep breaths.

Here's what else I found. If Moyer makes the Rockies -- and right now, early in camp, it looks like he just might -- he'll become only the second non-knuckleball pitcher in history to throw a pitch at age 49 or older. The other was the legendary Satchel Paige, who came out of retirement to pitch one game for the 1965 Kansas City A's. He was 59, but that was a kind of novelty act.

Mr. Cameron is in the midst of his most difficult stretch since taking office in 2010. The U.K. has slipped back into recession, pressuring his government's attempts to tame a big deficit with tough austerity measures. The government's recent budget was widely criticized for pandering to the rich.

"Kolohe" in Hawaiian means a mischievous prankster. But the younger Andino, 17, has a reputation as a nice kid who has been schooled by his dad not only on what to do right, but how wrong it can all go if you make bad personal choices. He's nicknamed "Brother" by Dino, now 43, for Kohole's place in the family. But everybody uses the nickname -- from friends to the surf media to the contest announcers. Part of it is people trip over saying his real name, but it also fits – at 17, he's like the kid brother everybody wishes they had.
