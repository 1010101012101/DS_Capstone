It would be an understatement to say Reid's never been particularly popular here. I mean, the team brought back a coach a couple of weeks ago who never won a playoff game and won only one division title and he got a standing ovation from the fans at the Linc. Reid will never get that here, not even if he won a Super Bowl. If he won, they'd just say, "It's about damn time. He should've won two or three by now."
"It was for our benefit to keep the Coliseum running and operating for the benefit of all the people who would come to events," Huntsman said.
Does that mean the deli might get bigger?
For reasons I couldn’t begin to explain, her father the king (Ciarán Hinds) has promised her hand in marriage to the villainous Sab Than (Dominic West) of the Zodangans.
Bellous states, "it is hard to understand how the egregious and criminal acts of the banking industry, insurance giants, mortgage sector and Wall Street corporate gamblers have been quietly swept under the rug while principalities of greed spotlight public employees and their middle-class wages as bankrupting the country." According to Gov. John Kasich and other Senate Republicans, Ohio's greediest are police officers, firefighters and teachers. However, I haven't met a person in these career fields who told me he or she works each day solely because he or she enjoys raking in large salaries courtesy of taxpayers. More specifically, I haven't talked to many public educators who tell me they do their job each day because it allows them to take "working beach vacations," hold "meetings" (on the golf course) and entertain clients at professional sporting events -- all as write-offs because that is all part of the job. Certainly, these highlighted private-sector perks aren't superficially paid for by taxpayers, but in the end they are because eventually these expenses get passed on to all of us by way of goods and services.
Soon-to-be House Speaker John Boehner announced today that he'll host a summit meeting in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday with the nation's newly elected Republican governors, including Ohio's John Kasich.
Supreme Court justices, like anyone else, sometimes change their minds.
"We got all these cases of bananas from Zupan's that had mistakenly been put in the refrigerator," says Urban Gleaners founder Tracy Oseran. "If you put bananas in the refrigerator they turn black. But they were perfectly fine. There are those kinds of things over and over again."

This isn't to say, Mr. Gates got it right and Mr. Jobs got it wrong. Their successes and failures are well-known. Mr. Jobs's products are elegant, Mr. Gates's are nerdy. Mr. Jobs was uncharitable. Mr. Gates has spent his fortune on charity. Mr. Jobs drove hard bargains and used monopoly power to shut out collaborators. Mr. Gates sometimes did the same, but his product philosophy was more about sharing and openness.
"It was alright," he said. "We were fine in the first and as the game went on we kind of dipped a little bit. It happens and we'll be better as the series goes on."
Eventually, relief will come, from a cold snap that kills buds or when blossoms turn to fruit.
“I’d rather have a pep rally a week from (today) back at MetLife Stadium,” he replied.
It seems the residents in Isleworth felt a similar disconnect with Tiger, especially when they compare him to Bubba. Even though Bubba has been renting in Isleworth for only a couple of months, he's made friends, greeted neighbors and become a willing part of the neighborhood.

Shakopee-based fashion designer Christopher Straub and Ronnie Cooper shared a semi-sweet moment as 250 guests mingled at a private party celebrating the opening of "Happy Chic" NYC designer Jonathan Adler's new store in Uptown. Among the items for sale at Adler's first Minnesota store is the book written by his husband, Simon Doonan. Doonan wrote "Gay Men Don't Get Fat," a witty paean to gay wisdom probably inspired by Miereille Guiliano's 2004 "French Women Don't Get Fat."
It wasn't long ago that the unemployment rate was closer to 10 percent and stagnant, making it easier for them to claim nothing was getting better under Obama. Now they have to calibrate.
pushed school shootings to the front of media headlines and many parents’ concerns, the trends seem to be improving in terms of student-initiated shootings. One possible reason: heightened awareness of the problem on the part of parents, teachers, and fellow students, who may be more willing to act on early warning signs.

Among all of the big decisions on state policy and spending were a few less serious provisions. Microbrew drinkers may be disappointed to learn state lawmakers will not be allowing beers with alcohol content up to 18 percent to be sold in Ohio. The current alcoholic content allowed in Ohio is 12 percent for beers, and Senate lawmakers had wanted to bump it up.
"The only way you can really be an artist is - you have to have a screw fall out of your brain," he says, half joking.
Penn & Teller’s successes are many. They’re responsible for the Showtime network’s longest-running series, “Penn & Teller: BS!,” sold-out Broadway runs, Emmy-winning TV specials and three New York Times bestsellers, and they have been named “Las Vegas Magicians of the Year” five times. Yet their creative process remains pure.

The officer took him to Rite Aid where the employees confirmed he was the man.
Two new attractions will make their debut Thursday at Tokyo DisneySea: the "Fantasmic" nighttime spectacular and the Mickey and Friends' Greeting Trails character meet-and-greet area. The park has postponed plans to celebrate its 10th anniversary in September, out of consideration for victims of the disaster.
Chesapeake spokesman Ryan Dean said the company has begun to hire and train locally for roughneck jobs that start at $60,000. But it flies in specialists to design, build and run the derricks, which resemble outdoor manufacturing plants, span five acres and cost $8 million apiece.
Under questioning by County Executive Steve Ehlmann, Grellner acknowledged that local-level prescription requirements don't keep meth makers from moving to other locales. Such ordinances are in effect now in 33 cities and counties, including Wildwood and Eureka.

After a first period in which Washington blocked nine shots, the Capitals got in front of eight more in the second and allowed only nine to get through to Holtby. The Rangers, who trail only Washington in blocked shots in these playoffs, had six through two periods and yielded 10 on goal.
But even as costs rise, the district expects to have $13 million less to spend, she said. The primary decreases will be due to a $5 million drop in state funding as federal stimulus funds run out, $6 million less in reserves at the start of the year and $4 million less in one-time funds, primarily $3.8 million that the district withdrew from its insurance reserves to balance this year's budget.
I can't imagine why any man who watched Augusta chairman Billy Payne stonewall and obfuscate Wednesday on the issue of female membership would want his wife, daughter, sister, mother, friend, mare, doe, filly or Girl Friday within 100 club lengths of joining this place.
District estimates indicate close to $576,000 could be saved by closing Mt. Pleasant, with the majority of the costs coming from personnel costs on the central level, such as administrators and classified staff. Those numbers would rise to $601,000 the next year.
“Bank of America ATMs are not located in every neighborhood, particularly the areas where our membership serves the ‘unbanked’ and the ‘underbanked,’Ÿ” said McClain, referring people who don’t have accounts with commercial banks or credit unions, or who use them in conjunction with check-cashing services, rent-to-own businesses, payday loans and pawn shops.

The formation of the new CHSAA Archdiocesan league makes this more than just a friendly crossover like years past. The Bears and Pilots are expected to be two of the division’s top clubs and this early season contest could go a long way toward playoff seeding.
In 1958, Meier coauthored a paper that introduced the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The method, according to the University of Chicago, "incorporates data from patients (in clinical trials) who have been followed until death, as well as others who survived."
And the marketing of excess food helps drive the obesity epidemic. The increase in waste parallels a 26 percent increase in food available to each American between 1974 and 2003, the years of the study. That translates to 800 extra calories of food available per person per day, even as our population has grown.
"There's nothing quite like the face-to-face meeting," said Ohio Hotel and Lodging Association executive Director Matt MacLaren. "Businesses looking to be healthy or grow have started to do more meetings."

As a recent, six-month relocatee to San Francisco, I have to comment about sidewalk etiquette here: There is none. Walking on busy sidewalks like Union or Fillmore streets resembles a scrum. People, it's OK to move a few millimeters to let someone pass. Try to think "rules of the road" as far as what side of the sidewalk to be on. Recently on Union Street, a Lululemon-clad missile crashed into my wife - of course, she was on our right, mowing people down. Sweetheart, if you're reading this: The 49ers are looking for an offensive tackle.
Roshon Fegan had a hard time with the sensuality required for his rumba. When partner Chelsie Hightower asked him what sensual means, he said, "Huggy." The two tried to be sexy as Smokey Robinson sang Cruisin' and the crowd seemed to like it, even though he looked silly as he exaggerated the aggressive moves. Len said the movement was "clipped and jerky." Bruno said his steps were more suited to hip-hop. Scores: 7, 8, 8 = 23 + 5 = 28

Facebook members in the United States and the United Kingdom can now publicly share whether they are registered organ donors, an initiative that donor advocates say could be crucial in raising awareness of people in need of life-saving transplants.
For example, in the aftermath of last night’s defeat, Girardi was asked about the slow starts of players like losing pitcher Freddy Garcia (6.97 ERA in two starts), second baseman Robinson Cano (one RBI) and catcher Russell Martin (.160), and all he did was say it was early in the season and he expected they’d all get things turned around.
It's time for the city council to end this foolishness and forge a new deal. The hearing by the council's Community Development Subcommittee is on the fourth floor of City Hall, 100 N. Holliday St.
Every time I'm cruising the aisles at the craft store, I can't help but stop and admire all the tiny scrapbook charms. Recently, I bought a handful - not for my scrapbooks, but for a Scrapbook Charm Necklace.

Tebbutt, who transferred from Horizon Christian to Oak Hill Academy (Va.) during the summer, had widespread interest before his senior season. In Tebbutt's case, he felt going to Oak Hill would open more doors and options in the eastern United States, so he chose to wait until April. In fact, Tebbutt doesn't plan to make any of his five official college visits until March.

On Sept. 13, U.S. District Judge William D. Stiehl accepted McAfee's guilty plea to 16 counts of making false statements, 15 of mail fraud, three each of wire fraud and falsifying records and one count of lying to FBI agents investigating a possible civil rights violation.
The vigor of Mason's monitoring for corruption surely will be an issue if he seeks re-election in two years, even without specific allegations that he ignored evidence. For it is impossible not to think that a laissez-faire attitude from the county's legal watchdog might make it easier for shoddy practices to flourish -- as one example, on the county boards of revision. Cuyahoga County taxpayers may be out millions from mistakes and improper shortcuts in how the county handled property-tax appeals, Mason's personal residence included.
While regulators opted for a narrow set of standards to define the "qualified" mortgage, they allowed greater flexibility for sponsors of securitizations to decide how to retain risk. Critics have said the risk-retention rules could fail to ensure better underwriting or have more serious, unintended consequences for housing markets by raising costs for even qualified borrowers.
Specific coverage: Make a list of what each policy covers and the amount of benefit it offers for each item. Create your own comparison list, including: Preventive screening, daily benefit for hospital or intensive care, drug and medical benefits in-hospital, chemo or radiation benefits per treatment, surgery benefit, anesthetic, hospice care, transportation to out-of-state treatment, blood and plasma benefit per occurrence, ambulance service, post - surgical physician benefit, X-ray and lab benefits, bone marrow transplant, prosthetic devices - and even coverage for experimental treatments.

On his new live album, "Songbook," rocker Chris Cornell recasts tunes from throughout his career, in "unplugged" mode. The former Soundgarden and Audioslave singer headlines a sold-out concert at 8 p.m. Saturday at Lakewood Civic Auditorium, 14100 Franklin Blvd. Craig Wedren opens.
Meanwhile, Atlanta’s proposed response to this national trend — the July 31 T-SPLOST — remains stuck in the past. While the tax would fund initial segments of some popular transit projects like the Beltline, every new track-mile of light rail built would be matched by 16 lane-miles of road expansion — enough asphalt to cover Turner Field more than 200 times. Despite talk of the tax “transforming” metro Atlanta, in reality this plan is largely a business-as-usual approach.
At the end: The shortcomings I've pointed out here are mostly nitpicks. Sienna continues to be a contender.
(Slim doesn't think much of women poker players: 'Women are made to be loved and petted, not to gamble with.' Several years ago, when Riviera Richmond, a hard-bitten matron from Beverly Hills, was leading the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, Slim pointed to her large pile of chips and muttered, 'That money has no home. If she wins this tournament I'll slit my throat. I'd rather see an early frost on my peach trees than have to look at her.')
Children in all three groups reduced their body mass index and waist circumference after two years. However, at that two-year point the diet program and the combination program had better results than the activity program.

Stoudemire didn't change his answer. But hey, you can't blame the Suns. At the very least, they've decided they're going to do what they can to avoid a Stoudemire-induced storm.
"Wednesday was our focus meet of the week, and we had great weather, so we wanted to take advantage of it," James said. "This is still great competition, and we had a chance to shuffle kids around a little bit. It's all part of our process to prepare for the rest of the season."
Of the 30 players the Browns are permitted to bring in for visits, 24 have been identified, and they've conducted private workouts with a few others. They've also sneaked a few players into town without their names leaking out, and they'll draft some players who weren't on the list. Last year, for instance, they kept Pittsburgh's Jabaal Sheard under wraps until draft day.

"As long as they were trucking it in, we were fine," she said.
"For the last four years, I've had to fill out a lineup card and Chapman just rolled off the tip of the pen," Hill said. "Another game, another start for Chapman in center. He's been in center field for virtually all four years. It's a special feeling knowing how solid he is in the outfield and what kind of player he could turn into."
Lincoln was the best-selling U.S. luxury brand as recently as 1999. Now it is eighth, with a stodgy reputation defined more by the bulky Town Car airport limousine than anything hip. Ford is looking to change that.

"The results that we see could be impacted," Adams said. "That is a real fear of a superintendent who has walked the grounds every single day for the last 39 months. It's a delicate balance."
There's something un-American about the government rescuing private companies that made bad bets in a competitive marketplace. It runs counter to the mythos of this land of opportunity, where the freedom to fail goes hand in hand with the freedom to succeed. It also violates our sense of fairness: Why should the reckless get help when the prudent do not?
It's less than a week until the NFL draft begins and perhaps St. Louis' biggest ''draftnik,'' Howard Balzer, is out of a broadcasting job. But that doesn't mean he won't be covering the draft on the air, something he has been doing since 1979 - when he was working at The Sporting News and Bud Brewer at KSD (now KTRS) 550 AM, asked him to help with the coverage.
"People have been afraid to go there," he said, but it's a small market with limited options for renters, and its fortunes will turn around quickly if the economy continues to improve.

"Building on home retention and payment assistance programs already in place, we are meeting our obligation to deliver this additional relief to our customers following the completion of the recent global mortgage settlement," Ron Sturzenegger, legacy asset servicing executive, said in a statement. "To the extent principal reduction and other modification tools help us turn mortgages headed for possible foreclosure into long-term performing loans, it will be positive for homeowners, mortgage investors and communities."
"I strongly believe that Arizona will ultimately prevail in all of these legal challenges," she said. "My defense of the rule of law will continue." In addition to Tucson's claim, five additional lawsuits challenging SB 1070 remain in play.

The key is how to distribute those revenues. Gov.Martin O'Malleyand the state legislature should consider altering the split of casino revenues (currently, 33 percent for the casino owners and 67 percent for the state of which almost 50 percent goes for education). Certainly, there should be some way to take perhaps 5 percent or more of Maryland's 67 percent and put that in an account that would be drawn from once a year to help balance the budget.

It's hard to believe that only four years ago, Kim was being heralded as a rising star. He won Quail Hollow by five shots for his first PGA Tour win, then won the AT&T National two months later to become the first American under 25 since Tiger Woods to win at least twice in one season. At the Ryder Cup that year, he was catalyst in a rare American victory.

Local 54 has repeatedly clashed with Revel over tax subsidies that the $2.4 billion casino has received, as well as four or five-year term limits it has imposed on many customer service jobs.
Romney, mired for months in a contentious primary, has not yet devoted substantial resources to a national field program.

GM's numbers don't provide a lot of evidence that such a shift took place. While the Cruze did significantly better than its predecessor the Cobalt did a year ago, sales of GM's trucks grew as well. Also, the Chevy Aveo subcompact posted a sales decline in March. GM plans to replace the Aveo with a new Michigan-built Sonic late this year.

If he isn't okay with this, or starts acting weird, you can always back out.

A: People are correct that most beer is not meant to be aged, if you assume most beer is like light American lager. That style is meant to be enjoyed fresh, ideally on draft, and served very cold. However, many beer styles are bigger ales (8 percent alcohol by volume). These often benefit from age, where the flavors can marry and continue to develop. Barleywines, wheat wines, old ales, imperial IPA's, reds, stouts, porters . . . I could go on and on and often do! These beers are gems to be purchased two bottles at a time. This gives you a chance to taste one right away and then again in the future to tangibly note how it changes, often improving and developing. Bottle-conditioned beers (yeast still present and active) are beers to look for and cellar at cooler temperatures, too.

A: Actually, my respiration has been fine throughout this process. The difference was there was a five-game losing streak last season, a response, and then restored confidence. But now, this malaise, especially on the road, has been ongoing for a month. That's a pretty long period of mediocrity in a relatively short season. Now if the Heat were looking at homecourt in each round of the playoffs, it would be another story.

David Kinch of Manresa also credits family history for his menu's main course: a braised pork shoulder with cabbage, chestnuts and white beans. His Pennsylvania Dutch parents prepared roast pork with sauerkraut at holiday time, but after moving from Lancaster County, Pa., to New Orleans, embraced the custom of eating black-eyed peas at New Year's. Combining all these elements - pork, cabbage and beans - Kinch produced a lusty French-style garbure, a stewy soup, that reminds him of childhood holidays.

to know where your wine came from (without just reading it from the label, of course), an easy way to tell is how it is classified. The region it was made, such as Bordeaux, Rioja, or Chianti will classify a European wine. The type of grape that was used to create the drink will most often classify a non-European wine. Now you can go to the wine-night get-together and actually sound like you know what you're talking about… sort of.

Dwayne De Rosario's production. The scoring binge that resulted in the 2011 MLS MVP award is a thing of the distant past for the D.C.

Despite so many talented freshmen, the one who’s impact may be felt the biggest is Kentucky’s 6-11, 240-pound Turkish import, Enes Kanter. One problem: a Turkish team has claimed that they paid Kanter to play for them — a clear NCAA violation. Kentucky, meanwhile, is stuck waiting to hear from the NCAA on whether Kanter will be cleared to play. If he’s cleared, UK will be a force. If not, they’ll be alright, but likely not a title contender.

I have seen and heard repeated complaints by both politicians and religious leaders that freedom of religion is denied them when others of competing faiths demand the right to practice what they believe. I rejoice in a First Amendment that allows me to believe what my church teaches, behave according to my church's rules, and share my faith with others by means of example, information and gentle persuasion. I do not assume the right to demand that laws from the state impose the disciplines of my faith on others who don't share it.

HBO’s much-hyped swordsy fantasy epic Game of Thrones packed loads of stuff into its premiere episode Sunday: severed bodies, more sex. But it’s a matter of some debate whether strong female characters are part of the Game plan. There’s no doubt that among the seemingly infinite cast there are women — and memorable ones, at that. The question is whether they’re an endless parade of misery and victimhood or inspiring figures who triumph in a very masculinized fictional world where no one even thinks of giving the titular headwear to a chick.

A. Spring pruning of crape myrtles seems to be a free for all. Many like the natural crape myrtle tree or shrub look and others want them reigned in to a few trunks each year. Even after what some call 'crape murder' pruning techniques all crape myrtles appear to flower well, but those heavily pruned may not open their blossoms until later in the season. So, the pruning technique gets down to what shape crape myrtle you like. If you want the natural looking plant, removal of seeds pods and weak limbs may be all you need to do. Otherwise, they can be reshaped to whatever a gardener or maintenance company feels is best.

Near Ellis Park is a spot you can visit -- Constitution Hill, where South Africa's highest court meets in a chamber partly built from recycled prison bricks.
