This summer, that changed. The project's goal was to find failing paint, strip it and add outer layers that would last. In today's preservation world, that meant setting up scaffolding, performing forensic analysis and working up a structural study of sorts — in this case, the first ever done on the dome's whole surface.
"It's my job to be profitable at whatever level the market is at," Odell said in an interview in London. "We're taking out temporary workers and cutting hours, and we'll continue to do that.

"To think that there's a bureaucrat in the United States Army that would consider the use or abuse of First Amendment rights in determining who is going to perform at an Army base is an insult and defiles the sacrifices of those heroes who fought for the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights," Ted Nugent told the Associated Press.

At least he's better prepared after last year's ordeal. He bought a couple of extra sump pumps to keep his basement dry as the river edges to within 100 feet of the ranch-style house where he and his wife, Darcy, live.

From 2006 to 2009, the state could afford to shell out the $120 million in new school spending that was needed each year to phase in the plan by 2013. During those years, per-pupil spending rose by as much as 20 percent in some of the neediest school districts. At the same time, the hold-harmless districts benefited from the plan's extras, adding an average of $580 in new money per pupil under the plan, according to a legislative report.

"There are laws that prohibit the retail sale (of raw milk) because this is not a safe product," Hedberg said. "People think there is a controversy. There is no controversy. People routinely used to get sick from raw milk."
Director Martin keeps the tone aptly quiet and restrained. In line with this, we only see Thurkettle's interviewer from the back, his voice calm and polite yet inquisitive. The director, Jon Gaw and Brian Fichtner's set design features a ring-like schematic that informs the play's confessional dynamics. As he subtly repositions the women from their places on the circle, Martin's blocking reinforces DeMaio's words. David Chorley's often delicate sound design similarly underscores each woman's narrative.

I've given this some thought (hard for me), but allow me to tell you why. Strong safety is the one position Smith has failed to address since he allowed Rodney Harrison to skedaddle in 2003. He has solved half of his deep middle defense with the blossoming of free safety Eric Weddle into a first-team All-Pro. The strong part of it, no. Barron solves it. Period.

A sign in front of a nearby tank full piranha insists the fish are vegetarians, but no such spin is in evidence at another exhibit displaying a green anaconda. These snakes can grow to 25 feet and weigh as much as 400 pounds, and they often dine on capybaras - the world's largest rodents - that weigh 150 pounds or more. Visitors are encouraged to stick an arm into a device that is similar to a blood pressure cuff, to get a feel for death by anaconda.

Though rendered in myriad color schemes outdazzling its predecessor's brown-and-white, and though set in a wildly imagined future instead of a finely grained present, "Bodyworld" turns out to be another showcase for Shaw's emotional generosity.

Tolentino no longer works at the hospital. He said he resigned about four months ago when he said it did not take meaningful action against a pharmacologist who appeared to be intoxicated while providing patient care. Jim Blue, a spokesman for the VA's New England region, said the VA would thoroughly review the allegations. "But let's be clear: The employees (at Manchester) take the quality of mental health care they provide very seriously. When problems are identified they are promptly addressed," Blue said.
President Barack Obama has offered a raft of proposals aimed at fine-tuning the system and making repayments easier. Yet the predicament of debt-burdened former students has failed to generate much notice in the GOP presidential campaign.

A minor glitch in the Lake Erie Monsters' plan for Saturday's Patrick Bordeleau Bobblehead Night: Bordeleau is suspended for elbowing.

Much of what should be done is not new. Rather, it is a question of refining and adapting strategies, tactics, and methods that have already been developed and proven effective, then applying them more widely and intensively. The most non-traditional is perhaps to focus on root problems. These include developing the will and capacity to conserve and management natural resources. We should help people, from high-level decision makers to those who live close to nature and depend on it to exercise enlightened self interest. This is about awareness-raising and motivation — "hearts and minds" as the phrase goes. The traditional conservation approach of studying, monitoring and documenting the trends and decline of wildlife and habitats is insufficient. We have to work in teams to solve problems, not just document them and bring the bad news to the public. Sure, it's important to know what's going on and to bring this information to the world, but without action that deals with the immediate needs and underlying causality, it is merely hand-wringing and is really quite depressing. In most places we know enough to act, but the comfort zone of many conservationists is more studies and analysis. Science is important and the basis of our professional knowledge. Also important is our ability to work with people —I would say the most important. Getting the balance right between studying and acting is way off kilter, in my opinion. It's relatively easy to monitor what's going on and very difficult to do something effective and long-lasting about it. That's a key point we need to get right.

It foreshadowed a propensity to take other people's concepts, improve on them and spin them into wildly successful products.

This is tragic. A recent tasting of top producers of the Grand Crus of Clos Vougeot and Echézeaux reminded me of the elegance, depth, power and greatness of pure, unblended Burgundian Pinot Noir.

Cheese. "If it's runny and gooey, we won't let it in," says Janice Mosher, manager of the customer service center for the CBP.

The raw-milk cheese regulations are the FDA's bailiwick but, at least for the time being, the FDA doesn't care what you bring in for yourself.

Details: Manna from heaven is the best way to describe this bread. It's spongy soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. You buy it frozen, but it thaws quickly and is great for French toast, stuffing, grilled cheese and deli sandwiches. (Pack slices still frozen in a lunchbox, and the bread will be perfect by lunchtime.) We find that shelf-stable GF breads tend to crumble when you take a bite, so the Udi's product is a vast improvement. Two slices have 180 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, no cholesterol and 1 gram of fiber. Udi's makes other frozen GF products, including sliced white bread, bagels and pizza crusts. We took the frozen bagel ($6 for a bag of four) and put it in a 350-degree oven for 3-5 minutes for a crispy-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside result. Very yummy.

Although offshore wind farms are relatively common in Europe, they have been slow to develop in the United States amid debate about their cost effectiveness and environmental benefits. They are certainly not the sole answer to Maryland's future power needs, but if the state has any hope of achieving its aggressive goals for renewable energy — and particularly if it hopes to do so in a way that benefits Maryland's economy — offshore wind needs to be part of the picture. Maryland is committed to getting 20 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, and that will almost certainly require harnessing the wind off the Atlantic Coast.
Based on two recent visits, this Whiskey Joe's is splitting the difference. Some 20-somethings, but the crowd spans a few decades beyond that. Some folks are business people bedded down in the nearby Rocky Point hotels, some are locals just out to enjoy the sunset and a little happy hour.

Independents will be Romney's biggest challenge this fall, if he wins the nomination. That's especially true if Democrats succeed in their bid to paint the Republican candidates as badly out of step on issues such as women's access to birth control.
In another classroom a social worker, a medical social work intern and a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) discussed how each found their career path and their specialty interest, their specific education requirements, continuing education requirements and how in each one of these jobs, you had to like people and you also had to work with people in a way that sometimes made you the "bad" guy in order to help the client help themselves. And students asked them tough questions. What is it like to tell people what they don't want to hear? How is the salary? How much paperwork? Given the economy has your case load increased?

Since your son hasn't made his final decision, I suggest that you, your wife and your son go visit a local recruiter. They're generally very open to including parents in the process. At the very least, this will show your son that you respect his decisions and that you're concerned that he make the best choices. If he hasn't already seen a recruiter, this meeting will give all of you a chance to find out what positions (called MOS -- military occupation specialty) your son is qualified for. Not everyone has to be a grunt (an infantryman). Speaking with a recruiter can also help your son clarify his goals and give you some insight into what's driving his desires.

Bret McKenzie is the music supervisor and primary songwriter for "The Muppets," and his biggest competition for award consideration may just be himself. He has at least three compositions from the film being touted by those who track such things: gleeful production number "Life's a Happy Song," disco anthem "Me Party" and existential '80s-ish power ballad "Man or Muppet." Sporting a comfy-looking green hoodie and unruly hair and beard — exacerbated by early-morning dad duties — the affable "Flight of the Conchords" musical comic discussed marrying his adult and meta sensibility with the Muppets via video chat from his home in New Zealand.

Her relationship with another girl, who thinks Laure is actually Mikael, complicates things. Discovery of the truth may be inevitable, but will Laure/Mikael find acceptance from her friends?

But he was absolutely right. It's talent. Either you got it or you ain't. Give someone else the premise of "Blazing Saddles" and you'd probably get only the vulgarity. Only the farting scene. Give it to me and my cohorts and the engine is the prejudice against the black sheriff that drives the movie. So you've got to know how to do it.
The average age of autism diagnosis is between 41/2 and 61/2 years. SARRC researchers said that in many cases that means a child is 41/2 to 61/2 years behind in development when compared with typically developing children. SARRC is trying to diagnose the disorder in children as early as possible.

"I thought: I'm going to watch this team and see what happens."
We had a wonderful and very dedicated clientele who I will always remember and thank for all the years they made it possible to open the doors every day, many of whom became good and lasting friends.

These are important issues, properly addressed by the bishops. However, at a time of economic crisis and growing anti-government ideology embodied by the tea party, Catholic bishops would do well to once again offer a compelling moral response to radical individualism and unbridled capitalism.

In 2004, Cardinal created Municipal Sewer Services, which took over a bankrupt company's multimillion-dollar city contracts for inspecting sewers.

"To have four schools within eight miles of each other and force half the town to go to schools performing not as well because of what side of the street they live on, it's unfair," said Adam Finkel, one of the parents who raised an alarm about the issue.

In many other ways the two men might as well be clones. Obama and Brown both gave the impression they were not your ordinary political animals. Indeed, both seemed likeable and friendly, but not in the sleazy way that most politicos ingratiate themselves with the masses. These guys appeared to be genuinely, dare we say, charming.

Do not put extra material in the bottom, such as gravel or some other such material, to aid drainage. It doesn't work. Good drainage is dependent on the potting material used and the drain holes in the container. The gnats need a moist environment for feeding and continued breeding. Avoid over-watering. Let the soil surface dry out as much as you can between waterings. Make sure there is no standing water in drain trays. Keep dead plant material and debris cleaned up. I have heard that �1/2-inch slices of raw potatoes on the soil surface will attract the larvae. Adults are supposedly attracted to red cooking wine or fruit juice. Good luck!

You'll fare better upstairs. No need to spring for reserved seats, which will set you back a few bucks more. Standing in the balcony gives you a nice view of the stage, plus an infinitely better aural experience. -- John Soeder, Plain Dealer Pop Music Critic

Westbrook said he spent the offseason "debating" whether to go back to his comfort zone and lift his hands above his head as he went into his windup. Eventually, he settled on a compromise. His hands would start at chest level - and the consistency has followed. Westbrook improved to 2-0 with seven sturdy innings Sunday in the Cardinals' 10-3 victory against the Chicago Cubs. It's his first 2-0 start to a season since 2006.

The Saints, the No. 1 seed in their district, will need players who can attack. The district they're in is one of the best, if not the best, in the state. Host Westminster, 17-5 and the No. 2 seed, could potentially eliminate Villa again. No. 3 seed MICDS (19-9) and No. 4 seed Visitation (13-10-2) are dangerous, too.
If an applicant has issues such as gaps, is desperate for work, or feels his or her qualifications lack, the best approach is to form a plan – maybe even seek a career professional's help – not to fake information.

"Why anyone is committing fraud is they're missing something on their résumé. And the way to neutralize that is strategically, not fraudulently. It's not a lack of resources, it's a lack of resourcefulness," says Block.

Just days after 9/11, Congress authorized the use of force against al Qaeda and those who harbored them - an authorization that continues to this day. The vote in the Senate was 98 to 0. The vote in the House was 420 to 1. For the first time in its history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization invoked Article 5 - the commitment that says an attack on one member nation is an attack on all. And the United Nations Security Council endorsed the use of all necessary steps to respond to the 9/11 attacks. America, our allies and the world were acting as one to destroy al Qaeda's terrorist network, and to protect our common security.

But Manele Bay I could get used to. It's snuggled against Hulopoe Beach, which has made many U.S. "best beach" lists over the years.

The explanation of all this was not so much in local pride as in the habits and character of the champion, which make it possible to accord such recognition to a winning pugilist. Kilbane, modest and without pose, is hailed as one pugilist whose way of living has been clean, and who has remained unidentified with saloon and poolroom crowds. His domestic ways, his affectionate pride in his wife and baby, his loyalty to his blind father, make him perhaps the first champion fighter who may be compared to Jack London's idealistic heroes of the ring.

In short, you would disable every religious community from considering the scriptural and doctrinal implications of a candidate while they still have time to do something about it. That is one reason that a pastor's "individual" right to speak is not enough. Christian pastors have long felt the obligation to inform their congregations on engaging the broader culture. Pastors have praised and panned American military leaders, celebrities, business moguls and even sitting politicians, often to good effect. But when it comes to the congregation's obligation to vote, vote wisely and vote morally, only one class of Americans gets a free pass from the pulpit's moral scrutiny: candidates.

But before we get too smug, we should recognize that our legal tradition has roots that are not all that different from those we condemn, and you don't have to look too far back in history for outrageous examples. For example, it was only in 1980 that the California Legislature made it illegal for a husband to rape his wife. As late as the 1950s, the right of a husband to take his wife by force was enshrined in the laws of every state. As legal authority Rollin Perkins put it in 1957: "A man does not commit rape by having sexual intercourse with his lawful wife, even if he does so by force and against her will."

Elise Testone -- "I Want It All" was a perfect song for her. Great performance. She milked it for what it was worth. She seemed pretty relaxed and flowed with the song. But, yikes, she struck a bad note with her bluesy take on the Hendrix song.

In 1998, Fisher, then 23, a model and aspiring actress, was enjoying a sunny summer day at the Shore with friends. Perched on her friend's shoulders, she dived into wave after wave until he told her he was ready to head back. She wanted one more ride. He dove, and she felt like she hit a brick wall. He found her lying facedown in the surf, conscious and holding her breath. She knew instantly her neck was broken.

"What we can't do is refight the battles of the past two years that distract us from the hard work of moving our economy forward. What we can't do is engage in the kinds of symbolic battles that so often consume Washington while the rest of America waits for us to solve problems," the president said. "The tax cuts and other progress we made in December were a much-needed departure from that pattern. Let's build on that admirable example."
All of this makes Aksoy cringe. He said that nationalism is the wrong word for defining his movie. "It's patriotism and all our nation is patriotic," he said. "The Turkish nation has always complained that we have a glorious and rich history, but we haven't shared it with the new generation here and the rest of the world."
-- Cisco Systems received two shareholder proposals at its annual meeting in November. One sought to tie options vesting to performance goals, while the other asked the company to examine -- and consider limiting -- the pay gap between its highest and lowest-paid employees.

Here are highlights from coverage around the nation:
His movement without the puck is also something that ensures Briere will get open for chance after chance. In fact, minutes before Briere potted the game- winner against the Devils on Sunday, he was able to put the puck in the net from the left side of the crease, setting off a premature overtime celebration. Briere clearly kicked that one in and the goal was correctly reversed.
Until recently, it was also a largely unnoticed one.
More of Rush Limbaugh's advertisers say they are dropping his program after the conservative talk show host's derogatory comments about a Georgetown law student.
A spokeswoman at the Corps office in Memphis, which covers the Mississippi below its confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, Ill., said this afternoon, "They haven't made a decision. They are positioning people and moving up barges in case, but they will not do anything today."
It's a dilemma a number of other Portland-area bars and restaurants say they've encountered with the deal site, which allows diners to buy "gift certificates" from a regular lineup of establishments. Unlike daily deal sites such as Groupon or Living Social -- which run deals for limited periods of time and collect money they share with participating businesses -- Restaurant.com sells coupons and keeps all the revenues. The benefit to participating eateries, Restaurant.com contends, is a steady flow of new customers who must spend a minimum amount at the restaurants to redeem their coupon.
"Business dress today is confusing," Nix-Rice acknowledged. "On one hand, you don't want to look like the dork who didn't get the business casual memo. But on the other hand, you don't want to be the slob who doesn't tuck in his polo shirt."
The Stanley Cup itself also spent time in Hollywood in recent weeks during its usual globetrotting tour, making visits to the sets of "Glee" and "Bones" for photos with hockey-loving actors Cory Monteith and David Boreanaz, among others.

With that four-cup requirement, the increasing selection of dry, better-quality kosher wines is a blessing to those of us who cringe at the thought of having to down super-sweet kosher Concord grape wine. Although Concord grape wines are traditionally used during seders and other Jewish rituals held in this country, there is no dietary law that says kosher wines have to be sweet. In fact, they are made like other wines, although the grapes and wine must be handled only by observant Jews during the fermentation process. When there is a possibility that a non-Jew might be pouring the wine after fermentation, some observant Jews require that their wines also be flash-pasteurized, a step called mevushal.

Most of the cash that fuels school bond campaigns in California is tinged with self-interest. Under state law, school districts can't use their own funds for campaigns. That leaves other interested parties - underwriters, builders and organized labor.
To impress the adults in your traveling party, book a room at the renewed Pavilion Hotel, right on bayfront Crescent Avenue. Formerly known the Pavilion Lodge, the place was redone and reopened in 2010 with lush landscaping in its courtyard, an inviting fire ring and hints of mid-century modernism here and there. (And go in spring or fall, preferably on a weekday, when you can often get in for less than $180 nightly. On summer weekends the same room can cost more than twice that.) For dinner, head to the sleek dining room of the Avalon Grille, which opened in 2010 a few doors away at 423 Crescent Ave. (Both of these places are run by the Santa Catalina Island Company, as are many other island businesses.) The next morning, browse or snack in tile-fronted CC Gallagher (523 Crescent Ave.; 310-510-1278) which sells sandwiches, coffee, landscape paintings, wine and sushi. That's right: CC sells sushi down by the seashore.

Passion is never a problem for Ohio's most conservative crew. On Nov. 10, Wachtmann and a few other House conservatives walked off a chartered bus taking lawmakers a few blocks from the Statehouse to a special joint legislative session event honoring Ohio veterans. The reason: the bus driver was a union man.
Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Stanley Hazen, whose research last year uncovered a link between heart disease and an individual's intestinal flora -- the bacteria that aid in digestion of food -- has entered into a licensing agreement with a diagnostic company to develop the test.

Jerry Zillner of Detroit didn't know he was mentally ill until after he started serving a 13- to 50-year sentence for second-degree murder, a crime he committed in early 1986, when he was 19, after a neighborhood man assaulted his mother and sister on Detroit's east side. He was diagnosed in prison with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Zillner, 44, was paroled on April 5, after serving more than 26 years in prison.

Then there are the improvements statistics don’t convey as he has evolved into a legitimate linebacker instead of a defensive end playing out of position: his ability to drop back in coverage against dangerous tight ends and the aptitude to plug holes against the run.
“For every .25 the county increases its tipping fees, the city rate goes up .4 per quarter,” Fischer said. “So that .16, plus the built in .32 contract increase accounts for the .48.”

But here's the problem: When police in most suburban communities in America get a 9-1-1 call regarding a suspicious male with a gun, they respond with all due urgency. They determine the threat level before they relax their guard and re-holster their guns. That's appropriate.
Prosecutors say they've nailed a band of identity thieves that ran a stunningly simple scheme to defraud businesses, banks and government agencies of more than a million dollars.
The council approved the new Transportation System Plan by a 3-1 vote, with Mayor Craig Dirksen absent. Councilor Marland Henderson cast the lone vote against the plan, saying he didn't feel the timing was right to change it.
Q.: First, let me say how much I enjoy reading your stuff. Extremely informative. I am very high on Matt Carpenter and think he could be better in the long run than either Freese of Cox. What is your evaluation of him and what will happen over the winter at 3rd base? Carpenter is close to ready yet is blocked by Freese. And Cox has to be ready for AAA. Does not someone have to exit here?
With just eight seniors on its roster, it's conceivable that the Bombers will be right back in the thick of things next year.
“For example, a house we did ... all of the windows are alarmed independently, not in a series, so if you open one window, you’ll know which window is open. The system will literally tell you the front right bay window is open,” he said, adding that such a system can be useful for landlords.

Asked about Reed's comments Friday, Wood repeated his position. "I would expect the mayor of Atlanta to be biased in favor of his city," Wood said. "I believe it’s not a regional project. It’s to move people in Atlanta and around Atlanta, and Atlanta’s not the entire region." He was not swayed by the argument that Roswell residents could work at the new jobs created by the Beltline.

The Blazers plucked McMillan, affectionately called "Mr. Sonic," away from the then-Seattle Supersonics before the 2005-06 season hoping that his no-nonsense approach and Old School reputation would be the perfect antidote for a struggling franchise trying to move on from the Jail Blazers era.
A: Yes, that change was made before Turiaf was sidelined, with Bosh and Haslem likely the opening power rotation in the playoffs. In fact, I would not be surprised to see Joel Anthony ahead of Turiaf in the postseason rotation, with Turiaf possibly to turn into this year's Erick Dampier when it comes to the playoffs. Haslem's shooting Wednesday was a step forward. Now he has to get his rebounding to come around to the level it was when he was playing as a reserve.
The comic takes the moment when the Kurgan's essence was transferred to MacLeod, and uses it as a device for the Kurgan to tell his story. It is the first time the barbaric Kurgan's origin has been told in any medium.

Maybe that was a tipoff, too.
1 Spend carefully. Whether it is the miles per gallon of the car we drive or attention to medication costs, careful spending brings good results. Without even considering taxes, every $100 a month not spent eliminates the need for $30,000 of retirement assets, which is more than 40 percent of all workers have in savings.
That means we can't contribute to political campaigns or hold fundraisers. We can't sign ballot initiatives but we can vote, a private action.

Here's an idea taken from soccer: Let the teams play one extra inning to get it done the usual way, then resort to a home run hitting contest between the two clubs. The very best hitters of one team against the best of the other with 50 pitches given each. Then you simply count the number of home runs and the team with the most, wins. If no home runs are hit, a tie is declared.
"Stuff like that is a little bit weird," Riley said. "It's kind of a new world were in, that way."
The vigil inside the former church is closed to the public, but over the years, a crowd has gathered outside the gates to watch. After the "Poe Toaster" failed to show in 2010, last year's vigil attracted impersonators, including a man who arrived in a limo and a few women.

Fire victims could now file notices of claim — the first step to filing a lawsuit — with the state for their losses.
