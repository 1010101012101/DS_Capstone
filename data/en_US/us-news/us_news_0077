The study involved 22 men with prostate cancer. All of them were scheduled to have their prostates removed, and some of them took metformin for about seven weeks beforehand. After the prostates were excised, researchers from Toronto compared them and found that tumors grew more slowly in men who took the diabetes drug than in men who didn’t.

Greece's embattled prime minister faces a crucial vote of confidence in parliament later Tuesday. If the vote fails, it would throw into doubt whether Greece will implement new austerity measures required for the next $17 billion in aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.

Jackson's plan would possibly expand the school year or school day, set up a merit pay system for teachers, base layoffs on teacher performance and make getting rid of poor teachers easier. Seniority would no longer be the sole determining factor in layoffs, and continuing contracts would end for new teachers and be limited for teachers already in the system.
This story of a team is mostly about Rush, a high school hoops star who was cut from her team and who, in coaching the Macs, settled scores with the coach who didn't value her talents.

Cyclists on this route will definitely want to be fortified as they approach Bixby Bridge, the marathon's halfway point, and Hurricane Point, a mile south of the landmark structure. Completed in 1932, the span made from a single concrete arch stands more than 260 feet high and extends more than 700 feet across the canyon and Bixby Creek; for marathoners heading north, the bridge is a reward for the grueling two-mile climb up and rapid mile-long descent down the point. For those of us not in a rush, both the bridge and the summit of Hurricane Point, which offers sweeping prospects on non-foggy days, make obvious photo ops.
That's just one example from a long list of improvements and renovations that cinema savior Meyer and his sidekick Paul have made since resurrecting the Richmond District theater four years ago.
"Firefighters get orders to risk their lives in buildings that are on fire," Szabo said. "When they get clear orders, they follow them.

Together, Colin and Isabella have taken what was always a rugged and beautiful valley and breathed new life into it. "It was quite derelict—the whole valley was really shot to pieces and it had an element of decay about it," says Colin. One of the basic problems was that it was overrun with sheep, which had "bonsai'ed" the property's ancient wild birches. Colin relocated the tenant farmer and his sheep to another part of the estate. Within 15 years, upward of half a million birch trees have replanted on their own. "It feels brighter now," Colin says. "The valley just has more sparkle in it." Now, flocks of blackface swales graze in the fields in an organized fashion and in the winter are taken down to the sea for lambing.

"Farther Away" offers a series of takes on the actual life, as filtered through Franzen's abiding obsessions: literature, birding and (yes) himself. I'm tempted to add Wallace to that list, since the book, or part of it anyway, exists in both his real and metaphorical shadow; among his most widely read essays is an earlier Kenyon commencement address. But if, at times, Franzen himself seems to want to frame the collection as his side of an ongoing discussion with his dead friend about art and life and the necessity of engagement - "I understood," he writes at one point, "the difference between his unmanageable misery and my manageable discontents to be that I could escape myself in the joy of birds and he could not" - that is, ultimately, too reductive a lens.
Some Portland teachers, by earning pay for extra hours and extra duties, come away with far more than the $72,000 listed as the top of the district's teacher pay scale.

That could mean gambling on more costly projects. The water authority recently decided to spend about $400,000 analyzing a concept that was last assessed a decade ago: delivering water from Imperial irrigators to San Vicente Reservoir near Lakeside.

A. I wrote this memoir for my father. When he died in 1988, there was a big funeral. I was 24 and very arrogant. I was supposed to deliver a speech. I was better educated than he was. My father wanted to teach me the traditional ways to do things and I wanted to find new ways. I thought I was better than him. At the funeral, I just went up and bowed to the mourners. I didn’t say a word. As I approached middle age, I started to understand my father. I owed my father a eulogy. I wrote the book in an attempt to re-evaluate my father’s life and my family.

How might you know that Canadian folk-rocker Roxanne Potvin used to be a blues singer? Perhaps you can tell by how well she’s able to make effective, compelling music from the most rudimentary materials. Many of the songs on “Play” are little more than a simple, repetitive melody sung in Potvin’s modest voice, some sandpaper guitar and a straightforward drumbeat. The French-language “Dis-Moi Que Tu M’Aimes” is little more than a shout, a swirling Farfisa riff and a few well-timed halts by the rhythm section; somehow, it’s irresistible. “Pretty Girls” repeats its title over and over like a drawled mantra — it’s more hypnotic Velvet Underground than modern pop. “Let Me Go” is little more than a blurt, but it’s certainly an arresting one. Potvin keeps things punchy by getting in and out of her songs quickly — several tracks on “Play” barely break the two-minute mark. It’s all such fun that by the time she drops her languid cover of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” on you at the conclusion of the album, you’ll barely mind. Fans of Liz Phair’s early insouciance and Lucinda Williams’ occasional whimsy should search this out.

PASADENA, Calif. - James Van Der Beek is tossing away his image.
It seems to always be identified as "common sense" to pass a law when it affects someone else.

Valverde is another story. Left-handed hitters are hitting .435 against him and slugging .870. You can dismiss that as a slow start. I wont.

A: It will be more than two weeks without the three together, but health is paramount. You'd just hate for the Heat to struggle in a series early and say it's because there's a re-adjustment period. My take is a few of these off-day practices or shootarounds this week essentially will be playoff practices, with little concern, if any, given to game planning for the Celtics or Wizards.

What combination will she be wearing? Tonal shades, such as red with fluorescent pink. She probably will go for a dress because there's less legwork in putting it all together, Brooks says.

John Wayne Airport confirmed the tests last week to my colleague Jeff Overley. It was the first news of the new service.

I was having one of those debates recently about Nicklas Lidstrom. We all agree that Lidstrom is one of the greatest players of his generation and perhaps the best overall NHL defenseman since Bobby Orr. But we also know that he plays hockey, which is not necessarily the most popular sport in America. And hes a quiet, soft-spoken guy who is often overshadowed by teammates (Steve Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov etc.) and other players (Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin etc.). My father lives in northern California and is a huge sports fan. But hes not a hockey fan. I asked him one day if he knew who Lidstrom was and he said no. I was thoroughly disappointed.

Rather, they wanted the new government to rely on the law director.
On one occasion we enjoyed a tender pot roast ($18) with three hunks of meat sitting on about a pint of mashed potatoes, green beans and baby carrots, all smothered in gravy; it was an all American classic done well - yet on another visit, the braised pork cheeks ($15) needed stronger oversight in the kitchen. The meat was tough and the bacon-fried rice with peas and potatoes had the texture of mushy couscous. Still, for $15 it was a good deal, and with a little more care it could have been exceptional.
The activist group Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders has targeted all six New England states for passage of a gay marriage law by 2012.

There's another thing that I'd like to say, and that is it's very easy to focus on all the negative when you're living it all the time and you have to face what I have to face. I have a hard time even saying where I have got to go. Hard for me to say that I have to go to prison. And that's a hard word for me to say. And in the nighttime when I say my prayers, I kind of speak to God euphemistically about helping Patti and the kids through this, and then me through this next phase. But it is the reality as it is today. And now we have to face it.

Whether Kim Jong Un eventually can chart a new course for North Korea to pull it out of the shadows of his father's paranoia remains to be seen. The scariest outcome would be another destabilizing power struggle. But the saddest fate of all for North Korea would be if this succession yields no change at all for a nation that pours resources into the military and weapons programs while most citizens live in appalling deprivation. That would be a tragedy of the first order, for those who live in and near this feudal police state, and for the world.

It's unusual for crossovers to even offer manual transmissions, as the base Outlander Sport and Tucson do. Both models feel more economy car than sporty. In the Outlander, I found shifting to be relatively effortless, if a bit boring. Unlike the CVT I tested last year, though, I could control the acceleration smoothly. An example of man being mightier than machine, I guess.
The bailouts already adopted by President Bush and Congress were bad ideas, and they have not helped the economy. McCain's mortgage bailout is a bad idea, and it will not help the economy. And the mortgage foreclosure freeze proposed by Barack Obama is a bad idea that will not help the economy (actually, it's a terrible idea because it undermines the rule of law and is akin to the banana-republic policies that have turned nations such as Argentina and Zimbabwe into basket cases).

Following the big ol' tearjerker was Brielle Von Hugel, who sang "Someone Like You" by — you guessed it — Adele. I can't blame Brielle though, as the huge popstar seems to be within in her wheelhouse. The judges disagreed, criticizing it, saying it was pitchy and that she was in trouble in the competition. She should have known she was dead right there.
"It makes it challenging when you're flipping people over," coach Steve Spagnuolo said. "When Jacob got hurt, it really switched three spots, which is what you have to do sometimes. We moved Harvey Dahl back down there to guard, and he hadn't got a lot of reps there, but he's played it, so he knows it. You have to make some adjustments, yeah."
For many reasons, the Heat are going to be intensely motivated to prove people wrong. James said he's keeping score of all his detractors. Wade is a monster when playing with a chip on his shoulder, as he did during the 2008 Olympics, when he regained his own elite status. Pound for pound, this Heat team is better than the '96 Bulls, and will play a softer schedule (19 sets of back-to-back games, compared to 23 for Kerr's Bulls).

"Someone's got to step up," coach Jim Tressel said Tuesday. "I mean, who cares how difficult it is? ... We've got to have someone ready. What's why you get to practice Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and have walk-throughs on Friday. If you want anyone to care that you've had three guys in your secondary hurt, you're coaching the wrong sport at the wrong school because we've got to be ready."
The hockey team, which long has been in a rebuilding mode, has been given a relative free ride in a lot of media circles in comparison with the nearly daily dissection of the Rams and Cardinals. This probably is due in large part to the Blues being viewed by many as more accessible and fan friendly than the other local teams and the NHL having a lower profile than the NFL and MLB.
But attorneys for DePascale and those identified as defendants insist the cases aren’t closely enough related to warrant consolidation and are asking Superior Court Judge Linda Feinberg to keep them separate.
Ever wonder why this address came to symbolize Tinseltown? Well, a brick structure at that corner, the Taft Building (1680 N. Vine St.), was where most of the studios and many agents had offices. This made it a busy spot for actors looking for work.

One out of two of us lives in a community where it is legal to fire a woman because she is a lesbian, or to refuse to rent a house to a man because he is gay. The Defense of Marriage Act denies married gay couples the economic benefits our government bestows on married straight couples. Women make 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, and only 18 Fortune 500 companies are run by women, a gap many experts attribute more to the lack of public support for mothers in the workforce than to gender discrimination in the boardroom.

In 1990 he had marketed the Can-Am Spec Racer, an affordable racing car for entry-level drivers.
This other chart-topper is, believe it or not, a better bet. Teen sensation Justin Bieber’s track list overlaps with Bublé’s (of course), and his versions of “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” and “The Christmas Song” aren’t sung with the same confidence or skill. But he enlists Mariah Carey herself to help out with “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” and makes room for an unlikely Busta Rhymes cameo on an uptempo, beat-driven version of “The Little Drummer Boy.” This “Drummer” is just as awkward as it sounds, but at least it’s different.
I've already lost my home to foreclosure. Can I get any help?
Monday night's Raw will be interesting to see how Lauriniatis handles the situation now that he's solely in charge of WWE. Hopefully the storyline continues with him punishing members of Team Long, while giving special treatment to the men who represented him in the match.
It’s just before 7 on a Thursday morning in April, and KU coach Charlie Weis is making a point. In a specific sense, the point is about celebrating. The Jayhawks are in the final minutes of an early-morning practice, and junior kicker Ron Doherty has just knocked a “game-winning” kick through the uprights. And in Weis’ mind, the team’s reaction was too tame.
"The pitch I hit, I think, was a rise ball that didn't rise," Miller said. "It was right in my zone, so I just took a swing at it."

According to test run by National Geographic, a pit bull had a bite force of 127 P.S.I., with 320 P.S.I. being the average for domestic dogs. The pit bull also had lower jaw strength than both a German Shepard and a Rottweiler. The myth of the pit bull's superior jaw strength is probably based more on their tenacity than their actual jaw strength.

While the Car Allowance Rebate System, CARS for short, officially ended Monday, most Northeast Ohio dealers gave up on it last week.

Cursed (new in 2011) - Even with triple the monsters of last year, there was nothing that could save this werewolf maze that amounted to little more than a long walk through a fog-filled tunnel of camouflage netting. Magic Mountain needs to retire rather than re-theme these ride queue mazes if the park hopes to improve the quality level of Fright Fest. (Tidal Wave queue)
There are clues as to what the governor will say.
"That was years ago," she said.
Although the federal judge who heard the lawsuit had ruled against protesters' claims that the troopers used an unconstitutional "gender-specific" search or excessive force, Defend Life members continue to insist that alleged sexist behavior at the police training academy contributed to aggressive and demeaning arrest tactics.
While we're at it, let's talk about six other ways to streamline government around here:
Alito says the reason that insured people absorb the costs of the uninsured is because the government has required hospitals to treat people who lack insurance, and instead of paying for it with a tax on everyone it has allowed the cost of uncompensated care to be shifted to those who buy health insurance.
Normally, the party's screening committee meets with the candidates and then makes a recommendation to the full county committee as to whom they believe should receive the organization line in the June primary.

No guides are needed for hiking and biking, and there are beautifully marked and maintained trails galore in the 1,200-acre state park and the 4,600-acre Botany Bay Plantation, a treasure trove of history that includes the remnants of two grand houses, Seabrook and Bleak Hall. Sketches of Bleak Hall at the Edisto Museum will take your breath away; now all that remains are several of its outbuildings, including a perfectly preserved ice house. This Greek Revival structure from the 1840s boasts interior walls constructed of tabby, a mixture of lime, sand, water and oyster shells. (Tabby was unknown outside the South of the 18th and 19th centuries, and historians still debate its origins.)
Mayor James W. Knowles III said that Ferguson residents had strongly indicated they wanted a community center. In 2005, a master park plan recommended closing the old community building at January-Wabash Park and razing it. The council adopted a resolution to replace it with a new community center.

One thing hasn’t much changed: Jerome Robbins’ choreography. It’s stunningly reproduced by Joey McKneely. The “Somewhere” ballet, in which the kids envision better lives for themselves, is most touching. Aravena leads the ladies in an exciting, skirt-swishing “America.” One song is called “Cool,” but it sizzles when led by Drew Foster’s Riff.

At a contentious meeting of GOP senators Wednesday, some expressed concern about Mr. Shelby's talks with Mr. Dodd. According to people familiar with the meeting, Arizona Sen.

Sizer, during Oregon Public Broadcasting's "Think Out Loud" radio broadcast Tuesday, was asked why police are shooting unarmed people, and whether police should be trained to wait until they see a glimmer of metal or a weapon. "If you wait for a gun to be presented, you can be shot before you're able to return fire," Sizer said. She said she knows some police may wait until a gun is seen. "I know many officers have that as part of their personal ethos, taking personal responsibility to put themselves at greater risk." As a matter of policy, though, Sizer added, "I'm not willing to go there."
