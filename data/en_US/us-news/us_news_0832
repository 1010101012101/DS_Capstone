In one misguided marketing attempt, Lionel introduced a special "train for girls" in 1957, with a pink locomotive and pastel-colored freight cars. No chartreuse caboose, though. The experiment was a horrible flop, but great news if you bought one of them and never used it: supposedly a mint-condition set is worth tens of thousands of dollars to collectors.

You can also be conservative with respect to a given institution while being un-conservative in every other respect. The most ardent Communists in the Chinese or Cuban politburos are often described as "conservatives." The same holds true for every left-wing institution in America: Someone has to be the "conservative" at PETA or Planned Parenthood -- i.e., the person who is risk-averse when it comes to scarce resources or the group's reputation.

of musical history. Why is that? When most people hear about St. Louis, they only hear about the Arch and the violence. Musically, St. Louis is right up there with Mississippi, New Orleans and Memphis. But because it didn't have a title, like Mississippi's Delta blues or New Orleans' jazz, or Memphis, which had so many big stars come out of it; because it was so versatile, it kind of got swept under the rug as far as history is concerned.

And now Sue Digre, who after over 10 years still does not understand how a city council meeting works, tried to appoint Leo Leon last week. She had to be told this was not allowed. And isn't it telling that she tried to appoint Leon? Another anti-business, pro-tax, no-development, environmental radical card-carrying member of the Sierra Club. In fact, the Sierra Club (who wants to close the golf course) recommended Leon for the job. Some say "Well ,Leo was the next runner up in the last election." What? He lost by a landslide in an election almost two years ago. Do we appoint McCain if Obama resigns? Ridiculous. We need this guy like we need more fog.

Campbell said he had been pleased with Seastrunk's progress in the last week, pointing out that "he got better in the last couple of days here at getting the ball up the field.

WR Victor Cruz. I don’t have a rooting interest. Seriously, I don’t. But when it comes to night games, we have to write as the game is going on and file by the final gun. So naturally, I had a running story about the Giants’ winning the NFC East that was about to go up in smoke because the Cowboys were making a run. So I said aloud, “Where’s Victor Cruz to save my running gamer?” There he was, down the field singled-up on CB Orlando Scandrick. That was an absolute prayer of a heave by QB Eli Manning and it’s at least the third deep jump ball Cruz has won this season. (Off the top of my head I’m recalling the one against Philly and the one against Seattle.) To be coming up with those plays at only 6 feet tall shows you what kind of athleticism he has. It’s the kind of athleticism that leads me to wonder once again, “How in the world did this guy go undrafted?!”

In a near-perfect ensemble like this one, it's hard to pick out particular singers for notice.

A. A player with four or more accrued seasons whose contract has expired. He is free to sign with any club, with no draft choice compensation owed to his old club, through July 22 (or the first scheduled day of the first NFL training camp, whichever is later). At that point, his negotiating rights revert exclusively to his old club if by June 1 the old club tendered the player a one-year contract for 110 percent of his prior year's salary. His old club then has until the Tuesday following the 10th week of the regular season (Nov. 13) to sign him. If he does not sign by that date, he must sit out the season. If no tender is offered by June 1, the player can be signed by any club at any time throughout the season.
"Postcards" is Edwin's second full-length feature and anything but a follow-up to his first, "Blind Pig Who Wants to Fly," which began garnering attention on the festival circuit in 2008. Where "Postcards" is almost a Zen meditation on the push and pull between safety and risk, "Blind Pig" was a sharp attack on racial attitudes and social politics in his homeland, ones that he knew too well. The film examines what it is like to be in the minority, ethnic Chinese, which Edwin is, in the mostly Muslim country. "I don't know whether we were more angry or sad, the feelings are complicated," he says, referring to his close circle of friends and creative collaborators.

This growing dependence on wealthy taxpayers is being driven by soaring salaries at the top of the income ladder and by the nation's progressive income taxes, which levy the highest rates on the highest taxable incomes. The top federal income-tax rate has fallen dramatically over the past century, from more than 90% during World War II to 35% today. But the top tax rate—which applies to joint filers reporting $379,000 in taxable income—is still twice as high as the rate for joint filers reporting income of $69,000 or less.

Last night, however, scrolling through the jubilant status updates on Facebook, watching the joyous crowds on television, I found myself feeling a bit queasy. We Christians follow a Savior who rejected the way of violence and instructed us to love our enemies. I lean toward pacifism but I don't know if my pacifism is deeply rooted enough to stay with me under any and all conditions. I understand those who feel that killing Bin Laden was a necessary step for the U.S. government to take. But even if this was necessary - and I'm stressing if - Christians, at least, should respond to the death of an enemy with some sobriety.

A Creole Bovary is this little novel of Miss Chopin's. Not that the heroine is a Creole exactly, or that Miss Chopin is a Flaubert--save the mark!--but the theme is similar to that which occupied Flaubert. There was, indeed, no need that a second Madame Bovary should be written, but an author's choice of themes is frequently as inexplicable as his choice of a wife. It is governed by some innate temperamental bias that cannot be diagrammed. This is particularly so in women who write, and I shall not attempt to say why Miss Chopin has devoted so exquisite and sensitive, well-governed a style to so trite and sordid a theme. She writes much better than it is ever given to most people to write, and hers is a genuinely literary style; of no great elegance or solidity; but light, flexible, subtle, and capable of producing telling effects directly and simply. The story she has to tell in the present instance is new neither in matter nor treatment. Edna Pontellier, a Kentucky girl, who, like Emma Bovarv, had been in love with innumerable dream heroes before she was out of short skirts, married Leonce Pontellier as a sort of reaction from a vague and visionary passion for a tragedian whose unresponsive picture she used to kiss. She acquired the habit of liking her husband in time, and even of liking her children. Though we are not justified in presuming that she ever threw articles from her dressing table at them, as the charming Emma had a winsome habit of doing. We are told that "she would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart; she would sometimes forget them." At a Creole watering place, which is admirably and deftly sketched by Miss Chopin, Edna met Robert Lebrun, son of the landlady, who dreamed of a fortune awaiting him in Mexico while he occupied a petty clerical position in New Orleans. Robert made it his business to be agreeable to his mother's boarders, and Edna, not being a Creole, much against his wish and will, took him seriously. . . . The lover of course disappointed her, was a coward and ran away from his responsibilities before they began. He was afraid to begin a chapter with so serious and limited a woman. She remembered the sea where she had first met Robert. Perhaps from the same motive which threw Anna Karenina under the engine wheels, she threw herself into the sea, swam until she was tired and then let go. . . .

Ten months later, the Chicago Tribune's Maurice Possley and Steve Mills highlighted flaws in the science used to convict Willingham. Three experts they consulted agreed with Hurst. In 2005, Texas established the state Forensic Science Commission to investigate further. The commission hired Dr. Craig L. Beyler to lead the probe, and he would come to agree with Hurst. Beyler lambasted the arson investigation that convicted Willingham, saying it was "characteristic of mystics or psychics." He was not alone.

There are plenty of catches with the free plan. United Online isn't offsetting its costs by making users look at advertising, as it did with its original offer of free dial-up Internet access. The "free" users will be money-losers for the company, United Online Chairman and CEO Mark Goldston said. That means United Online is using the free plan as a way to lure customers with the hope of upselling them to paying plans, which start at $9.95 per month.

Coach Teri Oberg at San Jose City College is one of the best coaches at any college level. I think she could easily be coach of an NCAA Division I team, but family keeps her in San Jose. She was fabulous at getting Natalia and all her players to work toward their full potential. Coach 'O' was a tough taskmaster, but also really got to know her players and had a real understanding and great love for each of them. We'll forever be grateful for the experience of being part of her program.

THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say this. In a Cabinet meeting that we just recently had, I instructed Karen to work with all of our agencies to make sure that we are cutting back on the amount of time that it takes for vendors to get paid to the government, at least at the federal level. So that's where I've got some control.
JOHN KAVANAGH: If the scenario were different, and they were legally arrested for assault, then they would be routinely taken to jail for booking, where all prisoners have their immigration status checked, at least in Maricopa County. If they were in the country illegally, they would be turned over to federal authorities (either in lieu of prosecution or after serving their Arizona sentence).

The league, in a cunning move, dangled a heck of a carrot in front of the players, saying if they take the deal, the league could play a 72-game schedule starting Dec. 15. After months of endless negotiations, of fans growing weary, of arena workers losing income, the thought of actual games, with an actual start date, is so appealing.

This summer, the danger suddenly looked a lot closer. Biologists discovered Asian carp had advanced farther north than previously thought on the Wabash River in Indiana, which has a tributary that seeps into wetlands near Fort Wayne. They say the carp could slip across the marshes during floods and reach the nearby Maumee River. From there, it's a straight shot to Lake Erie.

Potential cuts: And players who might be traded. In this case, we mean RB Brandon Jacobs and DE Osi Umenyiora. Jacobs is owed $4.9 million this season while Umenyiora hasn't been happy about his contract since, roughly, the ink dried back in 2005. Jacobs' situation is more pressing for the Giants because they need to clear salary-cap space and owe him a roster bonus of $500,000 next month. Umenyiora, who is set to earn a base salary of $3.975 million this season, could be left to twist in the wind a bit until draft time in April - or beyond that, should the Giants decide to do nothing and expect him to report to OTAs, minicamp and training camp on time. Still, there could be news on the Jacobs and Umenyiora fronts this weekend. Stay tuned.

The last two episodes leading into the finale tonight have redressed that balance somewhat, with ample moments of gore and the deaths of major characters.

Bavaro's oven hovers around 900 degrees. It's 850 over at Anthony's, that kind of heat cooking the pies quickly and adding a nutty, charry flavor to the dough. Twelve-inchers and 16-ers at Anthony's (only 12 over at Bavaro, kind of a large one-person size), each one getting a luscious mantle of mozzarella and Romano cheese, a little basil, olive oil and crushed plum tomato. At neither place are topping options exhaustive. Nope, no stinkin' ham and pineapple. You can get broccoli rabe and Italian sausage ($15.95 or $18.95) at Anthony's, soppressata and buffalo mozzarella at Bavaro ($15). You can build your own, but you're better off letting the experts concoct one of caramelized onion and provolone at Bavaro ($13), or a specialty pie topped with a bloom of peppery arugula at Anthony's ($15.95 or $18.95).

Obama attributed increasingly optimistic economic forecasts in part to the tax cut deal he negotiated last month with Republicans to extend Bush-era tax rates for all, along with unemployment benefits, a payroll tax cut and assorted other tax breaks. He urged businesses to take advantage of provisions including one that allows businesses to write off 100 percent of their capital investment expenses in 2011. And the president said that the deal stands as an example of how Washington should work as he confronts a Congress where Republicans just assumed the majority in the House and expanded their ranks in the Senate.

In fact, the biggest choice was whether to put the boat in the water this year. With gas prices cresting $4 a gallon in the New Jersey area we live -- and nearing $5 a gallon in California, Florida, and other parts of the country where boating is popular -- more boat owners are choosing to stay off the water this year. A cruise past the waterfront in our area tells the tale: Marinas usually filled to capacity sit half empty, and many of the smaller recreational boats, such as ours, are adorned with "for sale" signs.

So the members of the jury, who have sworn to "diligently inquire into and carefully deliberate all matters between the State of Ohio and the defendant Anthony Sowell," dutifully walked into a scene of horror.

Northwest: Hatchery coho showed in force on the Washington side just above the Astoria-Megler Bridge on Labor Day. Although limits are not consistent, it is the best hatchery coho fishing of the season. Coinciding with this fishery, the Tongue Point chinook bite turned on the next day. Chinook limits were common on Tuesday and Wednesday with many jacks legally retained as well.
