And Tannenbaum has to answer for that. He has to explain how he could be a GM in this league for six years, how he could be an executive in the league for 15 years, and — at best — allow what the Jets had already turned a done deal into something else and — at worst — not notice the fine print in Tebow’s contract that explained that trading for him could cost the Jets an extra $5 million.

Last week, California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris asked DeMarco to suspend foreclosures in this state until he analyzes the results of the five top banks' new approach to principal forgiveness. DeMarco refused on Monday, but he should reconsider. His own data show that Fannie and Freddie aren't moving boldly enough to modify mortgages and avert unnecessary foreclosures. That hurts borrowers, their neighbors and the taxpayers who are stuck with Fannie and Freddie's tab.
The first revelation came from Dr. Nassir Ghaemi of Tufts University. In his recent book, "A First-Rate Madness," he went beyond merely restating the old adage that anyone crazy enough to run for public office probably shouldn't occupy that office. Instead, the book sheds light on what Ghaemi calls an "inverse law of sanity," whereby tumultuous times like these actually reward and promote political figures who are "mentally abnormal (or) even ill."

The rush to home equity loans, where homeowners borrow against the equity in their home to finance other expenditures, and the recent decline in home values have left some homeowners owing more to their lender than their home is worth in today's market. If this is the situation you find yourself in and you need to sell, you may approach your lender about accepting less than you owe on your house in exchange for releasing the lender's lien on your home so you can sell it at market value or what is commonly called a 'short sale." While this may be a solution for you, there are many things you should know about the short sale process.

It’s been over a year now, and I still haven’t purchased a newer, bigger piece of equipment that will give me the ultimate satisfaction in hair removal, and a cleaner, more polished space to dwell. So the other day I tried a friend’s bigger vacuum. It felt powerful; this would surely be what I’ve been looking for. The first day I vacuumed my whole place with it, and sure enough it worked! I went to sleep that night feeling whole, feeling that perhaps the satisfaction of a clean apartment would put me at rest.

I just wish people would try to make more of an effort in general. I don't like a sloppy, lazy look. I'm not a big rule follower, except for some important things. Jammies aren't pants; they belong at home, so if you're going out, get dressed. Also, fit is crucial. Use a tailor if you need one; don't let pants drag. Don't worry about sizes, go by what fits and feels good. I don't wear turtlenecks. I'll wear white after Labor Day and won't do denim on denim. Oh, and leggings, they're back and that's OK but you've got to cover your behind -- wear a tunic with cool shoes or boots. I like a pop of color; I don't do all black or all dark colors. I don't want to fade away. I like a surprising color. I love red shoes, especially with blue. To me, red shoes go with everything -- except for this shirt I'm wearing.

The second suggestion is having the Illinois Commerce Commission consider eliminating cost increases for people who don't choose to take advantage of the smart meter technology. That is a very disconcerting idea. Smart grid development and smart meter deployment is a multi-billion-dollar, 10-year infrastructure project. When we all chip in to build other infrastructure projects -- like building a better road or extending the reach of public transportation -- everyone pays to have the project built and various groups benefit in different, sometimes unequal ways. In addition, people who do nothing will still reap the benefits of an upgraded system even if they don't choose to take advantage of smart meter opportunities.

My biggest quibble was how well-done many of the meats were. Flank steak and lamb chops were pink and succulent. A bone-in rib steak was juicy and terrific on our second visit, but the same cut was overcooked on a busy Saturday night.

Keep in mind that these surveys can be dicey. Good pollsters want to interview only the people who will really turn out, and that's much harder to discern in a caucus than a primary or general election, because a caucus requires so much more of the voters. A trip to the polls takes a few minutes; you can even vote by mail. But a caucus in one of Iowa's 1,774 precincts can easily mean spending a couple of hours in a gymnasium on a wintry January night.

Speaking of cash, Leap Year should be good for investments because your money has an additional day to accrue interest. If you have a $5,000 CD at today's standard 1 percent rate, you just earned about 13 more cents. Of course, that'll be quickly wiped out by having to pay for another day of heat and electricity. And who decided that Leap Day should be in February? Was somebody feeling sorry for it because it was already the shortest month? If they would have awarded the spare 24 hours to June, we could have an extra day to keep the swimming pools open every fourth summer.
Unlike other schools, where teachers input attendance data into a centralized computer system, Veal had teachers take attendance on paper attendance forms.

So now you have asked the Legislature to change the law to make it crystal clear that you can, indeed, meet with the governor in private to discuss threats to public buildings and public services, and then you, Assembly — we didn't forget you — passed the bill last week and sent it to the Senate.

The SCAA plays a home-and-home format for league games, a 10-game commitment. Playing as an independent opens several dates on Maplewood's schedule. Hill said those open dates were quickly snapped up. Corey Frazier just finished his tenth year as the Blue Devils head coach, and with two state banners and another talented class of seniors returning, Maplewood is an interesting scheduling catch for opponents.

Jelen added that people who pay attention to some of the background will get a better sense of how complicated it is to run a high-volume metal plant.
The losing streak goes on and the pitching line would have you think it's Groundhog Day, so it's probably fair at this point to look at his numbers and say that they are what they are and stop trying to make excuses for why they are what they are. Matusz allows way too many baserunners and he isn't finishing enough hitters, so he's complicent in what is happening to him early in this new season even if he isn't entirely to blame.

"I'm constantly aware of the fact, for instance, if I look back on my children as little people, they basically died. ... I'm so happy to have them as grown-ups, but they're other people, totally other people," she says. "It's paradoxical, too. I often have the feeling that I'm 7. ... I turned 70 on my last birthday, and I thought, just looking out through my own eyes, not at myself in the mirror, 'I'm 7, how did this happen?' "

Adducci is surrounded by an ensemble of regulars who nail their idiosyncratic characters, even if we have seen shades of these performances in other shows.

Snook, a defense attorney in Charlottesville who has been blogging about the case on his firm's website, is close to Lawrence and understandably a bit pained to criticize him.

PBS's Idea Channel posted an amusing YouTube commentary recently asking the question: Who's more authentic, Lana Del Rey or Hatsune Miku? The latter is a computer-generated avatar, and the conclusions weighed in "her" favor. Trying to be something you're not - that's inauthentic, surely. But what if the music you want to make is unavoidably anachronistic? Thankfully, in an iPod-shuffled age, the temporal connection of most musical eras and genres is moot, so an album like Jill Barber's latest, "Mischievous Moon," can be unabashedly imitative and utterly honest. A stirring cocktail of Patsy Cline and Edith Piaf, this Toronto-based vocalist simply moves forward from a much earlier point of reference, building on 1960s lighter-than-air orchestrated jazz-pop. Her honeyed voice glides through romantic reveries ("Chances," "Never Quit Loving You," "A Wish Under My Pillow") and the occasional bold step (the gospel 'n' vibes of "Oh My My"). Around every satin-cushioned corner, she gives us an irony-free wink. (If she'd have sung "Zou Bisou Bisou," no one would have laughed or squirmed.) "Mischievous Moon" could have come out 35 years ago instead of this week, and it would rate as highly either way.
That day has arrived and it is taking over our tiny yard. We need to prune it, but I'm a bit in a quandary about the best approach. I've been pruning roses for years, so I have an idea about shaping, etc., but would really appreciate some tips.

Remember how Russell Westbrook torched the Blazers last season, making Andre Miller look 50 while averaging 27 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.0 assists in four games? Well, now the Blazers have Felton, whose speed -- both offensively and defensively -- neutralizes Westbrook just enough to take away a huge advantage. Westbrook still got his Tuesday night -- 22 points, six rebounds and eight assists -- but nine of the points were late and much of his night was spent trying to beat Felton, not the Blazers.

The rites that we perform help to create our sense of identity. It's true on the level of family: my family has a sung prayer that we learned from my grandparents. Now, when we we gather with my parents on holidays, my mother leads the singing. Each time I sing that prayer my sense of identity in that specific family is strengthened. The same thing is at work in church. When I participate in Christian tradition I feel a bond between myself and Christians not only around the world, but through time. I remember what my family name really is, and where I belong. There are competing allegiances at work in and around us all the time, telling us that we are first of all Americas, first of all employees, first of all consumers. Those allegiances are promoted through liturgy and tradition, as well: through songs, ceremonies, symbols, holidays, even advertising that creates a shared sense of identity. The liturgy and traditions of the church remind us again and again of who we are "first of all" - citizens of another Kingdom, servants of the King.

Andy Griffith applies a thick layer of aw-shucks back-country charm to his portrayal of Georgia hillbilly Will Stockdale, a U.S. Army draftee, in this knee-slapping 1958 comedy.

Based on Mac Hyman's novel, the story was also turned into a long-running Broadway play and a live TV broadcast and clearly influenced the 1964 CBS sitcom "Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."
