The Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit, which passed in 2009, essentially reimburses productions for 25 percent of what they spend in the state and 35 percent of wages paid to Ohio residents. Each project has a tax credit limit of $5 million. "Marvel's The Avengers" (called simply "The Avengers" when it filmed here) actually received $8.1 million in total credits for fiscal year 2011: $4.5 million for the Cleveland shoot and about $3.6 million for scenes shot in Wilmington and Sandusky, which the state considered separate projects.

Yet capping is not new. It has been shown to work if customized to a particular location in the river. Portland's best example is the Willamette's riverbed near the OMSI and the popular submarine, where carcinogenic PCBs lie beneath sand topped by rocks put in place more than two decades ago. Monitoring shows things to be holding.

At Zephyr Cove Lodge, 28 cabins sit only a few dozen yards from the lake. Our cabin could sleep six, easily, with a large master bedroom and upstairs loft. Especially useful were the fully functioning kitchen and large gas fireplace in the living room, both of which came in handy during our stay. Next to a large general store, which doubles as the registration desk, is the lodge's restaurant and bar, with wide windows allowing for lake views and a surprisingly abundant menu. Like anything with the word "lodge" in its name should, portions are hefty and range from fresh fish and burgers to Mexican fare.

This recipe is based on one I got years ago from Charles Dale, now the chef at Encantado Resort in Santa Fe, N.M. Although I don't think Charles had grilled cheese sandwiches in mind when he created the recipe, I feel pretty certain he'd wholeheartedly approve of its use for just that purpose. Note that you can make this a week in advance and refrigerate it. Also, you'll have more jam than you need for one batch of sandwiches. You can use the extra to make more sandwiches, and it's also great with salmon or on hamburgers.

øA: I'm not against bonds or annuities if you are willing to put more of your current income into an annuity. If you put it into an annuity or some form of bonds, you're just going to have to put more of your disposable income away.

After a checkup on Thursday, less than three weeks after she was released from a rehabilitation hospital, Iacono declared Tori a normal teen — lip ring, blue nail polish, red hair and all.
Typically male models come and go unnoticed. A handsome, young face in a Gucci ad one season is replaced with another the next. Modeling is one of the only job markets in which women have the upperhand financially. Women make more, often double, triple or more than their male counterparts, and women of equal caliber will outlast men in similar ratios.

While the case is in some ways similar to the thwarted state Senate candidacy of former Olympic track and field star Carl Lewis – who was kicked off the ballot for state Senate in September – there is a key difference. Lewis did not meet the state’s two-year state residency requirement for Senate candidates. That particular residency requirement had never been overruled in federal court, unlike the district residency requirement.

Early last year I visited this new Vienna three times from nearby Bratislava. Last decade started with a bang in 2001, when the former imperial stables outside the Rinsgtrasse, the stately ring road circling the Innerestadt or "inner city," became MuseumsQuartier, one of the world's 10 biggest cultural centers.
Speaking of which: Outside, they’re adding a new wing to the original monolith — increasing its square footage from 80,000 to 120,000, just to accommodate the needed office space.

The stock market's big rally to kick off the year has already surpassed many stock strategists' 2012 forecasts. Now, some say the market is ripe for a pullback before it can push higher.
“New Jersey’s voters will have a very clear choice if Senator Kyrillos becomes the Republican nominee- Senator Bob Menendez who fights every day for middle class New Jersey families or long-time Trenton insider Joe Kyrillos- who sides with corporations and special interests over working families and seniors and panders to the most extreme elements of the Washington Republicans," Lawrence said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Oden had an arthroscopic procedure in Vail to clean out debris in his right knee.

Descended from French brothers Louis and Pierre Pellier, who are said to have brought the first Pinot Noir grapes to California in the 1850s, Steven Kent Mirassou belongs to one of the longest-established winery families in the country. Mirassou's two wineries share the same space, but the wines are distinctly different. For his eponymous label, small lots of Cabernet Sauvignon are the specialty; while Pinot Noir, sourced from vineyards throughout California and Oregon, is the focus at La Rochelle. Two tasting options are available: $10 for four pours in the Barrel Room or sample four wines, paired with hand-selected cheeses in the Reserve Room ($20).

Jurors returned to Common Pleas Judge Dick Ambrose’s courtroom this week for the sentencing, or mitigation, phase of the trial. During this stage, defense attorneys call witnesses whose testimony could humanize Sowell in the hopes of persuading the jury to spare him the death penalty.
This is the bicentennial year of Charles Dickens' birth. We need no reminder of his eminence as novelist, but there are celebrations of his other attainments as well. "The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens" is part of that. As its editor observes, a 12-volume edition of letters already exists; it took from 1965 to 2002 to compile the British Academy Pilgrim Edition "The Letters of Charles Dickens." Although in September 1860 the writer made a bonfire of personal papers in a field at his house, Gad's Hill, some 14,000 missives survived. The Pilgrim Edition contains them all (newly discovered letters have been published as supplements in the journal the Dickensian); this new edition of selections amounts to a "mere" 450 examples of the master's epistolary prose. None but the librarian or obsessive devotee of Dickens' work need thumb through all 12 volumes, but many will want this smaller edition to own. Its annotations are useful; its print is — for these eyes, at least — too small; it offers the author writ large.
Dec. 9, 1977: Kermit Washington punches Rudy Tomjanovich in the face:

A 10-year-old refrigerator, for example, uses twice the electricity of a newer model with an Energy Star rating. And you'll save more than $30 a year on your electric bill if you replace a pre-1994 dishwasher with an Energy Star-qualified new one. You might even want to replace older appliances even if they're not acting up.
Step-by-step videos hosted by culinary arts professor Judy Parks show how to make three of the 10 dessert recipes (raspberry napoleon hearts, flourless chocolate cappuccino cake, chocolate mousse).

Interesting that they would reveal the man arriving by helicopter is Kalon and not (as the preview would have you suspect) Bentley.

One of his findings, he said, is that "ads that attack Obama too personally turn people off in ways that will keep them turned off."
Instead of focusing on Albert and his contract, perhaps we should think about the needs of the vulnerable members of our community and those who work with them. I'm thinking about those living in poverty, the homeless, the mentally and physically challenged, victims of abuse and neglect and other froms of violence. Of course, worrying about Albert and his contract is easier than thinking about these individuals. While Albert and other professional athletes entertain us for the duration of a season, a large cadre of dedicated people work daily providing needed services to our vulnerable neighbors. The case managers at agecnies like Places for People/Community Alternatives help people deal with the challenges of everyday living. Volunteers provide pro bono counseling services to victims of torture and war trauma. Staff and volunteers run after school programs for at risk youth. These are but a few examples. The critical work of these people goes unnoticed. Service providers employed in public and private agencies continure to work for wages that don't begin to reflect the importance of their contribution to the welfare of the St. Louis community.
While Park increased its sales last year, the company kept its costs low. Expenses grew by 14 percent, slightly less than the growth in sales. Keeping costs low helped Park expand its profit margin as its markets improved.

However, Wilson is far from alone in thinking that the prohibition in the House bill doesn't go far enough. For him and other Republicans, the problem is not what's in the bill, it's what the bill leaves out. There's no provision for how the prohibition would be enforced, or any requirement for people to prove they are citizens or legal residents before getting health care benefits. In fact, Democrats on the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committees defeated Republican-offered amendments that would have required people to verify their legal status before getting care, with some Democrats saying such requirements would be unnecessarily burdensome for people legally entitled to coverage. Wilson cited the defeat of those two amendments Thursday when he discussed his outburst with reporters.

It is sadly inevitable that I will read more headlines of U.S. soldiers killed in foreign countries. What possible rationale is there to keep troops in Afghanistan or Iraq?

The Obama administration does not want to appear weak? Maybe!

Another recent trend is for companies to consider fully furnished "plug-and-play" space, much of which became available during the recession as office users downsized or were bought out.

Let’s face it: more money does not necessarily lead to a better education. Today, in Newark, we spend $23,000 per student for instruction and services. But only 23% of ninth graders who enter high school this year will receive high school diplomas in four years. Asbury Park is similar: per pupil costs, at almost $30,000 a year, are nearly 75% above the state average. But the dropout rate is almost 10 times the state average. And math S.A.T. scores lag the state average by 180 points.

Keeping that pain to a minimum, and ensuring that the right cuts are being made, should be the Legislature's focus now as it turns Quinn's proposal into passable legislation.

Although three-quarters of the American public, almost all serious historians and even the U.S. House of Representatives have concluded that JFK was killed as the result of a conspiracy, Matthews continues to peddle the company line that a lone nut with a lousy rifle achieved an incomparable shooting feat, was linked to the crime by an unblemished bullet that didn't have a trace of blood on it and was coincidentally silenced by a patriotic strip-club owner with no mob connections.

It is a sorry state of affairs when Wall Street reacts to Standard and Poor’s downgrading of the U.S. government. What standing does S&P have in the credit rating world, when it was so clearly exposed for its active participation with brokerage houses in the mortgage scandal that brought down the U.S. economy? Its rating is suspect at best, but Wall Street is using that as an excuse for Monday’s market collapse. The downgrading of the U.S. government is a permanent scar on this great country’s standing.

On Sunday night’s show — one dedicated to a year in music that was brightly decorated by hip-hop — rappers were barely represented. Network censors bleeped out significant portions of Eminem’s verses. Drake appeared as Rihanna’s accompanist. B.o.B sang through most of his spotlight number and then, as if to reassure the audience that he was an old-fashioned musician at heart, strummed a guitar.

Judging by the scene at the Dome and the convention center Thursday, it's a growing addiction.

They are diligent in their quest, willing to be led by the presence of God.

So far this season, if Felton and Crawford aren't turning the ball over in bunches, they are missing shots like a fan during a timeout promotion.

As much as I love that story about Dom Pérignon, we now know it's just a myth. He didn't invent the process for making Champagne nor say anything about drinking stars. However, one thing is true. The magic of tiny bubbles rising in a flute of sparkling wine continues today. And luckily for those of us living in the United States, we can experience the traditional technique used in Champagne in our own country, particularly in California, the largest domestic producer of sparkling wine.

Feves' earthy sculptures of the 1940s and 1950s reflected her most basic experiences as both a mother and as a resident of the arid eastern Oregon landscape. She repeatedly turned to the female figure, depicted as hulking and sensuous by way of Picasso, while images from nature crept into her formal vocabulary: slabs and stones, stalks, pods and flowers, which are likely a further abstraction of the female figure. For Feves, both motherhood and the eastern Oregon wilds offered practical but purposeful metaphors for the creative life, modeling invention and growth close to home.

It's easy to succumb in a city that has a beach lapping its southeastern edge, where even the ham — procured from black-hoofed pigs fattened on acorns — is a sensual experience. Start the day at Mercat de Santa Catarina, eyeing ripe figs and fleshy peaches. Then slip into Cuines Santa-Catarina and devour oily sardines and garlicky bread smeared with succulent tomatoes. Afterward, siesta at Hotel Omm, where the minimalist aesthetic won't get in the way of your own Gaudí-inspired fantasies.

Hey, Tony: I think the Browns, assuming everything magically works in their favor, should draft Justin Blackmon at No. 4 and Michael Floyd at No. 22. Although it would be risky, if one works out the team would be in great position in the future. If both work out ... well that'd be a Browns fan's dream! Then 2013 can be used to find a QB (if necessary), and at that point the next QB or McCoy would be working with established NFL wide receivers. -- Kyle Chormanski, Los Angeles

Comment: Anger is versatile in the sense that he uses a wide variety of punting styles. He's capable of executing both Australian-style and rugby kicks that should help him angle punts toward the sidelines inside the 20-yard line. One downside of these methods, though, is an occasional lack of height on kicks. He tends to drive the ball more than loft it, which could lead to some shanked kicks at the next level.
At the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War, he headed the international relief efforts for the Iraqi Kurds who were pushed into the inhospitable mountains along the Turkish border by Saddam Hussein's forces.

What follows is Griffiths' account of the Hot-Time Swingers' being branded degenerates and bottled up in a club after a violent encounter with German police. Slowly losing members to tragedy or circumstance, the group makes a tense escape to France after catching the eye of Louis Armstrong, who appears as a wise but crumbling monarch in a Parisian apartment. Along the way Griffiths and Falk get tangled with one of Armstrong's associates, a beautiful singer named Delilah, who falls into a turbulent relationship with Griffiths that all too easily brings out the envy and insecurity in his artistry with ugly, disastrous results.

It is time for a little history lesson. In 1775 King George III so vehemently opposed the colonists having any say in who should act on their behalf that he hired Hessian troops to kill their nascent desire to have a modicum of representation in Parliament. The result was a revolution that cost King George the most valuable part of the British Empire.

The article comes as the nation's obesity experts are casting about for better ways to measure the nation's state of health and to judge the success or failure of treatment programs. In the past year alone, researchers have proposed a wide range of alternatives to the BMI, and increasingly used them to measure the effectiveness of interventions such as weight-loss counseling, exercise regimens and drug therapies. Simple measures such as waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratios have gained new adherents as criticism of BMI has mounted.
There’s also a lot of scream-and-break-stuff theatrics. Of course, this is the third movie opening today (after “The Town” and “Leaves of Grass”) directed by one of its stars — and the worst at giving in to stop-the-show, look-at-me performing.
Productivity is another major force reshaping manufacturing. As factories have grown more high-tech, they have also grown more productive. In the two decades leading up to the Great Recession, labor productivity in manufacturing roughly doubled. But of course, higher-tech factories require fewer workers. Even as output rose 65 percent, labor hours fell 20 percent, and a total of 3.7 million jobs disappeared in the decades leading up to the Great Recession. But thanks to our increases in productivity, we remain a very competitive manufacturing nation.

Meanwhile, there's no sign that another key element in the GOP budget will advance this year. It's a tax plan promising sharply lower rates in exchange for eliminating many popular tax breaks. The GOP tax reform plan would lower the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, but at the risk of eliminating deductions on mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local taxes. It's simply too controversial and difficult to do in a hyper-polarized election year.

Such tastings  and rankings  are subjective and unscientific. For instance, to "pull" a great espresso takes both skill and a bit of luck. But the discerning barista will pour out a poor espresso and redo the pull until a good or very good one is realized. We considered the body or mouthfeel of the coffee, the aroma, the complexity of pleasing flavors, as well as the finish. A great espresso takes seconds to drink, but the flavor coats the mouth and should last for some time.

That video also questions whether Romney would've made the same decision -- repeating his comments from 2007 in which he said it wasn't worth spending billions "just trying to catch one person."

“One of the things that interested me was how this story dealt with the way we do things we don’t want to do, and we even know aren’t good for us,” says Affleck, 38. “It’s hard to change, and having that kind of self-knowledge while you’re still doing things you know are harmful — that’s a very interesting thing to play.”
"From 2004 till now it's been a frantic domestic sprint," White explained. "The hurricane hit Pensacola in 2004 and destroyed the town and did a lot of damage to my house, and my ex, right in the middle of it, told me she was sick of this place and was moving somewhere else with my daughter, so I had to desperately fix my house up and try to sell it and then move to Athens and live in an apartment and look for a house and buy a house and renovate a house and get married and have a baby. It was a landslide of stuff. It's just been a desperate scramble, and I'm just burning the last of the garage, and after that there's not much to do."

But Rubin's involvement has not gone unnoticed. Late last year, Ohio's attorney general filed a lawsuit in Hernando County to force Rubin, a resident of Weeki Wachee, to answer questions and turn over documents in connection with that state's investigation into the Navy Veterans. Though three other attorneys retained by Navy Vets agreed to be deposed, Rubin cited attorney-client privilege. In February, a Hernando County judge ordered her to comply.

"You can't win if you don't have a kicker," former Green Bay quarterback Zeke Bratkowski told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "It wasn't called 'throw the ball' or 'run the ball.' It was called 'football.' He worked at it. It wasn't easy. Green Bay is cold. But he made so many clutch kicks."

But unlike the Ritz or Silo Point, Pier Homes did not have certificates of occupancy. Either way, the head of the independent panel that reduced the Pier Homes values said he cannot believe that the assessments agency would treat one of its decisions as a precedent for other properties.
Lindsay, who says he's "not a fan of the show," says the home was indeed listed for $1.495 million last year but taken off the market. Because of the maintenance issues mentioned before -- the roof and the furnace haven't been replaced since the home was built in 1989, the pool has issues -- he listed it at $1.095, an aggressive price, he says, in a "tough segment of the market." You mean high-end real estate, or homes owned by notorious real estate stars?
When one of those nine-pointed models finally satisfied McVey, he asked for a full-scale plywood model. Kubin and the other carpenter built the 34-foot high wooden star on the ground, then they measured that model to calculate the dimensions the stonecutters should use. In the end, it turned out that not one piece of stone in the strange star would be set either plum or level. But it worked: From the ground, it seemed just right, as inevitable as Jesse Jones' will.

Cavalia's glossy horses arrived in St. Louis on Thursday and were introduced to media. Some eagerly welcomed attention from strangers, testing the strength of a notebook or taste of a blouse with their mouths. Others, manes protected in braids and tails kept clean in tailbags, focused on fresh hay or their trainers.
Then there were the video parodies, the best of which was "Broke Mac Mountain," about manly love in Appleland. And let us not neglect the countless film-poster manipulations, culminating in art imitating life imitating art with a New Yorker magazine cover illustration showing Dick Cheney and the unfortunate, shot-in-the-face Harry Whittington striking a Jack-and-Ennis pose.

The rookie trio had just learned they had made their first NFL roster. They quickly became close friends, hanging out with each other away from the locker room. With training camp and the preseason finished and the team hotel no longer available, Cox and Vaughn moved into a Lone Tree apartment in September 2010. Thomas, who was still shopping for a place, would frequently sleep on an air mattress in the apartment's living room.
The current to do over airline screening simply obfuscates the intent of this administration to form a “powerful, strong and well-funded civilian force equal to our military” – his words not mine. Why he digressed from his prepared remarks to posit such a stunning declaration is a mystery, undaunted hubris perhaps. Nonetheless, having moved the TSA from the Department of Transportation, as originally designated, to the Department of Homeland Security signifies the objective, a civilian security force. Thus, broadening the scope of their activities beyond simply transportation.
Ultimately, "Game Change" is a movie about the emotional booby traps to which all of us are prone. If you missed its premier last weekend, watch one of the encore broadcasts that continue to air most nights on one or more of the HBO stations, preferably with a partner, colleague or teenage child.

After weighing the evidence, the jury concluded BNSF was negligent and mostly responsible for the accident. The jury awarded a total of $9 million to Pietrowski, including $2 million in punitive damages.

But when the game ended, the night turned ugly. And without warning, Sowell began choking her so hard tears poured from her eyes. He told her to knock three times on the floor if she wanted to live, she said. And when she did, he released his grip. Then, he slapped her across the face and commanded, "Bitch! Take off your clothes!"
Truck driver Jaime Musso, 53, thought his truck was being buffeted by strong winds and by the time he saw the overpass hanging down over Highway 5 there was no chance of stopping, so he aimed for the spot where he thought he would cause the least damage and brought down the overpass onto his truck. He said he survived "by millimeters."

Katy Perry recently took "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)," a song with a brief saxophone solo, to the top of the Billboard charts. Lady Gaga enlisted Clarence Clemons, the Big Man himself, to play on "Hair" and "The Edge of Glory." These records won't make you forget about "Jungleland," but they do suggest that the sax prohibition on mainstream radio is easing a bit. Now in the year of the modest saxophone revival, Romanian dance-pop singer Alexandra Stan arrives on these shores with "Mr. Saxobeat." The song has already hit No. 1 in several European and Asian countries, and it’s making a beeline for the U.S. Top 10.
"I don't want a donation from Councilman Cimperman. I need him to just get the legislation passed and make it a little easier. This is ridiculous," Whalen said.

Notable: Came back this season two inches taller, but his game hasn't grown.

That's the way it's going to be. While special teams rarely win games by themselves, no matter how dominant (see: 2004-08 Bills, 2009-10 Browns), it's important to note that bad special teams can submarine a season (2010 Chargers).
Once again, though, the legislature wants to fix a system that isn't broken. Missouri's selection system has consistently produced distinguished judges who have served the state and the public well. Recently, the Supreme Court passed rules aimed at increasing transparency in the selection process. There is no reason to politicize judicial selection by giving the governor unilateral power to control the commission through his appointees.

In February 2008, the county sued the deputy sheriff's union in a landmark effort to erase the expensive "3 at 50" formula for police.

The county also argued that the plan was illegal because it spent general fund money without voter approval.

Colleen Bridges said she transferred her fourth-grade son and seventh-grade daughter from St. Joan of Arc for financial reasons. She also considered selling her house in the next year and moving to St. Louis County.
Frusciante's departure wasn't publicly known, and it was hardly the band's first season of turmoil. The original Chili Peppers quartet of friends from Fairfax High was shattered by the 1988 heroin overdose of guitarist Hillel Slovak and the grief-stricken exit of drummer Jack Irons. Those next years saw a series of comings and goings, including one player who threatened to burn down Kiedis' house, and an uneasy period with Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. All of it swirled around the creative core of Flea and Kiedis, who ultimately found their greatest, most lasting successes with Frusciante and Smith.

In Portland, Ore., is the easy answer. With a filmmaking husband and two children. But how she got there is at the heart of "Wild." She literally walked there more than 15 years ago, with nothing to call her own except a creaky backpack she named Monster that weighed half as much as she did. Her feet blistered painfully, she lost six toenails and developed palm-sized calluses on her hip bones that resembled a cross between "tree bark and a plucked dead chicken."
Rather than mope before heading home, though, Pam Nordin said, "It's a bummer, but we're still going to celebrate. Mike's still turning 40, so we'll have breakfast, get dry and go to his son's violin concert."
There is no one more tired of the endless debate than the residents of the area where the plaza is "alleged" to be built.

But her answer surprised me. She cited a simple bowl of noodles as one of her favorite things to eat in New York City: "The place is sort of a dive, but they make this incredible bowl of noodle soup, kind of like Thai tom yum, but with loads of seafood and tomatoes, like French bouillabaisse. It's in no way authentic or fancy, but I could eat it every day."
