So thank goodness for Ke$ha -- the rare pop star whose personality is so big that it transcends the roles she's been given, and maybe even the one she's written for herself. In her short career so far, Ke$ha has been the party girl, she's been the motivational speaker, and she's even tried (somewhat unsuccessfully) to play detached; but whatever she does, she remains Ke$ha Rose Sebert first and her industry-recognized role only after that. If she's managed this by making herself a live-action cartoon, remember that there's considerably more character depth to Bugs Bunny than there is to, say, the latest version of Rihanna as broadcast on "S&M." Cartoons get a bad rap. A caricature has communicative power precisely because it is exaggerated; it's outsized, larger-than-life, non-realist, borderline silly. Just like pop music.

"Legislators don't have time to get to know the issues in depth, and feel the demand to raise money to campaign for a new office once they are termed out.

Drug company sales reps cannot legally promote drug uses not yet approved, but plenty have done so. Some drugs have had much higher sales for such unapproved, "off-label" uses than for approved uses.
Before doctors could do the surgery, they had to pinpoint the lesions in her brain, drill a hole and then target the path of the laser using a clamp and a probe, perfecting the angle and approach down to fractions of a millimeter. After hours of preparation, a two-centimeter stretch of her hippocampus was burned out in a matter of minutes by the red-hot tip of the laser as it pulled out of her skull by degrees. The MRI readings showed the heat from the laser. At the end of several minutes, her surgeon stared up at the monitor, nodding at what he saw.
Consider his favorite new issue, whether President Obama was born in the United States. It’s a position that makes regular Republican leaders cringe.

Mettler organized the book into seven tomboy style archetypes. The "rebels" are rocker chicks Deborah Harry, Courtney Love and Patti Smith, poet laureate of punk, who would buy an expensive coat and immediately throw it into the washing machine to distress it and make it her own. The "sophisticates" include Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, Diane Keaton, Janelle Monae and tomboy godmother Coco Chanel, who turned a fascination with borrowing duds from her paramours into a new way of dressing and introduced it as sportswear to the women of the world.

"The Lucky One" is the edgiest-ever film adaptation of the writings of Nicholas Sparks. Which isn't saying much. Beth (Taylor Schilling) is a willowy and gorgeous single mom running a kennel with her speak-her-mind/ state-the-obvious grandma (Blythe Danner). Logan (Zac Efron) is a brooding ex-soldier, and chivalrous. "Isn't he chivalrous, dear?" granny says, elbowing Beth. Logan found Beth's photo in the dust after a firefight in Iraq. He lost comrades that day, and one of them had her photo. Logan manages to track Beth down in Louisiana. Director Scott Hicks ("Shine," "Snow Falling on Cedars") lifts this material above the "Dear John"/ "Message in a Bottle"/ "Last Song" source, but just barely. -ROGER MOORE, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE

Bylsma's players haven't done him any favors with their pathetic play, but they really sabotaged him by losing their cool in Game 3. Letang's selfish fight might have been the start of it, but there was so much more, so much worse. Arron Asham took a cheap cross-check on the Flyers' Brayden Schenn, punched him in the head when he was down and was thrown out of the game. Later, James Neal took dirty runs at the Flyers' Sean Couturier and Giroux in the same shift. Asham and Neal are looking at suspensions for Game 4. Craig Adams already is out of that game because he instigated a fight with the Flyers' Scott Hartnell in the final five minutes. That's as it should be. Asham and Neal should be suspended, as well. They embarrassed themselves and the Penguins organization.

Furthermore, most wines contain some level of sulfites anyway since they are a naturally occurring byproduct of fermentation.

IN the two years since Foxy Shazam’s single “Unstoppable” was featured on the 2010 Super Bowl telecast, the Cincinnati band has flipped their heavy glam-rock style into plain heavy. That’s especially apparent on “Welcome to the Church of Rock and Roll” off their “The Church of Rock and Roll” CD. The tune is a powerhouse of head-banging rhythms, crunchy guitar work worthy of Deep Purple and vocals that touch on the late Freddie Mercury’s bombast. Foxy’s lead singer/frontman Eric Nally delivers pure rock-star cynicism in a strangled scream when he wails: “You’re all suckers, a flock of sheep, I’ll be your shepherd, follow me.” Even though he’s biting the hand that feeds, he has a gutsy delivery, and the band has a knack for mainstream thrash that’s always kept the pews filled at the Church of Rock ’n’ Roll.

Not to fall back into the habit of over-quoting Tony La Russa but it may be appropriate in this case. The former skipper would always warn that a hitter loses himself when he tries to hit homers. That's true for Colby Rasmus, true for Mark McGwire, true for Rafael Furcal, and true for Albert Pujols. The pressure on him to hit a homer seems to grow with every ESPN special report on his outage. And the more he tries to hit one - to satisfy himself, to silence the media, to fulfill his contract, to carry his teammates - the worse his swing looks. He's expanded his zone. He's so pull happy a shift has been used. You can tell Pujols is struggling when he's a 5-3 waiting to happen. That said, he's famous for getting hot and staying hot and going on a power jag. Thirty is still possible, but with each passing game, each fruitless at-bat, each walk not taken, he's increasing the pressure on him to produce while decreasing the likelihood he will. When he runs into one and relaxes, why then all Halo will break loose ...

Environmentalists — who were anticipating at least a five-year ban at the beginning of the busy legislative day — were livid at the decision. Some said a one-year fracking ban was a "public relations stunt" or "pure politics" that leaves New Jersey open to future water pollution.
"A lot of it is their defense, and a lot of it is our starters are coming out of the locker room with nothing in terms of energy," coach Stan Van Gundy said Monday night. "And so, we're gonna have to talk about that. They're absolutely bringing nothing to the game at the start of the third quarter. Nothing."

"I loved 'The West Wing,' but at this particular point, I think that portrayal of Washington as a clean and noble heartland just wouldn't wash with the public," said "Veep" creator Armando Iannucci, who previously wrote and directed the political farce "In the Loop." "We've seen too much now."
Brower splits his time between Folsom and the Uhrhammer homestead hard by the Merced River south of Turlock, where he grows almonds and walnuts on 40 acres. His wife's family moved there just after World War II. Since he retired from 30 years as a military contract officer, Brower has been spending more time on the farm.

Winding north along 25 miles of highway with spectacular coastal scenery, we enter Big Sur Valley, a forested inland section that doesn't look like much more than a one-room post office, a $5.50-a-gallon gas station, a bakery and a few unexciting-looking motels — at least from the inside of a car going 55 mph.

The draft picks fell in a way that tested the Broncos' patience as they waited at No. 25. The three top-rated defensive tackles went No. 11 (Dontari Poe, Kansas City Chiefs), No. 12 (Fletcher Cox, Philadelphia) and No. 14 (Michael Brockers, St, Louis). The Broncos were hoping either Poe or Brockers would fall, but they also figured both would be gone by No. 25.A cornerback also was under consideration, but after Morris Claiborne went to Dallas at No. 6, Stephon Gilmore went No. 10 to Buffalo and Dre Kirkpatrick went No. 17 to Cincinnati, the Broncos were forced to wait at least one more day to add depth at this position. Kirkpatrick had been on the Broncos' radar since before the season started. He slid some as the Alabama corner didn't have one interception in 2011.

The county plan -- to boost economic development through strategic investments -- is sorely needed but does not affect the principal issue: the Catch-22 defect in our home-rule system of government.
But Verrilli never had a chance. This was never a serious legal challenge in the first place. It was confected (and timed) purely for political effect, to highlight immigration as a campaign issue with which to portray Republicans as anti-Hispanic. Hispanics are just the beginning, however. The entire Obama campaign is a slice and dice operation, pandering to one group after another, particularly those that elected Obama in 2008 – blacks, Hispanics, women, young people – and for whom the thrill is now gone.
Admitted, Jonah Hill has a good handle on self-deprecation and some nice comic timing, but now that he’s cultivated some stubble he’s begun to look like a greedy hamster; any movie that gives him three sex scenes should be rated C for Cruelty.

That's why briskets are rarely sold whole but almost always broken down into more manageable pieces. The logical method would be to separate this massive cut into its two component muscles. That's the procedure endorsed by the North American Meat Processors Association and codified in the NAMP "Meat Buyers Guide," the industry bible.
The same jury will decide on damages later. After issuing its partial verdict on the copyright claims, the jury began listening to opening arguments in the next round of the trial, covering Oracle's allegations that Android violates two Java patents. Those claims are believed to be worth considerably less than what Oracle might have gotten had it prevailed on all of its allegations of copyright infringement.
Obama and wife Michelle paid a rate of 20.5% on their gross income of $789,674. This rate falls between the 30% that the “Buffett rule” proposes that those in similar economic situations pay, and the approximate 14% Romney paid last year. Obama’s secretary, Anita Decker, was confirmed by the White House to have paid a rate slightly higher than that of the president, based on her $95,000 salary.

Tiger can drive a golf ball 400 yards. … And did you hear Phil Mickelson has contacted Elin to pick up some tips on how to beat Tiger? … And what do Tiger Woods and a baby seal have in common? They both get clubbed by Scandinavians. … And police apparently asked Tiger's wife how many times she hit him. She replied, "I don't know exactly, but put me down for a 5." … See what I mean? In one week, Tiger has gone from king of the world to course jester. …

District Court Judge Robert Broomfield had dismissed the case in January under a legal principle that it would interfere with ongoing criminal prosecutions. The 9th Circuit agreed with that interpretation as it relates to the plaintiffs of the suit who have already been charged with conspiracy to commit smuggling. But the other plaintiffs-the advocacy groups Somos America, Friendly House, LULAC and the Arizona Hispanic Community Forum -could still sue to prevent future prosecutions, the appeals court determined.

On most days, there's a line waiting to nab a seat at one of the 18 stools at the counter of this classic seafood diner and retail shop named a James Beard Foundation America's Classic. It's been in the same location since 1912 but in 1946 Sal Sancimino purchased the place; it's now run by his sons and grandsons. They work behind the counter and crack crab and jokes with the ease of Conan O'Brien. The seafood is pristine, whether it's shrimp salad, smoked trout or whole lobster steamed to order and served with drawn butter.

These paintings are different stylistically from one another but work within a guiding principle of an artist always daring to explore and respond to other artists, especially those in the center of the art world at the time, New York.

The two nations' cabinets met on Dec. 10 in the German town of Freiburg, Mr. Schäuble's birthplace. Ms. Merkel told President Nicolas Sarkozy that she had softened to France's longtime desire for closer coordination of economic policy among leaders in the euro zone.

7. On the last tour we did, this one guy came up to me. He'd bought a really expensive VIP ticket, where you get to meet the band. And he came up to me, and he had this T-shirt on that said, "Opeth Rest in Peace: 1990-2010." And I asked (what that was about), and he said, "Well, you're not metal anymore." And he just had this glare. He freaked me out a little bit. He paid the extra money to tell us that we're dead? We had to make sure we had extra security.

One long-term project I have going is a look at how temporary jobs have been increasing in the job market. Temp assignments are getting longer and the opportunities are growing as employers shy away from full-time commitments and the risk of layoffs, say local agencies.

The Browns, who sent eight members of their organization on a private jet to Stillwater, also seem very interested in Oklahoma State quarterback Brandon Weeden.

Drew told ESPN.com's Jason King, "Perry is still young. He's getting stronger. When he's 26 or 28, that's when he's really going to be good. That's why the NBA is so in love with him. They know he's going to get better."

Run up the numbers in the strongly Catholic Republican corridor between Interstate 75 and the Indiana border, advises a Democrat, Steve Fought, who studies winning margins in those little-watched counties. And if you're Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, also spend time along Ohio's eastern border with Pennsylvania and West Virginia because voters know you a little better there, adds Fought, a strategist for U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a Toledo Democrat facing her own election battle.

"Blanch is down!" I yelled to Jacquie. Seventy-year-old Blanch had fallen, but she had fallen in style — on the way down from the summit of 14,495-foot Mt. Whitney. Her 36-pound backpack had her pinned like a turtle. Her lumpy tent sack had come loose and slipped to one side; it had thrown her off-balance and now dangled by a strap. Her soles were caked with dirt. Those sneaker-type boots weren't good for a trip this tough, but that was the only footwear that would fit around her bunions. She was a sight, but there was no time to commiserate.

Using just the right amount of medical lingo, Picoult effectively weaves together the neuroscience of traumatic brain injury with the ethics of potential organ donation. As we read, we can't help but imagine a loved one in Luke's awful situation: "He does have cognition," a doctor explains. But "the other injuries to his brain stem prevent him from being able to access it." Luke's aware brain is severed from any knowledge of his own thinking.

Reading your own opinions and attitudes into scripture (eisegesis) is usually considered a failing, but not by the writers of the Conservative Bible Project. They wave their bias like a flag, having apparently decided that being formed by scripture is less valuable than twisting scripture into political propaganda. Does that mean that conservative ideology has actually become their god? Nothing I say here is going to accurately reflect how bizarre and clumsy and awful this project is. See for yourself.

And, I envision alliances emerging where upriver and downriver groups work closely together to share knowledge and best practices, advocating for main-stem river management improvements and even working with ocean fishers to figure out what harvest levels makes sense in any given cycle to ensure returns that consistently replenish runs and stocks for the benefit of all.

Frieze, which was born in 2003 as an extension of the art magazine, has become the focal point of the British art calendar. It's a venue where seven-figure sales like Hirst's fish are common, but because of its independent point of view, Frieze is also known as a place to discover lesser-known artists.

The Social Security trustees projected this week that funding for retirement benefits will run short in 2033, three years sooner than had been estimated a year ago. After that, the program will be able to pay only about 75% of the amount now promised to retirees and the disabled. That's still a long way off, and lawmakers may not want to meddle with Social Security in an election year. But the longer Congress waits to deal with the problem, the harder it will be to solve.
