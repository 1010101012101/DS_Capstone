In a Capraesque turn, Friedman—at this point, the youngest store manager in the history of the Gap—recalls raising his hand at a crowded company meeting, in response to a question by Drexler. "What's your name?" Drexler barked. "I'm Gary, from the Market Street store," he says, feigning a high, squeaky voice. The next day, Drexler called him at work. Friedman soon found himself at a conference table, ringed by executives. From there he continued the succession of firsts: youngest district manager; youngest regional manager.

I'd never even been to Europe." He says he brought that same prowess for presentation that had served him at the Gap. "I basically doubled the business by taking the same product and presenting it differently." In his eight years in that role, sales at Williams-Sonoma (including Pottery Barn) went from $300 million to $2.1 billion.

Grace will never be ascribed to his defensive play, but Murphy makes a good deal of sense for this team as a second baseman.

Saturday's orchestral program and Sunday afternoon's chamber program, both in Davies Symphony Hall, were studded with exercises in grandiose ambition.

If you send them away, they're back minutes later trying to do the same thing.

After picking a theme, a few unwritten rules will help the party run smoothly -- and save the host's sanity.

The Prince of Wales was once cruelly mocked for allegedly talking to his plants. Today, the man who would be king is listened to seriously when he talks about sustainability issues, especially those involving food production.

Mr. Obama's decision to block the building of the Keystone pipeline on the grounds that the Congress -- in a bipartisan vote -- didn't give the bureaucrats enough time to study the issue is akin to Leslie Groves accepting that he couldn't have his silver because he failed to ask for it in troy ounces.

The lowdown: The No. 20 Beavers were swept over the weekend at 24th-ranked Arizona State and could drop out of the Top 25 for the first time in a month. … In the last dozen games, OSU has won three, lost three, won three and lost three. … This is the Beavers’ first trip to Reno since 2008 – only John Tommasini played in that one (0 for 2). … This two-game series starts a five-game, non-conference stretch for the Beavers, who play host to Arkansas-Pine Bluff this weekend. … Tyler Smith continues to lead the Pac-12 in hitting (.446) and has an 11-game hitting streak.

Skylar singing is definitely the most southern twang I've ever heard on a Whitney Houston song, but overall, it worked — really well. After last week's upbeat performance, Skylar laid down the law on how wide her vocal range is, belting out the country-fried ballad. The judges' notes: Beautiful, amazing and HOT. Side note: No matter how she fares on "Idol," there must be a number of country-western labels salivating at the chance of signing Skylar. She is country youth personified.
Democracy will inevitably bring Islamist groups into Tunisia's political mainstream. A few conservative voices have already made rumblings about revising aspects of the Personal Status Code, whereas moderate Islamists are quick to express support for women's rights and adherence to the current code. Rachid Ghannouchi, head of the formerly banned Islamist party Nahda, was once critical of the Personal Status Code and the country's anti-polygamy laws on religious grounds, but by the late 1980s he had come to terms with it. He recently returned to Tunisia after exile in London and has again reaffirmed his support for women's rights. The question is whether Ghannouchi's brand of moderate Islamism will carry the day in Tunisia.

I find that the recent editorial in The Sun regarding Social Security falls far short of the reality of the situation ("Social Security sets off sparks," Sept. 14). Joe Biden said the same thing the editorial did on a CNN interview before the last Republican debate. It's easy. "A simple thing," he said. If it's so simple, then why hasn't anyone fixed it? Because it's not simple.

Still, Brown was not booked on suspicion of physically hurting the woman. Pickett said a criminal threats charge indicates a person makes a threat and has the capacity to carry it out.
Thrift stores are most likely to stock polka-dotted blouses, skirts and dresses, since these garments traditionally have been done in dots. Depending on store inventory, you may find pieces from the full-skirted '50s and the mod '60s as well as the occasional pair of polka-dotted palazzo pants from the late '80s. Pin-dotted blazers and slacks may turn up, too, but to capture the trend this time around, hold out for penny-sized dots or larger.

If Obama had a willing Congress, we might have a fighting chance. But politics and the looming election year block the nation's path to progress.
Rather, it's a fundraiser for the state GOP and a daylong political festival at Iowa State University. Presidential candidates make speeches and try to lure the most supporters to the event — with promises of food, live music and, sometimes, a lift to the site — in hopes of getting their backing in a nonbinding vote. The labor-intensive exercise gives candidates a chance to test their campaign operations and turn out supporters ahead of the winter caucuses.

Before I headed home, Tshering and I had a more typical tourist day in Thimphu. We visited the post office where I enjoyed having an official postal stamp made with an image of Tshering, Karma and me, found a gho and a kira to take home and made a trip to the Motithang Takin Reserve to check out the national animal of Bhutan, a large mammal that resembles a mash-up of a buffalo, antelope and goat. I thought I had abundant memories and packages to take home, but there was one more.

As the world shrinks, one is increasingly grateful for glimpses of cultures, farflung in time or place, that stir up one's inner Tintin or Conan Doyle with a sense of irreducible mystery. The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) seems dedicated to bringing us just such glimpses—in the most scholarly way, of course, it being a branch of New York University. The Institute's whimsically old-world setting accentuates the feeling of discovery. You walk into a repurposed townhouse—externally discreet, internally grand—just off upper Fifth Avenue and find a wholly unimaginable experience, an encounter, say, with 3000 B.C. Nubia or with Danube Valley relics from 5000 B.C. (two shows from recent years). The current show, "Nomads and Networks: The Ancient Art and Culture of Kazakhstan," couldn't be more splendidly esoteric, focusing as it does on that most perennially opaque of the earth's remote regions, the vast steppe-lands of Eurasia.

The result: Pujols, in more of a protect than attack mode, has swung at too many pitches out of the strike zone, producing weak contact and more strikeouts.

The back story gradually widens to reveal Luke's past, though the revelations come as cheap plot solutions to explain why he speaks fluent Russian or has secret access to the mayor of New York (Chris Sarandon).
