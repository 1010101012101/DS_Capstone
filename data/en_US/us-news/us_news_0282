Many of the other photos are tiny and square in format, made with the Brownie cameras that were just coming into popularity. Some of the details are emblematic of life in the disaster zone -- the outdoor kitchens and the tent cities, a wood-and-canvas barbershop, the two men posing proudly with their undamaged safe sitting in a pile of rubble, even a sign on a ruined building from a lawyer announcing that he had moved his offices to Haight Street during the current unpleasantness.

One of the set’s three CDs includes the digitally remastered “Darkness” album, with songs such as “Badlands,” “The Promised Land” and “Prove It All Night” — all staples of Springsteen’s concerts since ’78. The other two offer songs that didn’t make the cut. Among the outtakes are stellar songs that ended up being recorded by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes (“Talk to Me”), the Pointer Sisters (“Fire”) and Patti Smith (“Because the Night,” co-written with her); Springsteen’s “Talk to Me” in particular is a marvel, with a swirling, pulse-quickening rhythm arrangement and one of his most urgent vocals, ever.
As a community activist, historic preservationist and champion of the downtown scene, I'm offended that Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blakewants to hand $46,500 to Annapolis consulting contractor Westholm & Associates to study the market value of these buildings.

Southern states carry out more than 80 percent of the executions but have a higher murder rate than any other region. Texas has by far the most executions, but its homicide rate is twice that of Wisconsin, the first state to abolish the death penalty. Look at similar adjacent states: There are more capital crimes in South Dakota, Connecticut and Virginia (with death sentences) than neighboring North Dakota, Massachusetts and West Virginia (without death penalties). Furthermore, there has never been any evidence that the death penalty reduces capital crimes or that crimes increased when executions stopped. Tragic mistakes are prevalent.

In the case of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which recently became the first UNESCO World Heritage Site to be designated in the United States in the last 15 years, that would suit the vast majority of the inhabitants: thousands of threatened and endangered sea birds, monk seals, sharks, reef fish, delicate corals and endemic plants.

I could barely start speaking.
I was at the dining room table one evening and I remember my father was very upset about selling tickets to some dance he was hosting. It was very close to the date of the dance and he said they had only sold 800 tickets. I was scared because they seemed so nervous and concerned. I remember wondering, why would anyone pay money to dance around a room with other people?

They won all 21 of their matches entering state and won their first-round match in Springfield over Josh Papes and Carlton Poindexter of McCluer North, 7-5, 6-4. They more than met their match in the quarterfinals, though, winning just one game against Lyons and Goodman of Lafayette.

Being angry with mom is one of the great dramas of early childhood. It's so dangerous to push her away and leave one's tiny self exposed! The bunny child in "Mad at Mommy" by Komako Sakai (Scholastic: $16.99, ages 3-6) performs the brave feat of running away, only to return and throw himself into his mother's arms. The genius in this book is the bunny's expression: his refusal to look at his mother, his crushing disappointment at her failings, his towering rage as he promises to get bigger and "do whatever I want!" Any parent will recognize his gripes as legitimate ("You always tell me to hurry up…but then you never hurry up yourself"). No lovers' reconciliation ("Did you miss me?") could be as sweet.

To assemble the rolls, place a sheet of nori on a flat surface, and scoop a teaspoon of cooled quinoa and spread on the sheet. Roll the nori up like a jelly roll that is 1/2 inch in diameter. Seal the final edge, if necessary with a dab of extra mayo. If you're ambitious, tie each roll in the middle with a blanched chive strand. (Alternatively, you can present the quinoa and nori sheets side by side and let guests roll their own.)

“I think it’s really easy to write off the Chili Peppers as being a goofy band,” he says. “If you ask people what their first image of the Chili Peppers is, it might involve them standing onstage wearing socks and nothing else.

A federal magistrate judge in St. Paul ruled Monday that bank records filed in connection with a lawsuit over a suspicious currency investment program must be filed largely in public, an order that could help investors find their missing money.
The files are bound to figure prominently in the evidence prosecutors present at trial. But quite aside from their impact on Mr. Leopold's case, the fact that officers of the Anne Arundel County police had a hand in gathering and maintaining the dossiers raises serious questions about whether they violated a 2009 state law that restricts police from investigating activities by citizens that are protected by the First Amendment, unless they are part of a criminal probe. That legislation was passed in response to a 2005 Maryland State Police spying operation that targeted dozens of anti-war, animal rights and consumer groups across the state.
Quarterback Sam Bradford, selected first overall by St. Louis in 2010, received the last mega-rookie contract, a six-year, $78 million deal with $50 million in guarantees. But that was prior to last year's new labor agreement, which limits rookie contracts.

Shaw and the rest of the coaching staff know that they cannot replace Luck, who finished his career as Stanford's all-time leader in touchdown passes (82), completion percentage (.687), passing efficiency (162.76) and total offense (10,387 yards). Achieving numbers anywhere near as good as Luck's would be nearly impossible and unfair to expect.

Investigators have been intently focused on the stepmom after they learned she had tried to hire a landscaper late last year to kill her husband, about six to seven months before Kyron disappeared.

Vieira's choreography is deeply rooted in capoeira, the Brazilian martial art that was created by slaves during the 1600s as a way to defend themselves against oppression. The intense movement was disguised as dance as a way to fool slave owners, and since has evolved into a key element of Brazilian cultural identity. The intent of "Ritmos" is to pay homage to the African rhythms that are the foundations of samba and bossa nova music, and there are hints in the movement of the dark oppression experienced by slaves. But much of the movement is an emotionless tangle of arms and legs, with just enough mistakes to make you wonder how many times dancers take a hit in the face while learning their routines.
The Postal Service, an independent government agency, says it wants to deal with declining volume and $12 billion in debt by closing up to 252 mail-processing centers, shutting down 3,700 post offices and eliminating about 100,000 jobs. Otherwise, the agency says, it will lose about $14 billion by the end of the year and could run out of the cash it needs to handle day-to-day operations as early as this fall. The agency says the cuts it is seeking would save $6.5 billion a year.

There are things Germans simply do better than Americans or anyone else. People who enjoy making complex cuckoo clocks and high-tech screws are probably always going to be highly competitive in manufacturing exports. There's plenty we can learn from the Germans, Japanese, Chinese and everyone else. But they've learned a lot from us, too. Americans need to identify our comparative advantages -- social, cultural, political and economic -- and exploit them, instead of worrying about copying the competition.

Buffett also defended Berkshire's purchase last year of the Omaha World-Herald Co. He said even though he has highlighted the challenges newspapers face, the deal still made sense for Berkshire, which already owned the Buffalo News and a large stake in the Washington Post Co.

“I identify my mother with being happy, loving life, having a sense of joy in her friends,” said Gingrich when moderator Frank Luntz asked him to recall a moment with his mom. At the end of her life, said Gingrich, his mother lived in a long-term care facility, which helped him understand and get interested in brain science, a subject dear to his heart. He frequently tells voters here that he recently gave a lecture on brain science at the University of Iowa.

Like Di, Sisi was often reviled while alive; gloomy black rooms reflect her melancholia. "The 'lady in black' constantly sought to escape the burden of her own personality," one sign says. But when Luigi Luccheni drove a stiletto (on display, naturally) into her breast while she waited for a Geneva boat, he created a royal martyr and a souvenir industry, plus a role for actresses like Romy Schneider and Catherine Deneuve.

Today, three years after Ms. Strobel and Mr. Smith began downsizing, they live in Portland, Ore., in a spare, 400-square-foot studio with a nice-sized kitchen. Mr. Smith is completing a doctorate in physiology; Ms. Strobel happily works from home as a Web designer and freelance writer. She owns four plates, three pairs of shoes and two pots. With Mr. Smith in his final weeks of school, Ms. Strobel’s income of about $24,000 a year covers their bills. They are still car-free but have bikes. One other thing they no longer have: $30,000 of debt.

It's clear the NFL wants a franchise in Los Angeles, a market that has 5.6 million television households, second in the nation only to New York. The Twin Cities area is 15th at 1.7 million. The recent $2 billion price paid for the Los Angeles Dodgers was because of the team's big TV market, again showing just how important the area is to the NFL and its broadcast partners.

For Americans, the soaring food prices we've seen so far this year are an annoyance, not a calamity. But those who are barely hanging on to the lower rungs of the global economic ladder risk losing their grip entirely. This can contribute -- and it has -- to revolutions and upheaval.

Abortion and birth control: Supports abortion rights. Health care law requires contraceptives to be available for free for women enrolled in workplace health plans, including access to morning-after pill, which does not terminate a pregnancy but which some religious conservatives consider tantamount to an abortion pill. Supported requiring girls 16 and under to get a prescription for the morning-after pill, available without a prescription for older women.
Though the top rack rate at Badlands is just $140, it consistently ranks alongside much pricier courses. The three nines here live up to the Badlands name, so anyone shooting much over 100 might be in for a demoralizing afternoon (though four sets of tees can make the courses playable for even beginners).
The industry also faces some regulatory hurdles. The Chinese government closed its market to American pork after the H1N1, or swine flu, scare of 2009, opening it up only last year. Chinese officials closed the market for American beef in 2003 amid the mad cow scare, and it remains closed.
GREENWASHING: Disinformation to present an environmentally responsible public image that isn't warranted.
It took a while, though. Cameron drove a truck by day and wrote screenplays at night. Finally, in the early ’80s, he ended up at Roger Corman’s New World Pictures, where everyone learned by doing, and fast, churning out “the sleaziest of the sleaze.” The atmosphere: You were editing trailers yesterday? Great, now go write me a script about aliens. Just remember it has to have three topless scenes. Plus, we start shooting Monday.

Owner Mike Toole is on a first-name basis with regular customers, and there's no telling what gem might be hiding in the bins. The place specializes in vinyl, but the surprises aren't limited to vintage technology. I recently spotted a DVD of the Bob Dylan documentary "No Direction Home" for a deep discount.
In a series of agency reports over the years, Cambridge's ridership estimates have dropped sharply. The 2008 plan estimated an initial 500-mile system would carry 55 million passengers annually by 2030. In 2009, the number was adjusted to 41 million by 2035. In November, a draft plan put the number in a range as low as 29.6 million by 2040. And the business plan issued last week dropped the middle of the range to 26.4 million and said it could go as low as 20.1 million in 2040.

"Beadle was careful to maintain views of the gardens," she said. "It makes the home like a sanctuary."
Irving has played on the second nights of five back-to-backs this season, but never coming off these type of minutes. It will be interesting how he holds up against the world champions. The Cavaliers (8-13) did not have a shootaround today so the status of injured guards Anthony Parker (back) and Daniel Gibson (neck infection) is unclear. I doubt if either plays -- same for Tristan Thompson (ankle) -- but we'll know more around 6 p.m.
"Love Kills," directed by Scott Miller, is performed without an intermission, but you won't even notice because the story is engaging and moves along at a quick pace. It will leave you with plenty to talk about:
Lohse was pitching around him to face the pitcher with two runners on and two outs. He got Mike Leake to fly out to left field and end the threat. His second time through the order, Lohse has employed his breaking pitch for effect. Lohse got Jay Bruce to strikeout on a changeup to start the fourth inning, and two batters later he got ahead 0-2 on Drew Stubbs with back-to-back sliders. A fastball then froze Stubbs for a called strike 3 and Lohse's second strikeout of the game.
From 2008 to 2010, 15 children with prior abuse or neglect allegations died from subsequent abuse or neglect in Sacramento County. That compares with five such deaths in Fresno County and four in Alameda County.

It's unclear what this all means for Flynn. She says she's prepared to move out despite the victory, given the uncertainty of who actually owns title to her home and what must be done to foreclose legally.
The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla., which specializes in tornado forecasting, had warned of a "high-end, life-threatening event" nearly two days before the bad weather hit. It was just the second time in U.S. history that the center issued a high-risk warning more than 24 hours in advance. The first was in April 2006, when nearly 100 tornadoes tore across the southeastern U.S., killing a dozen people and damaging more than 1,000 homes in Tennessee.

Taking care of your child's teeth is a partnership between you, your family doctor or pediatrician, and your child's dentist. Therefore, you can help ensure that your child gets the best care. When your child sees the doctor for a visit, ask them to check for tooth decay. Also, if decay is discovered, make sure the physician refers you to the proper dentist or specialist. The American Academy of Pediatrics finds that 96 percent of primary care doctors take the time to refer parents of children with tooth decay to a dentist. But the study found that only half the time will your doctor take the time to schedule the appointment for you. You are an important part of the team to be sure your child gets the best care.

Cleveland's music director, who is also director of the Vienna State Opera, has meaty programs planned for both evenings. On Sunday night, the heavyweight in the lineup is most likely to be Shostakovich's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, written in 1939 when the iron grip of the Stalinist regime had its gloomiest hold over the composer. Often regarded as one of his more schizophrenic works, it opens with a long, mournful largo that is followed by two shorter "jokester" movements -- a biting, syncopated scherzo and a whirling finale with decidedly satirical overtones.

Houston's success against the Heat in 1999 had a lot to do with an aging Dan Majerle and an undersized Voshon Lenard being asked to guard him for long periods of time; and then-Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy was able to turn that into a big advantage for New York.

Belluscio also said anecdotal information suggests the number of bullying incidents reported in the state’s schools may be higher this year, under the new law, than last year, in part because the new law altered the definition of bullying. Under the old law, harassment, intimidation and bullying was defined as a series of incidents, while the new law indicates it can be a single incident or series of incidents.

The museum, contractors and Vinoly's office will determine who's responsible for the failure of the insulation after the repairs are made, Bapu said.
It doesn't really show in the box score, but the player who helped turn this game around was Brandon Mobley. After Patrik Auda was called for his second foul in the first five minutes, Kevin Willard had to turn to Mobley as his presence down low. Mobley — as one Seton Hall assistant said to us afterward — "Played his (butt) off." Mobley played 33 minutes, scoring 16 points and grabbing seven rebounds. He was able to fit right into the seams in the Providence defense which play right into the hands of a big man who can knock down a short jumper. Plus, having Mobley playing so well allowed for some of the pressure to come off of Herb Pope, allowing Pope the ability to open his game up in the second half. (He had 14 points after halftime.) The freshman forward, who missed much of the beginning of the season, said he's finally starting to feel comfortable on offense. That'd would be a big — and dangerous — weapon for Seton Hall.
In April, delicate spring leaves erupted, itching to burst into green. By May, the full rich head stood ready for the summer heat, but was outmatched by a June storm that took out a limb and scrambled its near-perfect silhouette.

 During 2011, Alexander's office charged at least a dozen of his former defense clients, court records show. To prevent conflicts of interest, DAs generally have the state attorney general's office pick up such cases. Bar spokesman William Chiang said he could not recall any recent DA who violated that precept, which can lead to disbarment. Alexander said he never knowingly prosecuted a former client, and that if such cases occurred they would have been due to record-keeping errors.

Film directors who fall too much in love with a play risk getting caught in such a limbo, yet passion is a necessary prerequisite for anyone seeking to transform a work from stage to the screen. Striking the right balance between freedom and fidelity can be elusive. There are many ways to get it right, as Elia Kazan's "A Streetcar Named Desire," Orson Welles' "Chimes at Midnight," Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" and Mike Figgis' underrated "Miss Julie" reveal with their varying degrees of latitude from their source material. And just as many ways to get it wrong, as exemplified in recent years by "Doubt," "The History Boys" and the musical "Nine," all of which fell woefully short of the old theatrical magic.
The late Thurgood Marshall framed the issue for the U.S. Supreme Court in 1977:
But it gets missed because most people think in terms of west-to-east for their trips. That is, people from the Bay Area tend to think east to Tahoe and Yosemite. That gets Morro Bay overlooked.

Most important, perhaps, those already found to have ADHD before surgery subsequently behaved so much better in many cases that they no longer fit the criteria. The National Institutes of Health has begun a study, called the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Study, to understand the effect of surgically removing adenoids and tonsils on the health and behavior of 400 children.

A spokesman for the governor’s office said Doyne acknowledged the Supreme Court limited his inquiry by excluding consideration of the impact of the state’s unprecedented budget crisis, and noted that despite the fact New Jersey meets or exceeds all other states in spending for "at-risk" students, many of those students continue to fail to meet basic educational proficiency.

"Slumdog Millionaire" will open commercially later this fall, so I'll confine myself to only a few effusions now, with more to come. There's never been anything like this densely detailed phantasmagoria -- groundbreaking in substance, damned near earth-shaking in style. Mr. Boyle and his colleagues, including his Indian co-director, Loveleen Tandan, have pulled off a soaring, crowd-pleasing fantasy that's a tale of unswerving love, a searing depiction of poverty and injustice and a marvelous evocation of multinational media madness. When I spoke to the director after the first screening here -- actually the first public screening anywhere -- I said his film was a great example of what the late Carol Reed once advised: Find the right container, and you can fill it with whatever you wish. "Yes," Danny Boyle replied, "and I also try to follow David Lean's advice to declare your ambitions in the first five minutes." The ambitions declared at the beginning of "Slumdog Millionaire" are huge. By the end they're completely fulfilled.

Like the dance itself, the women know how to get attention. Andrea Salamanca nudges Mario Espinoza, rubbing up against him, prodding him - and resorting to a slap, when necessary. The central duet for Jamal Callender and Kimberly Van Woesik is equal parts desire and confrontation, with Van Woesik goading Callender and launching herself at him, then clinging tight as he swings her around. Women are clearly the leaders here. Even when they aren't on stage, their presence is felt.

Ireland plunged into a financial morass after its six banks spent a decade gorging themselves on real estate loans that started going sour in 2008.
