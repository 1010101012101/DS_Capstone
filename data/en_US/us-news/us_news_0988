I am concerned about the information being passed by the Save Gladstone group. The group's latest flier overstated the cost of the Gladstone library by $5.6 million. They also mistakenly claim that 80 percent of the urban renewal fund will be depleted by the library project, when in fact the worst case is 27 percent. Most concerning of all is the list of numerous other projects and the implication that the city could use library funds for them. The truth is that the funds earmarked for the library cannot be used for those projects.

Not-So-Phab: This great comment came from a reader responding to last week's item about the impending emergence of tablets that double as phones: "It's bad enough that I have to constantly endure complete strangers' never-ending bellows and blather on their cell phones about the most intimate details of their personal lives or all-important business transactions, but I think I shall go completely unhinged if the guy beside me on the crowded 38-Geary bus whips out his 'phablet' and commences his conversation via speaker-phone.

lyrics. It's everywhere, and I especially feel that because I spend so much time on campuses. Young women just have much better (bull) detectors than we ever had. It's also true that women get more activist and radical with age. Our pattern of activism is in general the reverse of men. Men tend to be rebellious in youth; they get more conservative with age because they gain power. Women are more conservative in youth and get more radicalized with age because we lose power.

Homemade "gourmet mac and cheese" with American, parmesan, blue, goat and cream cheeses (also available by itself as an entree, $9.99) is piled on a pizza crust, tossed with chunks of chicken and covered with more cheese. Of course (as my bathroom scale was sad to tell me the next day) it was devastatingly delicious. The lush pillowy-tender macaroni-and-cheese had a perfect foil in the sturdy but toothsome, crackly pizza crust, with the chicken a chewy contrast to all that richness.

Arthritis self-management programs encourage patients to set up a weekly action plan for exercise and weight loss, including a log to track progress and gradually set higher goals. Coping with depression, a relatively common occurrence in people with restricted mobility, also is part of the lesson plan as is judicious use of pain drugs. The CDC says self-management education has been shown to help the health of an adult with doctor-diagnosed arthritis by 15% to 30% compared to medication alone.

I explained to the young man that if Robert Menendez Jr. feels comfortable talking to me, he should have no fear. Come to think of it, I haven't heard from Bob Jr. in quite awhile.

Republicans put on their patriot hats and said that by using the word “war” in this context, Democrats were demeaning America’s heroic men and women in uniform who are engaged in a real war. Then, when a Democratic campaign consultant took a cheap shot at Mitt’s wife, Ann, by saying the mother of five children had never worked a day in her life, Republicans took umbrage, blasting Democrats for waging — yes — a “war” on women.

It also would provide additional rest for rookie Felix Doubront and converted reliever Daniel Bard.

The servers are all terrific, engaged and very present. The crowd tends to very local, i.e., suburban Newport Beach, so it has a completely different vibe than the Highland Avenue restaurant. There are more big tables, fewer couples. It's not dark enough to be romantic. The bar seating isn't as intimate either, and doesn't seem particularly inviting. At the L.A. restaurant, a seat at the bar is coveted.

• MSNBC commentator Michael Smerconish: I think that he is playing loose with his language and saying what they did is what I was supportive of but that's just not accurate. That's half the story at best because the bailout component which was necessary because of a lack of other funding opportunities was something that he opposed. He can't say this is what I was for.

"Honestly, I kind of noticed a trend from last year," Hess ssaid. "Me and Nate (Nearhood) did most of the scoring last year, and we were not as successful down the stretch.

“Let me tell why this is important to me,” said Tavenner, who actually started his coaching career at Spalding. “I was the head coach at Bowling Brook from 1994-2000. We won the B division in 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2000. We did that with court-involved kids with no wrestling experience. They worked very hard to achieve that goal. I was so proud of those guys and the guys from the other teams I coached at the Brook. But that first championship was a special one for me.

For a guy his size, he also moves really well and creates separation.”

Hours later, a Superior Court judge refused the city’s legal challenge to end a 10-day stay of the layoffs. Had the judge ruled differently, Mayor Cory Booker’s plan to lay off 167 officers would have taken effect immediately.

That's just one of the questions the Bears will not answer today, tomorrow or at the end of the season. And that leads to an even bigger question: Will they even acknowledge they have a problem?

Statistics like these, combined with international inaction to protect these animals, have led several countries that rely on ocean ecosystems to declare their national waters shark sanctuaries by banning fishing for them. The small Pacific island nation of Palau was the first, creating a refuge the size of France in 2009. Palau was followed by the Indian Ocean island state of the Maldives, and in June of this year, by Honduras. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and most recently the Bahamas have also taken protective action. But if we are to truly save these ecologically significant animals, larger coordinated action on a global scale will be needed.

Part of the inspiration for the fake was to keep from kicking to Devin Hester, a threat to score on every return, but as Davis astutely observed, if the Jets were going to punt, why have Holmes lined up as a gunner and Sanchez as a personal protector for punter Steve Weatherford?

øA: The industry has made mistakes, and those get highlighted. But over time, the industry has a very good track record of delivering affordable energy. If we don't have affordable energy, it's not going to create the growth that we need in our economy, and it will cause higher costs, whether it's utility bills or at the pump for gasoline. If those costs rise, it's ultimately going to hit consumers and businesses and make it tougher to create jobs.

In interviews and flashbacks, both young women are philosophical about their customers, most of whom are married, middle-age and matter-of-factly perverse.

The evening's only lowest point, unfortunately, comes early, when diners are just getting to know Wit & Wisdom. The chilled shellfish platter, a signature Mina Group appetizer, makes a bad first impression. Consisting of only a half-dozen oysters and one cracked lobster tail, the "platter" is presented, inelegantly, in a single soup bowl, and what should be a grand opening flourish lands like a lead balloon. If only they served the maple custard from the dessert menu as an appetizer instead. Laced with orange toffee, Marcona almonds and bourbon, it's the highlight of Wit & Wisdom's smart and seasonal dessert menu.

The committee on Infractions hammered the Union school for “major violations” of NCAA legislation today, and has placed all 13 of the university’s athletic teams on probation until April 18, 2016, while handing the women’s basketball team a postseason ban for the 2012-13 season.
If the president is living like Donald Trump on our dime, why shouldn't the folks in his administration do the same? Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta cost taxpayers $860,000 for his frequent trips to his California home. Panetta is required to travel by military jets for security purposes, and he has reimbursed $17,000 to the government as required. But while Panetta (whose estimated personal worth is $225 million) is slashing spending on our troops, how does he justify these too-frequent trips home?

After speaking with Reese, he assured me that there was no problem with any of the "three officers involved". He went on to add that he and the "Chiefs Office" were constantly monitoring the "oil levels of all three involved officers", and that there was no need for concern on my part. I told Commander Reese directly that if the "Oil levels" were in fact fine, I would not have been sitting in his office. Before leaving, he asked for the call information I spoke to him about involving Sergeant Nice, and I provided it to him. My last thought to Commander Reese as I was leaving his office, was that even the most minor of incident involving these officers, had the potential for becoming a major media circus. As most officers are aware, it is not what an officer does, but who the officer is who does it that matters.

øThis free website explores environmental issues as seen through the eyes of teen cousins Izz and Dex. The clever cartoon characters star in 15 animated episodes where they explore issues that most tweens and teens can relate to. For example, in one called "Pigs Fly," Izz and Dex look at how their breakfast food got to them. Noting that the bacon had been flown in (and thus that "Pigs Fly"), the teens examine how this process uses a lot of gasoline. Kids discover that eating local can also cut down on the need for preservatives and will support local businesses. The brainchild of WGBH Interactive, this site also has games, a blog, downloads and special features like a Carbon Calculator and advice about cancelling unwanted catalogs.

My son is a week removed from his 5th birthday - he'll tell you all about the big milestone - and baseball, as you'd imagine, has always been a part of his life. I took him to old Yankee Stadium for a game so he could say he went where Babe Ruth and other giants played. If I'm not at home, he calls and asks, "What ballpark are you at today?" He's learning to keep score, and when he goes up to hit at T-Ball he settles into a wide-base stance. He bends his knees, goes into a semi-squat, and holds his bat straight up like an antennae popping from just behind his back shoulder. You can guess where he picked that up. He has lots of favorite teams and a rotating cast of favorite players.

Agriculture has become a tourist draw in Hawaii, which imports about 85 percent of its food but used to export almost everything it grew - tons of pineapples and sugar cane. In just one week on the islands, I slept on a farm, toured a coffee plantation, learned how chocolate is grown and much more. Yes, the beaches are a draw - snorkeling at Two-Step on the Big Island was unforgettable. And sure, some people still want to see hula and go to a luau.

Apparently, controversy is the watchword for some children's picture books this season. At least that's the case for one book that has sparked quite a discussion in media outlets, including the decidedly un-bookish Fox News. In Barack Obama's "Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters" (Alfred A. Knopf: $17.99, ages 3 and up), the president of the United States appears to endorse some historical figures — including Cesar Chavez, Georgia O'Keeffe and Maya Lin — over others as models for children. Isn't it great to know that the leader of the free world thinks enough of children to write seriously for them — seriously enough to be controversial? (Although, in fairness, with the state of our politics, any move he makes will be objectionable to someone.)
New operator for national park lodge at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park: In late March, a new operator for Volcano House, the "lodge" on the rim of the Kilauea volcano, was selected. Volcano House had become worn down and unattractive by the time the park and its longtime concessionaire parted ways in 2009. The building has been closed for nearly three years as the National Park Service tried to negotiate a new contract. Meanwhile, the Park Service spent $4 million in exterior and seismic upgrades. After an unsatisfactory first round of bids in 2010, the revised bidding resulted in the selection of Hawaii Volcanoes Lodge Co., which received a 15-year deal to operate the hotel, restaurant and other concessions. It's a partnership between Hawaii's Aqua Hotels and Resorts and Ortega National Parks, a company that operates facilities at several Park Service sites, including Death Valley and Carlsbad Caverns. The new operator promises up to $3.5million in improvements and to return a 6 percent profit to the Park Service. No firm date for reopening the lodge has been announced. Meanwhile, portions of the Circle Road around the park remain closed due to high levels of sulfur dioxide from the volcano. The emissions create the volcano fog, or "vog," that can bring hazy conditions to the Kona Coast and sometimes to neighboring Maui.
