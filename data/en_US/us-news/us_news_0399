He was staying at the Hilton, where Obama eventually would stay, said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

One league executive said he's witnessed improved play in the past two weeks as teams are starting to find their rhythms. The good news is the television ratings are strong and fans appear willing to overlook some errant passes and missed jumpers. But as the Super Bowl ends and the casual fan prepares to return, you hope that so many games played in so littlecalendar space don't turn the NBA postseason into an endless series of 81-76 games.

"There have been teams in MLS where you've had general managers coming into post-game speeches and shouting over the coach. You just can't have that," Paulson said. "He needs to give the coach his space and have a great working relationship with the coach. He can't be looking over the coach's shoulder all the time. That would be a recipe for disaster."

But it isn't only the psychedelic patterns that call attention to these styles: It's also their matchy-matchiness—something that now actually seems daring. For the past 10 years, high fashion has sneered at matching tops and bottoms. Matched suits, particularly on women, hinted at a lack of modern attitude, a pre-dot-com stodginess. To avoid them, women replaced blazers with belted cardigans and tossed herringbone jackets over their gray-flannel slacks.
A: Plants whose blooms smell as foul as this one should probably be illegal, said UC master gardener Bill Pierce. What the birds or the wind has brought you is Dracunculus vulgar, the dragon arum or voodoo lily.

There was that 4-foot putt on the 17th hole in regulation that he hit firm to eliminate the break, knowing that if he had missed the ball likely would have rolled off the green. On some of the toughest greens in golf, Nicklaus only had one three-putt all week. The olive pants — his wife called them his "Army pants" — that he liked so much he wore them again in the playoff. And the 18th hole in the playoff, when Palmer picked up Nicklaus' ball, only for USGA executive director Joe Dey to run onto the green and remind them it was stroke play and Nicklaus had to finish the hole.

Mercy Corps' donor policy is the only strike against it in an otherwise excellent review on Charity Navigator. But renting and swapping mailing lists generates 15,000 to 20,000 new donors a year, Hambuchen said. Donors can always ask for fewer mailings or opt out altogether, she said.
Berj Parseghian brings a varied background as an environmental lawyer who has represented both plaintiffs and defendants, but although he is an experienced lawyer, and by most accounts a good one, he would be little more than a novice in a courtroom. He has logged some hours as a volunteer judge presiding over traffic cases, and it's a start, but he's not ready. Ben Brees has a lot of the life experience that it's good to see in judges, having been a truck driver and a bus driver, having run small businesses and having held down a nuts-and-bolts law practice. But there is nothing in his background or presentation that indicates he is fit to run a courtroom.

Slim space: The area for the new kitchen was long and narrow: 11.5-by-25 feet. "The width was tricky," Hansen said. "It was a challenge to fit everything in so it felt like a big space when it wasn't." To make the most of the square footage, Hansen designed a long, narrow center island, and cabinets that are long but not deep -- only 12 inches. "It's a perfect pantry because you don't pile up things in the back," said Julie. Other built-ins, including a window seat, bookshelves and cubbies, help cut down on clutter and hide unsightly features, such as a clothes chute and ductwork.

Q: There seemed to be no, I don't want to say let down or drop off, I mean you guys have played back to back overtime games. You played a double overtime game to clinch the series and you didn't have much turnover on time, but there seemed to be no drop off in terms of energy or that. Is that just that natural momentum or adrenaline that just takes over at that point?

After a 90-minute run on a treadmill, a power nap and a shower, Chip and I headed downstairs to a late dinner at Okada, a modern Japanese restaurant with a private garden and floating pagoda table.

But as it turns out, Zimmerman had in fact raised more than $200,000 from supporters on a website and PayPal account he established. That new development, divulged by Zimmerman's attorney at a hearing Friday, could prompt Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. to increase the $150,000 bond he set earlier -- though the judge said that he wanted to know more about who controls the money before ruling on the matter.
But next month, the school is expected to close. The state Department of Education this spring denied a renewal of Emily Fisher’s charter, due in large part to low test scores, citing a "culture of low expectations" and "little evidence of learning taking place." If the school closes, students will "transition" back to regular Trenton schools.

Get steamy: While sudden spikes in the amount of sulfur dioxide and smoke can cause rangers to close the park for safety reasons, in smaller doses they can provide some of the most intriguing sights (and smells) of the volcanic region, beyond the flashier flowing lava. At the park's Steam Vents and Steaming Bluff areas, groundwater seeps onto broiling rocks and turns into billowing steam, close to another photo-worthy perspective of the Halema'uma'u plume and less than a mile from the Kilauea Visitor Center.

These Irish rockers have made a career of playing to the back rows with the same blend of bombast and intimacy that has done wonders for U2 and Coldplay, although it should be noted that their singer, Gary Lightbody, tends to come across more as the kind of guy you might enjoy a pint with at the local pub. U.S. hits include the Top 5 "Chasing Cars" and Modern Rock hits "Run" and "You're All I Have."
The announcement comes a week after the FDA seized 11 shipments of imported orange juice that had levels of carbendazim higher than 10 parts per billion – a violation of U.S. law, though the EPA says the amounts aren't harmful to consumers.

2009 Winderlea Dundee Hills Vineyards Dundee Hills Pinot Noir ($38, 14.5%): Bill Sweat and Donna Morris acquired the esteemed Goldschmidt vineyard, and renamed it.

"Everybody be at the pep rally after school -- senior Tim Tebow is leading Denver Broncos High School to state! Yeah! Denver is, improbably, the NFL's hottest team outside Wisconsin, 5-1 since Tebow took the reins. Those fans in the bleachers who'd been chanting for Tebow -- they were right. But then in high school, the booster club always knows. Maybe for the next home game, the Broncos should run out through a big sheet of paper that was decorated at the pep rally with ‘Go Broncos' and ‘XXOO' written all over by the cheerleaders."
Only the first few seconds of the fight were shown last night. Magro had angrily confronted Sorrentino after his epically on-again, off-again girlfriend Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola revealed to Magro that Sorrentino had told her that earlier in the trip, Magro had planned to bring home several girls after a night of clubbing.

Osteoarthritis, which can affect knees, hips, feet, hands and other parts of the body, occurs when the cartilage that cushions the spaces between the joints wears away. The disease affects some 27 million Americans and leads to 632,000 surgical joint replacements a year. It is the most common cause of disability for U.S. adults, according to the nonprofit Arthritis Foundation. That number is expected to grow as the population ages: One in two adults will develop knee osteoarthritis before age 85, and the risk increases to two in three adults who are obese.

"It's difficult to think of Dana Delany or Tom Selleck as someone who has been around for 25 or 30 years, but this current group of stalwart stars certainly is comparable to those stars who were beloved veterans when Delany and Selleck were getting started," said TV historian David Bianculli, a Rowan University professor who operates the website tvworthwatching.com.

In April, Mr. Hazare launched a five-day fast that forced the government to agree to draft a bill creating a Lokpal with input from Team Anna members as well as cabinet ministers. But the effort dissolved in disputes: Chiefly, Mr. Hazare's team wanted the agency to have powers to prosecute sitting prime ministers and the judiciary and wanted civil society to have a strong say in who would run it.

Prime Minister Singh on Monday signaled that the government was prepared to be flexible, saying in a speech, "We are open to reasoned debate on all these issues."

It makes me very sad."

That was supposed to be a glimpse of what Santana would be as a Met; instead, what’s followed have been three lost years for the franchise and a ceaseless supply of uncertainty for Santana.

But Comfort of Strangers actually stands as testimony enough to Orton's radical/retro shift toward sonic simplification. Early in her career, in collaboration with Orbit, she covered John Martyn's "Don't Wanna Know 'bout Evil," and on her pivotal 1997 Best Bit EP she sang a duet with Terry Callier on Fred Neil's classic "Dolphins." ("I'm singing the Tim Buckley version and Terry is singing the Fred Neil version," she wrote in the track notes for Pass in Time.) Now 35, Orton seems to have grown into a place that may not completely overlap but at least butts right up to the musical territory of those pioneers. And it's the slightly jazz folk-rock of Martyn, Neil and Buckley, even more than the oft-referenced chamber-folk of Nick Drake, that informs the sound of Comfort of Strangers.

The Wegmans prepared food department is very café-like, with an attendant to clear and clean tables, and a choice of eating downstairs or upstairs. Upstairs is more fun - you can look down at all the action in the store. There are Chinese, Thai and Indian dishes on buffets, a huge salad bar and a sushi bar with three chefs who like the unusual, plus a small, separate kosher counter. A brick oven constantly pops out warm, fragrant artisan breads. Add a hunk of cheese from the cheese department and maybe a pear from produce, and voilá -- you're in Tuscany. Almost.

In St. Louis, she and her daughter ate lunch at the oldest Italian restaurant on the Hill, the city’s historic Italian-American neighborhood. There she discovered the “parmiciano” sandwich, where instead of a traditional cutlet, the veal had been chopped, formed into a patty, breaded and fried. Veal was expensive, she reasons, so immigrants must have opted for cheaper, tougher cuts and found a way to make them work. It was a reasonable — and delicious — facsimile of the real thing.

Mike Vaccaro, New York Post: "Do you remember when the Jets were going to rise to the top of the NFL on the shoulders of their defense, when they were going to reduce proud offenses to dust with their toughness and their savvy and their execution? Do you remember the defense Rex Ryan promised when he was hired, the one he installed when he arrived, the one he praised and over-praised all the way to Indianapolis last year? It's good to remember that defense. Because memories are all that remain. Because the Patriots exposed this version of the Jets' D as a collection of chatty pretenders, delivering a 45-3 bloodletting that could be heard all around the other 30 snickering precincts of the league. Everyone loves to see braggarts taken down a peg."

“Bon Iver” is not the first Bon Iver album. “For Emma, Forever Ago,” an introspective set cut in a hunting cabin in Wisconsin, took listeners by surprise in 2008. Initially self-released, “For Emma” received breathlessly positive reviews and made Vernon an instant folk-pop favorite. Along with similar albums by Iron and Wine and Fleet Foxes, “For Emma” set the template for the modern sensitive male singer-songwriter: meditative and in passionate love with echo, rustic, but not shy about using electronics. Kanye West is a fan – he sampled Bon Iver’s “Woods,” and collaborated with Vernon on “Lost in the World,” a highlight of “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.”
