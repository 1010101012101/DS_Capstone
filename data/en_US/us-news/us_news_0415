But the next day, when I braved the Puerto Rican roads and kamikaze drivers in a rental car -- the only time I wondered if my mother's ever-present fears might have been right -- to drive 45 minutes east to the El Yunque rain forest, I understood why the frog was everywhere.
"First place was taken over by Mascoutah (6315 total pins) and the rest of the field was fighting it out for the second spot," Hay said. "Going into the last game, there were three teams within 50 pins of each other for second place. It was a dog fight."

While Kasich said Colbert's hire wasn't based on race, he did sound chastened by the tub-thumping rebukes he's endured in recent weeks as the prospect of the first all-white Ohio governor's cabinet since 1962 ignited controversy. Along with failing to include any minorities in his Cabinet, Kasich had angered black lawmakers by likening diversity to quotas.
Enid's QuirkOut moment is to buy the worst possible candy to hand out, so she's not tempted to sample. We're talking puffy orange circus peanuts, mint leaves and stale candy corn.

Prices are still strong for our local heroes, for the reason that it's very capital-intensive to build a winery with vineyards from scratch. I believe that over time the prices will balance out and come into line with the rest of the market. Although the wineries mentioned here are getting a lot of buzz these days, keep in mind there are several good producers in the state that are not mentioned in this article.
in 1873, Coors' Golden operation is today the largest single-site brewery in the world. Visitors can enjoy a free, 30-minute, self-guided tour of some of the site's highlights, accompanied by an audio device that details the malting, brewing and packaging processes. Once the walking is done, thirsty travelers can cool off in the "fresh beer room," and sip a cold sample while resting on ice-cube benches in a refrigerated room.

The Kubang will have the same underbody as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. It also will be renamed, but a new name was not announced.
A few of the mayor’s stalwart supporters, including his brother, Raphiel Mack, showed up with signs announcing their approval of the mayor. One of those supporters, however, took it a step too far in launching an expletive-laced confrontation. That man, who is black, was videotaped with his shirt pulled over his head to hide his identity. He lambasted community activist Kevin Moriarty — who is white and has since filed a complaint with the Trenton Police Department — with obscenities and an extended middle finger, baiting him as “whitey.”

I didn't have a ticket or even a city map when I arrived in Amsterdam by train. It didn't matter because the busy Central Station tourist office issued me a 24-hour transit pass, museum entrance and hotel booking at the Residence le Coin, a modest hotel on New Doelen Street owned by the nearby University of Amsterdam. From the train station I caught a tram that jolted past houseboats on placid canals and planters full of tulips, reminding me how hard it is not to like Amsterdam.

Cherry-blossom season usually brings out nostalgia, moments of reflection and the occasional haiku. A fast-paced society known for its reserve pauses for a collective fragrant breath and dances of joy.

A small number of states and districts already use value-added scores to determine which teachers should be rewarded and which need help. This summer, one district took a harder line: Washington, D.C., schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee fired 26 teachers based in significant part on their poor value-added scores.
He was joined in Sudan by several hundred "Arab Afghans," veterans of the anti-Soviet jihad, and training camps were set up.
School takes on a different meaning here. Amish children attend a one- or two-room schoolhouse through eighth grade and usually receive no education after that. (In the 1950s, a group of Amish parents went to prison for refusing to send their children to public schools. Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Amish children could end their formal education at 14.)

Kline said he secured commitments Friday from the offices of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., to fast-track the legislation in the House next week. A schedule posted by Cantor's office Friday lists a potential vote on Tuesday.

In another attempt to free up cash for lending, China on Wednesday reduced the amount of money its banks are required to hold in reserve. It was the first easing of monetary policy in three years, and analysts are expecting more.
 The gazpacho was more like salsa and was overwhelmed by the sharp note of raw onion. Our server asked if I wanted the always-entertaining fresh ground pepper show. Turns out it needed salt.

A similar performance tonight would send the Ducks on their way to a Pac-12 title and a trip to the Rose Bowl. A more stationary Thomas could give Stanford's defense the edge it needs to at least somewhat control Oregon's offense enough to set the stage for a close fourth quarter it is well equipped to win.
Verizon Wireless got rid of unlimited plans for new smartphone subscribers last summer. Customers grandfathered into such plans can see their speeds throttled back if they are among the top 5% of users in areas where cell sites are congested, a spokeswoman said. She declined to say if the carrier had any plans to change its policy. Sprint doesn't impose any limitations on throughput for its unlimited customers.
Keller was inside, already dead of a self-inflicted gunshot. A handgun was next to his body.
The Greek parliament must pass a new $40 billion austerity package this week so the European Union and the International Monetary Fund release the next installment of Greece's $156 billion bailout loan. Otherwise, the country could become the first in the euro zone to default on its debts -- a potentially disastrous event that could drag down European banks and affect other financially troubled European countries.

Maybe they can't see the effects of an auto factory or textile factory shutting down. Maybe they can't fathom the devastation that happens when a company relocates an entire electronics assembly line to another country. Maybe they don't understand that for all the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost, those are communities devastated, workers who can't provide for their families, an entire segment of the population struggling to maintain the economic gains they've made.
Dewan assigned Berkman a minus-9 in right field in 2007, his last year at the position.
The Sudols paid out-of-pocket for their repairs.
Klatt said as much last Saturday during the Huskies' game against Arizona, when he pronounced Polk the best running back in the conference. That statement sparked a rash of comments online from fans, some of who wondered if Polk would be good in the Ducks' offense, and if James' stats were merely a result of a prolific offense. And which one of them has a brighter future, anyway?
The Flyers put a slow start well behind them in the third and completely set the pace. They used a tremendous forecheck to stave off the Devils and played with more life in their skates than a worn-down Devils team that had only a three-day break.
The Denver-based WAC is adding three schools in basketball for next season — the University of Denver, Seattle and Texas-Arlington.
Without warning and for no apparent reason, nearly a thousand centrifuges began speeding up and slowing down, in ways that seemed calculated specifically to destroy them. At the same time, the systems monitoring those centrifuges did not register a single problem. Those centrifuges were destroyed, according to reports, and Iran's nuclear program was set back months  maybe years.
The United States has not said precisely what constitutes a significant reduction in Iranian oil purchases — that is, the bar countries must meet to avoid penalties.

This year for the first time, the conference is a BYOD -- bring your own device -- event, where conference-goers trade past years' clunky informational binders for digital alternatives such as Sched, an interactive program that allows attendees to plan their own schedules via mobile device.

Meanwhile, talk emerged Friday of another possible site option that would make discussions about moving to TCF moot. Vikings vice president of stadium development Lester Bagley and Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission chairman Ted Mondale said they've been looking at acreage just southeast of the Dome, between 11th Avenue S. and Interstate 35W. Bagley said that the location would be ideal but that buildings on the site might be difficult to relocate.

At first, I would hold the kite's string and run excitedly across the field as quickly as I could.

When I decided to revisit his recipe, it was pouring rain over my grill outside and I did not have an adobe brick handy. But I did have herbs and spices, including dried espelette pepper (smoked paprika is also good) and a chicken the butcher had butterflied.
Byock followed the publication in 2004 with "Four Things That Matter Most," a counseling tool for palliative care and hospice programs. Now, he is making the rounds talking about his latest book "The Best Care Possible," which debuted in March. It tackles the crisis that surrounds serious illness and dying in America and his quest to transform care through the end of life.

According to Greeley, the striping and signage improvements at the Main Street intersection were the first order of business that the contractor addressed and were completed within approximately two weeks.
That said, alert your physician if the bruising increases. Normally, frequent bruising can signal more serious conditions, including leukemia and other blood disorders. But yours is probably a not-unexpected result of a treatment that's otherwise good for you.
"Folks who have been touched by a violent crime, including missing persons, either as victims or family members, should always persevere and never give up," said Valentino Zavala, Rodriguez's cousin and a Michigan police officer whose efforts contributed to the ID. "Esaw was somebody's child, brother, nephew, grandson and cousin and didn't deserve to be murdered - nobody does - and all of those lives are touched."
The dust-up put some life into a dull building with the Suns trailing 67-58 at the time. The Suns responded with consecutive 3-pointers by Steve Nash and Dudley and they were never out of striking distance again.
"Most people think a woman should go to school, then get married, take care of the babies and then die," Zuhair says.
“When you’re Johns Hopkins and you beat Virginia, everybody tells you you’re going to win the national championship. When you’re Johns Hopkins and you lose two games, everybody tells you you’re doing everything wrong,” he said. “I guess coaxing isn’t the right word. It was just more helping them to recognize that we weren’t as good as people said we were and we’re not as bad as people say we are when we lose two in a row. For us, it’s mental, and it was just to remind them that we’re the same team that won nine games. We ran up and down with the No. 1 team in the country, and make no mistake, they’re the real deal. They’re good. They know how they want to play, they know who they want to do things with, they were good at the X today. … But it was more helping our guys to just remember that we’re the same dopey son of a guns that found a way to win nine games. We can’t just be that lucky to win nine games on our schedule.”
And later, when reporting on the unrelated suicide of a circuit court judge, Krist writes: "For most Chicagoans, then, the judge's suicide was just one more mystery, one more ghastly and inexplicable tragedy to augment the already pervasive sense of chaos in the city. Something seemed fundamentally wrong …"
Murray, for his part, is also surprised to be not facing Nadal in the semifinals.
"It was good because the way they did it, I didn't have to sit out that long," the freshman point guard said earlier this week. "But it definitely pushed me back a bit, as far as stamina-wise — because you have to stay in the best shape. Especially in such a physical game. Stamina is the most important thing you need to have, it really is. So definitely not being able to work out that week, you take a couple of steps back."
The current displays include pottery by internationally known local artist Warren MacKenzie and ancient American Indian Mimbres pottery discovered by the university's archaeologists.
"I plan on going home and getting in my bed," Howard said when asked if the report was true. "That's what the plan is right now. I had a three-hour, 30-minute practice. I'm ready to go home, eat, play some Call of Duty and get in the bed. I don't plan on doing any talking to anybody except the people that are playing online with me."
On the table are striking, handblown, clear-glass water carafes, each a different shape, and amazing little amber glass votive holders that look like sections of cut firewood -- a sly nod, perhaps, to Portland's eco sensibility. Pale light shoots through a tapestry of fused glass separating the dining room from the temporary bar space that now serves the overflow of diners. A communal wenge wood table sits beneath four hanging white opaque glass cylinders issuing warm, sensual light. The rest of the space, flanked by rolling glass doors, is as raw as the building's roots, with railroad ties turned into wine racks, bare floors with cryptic yellow lines and numbers, and peeling paint everywhere.
Q: So, other than that it went well with the animals?
"We worked hard to get our school district the way it is right now, and I’m not hired to tear down the school district," DeFabiis said.

Sacramento officials began changing course on their arena effort Tuesday, even as resentment over the failure of the city's most recent plan continued to smolder.
Fortunately for travelers who pine for the old, unimproved Riviera Maya, tourism has come more slowly to the southern half of the Caribbean coast. The recently dubbed Costa Maya, tucked under the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve on a wide peninsula jutting out from the mainland, remained largely unnoticed by everyone except fly-fishermen. In fact, until Carnival Cruise Line and the government's tourism arm brought a huge cruise port to the tiny fishing village of Mahahual in 2001, there were no paved roads, power lines or telephone service.
The lead detective in the Tim Masters' murder investigation was indicted this morning on eight counts of felony first-degree perjury.
Lacy declined to discuss evidence in the case on Thursday. Ultimately, DNA evidence could prove a vital link or the key to eliminating him as suspect. Authorities took a DNA sample from him in Bangkok and will take another sample when he returns to the U.S., Thai police told The Associated Press.
"They took a look at our cats and said, 'Wow, I want to try that,'" Hatch says, recalling the early days of their raw cat food adventure nine years ago. "We decided that maybe we needed to share it with the world."
Local leaders may be hoping to persuade the Rams to waive the "top-tier" requirement. But no one expects the team's owner - sports mogul and developer Stan Kroenke - to do that for free.
But records reveal that wasn’t the first slaying attributed to an inmate who was released early.
In addition, authorities allege, Ronald Oshrin, 49, distributed the images over the internet and officials say they believe there are more victims.

In 2006, a Sherwood landowner cleared six acres of trees in advance of a city tree ordinance. And last year, a Tigard landowner wanted to clear-cut nearly 2,300 trees to avoid regulations that would be tied to future development.
According to Chicago State's written policy and interviews, students with a cumulative GPA of 1.99 or lower are placed on academic probation after one semester. They are supposed to be dismissed "for poor scholarship" if, after the next semester, they have below a 1.8 with less than 30 credit hours, 1.9 after 30 credit hours, or 2.0 after 60 credit hours.
This year's budget had been viewed as a rare chance for the government to introduce sweeping structural changes—such as reducing foreign-investment barriers, overhauling subsidy programs rather than simply promising cuts, and engaging in large-scale privatization of state-run firms.
"We need to spice this up!" he says, "Let's all agree to make the eighth notes short and decisive, more staccato."
ACORN's leader in Oregon says the help that the nonprofit agency gives lower-income residents trying to stay in their homes or fight bad landlords is getting overlooked in the national argument over the group's voter-registration and counseling efforts.

District 6 candidates so far include Bob Stacey, the former 1000 Friends of Oregon executive director who narrowly missed election as Metro Council president last year, and newcomer Jonathan P. Levine. He lists himself as a degree candidate at Portland State University, a research project manager, program manager and an English-as-a-second-language teacher.
This, of course, lands us exactly where the nation has been for years now — polarized Democrats and Republicans finding absolutely no common ground, and the possibility of real deficit reduction seemingly beyond the reach of a politically gridlocked Congress. The only bright spot: a gradually improving economy is going to slowly raise tax revenues and, if spending is constrained, help bring a bit more balance to the federal ledger without any major policy moves.
The Capitals could have folded. Instead, they staved off elimination, and the teams will meet in New York on Saturday night to determine who will face the New Jersey Devils in the conference finals. Washington hasn't been that far since 1998; the Rangers haven't since 1997.
Romney is counting on Christie, known for his blunt and charismatic style, to help him connect with Cleveland-area voters. Christie has remained solidly behind the former Massachusetts governor, even as Republican operatives uneasy with the unsettled GOP field have implored him to reconsider his decision not to seek the presidency this year.
At the Open Space Gallery, 2720 Sisson St., on April 28 and 29, from noon to 6 p.m., the third annual Publications and Multiples Fair will take place. It features lectures by David Senior and Ed Penar. A host of vendors will be selling small batch, handmade publications, including Chloe Maratta, Chris Day, Closed Caption Comics, Dylan Thadani, Friends Records, Gary Kachadourian, Jason Kachadourian, Important Comics, Noel Friebert and Suzanna Zak. Think of these things as analog apps that require no tablet or smart phone.
Jeff Goldman: The easiest is the hitter that hits the home run is up with two outs, hits a foul pop that is dropped for an error and then hits his home run after the dropped foul pop. Unearned run.
According to authorities, she told the women — who are all in their 20s and early 30s — that she had the procedure done or had seen someone do it, Sepulveda said, and said she had been doing it for awhile. Cruz-Dilworth has no medical training, which is required to perform the injections, he said.
Wiggins, at his hearing in El Paso, told the judge, "We are being set up. What if we didn't do it?" according to an Associated Press account of the proceeding. "They drive us from our home, they put chains on us for 30 days and nobody listens to us."
The growth came despite the increasing hardship on families to pay for higher education. Many more students have taken out large government loans to support their studies, while many recent graduates, struggling to land jobs in this tough economy, have wondered whether it was worth it all.
Officials with the state Department of Community Affairs say they have no objection to the budget, which Mack had insisted on Thursday still required their approval, causing city council to postpone action.
Still, Wilson does engage in speculative biography, reading between the lines of the "Commedia," the "La Vita Nuova" and the other works, striving to give us a portrait of a man who, long before he was a literary immortal, was like the rest of us: beleaguered by his job, by the turmoil of his times, struggling with debts, critics, jealousy.
Edwards appeared in person at Friday's hearing. His lawyers had made the motion for a delay under seal, but some of its details were publicly revealed by the judge in the open hearing.

April Ellebracht, another Save Kimber Park member, said the developer's studies and community outreach efforts have gone on long enough.
The Rangers are favored in most quarters because they have the hottest pitcher, Lee, and the hottest hitter. Josh Hamilton hit four home runs in the ALCS even though the Yankees walked him eight times. He might be the most dangerous offensive force the World Series has seen since Barry Bonds tore through the Angels staff in 2002.
Sveum said the Cubs were also stymied by Marcum, who gave up just one run and three hits in seven strong innings.

But if you go, know that the killer whale has migrated back to the mainland.
Brennan Boesch and Gerald Laird opened the inning with singles and scored on Dirks' double. After an out, Millwood walked Prince Fielder and Delmon Young made Seattle pay for pitching around Fielder with a line-drive double into the left-center field gap to score Dirks and Fielder, chugging around from first. Fielder later homered in the seventh.
Hes lost in the tournament before, but think about it: Theres no Lehigh or Bucknell or Richmond on his resume. Michigan State has lost to a lower seeded team only twice outside the Final Four. They lost in 2004 to Nevada in a 7-10 match-up. And they were upset victims to George Mason in 2006 when the Patriots went on their historic run to the Final Four (beating North Carolina and UConn in the process.) That right there puts Izzo into some rare air.

Hey, Dave: I'm not completely sold on Flynn, though I'd look into it. As for your trade, Green Bay is too smart to make that trade. Their offense is based on a top-of-the-game quarterback throwing to a fleet of good, young receivers. They are not going to be trading Nelson, an emerging star.
Donors wanting to give specifically to children are asked for single-serving foods, particularly pop-top tuna, 100 percent fruit rolls, raisins, graham crackers, unsweetened applesauce, cheese and crackers, fruit cups, low-sugar cereal bowls, pretzels and granola bars without peanuts.

The dangerous dithering was driven by ideological divisions that continue to paralyze the currency union's search for solutions to its structural flaws. Deep differences on economic policy between Europe's frugal north and laxer south, between Germany and France, and between national governments and central EU institutions hindered an effective early response to the crisis. Only when faced with calamity—the collapse of the euro zone—did leaders put aside their differences and reach a compromise.
Though the quake damage was minor — the largest was a 4.0 — environmental groups questioned whether the state's safety rules were strong enough to protect the area from disasters they attribute to hydraulic fracturing. The issue has also become more political in many areas as the United States has stepped up its drilling as part of a drive for more energy.
What is one of the most important issues facing your generation? The lack of interpersonal skills. I feel that because of social-media sites, my generation does not know how to function without a digital interface.
Bleaman wasn't the only recipient. A nearly identical version was sent to a different patient by another clinic affiliated with 1-800-GET-THIN. Attorney DeFrank says he doesn't know how many of these letters went out, but he said in an email that he asked the senders to stop because PALG did not want to get "mass inquiries."

Once up to speed, the TTS is an able courser, effortlessly dispatching high-speed sweepers with a flat-stanced, cinched-down behavior that allows you to build confidence, corner to corner, until the tires are truly singing. Almost miss your turn? Crank the flat-bottom steering wheel hard and the car will peel away, shuddering a little with front-end push until the Quattro system reasserts itself (the front axle also features an electronically actuated limited-slip differential). Rattle off a couple of gear shifts with the dual-clutch (Audi calls it S tronic, just to bug me) and off you go.

Thomas is that good. A generational player with a huge upside. The kind of college athlete who comes along every so often for a great program in the same way Reggie Bush was for Pete Carroll at USC.

Enticing homeowners to give grills a greater workout year-round requires technical tweaks. At Weber, which has been making grills for almost six decades, about 20,000 grills are assembled daily in its Illinois factories. Researchers in its manufacturing labs place units in an arctic simulator to see if knobs stick or ignition buttons fail in freezing temperatures. Free weights are used to mimic stress of people leaning or sitting on side burners. Labs blow through nearly 100 pounds of salt a month pelting grill parts with a briny fog to induce corrosion similar to what occurs on Florida's coast.

øBut before you switch to a new financial institution, make sure you scrutinize all of its fees, not just those for using a debit card. For example, while Citi doesn't charge a debit card fee, it charges a $10 monthly fee for checking accounts with balances below $1,500. Citi will waive the fee for customers who arrange for one direct deposit and one online bill payment a month.

Tomato juices and Bloody Mary bases abound, but look for something you'd sip even if it didn't get mixed with liquor. A thick liquid is important: "It needs to hold up after you add ice and alcohol to it," Wisner says. Rouge uses Sacramento brand tomato juice, which Wisner says tastes fresh, not "stewed." He also likes V-8 juice (as does prep pro Birnbach) because it contains other veggie juices. And take care with the pepper; a coarse grind will give a gritty taste.
When Joshua Bell is in that first chair, however, Hoosiers can be expected to sit up and take notice.

Pataki, Bruno and Silver gave the schools only 61% of the profits, not 70%. And that was just the beginning. In 2005 under Pataki, and again in 2008 under Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Albany diverted ever bigger shares of slot money to horses, leaving ever smaller ones for kids.
Attorneys said both parents said they hope van der Sloot's next stop is Birmingham, where he faces federal charges accusing him of extorting $25,000 from Beth Holloway to reveal the location of her daughter's body.

Agreed that D-Lee and Ramirez were significant factors in putting the Cubs in a hole.

Lee's absence was not the difference.

I love love love the holidays! Just thinking of the crafts, the gatherings and the food just makes me giddy. Since having kiddos, the best part is experiencing the season through their eyes. It’s truly magical to see them learn about our faith and anticipate our family traditions such as the advent, decorating gingerbread houses, adopting a family to buy gifts for, and of course, Santa. I’m not sure I can think of anything I DON’T like about the holidays … I’m that much of a dork!

Mr. Gerecht's kind of thinking is beyond self-delusional. It is suicidal. Any hope that the Arab Spring and the Middle East elections that result will make any difference in the way radical Islamists deal with or perceive the West is misplaced.

History is full of examples where elections brought to power dictators who then either gamed the system so their re-election was guaranteed or made sure there were no more elections.

Brilliant, brazen, engaging, esoteric, reverent, irreverent, ironic — all are qualities that have forged the 68-year-old director into an unqualified master. Much revered, once reviled, Scorsese has created some of the most extraordinary work in modern cinema: the gangster leitmotif of "Mean Streets," "Goodfellas," "Casino" and "The Departed"; the awakening feminism of "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"; the brutal anger of "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull"; the unsettling treatise on fame in "The King of Comedy"; the respectful religious provocation of the much-maligned "The Last Temptation of Christ"; and on it goes.

The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, has been pushing hard for a trusted-traveler option. It recently commissioned an online survey on the program's feasibility, which not surprisingly found that almost two-thirds of frequent leisure travelers would be willing to go through a pre-screening process if they could potentially cut the TSA line and avoid the pat-down or full-body scan. U.S. Travel's survey also suggested that nearly half of all air travelers would pay an annual fee of up to $150 to belong to such a program.

The Dutch government, one of the euro zone's most enthusiastic advocates of austerity, has little choice but to take the medicine it has prescribed for the euro zone's troubled governments.

A buddy of mine once devised a playful little theory. He said that if you take your middle name and add it to the name of the street where you live, you come up with a great-sounding character for a soap opera. In his case, it formed Charles Briarcliff. We had other friends whose similarly contrived soap-star names were Culver Fairhaven, Lawson Brynwyck and Clement Devonshire. At our house in Webster Groves, my son would have become Briggs Hollywood. Seriously. That's a bit too cheesy. The trick obviously doesn't work every time, though. For ten years, my character's name would have been Gerard Ralph. Not exactly star quality.

Christie said he was intrigued, and a proposal began to come together.

And airlines can make schedule changes without penalty, but if a customer books the wrong date for a trip, change fees are levied.

1. Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Calif.: Sorry Spartans fans, you know this already and are tired of hearing it. But the Rose Bowl is the best football stadium in America. The weather is always nice on New Year's Day. The sun is always shining. The stadium is gorgeous in every sense  from the location to the construction.

The BCS has changed things a little in the last decade, but it somehow hasnt removed the special feeling that a team gets for making it to Pasadena. Every sports fan deserves to see their team play in Pasadena on New Year's Day.

Eastwood's latest film, "J. Edgar," is a bit of both things. It's an actor's dream, a film in which complex roles abound. Oscar nominations will abound, too, no doubt, most likely for Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role, Judi Dench as his controlling mother and Armie Hammer as his longtime assistant and, perhaps, lover.

And Baltimore City, they audaciously claim, will profit. This claim is specious. The enduring promise of major short-term sporting events — that they generate increased jobs and significant tax revenue — has yet to be proven. Most of the jobs are temporary and without benefits. The tax revenue is couched in terms of contingency (expected attendance, weather, media coverage), so profits for the city are at best a vague projection.
"Despite Sherrod Brown's transparent political strategy to mislead Ohio seniors and demagogue Medicare, this serves as another reminder he is the only candidate in Ohio who has voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care," said NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox.

Position a rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 400 degrees. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and pour over the dough. Bake 15 minutes, tent with aluminum foil and continue to bake until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the dough registers 190 degrees, about 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes; unmold and let cool on the rack for 1 hour before serving.
Mmm ... dessert
"No feature of the Obama presidency has been sadder than its constant efforts to divide us, to curry favor with some Americans by castigating others," Daniels said in excerpts released before the address.
Desserts are simple and direct, especially the profiteroles with vanilla bean ice cream and a dark chocolate sauce. Apple hazelnut crostada is a variation on the apple-pie-with-cheddar idea, here substituting goat cheese for the cheddar (with less success). All sweet tooths should like the fluffy warm pistachio brownies served with hot chocolate and marshmallows.
The campaign better positions the campus to compete with its national peers in academics and athletics, but it falls short of what other comparable universities have raised. For instance, the University of Washington announced last year it brought in $2.7 billion.
Congrats: KFJC, the Foothill College station (89.7), won best community college radio station and several other awards at the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System's (IBS) Student Radio Awards ceremonies in New York last month.

Working-class romance spilleth all over this joint. Check out the murals of working-class heroes that adorn the walls of the Tradesman Tavern. That it's in Parma, in an 80-year-old brick building, and is owned by a marble mason give the romance some added emotional grit. But the TT is a hybrid bar; its heart located somewhere between the working class and the Warehouse District. It boasts the kind of wood and stone decor rarely associated with working-class joints. In other words, don't wear overalls.
An elite player whose upside is so huge he has a chance to become a South Side legend on the order of D-Rose.

“I was taking bad shots,” he said. “My head wasn’t in the game. I just didn’t play the way I needed to tonight.”
"Yeah, I thought I was out of bounds," Moore said. "I thought it was kind of a no-brainer. But apparently I was told after the play there's a rule -- you have to at least take a step forward to get out of bounds because if you don't, that means your forward progress is stopped and the ball is probably dead right there. So I could've done a better job of getting out of bounds in hindsight."
As for rival candidate Jerry Brown and his wife, Anne Gust, whose combined fortune is said by his campaign to total "under $10 million"?
More waiting. Then, sometime after 8 p.m., a highway patrolman called from the Coast Guard station at Fort Baker and told Hull that the person who'd been fished from the water on the ocean side of the bridge -- somebody up on the seaward walkway had spotted the body and called authorities -- was his daughter. Hull was shocked. He couldn't believe it. But they had the car, Kathy's driver's license photo and her body. He couldn't disbelieve. He called Steve at Humboldt State and told him. Steve flew home that night.
Kennaugh, a retired Harvard Medical School physician, and his business partner, Amadio, said 19 high-value works were taken during the Sept. 25, 2009, burglary. An untitled Pollock has received the most attention because it has been speculated to be worth up to $40 million.

Coleman, in a statement, said Christie was wrong to blame early releases for the killings.
In the meantime, Mimlitz and Wolf have been working on reformulating Man Dip to take out the preservatives. Worrying about preservatives may not seem like a very "manly" thing for a brand image that harkens to things like "man caves."

Before one could blink, we were hauled over to the processing office and our $256 bill jumped to $772 - of course, taken from our credit card without our authorization. Trying to get through to the rep assigned to handle our claim is impossible; she never is available on the phone. But her assistant was very helpful in informing us that the bill for repairing what he even admitted from the photos was a small, quite insignificant flaw was more than $500.

A vegetarian main course celebrates squash ($19), which he stuffs into tender pasta ravioli and delicately showers with precise cubes of parsnips, celery root and squash interspersed with chanterelles and frilly caps of black trumpet mushrooms. A Parmesan emulsion glazes the top, resembling a delicately veined raku ceramic. It takes a true artist to raise such plebeian ingredients to such uncommon heights.
"The rest of the time," Young said, "those dogs were treated like royalty."
"In 2010, many freshmen Republicans were swept into Congress on the promise of doing things differently," says the report, which the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee forwarded to reporters.

Brett takes Jay and Austin rock-climbing up a mountain. And then, for more adventure, Bob takes Rulon and Irene back to that bungee-jump bridge. Poor Irene is practically quaking in her shoes at the prospect of jumping. "This is freaking me out," she says, and she's not kidding. She keeps saying, "Oh my God, oh my God," and groaning. At last, she takes the plunge. It's exciting to see -- Irene's fear was so palpable, actually doing the jump really does seem like an act of courage.

Myanmar's isolation became profound in 1990 after the military government set aside an election and clamped down on most dissent. Concern about overdependence on China, the country's only major ally, no doubt played a role in the decision to permit a wider political debate.
The reality is that the state has been a declining funding player in higher education since the 1980s  and, as Ben points out, has become a minor funding player in the UC system.
It's almost embarrassing to answer the question of whether or not a socially conservative woman could appeal to feminists, because the answer is a tautology. The two categories -- social conservative and feminist -- are fundamentally opposed on the basic issues of gender roles and women's rights. The libertarian strain of movement conservatism isn't necessarily opposed to women's rights, but the whole point of social conservatism is to roll back the social gains made by various groups, especially women and gay people. Social conservatives may pretty up their views with language about "life" and "family," but at the end of the day, we're seeing a struggle between feminists and anti-feminists.
Caputo said although the bid process has been controversial, he thinks the county is trying to do it right.

By now Sen. Barack Obama has wrapped up a weeklong vacation on Oahu, his boyhood home where — as the local media are quick to remind you — his grandmother and sister still live. During the only official public appearance of his Hawaii R&R trip, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee dropped a few hints of where he might go for some nostalgic noshing. Here's what you should know about the candidate's cravings:

The Bucs signed Vincent Jackson to be quarterback Josh Freeman's No. 1 receiver and should expect a rebound year from Mike Williams. Throw into that receiving mix Blackmon—who would be the "best player available" if Claiborne and Richardson are both gone—Freeman will finally be fully armed to duel to Drew Brees, Cam Newton and Matt Ryan.
The In-Home Supportive Services program, which serves the elderly, disabled and blind, also will be cut, with about 436,000 recipients getting a reduction of 16.5 hours per month of home assistance for things like meal preparation and bathing, according to a Democratic analysis of the cuts' impact.

Renewable generation advocates may have the toughest sell. The state has provided tens of millions of dollars in subsidies to large-scale wind farms in the last five years, but a recently released study commissioned by the Legislature suggests those projects would have gone ahead without state tax credits.
On environmental matters, McCaskill's ranking plummeted last year to a 43 percent rating on the League of Conservation Voters scorecard.

The details: There's something thankless to the errand of finding the right wine for the die-hard Chardonnay fan in your life. (And yes, we know, it's just a euphemism for white wine.) So this year, blow their minds a little with real, dramatic Chardonnay. My pick would be the 2009 Hanzell Sonoma County Chardonnay ($60, 14.5%), which has that trademark Hanzell power - a subtle oak toast (it's a bit like roasted peanut) with fig, pastry cream and a nerve of acidity that gives away its potential. The 2010 Fess Parker Ashley's Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay ($35, 14.1%) gives a more immediate, but plenty gratifying, take.
Scouting report: Hard worker who is a rebounding and defensive force. High-energy player with great quickness, size, strength and athleticism. Most comfortable on the block with a good power move, can face up and shoot or make jump hooks over either shoulder. Former Kansas teammate Markieff Morris, now of the Phoenix Suns, said of Robinson to ESPN The Magazine, "He has the speed of Kobe and a body like LeBron's. Sky's the limit."
In a sign that Kitzhaber's bully pulpit strategy may be working, a subcommittee gave its blessing Friday afternoon to the early learning proposal, House Bill 4165.
Yes, that's likely. There are no big-name coaches in Illinois, except the recently fired Bruce Weber. Bill Self took the name recognition when he trotted off to Kansas awhile back. You think college coaches, you think horse traders like John Calipari, Roy Williams and Jim Boeheim, not Porter Moser.
Last year, the Social Security trustees announced that the program had gone cash negative permanently, meaning revenue from the payroll tax can no longer fully pay for benefit checks. The shortfall was about $46 billion, which increased the federal deficit by the same amount. That followed a shortfall of similar size in 2010.
What does a different response in "cortical control areas" mean? At this point, said Purnell in a phone interview, it means nothing more than that the two substances did prompt different responses in the brain--that the brain did not respond to them identically. Within some of the "cortical control areas" where differences were seen, lie some important neural real estate, including regions where notions of reward and addiction are processed. As scientists have a closer look in future studies, they should be able to zero in on which specific areas are affected differently by the two forms of sugar, he said.

Meanwhile, the governor is pushing for a constitutional amendment to secure funding for local governments so they can provide public services recently shifted to them under the state's "realignment" plan. Passage of the first two could save state costs for death row and incarceration, but likely will be strongly opposed by some victims' rights groups and prosecutors. Rejection of the other would give the state more budget flexibility but would weaken local support for realignment.

This puts them in conflict with another group of chimpanzees, which the filmmakers oddly decide to set up as the bad guys in the story. They are led by "Scar" -- the way the story is told, it's surprising they didn't bring in Jeremy Irons to reprise his "Lion King" voice at this point. Allen uses words like "thugs" to describe Scar's bunch, which, also desperate for food, makes a move onto Freddy's turf. (Freddy's group's hunting and eating of monkeys passes without judgment.)
The Willoughby South Band Boosters hold a number of fundraisers each year. Instead of simply relying on band friends and family to make purchases and attend events, Orlando notes, "we try to bring involvement from the community" by designing fundraisers that appeal to a broad spectrum of the local community.

He said his goal isn't a full-time move from sports to news, as Holliday did in 1989 and former Channel 5 sports director Mike Bush did eight years ago - and he remains the station's lead male anchor. It's a trend not limited to Channel 5. KMOV (Channel 4) sports director Steve Savard fills in occasionally as a news anchor on that station. KTVI (Channel 2) newscaster Randi Naughton used to work in sports.
In Ohio, the state Senate recently passed a bill that would ban new ownership of lions, monkeys and other exotic animals, but allows current owners to keep their animals by obtaining a new state-issued permit by 2014 and meeting other strict conditions. It now goes to the House for consideration. Meanwhile, the Ohio Department of Agriculture announced Monday that it will return five surviving exotic animals, including two leopards, to Terry Thompson's widow, Marian Thompson.
“I saw him after a lap, and he was way up there with the pacer,” Wheating said. “I was like, ‘Oh, whoa. I really hope he has it in him to stay strong.’ And when he was right there with me at the finish, I was: ‘Is this really Travis? This kid is amazing’”

It's easy to imagine that the producers also fell in love with their collaborators — not only the celebrated Kander and Ebb (who died during production) but Stroman herself: After all, she brought with her five Tony Awards, two Laurence Olivier Awards, five Drama Desk Awards, eight Outer Critics Circle awards and four Fred Astaire Awards, and directed and choreographed one of the biggest hits in recent memory, "The Producers."
Comment: Osweiler's decision to leave Arizona State after his junior year was a bit of a surprise, especially considering he was a starter for only one full season, but the towering quarterback may be vindicated with talk of a potential first-round selection. Scouts may be seduced by his arm strength and athleticism - he originally planned to play basketball at Gonzaga before choosing football - especially since his uncommon height allows him to easily see over linemen and make all the throws.

ESPN cameras were rolling when he reeled in a 650-pound blue marlin off the coast of Costa Rica, but he isn’t one for telling tales about the big ones he has caught. Instead, what stands out is one he missed.

Sound of Ideas: The phone lines lit up and commenters continued the conversation online after Thursday's show on plans to bring retail and housing to the closed-down Oakwood Country Club. Fran Mentch, leader of Severance Neighborhood Organization, which is organizing the opposition, said neighbors believe there's plenty of retail nearby and such a development is bad for the region. She proposed that Developer Mitchell Schneider, who has purchased 62 acres in South Euclid and has an option to buy 92 more in Cleveland Heights, donate the land as a park instead. He dismissed the idea: "I hope moving forward that we can get realistic and not be talking about false notions because we are not going to be making a donation of this land."
"Huh?" I responded in a demonstration of clever repartee.

Now Branch is the veteran among the receivers, no longer the young pup alongside David Patten and Troy Brown. He was with the Seahawks during Super Bowl XLII, and sat in his basement rooting for the Patriots.

Pages 40-46: April Hill, a full-time executive assistant at the arboretum, was at her desk inside the visitors center that afternoon. She knew police had been summoned, and she saw her boss outside the visitors center awaiting the arrival. Suddenly, through her office window, she saw a police officer, gun drawn and aimed, walking backwards away from her. She walked toward the window, but when she heard two gunshots, she ducked behind a filing cabinet. From there, she heard another two shots fired, and she estimated that 20 seconds had passed between the first two shots and the second two. She waited a while longer, then returned to her desk. After police arrived, she said she drew the window blinds and went back to work.

Back at the Detour, Marcus and Amani are almost done with their challenge, as Laurence and Zac finish their boat race. Meanwhile, Oregonians Bill and Cathi check into the Pit Stop in third place, a fact that surprises Phil, but in a good way. As Marcus hauls his last person to shore, he asks Amani to get the crowd going so he can pretend it's the Super Bowl or something. Then, Laurence and Zac decide to U-turn Marcus and Amani because Laurence and Zac are one of the last teams and they're worried they won't make it. Also, bad karma apparently means nothing to them.

Timothy Wheeler's article about the tree planting efforts surrounding the Baltimore Grand Prix raises more questions than it answers ("Grand Prix trees finally getting planted — at taxpayer expense," May 7).

There's certainly a compelling case to be made for adding criminal penalties to Maryland's child abuse reporting law, as recently suggested by state Sen. Nancy Jacobs, a Harford County Republican. For one, it would send a clear message that those who witness abuse and fail to report it — or worse, deliberately cover it up — are culpable, not just those who actually commit such crimes. It might also give people who would rather not get involved in the messy process of a child abuse investigation a reason to overcome their reluctance to implicate a neighbor, acquaintance or family member. Such people could tell themselves they had no choice but to act or face criminal prosecution themselves. Given that 90 percent of child victims are abused by people they know, that could be a powerful incentive for witnesses to step forward.
For the final touch, Smith got an open 3 from the left wing and swished it with 16.3 seconds left, then gave his "OK" sign one last time.

What is both ambitious and grand is the film's stylish look. McTeigue, working with director of photography Danny Ruhlmann, is only getting better at creating richly textured environments for his characters. He's traded the futuristic London dystopia he mined in "V for Vendetta" for the dark cobblestone streets of Baltimore circa 1849, with Budapest and Belgrade subbing in.
James finished with seven rebounds and six assists. He lost at least six assists on open jump shots missed by West, Z, Sasha Pavlovic, Mo Williams, Daniel Gibson and Wally Szczerbiak.

Eastern State Penitentiary opened in 1829 on a former cherry orchard and housed prison escape artist "Slick Willie" Sutton and Al Capone. The pen closed in 1971 and has been recast into one of the most popular tourist attractions in Philadelphia. Visitors wander through a frozen ruin of crumbling cell blocks, vacant exercise yards, a lonley Death Row and the prison surveillance hub. The joint reopened for public tours in 1994 and is now billed as "America's Most Historic Prison."

"Kronwall comes back," Backes said. "(Stewart) has already been penalized for five (minutes) and missing the game ... a five-minute power play against Detroit can be a death sentence. I don't know. You look at the criteria put forth. (Stewart) has never been suspended before, never had a hearing before. Kronwall looks injured on the play, but he comes back. Is it an ugly hit? Yeah, it's not pretty. But he's a hard-nosed guy that has to play with that edge to be effective out there."
"The idea of the invocation is to bring everyone together." Actually, an invocation is a prayer at the beginning of a meeting usually asking for guidance and wisdom in their deliberations and/or decisions. What is wrong with that? But this reluctance on the part of the council and the mayor seemingly supports his fear that any invocation might offend someone, especially if it even remotely references a deity.
The federal government reports four safety recalls of the 2012 S60. One involved the electrical wiring harness under the front seats that might disconnect, thereby jeopardizing the deployment of frontal and side air bags in a crash. Two safety recalls involved potential faulty fuel delivery that could cause the cars to stall in traffic. A fourth recall involved improper labels with tire inflation information for accessory spare tires. As a result, owners might put the wrong air pressure into these tires, which increases the risk of tire failure.

June's audit found that victims of sexual assault in Portland face one obstacle after another, from the initial 9-1-1 call to their hospital exams to interviews with detectives. A review by The Oregonian of hundreds of pages of interviews and working papers used to compile the audit revealed a much more detailed picture of the bureau's problems.
The effectiveness of this Recall is in question, even if the petition gets the 4,000 signatures needed to put it on the ballot. In November there is question of its making any difference as the Recall is designed for current Council members terms while the election is for future council members. In June, the cost would be higher and it could put Pacifica in the position of having two more vacancies on the Council until new members could be appointed.
