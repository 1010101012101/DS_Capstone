The board said Lariviere defied its directions by lobbying for UO in the Legislature, giving pay raises to faculty and administrators last spring and missing some board meetings. His last day as president is Dec. 28.

One of the challenges for a show like "Grimm" is to keep viewers interested in the overarching story about Nick (David Giuntoli), his Grimm heritage, and the world of supernatural creatures Grimms are charged with keeping an eye on. If the show gets too serialized as it reveals info about the Grimm world, casual viewers may feel daunted about diving in. But if they just keep dropping vague mentions of Grimm stuff, more committed viewers can get impatient.

Easy on the ears. Power tools are noisy, and too much blasting from a loud motor isn't healthy at any age. Give some high-quality headphones that will block noise and protect hearing in loud workshops and when power tools are in use. Save some green by choosing a speakerless set -- not designed for listening to music; they only block sound. Example: Direct Sound HP-25 speakerless headphones sell for around $40. And look for built-in sound control in the tools you select. Example: The engine, fan housing and exhaust tube on Husqvarna's 356B T backpack blower for large yards is insulated to dampen noise, which is good for the operator and for the neighbors.

INDIANAPOLIS — Al Kelly’s left arm is in a sling, and it’s driving him crazy, because it’s messing with his sense of order. And he needs things orderly.

Chef David Slay loves to leave the roots attached to lettuces. It gives the greens an appealing, just-picked appearance, but requires devotion to proper washing. In this dish he uses roots-on mache, a dark green lettuce that clusters in small loose heads. Bright green and tender, the delicate leaves have pronounced sweetness and subtle nuttiness. Sometimes it is labeled “lamb's lettuce,” a name acquired due to the leaf's resemblance to the shape of a lamb's tongue. It is sold in cellophane bags at Trader Joe's.

Ruby arrived in horrible condition. She was completely emaciated, just skin and bones. Thanks to the loving care of her foster family, Ruby is more healthy and beautiful than we ever could have imagined. Ruby is a smart lady and has already learned the commands sit, lay down, lay down over there, paw, kennel up, and hugs. She is working on her loose leash walking too. Ruby gets along well with dogs, cats and even has met chickens and rabbits through a cage and is pretty much uninterested in them! Ruby adores children. She is nervous with men and her foster family is working to teach her that they are okay. Ruby appreciates it if a man leaves her alone at first and gives her a few minutes to warm up. It just takes her a bit of time! She has quickly learned to love and respect the man of the house in her foster home. Ruby would do well in a quieter home, as she is a quieter type of dog. Gentle corrections do the trick for Ruby, and a harsh correction would upset her feelings. Ruby is a true GEM and deserves a loving home! She will continue to stay in foster care learning and growing while she waits for the perfect family to find her!

After dinner came a gradual winding down, generally with a recounting of the day's experiences - rubbing noses with a sea lion, a peaceful swim in a turquoise bay, an iPhone video of dolphins bow-riding - and, for some, star-gazing, cocktails and the subsequent philosophizing that often follows.
Which is part of the appeal. Author Dave Eggers, who worked with Sendak on the 2009 film adaptation of Wild Things, recalls his mother reading the book to him when he was a toddler: "I was really scared by it. I was used to tidier narratives with a clear message of who's good and who's bad. But Sendak's monsters weren't simple or cute."

The Fiesta Bowl would be fine not hosting a bowl in certain years, if it can host a playoff game. On the other hand, the Rose Bowl would prefer to just be the Rose Bowl, sticking with its traditional matchup of Big Ten champion vs. Pac-12 champion on New Year's Day. But those league champions will often be heading to the playoffs in a new format.
"I wanted it to be like the black-and-white to color switch in ‘The Wizard of Oz'," Anderson says of the track. "I wanted to do this thing with fidelity and showcase it, make people think about what ideas and emotions and preconceptions they have attached to different fidelities. We use the same instruments, the song goes on, but we record the parts on different machines. What does that mean?"

Hot Sauce Williams, 7815 Carnegie Ave., Cleveland, 216-391-2230: This institution has been zinging tongues and soothing tummies for decades. To call it a home-style place doesn't do Hot Sauce justice. The menu was actually born out of home recipes the Williams brothers grew up on in Tupelo, Miss. Based on the taste of the chicken wings and ribs -- not to mention the sauce, which is a balance of tangy and spicy without being insanely hot -- it must've been a happy home.
When the European Union started nuclear talks with Iran in 2003, Tehran had not even completed the construction of its only known uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, and it was not enriching uranium. By the time President Barack Obama was sworn in, Iran was already enriching uranium at 3.5 percent levels, thousands of centrifuges had been installed at Natanz, and work was proceeding at a number of nuclear sites.

On the west side, sculpture exhibitions will be arranged on a sloping lawn on the former site of the Asian Art Museum. A Noguchi garden and rows of formal white camellia Japanese-style hedges edge a wide path bordering the Tea Garden fence wall. It narrows to a walkway toward JFK Drive. There (because Golden Gate Park was always a park full of hidden gardens and follies, Hood explains), behind black bamboo, is the entrance to a folly by sculptor James Turrell. His Three Gems is a subterranean stupa-shaped dome with an oculus to view the sky. Three Gems is hidden within a dune Hood designed for the site long before Turrell conceived the idea. "He simply mined the hill for his piece," says Hood.

The owners of 98,000 homes in Baltimore receive at least some benefit from the homestead credit this year. The remaining 25,000 get nothing, either because their home values have plummeted or, like Burdick, they bought within the past few years and have had no increases to cap. Renters are also on the losing end of the homestead equation — landlords aren't eligible for the break and pass the cost of their higher tax bills on to their tenants.
• Zoar Village, founded by German separatists in 1817, was an experiment in communal living that thrived for much of the 19th century. The society dissolved in 1898, but the village remains a fascinating place to tour -- for years to come, we hope. The town is threatened by a failing levee, and the community has launched a campaign to save the town. Details: zca.org.

Lesson number one is simple: Cherish humanity. It's what should have bound us to the 11 victims. We should never forget them. Our care for them is the strongest thing that separates us from the savagery of the killer and the alarming indifference of those who foolishly believe that the deaths of these women has no bearing on their own environment.
CBS strives to maintain its edge in hard-news reporting. It promoted Scott Pelley as anchor of the "CBS Evening News" last year, replacing Katie Couric. The network this year began a revamp of its "CBS This Morning" program with the installation of Charlie Rose, a pivot designed to inject a more serious tone into a genre that has become increasingly soft. CBS News chief Fager has said he believes that viewers still care about news with substance.

When considering Amsterdam, its famous red-light district and the coffee shops where cannabis is smoked, you may assume it's less than an ideal city to visit with young children. But you would be wrong. On a visit here last summer with Danny, 8, and Fiona, 6, we had a few, um, educational moments. Fiona wanted to know why all the women in the windows looked "like they were getting ready for a party." (I guess because they were wearing lipstick and underwear and that's all.) And both kids were shocked, shocked that so many people smoked. (They could not, thank heavens, identify what was being smoked.) But those two issues occupied only 10 seconds of our four days in Amsterdam. (OK, the drunken singing by Italian fans as they celebrated their country's World Cup victory took up an hour or two, at 3 a.m.)

Teachers unions and statisticians have criticized the rankings' wide margins of error and actual mistakes within the data, which spanned three years from 2007 through 2010. The city relied on teachers to verify class rosters, but fewer than half did so in 2009-10. Of those who checked, 47% found at least one error, officials said Monday. Some teachers were listed with an entirely incorrect class.

First, the original had the couple going to England to avoid violence in America. So when things go bad in England - a more civilized place, right? - the message that man is a violent animal hits hard. Going to the Deep South, with its embrace of football and hunting, removes that important aspect of the film's thematic equation.

The Great Thumb Fire: A decade later, this blaze broke out in early September 1881 in a heavily logged area of the Thumb that had suffered through several months of drought. The flames burned more than a million acres in Sanilac, Lapeer, Tuscola and Huron counties, killed 282 people and caused an estimated $2.3 million in damage (more than $53 million in 2012 dollars). It was the first disaster to which Clara Barton's newly formed American Red Cross responded.

3. Kudos to the Cardinals for making the quick decision to retire Tony La Russa's No. 10. Great manager, historically prominent manager, an obvious move. One thing that intrigues me though: I think that Billy Southworth has to be one of the most (if not the most) overlooked figures in Cardinals history. He managed the Cardinals for 6+ seasons. He went 620-346 for an astounding winning percentage of .642. The Cardinals won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 with Southworth as manager, and the 1943 team won 105 games and the NL pennant. No, Southworth's career as manager was relatively short, but he led an amazing run for the franchise. In a pleasant surprise, the Veterans Committee honored Southworth by voting him into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. I believe the Cardinals should do more to recognize Southworth's prominent role in one of the most illustrious eras in franchise history.

The league is using a new and redesigned soccer ball this season.
The tip: Another trick worth trying is called cross-processing. I loaded several rolls of transparency film in one of the Holgas but had the transparency film processed in color negative chemistry. (Most labs will do it for you; just ask for your film to be cross-processed. ) The resulting images will be lime green in appearance, but once you scan the image and correct for the green in Photoshop, the images look slightly sepia, slightly magenta, with a hint of green. The final pictures look like the faded, old color prints from the '50s. The pinhole camera is a study in simplicity. The basics of light, composition and exposure still play a role, but the unexpected results are what make it adventuresome.
About 60 politicians backed students seeking admission to the Urbana-Champaign campus in 2008 and 2009, according to records kept by the university's governmental relations office, which tracked the inquiries from lawmakers and other politically connected individuals.

Concussion is a medical condition about which there is a lot of misinformation. Many parents believe your child must be a star athlete to experience a concussion.

There's two or three different routes I’d go. One is to get together with a buddy who can code a little and make an iPhone game. It doesn't need to set the world on fire, but it shows that you can make decisions and see a project to completion. So many amateurs start working, then get bored or distracted. Seeing someone finish a project is huge. I would also become super active in the gaming community online. We’ve hired people who ran fan sites, and they’ve become spokespeople for our games in their own right, by corralling peoples’ attention just through being a superuser. Blizzard in particular promotes a lot from within.

Authentic Neapolitan pizzas --whole and unsliced, with minimal toppings --are the stars. They arrive thin and chewy-crisp, a little sour and mottled with the essential bitter black spots that signal a dance with wood fire. Flavors can be jaw-dropping --perhaps smoky paprika salami mingled with the deep tang of Hungarian pickled peppers, or shiitake mushrooms and salty pancetta set off by a whole duck egg sitting at dead center.
Reed College in Portland will test the iPad this fall in a political science class on the origins and effects of the spread of nuclear weapons.
Industry and its allies in Congress also criticized the proposed rules, saying they would be an additional burden for oil and gas operators, which already face varying regulations imposed by different states.

100. Chris Greenwood, CB, Albion, 6-1, 193. Ran a 4.41 at Michigan's pro day with a staggering 43-inch vertical jump. This Division III player did what a small-program player has to do to get noticed by the NFL -- dominate every down in every way. Was rarely challenged by opposing quarterbacks, yet his team led the conference in interceptions with 15 because he simply changed the way offenses played. He returned one of his two interceptions for a touchdown.

He was arrested for trespassing.

Let the meat cool in the liquid. Refrigerate meat and sauce separately. The next day, carve the meat against the grain and arrange in a baking dish. Skim any surface fat from the sauce, then warm the sauce in a saucepan and taste for seasoning. If it seems too thin, simmer it until reduced to your taste. Spoon the sauce over the meat, cover and bake in a moderate oven until the meat is hot throughout.

With all of the horses seemingly healthy -- and you know how quickly that can change -- the focus here will be on the style of the race. Trinniberg, as I wrote in my story on the draw, is the wild card. Having never raced more than seven furlongs, his connections nevertheless feel convinced that their horse will win the race. Does such wild-eyed confidence mean they're prepared to let him dash from the gates and see how far he'll go? Top trainers such as Bob Baffert and Graham Motion deferred when asked yesterday how they thought the race might unfurl, saying that it would be up to the jockeys.

In that regard, it seems nearly everyone thinks they can be a children's book writer, as evidenced by the many works now on offer from movie stars and politicians' wives. Indeed, not more than three weeks ago on a beach in the Yucatán, I was accosted by a lawyer from Portland who, learning what I did, asked if he might send me his writings for kids.

With all the shoot-outs, the screaming, the chases, collisions and fireballs, there isn't much time for storytelling (unless you count the piffle spouted during a dinner-party scene that's meant to illuminate the movie's theme), very little time devoted to the search for an antidote to the bizarre ailment (it's found with comic speed), and next to no time for the resolution.
