Mr. Jobs looked over the horizon and figured out not only what's next, but how to shape it into devices that all at once stirred a cognitive soup of psychology, behavior science, philosophy and for many, a spiritual awakening—an iPhone as a cortexial extension of ourselves.

The ship was built in Italy, and Cunard is owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp., but Cunard hasn't forgotten its British roots, to the delight of its many British passengers. (Baked beans at breakfast and all.) Formal nights are a must. We had one on our cruise, and it was lovely to see women in real evening gowns, not cobbled together make-do outfits.

Without Guthrie, says Kristofferson, there might not have been a Dylan, and without Dylan, there's no understating how differently music might have evolved. "Everything changed with him," he said.

Comment From Dick: How about pets, particularly dogs that need to go outside, and particularly a young puppy? I realize you're not a vet, but could a puppy nosing around the beach here get enough radioactive iodine to be a concern?

The argument is made that children are psychologically better off with two parents of the opposite sex than with two parents of the same sex. There is no evidence to support this assertion, but it also completely misses the point. The debate is not over whether gay and lesbian couples should have children; they, of course, will do so or not for the same reasons that heterosexual couples decide whether to reproduce.

2010 Whispering Angel Rosé, France ($16-$20): Rosés are also a wonderful all-around food wine. They have more alcohol and some have more red wine-like stuffing, so they tend to be amazing with cured meats, turkey, ham, pork and chicken. If there are a lot of sweet dishes on your Thanksgiving table, this rosé will get a little hot, but in general any rosé (including Buehler White Zinfandel) will be lovely. The color is pale pink with some onion-peel tones. The aroma is focused with a hint of wild strawberry and red fruit. There is some earth in the background that is attractive. The flavor is bright and refreshing with some of the red fruit sneaking into the palate. 88 points.

A college friend once told me how her grandfather, an American airman, had hunched down into the nose of an army plane to shoot aerial photographs of the aftermath.

Harry Oldenburger was a gifted, effective, popular teacher, but I only had him for one class, Bible as Literature.

The stars of the film weren't exactly household names -- yet -- and audiences weren't so vampire crazy as they would become.

Judicial restraint has many definitions. The courts that upheld the health care law felt they should stand aside and grant acts of Congress a presumption of constitutionality. What we need now, however, is a different brand of restraint -- the kind that says courts should not inject themselves into ferocious political controversies, especially when existing law gives them a reason to hesitate.

The first thing that you notice upon opening the container is how very white this product is! I had visions of leaving the house looking like some type of mime, but I found the powder to be really amazing. It vanishes completely upon application, leaving a flawless finish that does not cake in any under-eye creases. It covers any shininess and leaves behind a natural glow.

The Bobcats have other evidence on their roster of the hit-or-miss quality of relying on draft picks. Brown is arguably the biggest disappointment ever taken with the No. 1 pick (by Washington in 2001). Forward Tyrus Thomas, whom the Blazers chose No. 4 in 2006, never panned out for Chicago, which traded the draft rights to No. 2 pick LaMarcus Aldridge to Portland for Thomas and Viktor Khryapa on draft day.

Genre considerations aside, though, Urban delivered more than a few moments of pure enjoyment, especially when he spotlighted his own guitar playing.

He hasn't played wide receiver or tight end in a game since high school, but he wowed scouts with strength, speed and receiving abilities in his workout. Thompson is likely a top-100 pick in this draft, especially because the overall class at TE is weak, but he's still a bit of an unknown going beyond the workout numbers.

Columbia is also where they keep the Pulitzers in the off-season; American journalism’s most treasured self-affirmation program is more or less run from the university’s J-school. Since the awards are soon to be presented, and since the AP’s lust for one is almost comically transparent, its show-the-flag campus visit is wholly unsurprising.

What makes this campaign particularly unpleasant is that it's being framed by people who are counting seats 3,000 miles away. None of this is being done to the benefit of those of us who will be represented by either the goon or the rube.

Ebanks tried using his 6-9 size in hopes of accomplishing two things: limit Durant's looks and make any shots more difficult. Ebanks managed the former by holding Durant to two field goal attempts in the first six minutes of the fourth quarter. He accomplished the latter by blocking Durant's 14-foot jumper with 6:07 remaining and strongly contesting Durant's missed three-pointer at the end of the fourth quarter that forced overtime.
Clearly, the world of clever marketing passed me by long ago. "Blood" is awfully far down the list among words that I'd put in a restaurant's name, and 'sand" isn't that far behind it. And even if a silver-tongue hospitality impresario convinced me that the title of a 1920s Rudolf Valentino movie and its namesake cocktail held just the cachet to attract a loyal, free-spending clientele, I would have tried to sell him the new Mississippi River bridge when he told me that he intended to run the place as a members-only establishment.

These are grapes that may not be on the tip of your tongue - Frontenac, Chambourcin, St. Pepin and Marechal Foch - and that is yet another reason to try these wines. The Champagne region, about 90 miles northeast of Paris on the way to France's border with Luxembourg, is generally cool, like Illinois. This means the grapes grown there (and here) never have a chance to fully ripen and thus their acidity remains high, which is perfect for sparkling wines. High acidity and bubbles is what makes sparkling wine so versatile with food. It would not be a bad idea to have a few bottles of Illinois sparkling wine on hand at all times since we now have a producer who is turning out some really nice ones.
"They put together a picture of what those of that era faced," she said. "They focused on everyday people, not the famous, and showed how events affected them. The stories make the war personal."

Karam takes us into the world of three misfit students, Howie, Solomon, and Diwata, who find themselves entangled in a rather uncomfortable school sex scandal.

Although it only takes two aldermen to "defer and publish"- a parliamentary maneuver that delays a vote on any matter until the next meeting - it was far from certain Wednesday that any two aldermen would be so bold.

Hardest thing about playing your instrument: Carrying it around. Also, reconciling how relatively little physical effort some things take, relative to the level of emotional intensity you're trying to project.

Because the settlement is limited in scope, the penalties to be paid — more than $25 billion worth of aid to borrowers and states if California participates — is small relative to the total amount of property value lost in the housing bust.
