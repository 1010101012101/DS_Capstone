A: Some people were really pleased and proud. Some people felt awful. All of the stories are anonymous, but some people didn't want them to be used anyway, and if they ask me not to use them, I won't use them. Some people know what I do, and they go out of their way to tell me their stories.

These encouraging figures are also true for California. The Golden State's exports to Mexico in 2011 reached $26 billion, which represented 16.3 percent of all California exports. This number translates into California exporting to Mexico $71 million in products every single day. California's sales to Mexico increased by 24.3 percent from 2010 to 2011. Since NAFTA entered into force in 1994, they have grown by 299 percent, while those to the rest of the world rose 126 percent. Today, nearly 700,000 California jobs depend on trade with Mexico.
Growth is putting the squeeze on Hyundai and Kia factories. But the affiliated companies will build as many vehicles as possible at two U.S. plants before constructing a new factory. John Krafcik, Hyundai's U.S. CEO, says the first choice is to find areas inside the plants that are slowing the assembly lines and fix them, "because plants are expensive."

Comment: There's little doubt that Jenkins is a first-round pick based on his on-field production and a case can be made that he is the best cornerback prospect in this draft. Perhaps no player, however, comes with more baggage than Jenkins, whose football skills and athletic ability have been overshadowed by character flaws and several run-ins with the law.

"I would imagine just the amount of outside support – all of the kind of D.C. special interests - that have lined up with Cruz over the last year certainly shows that he seems to be getting a little more traction than Leppert, who really hasn't gotten any of that kind of establishment or institutional support," Morgan said.

A crowd of 1,200 packed the sanctuary for the 9 a.m. service, along with another 1,000 who came for an 11 a.m. service. CeCe Winans, the acclaimed gospel and R&B singer, made the sanctuary ring with a rousing rendition of the hymn "The Blood Will Never Lose its Power." She was accompanied by the church’s choir and band, who already had the crowd clapping and on its feet after performing a series of high-energy spirituals to open the service.
Five years later, at the age of 37, Steinbrenner merged Kinsman with the American Shipbuilding Co., and six years after that made arguably the best investment of his life. With his share of just $168,000 (and considerably more from a host of partners) he bought the Yankees from CBS chairman William S. Paley. The $8.8 million the group paid was a markdown of some $5 million from Paley’s purchase price nine years earlier.

Now, Mizzou knows not only where players will be on the floor but also approximately when and how long each of them will be out there. Dixon plays 26.5 minutes a game, fourth on the team. Such definition has helped discipline and hone Dixon's game, even if he might still be prone to recklessness - and even if assistant coach Isaac Chew still calls him "Tasmanian Devil" and "Squirrel" because he's always on the move and "always into something."

At the new Eddie Aikau Restaurant and Surf Museum in the Waikoloa resort, Maui-born chef Scott Lutey uses at least 14 different local providers for ingredients such as grass-fed beef, tomatoes, pohole ferns (a Hawaiian version of fiddleheads), salad greens, mushrooms, taro, 'ohi'a lehua honey (delicious in vinaigrettes), macadamia nuts, fish, lobster and coffee. It's part of an initiative called Malama Pono (loosely, "do the right thing") to support local farmers, conceived by co-owners and local boys Brandon and Ryan Lee. While the handsome, plantation-style restaurant may be more of a special-occasion setting for locals, prices are at the lower end of what the luxury resorts in the area charge, with generous portions and artful platings. (And if you can't spring for Big Island beef tenderloin, try the local grass-feed burger.)
Quinton has managed PDC's business and industry division, which is responsible for business recruitment and retention with special emphasis on "clusters" of employment industries unique to Portland.

In general, we support the House's position — and, it should be noted, the Senate eventually agreed to it before the clock ran out on the session's last day. Maryland does still face some budget challenges next year, but they are much smaller than those it has dealt with in recent memory. With some signs that the economy's recovery may strengthen in the months ahead, it would be reasonable to take a more conservative position on taxes and wait to see whether revenues improve more than expected. That said, the difference between the two chambers' positions is minuscule in the context of the state budget, and even in the context of most families' budgets. Both sides should be willing to compromise here for the greater good.
Thompson alienated much of the technology industry in March when he decided to sue Facebook for alleged infringement on some of Yahoo's Internet patents. The lawsuit has been skewered in Silicon Valley as a cheap shot at Facebook Inc. as it prepared to complete an initial public offering of stock that is aiming to raise as much as $13.6 billion for the company and its current shareholders. Yahoo critics also viewed the lawsuit as the desperate act of a company that has run out of good ideas.

It seems incredible in our age of obsessive fact-checking, but until the early 1700s, "truth was of a general quality; it wouldn't have occurred to anyone that every detail happened precisely as described." In 1719, when Daniel Defoe published his novel "The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner" -- with a subtitle identifying the book as having been "Written by Himself" -- it marked a drastic shift in the way people approached literature. That book broke ground for a deluge of novels that seemed like memoirs, and autobiographies that read like fiction. With these changes came a greater need for critical readers.

This crop of nominees most closely resembles the 1997 show when art house films like "Shine," "Secrets and Lies," "Fargo" and "The English Patient" dominated the slate. While Luckenbill denies that NBC is concerned about ratings, historically audiences for movie award shows are smaller when fewer people have seen the nominated films. It's like watching the Tony awards when you aren't familiar with any of the plays.
Our troops may be able to move more quickly than expected to a largely advisory role. But such a move shouldn't be rushed solely because of the bin Laden raid.

The number of illegal immigrants and families is actually much larger than 11 million. The Pew Hispanic Center reports that 4 million of the 11 million have children. And McClatchey Newspapers reports that "Hispanics are the only ethnic group now producing more than two children per family." So the total of illegal immigrants with children comes to 19 million-plus. Most of the children are U.S. citizens by dint of birth in the U.S.

Yet the truth was that bin Laden's call for worldwide jihad was a facade, masking his true aim: the overthrow of the Saudi royal family, against whom he turned in 1990 after it spurned his offer to supply mujahedeen forces to avenge Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The Saudis went with a U.S. troop offer instead. That was also the source of bin Laden's anti-U.S. animus, a demonization that grew opportunistically over time.

On one level, Manley's success in this regard is anything but ingenious. He works usually seven days a week, and on a daily schedule punishing enough to warrant his more than $245,000 annual salary plus benefits. That's not easy given Manley's complex family. He and his wife, consultant Susanne Hashim, have a 4-year-old daughter, Chedin. Manley also has a 26 year-old son, Dashiell, from a previous marriage; Hashim has a 16-year-old daughter, Karina, and a 20-year-old son, Johan, from her first marriage. The family lives in Southwest Portland near Washington Park.

"I think of it as a nice hybrid of the way the U.S. national team used to play and the way that the game is evolving into much like the men's game, a possession, Barcelona-esque style," Wambach said. "It hasn't been without troubles. It's sometimes gotten the best of us because we have some players, like myself, who are old school and like to get the ball in a more physical, direct style.

But with the exception of Richardson, this year’s crop of running backs will be used to fill voids instead of defining offenses. Whether it’s Utah State’s Robert Turbin — an extremely strong power back — going to a team that already has a finesse, third-down back or someone like the agile James going to a team that already has their bruiser, it will be intriguing to see how this class fits together.
"The wind was whipping but people took it in stride," Mirosevich said. "We had over 100 poetry submissions and entrants came from 20 different cities in total, including Anchorage, Ottawa and New Orleans. We counted another hundred who came either as family members or supporters or those who just walked on the pier or enjoyed the singers and poets. It was a great joy to look out at the pier railing throughout the afternoon and see people with their clipboards gazing out at the sea and then jotting something down." Many "pier poets" would come up to Mirosevich later to share the thrill they experienced from being so inspired.

So is sax coming back? In some pop precincts, it never went away. House producers love saxophone; in fact, there’s a subgenre of dance records that feature samples of whining sax where lead vocals might otherwise be.

It is not coincidence that De Soto's fortunes started to climb about the time the 3-pointer became part of the game. While most merely dabbled with the three, De Soto plunged in head first. Davis turned Stephan Baker and Mike Parmeley loose from behind the arc. The two combined for more than 100 3-pointers in 1987-88 and made more than 50 percent of their attempts.

Bromfield admits she misses coaching – a lot. While watching matches, she feels like she wants to get out on the sidelines and start shouting instructions. When the Kennedy boys team fell to 0-3 this year, Bromfield said she went home, cried and wondered if she made the right decision. Soon after, she pulled the team together for a quick clinic and the Knights have since won five straight matches.
Whether Wobber's suicide was planned or executed on impulse, moreover, had it been prevented, there was a strong possibility that Wobber would not have tried a repeat performance. Almost uniformly, Bateson points out, those who have survived leaps from the bridge have stated that in the very first millisecond of their four-second fall down 220 feet to oblivion, they regretted their decision.

A: That's really complicated. "Seinfeld," for instance, was a very specific show, and it had a strong point of view and was as popular as any sitcom in history. Stuff that tries to appeal to a lot of people is often white noise and forgettable. Our marching orders are: Keep it as specific to what you think is funny as you like. But it has to be about what is going on in the world. Not politics necessarily. It has to feel relevant. When I was at "SNL," I would constantly get in arguments, "Why aren't we more political? We're not going after Bush." Then look what happened — that Sarah Palin season, they were on fire. It was about something. When we had Paris Hilton respond to John McCain (on Funny or Die), that's when I felt our site working.

Either way, the Troutdale location is not likely to prove popular with conservation groups. The national scenic act requires protection of air quality in an area that extends both within and outside its boundaries. PGE is closing the Boardman coal plant because the expense to upgrade it to meet stricter air quality standards was prohibitive. While coal plants emissions are far worse, natural gas plants still emit nitrogen oxides that cause haze and acid deposition.

Image was never important to her. The line drawing of her on the cover of her debut album was ambiguous: was she black or white?

The Answer: The key thing for us is to start bringing clarity to the brand. The brand has been very strong on two aspects: value leadership and the quality proposition. We lost a little bit of the profile on both in the past. So what we're doing is making sure that we gain back on value and on quality. Quality means that our customers and non-customers know that we have a superior 4G network. And because we were late in the data game, the perception among non-customers is that we have an inferior network -- so it's really correcting a misperception in the market.

In 1960 in Ohio, Nixon (who, by heritage, could be considered an Ohioan) beat Massachusetts Democrat Kennedy by about 273,000 votes (albeit, some of those Nixon votes were the product of now-pass anti-Catholicism).

Q. We attended a birthday party for a kid from school. The mother was nice, but the kid just misbehaved. When the character came out to say happy birthday to him, he punched the character in the face. He totally ignored my son at the party. Since none of the parents talked to each other, three of us (my son, my husband and me) just ate and tried to enjoy ourselves. Later I found out that the mother is probably a single parent. At the end, I felt very discouraged and awkward, since my son even told me this kid likes monsters, and we had to spend time to choose a monster present for him. The very next day, my son told me that this kid refused to play with him again. I just told my son to play with other kids instead of him.

Well, Dan, it is hard to argue with you today. Like you, I was in the trenches last night watching the returns with the undergraduates at the University of California Washington Center. After midnight Eastern time, I was walking through the celebrating crowds on my way to various media commitments. The euphoria among young voters was astounding.

The state could change its rules to allow itself to issue more debt to pay for the new projects, but that's a dangerous business. Maryland enjoys AAA ratings from all three major bond rating agencies, in large part because of a history of strong fiscal management, and changing the debt standards would be a step in the wrong direction. There's no way of knowing whether such a move would lead to a credit downgrade, but the state can ill afford to take the chance. Debt service is already the fastest-growing component of the state budget; paying higher interest rates would only make matters worse.

I'm writing a book on ending marijuana prohibition, and as I've written here before I think it will happen in a matter of years rather than decades. The California Field Poll shows 56 percent support for legalization, the government lies about marijuana are fast unraveling, everybody knows prohibition is all costs and no benefits, and legislation and an initiative have been introduced.
Then the Ducks made it all the way, winning the championship series – with a captivating story line of Dana Altman’s new and former (Creighton) teams – in three games. Two of those were in Eugene, with an average crowd of 8,605. The Ducks made money.

Another gray area of the situation is that there is no set of standards for attributing pre-existing material. Deriving inspiration from another composer's work is much different from lifting entire sections of a piece right out of another composer's score.

Jones has added a dimension for them they didn’t have last year. They mix it up. … I like their lines. They may not be as big as they’ve been, but they’re still bigger than everybody else. The big guy Kitching is their best guy. … You can break the big play on their defense. Jefferson did it, Clinton did it a little and Erasmus will have to, to win."

“No, I'm not gonna hurt you,” Womack said, unaware Cooke was only teasing.
The issue of players getting paid isn't black and white. Like the NCAA, the Olympics exist because of the sacrifices made by the athletes, so it's not crazy to think the participants should be compensated.

The future of the nearby neighborhood is less certain. Many of the homes were seized during the Cultural Revolution and their former owners banished or forced to share their space. A woman whose family had owned one of the compounds since the 1930s very unhappily recounted the time when 54 people shared a property that's now home to nine. After the Cultural Revolution, some people regained at least partial ownership of their property; others still pay rent to the state.
"Big picture, there's really significant movement in a very short amount of time, which I think a lot of folks felt wasn't possible," Duncan said. But he doesn't expect overnight success: "This is really, really hard work; there's a reason the country took a pass on this for a couple of decades."
The settlement came in the midst of a trial that delved into their finances and personal lives.

Her body has not been found. Defense attorneys argued that intense news coverage would prejudice jurors there. The trial is set at the Clay County Courthouse in Liberty on June 13.
It seemed to work for a while. Gingrich plodded along with a proudly nontraditional campaign and strong debate performances. The showings helped him win in South Carolina—one of only two states he would win—but were insufficient to stave off Romney's spending and organization in Florida. After Gingrich's stinging January loss there, the always high-spending campaign seemed to sputter along while amassing enormous debt.

NV Bruno Paillard Rosé Brut Premiere Cuvee Champagne ($90, 12%): Paillard is a recent name in Champagne, launching his label in 1981, but his stylish wines - and insistence on disgorgement dates - have quickly made him a formidable presence. Mostly Pinot Noir and made in an aromatically subtle and polished style, with rich flavors of puff pastry, peach, lemon and strawberry, plus a true tannic side that emerges in the glass. Disgorged December 2010. (Importer: Vintus)

It seems McDreamy, a.k.a. Patrick Dempsey, came to the rescue Tuesday afternoon of a teenage boy whose car had flipped several times into, TMZ reports, the Grey's Anatomy star's Malibu front yard. Apparently, the Mustang was totaled, but a crowbar-wielding Dempsey -- a passionate car-racing fan, by the way -- was able to pry the driver free. The boy got just a concussion, but also, clearly, a great story.

"The road is to be wide enough to accommodate a railroad and many concessions of the greatest value are held out. The country is exceedingly fertile and thickly populated. It will bring a vast commerce, I should think, to the port of Shanghai, the chief city on the gulf I have named and also give a great boom to Pekin, which is only a few miles distant from the great wall. Besides the wall is tangent to many great rivers as the Whang and Ho river, which is sometimes called the Yellow River.

There's also a refreshing lack of pretension, with wines served in Mason jars and a copy of the Oxford Companion to Wine behind the bar in case customers or staff members have questions.
So often, people take stands to prove their point or to win votes rather than to go in search of common ground for the common good. How do we move beyond the impasse? We must share space and time, share our hearts and values, and share our faults while looking for the good in others so that we move beyond the fault lines. In other words, in religion and politics, we must share our common humanity. Only in this way will we be able to navigate effectively the intersections of life.

The average year in the Gregorian system lasts exactly 365.2425 days, compared with the average year in the Dee system of a touch over 365.2424 days. The latter is closer to the actual time it takes the Earth to rotate around the sun, about 365.242 days, says Dr. Steel.
It's an odd predicament, because we travel in a surveillance society. Law enforcement agencies can place cameras in public areas and monitor our comings and goings, but when we try to take pictures, we're sometimes told that it's not allowed. Why the double standard? Should you stand up for your constitutional rights the next time you try to take a snapshot of your family at the airport and a stern-faced security agent tells you that it's illegal?
Obama also seemed to proudly state that border statistics (deportations, drugs confiscated) show marked improvement over prior statistics. Yet illegal immigrants cross into our country every day.

"Move the Senate bills, get them done, and then we can move on to the rest of this," Christie said. "The greatest sign of faith with the voters of New Jersey that the General Assembly could make is to pass these bills in the next week and a half and get them to my desk before I make the budget speech March 16. I will sign them and bring the signed copies and deliver them to the Senate President and the Speaker...There's no reason that can't be done and no reason it shouldn't be done."
-- The shutdown plan isn't certain to prevent panics. Regulators might hesitate to close a financial services company until the system already is in crisis. Still, regulators will be better able to defuse threats. And the system's health might be restored more quickly.

If a breeding population takes hold in Lake Michigan, biologists say, they could find their way around the tip of Michigan's Lower Peninsula to Lake Huron, then south to Lake Erie. How long the journey of more than 700 miles would take is anyone's guess.

Anecdotes abound. In 2002, an Arlington Republican went so far as to rent one room of a mobile home and claim it as his residence in the House district he eventually won. In 2006, a federal judge ruled Republicans couldn't replace embattled former U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay on the ballot for his Sugar Land congressional district, even though he'd since resigned and moved to Virginia. What mattered under the Constitution, the judge ruled, was where DeLay lived on Election Day, and it wasn't clear whether he'd return by then.

Springsteen and the band will spend most of this year on the road, rocking arenas and stadiums. And it’s a pretty good bet that — 40 years after the formation of the E Street Band — these will be long shows, celebratory shows. Wild and, in some ways, innocent shows that will remind you why you fell in love with rock ’n’ roll in the first place — and how these guys became legends.
Journalists lay out the rest of the story, and occasionally the film is overly dependent upon them, letting them go on at length. Some of the reporters clearly relish police jargon, often sounding more like movie cops than the real cops themselves.

No idea in American society is more pervasive than the notion that we all owe a debt of gratitude to the young men and women who have volunteered to fight our foreign wars. This nearly universal belief flows from a sense of collective guilt that the veterans of our previous Asian adventure in Vietnam were not welcomed home with appreciation for their sacrifices and were somehow held responsible for America's first losing war. This attitude was especially unfair since many of the participants in that conflict were draftees who had little choice about their service.

"But," informs Hayward, "ARPA-E's total budget was only $400 million in its first year  less than the Solyndra loan." I heard much the same from Ted Nordhaus, co-founder of the left-leaning Breakthrough Institute in Oakland. "When we first started, we thought you would spend $300 billion over 10 years and you could get a clean-energy economy," he said. "As we got clear about the technological problems, we got much more interested in innovation, as opposed to deploying what we currently have."

"Free-range" is a misnomer. It gives the consumer the feeling that the chickens are free to roam, when it really means that instead of living in cages all their lives, they have access to the outdoors, which could be concrete or dirt. Pasture-raised means just that. The chickens get to roam free amid rotated pastures, clean water and fresh air. That doesn't often happen. Sure, with free-range birds, there may be a blade or two of grass, but it's so full of nitrogen from overgrazing and manure that the birds won't eat it. In order to have edible pasture grass, the flock needs to be moved to a fresh section of grass every three days.

There was a torrent of compassion-speak: “Special care should be taken to ensure that standards are appropriate to the economic culture of urban, lower-income, and nontraditional consumers.” “Lack of credit history should not be seen as a negative factor.” Government having decided to dictate behavior that markets discouraged, the traditional relationship between borrowers and lenders was revised.

Steve Chapman repeats tired myths about the impact of raising the minimum wage. Contrary to his point about jobs disappearing, a 2011 study finds that during recessionary periods in the past 20 years, including when Congress raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour, increases did not cause employment declines.
