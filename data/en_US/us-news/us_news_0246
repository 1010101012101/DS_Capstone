Our passage took us south to the "roaring forties" to catch the trade winds. The 28 other people on board and I stood four-hour watches twice a day in every type of weather. We also steered the ship, handled the sails, stood bow watch, went aloft, polished brass, froze, saw whales and albatross, endured sea sickness from 20-foot swells, swam in water more than 6,500 feet deep, ate heartily and generally came to know, in a small way, what a 19th-century sailor had to endure.

It’s a sobering conclusion to a career that seemed destined to end as one of the best in Blazers history. The team acquired him in a trade during an active 2006 draft after he was selected with the sixth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Concerning what business could open at the Sappington Barn restaurant location in Crestwood, I think it would be great if the Blue Owl in Kimmswick would open one of their bakeries there. The ones that are already open are way south. I believe the closest bakery around is in Marlborough. I think they would do a phenomenal business in Crestwood with the draw of the Blue Owl name and bring in customers from surrounding areas.

The Situation is mad at Vinny Guadagnino for talking smack behind his back, and he gets sound advice to ignore him from Sammi Giancola, because she's so good at ignoring people who bother her. Pauly Delvecchio and Vinny meet up with three girls they like, and later Pauly D runs into Danielle, the Israeli girl he met a few days earlier. She throws him present -- a T-shirt that reads "I (Italian flag inside a Star of David) Jewish girls." He is appropriately freaked. She shows up against at the amusement park, and he blows her off. She calls the house that night, and Vinny does a pretty bad but still very funny impression of The Situation, trying to throw Danielle off Pauly D's trail.

Her father still casts a huge shadow, over his daughter's life as well as popular culture. The temptation is to dwell on the intersection of father and daughter; "Composed" is about Rosanne Cash's life, but if she had been the daughter of an accountant, this memoir probably wouldn't exist, at least not yet. The tension in the book comes from the little girl loving a dad who loved her back but who belonged to the world.

Most of the season featured Bryant scoring at a prolific rate, nailing game-winning shots and fighting through both wrist and concussion-related injuries. Yet, it hardly looked pretty. His 43% shooting percentage marks his lowest since the 2004-05 season. Bryant's game-winners all bailed the Lakers out of bad performances. Aside from Bynum's production, Bryant's scoring both glossed over the team's lacking supporting cast and played a factor in its delayed development.

Perhaps that's why state government also keeps local districts in a virtual vise when it comes to funding.

The proposed reductions in the bill are but a fraction of those called for in the broader, nonbinding budget plan that passed the House in March.

Only the epilogue is somewhat unsatisfying. Johnson details her years from 1997 to 2007 after leaving the convent and her attempts to resolve some of the emotional debris lingering from the departure. She married and says little of her life as a married writer near the end of the book; the last chapter feels strangely devoid of the central character of the other 505 pages: God. What became of that relationship? Johnson mentions that she rarely goes to church but doesn't elaborate on the state of her soul. In giving herself so completely to God, did this idealistic and compassionate young woman lose both her vocation and her faith?

Adam: I've been vocal about my lack of anticipation for this match in my Raw recaps. I am one of those who feel their match last year was overrated. I have no doubt they'll pull out all the stops this year and do their best to give the Attitude Era it's proper sendoff -- and I truly hope all three men blow my expectations out of the water -- but I'm expecting another slow-moving match filled with big spots and periods of rest while one competitor or the other is downed from said moves. I agree that Michaels will likely have a moral dilemma on his hand near the end of the match, but ultimately, this bout belongs to The Undertaker. I'm just left wondering where all three men head from here. Will Taker ride off into the sunset? Will Triple H leave the ring for the office full-time? The aftermath almost appeals more than the match itself.

The Spanish-style bread pudding was soggy and not worth the calories, but we did enjoy the whole prunes and candied Marcona almonds we plucked out, as well as the accompanying black olive caramel. The gateau Basque was an interesting version - its crust holding layers of cake and Meyer lemon curd topped with puffy meringue - but it was overbaked.

It strikes me this way: "Once upon a time there was an illegal slush fund in New Orleans, and only the players who hit late or went for the opponent's ACL were paid from it.

It's a terrible time for the Anne Arundel County Council to be engaged in a protracted standoff over the replacement of one of its members. The body's prestige was harmed enough by the circumstances that led to the removal of Democrat Daryl Jones, who is currently serving time in federal prison for failing to file income tax returns for several years. It has not been helped by the use of a racial slur by one of the council members during deliberation over Mr. Jones' replacement, and it has further been damaged by the seeming indifference of some members of the Republican majority about whether residents of the 1st District have any representation.

There isn't a lot of obvious youth in the program - certainly little on defense. Players are going to have to take a reduction in pay if the NFL's collective-bargaining agreement with the players association is ever resolved.

Certainly someone was going to pounce on Elie Saab's spring/summer 2012 couture collection, and it turned out to be newcomer Berenice Bejo of "The Artist," opting for one of his long-sleeved beaded-to-perfection gowns in mint green. Stunning, particularly with her red hair. Then there's Michelle Williams, who amped up her twee style in a stunning coral Louis Vuitton that ever so slightly referenced her standout Oscar look from 2006 in the pleating and saturated color but certainly didn't copy it. Our third top pick is Jessica Chastain, who has been fairly disappointing this awards season, but absolutely stepped up in an extravagantly embellished Alexander McQueen in black and gold.
The path goes on and on, and parts are quite steep. Wooden signs inform us of our progress, though they soon start to seem like taunts as we huff our way slowly toward la cima, the top: "9 km a la cima," or "4.5 km a la cima." We trudge along, pausing now and then to eat fresh raspberries off the vine or to admire the view. Soon, though, clouds begin rolling in from the west, and they are ominously dark.

Her loving spirit is what I want to pass on to my children and grandchildren."

Flare fittings are the last common offender. Here in Minnesota, soft copper gas tubing is allowed just about anywhere, but it takes a little more skill to properly install soft copper than other types of gas piping. For a flare fitting, copper tubing gets flared out at the end and connected with a flare nut. If this connection gets bent or isn't tight enough, it will leak. For the record, that nut pictured below isn't the right type of nut for a gas line... but it's what I had sitting in my parts drawer as I was writing this blog.

A recent study by the National Employment Law Project revealed that more than 90 percent of employers use criminal background checks in hiring decisions. They routinely deny someone with a record any chance to review the charges. Nonviolent youth offenders are eliminated, even though data suggest that once an early offender turns 26, many are less likely to engage in criminal activity than the general population. Even activists arrested in nonviolent protests find that their records can be used to disqualify them. Such arrests can also affect one's credit rating, and that, too, acts as a negative.

Another change to the law seems more relevant: To arrest Zimmerman, police need "probable cause" to conclude not simply that he killed someone but also that his use of force was unlawful.

Sweet Sue’s was back in business, Brio’s too, some new stores I didn’t even remember — nice ones, too — had their doors open as well. What, I wondered, was the big fuss all about?

The new measure, Senate Bill 829, gives cities until 2015 to repeal existing laws before they would lose state funding on all projects. It is unclear if that timeline would apply to San Diego if Proposition A is approved.

Statistics were thrown out left and right in support of the new policy. One in particular caught our attention.
Roosevelt was following in the footsteps of Herbert Hoover, whose Federal Farm Board sought to corner the world wheat market in 1929-30 and caused great havoc. By 1931, U.S. wheat exports had partially rebounded, but in 1933, the new Roosevelt administration considered the prices too low. It used price supports and massive wheat purchases to drive up American prices, and it intentionally let exports fall.
Then it felt … well, right exciting. Unfolding before us was another world, getting ready to transport us to a fantastical place. Although the addition to Islands of Adventure remains a work in progress — an army of construction workers hammers away — enough details are in place to give the village a sense of place already.
There is an argument that sound, not song, is the basic building block of popular music — that melody and lyric don’t matter as much as the feel, and the beat, and the reverberations of strings and speakers. The ATP festival, which began on Friday and ends tonight, made that argument with conviction, and no small amount of aggression. This was not an event for singalongs or dancing; it was an opportunity to get lost in the squall of overdriven electric guitars and computer beats. Call it avant-garde if you like, but there is primal joy to be had in making a racket — and Asbury Park was awash in clangor.
Creighton, losers of three straight, dropped out from 17th. Mississippi State fell out from 20th and Harvard from 25th.
Hmm. My bicycle has brakes, so I can stop. A rear-view mirror, so I can see what's coming up behind me. Flashing red lights on the rear, flashing white lights on the front, so I'm visible to drivers and pedestrians at night. I wear a helmet.

The business lobby was split on the Senate action, reflecting the different stakes for constituent businesses. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the Senate bill "is counterproductive, does little to lower the cost of health care, and it is not reform. It implements crippling new taxes, and hurts our ability to create jobs at the worst possible time for the economy."

Note: This casserole, from Luna Maya, a Bolivian-Mexican restaurant in Norfolk, Va., is adapted from "The World in a Skillet." Its international flavor evokes the New South, but cooked in the traditional Southern skillet. Luna Maya calls for a baking pan to finish the dish, but we used the same 12-inch cast-iron skillet throughout.
Perhaps the message is that justice must be done, it is good to bring Osama Bin Laden to death and rid the world of a bit of evil, but at the same time perhaps we must not separate ourselves mentally from him, we must realize he is "our

Ever since then, San Francisco leaders have reflexively refused to discuss Hetch Hetchy restoration, and the Chronicle, sadly, has chosen to toe the line of the city's power brokers.
I wanted ethnic diversity and gender diversity. I found that over half of the patients we approached wanted to have their story told. Those stories, in one way or another, involve people whose lives had fallen apart quite a bit before the state steps in -- and we step in with a heavy boot.
Gibbs, McNeeley and Becker collected plaques and proclamations thanking them for their roles in Alisa's safe return to her family. "I hope you brought a big enough car," Fenton Mayor Dennis Hancock said as accolades piled up.

The choice of the NBCF as beneficiary of the preview night was an easy one. Oswald’s mother, who lives in California, received a breast cancer diagnosis in July of 2010. “I didn’t want to lose my mom,” Oswald says. “I didn’t want to be an orphan.”

"It doesn't mean it's too late," he said. "We didn't have to spend a whole lot of money to sell tickets last year. Every time you guys wrote a story – good, bad or indifferent – we sold more tickets. There's no reason to believe this year's tickets wouldn't sell well."
Portlanders in particularly steep parts of town pay more for garbage pickup. Homeowners on narrow West Hills side roads receive annual warnings that the city will not take extra steps to clear their streets of snow and ice. Why shouldn't those of us lucky enough to live in older neighborhoods with big, beautiful trees pay the cost of clearing them from the road if we're not willing to do it ourselves? At the very least, that's a debate in which the entire city should have participated.
First, the Ducks need sprinter Amber Purvis to make a quick return to health. She is a potential factor in the 100, 200 and both relays, but hasn't run recently with what is said to be a "tweaked back."
The reality is, 20 percent of baby boomers are childless, with no offspring to support them or care for them in their older years. And even if a couple's assets stretch enough to cover the expenses of one spouse's care, what happens if the surviving spouse needs long-term assistance later?
"It's going to be a case of supply and demand, and right now, there's not a supply. It's a whole lot easier to find pitching these days than impact players. What that price is, who knows?"
One member of the mosque, however, Abdur Rahman, called the surveillance effort offensive. "It's crazy," Rahman said as the mosque's amplified call to prayer sounded outside. "It's a form of stereotyping. It's stupid."
In Mexico, the big story is, quite simply, that we have become a middle-class country. This is the result of macroeconomic stability, innovative social programs and open borders to trade. The steady growth of an empowered and demanding middle class constitutes the best grounds for optimism in my country's future.
It was the 20th attack this year in which Afghan soldiers or insurgents disguised in military uniforms have turned their weapons on foreign troops. The incidents have raised the level of mistrust between the U.S.-led coalition and their Afghan partners and raised questions about the readiness of local forces to take over from NATO ahead of a 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of foreign combat troops.

These days, it feels as though the staff is filing more reports of victories - the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," promising developments toward an AIDS vaccine, and increasing numbers of states allowing gay couples to marry. Whereas the BAR used to be the only place to find major coverage of the Gay Pride Parade, now it's reprinted, tweeted and blogged everywhere, to almost every major city in the world.

Romney has so far tinkered stylistically with the approach that came up short in the 2008 campaign. He's kept the tailored suits and fancy ties in the closet, while politicking in open-necked shirts and low-rise Levi's slim jeans. He's even sent out, via Twitter, photographic evidence that his perfectly coifed hair sometimes gets mussed.
"There was vampire fiction before Stoker, and maybe other people would have picked up on that, but he truly set off the boom," said Elizabeth E. Fuller, a librarian at Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum & Library, the resting place for Stoker's research notes and outlines for "Dracula."
A police statement released Sunday afternoon said Brown and an unidentified woman began arguing while riding in a car following a pre-Grammy party where they were spotted together Saturday night. The fight escalated when they got out of the car in the ritzy Hancock Park neighborhood, the report said, and Brown was gone by the time officers arrived.
You don't mention the impact of your infidelity and your marital issues on your children; do not diminish how life-changing this is for them. And don't forget how powerless they are to the capricious behavior of their parents. Surely you can give them a commitment of six more months to try to repair your marriage.
The Lil Cardinals Reggie Fong made a great scoop and throw to first in the top of the first. DeCot and R Jack both had fantastic hits up the middle, and Veimoen roped one down the third baseline. Murphy showed a lot of hustle rounding the bases. Roman Fong, Slade Doran, and Bordessa had solid hits in the bottom of the inning. Selli showed off his athleticism making two great stops, and Fazio looked like a pro catching a one-hopper and throwing it to first in the top of the second. Power-hitter D Jack pulled one to left field. Balmy and Levie had awesome hits in the bottom of the second. Outstanding overall play by Brady Nemes, Liam Noyes, Vincent Smith and Alex Snowden. Brady efficiently covered 1st base, while Liam protected the pitcher's mound. Vincent prevented balls from reaching the outfield at 3rd base and Alex ran for every ball hit. Their defense was supplemented by Phillip Engstrom at pitcher. Andrew Smith in the infield and Nick Abreu at first base were eager to chase down balls. Solid hits by Braxton Nemes and Aaron McCoy. Caleb Kendall-Protacio and Lilyanna Carpenter finished it off with impressive at bats.

The Hudson location is not a full 2.0. It is smaller, with 2,800 square feet and 150-seat capacity, rather than the 4,000-square-foot, 170-seat prototype, so it doesn't have the space for a meeting room. While this restaurant does offer takeout, the larger prototype has a designated takeout area in the front. The larger locations also have booths with inset TVs.

"Obviously, a lot of people are kind of talking us down and telling us what we can't do," Magic power forward Ryan Anderson said. "And I think that that's really fueling us. It is nice to start with a clean slate. I just think that we play really well with this group."
From the entrance to Judy's, low-slung, comfy chairs at an intimate, table-height bar beckoned, and a few seats had just become available as we arrived. The bar surface was outfitted with touchscreen gaming machines and, in true casino form, a dusting of cigarette ash. More cozy seating areas accented with sequined velvet curtains set the mood of a flashy nightclub.

As an example, Gundlach Bundschu Winery is today a small family business in Sonoma, making 40,000 cases of wine per year. But before the quake, Gundlach Bundschu was based in San Francisco, had an office in New York and cranked out 250,000 cases per year, much of it fortified wine.
We made Fairport, a charming canal village, just in time for cocktails in the aft cockpit and an excellent dinner at Joey B's: rack of lamb with scalloped potatoes for some, veal medallions or sea scallops in a Parmesan cream sauce for others, eaten on a deck overlooking the canal. Like all the villages where we tied up, Fairport has amenities for boaters, in this case water, electric hook-ups, showers and toilets. There was an $11 dockage fee, but the facilities were complimentary elsewhere.

"I don't know why," Russell said, "but knowing 'Hitch' has made it a bit easier for me to jump into the situation. But I don't know... I've come here and they've given me a fair chance and it's my time to go out there and prove I can be a regular and play big minutes."

Even better, it will vex foodies that this family-owned business uses St. Louis-style spare ribs and not baby backs, and also grills them directly over the coals.

"And now it's getting some well-deserved TLC."
A: Several sources confirmed the idea that Tressel's departure was a resignation in name only. The accumulation of accusations, potential violations and generally negative coverage of Ohio State apparently became too much for at least some members of the OSU Board of Trustees. Sports Illustrated's story Monday night alleged that as many as 28 players over eight years were involved with trading memorabilia for tattoos. That may have affected the timetable, though Tressel was also on vacation and returned only Sunday night. He immediately met with AD Gene Smith, and then told his team of his resignation Monday morning.
Bruno said then she was seeking a review by a child psychologist, Dr. Joseph Gentry, but asked the school to do its own behavioral analysis first. She said the school staff refused, asking for Gentry's assessment.

For example, the bulk of cash generated by the vacation cruise industry flows directly to Carnival Corp. (CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL), Slaughter said.
