I stayed at the Inn on Ferry Street, a bed-and-breakfast in a cluster of Victorian homes off Woodward Avenue.

I guess this is where I'm supposed to thank everybody and thanks are certainly due. For your confidence and forthright response to my many probing questions; for your hospitality in welcoming this odd stranger into your lives and homes; but most especially for the generous manner in which you received my self-indulgent ramblings in this jaundiced-eyed column.

Though clearly they missed Kovalchuk for long stretches. In his third season with the Devils, Kovalchuk has three goals in eight playoff games and remains day to day. He walked with a pad on his back after Sunday’s 4-3 overtime, Game 1 loss, and walked around the locker room Monday at practice in Newark quite gingerly.

“People want to divide filmmakers into two piles,” Cameron complains. “There are the humanist, actor-oriented filmmakers, like John Cassavetes, or the tech filmmakers who are just focused on spectacle, like Roland Emmerich. And they always put me in the tech pile. But the way I feel, the way I work, is that you should be both. We’ve transformed our entire social landscape through technology, yet we’re these chemical, highly emotional beings . . . And we still love stories. Stories that take you on a voyage, that unfold linearly, that let you react to this new place and then lay in the mysteries and mythic elements.”

A senior advisor to one of the 2008 Democratic contenders was equally emphatic. "I think the more they can be de-legitimized the better," the advisor said.

This is not the first time that candidates have bragged of their business success, only to have their records -- with lawsuits, sour deals, angry or spurned partners or clients -- turn into fodder in the debate.

There is really only one reason "Albert Nobbs" was made into a movie, and that reason is Glenn Close.

Since the new law passed, the state Board of Education has received waiver requests from Kent and Wicomico counties. Officials in Kent argue that they deserve a waiver because the economic downturn has affected it more than other counties, and they say that it would be untenable to raise taxes enough to pay for the additional amount they are required to fund under the law. They also claim that the schools would not be hurt by the county's failure to meet the full maintenance of effort amount, though the superintendent there, Barbara Wheeler, strongly disputes that notion.

In his audiotapes to the world released over the years, bin Laden was known for his florid rhetoric and highly elevated vocabulary, obscure even to some Arabic speakers. But there is almost none of that in the private messages to associates. Bin Laden is businesslike and to the point, whether it's discussing travel arrangements for his sons, advising Algerian militants to plant tamarind and acacia trees in their desert hideouts (they're cheap, don't need much water, and can hide you from drones), or telling his lieutenants to try to shoot down President Barack Obama's plane on a visit to Afghanistan.

Still, I must whip Andora Gardens, my name for my yard, into shape. I've decided to start by weeding. I'll pop out and weed a bit whenever the rain stops and the temperature is above 40 degrees. I can't damage the soil by weeding and it will give me an up-close look at the garden, as well as making me feel better.

On one visit our overly friendly waiter who, like many of his compatriots working the floor, has years of experience from other restaurants, told us how Chiarello created a tumbler that spins and tenderizes the octopus for one of the signature dishes, a marvelous blend of the wood-grilled seafood draped over olive oil-braised potatoes, piquant pickled red onions and salsa verde ($13). On another visit, the waiter pointed out that the polenta in a signature appetizer came from heirloom seeds from Venice. The fantasy fuels the imagination, but in reality the Polenta Under Glass ($12) didn't work all that well. It has a clever presentation, served in a jar topped with mushrooms and a balsamic game sauce. The polenta has an incredible texture and flavor, but the balsamic syrup that covers the top mutes the great qualities of the ingredients. Balsamic also rendered the rabbit sugo with garganelli ($19) too intense and left a syrupy sweetness on the aftertaste.

"Playing against teams like this _ playing the best basketball in the NBA -- we have to be clicking on all cylinders. We can't have any mistakes. We've got to look like a seasoned veteran team. We showed our youth at times. We made mistakes. That's what we can learn from and try to go forward.''

In August 2008, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which issues recommendations that are generally followed by Medicare and many insurers, said that men over the age of 75 should not receive the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, which measures blood levels of a protein secreted by the prostate gland. In younger men, elevated levels are usually a sign that a biopsy needs to be performed. But because most prostate cancers are very slow growing -- 80% of men over the age of 80 have them with no apparent harm -- such testing is not advisable in older men. The task force noted that "there is moderate or high certainty the service has no net benefit or that the harm outweighs the benefits." Side effects from treatment of a prostate tumor can include incontinence, impotence, rectal bleeding and many other complications.

French fries (frites) are an integral component of steak frites ($19.95), so it’s a disappointment when they’re not all they could be. The ones on my plate tasted disturbingly like frozen, lacking crispness as well as salt. Hand-cut fries would be more appropriate here and should be easy enough for a commercial kitchen to manage.
Barnes & Noble and Microsoft are teaming up to try to make a bigger mark in the booming digital book market.

This isn't the first time four-footed protein and the stuff that gets brined, cured and processed (sausage, ham and most lunch meats fall into this category) have been linked with big health risks like heart disease, diabetes, cancer and all-round bigger odds for a sooner-rather-than-later Big Exit. In 2009, we let you in on earlier evidence that a burger a day boosts risk for fatal heart disease and cancer by up to 30 percent. This new report, from Harvard, is notable because it followed more than 120,000 men and women for 20 years, tracking their diets and their health. But "no meat' doesn't mean you have to give up all the things that make beef, bologna and brats so darned tempting. Here's how to step away from the four-legged creatures -- and keep big flavor, super-size satisfaction, and something worth sliding into your next burger bun. Grill something new. Fire up your grill and lay out beefy-tasting veggie -- yes, veggie -- burgers. We're big fans of many types with flavors from spicy to barbecue to classic. Dr. Mike recently had a veggie burger "taste-off" of more than 20 different brands at his house. Love hot dogs? Here's a great alternative. Look for low-fat, low-sodium tofu or turkey dogs; pair with sauerkraut on a 100 percent whole-wheat bun, top with a thin ribbon of yellow mustard (the yellow contains brain-healing turmeric) and you're ready for great summer eating!

It's the water. Serious tea drinkers who want to brew their leaves at a specific temperature may want to try the Zojirushi Hybrid Water Boiler and Warmer ($184.95 at Target and chefscorner.com).

Vitaly: There are plenty of sustainable items we can explore from around the world. I don't know if we would ship directly, but there's a monopoly of seafood companies in Portland, and unfortunately they are not the best if you compare the quality of what else is out there.

So getting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds into college is important. But Pell Grants are only a starting point. The investment in student aid starts paying dividends to the student, and to our economy and society, when he or she graduates and enters the work force. Besides admitting Pell students, high-performing colleges and universities need to focus on keeping those students in school and supporting them so that they can fulfill their potential.

It would be fatuous to say it is better to miss free throws than to make them. Still, the best Cavaliers team before LeBron James -- the only one to win more than one playoff series in one spring, you knew 'em as Mark, Brad, Larry and Hot Rod, the 1991-92 Cavs -- shot 80.5 percent as a team. They were dispatched nonetheless in the conference finals by the Bulls, who had Michael Jordan.

"Get me a horse," he said.
Obama's proposal comes after two years of unsuccessfully pushing cap-and-trade legislation, which supporters concede has no chance of getting through Congress now that the GOP controls the House. Under the cap-and-trade system -- aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide blamed for global warming -- the government would place a limit on pollution and allow companies to buy and sell pollution permits under that ceiling. Companies that reduce their emissions could then cheaply sell their unused credits to those that cannot afford the costs of emission controls.
"It's Thursday," Mickelson said when asked which day this week has been most important to this run. "Because at some point on this golf course, I'm going to get hot, make birdies, maybe an eagle here or there. At some point, I'm going to get on the leaderboard.

Congress chose the "minimum coverage" method to reach the health care access goal because it decided it was more politically viable and efficient. It chose a plan where private companies, rather than the government, provide the insurance, and where people have a lot of choice about which type of plan they get.
These all work as so many tasty bonbons, but "Follies" demands more: a real vision of theater.
And some commentators have berated the church for missing an opportunity to stand together with the poor and marginalized.

Interim coach Mike Woodson has been patient with Stoudemire's situation after the Knicks veteran cut himself by slapping a glass fire extinguisher door following the team's Game 2 loss in Miami. Woodson has insisted that this will be a doctor's decision, and since the cut was apparently close to a nerve, there is naturally going to be some caution about throwing him back on the court for Game 4, particularly with the Knicks trailing 3-0.

Cable television still regularly runs "Lorenzo's Oil," which depicts how Odone discovered that patients with ALD could benefit from a derivative of olive oil and rapeseed oil.

While the opposition's entry into the bicameral legislature is highly symbolic, the new lawmakers will have little power. A couple dozen lawmakers from smaller opposition parties also sit in the assembly, but the vast majority of seats are held by the military-backed ruling party and the army, which is allotted 25 percent of them. Changes to the constitution require a 75 percent majority, meaning that doing so is all but impossible without military approval.

Ah, that would be me and my family she is referring to. Freebie media tickets in hand, stumbling goggle-eyed past truth and beauty we neither created nor could ever pay for. Sorry about that, Chicago. Our fault, for being art world freeloaders, parasites, at least on purely financial scale. But art breaks the bonds of the money that births it. You might just as well say that the tourists in Rome, gaping, heads tossed back, in the Sistine Chapel don't belong, because they aren't Pope Julius II, the man who commissioned Michelangelo's vast ceiling early in the 16th century.

If a business owner walked into his bank and told the loan officer he was bleeding red ink month after month, facing imminent collapse without an infusion of cash to cover his monthly operating expenses and that demand for his products was in free fall with no bottom in sight, would the bank make the loan?

What high school sports mean to me: I love high school sports. You're always with a different group of people. But the biggest thing I've learned is the leadership. As a freshman, you're down low and meek. As you move up, you become a senior and get into a huge leadership role just because you've been there for the past four years.

Partly as a result of this enduring fiasco, we are also immersed in an almost surreal community discussion about whether Denver is trying to "criminalize" homelessness by considering the sort of camping ban on streets and sidewalks that exists in such hotbeds of reactionary sentiment as Boulder.

After Sept. 11, President George W. Bush and countless politicians and commentators told us, "Islam is a religion of peace." One of the subtexts of this assertion was that "Muslims are just like us.

For most stars, Chicago is out of sight, out of mind, but there are exceptions. Steppenwolf ensemble member John Mahoney kept his home in Oak Park throughout the run of "Frasier" and has been working in local theater steadily ever since. William Petersen of "CSI" fame maintains a home here and occasionally performs around town. Every so often, David Schwimmer directs a play at Lookingglass.

“Trenton is telling us the number of admissions is decreasing,” Koch said. “That’s good. We work toward that.
