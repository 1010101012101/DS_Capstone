Impressive and not because they blew out an opponent by more than 20 for the first time since Dec. 23. Seton Hall's stature as a top-25 team wouldn't be measured by how much it beats its opponents, but by how sturdy the Pirates were. And — with the exception of one span there in the second half — this was about as solid of a performance as they come.

This looked like a team that knew that being ranked was the first part of the process. They flexed their offensive muscle, defensive muscle and got contributions from all over the place. These are the games that ranked teams are supposed to win easy and Seton Hall did just that.

The legislation also would reach into areas unrelated to the financial crisis, such as the relationship between corporations' shareholders and their boards, and the role of investors in start-up businesses.

"From the time I came into this league, I made a decision that no matter what happens, you're gonna have to carry me off the field to stop me from trying to make it," Moore said. "It's still a work in progress, but like I said, it's an honor to even be standing here talking about this today."

I like my creature comforts, and frankly her descriptions of some of the places she's traveled to around the area she teaches in did not exactly conjure up comfy surroundings. Like so many other subjects on which I've been proven wrong, however, our recent trip was surprisingly safe and comfortable, with a few exceptions.
It’s not isolated, folks.

Remembers Egon, "His assistant drove us to a lot he owned a couple miles away, which consisted of a large hill full of spring flowers and a number of giant oak trees. When we returned, Mr. Armstrong told us that if we bought that lot, he would build us a house on it. We bought the lot that very day for $6,000."
But some people go too far in searching for tax advantages. Perhaps they take a deduction that they aren't eligible for or claim a few extra dollars on a charitable donation. If the IRS begins to suspect that a tax return isn't entirely truthful, the filer might be in for an audit.
Like the bust area, toes are generally seen as an erotic zone (toe cleavage anyone?), and the peep toe on a shoe is like a low-cut blouse that exposes cleavage. "There seems to be a lot of circumstantial evidence that people think of feet as a smaller version of the body," says Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "The term 'toe cleavage' is related to breasts, and peep toe, as its name indicates, is like a type of peep show - a way of exposing part of yourself."
Tuesday and Wednesday, the hottest days of the week, the thermometer could crack the 100-degree mark, Kline said. As for any rain to help soak lawns and flower gardens, don’t expect that until next weekend.

They'd been fighting intermittently for weeks about each other's infidelities, and he decided to press the issue that night. What he wound up doing, by his own admission to police, was kicking in her door as she screamed at him. He wrestled with her, shook her, restrained her, then threw her on her bed and left, taking her laptop.
U.S. Judge Rebecca Beach Smith ruled in federal court in Norfolk, Va., that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s proposed generic version of Viagra would infringe a Pfizer patent for the drug, and that the patent is valid and enforceable.
"I think what I continue to say to them is, we have to fully support Lotus," said Bernard, who first heard the concerns three weeks ago at the Barber Motorsports Park race.
Some are worried because Concord's building, constructed in 1936, is one of the oldest in the district. Concord was not remodeled as extensively as other older facilities after taxpayers passed a $229.6 million capital bond in 2006.
Courtesy of Russia, Iran’s first nuclear plant is also online now, surging watts to the country’s electrical grid. Tehran claims the Bushehr reactor is for power only, but many see a second use for the facility. At some point, the 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant -- perhaps the first of many -- could help Iran build a plutonium-based bomb, quickly pumping up the muscle of a nuclear arsenal.
But the flip side of that probability is the likelihood that some or many of them had been through drug treatment before, too, without discernible result.
But even before that $194 million project is complete, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and shipping industry officials said they are keen to pursue federal money to rehab the jetties that shield the channel at the mouth of the river. That could cost $400 million to $500 million.

Republicans argue that a college degree won't fix the student's legal status and they'll have trouble finding jobs. Republican Rep. Brian DelGrosso, who chairs the committee that rejected the bill, said he understands the argument from supporters that the current system leaves illegal immigrant students hopeless. But the bill would set up families for a financial hardship later, he said.
But this canvas is heavily blighted, too. Waist-high grass fills the abandoned lot across the street. The few nearby buildings being actively used include a junkyard, an auto shop, a church and a grocery store with a roof encircled in barbed wire. Detroit's skyline towers in the distance.
Applicants are being told they will only have jobs for as little as four years at a time, after which they will have to re-apply. That means competing with younger, fresher faces — a requirement that has never been made before in the 33-year history of casino gambling in Atlantic City.

Swetland, a professor of Christian ethics at Mount St. Mary’s University in Maryland, is the only remaining finalist to replace Monsignor Robert Sheeran when he steps down as Seton Hall’s president at the end of the month. Though the faculty resolution does not mention Swetland by name, it eludes to criticism that he lacks the experience to lead the state’s largest Catholic university.
Mrs. Weiskopf is survived by her two children, Marta and Doug, and her two grandchildren, Alder and Virginia.
2. Heat a sauté pan over medium-high heat and brush with oil. Sear salmon until golden, about 3 minutes, then flip and sear other side. Salmon will be medium-rare; let stand for 2 to 4 minutes before serving or, if you prefer your salmon more fully cooked, flip again and cook each side an additional 1 to 2 minutes.
Around this same time, he was making his mark in the world of graffiti art.

Jennifer Lopez is taking her children on tour.
According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, injuries from table saw usage cost over $35,000 per injury or more than $2.36 billion per year. The CPSC recently voted to consider whether a safety standard is needed to address injuries associated with table saws, but they have been debating this for years. It is clear California needs to exercise some leadership on this issue.
"I'm a pretty good kicker, and eventually I'm going to get back in my swing."
At this venerable midtown destination for steaks and martinis, traditionalists order a vodka martini, dirty, then prattle on about the political power players sitting nearby. They've entered via the back doors, through the kitchen, and nestled in a red-leather tuck-and-roll booth. But Durant's doesn't hide behind flair-tending histrionics and fancy mixers. It makes powerful drinks that are comforting in their familiarity, such as the Manhattan. Drinking the smoky, rich, icy dark mix of bourbon, bitters and sweet vermouth garnished with a single cherry, feels right in a place where the servers wear tuxedos and the wallpaper is flocked.
“I’m surprised the amount of times I play the puck that I don’t get called for it more,” Carruth said. “They weren’t pressuring me and I lackadaisically threw it to (William) Wrenn and then looked at where I passed it and I was right outside the corner.
The Internet and social media played a pivotal role in the pro-democracy uprisings of last year's Arab Spring, which led to the toppling of repressive regimes in Egypt, Libya and other countries.

He said the high suicide numbers in the Minnesota Guard need to be viewed in context -- the state has higher rates of suicide as a whole, particularly in northern Minnesota.
Arizona coach Sean Miller points out that his team has gone up against Gonzaga and its very talented frontcourt and just got through dealing with big Josh Smith and UCLA. So it’s not like the Wildcats are going to be looking up slack-jawed at 6-10 Angus Brandt, 6-10 Eric Moreland and 6-8 Devon Collier.
Playing in Class AA for the first time, Mount stunned two-time defending city champion Christ the King in the intersectional quarterfinals to advance to its first-ever semifinals at the highest classification.

Fisher, the attorney, doesn't think so. The lesson for employers, he says, is not that the government can control where you make an investment. Rather, it's that there are times when you should keep your mouth shut.
President William Taft was to sign the proclamation at 8 (Arizona time) that morning, followed by the inauguration of Gov. George W.P. Hunt, who insisted he would walk from Seventh Avenue along Washington to the Capitol, rather than be driven in his "luxurious benzine buggy," a rather expensive horseless carriage that often drew criticism from the populace.
Such affection is commonplace around the world, yet it seems to be lost on much of the West. Ladakh has shown me and many of my students that, while sometimes it's enough just to be there for a friend, a simple touch of the arm or a head on the shoulder can remind us how friendship should feel.
“The road repair should take about 60 days,” according to Benjamin H. Laury, deputy freeholder director and chairman of the Public Works Committee.
“I come here all the time,” he says. “Pattie sets them (the puzzles) up for me. I work on it, Pattie works on it, John works on it.” Pattie is the eponymous owner of the cafe and John, one of her employees.
"I wore it every game when I came back last year," said Choo. "I've only worn it against lefties this year, but I might start wearing it all the time."
Another misconception is that hypnosis works only on some people. Imbus says everyone can be hypnotized, but some of us are more willing than others to try it out. Typically, 75 percent of the 30 audience volunteers on stage will fall into a hypnotic trance. Another misconception is that some people will stay trapped in a hypotonic state forever.

He’ll do it in a time when the best players get one year to make an impact on the college level, and for many of them, it feels like a perfunctory stop. A Wildcat today. A Bobcat (and a millionaire) Monday.
But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who has been at the center of the immigration firestorm since signing Senate Bill 1070 into law on Friday, made it clear Tuesday night that she doesn't think the federal government has upheld its responsibilities when it comes to border security.
Next, we met up with three of Lana's friends and their moms at Frogg's Bounce House. Very cool. No shoes allowed ... unless you are visiting the restroom, and then you'll get either pink or blue Crocs to wear.

A: One indication of its success was (the reaction to) the death of Dorothy. I'm doing an autopsy on Dorothy at 6 a.m. -- it was a very emotional time for us -- and I started hearing on the radio that someone was at the front gate. And awhile later I heard somebody else was at the gate, and then somebody else, and I ignored it for a while. But when I finished the autopsy, I said, "Who's at the gate?" And the guard said, "The local population." It was people who'd walked from villages more than 5 kilometers away, including the chief, who, when I first came there, argued with me about (bush meat). They all came and were very emotional at Dorothy's funeral.
Among the changes, first reported by Politico: laying off one-third of the staff and reducing Gingrich's schedule. Campaign manager Michael Krull, a friend of Gingrich's wife, Callista, has been replaced by longtime Gingrich aide Vince Haley. DeSantis declined to identify other staffers who had been let go but said more than 20 remained, including himself, Haley and spokesman R.C. Hammond.
I’m guessing I’m not the only working parent who would feel chastised by the study authors for putting my kid in a situation in which he’s unlikely (statistically at least) to get his recommended hour of daily exercise. But the kids who play outside with their parents every day may not be getting a full hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise either. The study makes no attempt to measure the total minutes of outdoor playtime with parents, only the frequency of these outings. Is 30 minutes of playtime in the sandbox with Dad really worth more (from an exercise standpoint) than 45 minutes of tag with friends at school? I doubt it.
No superstitions, but I do have a specific route I must take to get to the stadium. Coming from an hour away, there are ample ways to get to the stadium, but I drive a very convoluted course to arrive there. The limited times I've been late and gone a different way, or not parked in the same lot, we've either gotten smashed, or injured. I do it for the team.
Dr. Danforth and Ms. Freeman are trusted figures who are familiar with the social, financial, academic and administrative challenges facing St. Louis Public Schools.
But any concern that Fey, like so many before her, has been ruined by fame is quickly dispelled by "Bossypants," a book that reminds you why Fey has succeeded where so many have failed — because she is precise, professional and hilarious.
Albert Cernadas Sr., who served as both executive vice president of the International Longshoremen’s Association and president of ILA Local 1235 in Newark, was accused of shaking down his members under threats of violence, in what was described as a long-running racketeering operation tied to the Genovese organized crime family.
Start down that slippery slope, and in no time at all Michigan voters would be demanding the right to know whenever anyone spent money to influence anyone on the public payroll. So ordinary citizens would know to the penny how much their elected representatives charge to sell them out -- and that knowledge would likely do for public confidence in state government what a more sophisticated understanding of pink slime has done for sales of ground beef.
"In our first full year as a public company, we grew the top and bottom lines, advanced our global market share and made strategic investments in our brands around the world," GM Chairman and Chief Executive Dan Akerson said in a written statement. "We will build on these results as we bring more new cars, crossovers and trucks to market, and make GM a far more efficient global team."
Gross uses various genres, from memoirs to poetry collections to non-fiction stories. Some address medical issues directly, while others, like the recent "Death in Venice," provide insight into broader topics such as how people who are dying experience their last moments and how caregivers can look past their personal feelings when dealing with patients.
Chrysler is almost a nonentity, but Fiat, its majority owner, has built its first plant, which could eventually add Jeep production.
The Titan II seems to have taken most of its design ideas from the signature burgers at Carl's Jr. Whatever McDonalds or Wendys or Burger King is selling, give ‘em more, more more. Seven patties. A half a pound each! Two . . . no, three layers of bacon! Four kinds of cheese! And a military grade of hot peppers that's only recently been de-classified for civilian use.
Ostensibly, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's languid drama takes us on a long journey through the endless empty fields of Anatolia in Turkey, searching for a dead body. A three-car caravan of law officials -- cramped, grumpy, bored, sucking on cigarettes -- runs deep into the night and early morning, led by the less-than-informative murder suspect who is trying to remember where he buried his victim.
PNCA's huge, complex agenda requires both maintenance and increased physical and financial resources. How can Manley keep the college ahead of an economy that has derailed the short-term dreams of many nonprofits?
But was not Kerry's selection of Edwards at the very least as irresponsible as McCain's selection of Palin?
"It was like a postapocalyptic world," Gonzalez said.
However, after 40 people were evacuated from the building around 9:30 p.m. Friday, American Red Cross volunteers who aided them were told by authorities that the fumes were caused by an acid leak, Red Cross spokesman William Kahn said.

A Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated on Saturday at 10 a.m. at St. Aloysius Church, 691 West Side Ave.
2. Twice the Marlins intentionally walked Lance Berkman to face David Freese on Wednesday. The Cardinals third baseman knows it's going to take a lot more than October to change that approach. Freese had three hits and two RBIs on opening night, and that put him in rare MVP company. Freese, the World Series MVP in 2011, is only the second World Series MVP to have three hits and two RBIs on the next opening day. The previous one, according to The Elias Sports Bureau, was Pete Rose, who did it in 1976 after winning the MVP in the 1975 World Series.
Blocker was waiting for a relative alongside a Jeep in the parking lot when he was approached by a gunman who fired several shots at him in what police characterized as a case of mistaken identity.

Testimony from the victim and the defendant painted different versions of what happened early that July morning.
So, forgive me if I don't go crazy at the news that Olbermann is out at a national cable channel that draws fewer viewers in prime time than most local stations draw for their 11 p.m. newscasts in Top 20 markets.
The National Weather Service is predicting at least 6 inches of snowfall for most sections of the state, with totals reaching 10 inches for the northern and eastern edges. The bulk of New Jersey residents appear poised to see around 8 inches of snow between 7 p.m. tonight and Wednesday morning, with the storm leaving an inch per hour during its peak.
The foundation said it does not oppose politicians taking part in religious services, but that Perry crossed a line by initiating the event, using his position as governor to endorse and promote it and by using his official website to link to the organizer's website. The plaintiffs also contend that Perry's use of Texas' official state seal to endorse the event and his plans to issue an official proclamation violate the Constitution.

Halloran had told police that Ouimet was tossing the gun between his hands when the gun fired, while Ouimet said he was dancing to music and went to change a radio station when the gun went off. Holland was struck in the abdomen. He died at a hospital in Farmington about an hour later.
She could not immediately produce the winning ticket but said she would contact lottery officials with it on Monday. As of Monday evening, lottery officials said they had heard from no winner and dismissed Wilson's story as likely nothing more than unsubstantiated gossip.
"I put ads in the paper," Altamura said. "I had the manager that opened up the theater in 1937 draw what it looked like. Then I had an usher who was here draw a picture. I had five, six people all do the same and none of them looked the same." Finally, he said, a couple brought an album into the Napa Historical Society that had the shot they needed.
His decision to resign after 10 years on the job was not completely unexpected by church watchers. His predecessor, George Carey, served for 11 years.
Juarez's vehicle crashed into the wall of an automotive business. He was pronounced dead at a hospital, while his friend, who was grazed, was treated for non-life threatening injuries.
Daniel Rolf designed the first volume of Beecher's mindful of evidence left by the act of reading. Bare binding reveals the book's construction; linen paper absorbs oils from the skin. The result is a physical record of interaction with the text.
Administration officials told reporters last week that a negative ruling would have virtually no impact on the law's implementation, noting that its two major provisions — the coverage mandate and the creation of new insurance markets — don't take effect until 2014.

The front door is surrounded by more stonework, this time brick, a feature used extensively throughout the property. Outside, a quarter-height brick facade is topped with vertical siding, while the interior of the house includes the same light-red brickwork in the fireplace and multiple planters, one of which is just inside.
The Fire Department of New York today doesn't count any call time in its response analysis, a change from 2008 and earlier, when it included the time during which fire-dispatch staffers handled the call. According to a report last month in the New York Post, that helped account for the record-low average response time—four minutes and one second—that the FDNY reported for 2010. The New York firefighters' union, which is seeking to reverse cuts to staffing, has said the change in measurement has produced only apparent improvement, not real change.
"It was instantaneous," said Marelich, now 73. His face was crushed, and doctors gave him almost no chance to survive.
Regardless of whether a district investigation confirms test fraud, Missouri education officials take the district's response as the final word. And when cheating is confirmed, the state issues no penalties, other than invalidating the affected students' scores. But the numbers of tests, the grade level and subject area involved are not easily available to the public.
When seven seconds remained, the ball was in Singler's hands. His "nose-to-the-goal'' drive, as Altman labeled it and Garrett Sim's basket before it, ended with the ball bouncing softly off the glass and in, with two seconds to go. Creighton, out of timeouts, missed a desperation heave.
Yep, this guy might just make 100. And he might still be singing.

A UO spokesman said last week Oregon doesn't necessarily agree with the NCAA's proposed violations, despite the word "agreed" appearing three times throughout both released sets of documents. Why the university might be playing coy could be a case of self-preservation.
In Marta Mossburg's recent column, she states that "there is a reason people are evacuating Baltimore City" and "flocking" to Harford, Frederick and Carroll counties (A grand debate," Sept. 14).
As Vinas began to meet higher-ranking members of al-Qaida under the command of Saleh al-Somali, the network's former chief of external operations, he caught their attention by suggesting that the Long Island Railroad — a commuter rail system he knew by heart — would make a ripe target for an attack, using a suitcase full of explosives left on a train. He also pitched the idea of blowing up a Walmart by buying a television, rigging it with a bomb and returning it to the store.
While the polls were still open, Santorum announced a campaign schedule that includes rallies today in Kansas and Mississippi, both of which hold primaries within the next week.

Tyler's Jane is ladylike and well-bred and even, at times, the jovial Brit. Pearce effectively communicates Ariela's sadness and disbelief as the Nazis march through Paris. Serra's Louisa initially glows with optimism when describing her happy early life but turns robotic and drained of warmth in relating the medical horrors she witnessed. In statements like "I had no choice," Serra reveals Louisa's searing guilt.

"California is ahead of the curve," Zelman said. "But if there is no health reform, and there is no money for health reform, then how does the health exchange come up with the money to subsidize all the people?"
For many, chili has become a traditional Super Bowl entree. Not only is it delectable, it can easily be made a day in advance, tucked into the refrigerator and the kitchen cleaned up long before guests arrive. For serving, I reheat it and slip it into a slow cooker on low setting (or if I have enough time, I simply reheat in the slow cooker -- but remember that cold chili can take well over an hour to heat).
Hundreds of those former patients have since sued St. Joseph and its parent company. The hospital has also lost revenue, patient admissions and doctors and other staff. The hospital recently said it would lay off 17 workers.

"He's a good run blocker and he's a good pass blocker," Schwartz said. "Even though he's still a young player and he'll still improve and take other steps, we're not drafting a guy that's a developmental player. He's a very experienced player.

Answer: Like Fink, I just got a new passport and was puzzled about why it arrived in one heavy envelope and the documentation I had provided in another. I was smugly certain it had to do with security, and in my smugness, I disregarded the lesson of Ockham's (sometimes spelled Occam's) razor: The simplest solution is usually the correct one.

The Rock-N-Soul Revue was visibly more comfortable playing classic material from the '60s than it was with Bon Jovi-style hard rock, but the group was perpetually game. Bandiera claimed to have fun learning Nicole Atkins' material, and the Hope Concert group burned the studio haze off of "The Way It Is." Bonds, still a vocalist of fearsome power at 72, roared through a version of his "New Orleans," a song that first hit in 1960; a bit later, he traded verses "A Change is Gonna Come" with the ingratiating Southside Johnny. Sam Cooke was a popular choice for singers at the concert: Fallon and Southside Johnny shared lead vocals on "Wonderful World" and "Good Times." It was fascinating to hear Fallon apply his raspy punk rock delivery to vintage soul; it would have been even nicer if Southside Johnny had given the younger singer a little more breathing room on the center microphone.
On Christmas Day 2003, her daughter, Quintana Roo Dunne Michael, was admitted to the intensive care unit at Manhattan's Beth Israel North hospital after a bout of flu became pneumonia and then septic shock; a coma was induced and Michael was placed on life support.

For years, we've heard predictions about the cars of the future and seen them depicted in pop culture from the writings of Jules Verne to TV's The Jetsons.

As with the July 2011 release of Casey Anthony, the Florida woman acquitted of murder in the death of her young daughter, Zimmerman was released around midnight. But the similarities end there. Anthony was quickly whisked away by deputy sheriffs armed with rifles as angry protesters jeered her. While news helicopters briefly tracked her SUV through Orlando before she slipped from public view, there was no such pursuit of Zimmerman, who will have to return for trial.

"The broadcast became legendary because it reached millions of people and demonstrated how many people could be affected all at once by a small group of people playing a joke," says Boese.
The latest evidence of this quiet revolution came with the release of the Republicans' midterm-campaign "Pledge to America." Though the pledge gives a perfunctory nod to "traditional marriage" (in a single line in a list of things, like "families," that it supports), explicit opposition to marriage for same-sex couples is conspicuous in its absence. The document never uses the word "gay" (or "homosexual") -- a stark contrast to past party platforms, which have made opposition to gay equality a centerpiece of their social agenda.

The footage of the births -- specifically, the back-and-forth between the unnamed camerawoman and the OR staffer who wanted her to GET OUT OF THE FREAKING WAY -- was the only compelling part of the special. Call it Octo-overload. At this point, we're so inured to Suleman's self-justifications, self-delusions and lack of self awareness that watching her bicker with her mother, complain about the paparazzi, and, um, lose one of her children (turns out he went for a walk with the nanny; sorry, 911!) felt like so much white noise.

If this all sounds like a drag, it is. It becomes increasingly difficult to root for Tom and Violet to stay together when they seem to be headed down such divergent paths. Stoller and Segel try to liven things up with wacky gags and oddball supporting characters, and the movie finally finds some much-needed whimsy at the absolute end. But by then, it's too late.

Avon, N.J.: Dear Mayor Bloomberg, why don't you challenge the five major apparel industry leaders to bring some manufacturing back to the city? You know who they are: Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Jones New York and Liz Claiborne.

Just down the road, Gayle and Brian Sullivan are single-handedly keeping Dry Creek Valley from becoming a mono-fruit culture. When they bought Dry Creek Peach & Produce in 2000, neither knew much about peach farming. But when they realized theirs was the only remaining peach orchard in the county, they dedicated themselves to preserving its legacy. In the summer months, visitors line up at the farm stand to sample nearly a dozen varieties of all-organic white and yellow peaches, along with nectarines, plums, pluots and handmade jams. It's not hard to figure out why: One bite of a juicy, sweet Suncrest or Red Haven will have you wondering whether you've ever tasted a real peach. And the fresh peach bellinis, served at the Hotel Healdsburg bar, are so scrumptious, you'll be tempted to give the bottom of your stem glass a tongue-washing.

How about those of us who have retired and have a small portfolio of blue chip stocks whose dividends augment Social Security? Putting money in a savings account or CD at current interest rates is hardly worth the gas to drive to the bank.

Likes: Although it doesn't replicate running as precisely as a treadmill, the Elliptigo's erect body position and no-impact elliptical motion is close enough that it's used by masters runners to get a near-running workout without joint strain. It's addictively fun and as fast as a bike. There's no real learning curve if you've been on an elliptical machine; neighbors of mine hopped right on, circled the block and didn't want to stop. Includes lightweight carbon-fiber crank arms and an 11-speed internal rear hub, shifted by fingertip levers, that handles high speeds and steep hills great — much better than the 8-speed model I reviewed two years ago. The adjustable handlebars fold down to 35 inches high.

Once, when attempting to explain how certain movie directors could achieve what they were after despite bad acting or a problematic script -- think Stanley Kubrick with "Barry Lyndon" -- I conjured up the phrase, "He did it with texture." So Jill Paton Walsh, fresh from filling in for the late Dorothy Sayers, creates the fictional and delightful St. Agatha's College, Cambridge, as the motor that drives her Imogen Quy mysteries. Quy (rhymes with "why") is the resident nurse and a fellow St. Agatha's who uses her intuitive smarts about the quirks and rhythms of academic life to trap a killer tangled up in a production of the "Bad Quarto" of Shakespeare's "Hamlet." The finish is less than gripping, but I could happily baste in the texture of St. Agatha's for years.

Possibly because of his diminutive stature and his hardscrabble past, Brown was often on the defensive, a man whose id was inseparable from his talent. "Instinctively, the singer responded to obstacles in his path with a display of money and aggression," Smith writes of Brown's oil-and-water dynamic next to a pacifist such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. That hardened exterior led later in life to his infamous run from the police and a considerable jail sentence — and an unwillingness to admit he might have had a drug problem. (Jail, on the other hand, made him a martyr, Smith suggests.)

"Ignorance, fear and shame," she said. "If you're healthy and young and your employer pays for a good bit of your premium, you're insulated from it.

After each of the playoff exits the past two years, instant revisionists claimed the Cavaliers were a flawed team, that the regular season doesn't really mean much. Easy to say after the team is eliminated. Bottom line: The Cavaliers were the No. 1 seed in the entire pool for two straight seasons, which means they were a favorite to win it all.
Obama used the rural setting -- he spoke inside a warehouse in front of sacks of seed corn stacked high on pallets -- to make it appear that he is not a fixture of Washington and is as worried about local concerns as he is about issues vexing the nation's capital. Obama represented Illinois in the state Senate and the U.S. Senate and told a man asking about federal regulations that he spent a lot of time thinking about "downstate issues."

Christie wants to eliminate the cash-outs for future workers. The Assembly plan would allow a maximum of $7,500 in accrued sick leave to be negotiated for use as a credit toward post-retirement medical benefits.

Of course, the decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was good news for same-sex couples in California. If the decision survives an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, then same-sex marriages might resume in that state within the next year.
“Wild Target” is — no shock — not to be taken seriously. (It’s a May-December comedy about a mass murderer, after all.) And even so, sometimes it’s sillier than it needs to be, or just plain sloppy.
