Even if we take the kindest view - that Buster Davis happens, Antoine Cason has had moments, English hasn't had a chance, Ryan Mathews is on the verge, Corey Liuget gets more time - you put Smith's last five first-round picks together and they so far add up to not quite as much impact as, oh, I don't know, one Clay Matthews.

Love’s Timberwolves (17-17) have improved greatly from the last two seasons, but will need a strong finish to end an eight-year playoff drought.

Baltimore County officials had touted the new data center as the county's highest economic development priority and pledged to extend roads and other infrastructure to serve the location in plenty of time for the project's planned 2015 completion date.

How did you go about that? I took a look at the rehearsal dinner event that was paid for by my husband's family and they needed help. They were ready to host a dinner. I looked at the event and said, "Let's make this night about him." I designed the event around his hobby, which is woodworking. Everything from the invitations to 2-by-4s running down the table was about him. When the guests arrived, automatically they knew it was about Dan. The groom's cake was shaped like a 2-by-4, and it was displayed on a real miter saw.

Under the act, the collection agency cannot make threatening or harassing phone calls, must stop contacting you regarding the debt if you send them written notification, and cannot threaten legal action unless there is immediate intention to do so.

Collectors may not contact you at work if they're told (orally or in writing) that you're not allowed to get calls there.

"It's like watching a live action show, but it's in your face. Over the past five years, we've seen some very dark clouds — we were sailing just before and after the hurricane last summer when it hit — and have had to rush back in the middle of a cruise. You honestly never know what the day's going to bring, and that does make a very interesting dynamic, as opposed to going to a museum. Parents have even said to me on a cloudy or stormy day that that's what makes it real: The fact that there's an ominous, gloomy feeling to the adventure."
But "Sell in May" has a lot of holes in it.
The media attention and public comment on the school shooting in Chardon afford an opportunity for action, not just reaction. Too many similarly tragic events have oc curred throughout our country (and abroad) -- each time resulting in community disbelief, deep sorrow and anger.

Remember when Duran Duran split into warring factions for a season? The members of the band who wanted to party formed Power Station, and the ones who wished they were in Roxy Music recorded as Arcadia? That’s basically what has happened to Oasis. Liam Gallagher has extended the rave-up, roughneck spirit of the band with his Beady Eye project, and big brother Noel has taken his High Flying Birds into slower, moodier, artier territory. With Oasis, Noel wrote some of the best ballads of the ’90s — “Don’t Look Back in Anger,” “Live Forever,” “Where Did It All Go Wrong,” to name a few — and while nothing on “Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds” soars quite that high, he does manage to recapture the grandeur of his old group. Oasis had been flagging for the past decade, but “(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine” and “AKA … Broken Arrow” should return his name to the conversation about the best traditionalist tunesmiths in modern rock. Always follow the ambitious songwriter; you’ll win more than you lose. That Arcadia album was surprisingly good, too.

Some of the agents say the women were not prostitutes. Rather, they met them at bars and did not pay them for sex. One Cartagena bar owner was quoted as saying some of the women may have been picked up in tourist bars, where they flirt with men and fail to tell them until the last moment that they charge for sexual services.

Remove the bowl from the water bath, and attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment. Beat the mixture on high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form and the meringue has cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low, and whisk in the soft butter in small increments. Make sure each addition of butter is completely incorporated into the meringue before adding more butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula if necessary. Once all the butter is incorporated (about 10 minutes), adjust the mixer to medium-high speed.

That payment is critical to investors because it would have made a big dent in Diamond's earnings had it been made by July 31, when the company's fiscal year ended. The company declined to specify the size of the payment, but it's possible to make a decent estimate. According to the Department of Agriculture, one billion pounds of California walnuts were sold in the 2010 crop. Diamond disclosed that in 2005 it bought 283 million pounds of walnuts, or about 40% of California's production. So conservatively assuming it bought 20% of 2010's output, the momentum payments would total $50 million. That compares with $93 million in operating income for the entire fiscal year.

Hey, Tony: I'm sure you get tired of the Hillis questions but ... a few months ago he stated he wasn't worried about his contract because he was sure the Browns would take care of him. He refused to hold out like Chris Johnson and worked through camp. Now Johnson is getting paid and the Browns have made Hillis a villain. In addition to that, the Browns really don't have any depth at the running back position as Montario Hardesty drops everything thrown his way and gets like two yards a carry. Is there any way the front office pays this guy or are they so committed to Hardesty? On top of that, if they actually use him, maybe Colt McCoy doesn't need to throw 40-plus times a game. -- Steve Ritchie, Lima

Brown Shoe's proxy statement, filed Tuesday, shows that Sullivan's compensation fell to $2.96 million in 2011 from $3.57 million in 2010. Her salary rose 8 percent to $800,000, but the lack of a bonus caused her incentive pay to fall to $300,000 in 2011 from $1.15 million the previous year.

A wild combination of poetry and audience interaction, this pointed allegory has become a hit on the fringe theater circuit from New York to Edinburgh. Billed as a postmodern theater happening, it pushes its audience into an absurd reality involving murder, suicide, poison powder and rabbits, some red and others white.

They've been pulling money out of stock mutual funds for most of the past three years, even as the market has nearly doubled.

What is the best advice you received that has helped further your career? What advice would you give, particularly to the student who may think math, science or engineering are "too hard" for him or her? I excelled in music, but science was my passion.

And yet, as effective as Sutherland is in "Touch," some daunting questions will be hanging over the sci-fi-esque drama when it moves into the 9-10 p.m. Monday time slot on March 19.

The EPA will try to determine what to do with water used during fracking, as well as water that is already underground and flows back up the well. Companies now often release the water from the production process into municipal wastewater systems.

The new numbers crunchers also reinforce what my dad knew watching Minoso ignite the Go-Go White Sox: The seven-time All-Star was one for the ages. Minoso was a slick glove at multiple positions, a speedster who led the American League in steals and triples three times each, a top-of-the-order line-drive hitter who drove pitchers crazy. Based on the complex calculations that statheads love, Minoso was the best all-around player not named Mantle or Williams in the American League during the 1950s.

The OLCC defends its investigation. But the outcomes in the criminal and civil cases suggest that it may have been too cursory. It's hard to understand why this case didn't merit a far deeper look, not only because two young women had been killed, but also because the bar had provoked multiple complaints in the past, even warnings from Gresham police. As Green wrote, it had been associated with more than 35 DUII arrests.

"The power of those gangster-like officials who once persecuted Chen Guangcheng, like the city party secretary and public security bureau director in Shandong, can by no means challenge the power of the central government or continue to hurt Chen Guangcheng. So I think his personal safety has absolute protection. And his freedom, within his regular life, is guaranteed too. I mean, for the family to stay together, freely work and freely live their life, there should be no problem. But for him to accept media interviews and freely defend human rights and receive petitioners, I don't think he really has total freedom to do those things."

International reporting: Jeffrey Gettleman of The New York Times for his vivid reports, often at personal peril, on famine and conflict in East Africa, a neglected but increasingly strategic part of the world. Finalists: The New York Times staff for its powerful exploration of serious mistakes concealed by authorities in Japan after a tsunami and earthquake devastated the nation, and caused a nuclear disaster, and the Thomson Reuters staff for its well-crafted reports on the momentous revolution in Libya that went beyond battlefield dispatches to tell the wider story of discontent, conflict and the role of outside powers.

A move toward early elections is the latest sign that a threatened Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities is unlikely in the coming months. Though no final decision has been made about moving up national elections slated for next year, the Knesset, or parliament, is talking about dissolving this month and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to announce as soon as next week an election date in September.

Get started by removing the old door. First, take off the interior and exterior trim. For each trim piece, score the paint and caulking with a utility knife so as not to damage walls when removing it. Slide a putty knife into the joint where the trim meets the doorframe. Pry the trim away from the door enough so you can work a flat bar into the space and slowly pry off the trim piece. If you're careful, you should be able to reuse these pieces.

Akenson claims that the original Near Eastern religion that evolved into contemporary Christianity faced an enormous crisis in the year 70 when the great Jerusalem temple was destroyed by the Roman army. Before then, it had been a religion deeply rooted in a sense of place — the temple was the intermediary between the worshipper and the divine and to get in touch with the Almighty, you approached the altar. Once the temple was razed, God no longer had a home. Ingeniously, the early Christians did not concede defeat. Instead, they generated a doctrine that located a personal temple inside the heart of each believer. It had been an outward religion; now it was an inward one. And by releasing the geographical fetters, Christianity was free to become universal. You didn’t have to go to Jerusalem anymore — wherever you were, so was God.
