And because no holiday party, is complete without a boisterous beverage, Morales said he special orders little-known fruits that gives Ponche Novendaño a special kick.
Boundaries aren’t such a bad thing; they keep the cows from roaming the freeways. Should the urge strike to let one’s lips prowl the neck of another woman’s husband, true friendship and empathy make the best fences. A true friend might find herself attracted to your husband but would be careful to avoid saying or doing anything to tempt him or make you feel threatened. This “friend’s” sneak attack on your husband’s neck meat, along with her notion of sexual fidelity -- “Till death do us part or the NBA shot clock runs down” -- suggests that she’s a narcissist, a self-absorbed, manipulative user.

After you've worked up another appetite by hiking to the park's beach and around its headlands at the mouth of the Big Sur River, you'll have earned some R&R, and maybe a cocktail, further up the river.

It’s just a really big blessing that I was waiting to receive. I didn’t know when it was going to come. I’m at a loss for words, really.”
When you look at the most successful sports franchises, the teams winning championships, what you find are organizations that understand how success on the court begets economic rewards.

Isaiah's imagery is stark. Lamenting the loss of Israel's identity, the prophet sees a people who are burned out and weary from the monotony of life as exiles.

The rest went for maintenance, water-quality monitoring and other work. Garbage disposal fees pays for the work.

He hasn't yet rallied behind her but others have, including once and maybe future presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Near-term solutions include vehicle-to-vehicle warning systems where our cars computers "talk" to each other to help avoid accidents. Mid-term solutions include cars that are semi-automatic. Think advanced cruise control where the car could literally drive to a pre-programmed destination. Long-term solutions are outlined by connecting "automatic" cars that form vehicle trains on the freeways. Eventually leading to a point where once you get in your car, the car itself does all the work, and you can kick back and relax.

What happened: Mortgage brokers, banks and other lenders provided the funds so that unqualified applicants could buy homes. Brokers don't lend their own money but serve as middlemen, collecting commissions but sometimes without much regard to whether borrowers can make payments. Many banks weren't much better, selling loans to third-party investors while collecting fees. It didn't help that lenders unveiled innovative but risky mortgages, such as negative-amortization and optional-payment loans. Plus, many brokers and lenders never verified a borrower's job status, income or assets because they were passing the risk along.

He should go into the forest with a spear"), admiring a visitor's Bolex movie camera ("Ah, color film," he says, "the future belongs to color film"), or talking amiably with guests about "Gone With the Wind"?

Alan McClure of Patric Chocolate in Columbia has been crafting chocolate bars for a couple of years, using single-origin batches of cocoa beans he carefully roasts himself. But the $7 gourmet chocolate bar market is a slim one. Hoping to flesh out his product line yet stay true to his chocolate-making values, McClure approached artisanal chocolatier Christopher Elbow about co-branding a bonbon. Elbow, who frequently collaborates with local food entrepreneurs, was game. Recently, the two chocolatiers met at Elbows shop at 1819 McGee St. to test the marriage of Patric ganache with Elbows enrobing chocolate. I wanted to merge something unique that is not just Patric or Elbow, but is something new and exciting. Its intellectually interesting, McClure says between bites, and its delicious. Expect more collaborations in the future, including a co-branded chocolate bar and Patric chocolate ice cream.

In 2006, Michigan voters approved Proposition 4 to amend the state Constitution to restrict government's powers to take private land for public use. Among other things, Prop 4 expressly barred the seizure of land from one private owner to give it to another private owner, such as a real estate developer.
But you have to remember, no drug - brand or generic - works exactly the same way for everyone. If you are taking a drug that requires very precise control of the dose, a generic's "equivalent" status may not do the trick for you. This problem is common with thyroid medications, so you're not alone in your difficulties using the generic version. Even for less-demanding medical regimens, a generic might not work the same way as a brand. Generics can use a slightly different "release" technology (altering how it gets into your system) and can change inactive ingredients like binders, fillers, preservatives, coloring and flavoring.

"The worst thing you can imagine in our profession is a bad cop," he said.
The new evaluation system is shaping up to be the most problematic issue Ms. Lowery will confront because, despite the common-sense notion that teachers ought to be accountable students' progress, there's very little agreement so far on how to do so in a way that's fair. Many teachers are uncomfortable with the concept because they fear being held accountable to a test that doesn't actually measure how well kids are learning. Others wonder how the system will work for teachers in subjects that have not been tested — chemistry, art or music for example. Still others question whether it will penalize teachers in high-performing school districts, where student achievement levels are already high, while rewarding teachers in low-performing districts for marginal improvements in student performance.

Last but not least, Prop. 19: Apart from the looseness of the proposition's language, in this instance federal law is most decidedly not on its side. According to an analysis by the Los Angeles County D.A.'s office, whose occupant may be the next state attorney general, California employers would not be allowed to "screen job applicants for marijuana use, regulate any employee conduct related to the use," or otherwise "choose to maintain a drug-free workplace consistent with federal law."

Page 107: State Medical Examiner Dr. Karen Gunson told jurors that Collins bled to death from a gunshot wound to the left hip. She described the four bullet wounds he suffered and self-inflicted cuts to his neck. She also said she detected no odor of alcohol on Collins' breath or body during the autopsy. The fatal bullet passed through his pelvis, and passed into the abdominal cavity. As it passed through the abdominal cavity, it severed the larger artery called the "left iliac artery." That artery comes right off the aorta, which runs down the backbone, and "then it splits into the two iliac arteries that go down your legs.'' The bullet exited his lower abdomen. There were 1,100 cc's of blood present in Collin's abdominal cavity, and down the back of his pevic fossa, the lower part of the cavity, Gunson testified. That would translate into a quart of blood. (250 cc's is about one cup). "Now generally speaking, adult males have about 5,000 cc's of blood in their body. And when you lose about a quarter of that or around a quarter of that acutely, you will die from bleeding to death ... He bled to death internally into his abdominal cavity." A juror asked how long that would have taken. Gunson replied that it's generally " somewhere between 30 seconds or a minute or so." Another bullet entered the middle part of his upper right arm, which fractured the humerus, or large bone in the upper arm. The bullet exited the arm. A third bullet struck his left arm, fractured the humerus, or large bone in the upper arm, and exited out the left upper arm. It was recovered in Collin's sweatshirt. Another bullet struck just below his rib cage, but did not damage any internal structures, and exited out. The bullet apparently passed through the zipper of his coat and it struck, "and that made it wobble in its flight." Gunson said she couldn't tell which were the first two wounds, and which two followed. Collins had fresh, self-inflicted cuts to the left side and right side of his neck. The cuts on the left side she described as "hesitation cuts," shallow cuts that don't go all the way through the skin. On the right side, the cuts were deeper, but he did not cut any of his major blood vessels, Gunson said. From her examination of Collins' body, she said she could tell he had a mild heart attack in the past, noting a scar on his heart muscle, and possibly emphysema, which could have impaired his ability to move around. Toxicology test results were not available at the time the grand jury heard testimony. Gunson said that takes three to six weeks to obtain.
