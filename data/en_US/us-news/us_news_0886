But after Saturday's primary, the caucus schedule enters a bit of a lull. “The process slows down," Overby said in a telephone interview on Thursday.

Everyday as Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses, we create plans of care for our patients. It may be as simple as getting the patient out of bed for breakfast and preparing him or her to transfer to a regular floor.

Sometimes these patients may have to wait until the next day until a bed becomes available on a floor, and so we advance to having the person up walking. Yes, even in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, folks get up and walk!

In that sense, the Grammy nod is sort of like Roberts' career: The journey has been the reward. Roberts always wanted to be a musician - he and some friends formed a band at Kenyon College and moved to Minneapolis with the intention of making a go of it.

Dear Margo: My mother just passed away, and I am the eldest of three brothers. For some odd reason, we don't communicate often due to how our family was structured. I am not a perfect person, though I have tried to seek redemption for my past mistakes. I am the one, however, who is still perceived as having mental issues and no concept of the "real world." Everyone is entitled to perceive and interpret the world as they will, but it seems that once people have made up their minds, they only see what they want to see. I am finding that you can't restructure a family or avoid dysfunctional arguments. Since the death of our mother, we've had some bonding, but there is still tension in the air. My question to you is: Should I just ignore them when they contact me? Whenever they do, it is just to pick a fight. How would you handle the situation? — Uncertain

Tonight's stop in Vancouver is one of the most highly anticipated Blues' games of the season. Well, at least to me it is. The Blues, a resounding 4-0 on the current road trip, have a chance to move into first place overall in the NHL with a win over the formidable Canucks.

The team and the stadium are what McCourt and Major League Baseball officials agreed the beleaguered owner would sell. But because McCourt split off the parking lots from the team in 2005 and put them under a different corporate entity, they are not part of the Dodgers bankruptcy filing, and he has the option to sell or lease them to the new owners. (If McCourt retains ownership of the lots, he can try to develop the property but would have to provide parking as well.)

Rising star chef/owner Oswaldo Bibiano likens his tres leches or "three milks" cake ($7) to a Mexican tiramisu, though teetotalers need have no fear. Instead of soaking the egg yolk-rich, orange zest-accented cake in booze, Bibiano has it absorb a dousing of evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and half-and-half. Once the cake has soaked up the milky infusion, it gets a generous gilding of whipped cream and a sprinkling of coconut.
Coming from a privileged background has never been a disqualifier in presidential politics -- consider the Bush family, the Kennedys, the Roosevelts. Maybe that's because voters recognize that no candidate can have personal experiences that match those of all the diverse groups in America. So they don't expect candidates necessarily to empathize with them. Instead, they look for a candidate whom they trust to do what's right for the broadest group of people.

The longer answer, of course, is a bit more involved than that, since there are many ways to make hanging baskets. I used perennial Oxalis oregana, which is an aggressive sorrel, or you could use an attractive Trifolium cultivar. Both have a shamrock look to them. (See? There is a St. Patrick's Day tie-in.) Bottom line, just make sure they are aggressive spreaders or your basket could wind up looking sparse.

But its a bad loss in terms of playing badly. Nobody can remember a time that Michigan State looked worse in an NCAA game, especially in a game where they were expected to play so well. We knew that the Cardinals would press, but the Spartans seemed ill-prepared to handle it. I didnt see this is a sign of fatigue, either physical or mental. I saw it as a lack of preparation, which is stunning from a Spartans team.

4. Credit card companies will continue to court your business with terrific flier-mile offers. 2011 may be remembered as the year British Airways seduced us with the promise of 100,000 flier miles for signing up for a Visa card (and you had to spend a little too). The BA website (www.britishairways.com) was recently offering 50,000 miles for a card sign-up — still not bad. You may recall, though, that BA whacks you with a big fuel surcharge on a so-called free ticket, so you might be better off spending your miles on one of its partners in the oneworld alliance (American is one) that don't charge those kind of fees. What's the best way to find these dandy offers? John Di Scala, better known as JohnnyJet.com, likes TravelHacking.org, which offers a 14-day trial for $1. Before you play the credit card game, remember that some card companies may charge you a membership fee and as much as 3% on foreign transactions.

øA: It depends on the country. Germany and France remain quite strong. The U.K. and Spain and Southern Europe are doing less well. I think for different reasons, the U.K. is more focused on an austerity type of an economic plan, whereas Spain has very high unemployment and had a bubble that burst there. Those countries are tougher for us. Meanwhile there's a lot of growth ahead in Eastern Europe, and that's why we opened our first store in Poland. It was received to rave reviews by the Poles.

Stewart Mandel, SI.com: "Long presumably put out feelers to non-interim candidates and realized he wasn't going to land a desirable permanent coach in the middle of April. The press release announcing Smith's hire says as much in the last paragraph. The options on the current staff were equally uninspiring: The two coordinators (Paul Petrino and Paul Haynes) and the current interim coach (Taver Johnson) just arrived this offseason. None of the current assistants are more qualified than a guy with 18 years' head coaching experience. Had Smith never left for Weber State, his appointment would have been an anticlimactic no-brainer. The more puzzling element and the biggest source of fascination is why Smith would give up considerable job security and burn bridges at his alma mater to accept a job that comes with a 10-month expiration date. The eccentric, adventure-seeking Smith -- he's run with the bulls in Spain, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, skydived and trained with Marines -- always seemed like a more natural fit at a low-profile Western outpost like Weber State, but he ditched that gig quicker than Petrino did the Falcons."

Some digital stations that had been coming in well may go blank, and your converter box or TV will tell you you're not receiving a signal. Don't panic. That likely means that the station has switched to a new digital frequency. Locally, you can expect a change in WJW Channel 8 and WKYC Channel 3. In order to get those stations back you need to "re-scan" or "auto program" your TV or converter box to find the channels on their new frequencies. For good measure, you should re-scan one last time over the weekend to make sure you pick up any channels that might switch their frequency later in the day on Friday.

The inert bomb was part of an elaborate sting by two undercover FBI operatives who had spent months posing as Islamic terrorists.

Regulating hydraulic fracturing or "fracking" is not anti-business, it's a sound way to protect health and public safety while enabling responsible use of a valuable natural resource. Last week, theU.S. Environmental Protection Agencyissued rules restricting harmful emissions from such natural gas wells in a classic regulatory win-win. The new rules require drilling companies to capture gases that are often allowed to escape into the atmosphere. That not only protects the environment but provides revenue for the producers and is not expected to slow production.

I don’t understand all of the talk about whether the Giants put 12 men on the field on purpose on that final drive. Tuck was running off the field without a helmet. (Wait, isn’t it a 15-yard penalty when you take your helmet off while on the field? Anyway …) Clearly, it was a mix-up. Now, for those who are saying, “Hmmm, we’ve discovered something,” I wholeheartedly agree. And here’s my suggestion for a rule change: If a defense flagged for too many men on the field within the last two minutes of a half, the penalty should be enacted plus the clock gets reset to where it was before the play. So in that case, it should’ve been second-and-5 at the Pats’ 49 with 17 seconds to play, not 9. That’ll dissuade defenses from trying that kind of stuff.

What's more, none of the bills sets a timeline for appeals, one of the most important reforms needed. And Padilla's bill contains a troubling provision that would allow a school district to stop paying teachers accused of serious misconduct at the same time that it moves to dismiss them. This is an obvious response to the outrage over Miramonte, where teachers accused of molestation had to be paid pending the outcome of the dismissal process. Though the anger is understandable, not every accused person is guilty. It's troubling to think that a teacher could be stripped of wages before due process has taken place.

Never locate a gardenia close to sources of dry air, such as a heat vent in winter, or an air-conditioning vent in summer.

3. Superdome event, New Orleans: It doesnt matter if its the Final Four, the Super Bowl or just a random Saints game (bounties not included). You have to get to New Orleans for something just to experience the overall event. Bourbon Street is as advertised. Theres this feeling that theres a three day festival/party leading up to whatever game youre attending. Its the best way to watch sports. Instead of sitting in some hotel bar the night before, youre with thousands of people on the street celebrating the game and the city.

The Cavs under Dan Gilbert have never been accused of being cheap, and since they acquired O'Neal later anyway, I don't think that criticism is valid here.

You don't think it's a diversion, do you? You don't think he's saying, "Hey, hey, don't look at that thing in Iraq costing $8 billion a month and, so far, more than 3,000 U.S. lives; look at the nice things I want to do on health care, energy and the environment"?
The Kasich budget has its good points, but the assault by the governor and his GOP pals in the legislature on the consumers' counsel did Ohio homeowners and renters no favors. Is it a complete coincidence that utility lobbyists are in Kasich's inner circle?

Kapur adds a twist to the simplest items, such as a green goddess salad made with cucumbers that are chunked, sliced and shaved to bring out different textures and flavors.

"Tinker Tailor" may be one of the more difficult spy movies ever made, an elliptical story told with a throwback visual sensibility, extreme quiet and a storyline that is more allusive than linear.

In a thought-provoking essay published online Wednesday, R. Alta Charo, an attorney with the schools of law and medicine/public health at the University of Wisconsin, argues that the larger argument is about more than just public health. The bigger issue, she says, is whether individuals should be free to use religious beliefs to limit access to public goods used by people with different beliefs (such as contraceptives) or whether people performing public functions -- such as doctors, pharmacists, police officers -- should be required to serve the public regardless of individual beliefs about what is sinful.

Trailing 64-62 with 1.7 seconds left, the Tigers needed to go the length of the court. Milton Jennings' pass was intercepted by Mosley three-quarters of the way down the court , and it looked for a moment as if the Maryland senior had caught the ball in bounds, then stepped on the sideline. That would have given Clemson a final chance near its basket. But the officials ruled that Mosley had caught the ball out of bounds.

Reese responded: "You know that's a great question. I appreciate you asking because we are reducing our patrol response. Many days, like today, we're taking emergency calls only for service. For example, we had a rape victim stand by for 3 hours until we could get an officer to take a report, and that makes all of us very sad."

10. Let them carry you: The crowds that line the route -- the bands, the drummers, the signs -- are better than any steroid. High-five the kids and marvel at the community going on. For an extra boost, write your name, or the nickname you always wanted, on a sheet and pin it to your shirt. That way strangers will call out: "Run Mrs. Cougar run!" – or something like that.
After the first five-hour leg, the Tenaya Lodge, a 244-room resort two miles outside of the south entrance of Yosemite, was the ideal stopping point.

Any advice for teachers looking to be next year’s teacher of the year? Throughout my career I have always felt that in order to teach students something you must make a personal connection.

But facts are facts. I think it’s important that we all recognize that while counties and towns all across the state are laying off workers, cutting back on services and increasing taxes and spending just to make ends meet, Gloucester County is cutting tax rates, cutting spending and keeping great services. And it is the Democratic officials who are responsible for cutting taxes and spending here.

The trustees thought they were responding to criticism of high presidential salaries in January by offering raises to new presidents of no more than 10 percent.

But that's just part of her work. At home, Francoise stables a neighbor's cow in return for the cow's manure, which she uses to fertilize crops that she grows on her property.
In Mountain Lion, Documents In The Cloud works exactly the way you'd hope. The Mac's standard open/save dialog now has two sides. One is the familiar Finder-style navigator and it works with all of the files on your local hard drive.

Employees, for example, most value workplaces with direction — where the corporate mission is clear and leaders can articulate goals. Right behind comes career issues, meaning workers feel they have futures and are provided with the skills or training to move up the ladder. Then comes execution (managers who help get things done efficiently and include workers in the game plan), then conditions (good working conditions and family flexibility), and then management (do I have a good boss?).

I have no way of knowing how Steve talked to his team during Apple's darkest days in 1997 and 1998, when the company was on the brink and he was forced to turn to archrival Microsoft for a rescue.

"We're prepared with more than one plan. I'm going to use all the tools in my bag."
Attanasio also got Pettitte to praise Clemens’ work ethic, mechanics and concentration — not to mention the seven Cy Young awards he had won for his outstanding pitching. The cross-examination got to feel so much like a Clemens infomercial that prosecutor Steven Durham objected at one point.
At the risk of sounding heartless, extending in-state tuition benefits to illegal immigrants shouldn't even break the top 100 on any list of American public policy priorities. Pia is right that the outcry is disproportionate, but for the wrong reason.

Everybody loves a good political sex scandal  the ritual apologies, the jokes, the schadenfreude, the self-righteousness (from everyone else, of course). But The Times editorial boards of old tended to stay out of the graphic, cheeky media hype, refusing to opine on some of the most lascivious of political tales  from 1970s prostitution stings, the 1983 congressional page corruption, to Larry Craig's quasi-outing last year. When it did pronounce on the lewdness of our elected officials, the board's tone ranged from disappointed to dismissive as it strove to put sex scandals in the context of their wider political relevance, whether as part of wider corruption or crimes, a character flaw in a major leader, or as a reason for some meta media and political analysis.
