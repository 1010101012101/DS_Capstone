Many older workers are responding to the economic downturn by postponing retirement, but even so, it will be a struggle to make up for market losses in their retirement plans. Some were counting on their houses as a post-work financial cushion, but now their homes are worth less. They can't depend on dividends and interest on savings -- that income has nearly vanished. They also face layoffs and difficulties getting rehired.

She prays with them, and looks for ways to help them find their way back into civilian life.

Sprouting also causes some trace minerals, such as zinc, to be "freed up," or released, from the bran of the wheat kernel, says Rooney, who is also a spokesman for the Institute of Food Technologists.

The secondary was one reason the Lions had three plays totaling 204 yards in the first meeting. The Bears have been tinkering with it since and continue to rotate Major Wright and Brandon Meriweather at strong safety. But the defense has nine interceptions in the last three games, picking off Matthew Stafford four times Sunday and the Bucs' Josh Freeman four times Oct. 23. That's the kind of opportunistic play Smith demands. As we saw Sunday, it's easy to win even with a lackluster offensive performance when the defense and special teams provide scores.

Against a backdrop of a soured economy and slumping job market, 2.3 million registered voters in Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale counties will have a chance to cast an up or down vote. Those voters will have to be convinced the Beltline project will help commuters and serve as an engine of economic redevelopment that will benefit in-town residents and suburbanites alike. Beltline-related discord has already bubbled to the surface between Atlanta and its closest neighbors. North Fulton mayors have gone on the record saying the Beltline is not a regional project, a criticism that elicited a sharp rebuke from Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed.

Barugons are giant horned lizards who blink sideways, give off deadly rainbows, have long tongues which emit freezing rays and squirt blue blood. Barugon freezes Gamera during a face-off.
ADHD kids can be chatty, impulsive, forgetful, disorganized and spotty about following directions. Those traits can be managed at home. Parents can impose order through routines, schedules and simple, specific instructions. It's different at school. Playing the jack-in-the-box in class, lapses in following instructions and following through, and nonstop chatter can dig children into a scholastic hole.
I wouldn't count on either team picking up Soriano anytime soon. Boston has this guy named Big Papi, and the Yanks already had Soriano and sent him to Texas for A-Rod.

Nevertheless, Lewin's joy in communicating "the workings of our world and its astonishing elegance and beauty" is infectious. You will learn a lot from "For the Love of Physics": How to see rainbows in the shower and fogbows in the fog (car headlights; pull over); how to give yourself a halo; how to make a battery with a potato, a penny, a nail and a couple of wires. The concluding chapters are a primer on his specialty, cosmic X-rays (so named because, initially, "they were 'unknown' (like the x in an equation)." In his attractively unworldly (for an author) way, he peppers his book with helpful Web addresses.

When LeBron James tweets that "Karma is a b*#tc" shortly after his former team loses by 57 points, he is revealing more about himself than he ever would through a beat writer or canned ESPN interview special. Contract extensions (for Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant), injury updates (for Bears safety Chris Harris) and victory guarantees (from Cincinnati Bengals outspoken wide receiver Chad "Ochocinco" Johnson) are more efficiently reported by athletes via Twitter than through third parties anywhere else.
Army officials at Fort Wainwright were unavailable for comment last week. In 2009, the Army successfully argued in court that Alaska's workers' comp law shielded it from liability.

The Super Bowl-or-bust Vikings got Moss from New England on Wednesday for a 2011 draft pick, as Minnesota hopes to rejuvenate a stagnant offense for a challenging stretch of games.
Why it makes sense: The Redskins have some weapons on offense that are ready to flourish — especially TE Chris Cooley and recently franchised TE Fred Davis — and an owner willing to break the bank for a short-term shot at success. Couple this with the fact that Washington has a young, exciting, playoff-ready defense and one could reason that an upgrade at quarterback is the only missing ingredient. Oh, by the way, the Redskins are more than $30 million under the cap.

That's created a curious network of volunteer defectors at the bottom of the bluff.
Experts warn that the tests could have a serious unintended consequence: Loans could be harder to come by for consumers and businesses. That's because the government's intense focus on thicker capital cushions might prompt banks to hoard cash and further curtail lending, said Jim Eckenrode, banking research executive at TowerGroup, a financial consulting firm. He said banks will have less room to offer consumers low interest rates, while corporate customers may have a tougher time getting financing for commercial real-estate and property development.
"I've know Rachael since she's been a freshman and I've coached her for a long time and that's probably the best game I've ever seen her play," said Davidson. "She was totally aggressive and just right there when you needed her. She was really a major part of the win."

Yet another absence of a finishing touch at Silo.5% is the dessert course, the sum total of which is a vanilla creme brulee and a dark-chocolate Chambord mousse served with marinated cherries and whipped cream.

For Burkheimer's latest exhibition, "In Site" at Disjecta, he has abandoned the comparatively diminutive scale and representational cues of his teahouses for something much larger and more abstract. Entering the gallery, one encounters the beginning of a wooden ramp that extends, at the same slight grade, throughout the entire exhibition space like a tilted platform. There are scant decorative flourishes. Apart from an enormous circle cut into its surface and a large rectangular block painted blood-red (an analogue of the teahouses' stools), the piece flaunts its modest materials: untreated wood nailed to bleacher-like supports.

Of course I view investment in startup public transit as the solution to both of these dilemmas. But start up public transit requires a 50 percent pony up from the state, as opposed to roads, which only require 20 percent ( the feds pay the other 80 percent). The latter infamous legislation was the result of the first budget of George W. Bush in 2001 and therefore it is entirely improper to blame President Obama or even Gov. Martin O'Malley, who inherited this outrageous double standard.

And Mr. Caine is only one of countless English—and Irish—actors who use the English language as an instrument to convey music as well as words. Where to begin? Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole, Judi Dench, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Ian McKellen, Helen Mirren, Albert Finney, Colin Firth, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, Ben Kingsley, Vanessa Redgrave, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Tom Wilkinson—the list is endless. Coming from a small parcel of the planet with a huge variety of regional accents, they seem to draw from a wider sonic spectrum than their American brethren, even when, as in the case of Gary Oldman, an Oscar nominee for "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," the volume is low and the emotional range is constrained by the character's nature.

I think it's a two-team race between Cleveland at No. 4 and Washington at No. 6. The advantage with Cleveland is you'd get two first-round picks this year, and in moving down only two spots, the Rams would be assured that two of these three players were available: Justin Blackmon (wide receiver), Matt Kalil (offensive tackle) or Morris Claiborne (cornerback). As for Washington, the relationship between Bruce Allen and Kevin Demoff, and Jeff Fisher and Mike Shanahan might make a deal easier to get done. Because they respect each other and know each other so well, a lot of the gamesmanship would be minimized – they can get right down to business. The only problem picking sixth is that Blackmon, Kalil and Claiborne could all be gone by then.

What the mayor wants to do is to dedicate 90 percent of the proceeds the city expects to get from a slots parlor to property tax cuts for homeowners. By combining that with a steady diet of spending cuts, she says she can accomplish a meaningful rate reduction without jeopardizing city services. It is a far cry from the cut-it-and-they-will-come ideas being floated by her mayoral challengers, at least three of whom are proposing ideas to more quickly and radically reduce the city's property tax rate. But it would provide much more impact than the idea of splitting slots revenue between tax reduction and school construction, and applying that tax reduction to everyone — owner-occupants, speculators and absentee landlords alike. Ms. Rawlings-Blake estimates that focusing the slots money this way would effectively double the savings for homeowners.

It would be cool to beat them as such underdogs. I feel like we have the ability, but I feel like they get in our heads.

* So what do the Rams do if they lose both Cleveland and Washington as trade buddies? Again, there are lots of variables. The Rams could be willing to move down to No. 8 (Miami) or even later in the first round if they receive a special bundle of picks, including a team's No. 1 choice in 2013. When I spoke to Rams GM Les Snead the other day, he even mentioned a scenario in which the Rams trade down in advance (to much later in the first round), collect a bunch of picks, and use some of the picks to trade back up again for a better spot in the first round. That could be the least likely scenario, but the Rams are obviously willing to consider all options.

I just got around to watching Madge do her halftime thing, and with the exception of the cheerleader bit (this is the Super Bowl, not "Glee"), I think she was her super-professional self.

Breitbart could be harsh at times, but he also had a magnetic personality that even many of his adversaries found appealing. He was a hero to conservatives, especially those who embraced the "tea party" movement, whom he passionately defended against charges of racism.

Shakespeare's brother, Robert Brown, said Friday that Shakespeare often wished he had never bought the winning ticket.
The market still rallied on Monday, though, because it wasn't just economic data that encouraged buying. Technical factors did, too.

That's a key development that hasn't occurred in over a year.

What's surprising about Mr. Santorum's view is that he falls back on the absurd stereotype of environmentalists as "tree-huggers" protesting some desirable road or development in order to save the habitat of an obscure species of plant or reptile, no matter what the impact on people. Certainly, protests over endangered species sometimes take place, but the kind of environmental agenda Mr. Obama has pursued has been far more about protecting and preserving human health.

The play is written in the characteristic Book-It Rep style, in which narration is spoken by various characters as they enact the scenes -- a device that McKeon says he hopes "propels the play forward without taking you out of it." It also emphasizes the connections between Anna's situation and Levin's by frequently presenting their actions side by side, in the way a film might intercut scenes that take place simultaneously but in separate locations.
