Teaching children about the mind/body connection, breathing and stretching can have lifelong benefits. Plus there's a fitness component, and it's a great stress reliever.

The Italian-American reality-TV slurs can be traced back to David Chase’s "The Sopranos," stripped of the irony. The idea of the state as a Rust Belt junk heap could come out of almost any Bruce Springsteen album. And as for the sour view of suburbia, I’d credit that dyspepsia to Philip Roth, except that would mean crediting the average Hollywood filmmaker with actually reading Philip Roth.
But TriMet is also locked in a two-year labor dispute with Amalgamated Transit Union 757 that's headed to arbitration. Last month, the state labor board ruled that TriMet can't go forward with proposed wage and retiree benefit savings because it unlawfully inserted them into a contract offer. That ruling, which TriMet is appealing, could cost the agency $5 to $10 million in fiscal year 2013 alone, TriMet said.

The takeaway: Cooper is the key, as he is a reward-risk player on a team that doesn't have a lot of quality perimeter players. When Cooper can run the offense, he is a smooth operator, particularly in the open court and in loose-ball scramble situations. But when teams force him into being a one-man offense, his percentages (34.8 FG, 31.1 3-pointers) start to play against him and the Bobcats, as they have no dependable inside game. Good team defense by OU has limited the dependence on Cooper to win games by himself.
The line will be called At Home by Victoria's Secret. For the holiday season, the items will come in three scents: "mandarin woods" (a mix of citrus and greens), "vanilla orchid" (precisely what it sounds like) and "cashmere fig" (which the company describes as a mix of "cashmere woods" and fig).

Sundhage wants the U.S. to play a possession-oriented style similar to the one Japan and France worked to near perfection in Germany, saying the traditional American gameplan of grinding opponents down on defense and sending long balls up to the forwards is too predictable. The offense should develop through the midfield, not start up front. By working from flank to center and back out with series of multiple passes, the Americans can probe the defense for weaknesses and create more opportunities — including chances for players who wouldn't normally score.

From the Rams' standpoint, St. Louis got a "mulligan" in 2004, the first milepost date when the stadium was supposed to meet "first-tier" standards as one of the league's top eight facilities. Instead, about $30 million in stadium improvements took place a few years after the 10-season milepost in '04. It doesn't appear there will be any mulligans this time around.

Grohl has called "These Days," which is currently atop the Billboard Rock charts, the best song he’s ever written. It’s almost too good to be a single: It plays like an old-fashioned album centerpiece and statement of purpose directed at longtime fans rather than casual radio listeners. "These Days" was only released after the ferocious, angular (almost King Crimson-like) "Rope" and the pensive rock ballad "Walk" became hits. It oscillates between a spare verse that could be described as pretty and a bludgeoning chorus that isn’t pretty at all. The refrain acts as a rejoinder to the opening, and even if you couldn’t hear any of the words, you’d be able to figure that out from the arrangement. Here, as elsewhere on "Wasting Light," the other Foo Fighters understand exactly where Grohl wants to go, and why — which hasn’t always been true on prior albums. Nate Mendel’s spring-loaded bass line feels like an expression of the narrator’s tension. Smear’s piledriver rhythm guitar on the chorus is as raw as rage. And right after a casual description of sudden death, powerhouse drummer Taylor Hawkins stops short in the middle of a steady beat.

Our readers did not buy this argument. They do not want their pets eating byproducts. They believe their pets deserve food of higher quality. Don't kids?
SEEMA MEHTA, Los Angeles Times
germaphobe, I am a bit of a zealot when it comes to clean hands, and that means I'm constantly applying hand lotion to combat dry skin. But this particular hand purifier does both, and it does both things really well. It has alcohol to kill germs, but it also contains food-grade, certified organic ingredients, including peppermint and vanilla essential oils to leave hands feeling like they are fresh from the shower. The gel is light and feels extra slippery for a few seconds, but it dries nicely and quickly - the result is never dry and sticky like cheaper hand gels. Of course, you have to pay a price, but a little goes a long way, and it saves on hand creams. The brand also has a spray version that is called a hand sanitizer for the same price. The spray is equally gentle on the hands, leaves hands feeling moisturized and takes no prisoners on germs, but the spray is pretty fragrant so you can't be discrete with it.

But look at her real appeal again. The womanly curves are those of a new mother. That breathy voice is that of someone whispering a lullaby. The Marilyn Monroe that connected with audiences wanted to take them to bed, all right. But mostly just to tuck them in.
The whole purpose of the editorial page of a newspaper, in R.C.'s view, was to get people to think ... the exposure of readers to libertarian ideas in the editorial page was designed to awaken in them the concept of self-rule and self-control. In fact, R.C. saw "the editorial page of a newspaper, which is kept open for contrary points of view, and which is well prepared and thoughtfully assembled, as a daily school room made available to its subscribers," whether "rich or poor, young or old, and without the duress of taxes nor the compulsion of forced attendance."

Chapman's argument that the United States shouldn't try to enforce its ethics elsewhere raises a few questions. So, the U.S. shouldn't have interfered in Libya and shouldn't be involved in Syria, North Korea, Iran or the Balkan states, and shouldn't continuously call out China on its human-rights policies? All for the sake of U.S. corporate profits?

• The New York Times' Harvey Araton thinks Carmelo Anthony has more on the line than Heat star LeBron James: "But there is another side to this high-profile showdown, another superstar whose reputation is on the line, or should be, in the best-of-seven series that will begin Saturday afternoon in Miami. The argument can be made that Carmelo Anthony has more to prove than James over the next 10 days to two weeks... He and the Knicks have to get out of the first round, or come darn close, if there is to be a positive spin put on the season for player and team alike."

Because no one sensed an immediate danger, the student was charged with disorderly conduct.

We learned that Melissa Gilbert isn't the only one with injuries. Her partner Maks Chmerkovskiy has been in a lot of pain from a cyst in his foot. While Maks was sidelined icing his aches, eliminated brother Val stepped in during rehearsals. But Maks was able to dance the Argentine tango to Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, and he included lifts and twirls and leaps. Melissa looked a tad overwhelmed at times. The drama of it all won the audience over, but not the judges. Bruno said "it wasn't clean." Carrie Ann said it was "Cirque du Soleil gone terribly wrong." Maks got angrier by the minute as he heard their critiques, but kept quiet as the crowd booed. Len thought some "quality" was lost due to the intensity of the moves. Defending herself, Melissa said, "It felt good to me. ... And I hope the audience enjoyed it, too." Scores: 7, 7, 7 = 21 When asked by co-host Brooke Burke-Charvet, "What do you think, Maks?" He replied: "I don't think, I just dance." Final score: 21 + 26 = 47

In the movie, Dorothy and her friends went to see the wizard to have all their problems solved, but quickly realized that behind the curtain was nothing more than smoke and mirrors. They discovered that they possessed what they were looking for all along and just needed to find the will to put their talents to use. Maybe there is a lesson here for us: that we must have the will and collective courage to cultivate conditions for change. Though clicking our heels and saying "jobs" three times will do us little good, we can still use our voice to demand a shift in the national conversation away from partisan political gimmicks and back to the challenges that matter most. The path to prosperity begins with a job, and it's time to put America back to work.
Downstairs, in the kitchen, Team White's Cheifetz roasted pecans for the sweet potato gratin. She was concerned that Team Navy had not only taken all the good platters, but had cut all the best flowers from the rooftop garden for its table arrangement. She had a trick of her own, however. In her entry e-mail, she had offered to say a blessing over the food, but now she thought a little Nat King Cole might just be enough to pull her team ahead in the presentation department. She had brought a CD of his greatest hits and planned to play it for the judges while they sampled Team White's dishes.

Binoche proves why she is such a world-renowned actress with the way she conveys ideas flickering across her brow and flashing behind her eyes. That skill makes her especially adept at portraying a journalist sitting in front of a computer or padding about her nicely appointed apartment, trying to focus on work but letting her mind wander to the laundry or the dishes or assorted distracted reveries.
I have spent my life struggling for the rights of working class people and for health care. I grew up understanding first hand what it meant for families who did not get access to needed care. I lived in 21different places by the time I was 17, including in a couple of cars. I understand the connection between poverty and poor health care, the deeper meaning of what Native Americans have called "hole in the body, hole in the spirit". I struggled with Crohn's disease much of my adult life, to discover sixteen years ago a near-cure in alternative medicine and following a plant-based diet. I have learned with difficulty the benefits of taking charge personally of my own health care. On those few occasions when I have needed it, I have had access to the best allopathic practitioners. As a result I have received the blessings of vitality and high energy. Health and health care is personal for each one of us. As a former surgical technician I know that there are many people who dedicate their lives to helping others improve theirs. I also know their struggles with an insufficient health care system.

This is about calling on government to do what it's there for in the first place: to protect us from the actions of others when, as individuals, we can't protect ourselves. It is appropriate, and urgent, that we act to protect public health from those whose choices about vaccines are putting the rest of us at risk: We make them stop.

Martinez had just retired Stephen Drew on a line drive to center to end the top half of the third inning when purple clouds rolled in from left field and rain deluged the field.

Dear O.P.P.: As you probably know, that word -- those initials -- stand for White Anglo Saxon Protestant, a tag that immediately calls up racism and religion to many. The word was last used in fashion during the first Bush administration, with first lady Barbara Bush the prototype of what some have called clothes that epitomize the suspension of style.

Those elements, especially the pop of hot pink, are all part of the fall fashion scenario from New York.

After his 2006 arrest, Dwek spent nearly three years as the undercover man in the federal sting. And the timeline drawn by the analysis of the complaints makes it clear Dwek worked at a frenetic pace, zeroing in on many potential targets at the same time.

This is crazy. Does any parent or CEO in America think education is 1 percent of the agenda in an age of global competition?

Although reviewers praised Chureau's heartier fare, they also found room to criticize the open, two-story dining room, which caused dishes to cool off quickly, and Chureau's lack of polish with more delicate dishes. The Oregonian gave Fenouil a B review in 2006, labeling the restaurant "corporate upscale French."

Set in South Africa, the story pivots around a murder that pits a black family led by a pastor (Chuck Cooper) against a white one led by a landowner (Daniel Gerroll). You've got the makings of a well-meaning, melodramatic tearjerker right there, and common wisdom is that Anderson's book is clunky.
Giuliana is the host of E! News. Bill is a 40-year-old entrepreneur and motivational speaker who won the first season of Donald Trump's "The Apprentice."
Perez, Sardine and Giannolla returned to the tunnel after the cast from "Jersey Boys" finished singing. Wet from a light drizzle and his arms weary from shaking the flag, Perez had only a smile on his face.
Still, given the care taken on so many fronts, a few elements don't jibe. While I understand the casual family-style atmosphere, it seems inhospitable that when the wine or water is brought to the table, the waiter doesn't pour the first round. The staff will pour a taste of the wine for the host, and when it's accepted, he plunks the bottle in the middle of the table.
Yost said the state has added more controls in recent years, and he's optimistic that there won't be more Greater Achievements in the future.

When Portland's Towncar.com and Fiesta Limosuine offered discounted rides through Groupon, the operators say city officials responded with threats to levy hefty fines. They cited city rules that force town cars to charge more than taxis. A Virginia-based group filed suit Thursday on the business' behalf challenging the regulations.
“I was in disbelief,” said busser Carly Maloch, 29, who showed up shortly before noon. “Lots of the girls have worked here for a long, long time. My two years here is just little compared with how long some of the servers have been here, but it was the best two years. I loved this job.”
"The beef industry and foodservice industry have really been pushing what are often referred to as underutilized cuts. Michael Symon and some of the other local chefs are geniuses at using cuts that are not well recognized such as a flat iron steak or skirt steak.

Q: Not long ago, a piece in the AJC mentioned that Newt Gingrich was adopted as a child, through a second marriage by his birth mother, making Gingrich the name of his stepfather. Can you tell us what is the name on his birth certificate?
"NBC contacted us, and said, 'You guys should audition,'" recalls Horwitch, 20.

"I don't know how you would quantify it," Benson said. "It's staff attorneys and time over there."
It didn't need to be this way. Affordable hatchbacks, from the Mazda2 to the Subaru Impreza, offer decent handling and reasonable ride comfort, but the Juke is more one-dimensional. Hard corners do bring noticeable body roll, but it feels less top-heavy than many crossovers. The steering exhibits decent precision, and it's a well-rounded setup. At lower speeds, the wheel turns with light effort; at higher speeds, it settles in with little power assist and good overall tracking. I noticed little difference between the Integrated Control system's modes, which allegedly alter power steering assist levels, too.
At a point where theaters often begin to hire administrators, though, Third Rail is trying to develop in-house day jobs for those already with the company -- who, after all, have done pretty well at the work so far. As Yarbrough puts it, "We started as a group of artists and want to make sure the artist remains the center of the work."
There were three touchdowns in 18 series in the scrimmage, with the offense starting each time from the 50-yard line and going until it scored or was forced into a punting situation. Bauserman hit Posey for a 33-yard touchdown on a crossing pattern on the first series, Graham hit Posey for an 8-yard score in the front corner of the end zone, and Miller ran in from 11 yards out after breaking a tackle in the pocket.
Ryan's kewpie currency lost much of its value after news of her affair with her "Proof of Life" co-star Russell Crowe broke (she was still married to Dennis Quaid at the time). She says she blamed herself at the time, but she says now that Quaid cheated on her.

Jellystone Park has a variety of options available from the cottage we stayed in ($119.95 to $164.95, depending on the season) to primitive campgrounds ($26.95 to $34.95). Next time, I'd love to stay a couple of days, this time in the tents they have already set up and with air-conditioning ($66.95 to $68.95). That's as close to roughing it as we'll get.

Only one primary election would be held, on March 6.
On Monday, construction on the Grand Prix course -- the 2.1-mile, 14-turn Raceway at Belle Isle Park street circuit -- began in earnest with 51 days remaining before IndyCar drivers roar onto the track for practice June 1.
for Joe Paterno, a place where "JoePa" knew best, where he not only won more football games than any other major college coach, but won them the right way: with integrity and sportsmanship. A place where character came first, championships second.
"It forced me to take children to a level that I thought was more honest than most people did," he says. "Because if life is so critical, if Anne Frank could die, if my friend could die, children were as vulnerable as adults, and that gave me a secret purpose to my work, to make them live. Because I wanted to live. I wanted to grow up."
Bowermaster says, "To have the opportunity to study the texts (instrumentalists) don't normally get that bonus that singers do. At its best, the text really informs the music. That was a real gift for me. It's been a labor of love the whole way."
We get it: The election really is about the economy. If so, the job market for many young people during the Obama presidency has bordered on, well, social Darwinism. Many students who did well in school either don't have a job or took one far below their expensive skills.
Parents whose children have not been singled out for the same recognition generally are not.
øAfter hitting the first batting-practice pitch he saw into the center field seats, Harper's first real home highlight came on an accurate 300-foot throw on the fly from deep left field that narrowly missed getting McDonald at the plate in the seventh inning.

Q: Did you ever understand the racist feelings against blacks?
One other omission that made me feel like a dummy was "True Grit." It is indeed a revenge movie, and that was evident again this week when I saw an early screening of the awesome new Coen brothers version with Jeff Bridges.
Chiang said last year the initial budget was not balanced largely because, according to his reading of the state constitution, it underfunded schools by $1.3 billion. He also said lawmakers failed to pass all of the bills necessary to carry out a balanced budget.

Dr. Michael Searson was recognized for Outstanding Contribution to Excellence in Teacher Preparation for his cutting-edge work as executive director of Kean’s School for Global Education and Innovation, as well as for his leadership of the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE).
Days before the primary election in Florida, a state with a large number of immigrants, Romney vehemently denied Gingrich's accusation that he is more anti-immigrant than any other candidate. And, as charges flew back and forth, Gingrich in return rebutted any suggestion that he wasn't the man to rein in federal spending.
Think about the status of the Ducks when Altman took over, and look where they are now. I am a big believer that 90 percent of the time you have to throw out a coach's first year when evaluating what she/he has done, because first years are often weird. In bad circumstances kids at the high school and collegiate level are often excited to play hard for someone new. So last year when the Ducks won the CBI, while I recognized it was an accomplishment for them, I sat back and thought, "Let's see what happens in year two."
It was big in many ways, first and foremost in that it assured a medal for Chobanian in her first appearance at the state tournament.
The issue has taken on greater urgency since last month's suicide of Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers University who killed himself after his roommate allegedly broadcast his sexual encounter with another man over the Internet.
"Rent isn't very expensive in Eugene," Acosta said. "I'm paying under $400 a month. I've had to eat a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. But I chose this.

"If Arizona does very well, we'll do very well," said Alabama Sen. Scott Beason, sponsor of a law that in some respects is tougher than Arizona's. In addition to requiring police to determine citizenship status during traffic stops, it directs government offices to verify legal residency for transactions like obtaining a car license, enrolling a child in school and getting a job.

"Although this approach is indeed a 'headline grabber,' which Dublin journalists at the time jumped upon, a more valid approach to get real usage data is through the city's wastewater system," Mr. Paull says. The cocaine found on all the bills in his study, if piled together, would amount to less than one ten-thousandth of a small dose.

Before pulling up to Sandwich's City Council chamber, Hultgren held a full day of meetings with residents in nearby DeKalb.
But things are not as idyllic as they seem. Chris, it turns out, is a petty tyrant, lording his authority over his household in small and large ways. Belle must wake before dawn to roll his cigarettes before a hunting trip, for instance. Peggy is having issues at school, and Brian is, like his old man, a creep underneath the smile. Darlin's biggest problem is simply living here.
He must have done something right. While results aren't revealed until the episodes air, Solero hints at a big win.

The Czech Republic has not made a mistake by avoiding the membership in the euro zone. I am glad we are not the only country taking that view. In April, the Financial Times published an article by the late governor of the Polish central bank, Slawomir Skrzypek. He wrote it shortly before his tragic death in an airplane crash near Smolensk, Russia. In that article, Mr. Skrzypek wrote, "As a non-member of the euro, Poland has been able to profit from flexibility of the zloty exchange rate in a way that has helped growth and lowered the current account deficit without importing inflation." He added that "the decade-long story of peripheral euro members drastically losing competitiveness has been a salutary lesson." There is no need to add anything to that.

"I can't continue financing their war chest to keep on buying these rights," said Dave Shull, Dish's senior vice president of programming. Passing on programming-cost increases to its subscribers would go against the company's main selling point, he said.
"You don't know what the heck they think," he says. "They're having a tough year. You don't have a cast on or a torn ligament in your elbow. You didn't have surgery. Do they think you're losing your mind? Do they think you don't want to play?"
øUsually the day after the New Year, I will arrive at the gym and find dozens of new people. Where these folks come from is a mystery. But you can be sure that by mid-February they will disappear, and the gym will return to its regulars. It happens every year.
Pryor's 14-yard run on fourth-and-10 late in the Iowa game was the kind of undiagrammable play, constructed from size and speed, that he was recruited to make.
In yesterday's victory over the Toronto Marlies goalie Jason Bacashihua stopped 17-of-18 shots the Marlies had on goal, his best game of the season until today. The back-to-back performances are encouraging after Bacashihua gave up a season high six goals in Friday's loss to the Moose.
Cunningham had the nickname "Bam" for his punishing running style. He had four touchdowns in a 1973 Rose Bowl win over Ohio State. In his first game in 1970 against Alabama, he scored two TDs and had 135 yards rushing against the then all-white Crimson Tide, leading a victory in a milestone performance.

Q: I am still looking for a recipe my mother used during WWII when sugar was rationed. It was baked in an 8-by-8 pan. The only part I can remember was she broke 2 eggs in a cup and finished filling the cup with dark Karo syrup. She used cocoa powder, not chocolate.
If I tell you this film is a study of one woman's torment, it might make "The Deep Blue Sea" sound unappealing, but it's riveting from beginning to end, because virtually at every moment, someone's entire life is in the balance. On most of those occasions, we're watching Weisz, but sometimes we're watching Simon Russell Beale as the husband, as he uses every ounce of British reserve, and every aspect of 1950s repression, to contain an impulse to burst into tears.
