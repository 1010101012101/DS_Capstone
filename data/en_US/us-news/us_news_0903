The Yankees did score six runs in each of the first two games, but squandered multiple chances to blow open the first game and did not really threaten until a too-little, too-late four runs in the middle game. Yesterday, the Yankees were shut out on three hits — all doubles — because they went 1-for-9 with runners on base, including 0-for-5 with men in scoring position.
BUT OUR TOILET IS BACKED UP; WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A LOOK? ... A man tried to rob three banks in Utica, N.Y., using a toilet plunger as a weapon. None of the tellers would give him any money.

Mr. Karnad, the security expert, said the tests had little impact on Pakistan, a nuclear power that has fought three wars with India. New Delhi's shorter-range ballistic missiles already cover Pakistani territory, he said. There was no immediate response to the test from Pakistani officials.
Literally, by the vandals who stripped out the furnace, water heater and most of the water pipes. And indirectly by others involved in the sale through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Thieves had time to kick both the back and front door in during repeated break-ins while bureaucracy dawdled.

These networks try to pack as much suspense as possible into the upfronts, but we already know a great deal about what the fall schedule will look like. We know, for instance, the identity of 32 series already renewed for the 2011-12 season. We know the identity of 15 shows already canceled. And we know that Fox will make a big move to rejuvenate its aging lineup with such high-profile newcomers as Simon Cowell's "The X Factor" and executive producer Steven Spielberg's "Terra Nova."

A spokeswoman for Kulongoski said the governor's office was reviewing the letter. Kulongoski is "open to new ideas" but wouldn't tolerate delay that would risk federal funding.
Sneaky comeback of the year: Grazing. In the '90s, a hot trend was grazing, a range of small, strongly flavored plates intended to overthrow the concepts of appetizer-entree-dessert. The concept faded due to confusion and not a little resentment, a suspicion that the servings had shrunk more than the prices. Now the concept is virtually universal, under the name happy hour, with dishes often more inviting than a restaurant's basic menu. (See: Urban Farmer.) There's a lesson -- as well as a cheeseburger slider -- for all of us in this: What pretentiousness can't achieve, economic pressure can nail.
A study by Minneapolis-based Everest Real Estate Advisors says that most of the demand over the next decade will be for senior housing with services, including assisted-living units and memory care facilities. With the region's population of people 75 and older projected to grow to 182,000 by 2020, the group says that at least 620 new units a year over the next decade will be needed to satisfy demand. This year, 625 will hit the market.
For dinner, think lobster or coq au vin, and finish the meal with a real showstopper, like a rich trifle.
We were nowhere near a zoo, in fact. We were walking through the coastal headland forest outside of Noosa Heads, the swank beach town that anchors the Noosa region in northeastern Australia. It's the kind of place where you can sip a cocktail late at night in a bar spilling over with gorgeous people, then swim early the next morning in a warm, glassy ocean filled with heavily tattooed surfers. The koala was just a surprise wildlife bonus.
For years before that transaction, he delighted many, frustrated some and was probably responsible for more long lunches  and more creative excuses back at the office  than any restaurateur in Sacramento history.
Japanese and Japanese Americans still make special trips to Gold Hill outside Placerville and venerate the grave of the one colonist who died and was buried there.
øWhy such a low withdrawal rate? Two reasons. First, taking withdrawals means you'll reduce your gains and increase your losses. If you earn 7% in one year and withdraw 5%, your account will grow just 2%. If you lose 7% one year and withdraw 5%, your account will shrink by 12%.

Did the editors of The Sun ever meet a tax increase they didn't like ("Pay now or later," March 14)?

"Ninety-five percent of the team is here, so I think we can get further down the road than we were by the end of last spring," Swinney said. "I'd like to see us come out of spring with a little bit of a swagger, a little bit of an identity on both sides of the ball."
“Oh, it was like handing a camera to a chimp,” Cameron says. “We were all these curious primates just trying to figure out how to run the movie machine. But it was a great place, because you were surrounded by people who loved film and wanted to prove themselves. There were no pretensions. It wasn’t about the aesthetics. We weren’t film-school grads. It was, ‘Hey man, I got a job doing some second-unit stuff!’”

In last week's poll, 53 percent of our readers said that on Christmas they celebrate the birth of Jesus. Verily D'Preacher added a point of emphasis in the online discussion. He said: "Annually, on December 25th, Christians celebrate the BIRTH, (focus now) NOT "THE BIRTH-DATE", nor the actual "BirthDAY" of the Messiah. No date is given or implied in the Bible as the actual 'historical' date of the birth of the Messiah."

Scheiber suggests that Obama could have gotten more. But given the depth of Republican opposition to any of Obama's proposals as well as the country's uneasiness with massive debt, that assertion faces a steep hill of doubt that he does little to climb.
If I listened carefully enough, in fact, the songs allowed me to tap into certain volatile emotions that felt otherwise out of reach. When I closed my eyes and immersed myself in Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke," for instance, I was overcome by a rare and all-encompassing optimism. AC/DC's "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" filled me with the intoxicating power of my own aggression. "Can't Stand Losing You" by the Police allowed me to accept my own romantic woes as entirely justified and maybe even somewhat comic.

On all visits the service was excellent, with a nicely paced parade of dishes, and waiters that change out plates regularly so the flavors of previous winners don't get in the way of the new ones. On one visit, we ordered the sorbet and were told it hadn't set up yet, so we switched to the cheese, which our server declined to charge for. I've seen the staff members go out of their way with other tables, too, and have also watched them accommodate various personalities.

Stage director Alison Chase, founder of Pilobolus Dance Theater, keeps nimble focus on the brave children who rally their forces to triumph over Brundibar (Czech for bumblebee). In some productions, including the original at Theresienstadt, Brundibar resembles Hitler. CityMusic makes him a thug in leather, bass-baritone William Clarence Marshall, who is aptly menacing.
Minimizing the contrast between trim and walls has a way of calming down a space and making it seem larger. This is put to good use in living rooms, which are prone to busyness or clutter. Instead of painting the bookcase and French doors the same soft color as the walls (Capri Coast OC–87), give them a slightly lighter shade (White Blush 0C–86) to preserve their character and keep the whole effect understated.

Norton Shores, Mich., retiree Patsy Ellerbroek, 65, is among those who have little empathy for the Wall Street protesters.
Signed to James Murphy’s respected DFA imprint, Holy Ghost! has opened shows for LCD Soundsystem. The synthpop act shares important similarities with LCD: deadpan vocals, a wry sense of humor, an impressive bank of analog instruments and a knack for late-night club-life storytelling. “Jam For Jerry,” their standout cut, is a glittering piece of Eurodisco — only it was made in the U.S.A. and its chorus is infectious enough to elbow its way onto mainstream playlists. They’re less detached than Cut Copy and far less sarcastic than Chromeo; now that LCD Soundsystem is no more, Holy Ghost! is the act most likely to keep the digital spirit of New Order alive and bleeping in the 21st century.

The original idea behind the space shuttle was to keep America in the forefront of space exploration, even as NASA budgets dwindled after the Apollo moon program, by making space travel cheap and routine. Well, it never proved anything like cheap; and the 14 astronauts killed on shuttles taught that spaceflight is never going to be routine. But the spaceship we see lift off for the final time today has maintained America as the leading spacefaring nation for 30 years.
Not all is lost. Bryant is just one game behind Newtown for second place and does meet division leader Adams twice, so it isn’t completely out of the question for the Astoria school to win the division crown. Plus, Tuesday’s come-from-behind, 8-2 win over Richmond Hill may have been a turning point. Bryant was struggling, down 2-1 before erupting for seven runs in the final two innings, including five in the seventh with two outs.

I'd come with questions, including: Are these guys for real? I mean, their story started out quintessential valley geek. Go to Stanford. Learn your way around serious programming. Start a company, in their case one that created online address books while incorporating some early social networking features, such as bombarding Internet users with Plaxo requests, which irritated some recipients. Then sell the company in 2008 to Comcast for a figure reported as north of $150 million. In short, software and the Web had been very good to Masonis and Ring. And yet they're turning from wonkish to Wonka. Why?

There seems to have been a real-life model for Ignatius, a medieval scholar and Boethius specialist with Ignatius' same strange wardrobe, love of hot dogs and chronic flatulence.

Cabins provide a full-size bed, flat-screen TV, and small desk. All studios are inside, and some have connecting doors to others. For more personal space, studio occupants have access to a dedicated two-story "studio lounge" where you can mingle with other singles or get a cup of morning coffee or an evening drink.

While unanimity may provide the beneficial appearance of strength and stability, critics question the usefulness of a vetting process that filters out alternative viewpoints long before items are addressed during the board’s regular monthly meeting in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, up in heaven, Selmon didn't go through the pearly gates like everybody else, he busted through after destroying a Judas/Goliath double team. … How great was Selmon?

Inside the visitors' locker room, an assistant coach approached Bears offensive tackle Ted Albrecht with some encouraging words. Albrecht raised his head to reveal the face of a beaten man. 'Coach,' Albrecht said, 'there are four things in the world I do not want to do under any circumstance: No. 1, I don't want to milk a cobra. No. 2, I don't want to be buried at sea. No. 3, I don't want to be hit in the head with a hockey puck. And No. 4, I don't want to play the second half against Lee Roy Selmon.' "…

What if your goal is to help kick-start a child's retirement savings? (Hey, it's never too early.) When Gerald gets his first job, he'll likely qualify to open a Roth IRA account. Roth IRAs are individual retirement accounts that funded by after-tax contributions. The savings grow tax-deferred until you reach age 59 ½, after which withdrawals from the account are tax-free. And unlike traditional IRAs, the government doesn't make you take minimum distributions from the account once you reach age 70 ½. A Roth IRA is also flexible: If Gerald needs the funds to pay for college costs or his first down payment on a home, he can withdraw money from the retirement account without incurring the 10% early-withdrawal penalty.

The "minimum coverage" issue is what has received the most attention in court cases and the media.

If you want a chance at the flashbulbs when Sofia Vergara is around, you gotta pull out the big guns. And that's what Rosario Dawson did at the White House Correspondents' Dinner Saturday night. Both guns were attached to her chest and were on full display. Unfortunately, also attached to Dawon was a hideous, shiny green skintight gown.

Even Dakota Fanning played a little peek-a-boo in a low-cut grey sequined gown with a keyhole cut-out above her waist.

The shortcomings at Village Bistro are minor. The décor could use some new touches to bring out the personality of both the restaurant and the village. Service was mostly good, but one visit during brunch took longer than it should have.
For unlike the great powers of old, we have not sought world domination. Our union was founded in resistance to oppression. We do not seek to occupy other nations.

Hornets. Chris Paul’s future is as much in play as Dwight Howard’s, and though Paul tends to get less of the spotlight, New Orleans will have to figure out what the future holds for its star point guard.

"We are turning the page on an embarrassing annual ritual known as a late state budget," said Assemblyman Bob Blumenfield, D-Woodland Hills (Los Angeles County), the chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.

Possibilities are dizzying. Sea turtles may be doomed if nesting beaches are engulfed by rising oceans. A wicked storm surge across the remnants of the Florida Keys could exterminate the last Key deer.

Sempra also is seeking approval of midsize solar arrays that could be installed at power substations, on the roofs of large warehouses, on land that is too polluted for other uses. The company would sell the electrons to apartment dwellers and customers who couldn't afford rooftop solar. It would be far more efficient than placing panels on individual roofs.

But the USDA is another matter. The virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease, a livestock illness, can persist in high pH (low acid) cheeses, according to Dr. Christopher Robinson, senior staff veterinary medical officer at the National Center for Import and Export, a branch of the USDA. So the USDA frowns on fresh ricotta and cottage cheeses from abroad because they may have high-pH whey added back to them. Also suspect are cheeses "that pour like heavy cream," says Robinson, who mentions mascarpone and Vacherin Mont-d'Or.

Home-equity lines and loans are more risky for a bank if there is a first mortgage, because the lender of the first mortgage gets paid back first if there is a foreclosure. The holder of the second mortgage comes second. At a time when home values have declined 30 percent or more in the last few years, there may not be enough value left to repay the second mortgage holder.

While I've been fortunate to travel with kids who are willing to try mixed plates, Spam musubi and other island fare, I've also had to make a McDonald's pit stop for emergency chicken nuggets. At least it was the one in Laie (next to the Polynesian Cultural Center), which sports Polynesian architecture and a couple of cultural displays inside And while the McDonald's prices here are higher than at mainland locations (for the same reason everything tends to be more expensive here — you're in the middle of the ocean), the only-in-Hawai'i menu offering rice, soy sauce, taro pie, pineapple and breakfast combos with Spam or Portuguese sausage let me file our one-time visit under "local flavor."

"It's unbelievable," said Cox, who finished with 11 points and three 3-pointers. "I used to come here all the time when I was a kid to watch people play and to get a chance to shoot the ball. ... I just let it fly and it found the bottom of the net."
Recent popular music has had its share of borrowing versus plagiarism disputes. In 1971, George Harrison released My Sweet Lord, which bore a striking resemblance to He's So Fine, recorded by the Chiffons in 1962. In 1976, Harrison was found guilty of subconscious plagiarism.

“But what I like about him is he is a true passer first, and he’s not an impatient guy that’s always looking to get outside the pocket. He will sit in there, he’ll hang tough, he can throw from a lot of different launch points, he can snap the ball off and has a strong arm and I love his mental makeup. He’s a leader, he’s tough and, most importantly, he’s smart. He picks things up quickly, and I haven’t found a person I’ve

Q: Now all the names are starting to come out. Chris Kaman says he would have chosen the Heat had he been bought out, Steve Nash saying he would strongly consider playing for Miami next year, even Jason Terry saying the same. Not to mention that Chauncey Billups could be back next season as a free agent. So many options but not so much money to go around. -- David, Fort Lauderdale.
In a strangely emotional elimination, Kaylani cries not just for leaving the show, but out of fear that she disappointed her little girl by not going further in the race. As a single mother who left her daughter to compete in a reality show, she hoped to go further, win a million dollars, and make her little girl proud. Phil Keoghan listens very intently and assures her whole-heartedly that her little girl would be very proud of her mother. Awww, Phil. No wonder your show wins so many Emmys.

"We have the opportunity to throw any six guys on the ice, two guys at a time, just rolling it over, and really not have to worry about the match-ups," Jackman said. "Everyone plays well together."
The impact of a state takeover of the district would be disastrous. Home values, already diminished in a weak market, would drop further. Attracting major new employers to the city would become even more difficult – no CEO is going to argue that their business should move to a city where the school system had to be taken over by the state. And most importantly, our students would suffer as quality staff bailed out and went elsewhere.

The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the way the treasurer was removed from office was unconstitutional. The new law would create a procedure to remove county or city officials in such cases.
The observance of the day has changed over the years to include a visit to the grave of Luxton's wife, who died of ovarian cancer. This year it includes one fewer Luxton: Tom, the younger of the two boys, who sneaked out before dawn on his 18th birthday to join the Army. So it's just Michael Luxton and his big, equally inexpressive son, Jack, who, with mixed feelings, has stayed to help his father with the farm.

One of the perks of writing this column is receiving invitations to fun events that often feature good food. Last week I had the opportunity of attending the Grand Opening of Thyme 2, chef John Kolar’s new, enlarged fine dining establishment. Mayor Dennis Hanwell and Kolar attempted to cut a white ribbon to officially open the restaurant with a huge pair of gold scissors. When the scissors refused to cooperate, Kolar produced a wicked looking chef’s knife and severed the ribbon, welcoming about 200 eager attendees.
Citing a new criminal complaint, Moscato said Giblin allegedly had audio visual equipment installed in his Jersey City condominium in 2005 at a reduced price by a vendor that had done similar work for the union fund.

The choices can include a panna cotta topped with strawberries and dices of candied fennel; and s'mores, a hot dessert in a souffle dish with a graham cracker, chocolate ganache and a gooey puff of marshmallow. The cranberry orange bread pudding with bourbon cream was too soggy for my taste, but the flavors were pleasant.

Speaking under the words of Rudyard Kipling carved into the rotunda, "Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet - lest we forget," Missouri Baptist Convention executive director John Yeats called the Obama administration a "secularist government" that had "declared war on religion and freedom of conscience."
"We looked at portfolios of a lot of college kids, and there was definitely a retro, 1950s look to a lot of them," says Butler. Smith's drawings on the other hand, were "scrappy and unhinged." Although her pencil sketches had a two-dimensional quality that did not necessarily lend itself to puppets, Butler liked that her work was based on the real world observed. "The line itself had what we came to call a nervous quality."

THE ANSWER: That is business. This product, the Boogie Board, is about aiming at something. It's a very long story. We learned a lot, and it was a success. But even if it hadn't been a success, the fact that we aimed at something matured the company in many ways. We took huge risks (as a business-to-business company launching a consumer product.) But it's going really well. I can't say the specific numbers, but I can just tell you that it's the most successful product KDI has ever done. And it's because we did something.

The 30-page report is divided into two sections. The first is a rehashing of the four workshops Reeves led with the city. The second is a list of recommendations. In that section, Reeves says the city should require at least three-color paint jobs on its downtown buildings. It should regulate awnings aggressively, she says. She calls awnings a "dark, mildewy presence on many building facades in the downtown" and says if a shop doesn't use outdoor space as an extension of its store, it should not have an awning.

Although plenty of former NFL players remain wealthy, some have made news for squandering their riches. Former defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who in 2004 signed a contract worth $36.6 million, filed for bankruptcy in March. Former Dallas receiver Raghib Ismail, former New Orleans running back Deuce McAllister, and former wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad also are among the high-profile former players who lost millions in bad investments or attempts to maintain the celebrity lifestyle many players come to know — and struggle to give up.

The circle of life, to borrow a Disney phrase. Harsh realities yield the movie’s most powerful scenes. The star of “Chimpanzee” is a baby male named Oscar, and events conspire to make him as vulnerable as he is adorable. We’ll leave the details to “Chimpanzee,” but it’s safe to say the movie ends happily, and if a child can handle “Bambi,” or “Finding Nemo,” he can handle this. n
Staying at the house were two guests, Kathleen Tynan, widow of theater critic Kenneth Tynan, and New York Review of Books cofounder Barbara Epstein. In the evening, Howard Austen, Gore's longtime companion, filled our glasses in La Rondinaia's vaulted, book-lined study, while Gore asked us to fill him in on happenings in the States. Unsurprisingly perhaps, one of the world's great talkers turned out to be a highly accomplished listener.
Looking at the team, we have a great infield all around. With Ryan Mahoney moving to third, Vinny Capone moving to second, and Jack Sexton at first our infield is one of the best in the city. The pitching suffered a bit with the loss of Jack Becker due to injury, but nonetheless seems to be headed in the right direction with the addition of arms like Steven Fondu. The lineup is stacked with hitters from top to bottom making for a tough time for any pitcher we face. I'm confident in our team’s abilities and look forward to having a great senior season.

Financial markets seem to swerve daily on speculation about what the Federal Reserve is going to do next. One day investors expect the Fed to launch a new bond-buying program to reduce long-term interest rates and boost growth. The next they expect it to raise short-term interest rates sooner than planned to restrain inflation. Investors have been all over the map.
Glassman, 22, has denied reports that she's engaged to Gosselin, even though he reportedly bought her a black diamond ring while they were vacationing together in St. Tropez earlier this month.

Of course, Tomlin's routines aren't always kid-friendly. In 2003, she told a reporter that during sketches she and her cast-mates on "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In" dialed the phone with their middle fingers, just to see if they could get the subversive act past the executives. It worked for a few weeks, she said, but censors finally caught on.

BrickTop's is a small chain with locations in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee. The Frontenac restaurant's interior is pleasant enough, with the most notable design elements a display kitchen across the back wall and a "light island" illumination of tables that adds an illusion of being more alone in the restaurant than you actually are. If you're sensitive to noise, you might want to think twice about coming here: We sat in two different corners of the dining room, and on both visits, the place was packed early in the dinner hour and the volume crested in recurring waves.

Acta and General Manager Chris Antonetti spent the off-season talking about contending and putting the best lineup on the field for every game. Damon, based on his performance last year, could help them. But he would have to do it differently.

Sandwiched between the premieres is Way's "Raking Light," set to fitful accompaniment created by Jay Cloidt. It's a piece that hasn't lost impact over the intervening years since its 1999 premiere. Thiessen, matched again with the indispensable Daniel Santos, unlocks a fierce intensity, and Zivolich and Brady find an ambiguous, yet convincing inspiration in their enigmatic central duet.

TRENTON — School districts across the state will share $8.2 million in additional federal funds to help rehire teachers laid off after last year’s record budget cuts, the Christie Administration announced today.
Ben Golliver, Blazersedge.com and CBSSports.com: At 25, it's not clear how much additional growth can be reasonably expected from his game: his struggles in transition, his limited ability to create off the dribble and his tunnel vision will almost certainly keep him from being anything better than a below-average starter. Matthews' willingness to play through injuries no matter what is his biggest asset and it makes him a fine place-holder during a roster rebuild. Matthews dipped a bit this year but he's decent. A decent two guard won't win you a playoff series when your frontcourt is as lacking as Portland's is but the dollars it would take to upgrade can be better spent on higher priorities this summer.

We could use some high-profile help here, Ben. With your power and influence you really could help bring a missing dose of liberty back to campuses. But if you only care about ID education, I suspect that you will only be preaching to people who already agree with you.

I love Shaun, if I could adopt Shaun I would, but he wouldn't block anybody, nobody and I still love him. He was one of the great runners I've ever seen, Shaun Alexander.

You don't have to do that so that's different. But, again I have great affection for Shaun Alexander and what he did for Seattle and what he did for me. This young man, different player, and there is no reason he can't do the same for us here."
