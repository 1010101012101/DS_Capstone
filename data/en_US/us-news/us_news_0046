"It's a one-day snapshot - one test, one day," she said. "A school's API score doesn't really tell us much about what's going on in each individual school. The accountability piece has to be much broader. ... The pressure to perform on that number has become an obsession."
-Make the spiral about 3 feet high and 6 feet wide. If you make it bigger, you won't be able to reach all the plants easily, and some of the plants might get too much shade. If you make it smaller, you'll compromise the ability of the stone or brick walls to warm the soil effectively.
This team is not to be underestimated. Parbhoo and his father, Bisnath, who is Trinniberg’s trainer, a few years ago bought Giant Ryan for $27,000. Last year, the horse won six straight races, including the Vosburgh. He ran seventh in the Breeders’ Cup and fifth in the big sprint in Dubai last month to wind up the year with $750,000 in the bank and the title of New York’s Horse of the Year.
Wendell Maxey: You can always count on Armon for two things: to be real with you and be ready to shoot when he gets in the game. Can't blame the guy for having a quick trigger with the mop up minutes he played for Nate McMillan to close out the season. Going forward, I think you bring Armon back. He's a good size guard with an aggressive drive for the game. The smooth lefty showed some growth signs during his stint with the Idaho Stampede and is still learning how to run a team and play the right way (read: cut down on the turnovers youngster). Besides, you have to bring Johnson back. Who else is going to come running and cheering off the bench with Patty Mills?
"I think the most important part of the job is your ability to lead and make decisions,'' said former Gophers hockey All-America Lou Nanne. "Look at the business world: You have people going from the 3M tape division to Boeing. This is essentially a business and fundraising job.''

The aquarium life-support system can be run remotely for hours on end -- with a laptop and a good Wi-Fi connection, McDill and his colleagues can monitor 10,000 data points -- but you can't beat the value of a stroll around the property. McDill crisscrosses the building's concrete bowels, checking pump housings for anomalies.

Heck, even Jane, Tarzan's prim love interest, ends up in the air when she is caught in the web of a giant spider. (Apparently, the baboon attack from the 1999 animated film wasn't quite exciting enough, so Disney took a page out of Tolkien to liven things up.)
There might be some nerves, too.

As the wave of revolution continues to sweep through the Arab world, the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad could be its next victim. While many in the United States and Israel appear hesitant to support Syria's anti-regime forces — basing their thinking on the old maxim that the devil you know is better than the one you don't — this viewpoint overlooks the major benefits both for the United States and for Israel if the Assad regime is ousted.
BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk, meanwhile, told Bloomberg TV that investors could be reacting to mobile carriers looking to cut costs, including trimming the subsidies they pay to Apple for its popular iPhone.

When the Fox network celebrates its 25th anniversary Sunday night, there's one show that probably won't get a shout-out. "Mr. President," which debuted in 1987 alongside "Married ...

"You leave the dark side at home with your wife and children and hide it from the outside world," is how Judd Apatow, the one-time teen comedy nerd who's the hottest comedy producer/director in Hollywood, put it in a 2008 interview with show-business website Zap2it.com. "You do always have to be mad about something on some level to be funny. If life is perfect for you, there's nothing to mock. All jokes are basically hostility on some level."

Such issues motivate his novels — "Little" (1995), "The Hiawatha" (1999) and "The Translation of Dr. Apelles" (2006) — which, shifting between past and present, the reservation and the city, play with our preconceptions of Indian culture, what he dismisses as "trauma porn." But with "Rez Life," Treuer likens the process more to that of writing his grandfather's eulogy, which required looking below the surface for a message, to find meaning in an inexplicable event.

Michigan State is a No. 1 seed with No. 14 charm. Its star, Draymond Green, is the best all-around player in the tournament. It was priceless to see him dribble the ball while getting instructions from Izzo in the final minutes of yesterday’s gutcheck win over St. Louis.
You can't get a pair of shoes shined (although the chap at the front desk told me there was a shoe repair place down the street that could do it "if you hurry and get there before they close"), a call to request the hotel's complimentary van service was never returned (we finally took a cab), I was charged for newspapers I'd canceled, and I couldn't get a detailed copy of my receipt. Breakfast in the Walnut Room was pricey and undistinguished.
In New Jersey, opponents of gay marriage have been calling for years for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. But to get that or any question on the ballot, they would need the Legislature to approve it. In a state controlled by Democrats, that idea's never gotten much traction. But it got a boost this week from the governor.
That northern bus line takes money that could have gone toward a rail line to Cumberland. If more funding became available, that bus line could always be turned into a train line.
I used to call this dish Confetti Beans for all the bits of color that are in it. But when we had this last week, my son renamed it, saying he wanted the "rainbow beans." We also like to play a game where he "eats his colors." He tells me he wants to eat orange, and he picks out bits of carrot. He wants to eat green, he picks out bits of zucchini.

A young Reed college graduate named Albert Gentner enlisted as an ambulance driver in World War I. "My world at present," he wrote in a letter that was eventually published in the Oregonian in 1918, "is a little dug-out about three-fourths of a mile from the front trenches. ... Life here never gets dull or monotonous, for as soon as things seem quiet a shell drops or an artillery duel begins." Gentner's grandson Stephen doggedly chronicles the man's service during the war, from boot camp through the second battle of Verdun and back to Oregon. American ambulance drivers, on average, could expect to live 14 to 33 days on the front. Gentner eked out a startling 122 days before being relieved. "Ambulance to the Front!" My Grandfather in WWI Ambulance Section SSU510" is published by Inkwater Press.

Maybe your vacuum has seen better days, or perhaps you've had a hard time figuring out whether that Swiffer is really worth the buy. (Answer: It depends on which one.) But never fear -- the Manly Housekeeper is here.
Oregon fans know what I'm talking about. Wesley is close friends with former Ducks assistant Kenny Payne. They met while Payne was a player at Louisville. And when Payne was hired by former coach Ernie Kent, it wasn't long until the talent followed to Eugene. Detroit-area blue-chipper Malik Hairston chose Oregon over Michigan. In fact. Hairston told me, "I've known Wes forever," after I saw the then-sophomore at Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals babysitting Wesley's 4-year old son in a court side seat.

"We dug too deep of a hole," Rams coach Matt Hixenbaugh said. "They came out ready to play and jumped all over us. We battled and hung around, but they're a really good team and you can't give them a cushion like we did in the first three minutes of the game."
The critical difference between Snyder and Detroit's elected officials is who wields control over city finances, operations and hiring and firing of key personnel during the brutal -- but necessary -- overhaul of the city's financial structure.

In the summer heat Laure finds it liberating not to be burdened by a shirt. It's exciting to test her strength and athletic skills against boys. It's thrilling to steal into the woods with Lisa (Jeanne Disson), a winsome brunette interested in Mikael, to taste a first kiss. For this spy in the house of gender, it's transgressive fun to escape her pink room and as Mikael to enjoy the prerogatives of boys.

Stocked generously with good domestic and imported beers, the bar has been a great addition. The cocktail program, which this season is at play with ciders, nectars and syrups, is exemplary, but the somewhat incoherent wine list could easily be rearranged to work better for the diner.

But with veteran LaDainian Tomlinson not expected to be back, the Jets still have a need at the position.

Another important element is the possibility that Oracle could persuade a federal judge to issue an injunction against Android, the Google software that has become the most widely used platform for smartphones.
I hailed his departure from MSNBC in January of 2011 because I believed with him leaving that channel, and Glenn Beck leaving Fox News, cable news TV would be a far less polarized and toxic space. The marginalization that I predicted for both, was on the money. But what a silly, silly fool I was to think cable news would get any better just because two of its most vocal and dangerous voices on the right and left were gone from their mainstream podiums.
Even then, the suit alleges, bank officials "continued to conceal the most damning information" about the tanking investments. Ciresi said in an interview that many bank e-mails and other internal documents revealing wrongdoing that were used in the first trial will again be offered in the federal case.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - A U.S. Air Force F-15E fighter crashed Thursday during a routine training mission in the Middle East, but investigators have ruled out insurgent activity as a cause, the military said. Both crew members ejected safely.
WALTER "WALT" MANNING, 62, Norfolk, Va., died Feb. 12. Wilson-Eichelberger Mortuary, Sanford.
Here were highly sophisticated conservative thinkers - lawyers and justices - making the case for limited government, and liberals weren't even prepared for the obvious constitutional question: If Congress can force the individual into a private contract by authority of the Commerce Clause, what can it not force the individual to do? Without a limiting principle, the central premise of our constitutional system - a government of enumerated powers - evaporates. What then is the limiting principle?
"I'm not crying as much now. I'm here right now, standing," she said Thursday. "Now, I will get up every time I hear a siren."

The portions are just right to leave room for some of the best desserts in the city, thanks to pastry chefs Emily Luccheti and Terri Wu. The menu description of "Eatwell Farm's Whole Wheat Flour Carrot Cake" took me back to the '70s, but it was the best dessert of the night. The crumb was moist and the cream cheese frosting had the right tang. It was served with cream cheese ice cream, a dollop of kumquat marmalade and candied pecans ($10).
Here are the Julys with the most days in which the low was at least 70 degrees.
So an appetizer of spring rolls stuffed with tasty shredded duck, napa cabbage, carrots and celery, which only needs a quick drop in the fryer, comes across very well. And the winning pheasant pot pie, which only has to be baked off until the crust turns brown, shows the kitchen's forward-looking instincts. The pheasant's wild flavor survives delicately seasoned gravy. And something that needs only minor assemblage, like the lamb meatball sub, conveys the kitchen's good grasp of flavor. The sub, a toasted ciabatta roll overstuffed with two mammoth, herby lamb meatballs and dressed with a roasted red pepper-tomato marinara, is a keeper.
This strategy, which campaign operatives call "bracketing," is not new in presidential politics — or in the 2012 race.

In a nutshell, at first, I was told I would be getting $250,000 upon maturation. As I got closer to the maturity date, I was told I would get the money that I put into the policy. I was quoted $14,400 in June of last year, about six months before the maturation date. However, my figures come to about $32,200. I have paid $44.70 every three months yearly for 15 years.
Esau met multiple times with bureau supervisors and staff in the mayor's office to discuss their proposal in April, May and June, she said. "At the last meeting we had," Esau said, "they were going to look around and find something else to work with, with less hurdles to it."

With the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and the British Open at St. Andrews this summer, the temptation was to say Woods would take down the Golden Bear's record sooner rather than later.
"Consistent with company policy, whenever we offer a voluntary leave program, Xerox reserves the right to decline participation, based on critical skills and level of participation," spokesman Bill McKee wrote in an e-mail.
Bragdon said the response could have the opposite effect. "The practical matter is that Congress is unlikely to give $400 million to something that a community strongly opposes," he said. "And that's where this is heading now."
This historical work has been brought into the modern era with the acquisition of two local collections. One features Ukiyo-e woodcuts by Hokusai, Hiroshige and other artists. The second focuses on Nihonga, the traditional Japanese-style painting done during and after the Meiji era, in conservative resistance to Western influences.
Spiro, the Temple University immigration expert, said the court easily could have passed on the Arizona case for now. "They could have waited for the more extreme case to come from Alabama, which really outflanked the Arizona law," Spiro said.
Officials are just as resolute. They say they worry about the welfare of residents, citing floods each spring and a recent fire that burned a dozen shacks but miraculously killed no one. The new units, they say, will mean a better life.
Syracuse fell to Cincinnati in the Big East semifinals on Friday; Kentucky lost to Vanderbilt in the Southeastern Conference title game, and the Tar Heels lost to Florida State in the ACC finals Sunday.

Contrived candids, the pictures draw upon character types from films of the '50s and '60s — career girl, wholesome youth, boozy vamp, jilted lover, bohemian, housewife (both sexy and stressed). Sherman oscillates from prim to sultry, cute to crazed. Here she leans confidently against the brick wall of the Flagstaff train depot, there she cries before an empty martini glass. In one photograph she stands expectantly by the side of a road, full of promise, and in another, she self-destructs in a housecoat on basement stairs. The images exert the emotional tug of the familiar and vaguely nostalgic. They feel coy and clever but also appealingly earnest in a way never revisited in Sherman's later work, which grows increasingly confrontational.

A sentencing hearing for Turner is scheduled for May.
If a left tackle who is an excellent value is available at 19, I'd have no problem if the Bears selected him. I don't suspect that will be the case, however. There probably are three offensive tackles worth taking that high -- Matt Kalil of Southern Cal, Riley Reiff of Iowa and Jonathan Martin of Stanford. My hunch is all three will be off the board by the time the Bears pick, and better values will be available at other positions. The Bears' swing tackle in 2012 very well could be Chris Williams, or, if Williams wins a starting offensive tackle job, the swing tackle could be Webb. Either way, at this point it looks like Williams is moving back to tackle.
But the one thing that must happen: Business leaders must make fixing schools and reducing violent crime a top priority - even if that means reducing the latest and greatest tax incentives for their businesses. It must be more important than anti-worker proposals that increase profits. It will take a regional coalition to make this happen.

It didn't look like a village at all. We were ushered into a 50-square-yard collection of shacks where two dozen Padaung women sat and sewed or tried to sell their wares. There were no men in sight and only a handful of tourists during my two-hour visit.
She founded the all-volunteer museum more than 20 years ago at a time when surfers were seen as more of a nuisance than athletes. The museum has been collecting surfing artifacts, memorabilia, photos and videos from all over the world to pay tribute to the sport.
During the suit’s discovery phase, Bolton’s lawyers learned Vargas, now 33, was one of two officers on the scene that night to have received steroids or growth hormone from Colao. The other is Stise, the officer who was just 26 when Lowen’s sent him drugs.

"There were people who came in specifically to use the Amex card." She more than doubled the total amount of her normal Amex sales - from $850 to $2000.
The European Central Bank could try to thwart that by issuing unlimited loans to banks. It has done that already, handing out more than (EURO)1 trillion in December and February. That calmed the crisis for a few weeks.

If your filling recipe calls for a pre-baked shell, line the pastry with a piece of aluminum foil, shiny-side down. Fill with dried beans, rice or pie weights. Bake in a preheated 425 oven for 15 minutes; remove the foil and beans. Return the pie shell to the oven and bake 10-15 minutes longer, rotating the pan a couple of times, until evenly browned.

He justified killing his wife at that time by claiming she was addicted to marijuana and wine coolers and said she sometimes attacked him, once breaking his arm and another time hitting him over the head with a ball bat. "She was tired of living," he said in a 1991 court appearance. Richardson turned to his wife's family and said, "I hope you enjoy the insurance money."
"It was a physical match ... it was one of the best matches I played. Emotionally and mentally it was equally hard."
Putin's decision not to go to the G-8 summit — instead sending his predecessor and now prime minister Dmitry Medvedev — was explained as necessary for Putin to form his Cabinet. That raised eyebrow since Putin's return to the presidency had been all but certain since he announced his intention to run last September. Some observers suggested it gave Putin a convenient excuse to avoid a highly visible international forum where his tough line against dissent could come under criticism.
Some would argue that flogging isn't harsh enough. While this moves beyond the facile belief that flogging is too cruel to consider, if flogging shouldn't be offered because it's too soft -- if we need to keep people locked up precisely because overcrowded jails and prisons are so unbelievably horrific -- then perhaps we need to question our humanity.
With a Constellation merger seemingly imminent, will we forget Irene? BGE/Constellation has no real competition, and there seems no lack of funds in their government-regulated revenue coffers. These factors sow the seeds for their failure of responsibility and their lack of effective sensitivity to our needs.
"You have a strangling, rape and murder of a single woman," Joffe said. "You would think that would ring a bell. I sure wish to hell it had."
Politically, a ruling against Husted would likely be raised by his opponents during the 2010 campaign. In 2006, a similar residency complaint was filed against then Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ted Strickland. His rival, Republican Ken Blackwell, characterized honesty about where one lives as "an issue of overall integrity." The complaint was ultimately dropped.
"Our perception is very different from the study," said Ray, who says quality of life in Hough is better than many outsiders think.

Even before the IPO window reopened, venture firms were shifting dollars away from fledgling technology startups in favor of companies with a better chance of going public soon, according to the MoneyTree report.

Yes, you can minimize the risk to your comfort level - buying travel insurance, booking large tour groups with a well-bonded guide, avoiding dodgy street food. But at some point you have to wonder: Did you experience that city, or just look at it, as if seeing highlights on a Viewmaster picture wheel?
"It's really aimed at the war of perceptions," she said. "You try to start the fighting season with a bang and wipe away the claims that the Taliban haven't been able to pull off their major offensive. It's much more symbolic than tactical."
The Obama administration filed suit today against Arizona's landmark immigration law, alleging it was unconstitutional and a U.S. District Court judge should keep it from going into effect July 29.
As has been described to me, it seems Casiraghi — hey, this guy dates the descendant of an actual saint! — wanted to sit at the owner’s table at club Double Seven. Trouble was, the table was already occupied by the equivalent of the club set’s unwashed 99 percent.

Raymond Felton had another awful game, finishing with nine points, five turnovers and three assists, while making 2 of 10 shots. During the forgettable first quarter, Felton was 0 for 3 from the field, and had three turnovers and zero assists. ...

Harris gained invaluable performance experience while studying music at Humboldt State, where she led an award-winning vocal octet. But it was her stint at Boston's Berklee College of Music in the mid-'90s that turned her into a masterful interpreter of ballads. Just when her career should have taken off, Harris hit a long stretch of the doldrums, and it wasn't until she returned to the Bay Area in 2005 that she found her way back to music, via her mother's intervention.

There are, doubtless, more searching, scholarly books about the country's modern history. But "Exodus," a historical novel about how a handful of Jewish pioneers started arriving in the Holy Land in the 19th century, put the Palestinian desert under cultivation and built leafy, graceful cities in the sand dunes, was just right for me.
Venison burgers: Ohio deer hunters parlayed 104,400 pounds of venison into 417,600 meals for Ohio food banks this year. Sportsmen donated 2,088 deer they killed to the Farmers and Hunters Feed the Hungry program, which processed the venison for free.

Ausby's outburst was one of several emotional eruptions in court Wednesday, following opening statements in the high-profile case, which has highlighted tensions between some black and Jewish residents in the Park Heights area of Northwest Baltimore. It has also drawn comparisons nationwide to the recent killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot down by a Hispanic resident while walking through the man's gated Florida community. Ausby is black, while the Werdesheims are white.

Truth is, the vocalist used to be above that kind of thing. As one of the four iconoclastic emcees in Goodie Mob, his pre-Gnarls Barkley outfit, he was one of Atlanta’s most consistently interesting lyricists, and one who always articulated an offbeat perspective. Goodie Mob never sold many records, and I understand if Cee-Lo got tired of bouncing checks. We can forgive him his enthusiasm for contemporary marketing trends. His bandwagon-riding is a little tougher to pardon. “Forget You” may mark the moment when a once-great rapper began his final descent into novelty singing.
While the tour is restricted to the kitchen, that doesn't make a visit any less desirable. Guests will enter through double doors leading to a small, hand-painted entryway.

Diners are free to accept or reject it. It's a similar argument that hounds just about every cutting-edge artist. One person might love the abstract work of Mark Rothko, while another will think it borders on trash. But that kind of controversy should be expected when food becomes art.

If intimacy and dining go hand in hand, it doesn't get more intimate than Yamo in the Mission District, where patrons rub elbows at the tiny, counter-only Burmese restaurant. The food fuses the tastes of India and China in dishes like spiced fried rice and wok-tossed noodles with curry, both specialties at Yamo. The place is family run and owned, and the food is made a la minute. That can mean a wait, as the orders pile up and two cooks hover furiously over the tiny stove, but the owner and customers seem happy to socialize.

But kind of more to your point, I don't know if there will ever be another follow-up to this. This kind of is just the airing it all out and getting it all on the record and telling it like it was. It forces you to think about the past maybe more than you want to and it forces you to think about the future even more, which is something I've always enjoyed immensely.

Israel, for example, could announce that it would be willing to return the entire Golan Heights — providing Israel's security and water concerns were taken into consideration — to a Syrian regime that was genuinely democratic, if that regime signed a peace treaty with Israel incorporating trade, tourism and diplomatic relations. (As former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir once said, "I will know that there is a real peace with Syria when I can go shopping in Damascus.") To be sure, many Israelis, remembering Syrian forces firing down on the Galilee from the Golan Heights before the 1967 war, would be loathe to give up the Golan. Nonetheless, the security benefits to Israel of a Syria that has broken its ties with Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas would be well worth the return of the Golan.

Other sections of "The Iron Lady" find her in the fullness of her influence, or, more interesting still, en route to political power as a younger woman with a growing sense of her own destiny. But Abi Morgan's time-hopping patchwork of a script takes a blandly nonpartisan approach to one of the most controversial, as well as influential, politicians in British history. And moments of genuine poignancy, having to do with memories of love and the ravages of age, are diluted by the director's penchant for cinematic effects that play like repurposed Fellini. If only the film as a whole deserved the brilliance of its star.

Dear P.T.: There are so many themes and so many decades recalled for spring that no one saying is appropriate. But to me the most interesting new clothes for someone your age combine disparate elements. To borrow the slogan of The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, these are the clothes that have "just the right amount of wrong." Examples: A fur jacket with shorts and biker boots, a nylon bomber jacket with a fancy tulle skirt and unlaced tennis shoes, a classic cashmere sweater with knee-length sequined skirt over jeans stuffed into hiking boots.

Most driveway experts will back you up on at least one point – that sealing every year is excessive. Even many sealing professionals and seal-coat manufacturers agree on that point. Sealing every year can actually lead to problems, including seal-coat peeling and cracking. However, letting your driveway go unsealed for five years might also be excessive, especially if it has turned gray and is developing small cracks. There is some controversy about how often an asphalt (blacktop) driveway should be sealed, but every three years appears to strike a good balance. When an asphalt driveway turns gray, it indicates oxidation of the asphalt and weathering by sun, rain and freezing. A coat of sealer should be helpful. The small cracks are another sign that the asphalt is having problems. If the cracks are larger than hairline, fill them with top-quality crack filler before sealing. Picking good crack fillers can also be difficult. In general, avoid cheap products – they won't last more than a year or so. Most dealers sell professional-grade fillers that cost more, but will usually last a lot longer. Very tiny (hairline) cracks can be filled by the sealer; many sealers contain sand-like filler material that will close them. Before sealing, clean the driveway as thoroughly as possible. Use a blower or scraper to remove all debris and dirt. Finally, whether you seal the driveway or hire a pro, make sure a top-quality sealer is used.

The economic ironies are also, well, rich. Mr. Obama is now pushing to reduce the payroll tax by two-percentage points for another year to boost the economy, but he's already built in a big increase in that same payroll tax for 2013. So if a payroll tax cut creates jobs this year, why doesn't a payroll tax increase destroy jobs after 2013?

Studies show that first and second generation immigrants favor making English the official language of the United States — and that they do so, in fact, at a higher rate than the general American population. If opposition to illegal immigration were what the Official English movement is about, surely this would not be the case. People come to America with the expectation that we speak English here and that they need to learn English in order to be successful.
