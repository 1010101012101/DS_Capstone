The once-inaccessible Cambodian countryside, with its lime-green rice paddies, jungly mountains, swollen lakes and rushing rivers, increasingly is opening, thanks to adventure travel agencies that take visitors there by horse, motorcycle and helicopter.

"I was having a terrible time with it at first," she continues, "because I didn't want to talk about Quintana for a lot of reasons. I didn't want to talk about her because I didn't want to talk about her. And the second reason was I didn't know if I had the right to talk about her. It was her life, not mine. So that got in the way for a long time." What's at issue here, in an apartment full of family photos and mementos, is permission, or maybe it's that, after all this time, Didion has become the reporter who triangulates herself. That's the challenge, and the risk, of memoir, and if she has always been a personal writer, with her last three books — "Blue Nights," "The Year of Magical Thinking" and 2003's "Where I Was From," which she thinks of as "the California book" — she has shifted focus, in large measure, from the outer to the inner world.
"If you want people to go along with this, they have to know what they are voting on," he added.
There’s something to be said for this approach — nothing is uglier than violence presented prettily — but it also feels sadistic itself. Winterbottom, whose infamous “9 Songs” featured its stars actually having sex on camera, seems a little too eager to provoke. See? See?

But there are a couple of helpful exceptions to Oregon law, says Gasperini.
But perhaps readers simply need something beyond imagination and analysis: the will to believe in their own reading. I'm reminded of the ghost in "Hamlet," and how little we really know about him. Is the story he tells Hamlet -- that he is the spirit of his murdered father and should be avenged -- true? Is he a hellish apparition sent to lure Hamlet to commit an "unnatural murder" of his own? Or is he just a figment of Hamlet's imagination? No one really knows, and that's part of the fun. It's a very different play depending on which view you take.

I don't do this often enough, and I probably should. (Then again, the truly curious could write them down themselves from online postgame reports.) For the uninitiated, plus-minus is, much as it is in hockey, the comparison of the points a team scored with a certain player on the court relative to the points it allows. Small differences don't mean much; a guy can throw in a three or miss the front end of a one-and-one while you're on the court and one player may have had no connection with -- or responsibility -- for that play. But obviously, over the course of games, the guys doing best should have the biggest difference. But, as always, don't get hung up on one person being one or two points better than someone else.

I tried to keep the office at arm's length by using only my wife's computer, the one without the link-up to the Register computer system. But when you are at home, you are never away. And it was too easy to pick up a phone, to send an e-mail, to check the design of a page on my work computer, to get a little headache from the bank statements that would have remained unread for a week. With a staycation, the stay often overwhelms the "cation."

The traditional Catholic universities — Seton Hall, Villanova, Georgetown, Marquette, DePaul, St. John’s and Providence — could be left in limbo if the league begins breaking apart along football lines. However two people with knowledge of those schools’ line of thinking said that the Catholic universities would stick together to hold the league intact and potentially reform as a basketball-only conference. The individuals, who requested anonymity because they did not want to speak publicly for the other universities, said that they could foresee adding other high-profile, basketball-only programs to round out the league.

Now, I don't expect it to be a close game on Saturday. Not even a little bit, and not even in the beginning. I think Missouri State will be incredibly overwhelmed and (let's be honest) probably a little intimidated by Autzen, as many other teams have been. It should be a blowout from start to finish. John Canzano said last night on Twitter that it might very well be 69-0. Yawn. That sounds like a boring game to me. I'm sure Missouri State isn't thrilled by the prospect either, and is probably still recovering from the 51-7 loss at Arkansas. But with a $440,000 check, at least they'll eat a good postgame meal.

Stanford (12-2, 2-0) received some votes in this week’s AP poll, ranking 28th in the nation (Cal comes in at 39th). But the Cardinal is 6-21 in conference road games since 2008-09 and lost two of three to Oregon State last season.
Whitney first distinguished herself as a singer at New Hope, and always said that devotionals were her favorite songs to sing. In concert, her church training frequently surfaced — gospel soul would ooze into even her most secular, strait-laced performances. Even on her last tour, Houston included spiritual music in her set lists. It is indisputable that she could have been one of the greatest gospel voices in history if she had wanted to be.
Golder said that there were two cases where department representatives were not allowed on the property and they had to return with an administrative order. He said he's gotten calls from all over the world from people thinking they are shooting all the heritage swine in the state.
Measuring CSA prices is difficult. Programs that cost $300 to $600 a season may deliver 5 to 15 pounds of produce a week. But many different foods of different weights are offered. Weather can change the size of a harvest. Conventional market prices vary. And farmers, say some CSA members, can be instantly generous with extra product.
"I knew all these people and they knew all about me, because I was writing about them," Ambrose said. "They were so appreciative that someone was going to do this, because they knew they couldn't."
President Barack Obama's struggles with a conservative Supreme Court are an old American story. In "FDR and Chief Justice Hughes," author James F. Simon recounts Franklin D.

A new group of filmmakers appeared on the scene. However, these guys were "little schmucks." (Many people were "little schmucks" in Harvey's world.) The filmmakers slept at Harvey's apartment.

2. The new West favorites: It's hard to wrap your mind around the fact that the three Western Conference teams still alive are the Thunder, Grizzlies and Mavericks.
• The Knicks lost while their next opponent, the Boston Celtics, got a win and some more rest, wrote Ian Begley of ESPNNewYork.com: "The Celtics beat the Bobcats on Sunday night, on a night when Doc Rivers decided to pull a Gregg Popovich and rested Boston's Big Three. The Celtics' win gave them a 4½-game cushion over the Knicks for first place in the Atlantic Division with just six games to go... Mike Woodson has said again and again that his team's goal is to win the division. They can be mathematically eliminated from that pursuit if they don't beat the Celtics on Tuesday."

France's U.N. Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert, whose country sponsored both resolutions, stressed the council's backing for U.N. envoy Olusegun Obasanjo's efforts to get Nkunda's rebels and the government to formalize a cease-fire and discuss a peace process. He said the council was also delivering a message to all armed groups to implement the peace agreements they signed – and a warning that the international community intends to fight against illicit exploitation of natural resources which fuel and prolong conflict.

The goal of the crew is to get the players in and out of the set as quickly as possible. Holliday breezed through his spot. Freese's group with the confetti nailed a couple of the segments with one take. Schumaker's took a little bit longer because who puts on a jousting gauntlet with a straight face on the first try?

Ripken: Yeah, but what people tell me about 50 is they look at it in reference to their whole life, and 50 kind of might be the halfway point. Up until 50 you're not thinking about the end of your life, and then at 50 you're starting to think about the downhill side. I don't know if that's true or not because I haven't felt it personally, but if I look at it in my baseball thing, I remember thinking much more at 30 the unknown about how much more you are going to play. You've been playing for a while, and it seems like you look at everybody else's history. As you said, Brooks Robinson played a long time, and I'm thinking, "OK, this is probably the halfway point," and you start to have doubts about the end of it. You didn't know when it was going to end. Forty, to me that was kind of easy because you're glad to be playing baseball when you're 40 and you know it's at the end, so there weren't any surprises. Maybe you get started later in life, in business later on in life, so my 50 might be someone else's 40 or someone else's 30. I'm not sure.

Cash eases the transaction, eliminating the hassle of a mortgage or the threat of an appraisal killing the deal. For some buyers, left nauseous by the roller-coaster stock market, a bargain-priced house seems like a more stable investment, or a way to diversify.
When you look carefully at the surrounding circumstances, you realize that Mr. Henson was merely the political consultant in the case and the Ehrlich camp was the ultimate responsible party. So why were neither the campaign office, nor the offices or homes ofRobert L. Ehrlich Jr., Paul Schurick or Ehrlich aide Greg Massoni raided like Mr. Henson's or Ms. Russell's were? They were the only black folks involved in the case. In fact, no federal charges were ever brought against Mr. Schurick (who was later found guilty in state court) or former Governor Ehrlich. Yet the attorney general has brought forth a ridiculous $168 million civil case against both Ms. Russell and Mr. Henson.

He is hardly unique. The Nazis have become the go-to image of political demonization. We've seen Barack Obama as Hitler and George W. Bush as Hitler. But anyone who understands what happened when Hitler was Hitler cannot help but decry such a monumental trivialization of atrocity. The crimes of the Nazi regime were singular, unprecedented in their sheer awfulness. Because of this, thoughtful observers draw Nazi parallels carefully and rarely if at all.

Every other special-interest group has a lobbyist, a ribbon, a task force, a rallying cry or, at the very least, the sheltering arms of the political-correctness police.

5. Melvin Ingram, DE/OLB, South Carolina, 6-1, 264. He is the just-play-him-somewhere guy on this board with his elite athleticism.

That said, Time’s cover story -- which manages to disappoint from the cover line onward -- gets a little too excited about the threat of giant children. "There is no way to overestimate how scary numbers like this are," a scientist tells journalist Jeffrey Kluger. Um, actually there is -- and there are reasons to wonder whether some programs, such as weighing kids at school and sending them home with "fitness report cards," might do more harm than good.

If we want jobs in America, and the purchasing power that goes along with those jobs, we need to "care" and provide for our workers. The alternative is to condemn workers to a life of poverty from medical bills, or to ship the jobs to China where near-slave-labor conditions prevail and employers here won't have to be concerned with well-being of their "contracted" employees.
