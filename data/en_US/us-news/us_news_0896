Advertise: Though a sign in the car window may attract some attention, print and online advertising will get the word out more effectively. Choices range from The Plain Dealer's classified section to free sites such as Craigslist.

On the paid sites and publications, they said they had to price the vehicles more realistically to avoid paying to keep ads running.

Santana and Villaraigosa want city workers to shoulder some of the responsibility for pulling the government out of this crisis. If unions are willing to forgo raises, cuts will not be as deep. Labor should urge its members to make those sacrifices, as painful as they will be, to save jobs and protect everyone who relies on Los Angeles government. Taxpayers should do their part too: The package proposed by Santana and his staff includes a doubling of the city documentary transfer tax, a levy imposed on home sales. Although those hikes would not take effect in time to help much, it's a worthy idea and one that would help shield some services from cuts.

What's more, Wolfe called TSP's G-fund "maybe the best bond-fund deal in existence. I only wish I had access to it for my own portfolio." It's like a stable value fund you might find in a 401(k) plan or the Principal Protection Portfolio in the Oregon College Savings Plan.

There are hints passed from pirate to Darwin about this new idea, evolution, which he never picks up on.

We spent most of our time there on the very technical circuit that has a lot of fast corners which allowed the ZL1 to breathe. Its 6.2-liter, 558-horsepower SC V8 engine is ridiculously fast.

AFC NORTH: If there was a winner to the draft, it might be Cincinnati. The Bengals got two good players who fill major needs in the first round, CB Dre Kirkpatrick and G Kevin Zeitler. Then got “droppers’’ DE Devon Still and WR Mohamed Sanu in the second and third. Pittsburgh, no surprise, also did very well. The Steelers may have rebuilt an offensive line that needed it with G David DeCastro in the first and T Mike Adams in the second. Baltimore is going to have to figure out how to use DE/LB Courtney Upshaw to make that pick work. Cleveland bought the Vikings’ bait, instead of calling their bluff and traded from No. 4 to No. 3 for Trent Richardson. But Brandon Weeden? Oh yeah that’s right Tom Heckert is the GM in Cleveland.

Trading down is risky, but it can work if you don't trade down very far. For example, if the players ranked No. 25 through No. 38 on the draft board have similar grades, it might make sense to trade down to select the 38th-ranked player. But you need to acquire more picks in return for making that move.

They've put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into this program."

Also in 2003, a state investigation of a riot at MTC's Eagle Mountain prison in California, in which two inmates were beaten to death, cited lack of staffing and training. Dozens of officers from nearby state prisons had to be called in to help end the 90-minute riot. Arnita said the prison was fully staffed at the time but staff had no access to weapons because California's Department of Corrections limited armory access to CDC officers, who weren't present when the riot began.

And that philosophy is also part of Williams' football DNA. It's a football DNA that Fisher and Williams share.

The job is changing rapidly even as the number of jobs dwindles. That said, it can be argued that baseball writing and coverage has never been better. To that end, this season in the daily 10s I'd like to offer up one story – often, a game story, a dying breed on its own – that is worth reading.

Given the fact that 53 Democratic Senators and two independents have already sent him a letter saying they would not pass his two-step debt limit increase plan, and that President Obama have already promised to veto it, Mr. Boehner knew before today's efforts that jamming his bill through the House with no Democratic support is unlikely to work.

These lists usually include the name of the list's owner and his or her city and state.

Gary Kubiak, despite another lackluster season that ended without a playoff berth, but defensive coordinator Frank Bush, secondary coach David Gibbs, linebackers coach Johnny Holland and assistant linebackers coach Robert Saleh were fired.

And Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver said coach Jack Del Rio's job is safe despite the team losing its final 3 games as it blew a chance to win the AFC South title.

Gov. Jon Corzine put the LSRP program into play with a May directive, contending the use of private engineers to handle and watch over toxic cleanups could move along thousands of state-monitored projects delayed partly because of understaffing at the state Department of Environmental Protection.

Marriage can pose a lot of challenges: financial worries, in-law issues, child-rearing difficulties, and the problems involved in simply growing older. I believe if you want a faithful spouse, it isn't enough to have someone who's faithful because he/she loves you. You have to find someone who believes in marital fidelity. This is the person who will stay faithful, even when marital difficulties give rise to the temptation to cheat.
Republicans aren't the only ones to make dubious choices. Sen. George McGovern's selection of Sen. Thomas Eagleton, who not longer after his selection resigned from the ticket when it was revealed that he'd received shock therapy for depression, no doubt contributed to Mr. McGovern's landslide defeat in 1972 (although it was hardly the only mistake the candidate made).

Washington state is promenading down a controversial aisle that's familiar to Californians after its Senate approved a bill last week legalizing same-sex marriage. The lower house and the governor are expected to approve the bill as well. But such civil rights victories can be fleeting, as Californians learned after a court decision legalizing gay marriage was overturned by Proposition 8 in 2008. A similar battle is looming in Washington, where opponents plan to gather signatures for a November ballot initiative declaring marriage to be reserved for opposite-sex couples only.

Everything about Level works well. If you get the feeling that there might be something missing — say, a compelling vision that goes beyond well-wrought comfort food — the nice exchange is that you spend your time focused on your friends and not on the restaurant's mission.

She walks at a brisk pace from her home in Bronxville, N.Y. to the train station and then from Grand Central Station to her office in Manhattan's Flatiron District. When Ms. Moore goes on the road with the company when they tour, she tries to walk around the city she's visiting or will use the treadmill at the hotel gym.

So, where does Planck get it wrong? "[Planck] insists that certain nutrients like vitamins A and D, omega-3 fats and carnitine are available only from animal foods," says Messina, "That's not true for any of these nutrients. We humans easily convert beta-carotene in plant foods to vitamin A. As little as one-quarter cup of carrot juice or a half-cup of sweet potatoes provides a day's worth of this nutrient. Meat eaters have no advantage regarding vitamin D either. Because there is so little naturally occurring vitamin D in foods, nearly all Americans -- vegans and omnivores alike -- get it from supplements, fortified foods or sun exposure."

Lovely. Except the tariff - 420 euros, or about $550 - is still more than 320 percent higher than a futures bottle of the 2008 cost. That does not represent a meaningful increase in value.

If you are planning to go to a WWE event, do your part in making the show enjoyable and get involved. Nobody – not the superstars performing, not the crowd in the arena, not those watching at home – appreciates silence.

I realize this is a complicated subject matter, but the Internet sometimes has a way of oversimplfying things. My article became a straw man for homophobia and hurt in the world. If you were pro-gay, you were anti-NEWSWEEK. Chenoweth's argument that gay youth need gay role models is true, but that's not what I was talking about.

But I was hoping to start a dialogue that would be thoughtful-not to become a target for people who twisted my words. I'm not a conservative writer with an antigay agenda. I don't hate gay people or myself. As for my haircut, I don't know what to say. Should I change it?

Bynum quickly passed out of double teams to ensure fluid ball movement, helping the starting lineup and Jordan Hill to post double figures. Bynum's help in the lane contributed to Ramon Sessions' holding Denver guard Ty Lawson to seven points.

More than 14,000 people were discharged under the 1993 Clinton-era law. President Barack Obama campaigned on the law's repeal, but efforts stalled in Congress until a federal judge in California last year declared it unconstitutional and briefly blocked its enforcement.

Obama certified in July that repeal would not harm the military's ability to fight.

Scottish Daily Record: "MYSTERY writer Edgar Allan Poe terrified readers with tales of drawn-out torture.

Parachuting into a cemetery, he ran to a creek and was able to douse the flames. After spending a few weeks in a hospital, he returned to combat and was shot down again June 12, 1942. Despite head injuries -- and shrapnel that he carried in his head the rest of his life -- he was back in action a week later.
It was the season opener for both teams.
So the Bears were right in not caving in to his demands, but what happened Sunday was the inherent gamble in that stance: Without the contract he wants, Forte has no reason to play hurt. Players with sprained MCLs usually are out two to four weeks.

"Why don't you take them?" Betty asks, noting that Pauline's on the generously proportioned side herself. But Betty goes to the doctor to ask for diet pills. They may not be the exact pills suggested in the 1966 Rolling Stones song, "Mother's Little Helper," but they're on the same track. The mothers who went running for the shelter of pills to get them through their busy day had quite a selection in the mid-'60s. Diet pills, which got you nervous, so then you'd need something to calm you down, and maybe some sleeping pills while you were at it, and then something to give you a lift the next morning. There were plenty of doctors who viewed their job as dispensing various wonder drugs to help women cope. Until the pills became a bigger problem than what they were supposed to remedy.
Peggy and Stan, the snarky art director, are trying to land Heinz, and pitch a campaign for beans that would feature special effects to create "a bean ballet." This is too arty and irrelevant for the Heinz people. "Where's the bite and smile?" And more to the point, they want their beans to be relevant. They want to appeal to the new generation of consumers, and update beans' image. Beans are the war, the Depression and bomb shelters, says a Heinz exec. They want to sell to the college kids with their hot plates and sit-ins. Peggy, frustrated, looks to Don to back her up. He sides with the Heinz men, reassuring them that they can deliver what they want: "This is a process." Peggy later says this isn't the Don she knows. He's kind and patient. "It concerns me."

As a young pastor, I was astonished by the responses from older folks as I read Psalm 23 during a funeral service. We'd drive to the cemetery, where a student from the high school band would be warming up "Taps." Volunteers from the American Legion would be lined up in tribute. Gathered under a hot canvas awning, the family would watch as I would begin to intone those family words:
“I had a conversation with a guy at work today, and he had a good point there. Concerning the politicians and the election candidates out there, especially the president, I feel they should have to sign a contract. When they say that they’re going to do this or that, they should have to sign a paper stating that if they don’t perform well — I mean, most employers out there, if the employees don’t do their job, they lose their job. I feel the candidates out there should sign a paper, too.”

Years after Pendarves died, Mary's passionate life began with an Irish clergyman named Delany. But it was not until his death, after years of suffering, that she began creating the startling paper collages, intricate mosaics — flowers cut from paper, thousands of them, that now survive her in the British Museum and in books. Molly Peacock discovered Mary after an exhibit of her work at the Morgan Library in New York. She became a role model for Peacock, a way to understand her own life and a way to grow old with dignity. This book layers Delany's life and work over Peacock's. It is organized by flower — forget-me-not, thistle, poppy, etc., each a metaphor for a different phase in Delany's life. In this way, the book itself is a complicated, delicate and beautiful collage. "If a role model in her seventies isn't layered with contradictions," Peacock writes, "as we all come to be — then what good is she? Why bother to cut the silhouette of another's existence and place it against our own if it isn't as incongruous, ambiguous, inconsistent, and paradoxical as our own lives are?"

In a mega-quake, many of the region's iconic tall buildings would probably collapse.
