One funny, early sequence has Poe (played energetically by John Cusack) cussing out an editor at a Baltimore paper who’d replaced his Longfellow screed with one of Longfellow’s own poems. This hurt’s Poe’s pride, and his pocketbook — the destitute Poe never made more than a few dollars from his poems or his fiction, not nearly enough to fund his prodigious liquor bills.

One night, I woke and saw my father standing on a stool, pouring water into the barrel to replace the water that had evaporated. Throughout the night and into the morning, he repeated this act like a shepherd tending his flock. I'm not sure if he saw me, but it always felt like he was doing something important.

A: I can't make a recommendation now, since none of these tablets is out. However, I can make a few observations. Even on the current iPad, you can annotate files and take written notes in various apps. But the iPad isn't designed at heart for freehand note-taking and annotation, and you'd have to buy an add-on stylus. Some Android devices—even without Ice Cream Sandwich—have integrated note-taking and the stylus as a core feature. The latest is the Samsung Galaxy Note, a ginormous phone that is really a small tablet. As for Windows 8, it is designed to run the full version of Office. And the preview device Microsoft has supports handwriting and has a stylus in the box.

MVP — This is easy. Winter Park WR/LB Dvario Montgomery (6-3, 195) was, hands down, the top player. It seemed he was drawing oohs and aahs after every play he made. One fan from opposing Melbourne Viera High during a game on Saturday hollered at Montgomery and said, "You got a big future in football." The rising junior made so many catches in traffic that it was disappointing if he ever failed to connect. He's a big target at 6 feet 3, 195 pounds and is very athletic.

"Sweet potatoes. I hated them at Thanksgiving. But after changing my eating habits 1 1/2 years ago, they were suggested in a recipe. They are really good and healthy for you.

Yet that's what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — which has previously taken tentative steps to curb the agricultural use of antibiotics and is under a judge's order to carry out existing laws that call for limiting the overuse of two classes of antibiotics — is proposing. Obviously, the agency wants to avoid a protracted legal battle with producers, and its authority is limited by Congress' repeated refusal to act. But this latest plan falls far short of the decisive action needed to make a difference.

I believe that everyone is called by God into a unique way of being--vocation isn't only for priests, nuns, and wizards! And I believe that God is even more persistent, even more creative, even more committed to his people than Professor Dumbledore, or any other character our imaginations can dream up. And, now that I am living into my own callings, as a priest and a mother and a wife and a writer, I know something else: I no longer want to go to Hogwarts, or stumble through a wardrobe into another world. I love doing what I'm called to do, day by day, imperfectly, without the benefit of magic.

One problem that I occasionally find with lag screws is that they're not attached to anything substantial behind the ledger. When a home is constructed with floor trusses and there is no rim joist for the deck to attach to, it's important to figure out what the screws are going in to.

You wouldn't want to put too many people on that deck.

The yeast he used for the Clockspring Vineyard zinfandel was chosen to emphasize fruit flavors and to enhance the wine's texture, while the yeast for the 17 Acre is the same used to make hefeweizen beer, which he selected to enhance the suggestion of cloves in the wine's finish. It's got that, all right, but for overall impact and grace I prefer the Clockspring.
The story caused an uproar. But no one in the Legislature tried to ban questions about voting. Nor should they have. Not every little hubbub requires a new law. And, frankly, the notion of gun owners being so fearful of a question that they need government to block their tender ears is laughable.

The quarter horses Brent raised and trained were like children to him. He says he cannot understand how or why anyone could kill such innocent creatures. Well, whoever did it obviously thought he or she was making a point about Brent's sexual orientation. That because of who they thought he was, his horses deserved to die, shrieking in fear, panic and pain, as the smoke and fire ran through the barn. That because they thought Brent is a gay man, that his horses should be killed to make a statement about homosexuals -- just in case Brent didn't read the message on the side of the barn.

Robertson calls Vienna, which has streets named for composers and statues of them on street corners, "a magical, musical city. The people who made their home there, the composers who sprung up there, the music that made its way around the world - from the Strauss family, to Mahler, to theater music - it's a place that has literally changed the history of music. We're exploring lots of different facets of that, with pieces from Vienna, pieces connected to Vienna, pieces you couldn't imagine existing if it weren't for Vienna as musical magnet."

He switched focus after a student gig assisting artist Matthew Barney in New York. If it hadn't been for that, Mercier would probably be designing rather fabulous car doors, he said. With Barney, Mercier said, "I discovered that ambition in man wasn't necessarily something disgusting, linked to power and money, but that ambition could simply be a magnificent energy, the energy of an artist, in fact, to create.

"Pan Am" (10-11 p.m. ABC): Under the spell of "Mad Men," the networks are launching two dramas set in the 1960s. This is easily the more high-flying of the two, which is not to say it soars into the ranks of the best new dramas. Christina Ricci, Kelli Garner, Karine Vanasse and Margot Robbie play airline stewardesses at a time when airline travel was fun. This is more silly soap opera than social drama, but it jets ahead of NBC's "The Playboy Club."

Our guides were remarkable. One spoke flawless English, although he had never visited an English-speaking country. The others made occasional errors, sometimes departing from standard idioms in delightful ways, but they nearly always succeeded in conveying their meaning. Although I have some knowledge of six languages (Latin, French, Spanish, British English, American English and Minnesotan) and I now know eight phrases in a seventh, I was humbled by their achievement, and I was reminded of the importance of achieving competence not only in one's native tongue, but also in other languages.

Because of that, Hester does what was almost unthinkable for a woman of her class and time and leaves her husband for her lover. Though conventional wisdom, personified by her loathsome mother-in-law (Barbara Jefford), insists "beware of passion, it always leads to something ugly," Hester (likely named in tribute to the heroine in "The Scarlet Letter") feels too stifled by conformity to stay put.

Real questions about electability will not go away. He has never won a general election larger than a Georgia congressional district. His personal history is far from role-model material, and many of our former colleagues have made it their business to derail his candidacy. Some have taken the time to follow Newt around the country in the interest of "setting the record straight." Such actions can also be labeled "getting even." This abuse directed to a former speaker is a function of unhealed wounds from past political clashes. There are many such wounds, and most emanate from his years as House speaker. Periodic displays of intellectual intolerance (Newt is the last guy to suffer fools) and a well-documented hypersensitivity to criticism (recall his post-Nevada caucus press conference) complete the explanation as to why his gender gap persists, and why the Obama camp is not especially fearful of a Gingrich nomination.

Bo has not been seen in public since he was stripped of his Chongqing job last month. This week, the party also took away his seat on the wider 25-seat politburo. The last time the party purged one of the elite in such public fashion was in 2006, when Shanghai party chief Chen Liangyu was charged with corruption.
Late in the afternoon I walked down Roland towards the Rotunda. There, in the 4200 block, was the big blue and white 70’s car I’ve long associated with Mr. Herman. It was always parked in front of his building on Roland Avenue. When I approached it, I saw the back of a man’s head in the driver’s seat and wondered who on earth could be driving the car so soon after his death. As I passed, I saw the man I have long thought was Walter Herman sitting behind the steering wheel. I stopped. I turned again and looked, and there he was. Not a replica of man. Not a cut out, but the man himself.
"Yes," she said. "To raise the standard in a moral way, whatever that may mean."

But in the case of "The Fighter," not even a movie star helped. The story of boxer Micky Ward, his struggle for success and his tempestuous relationship with his half brother, Dicky Eklund, was hindered because it would likely carry an R rating, it was a drama targeted to adults, and it was expensive. In one iteration of the film, its budget hovered around $70 million, with Brad Pitt set to star opposite Mark Wahlberg, also a producer on the film, and Darren Aronofsky directing.

Officials hope that combining the two funds, if only for a short time, will create a backstop large enough to convince investors that the Eurozone stands behind countries like Spain and Italy.

It's been a speedy ascent for SLU, which three weeks into the season is the only team in the AP top 25 that didn't get even a vote in one of the preseason polls. The Billikens, who were 12-19 last season, got everyone's attention with their win over Washington on Nov. 20 and then kept right on going by winning three games over teams from BCS conferences at the 76 Classic in Anaheim, Calif., all by double digits. SLU's 6-0 start is its best since the 1997-98 team, with Larry Hughes, went 8-0, and it's the first time SLU has won six straight games by double digits since the 1947-48 team that won the NIT. Computer simulations of the RPI have SLU in the top 10.

Our question on high-deductible health care plans generated by far the most comments from Minnesota employers. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64 percent) agreed that high-deductible health plans "are helping to reduce health care costs.'' The rest disagreed.

But secret restaurants are increasing in importance in Los Angeles, floating dining rooms where you realistically won't land a table unless you know somebody involved.

In 2006, the Department of Defense described the lenders as "predatory" and a threat to national security.

The measure trims the number of states in which gays and lesbians can legally marry from three to two.

Where are the women? I am getting tired of hearing opinions mostly of men either pro or con about the contraceptive controversy created by the Affordable Health Care Act and the Obama administration. I have been reading opinions for weeks and very few are voiced by women. Let me begin by saying that as a Catholic and a woman I am insulted that this president is using this issue now to drum up votes for his re-election. It is a blatant attack on religious freedom but disguised as a "women's rights" issue. Women do have rights but they have something more exceptional. They have been endowed by God with the miracle of giving birth. This is a blessing for all of us faith believers. It is not a disease. How obviously secular it is to spin it as such. The dignity of women has been under attack by feminists and many others. So glad that President Obama has brought this issue to the forefront because it has caused me to stand up, along with many Catholics, to fight for my religious freedom against government intrusion and the opportunity to stand up as a woman for what is honorable and right!

Nobody was considering a 12-win season when the Browns lost two of their first three games in 1986. They had been 8-8 in 1985, with veteran Gary Danielson the starting quarterback until an injury pushed rookie Bernie Kosar of Youngstown Boardman High School into the job. That team won the championship in a remarkably weak AFC Central Division. Then, in a first-round playoff game at Miami, the Browns took a 21-3 lead before losing, 24-21.

"I told her (when Mullin was named Wayne County economic development director) that she would have the same contract as her predecessor, and I was a person of my word. If he got the same separation amount, and if you're a person of your word and it's the same thing, she should get it. But what evolved, quite frankly, was that at that point, I asked, 'What does the contract actually state as far as what the obligation is?' And (the severance payment) was for a forced separation -- being let go, basically. As soon as I found out that was the exact language, I called her up -- I was in Asia -- and demanded that she give it back. And she did.

The grim tidings from businesses and households help to explain why euro-zone political leaders are beginning to shift gears to promote economic growth. After months of unrelenting fiscal austerity, deemed necessary for the euro zone to emerge from the debt crisis, policy makers are waking up to concerns that governments are driving their economies into a new recession that will undo any improvements thus far in state finances. While policy makers appear to have recognized the risks of too much belt-tightening, finding a policy formula for generating more demand on tight budgets is a challenge governments are only beginning to confront.

Sad to say this is true. In 1992, 38-year-old Greg Austin Gingrich leaped atop the guard wall and wind-milled his arms, playing-acting losing his balance to scare his teenaged daughter, then he comically "fell" off the wall on the canyon side onto a short slope where he assumed he could land safely. As his daughter walked on, trying not to fuel her father's dangerous antics by paying attention to them, Gingrich missed his footing and fell silently about 400 feet into the void. It took rangers quite a while to locate his body -- and to determine that his daughter was an orphan only due to his foolishness.

Many years ago, I was riding a train to Seattle and met a young woman who was on her way to a summer job at Glacier Park Lodge in Montana. It's a spectacular place, and apparently competition is tough for the available seasonal positions. I figured the girl would be pretty excited about the opportunity, but she was disappointed that the only job she could get was to work in the lodge's laundry, washing linens and employee uniforms. "How can I write to my friends and tell them I'm doing THAT?" she moaned. When she heard I was a professional writer, she asked me to create an impressive-sounding way to describe her assignment. Sure, why not? Presuming that the lodge wouldn't be printing business cards for her, and that she would only be sharing her "title" with people on the outside, we came up with Assistant Director of Apparel Management. If you parse those words, you'll see they're not exactly untrue. You wash uniforms; you directly assist with managing apparel.
