Meditating on the pain and the glory of the Cross, I will not try to place the burden of blame elsewhere; I will instead focus on my own need for reconciliation and peace as I pray for the wisdom to let God be God.

Yet the film is no departure at all from such earlier Fincher films as "Seven" and "Zodiac," since it involves, as they did, acts of ghastly violence committed under grisly circumstances. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography does lustrous variations on the darkness the director favors; Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack. One script change warrants discussion—I won't discuss it because I won't divulge it—but most of the film follows the original, sometimes shot for shot. It's certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it, however, there's no way of unseeing it, and nothing in the new one to top it.

For decades, the Department of Defense has been hugely successful at fostering breakthrough technology. Al Gore didn't invent the Internet, but an organization called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency did -- along with the GPS in your phone, speech-translation technology, stealth planes and much more.

Similar to a venture capital firm, ARPA-E can direct federal energy-research dollars to drive innovation and growth, and eventually pay for itself many times over.

Back around 1998, I was a server at our fish fry at St. Mary's in Bedford. As I made my rounds to the tables offering coffee and hot water for tea, I came across a pleasant elderly lady who would always ask for tea. Every week without fail she would also say: "Young man, do you have any honey for my tea?" My response was, "No, unfortunately we only offer packets of sugar." This went on for about three weeks, until -- determined to make her day -- I brought some of my own and waited until she asked again. When she did, I responded, "Of course I do!" and proceeded to pull the honey out from my suit coat breast pocket. The name of the lady is lost in time. The favor I did for her was a small one. But the smile on her face and the delight it brought her will live with me forever. -- Stephen J. Zaborszki, Northfield Center

EMSA is also looking at ways to cut maintenance costs. The agency already eliminated storage in Southern California by moving one of the hospitals to a state warehouse in Northern California. Other ways to save include lengthening the response time from three days to five or seven days; moving the hospitals into smaller warehouses; asking local and federal agencies for help; and relying on other agencies' medical caches rather than keeping dedicated supplies for the hospitals.

Personal story: "Last summer, I traveled to Biloxi, Mississippi with a group of girls from my school to work on a senior service project. We volunteered with a group called Back Bay Mission for a five-day period. We were there to learn about the hardships of the people suffering from the effects of Hurricane Katrina and help them in any way possible. Jobs ranged from pulling weeds and spreading mulch in parks to building houses. My job for the week was to demolish a house that had been condemned. The interior of the house was over seventy percent destroyed, and the local government demanded that it be demolished. The owners of the house were in a devastating financial crisis; they were making only $12,000 each year, and the demolition would cost around $8,000. A group of about twenty girls, including myself, worked tirelessly on the house, ripping off shingles, prying up floorboards, and tearing down walls. On the fifth day, the house was done. Our mission was an extremely rewarding success."

The problem is the execution. Even with a playful premise, John Orloff's screenplay and Roland Emmerich's direction never lift the production above a tired heaviness, a we've-seen-all-this-before predictability.

They launched O'Fallon in 2000, and along with brew master Brian Owens, made, bottled and even delivered beer themselves. Sales grew, slow but steady, to 2,900 barrels - the equivalent of about 980,000 12-ounce bottles - in 2008 around the Midwest. They had a couple of rough years in 2007 and 2008, but demand continued to grow, so the O'Fallon hired a Wisconsin brewery to make their bottled beer, expanded to 11 states, and signed on with a small distributor in Missouri. Sales doubled, but the deals left them strapped for cash. By early last year, the whole operation was on the ropes. The Caradonnas had to cut hours for their handful of employees, and stop making beer while they looked for investors.

COURT CASE - If you see someone familiar peeking out of the pages of next month's issue of Redbook magazine, it's because our town's Courtney O'Donnell is featured in a three-page spread. O'Donnell, 34, a Creve Coeur native, is based in Washington as communications director for the nation's second lady, Jill Biden. The magazine feature is about how O'Donnell manages her career, a commuter marriage - her husband, Cassidy Morgan, 35, is a branding consultant whose job requires him to be in New York - and a 15-month-old son, Felix. The short answer is that she works very hard at it and has a lot of help from a network of friends and her family, including her mother, Phyllis O'Donnell, and a sister, Kelly, who lives in Boston. O'Donnell also credits her boss and office with having a "family-first" attitude. That's a particularly good thing since O'Donnell is expecting the couple's second child in August.

Last Good Friday, a horrible storm tore through St. Louis just as worship was beginning. I know that the weather kept many people from attending worship-probably a wise decision. As the few who were gathered approached the cross, the storm railed against the building. As we prayed, businesses and homes near the airport were being assaulted by a tornado.

The answer: We've worked on transactions for more than a year and they never came together. I recently negotiated a lease for somebody, start to finish, in two weeks. That was a blistering pace. I think there are going to be more people in the market. I still think rents are going to be a little bit softer than they were. There will probably be some more surprises where bigger blocks of space come on the market because of mergers and acquisitions.

1. Wanna play the price game? Angry car rental agents can modify the rate you're paying, often broadsiding you with a new, higher price when you pick up the vehicle. When Shirley Garcowski booked a car in Orlando recently, that's what her agent did. "When I went to pick up the car, the rate they were giving me was higher than the rate quoted when I booked the car," she said. "They said the corporate rate is only an estimate -- the only locked-in rate is through their website." That's nonsense, of course. And she knew it. She complained to a manager, who agreed to honor the original price as "a one-time accommodation."

Since the fall of the USSR, our “terrorist” military has stood alone as the world’s sole superpower. Did we try to conquer the world? To control precious resources? No. We defended Kuwait against Saddam Hussein’s attack. We defended Bosnia against Slobodan Milosevic. We helped the Iraqis and Afghanis free themselves from Hussein and the Taliban and, we hope, establish democracies. We have spent thousands of lives and trillions of dollars in largely selfless attempt to oppose dictators and help others enjoy the same freedoms we enjoy.
Speakeasy Prohibition Ale ($10/six-pack, 6.1 percent): Naming all the fruit esters and toasted, creamy notes given off by this beer would trump the ingredients in a Whitman Sampler - candied citrus to nougat and plenty of nuttiness.

SAN FRANCISCO - A small wall display holds a can of Spam, an antler, a beer bottle, two Barbie dolls, a turtle shell, a man's boot and a license plate, all found in the stomach of a tiger shark. In a darkened tank nearby, a giant Pacific octopus pulses and whirls, waving its tentacles. A plaque states that the animal can communicate moods and signal such sentiments as "Go away" or "I find you attractive."
Passing resolutions is better than doing nothing but what's really needed is a Texas business leader willing to speak up - loudly - and challenge the governor. It's hard to think of a recent example of a Texas business leader accomplishing a public-spirited goal. They're all held hostage to "no-new-taxes" Grover Norquist clones who fail to see that government serves important functions. I, for one, don't want to live in a town where citizens have to wait for water to be trucked in. That happened here in Texas last summer, and yet the Legislature repeatedly fails to fund new water resources. In 2002, the state water plan's price tag was $18 billion. By 2007 (the last estimate), the cost had risen to $31 billion. With Perry's compact, new funding for the water plan evaporates.

I'm sure it need not be said, but no one else in the world pays tuition rates close to what we pay for our higher education. Balk as we may at the Scandinavian model, students there attend universities for free and are given a living stipend so that they do not have to work while in school. Admittedly, there are trade-offs such as higher taxes, but the truth is what happens here isn't so different. People take on $20,000 to $200,000 of debt. This is insanity. And worse, the likelihood of working in a job that never required any degree whatsoever becomes, increasingly, the norm.

What if McGwire has to sing about exactly what other people in the Cardinals' organization knew and when did they know it?
My comment is about "Do the job right" (Sound Off comment, March 21 Journal), concerning AmerenUE trimming trees in the St. Peters area. People need to understand, coming from a public utility worker that does not work for Ameren, the trees are usually trimmed due to the fact that they are in the utility right of way. The trees should not be planted in the utility right of way; they should be away from the power lines. For us that do not have trees around power lines, we could look at it another way: part of my electric bill goes to paying for the tree trimming for people that do plant trees in the utility right of way. If they are in the utility right of way, they ought to be cut down, because that's part of my bill, being directed to the expense of trimming the trees. People need to think about that. The utilities are affected.

Offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich couldn't come up with any names of anybody on offense who impressed him. Tight end David Paulson was his reliable self.

Reserve receiver Blake Stanton made a couple of nice plays.

The findings come from a pilot project at Eastbank Hatchery in Wenatchee, Wash., carried out by Chelan County Public Utility District, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Conservation Fund's Freshwater Institute. Researchers determined that fish raised in circular tanks migrated downstream faster upon release, reaching a checkpoint five days earlier than their brethren. More of them survived, as well -- 72 percent compared to 52 percent of fish raised in rectangular tanks, according to a Freshwater Institute news release. Also, the fish raised in circular tanks included fewer "mini-jacks," juvenile salmon that become sexually mature early and stay in freshwater rivers instead of migrating to the ocean. Researchers are concerned that hatchery-raised jack salmon can distort the genetic makeup of wild salmon over time.

My boyfriend and I are college juniors, happily together 10 months and living together for five. An article I read said it’s healthy to argue with your partner, and I got a little worried. We sometimes bicker about what to watch on TV, but one of us quickly gives in, and that’s it. It does bug me that he’s chronically late and his car is filled with dirty cups, random CDs, empty wrappers, etc., but I basically just shrug this stuff off. He seems to do likewise with stuff I do that bugs him. Are we both just really easygoing? I worry that we may be missing some passionate connection.

More cinematically, there were Elliott's tours of Europe with the famous French chanteuse Jacqueline François, and the good times of hanging out in Paris, enjoying the Bohemian life with his fellow expatriate American pals, Quincy Jones and Burt Bacharach, who became lifelong friends. Bobbi's bio-pic would light up with close-up shots of young Jack as the smart, debonair piano man entertaining the swells at New York's famous Stork Club, winning the hearts and minds of café society's elite.

Since February, the Mobile Kitchen, a program of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's Portland council, has offered meals to people who live in out-of-the-way places, in the form of a rolling restaurant.

So perception of public land ownership is vastly different from north to south in Michigan, with UP residents feeling surrounded by it and those in the southern counties feeling as if they have to drive miles to find themselves in natural surroundings. A cap might someday even preclude downstate acquisitions, a terrible price to pay for UP concerns about too much public land.
A: I didn't go to college. I was at the ranch. My parents were in San Diego. And I would come to San Diego on the weekends to do the shopping. I read in the paper that the Old Globe Theatre, used by the Navy during World War II, was being returned to the community. I volunteered there, and they were just grateful for another pair of hands. It gave me something I could go out to do and just be helpful. There, I was accepted for myself. To the people at the ranch, I was the scullery maid, milking the goats and getting the breakfast and cooking.
WASHINGTON — Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney added to his big lead in the race for convention delegates Tuesday by sweeping Republican presidential primaries in North Carolina, Indiana and West Virginia, inching closer to the number of delegates needed to clinch the GOP nomination.
That progress must include compromises from each state. Not least among those would be a willingness by Missouri politicians to accept widening the river in some areas, which likely would reduce navigation possibilities north of Kansas City, and a willingness from North Dakota officials to accept lower reservoir levels to increase flood protection.
I'm also a Bradford fan. I saw what he could do in reasonable circumstances in 2010. The Rams weren't all that talented but Bradford was the Rookie of the Year after leading the team to a surprising 7-9 record, a major improvement from 1-15 in 2010. That 7-9 isn't much different than Denver's 8-8 record in 2011, and I think it's safe to say the Rams have less talent than the Broncos.

Driving through the Silver Lake hills to avoid Sunset Boulevard's panicked snarl, I climb along the incline. People are out jogging and walking their dogs, even though fires have moved closer, are no longer a distant TV hell. The higher I climb, the more I see residents take note of my car's make and colour; they mentally record the licence number, but most importantly, my unfamiliar deep-brown face, any distinguishing marks. They look at me as if they will at any moment join together to form a human barricade if I make a wrong or abrupt move. Later, across town, a blond man in the next lane looks over LA pickup casual, then quickly lifts his smoked-glass window.
