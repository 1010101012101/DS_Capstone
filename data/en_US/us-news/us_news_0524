But Dr. Brewer knew that strong memory traces are easier to access than weak and mistaken ones, which is why he only gave his witnesses two seconds to make up their minds.

However (this is the problem nobody wants to face), we can only focus on one thing by not focusing (in effect, discouraging) all the others. For example, maybe we shouldn't devote space at Playhouse Square to non-musicals if we want Cleveland to rival Broadway in musical productions – New York can afford to, but we can't. Also, maybe we shouldn't encourage all business start-ups or all scholarly research, but only those within the Music-Medicine-Materials triad.

The specter of North Korea's military ambitions has been especially worrying for Japan, which had seen previous North Korean launches over its territory. Its self-defense force had deployed antimissile interceptors on land and at sea ahead of the launch with orders to destroy the rocket or any of its parts if they posed any threat to Japanese land.

Casual is a key word at the very affordable restaurant, which is tucked into a tiny strip mall.

In this sense, the attack is very reminiscent of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. From 1980 to '82, the Palestine Liberation Organization had observed a truce along Israel's northern border. Israel then used the pretext of the shooting of an Israeli diplomat in London -- by the dissident Abu Nidal group that also murdered PLO officials -- to launch its Lebanon invasion.

Spring asparagus coming from the rich, peaty soils of the Sacramento Delta is sweet and tender and inexpensive, very different from that coming on a long truck ride from Mexico in December and January. It matters because as we know and understand our California-grown food and its seasons, we are re-establishing the lost link between our land and our food. Farmers markets in California and some of our restaurants are bringing a deeper understanding of provenance and seasonality to what we eat, and where is it more important to do this than in our homes and schools, educating our children and preserving the patrimony of our California agriculture?

There you have the story in a nutshell. The real fares on either line are virtually identical, at $2,140.10 (sorry, but I can't explain that 8 cent difference).

Cooking can be messy business, so when you've plunked down a large chunk of change on a new iPad, the reluctance to bring it into the kitchen is understandable, particularly if you're a baker known for letting the flour fly. The solution: Chef Sleeves. Just slide your iPad into a disposable, touch-sensitive plastic sleeve, peel off the resealable strip, then recycle each sleeve when you're done.

"Screening procedures for passengers with medical devices, who are 75 and older, will not change.

Rose complained that media shied from the story for weeks. "The only suspect timing here is, it's not about who we've talked to, why this took so long to come out. There's been 15,000 people who've already voted (via mail-in ballots) in Tempe."
"Of all the hundreds of agencies that received this information, not one has bitten on the bait except Dakota County, Minnesota," Rivas said.
There is a good chance Chris Schwinden (eight innings pitched, 11 runs allowed in two starts) will not receive a third start. Manager Terry Collins refused to commit to using Schwinden again after his performance on Wednesday. The three realistic options are Jeremy Hefner (2.08 ERA in Triple A), Garrett Olson (3.29 ERA in Triple A) and long reliever Miguel Batista. Hefner impressed Collins during a three-inning cameo in April.

Still, so-called "umbrella" organizations such as the Tea Party Express, the Tea Party Patriots, FreedomWorks and others haven't, to date, put their names behind any one candidate. And only in recent weeks have tea party darlings such as U.S. senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah finally weighed in -- endorsing likely nominee Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor whom some see as un-tea-party-like as one could be, in part because of his state's own health-care reform law.

Still, Ms. Rawlings-Blake has no interest in changing the program. Why? Because doing so could have the effect of increasing tax bills for elderly or low-income homeowners and wind up forcing them out of houses they have occupied for decades. The fact that the biggest beneficiaries of the program happen to be some of the city's wealthiest residents is, evidently, just an unfortunate side effect. "I don't think that increasing property taxes on people who have lived here for a long time is going to help us grow," Rawlings-Blake spokesman Ryan O'Doherty told Ms. Smith Hopkins and Mr. Calvert.
She was also forgiven. Reynolds would acknowledge voting for Taylor when she was nominated for "Butterfield 8" and decades later co-starred with her old rival in "These Old Broads," co-written by Carrie Fisher, the daughter of Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.
“I can honestly say what we’ve walked through is too hard for me. I’m kind of a wimp, and we would not have made it through without God,” she said. “The fact that we’re together is truly an act of God.

The development of new housing choices has been motivated, in part, by financial considerations. Ecumen once mainly operated nursing homes, but changed its focus "to being more in the hospitality business than in the healthcare business" after the government cut reimbursements for skilled-nursing care, Ordahl said. Since 2004, the company has slashed its nursing-home units by about a third and nearly quadrupled its supply of market-rate housing, whose costs aren't subsidized by the government.

If you're looking for Michigan companies with dividends, however, the pickings are slim, said David Sowerby, portfolio manager for Loomis, Sayles in Bloomfield Hills. That's because of a limited number of publicly traded companies -- and a heavier weighting of banks, which generally eliminated or cut dividends because of the 2008-09 crisis.
Fruit trees provide the same benefit. A tree from a nursery can run from $25 to $100, but the payout is big, Peterson said. Two of his apple trees, for instance, provide between 300 and 400 pounds of fruit each year.

When you meet in a public place, you can never prepare enough. Some places just don't lend themselves to good business conversations.

The preferred design of the 18 presented by Anshen & Allen would have replaced the existing railings with a new 8-foot-high fence that consisted of thin vertical rods spaced 6 inches apart. The plan never progressed to a final design stage, much less construction -- in part, Parker says, because the transportation district wanted Anshen & Allen to agree that if someone was able to scale the barrier and commit suicide, the architects rather than the district would be held liable in lawsuits.
Cyclists made figure eights through downtown and Old Town Auburn, passing the starting line five times to the delight of fans, who jammed the city's winding streets and created a chaotic and lively scene.
It's hurting our economy, starving it of the 1.3 million college graduates Michigan will need to fill work force demand by 2025. It's putting us behind other states such as Texas, California and North Carolina, which spend an average of $2,000 more than Michigan does per student.
First, we know that we can't keep cutting our way to prosperity. Businesses need an educated workforce, people and businesses need roads and bridges to get to and from work, etc. That's why supporting the temporary tax measure that the governor is working to place on the November ballot is absolutely critical.
Amone gets a bit lost in the midst of all these top prospects like Dee Hart, Ha'sean Clinton-Dix, LaQuentin Smith, Roderick Ryles, Darryl Monroe and on and on. All are seniors, all are Division I-A commitments, with the exception of Smith, and he will be. For Smith, it looks like he'll be heading to either USF or Arkansas. The seniors, however, look up to their junior warrior. In fact, to get the DP boys fired up prior to a game, Amone does an energetic Samoan dance just before the kickoff.

Schmitt's pointers: "If your budget allows for it, buy a bike equipped with at least Shimano 105 or equivalent. The parts work great and are durable. Also, if something breaks, it won't hurt the pocketbook as much. You'll probably be dealing with an aluminum, or a less expensive chrome-moly/steel frame and a carbon fork. If you fall in love with cross, then your big upgrade should be a set of tubular wheels. Biggest difference you can make. Also, one of the nerdiest.
In 2003, Thurston signed up to participate in a painting class held at Avamere Hillsboro, where she has lived since 2001.

Indeed, VersaEmerge’s inventive covers of pop hits have become part of their repertoire. Kusterbeck gets the catch in Estelle’s voice right in their interpretation of "American Boy," and her paranoid glee during her take on "Toxic" exposes this art-rocker for the Britney Spears fan she is.
The San Francisco Giants baseball team started using a dynamic pricing system created by a company called Qcue Inc. in 2009. The team found that adjusting prices in real time to reflect sales data, league standings and which opposing team was visiting helped sell more tickets.

Daimler Trucks, formerly known as Freightliner, employs about 2,000 nonunion workers at its headquarters in Portland. The cuts also affect white-collar workers in Redford, Mich. and Ft. Mill, S.C.

It's not so much anti-Christian prejudice as it is fear of real faith, and a failure of imagination. And when it comes to creating film fantasy, that's an unforgivable sin.

"If Gambling Enforcement has a problem, they need to talk to the Legislature about it or else get out there and do their job," he said. "Just saying, 'Well, we don't have the time or we don't have the manpower,' that just doesn't cut it."
Maryland Family Law states in several sections of its code that a "person … who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect shall … notify the local department or the appropriate law enforcement agency." It doesn't get clearer than that. And those laws are in addition to the mandatory requirements placed upon health practitioners, police officers, educators and human service workers.
Meanwhile, sidestepping the talk of bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities, Obama is trying to dismantle the mullahs’ nuclear house brick by brick — via sanctions, but also some level of involvement (cooperation? intelligence-sharing? just quiet approval?) in cybersabotage and daring commando raids in downtown Tehran.

What makes the Bye Bye Blackbirds so much better than the average gang of classic pop revivalists? In part, it’s that they love the Heartbreakers just as much as the Beatles: singer Bradley Skaught has an appealing Tom Petty twang to his voice, and his Blackbirds drive home his songs with “Damn the Torpedoes” conviction and the acid twinkle of “Don’t Come Around Here No More.” Some of the instrumental passages on “Fixed Hearts” are just as appealing as the well-turned melodies: the sudden blues-rock eruption that caps “Jack Frost,” for instance, or the long, twinkling, pastoral outro to “Silver Sands” that closes the Oakland band’s album. Skaught is also a fine, thoughtful lyricist with a well-developed sense of the importance of scene-setting, writing persuasively about the haze of summer barbecues and the chimneys and eves of seaside towns. (A typical Californian, he also loves to sing about the sun.) And he’s courteous enough to turn over the spotlight to his guitarist Ian Robertson, who contributes the warm semi-acoustic instrumental “Hawaii.” In other words, for the Blackbirds, this is not a formal exercise: their interpretation of vintage pop-rock is radiant with enthusiasm for its glories, past and present.

These soldiers' emotional regulation response--high activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex--still did not automatically go quiet when the amygdala became active, or kick back in when the amygdala returned to its resting state.

It would take six months and cost $65, the man told the young hunter, and that didn't seem right.

The reason Republicans think winning the presidency in 2012 is essential to fulfilling the promise of 2010 is that Barack Obama, former paladin of change, will veto change. So McCarthy understands that, pending a Republican president, much of Republican governance must occur down in the weeds of government -- in the Federal Register, the record of the regulations by which the executive branch exercises its will without much congressional supervision or circumscription.

Explaining American politics to the British, columnist Michael Cohen in the Guardian compares Mitt Romney to Don Draper of "Mad Men" fame -- "a figure buffeted by the social and economic changes of the 1960s. Romney appeals to those who, rather than adapt to that change, are fighting desperately against it." I'm not sure the U.S. electorate is really as polarized on racial lines as Cohen believes, but his piece has at least one terrific line: "If 2008 was change (Obama) v more of the same (McCain); 2012 is more of the same (Obama) v restoration of a bygone era."

At the three Geo prisons - Florence West, Phoenix West and the Central Arizona Correctional Facility - Corrections Department inspectors found such issues as inmates having access to a control panel that could open emergency exits; an alarm system that didn't ring properly when doors were opened or left ajar; and that staff didn't carry out such basic security practices as searching commissary trucks and drivers, among many other failures.
Record-keeping problems were a major factor leading up to the disaster, which killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes.

Remember in 2010 when the law was debated in Congress much of the angst and vigorous debate centered on the mandate – forcing private citizens to purchase insurance or pay a fine. Because of political circumstances, namely the death of Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, the law, ironically, would not have passed without the mandate.

Already during their heyday, the Templars attracted to themselves many associations, legends, rumors and romances. When the story of the Holy Grail first began circulating in medieval Europe, it was immediately associated with the Templars. This star quality of the Templars was due partly to their prominent role in the central movement of the times, the Crusades and the defense of the Crusader states in the East, where the Templars were surrounded by potent historical and sacred associations. After all, the Templars were founded on Christmas Day 1119, within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the spot which marks the crucifixion, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and they were headquartered on the Temple Mount, which indelibly associated them with stories surrounding the Temple of Solomon -- and nothing in medieval Christendom could beat that!

Among policy wonks and thoughtful politicians, there's a fair amount of bipartisan consensus that, to achieve efficiency, fairness and simplicity, we need fewer tax incentives that distort economic decisions.

Anyway, here she is in the very modern and mysterious The Future - a film she wrote (adapting her own performance piece) and directed, and which she stars in opposite the decidedly un-Gable-esque Hamish Linklater. She's Sophie, he's Jason, and the two of them are in a state of profound inertia.

But there are lessons to be learned from Brooks' experience.
Early in their history, Bon Jovi was considered a metal band; a lite one, to be sure, but metal nonetheless. It was the mid-'80s, and if you wanted to play with the big boys in the stadiums -- and Bon Jovi always had those aspirations -- a metal edge was optimal. Bon Jovi shared much with the heavy metal bands of the period: a developed sense of theater, a passion for overstatement, and a taste for glorious bombast. But they've never had any time whatsoever for metal's nihilism. Even when he's sung about getting shot through the heart by the arrow of bad love, Jon Bon Jovi can't help but be positive.
