This long-awaited decision by the EEOC is a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done. Several bills in Annapolis this year would have made a difference to thousands of Marylanders with criminal records. One bill, known as "Ban the Box," passed the Senate Finance Committee with bipartisan support but was killed in House Appropriations.

D.R. Horton "turned in an excellent quarter on virtually every metric," Stephen East, a home-builder analyst with ISI Homebuilding Research, wrote in a client note.

It has weathered the recession better than many places. Its relatively affordable real estate and accessible business climate make it attractive to creative entrepreneurs.

The day will come again when we need immigrant workers in fields like home construction. That need has never gone away when it comes to agriculture - just ask the Alabama farmers who have seen their crops rot in the fields due to a lack of both immigrant labor and willing U.S. workers.

"We've been together nearly four years now. This is our third St. Patrick's Day. I came up with the name of the band, but I admit it was due to what I call a lot of market research. At first, I decided we'd call ourselves Whiskey Rebellion, but then found out there were about 20 other Irish bands with that name. So, I took the Irish whiskey idea, that being a beverage that immediately comes to mind when Irish is mentioned, and then thought of Guinness which also comes to mind.

The Drunkard's Son is more than anything a storytelling vehicle that allows Foley to explore everything from the joy of playing King of the Hill during the Great Snow of '67 to the painful reality of white flight in St. Sabina's parish where he was raised - his family bouncing from apartment to apartment before his father's premature death in the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium.
Chris: I can’t believe that Ben’s mom and sister were won over so quickly. Did Courtney offer to sleep with them, too? Julia asks what their dad would say if he was here. He would say, “Why the hell is my son on a reality dating show?”
While parents have no official veto power over roommate choices, Bonilla said she routinely advises applicants to the gender-neutral housing to talk it over with them.
Dr. Caitlin Messner, 26, a second-year pediatric resident, is one of Ghori's students at MetroHealth. For the first six months of her first-year residency, she worked traditional 30-hour shifts, and then the hospital switched to the new 16-hour schedule. Messner said the shorter shifts made it easier for her to study and spend time with her family, including her daughter, Emerson, now 16 months.

Thompson's letter included a notation that he had sent copies to the Times, the Tampa Tribune, WEDU-Ch. 3 and "others."
Let me start by saying how sad it is to have this kind of articles in the Orlando media. It is absolutely the kind of press that aims at making a bigger issue than what it really is.

Because Mozart's first movement cadenza for No. 25 has not survived, it's soloist's choice. Helmchen performed one by Martin Hecker, filled with complexity, a certain dramatic ambiguity and a decidedly Romantic flavor.
* Rams offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels continues to confuse me. When A.J. Feeley took over for an injured Bradford earlier this season, McDaniels scaled down the passing offense. He did it for Clemens, too. As he should have. It made sense. It would have also made sense to simplify the offense for Bradford. After all, Bradford is in his second NFL season. This is a new offense for him. He didn't have the usual offseason regimen to absorb it. Bradford clearly struggled to get comfortable in this offense -- especially when he was asked many times to set up on deep drops behind a weak offensive line to throw downfield to receivers that can't get open. Bradford is a rhythm passer. He's at his best on quick reads and throws. McDaniels and the Rams didn't adjust their offense to fit the QB skills.
Getting there: Icelandair flies nonstop to Keflavik International Airport from New York's JFK and Boston's Logan, with round-trip flights starting as low as $470. Flight time is about five hours there, six hours back (1-800-223-5500, www.icelandair.us). Add several hundred dollars to fly from Cleveland, which also may require an overnight stay on your way home (because flights from Keflavik arrive into both East Coast cities at 8 p.m.) Flybus is the cheapest way to get to downtown Reykjavik (about $11 one way, $19 round trip; book on www.re.is/Flybus).
Orr said the district lost $901,828 in state revenue. The district lost about $700,000 in state education formula funding, which is based on average daily attendance. The district scaled back its summer school program, reducing attendance, Orr said. The district lost another $200,000 when Gov. Jay Nixon withheld transportation funding in an attempt to balance the state budget, Orr said.
But much of this fun, forgettable show is derivative, a clever pastiche of old Broadway, vaudeville and 1960s sitcoms. The plot is "La Cage aux Folles" (which is derived from a French play, but no need for an originality inquest here), with ghouls instead of gays.
“I’m not saying nothing,” he said. “You could stick toothpicks up my fingernails and I wouldn’t.”
During the night, I lay awake, trying to decide what to do. Should I contact the American Embassy to see whether they could recommend a good, English-speaking dentist? Should I place a long-distance call to my dentist in New Jersey to ask his advice?
As for the cast, Rachel McAdams is spirited and lovely — she should have been a big star several times over, several years ago — but she can’t do much with this character. (Not only does the amnesia return her to who she was before she met Leo, who she was before she met Leo seems like a completely different person.)

Cash was "beloved the world over as much for his kindness and compassion and championing of the underdog as for the power of his art," Kristofferson said in a statement released just after his friend’s death.

The Pullman (330 7th St., 970-230-9234, thepullmangws .com) is the latest from Mark Fischer, the genius behind Six89 and Phat Thai in Carbondale, and this one is yet another hit. Located in the Railroad District, the casual eatery manages to pull off eclectic fare such as melt-in-your-mouth goat hash topped with a poached egg and truffle-enhanced pierogis, yet makes it all seem truly down-to-earth and fun. Not to mention affordable, because you can snack like crazy on small plates and walk out feeling satisfied and like you got your money's worth. Some of the best service around, too.
threat of a recession in Europe is likely to drag on the global economy. And another year of weak wage gains in the United States could force consumers to pull back on spending, which would slow growth.

Yackey said the $2.5 million development will produce a 4,400-square-foot building half the size of the commercial structure he had initially proposed for the site. State historic preservation tax credits will help fund the saucer project but the trick was finding suitable tenants, he said.
The Russell 2000 index of small stocks has now lost nearly 25 percent from its most recent high on April 29. A decline of 10 percent or more off recent highs is considered to be a correction. But a drop of 20 percent or more is said to be the start of a bear market.
The flourishing artisanal movement here is not an accident, Mullen says. Portland attracts craft masters of all kinds because making something is part of its cultural and historical DNA; the crucial nucleotide in that DNA is the college.
Limbaugh's place in American public life is in no way comparable to that of David Letterman, Bill Maher or Ed Schultz. ... Among TV and radio talkers and entertainers, there is none who commands anything like the deference that Limbaugh commands from Republicans: not Rachel Maddow, not Jon Stewart, not Michael Moore, not Keith Olbermann at his zenith. Democratic politicians may wish for favorable comment from their talkers, but they are not terrified of negative comment from them in the way that Republican politicians live in fear of a negative word from Limbaugh. ... That is why no one asks Democratic politicians to repudiate the latest strident statement from an Olbermann or a Moore. There's no sport in it. It's too easy for them to say, "Sure." For Republicans, it's tough. But maybe, after this latest outburst, a little less tough?Are there any positives from this? Well, the late-night comedy writers are having fun, including Stephen Colbert, who took some shots at Limbaugh on Monday night. Dittoheads might not appreciate Colbert's humor:

Kuala Lumpur and Singapore impressed with high-speed trains, high-end shopping, and high-energy city cultures.

Although Stuckey wears No. 3 now, it's really still Big Ben's number. And that No. 3 should be the next retired jersey hanging from the Palace rafters in another couple of years. His should be the only one from that second championship era to receive that privilege because he was the one who brought the mentality that little things sometimes render big rewards.

Clint Bowyer, making his debut for Michael Waltrip Racing, was 22nd in qualifying but had his time thrown out when his car failed inspection. NASCAR said Bowyer will have to start last in Thursday's qualifying race, but that's the only penalty his No. 15 team will face.
"Desperate, scared teenagers facing a serious crisis will do desperate things,'' she said. "Back-alley abortions, attempts to self-induce abortion, traveling alone to distant locations, suicide attempts and completions or, more likely, just ignoring the problem and hoping it will go away, are all likely realities if Prop. 85 passes.''
Despite the bill clearing Massey's committee, it may face a tougher time before the House Finance Committee, where it heads next and most observers expect it to die. If it survives, it passes on to the House Appropriations Committee.
‘‘Would appear to be best suited to be an outside ‘backer, but he has never really played there on a full-time basis. Maybe be a little too big for safety in the NFL and has a lot to learn about blocking if you want him at tight end.''

In her young-adult novel "The Giver," Lois Lowry imagined one of those utopias that's so perfect it's creepy. In The Community, genetic engineering has made everyone more or less the same, and no one is sad or violent or in pain. Nor is there any spontaneity, eccentricity or passion. For a more recent perspective on utopia run amok, take a look at Lauren Groff's new novel, "Arcadia." Also Sam Taylor's "The Republic of Trees."

Built in the 1900s by liquor distributor A.F.K Kirchoff, the historic Silva House in Heritage Square Park seemed destined to become a bar. Plush lounge furniture on the grassy lawn and misters on the wood patio woo customers from Pizzeria Bianco across the square. Inside, the horseshoe-shaped bar connects the house's four small rooms. The venue hosts trivia and punk-rock nights, and it sees a lot of young bohemians looking to quench their thirst and fill up on the affordable pub grub. Happy hour is from 4-7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and includes $2 wells, $2 domestic beers and $1 off all draft beers. Plus, Pabst Blue Ribbon cans are always $2.

(Re: Letter to the Editor 'Frank's Salon' March 28.) To Bill. Thank you for pointing out, in a nutshell, that President Obama's call to Sandra Fluke to thank her for testifying on a subject that was important to him, in your mind, was simply a political dodge. Very astute.
The bottom line is that water must go somewhere, and the Missouri River flood-control system still is inadequate to deal with massive floods.
Adelman didn't get into the top 10 by just hanging around for a long time (with all due respect to Don Nelson), but by winning games.

A St. Charles man is charged with felony stealing after St. Peters police said he forged checks registered to the New Old Town Picnic Committee.
Thursday was the breaking point. My wife, the lucky duck, forced her way out the door and went to the calm confines of work. Added to the mix that day was my 2-year-old godson, Borrowed Bits, whom I normally babysit during the week, but he had spent the last two days holed up with his parents. He was so happy to see my boys that he was the least of my problems. I remembered the story my father-in-law had told me of his mother shooing her 11 kids out the front door during the summer months and telling them they weren't allowed back until dinner. She'd leave giant bowls of popcorn out on the porch to keep them from starving, but that was it.
The rebuilt plant is now testing its turbines in preparation for selling electric power in the region next month.

Dyer has staked out such a territory from the beginning, or the near beginning, of his career. Born in Cheltenham, England, educated at Oxford, he wrote an early novel and a study of John Berger, but found his voice with the 1991 book "But Beautiful" (published in the U.S. in 1996), an impressionistic paean to Lester Young, Bud Powell, Duke Ellington and other jazz musicians, filtered through photographs, recollections and Dyer's sense of the music as a spiritual force. His nonfiction follow-up, "Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling With D.H. Lawrence," is a masterpiece: a book undertaken (at least in part) to avoid writing another book, which leads the author to meditate not just on Lawrence but also on reading, writing and evasion — and as such on himself.
With $1.2 million from the Department of Energy and $250,000 from a Wisconsin utility, Boezaart says the GVSU center had enough to build the buoy, give it a good workout late last year and get it launched this year. But without additional support, research and data analysis will be sharply limited and by 2013, the buoy -- one of just two in North America -- could be in dry-dock or leased to a user elsewhere who wants to explore the potential of wind energy.
Only when a 1928 exhibition placed Wacker Van Goghs next to the real thing did misgivings surface. A fraud case slowly got under way, and, in 1932, Wacker was found guilty after a sensational trial that featured paintings in the courtroom and conflicting expert testimony. Despite having no particular expertise in Postimpressionism, Ludwig Justi, the ambitious director of Berlin's Nationalgalerie, told the court that the Wacker paintings were "as false as any pictures can possibly be" and ridiculed the scholars who authenticated them. For their part, the Van Gogh specialists confusingly claimed, in contrast to the court's own findings, that some were real and some were fake.

Or maybe with desires unclear and direction uncertain, that destination must remain unknown.
With any hint at female love interests safely removed, Rapace checks back in as a sort of chaperone or little sister who spends much of the movie redefining the blank stare as the guys squabble and solve problems. I’ve seen golden retrievers in heat sniffing each other less thoroughly than the boys do here. Their matey-ness peaks in a scene in which, while they’re supposed to be inconspicuous at a diplomatic meeting in (Holmesians, take note) Reichenbach Falls, Switzerland, they waltz each other around the dance floor in formal wear. “Who taught you to dance?” says Holmes. “You did,” says Watson. Romantic! Get a room, fellas, and don’t come out for the next sequel.
But they do fail.
"They have a want and desire to please. They want to be accepted by the group, the coaching staff and the fans," Wilkinson said. "They're always going to work for you. They bring youthful energy, an ability and belief in themselves. They don't know anything different."

How far short will be a question for as much as three more weeks. High flows at Bonneville, including court-ordered spill on top of spring runoff, tend to confuse salmon and make it hard for them to find the entrances to fish ladders on both sides of the dam.
There may be lingering post-9/11 skittishness in this country about living or working 100 stories above the ground. But our nervousness is increasingly irrelevant to global skyscraper statistics. In 2010, the tallest building constructed in the United States — the 818-foot-tall, 72-story Legacy Tower in Chicago — was the 19th tallest in the world. It was outranked by towers in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Nanjing, Shanghai, Ho Chi Minh City and Istanbul, among other cities.

“I think last night was just unacceptable, and it’s embarrassing,” Schmidtt, 21, said. “I feel like that they came out with this at 10 o’clock at night, and I feel like they knew it was going to happen. I don’t think that was the right thing to do.
Note: You will need a pasta maker (hand-cranked or electric) for this recipe, or you can roll out the pasta with a rolling pin. If you (or your kids) wish, you can mix the pasta dough by hand: Place the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well and mix quickly with a fork, then slowly incorporate the flour into the eggs with a fork or your hands until you have a shaggy dough. Knead the dough until it's soft and pliant, about 5 to 10 minutes, adding more flour if needed. For this recipe, your kids can crank the pasta machine and cut the noodles.
Ms. Barnes' disappearance struck a chord in Baltimore and in North Carolina. Family, friends and complete strangers held rallies and vigils in both states in the weeks and months after she went missing. The case got a small amount of national attention, but it did not — to the consternation of many involved, including the police — result in the wall-to-wall coverage cable news occasionally bestows on those who go missing. Many were unable to escape the conclusion that things might have been different if she had been white and wealthy, like Natalee Holloway, who disappeared on a Caribbean vacation in 2005. Ms. Barnes was black, and despite her good grades, strong family and lack of any trouble in her past, she received little notice in the national media. Whether race was the reason or not, the lack of coverage was a shame because it might have helped authorities bring the investigation to a close sooner.
--- I'm sticking with my initial pick of Wisconsin over Oregon --- 42-38. It's close. Wouldn't be surprised to see Oregon win, but I'm not going to flip flop. I like the Ducks offense vs. the Badgers defense a lot, but I see Oregon struggling on defense in much the same way as it did vs. Matt Barkley and USC.

Deciding when to boost interest rates and reel in the money plowed into the U.S. economy will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Fed in coming months. Removing those supports too soon could derail the recovery. But leaving them in place for too long risks unleashing inflation.

3. Here's my takeaway, again: considering where the Blues franchise had been in the previous six seasons -- mostly nowhere -- and considering the relative inexperience of this group in postseason hockey, there's no reason in the world for this team to apologize for a 109-point season that also featured the first postseason triumph in 10 years. A minority of fans is sniping about how this is another example of "The Same Old Blues" and I guess I'm struggling to understand that. I'm sorry, but have Hitchcock and Armstrong been running the show here since 1967, or even 2007? NO. Was this core nucleus of talent responsible for the Blues' postseason failures of the past? NO. So why are we holding this bunch responsible and accountable for what happened in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and the Aughts? Makes absolutely no sense. Again, I don't blame anyone for being hacked off, but at least try and channel the anger properly.
Though he's running on his business record, Romney was never in the business of creating jobs -- he was concerned only with creating wealth as he drove companies into bankruptcy, laid off workers and shipped jobs overseas.

Case in point: A large outside set came in, and I was in great position for a deep takeoff. As I dropped down the face of the wave, there was a guy paddling out in front of me. The correct thing to do would have been for him to paddle behind where I had to go. This would have caused him to have to eat the whitewater, but would have given me a clear shot at making the lined up wave.

Daniel Bryan and Punk met for the third time in a rematch from Tuesday's live Smackdown. This week's match didn't receive as much time as last week's, and therefore didn't have the opportunity to reach that level. The match was another strong outing from the duo, but the focus was placed on Raw general manager John Laurinaitis and Smackdown GM Teddy Long. By the end, all hell had broken loose, as the officials battled in the ring and Jericho assaulted Punk on the ramp and locked in a Liontamer.

In addition to its higher overall payroll, NJPAC’s staff cost is proportionally out of whack with the state’s other big performing arts centers when audience is considered. For example, NJPAC attracted roughly twice the number of people as Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood and the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank. However, NJPAC spent more than 10 times on staff compensation than BergenPAC and six times more than the Basie — $11.7 million compared with $1.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

An extension of NJ Transit’s Raritan Valley Line to Phillipsburg would bring about 650 riders, require roughly 20 miles of new track and cost up to $340 million, according to a study presented last week.
Wildfires are natural and beneficial in wild areas. Fires cleanse our native landscapes of dying and diseased plants. They nourish the soil with vital nutrients like phosphorous and potassium. And fire rejuvenates our wildflowers, perennials and shrubs. The challenge for those in high fire hazard areas is to act like the fire: to clean, nourish and rejuvenate the landscape around their homes before the fire does.

It’s understandable. Obama is running for re-election, and politicians running for re-election will use any advantage they can to win. This was the most popular decision of his life, and hitting people over the head with it on the occasion of an anniversary of something positive for them is just what politicians do.

If you are looking for a book that brings a corner of modern China alive—a book filled with humor, family squabbles and ordinary life in a large city in a one-party state—look no further than "The Little Red Guard." The focus of this delightful family memoir by Wenguang Huang, a Chinese-born writer now based in Chicago, is a simple wooden coffin that a lowly member of the Communist Party, the author's father, had secretly built for his mother in the mid-1970s, as a present for her 73rd birthday. She had been pestering her son for a coffin in preparation for her death, though she showed no sign of dying. The coffin, hidden by a tablecloth and painted with a fresh coat of black lacquer each year, became the family's unwelcome and dangerous guest.

The law, set to take effect July 29, requires police enforcing another law to question a person about his or her immigration status if there is "reasonable suspicion" that the person is in the United States illegally and makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally. Several lawsuits seeking to block its implementation are pending in U.S. District Court in Phoenix.

Actor Andy Griffith said in a statement that accompanied the family's Sunday morning announcement of Lindsey's death: "George Lindsey was my friend. I had great respect for his talent and his human spirit. In recent years, we spoke often by telephone. Our last conversation was a few days ago. We would talk about our health, how much we missed our friends who passed before us and usually about something funny. I am happy to say that as we found ourselves in our eighties, we were not afraid to say, 'I love you.' That was the last thing George and I had to say to each other. 'I love you.' "

The return of old-school power dressing is something of a "duh" moment for Bill Brewer, co-founder and managing partner of the law firm, which has offices in Dallas and New York City. He never really got the appeal of khakis and rubber-soled Gucci loafers at the office. He prides himself on custom three-button suits with a center vent and shirts from Bruce Clark in New York. His voice tightens with disdain when he describes "those square-toed club shoes" that some young recruits wear to the office.
