It was an ominous vision that gripped the Victorian imagination — a far cry from the ancient Greek notion of the ocean as an immense world-river named for Oceanus, the Titan, and populated by a trident-toting Poseidon and schools of mermaids.

It's a troubling combination for an unintentionally troublemaking but otherwise endearing boy who's been kicked out of orphanage after orphanage and is headed to yet another one as the book opens. What has long made him a nuisance to less intelligent adults and target practice for bullies also makes him a curiosity for a slightly older boy who befriends him at his new home — the ominously named Rothschild's End. The orphanage is housed in a two-story mansion built from drab gray stone that hints at the conditions inside. On the brink of closure for lack of funds, its director uses candles rather than electric lights to save money.

Pages 150-154: Leslie Hammond was walking her dog along the road that runs through the arboretum between Burnside at Fairview, heading toward Fairview, when she heard two loud noises. "So, I just kept walking, and thought, 'Gosh, that sounds like gunshots.' And then I heard some angry yelling. It sounded like just person. Then I heard two more shots. That's all I heard." Mowad: "When you heard the angry yelling, could you make out any of the words being said?" Hammond: "Not a word." Mowad: "From the first two shots to the second two shots, about how long of a period of time do you think elapsed?" Mowad: "This is a guess, but probably no more than a minute." Hammond said she got in her car and drove it to the center at the arboretum. She did not see the police officer or Collins' body.
And so, for example, Baez's rumination on the Chinese revolution in Tiananmen Square is preceded by a thematically related passage from Philip Pullman's children's novel The Amber Spyglass ("Being in love was like China: you knew it was there, and no doubt it was very interesting, and some people went there, but I never would") and followed by a spoken-word segment from W. Somerset Maugham's China-set novel "The Painted Veil."

In her two Portland concerts, Kwak showed different skills critical to a concertmaster, said Carlos Kalmar, the Oregon Symphony's music director. "On the Haydn program, she provided beautiful style and refinement. On the second program, she was not only a very strong leader, but a powerhouse when needed and the sweetest leading violinist when it came to her solos. The chemistry between us was amazing. She is a very calm, poised leader who has the respect of all of us."
But the record is 52-56 since then, turned in by largely the same cast, especially on offense. There's been only one notable winning streak -- five games over San Francisco (one) and Atlanta (four) that began near the end of April earlier this season. But it didn't hold, did not last.

The very concept of taking turns -- of deferring to someone else's wishes -- can be a huge leap for kids with autism. The label comes from the Greek word for "self," and one of its defining features is that people seem trapped in their own worlds. That was Mac, his mother says, when he got the diagnosis in 2006.

For most complete results, enter partial name of official or corporation. Some corporations give gifts directly to relatives of a leader, possibly to avoid triggering gift limits to the leader -- a last name search will generally show those gifts. Misspelling and spelling variations in the data, which are submitted by lobbyists under disclosure laws, are common. Some dates are approximate. If keenly interested in a particular gift, click "source" after getting your results to see if there are any footnotes related to the gift. Some corporations split the cost of gifts, but each report the full cost to the state. If you see multiple gifts of the same price and date but from different entities, it's likely that it's one gift from multiple sources.

Perhaps the best news for mothers who work comes from a 2008 Pew Research Center report on social trends. Thirty-six percent of working moms said they were very happy with their lives — the exact same percentage as stay-at-home moms reporting so.

A: Yeah. I had never written a song before! It was a crapshoot. We started by learning a bunch of covers so I could understand, or get a sense of what was happening versus what I thought — just the mechanics of playing. Then it was writing a whole lot of crappy lyrics (laughs). Then the first round of sounds — well, there was a lot of screaming (laughs) because I had never sung. Russ was busy so I would write songs and it fell on me to write the songs. He had been in a bunch of bands before and so he had a better ear for arranging and what worked and what didn't. Plus it helped that he wasn't attached to the song like I was so, he could come in and say "that's pretty good" or tell us it was time to be done with a song and move on.

Mock drafts can't pinpoint the Bears' biggest need. ESPN's Mel Kiper has the Bears taking Illinois defensive end Whitney Mercilus at No. 19, and colleague Todd McShay has them taking South Carolina cornerback Stephon Gilmore.

Generally, most people perceive economic suffering as a minority class phenomenon, especially amid national prosperity. For the indifferent and disconnected, the thought goes that poverty affects only those on the edge of society. Before scarcity took up residence on Main Street, even the well-off should have protested the mere existence of destitution.
Despite the difficult environment, "we're not just sitting still, waiting for that dark cloud to dissipate," said Chief Innovation Officer Ellis Burgoyne.
The last few "Grimm" episodes have been doling out hints, and Friday night's "Love Sick" was pretty much exclusively concerned with the series mythology. In fact, this week's homicides were committed by Renard himself. And we know he's looking for a key. But there are still questions. Lots of questions. Such as:
The 1.5-liter engine has most of the spunk that the vehicle requires, although drivers should refrain from pulling uphill from a start into traffic. Climbing some of the steeper grades on country roads in the Laurel Highlands can be slow but still better than a red VW Microbus.
In 1961, patrolman Edward K. Smerdel died after accidentally shooting himself while cleaning his pistol at a police substation. In his 11-year career, Smerdel received 16 commendations or commendatory reports, including one for saving a 3-year-old's life by administering CPR.

The bridges, except for the Bay Bridge, rode the waves well -- but they were closed several days for inspections and their approaches, in many cases, are badly damaged. Highway 80 along the bay is sinking in sandy ooze -- traffic is rerouted onto congested San Pablo Avenue. Even the Caldecott Tunnel, far from the epicenter, is partly blocked by landslides.
That's not to say that Delegate Smigiel won't get some signs across from his lawn. But if he so fears his constituents getting in his face, then he shouldn't have run for public office.

"Pertussis is a tough bacterium, and it's tricky," Resignato said. "For some reason the disease doesn't stimulate enough immune memory, so your immune system forgets how to fight it. That's the problem trying to make a vaccine that's really going to contain the disease."

U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas may have been joking, but according to a February Washington Post story, he seemed serious at a Natural Resources Committee hearing concerning why the United States should support oil drilling in Alaska. Caribou, he said, are fond of the warmth of the Alaskan pipeline. "So when they want to go on a date, they invite each other to head over to the pipeline," he said. That mating ritual, Gohmert concluded, is surely responsible for a recent tenfold increase in the local caribou population.
The two strands of the novel, the daughters' voices, are not woven, which might seem too simple but their characters bump into each other, setting in motion the plot. First, the reader meets Dana Lynn Yarboro, the beauty and intellectual, eloquently furious that she cannot be recognized and loved in public. Dana accidentally meets Chaurisse when both girls are 14, after Atlanta's science fair. Both girls are wearing waist-length rabbit fur coats — but Dana knows this is not coincidental. "It was the very same garment, right down to the crystal buttons on the sleeves. This was my sister… James was all over her face, from her narrow lips to her mannish chin. I looked so much like my mother that it seemed that James had willed even his genetic material to leave no traces." Dana's mother, Gwendolyn, was a beautiful young woman working as the first black gift-wrap girl in an Atlanta department store, only a month after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. She is divorced after a short marriage and meets James when she wraps a knife as a gift for his wife. They fall in love, and she gets pregnant.

An insufferable know-it-all, yet fascinating and somehow likable, Cumberbatch's Holmes is endlessly sly and quirky. So is the series built around this portrayal. But it's worth noting that Doyle's 19th-century Sherlock was a tightly wrapped collection of quirks. It's also worth noting that some of the best-loved and most-successful actors to play Holmes took enormous liberties with the character. That was true of William Gillette, the stage star who became the first actor known for playing Doyle's supersleuth. That was true of Robert Downey Jr., who gave us Holmes as an action hero in two hit films.

Oakland did have six outfielder/DHs to start the season, but if the A's want to keep both Ka'aihue and Barton around, someone would have to go from that mix. Oakland probably would entertain trade offers for Coco Crisp, but Crisp was ill much of the first month and is now on the disabled list, plus he is under contract for $6 million this year and $7 million next year.

Last summer Heide and Crull moved outdoors and built a 14- by 14-foot screened summer house, which they call their cabin in the city. It's at the edge of the back yard so they can see the garden from there. The summer house doesn't overpower the small urban yard because the structure matches the scale of the garage and echoes the architecture of the house, giving it a visual connection, Crull said.

I have to laugh, and remind myself it's a dream job being here."
After today, the commission will spend the next two weeks deliberating over a map before its deadline of April 3.
FitzGerald bristles at being labeled a political insider, though his r sum is a who's-who of Cleveland past and present -- impressive, considering he was born and raised in Indianapolis and politics was not the family business. His father was a doctor in the Air Force, his mother a social worker for the American Red Cross. The couple met during the Korean War.
Lilliquist retired Anthony on one pitch, a foul to first. But he walked Tino Martinez, another lefty, to bring pinch hitter Keith Mitchell off the bench. Hargrove let Lilli- quist face Mitchell, a right-handed hitter, instead of calling for Eric Plunk. Mitchell responded with a single to left that scored Griffey for a 3-2 lead.
The Senate Democrats' plan would require a three-fifths vote from each chamber to be placed on the ballot because it is a proposed constitutional amendment. Republicans hold a 59-40 majority in the House and a 23-10 majority in the Senate.
The smart money is on inflation. The Federal Reserve will print money and devalue our dollar. That means that the buying power of those Social Security checks will be far less than what it is today. Cost of living increases will become impossible to keep up with. So, technically, it's not a Ponzi scheme, because all of the money won't be gone. But for those who have paid into it all their lives, it will be the equivalent of one terrible investment. We lost our shirts on it. If we had any decency, we would allow our children and grandchildren to opt out and find their own investment.

Between 1991 and 2010, the homicide rate in the United States fell 51 percent, from 9.8 per 100,000 residents to 4.8 per 100,000.

With luck, the United States could soon equal its lowest homicide rate of the modern era: 4.0 per 100,000, recorded in 1957.

It's clear early on that the marriage will be a deliciously troubled one; indeed, the pages fly along as the workaholic, patronizing George pressures Amina with his stomach-turning sexual demands. George is as cold and unattractive to Amina as her first miserable Rochester winter turns out to be. The plucky, likable heroine, however, believes in her marital vows and does her best to accommodate George, often crying at night in the arms of a giant teddy bear.

The government buildings at State Center have aged beyond their useful life. They do not suit the state's needs well; they are expensive to maintain; and, in some cases, they may actually be dangerous to the civil servants who work there. Faced with that reality, the state could have knocked the buildings down and built new ones in their place, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, or more. It could have abandoned the complex and rented office space for workers downtown — the preferred solution of the litigants in this case. But that would have left a giant ghost town in central Baltimore and would have forced state agencies to split themselves among commercial buildings.

I think it's a bad idea for the state of Missouri to dip into the college reserve funds. They said, "Well, we'll pay it back." When? If they don't have the money now, what makes them think they're gong to have the money in the future? I doubt it. What is the college going to do if something happens and they need to dip into the reserve funds? Who's going to have to make up the difference? The students going to college? They have a hard enough time getting money for college.

Back at camp, the women have to fix their fire. Again. Why can’t they manage to keep the fire going? The men can. So the women go to the men, again, and ask for an ember. Most of the guys are OK with it, as long as there is some reciprocation in the future, except for Matt, of course.

It is such a great, usually calming, activity. One incident was not fun but memorable. We were stuck in quite a storm coming home from Sandusky. We had to take the long way back to Edgewater Yacht Club because the waters were too choppy.

Just as we rounded the breakwall, a huge Oglebay Norton boat was coming out of the channel. We didn't see it at first because of the fog. They didn't see us either. It was pretty scary.

The prevailing wisdom, however, was that the stomach was too acidic for bacteria to survive, and his observation was discounted until the 1980s, when Australian researchers Dr. Barry J.

Several furniture and home accessories retailers have opened or are opening soon. The Jonathan Adler contemporary furnishings store (1439 W. Lake St., Mpls., 612-353-5311, www.jonathanadler.com) looks fabulous, but for my money, Adler's merchandise isn't that different from its Uptown neighbor CB2 (3045 Hennepin Av. S., Mpls., 612-821-9303, www.cb2.com), where prices are significantly lower. For a higher price, a consumer should get better construction at Adler, but many customers today have traded down in the price points of their furnishings, said longtime Uptown furniture store owner Pat Fleetham.

There's a painterly quality to the dishes, as if they were composed in a geometrical and orderly way by Mondrian. A salad of heirloom beets, for example, is organized in a Cartesian fashion, a canvas of reds, yellows and orange tones balanced and organized around slivers of smoked cod and set off by sprigs of dill, an elegant affair whose natural beet sugars lend a lush richness to the dish. Another scintillating salad stars yellowtail in both cured and chilled tartare incarnations, composed with paper-thin slices of cucumber and crescents of avocado.

It has been disappointing to see Mayor Dave Bing indulge that level of hot-headedness. Detroiters should look at his record of managing the city -- the massive cost overruns he has permitted in city departments, his slow move to renegotiate costly collective bargaining agreements, and the utter disarray of city services -- to measure whether the imagined threat of outsiders could really be worse than the leadership in place now.

Thrillers are actually my favorite genre. This particular film was a bit daunting because I'm in a lot of the scenes alone, which is a lot of responsibility. If this is a bomb, this is my responsibility. But I can't focus on box office. I have to care about making good movies that entertain. This film is a puzzle and you're constantly trying to figure out the twists and turns. It's such a fun ride.

Whats the difference between these leaders and traditional politicians? Solutions of traditional politicians tend to be incremental and poorly coordinated across the entire economy. They rarely align their policies and commitments with present compelling realities. They tend to equivocate, compromise, procrastinate and ultimately develop intrinsically weak strategies incompatible with the critical solutions that a looming bankruptcy requires. Their calls for unity are not compelling except to ward off perceived common enemies.

Passing a bill designed solely to please his caucus isn't completely crazy or a total waste of time, as the White House insisted, but it is more akin to a Hail Mary pass. Hail Marys do sometimes work in football, and in politics, unlikely bills can sometimes gain surprising life as a legislative deadline approaches. But the speaker's work this week has been an act of desperation, not strength, which was proved Thursday as the conservative sharks (Rep. Michele Bachman, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the tea party group Freedom Works) started openly urging Republican congressmen to vote against the Boehner plan. Whether his bill passes the House when it comes up for a vote this evening is irrelevant. The damage to his leadership is already done.

The fallout falls on Tebow. He has won a playoff game against Pittsburgh. He deserves a shot to start in another NFL city. While Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe tweeted that answered prayers for Manning was proof Tebowing works, anybody who cheered for the Broncos in 2011 should feel gratitude and sympathy for Tebow. This is a tough business. His faith will serve Tebow well now.

Stone, the employment attorney, said it's taken off in part because of an unintended consequence.

The unsure referee consulted with the linesman, a citizen of the Soviet Union. He said, Goal! England went on to win the Cup. Rumor surrounded the linesman's deathbed confession.

We all know that poverty and hunger are on the rise in America, and at the same time we have an obesity epidemic. I'm a fan of Weight Watchers, which I honestly believe can save lives, and I'm also a fan of "easy philanthropy" like the Lose for Good campaign. It rewards people for something they're already doing--not by giving them something, but by helping them give something back. It's a classic win-win. And I'm so grateful that they're including our Food Center in the process.
The lineup analysis tool developed by sabermetric researchers Cyril Morong, Ken Arneson, Ryan Armburst and David Pinto is based on data from 1998 to 2002 to reflect baseball’s current high run-scoring environment. When fed projected statistics for each player, the lineup analysis tool estimates a lineup’s run production capability based on projected on-base percentage and slugging percentages, which are considered the two elements most critical to run production. Player statistics are taken from the Marcels projection system, which bases its forecast on the last four years of a player’s data. Though some lineups are better than others, the differences are slight. A look at how each lineup might perform:

He's still young enough to be entering his prime, but I'm still hoping some of the other young players we signed over the offseason can bear some of the scoring burden. The SPL is not the league it was and is on the verge of losing automatic-qualifying status for Europe. So there is an element of risk here. Then there's the question of how much he will really want to be in Portland and how comfortable he will be with the physical MLS game. There's potential here both for good results and for bad.What do you think of the Kris Boyd signing? Does this give the Timbers the scoring threat that they need? Post your comments below.

In a bipartisan May vote, Ohio's House passed a bill closing loopholes in the state's payday-loan law. In contrast, state Senate Republicans, plainly defying 3.4 million voters, are ignoring the House plan. Before the Nov. 2 election, Ohioans should ask Republican state Senate candidates if they'll let their caucus keep siding with lenders, rather than with voters. And after the Nov. 2 election, assuming there's a traditional lame-duck legislative session, the Senate must pass the House bill.

Funds could still charge loads to individuals at the time of purchase or cover sales costs on an ongoing basis. But the total amount an investor pays would be capped after a set number of years, so that the total wouldn't exceed the amount the investor would have paid had sales costs been covered upfront. For example, a fund that charges a 4 percent sales load could deduct no more than 4 percent over time from an investor not paying upfront.
