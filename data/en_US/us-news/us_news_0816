So many things about books in St. Louis are counterintuitive. Last January, a small independent bookstore announced it might close. By the end of the year, however, Subterranean Books was still alive - but the St. Louis area had lost 10 large chain stores. Not only were independent bookstores still around, several called 2011 one of their best years.
I didn't feel as obligated to tell people that their texts were being saved compared with how I felt the need to tell people their calls were being recorded when I used Calltrunk. I figured if they were writing a message, they knew there was some record of it, however temporary.

"A lot of people tell us how much they admire us for doing this," Brentrup said. "They don't realize how little effort is needed."
Hopefully this will serve to elevate Musial's status. As we know, Musial hasn't always gotten his due. In an embarrassing display of ignorance, fans outside of St. Louis failed to vote Musial to baseball's All-Century team in 1999. (A panel led by baseball Commissioner Bud Selig added Musial to the team.) And Musial was snubbed when ESPN profiled the 50 greatest athletes of the 20th century. Several of Musial's baseball contemporaries were included instead.

Luckily, I found my Villa Katja reservation from Priceline-Europe.com. Some technologically savvy sobe owners post vacancies online, but in Plitvice, sobe signs were everywhere. We wandered to one of three government-owned hotels in this sleepy town and national park, which draws people from around the world. Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is situated on a plateau and separated by natural dams of travertine into 12 upper lakes and four lower lakes formed by runoff from the mountains, forming distinctive colors ranging from green to blue to gray.

Shot in "Mexico Scope" and boasting a blazing title song from Christina Aguilera, Casa de Mi Padre is set somewhere in modern-day Mexico, where the Alvarez ranch - presided over by the aging patriarch Miguel Ernesto (Pedro Armendáriz Jr.) - has fallen on hard times.

Why they’re here: I realize we’re all infatuated with Matt Barkley—as well we should. But don’t be surprised if Tyler Wilson is the best quarterback in the game by the end of the season. Strong arm, terrific feel for the game and tough, tough player who stands tall and isn’t afraid to take a hit. Meanwhile, the Hogs get better every season on defense, and will have their best unit yet under Bobby Petrino in 2012.

During the phase-in period until 2015, companies that don't use green completions voluntarily will be required to burn off the gas instead. Large flares, up to 80 feet tall, burn off much of the volatile organic compounds, one of the components that make smog, but they produce nitrogen oxides, another smog-forming pollutant. The EPA said that green completions reduce the volatile organic compounds released to the air by nearly 95 percent.

I hate my bathroom; we only have one. It has an old tub/shower. We're so busy that we don't use the tub at all, and I want to put a new shower with no tub.

It is precisely this myopia that is lost on Arab populations who see any behavior as reflecting the values of the society at large, and this is why apologies for the behavior of individuals fall on deaf ears.

Caro demonstrates that when, at the Democrats' 1960 Los Angeles convention, John Kennedy selected Johnson, an opponent for the nomination, as his running mate, Robert Kennedy worked with furious dishonesty against his brother, trying to persuade Johnson to decline. Had Robert succeeded, his brother almost certainly would have lost Texas, and perhaps both Carolinas and Louisiana -- President Eisenhower had carried five of the 11 Confederate states in 1956 -- and the election.

How Do We Go?: Logic rules the day at first, as scientists — the forever heroes of ’50s films — coolly build a giant rocket, lay in supplies and choose passengers by lottery. Of course, those not chosen don’t take that lying down — at least, not until the first tidal waves hit.

"I just think it has more force when the person who is in charge of the agency has the imprimatur of Senate approval," said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. "Especially when it's a new agency, you want everything to be perfect. They have a list of regulations to implement, and it's going to be more difficult.

The Chachapoya civilization is believed to have thrived from around 800 to about 1540, the last 70 years or so under the domination of their empire-minded neighbors, the Inca, and then the Spanish. The Chachapoya, historians say, were a loose confederation with settlements spread across a 25,000-square-mile swath of north-central Peru -- an area about the size of West Virginia -- and may have numbered 300,000 people or more at their height.
Broussard said he will stay at ASU through the Las Vegas Bowl.
At Wednesday's debate in Mesa, Ariz., Mitt Romney assailed the administration for cautioning Israel against launching a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Newt Gingrich made it clear that he would react positively if Israel's prime minister informed him that the country planned to attack Iran. And Rick Santorum accused Obama of doing "nothing" to counter "a dangerous theocratic regime that wants to wipe out the state of Israel ... and take on the Great Satan, the United States." Not surprisingly, none of the three gave the administration any credit for ratcheting up the economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran. Nor did any address the potentially catastrophic consequences of an attack on Iran.

The name comes from the resort's founder, Didier Primat, a French-born businessman and environmentalist who purchased the land in 1976 and turned it into a preserve and hunting retreat. Golf entered the picture with the opening of the aptly-named Highland Course in 2006, located on top of a mountain plateau a few miles from the Blue Ridge Parkway. Designed by acclaimed British golf course architect Donald Steel, the course teeters on the edge of the ridge line at certain points, offering stunning views of the river gorge and surrounding mountain peaks. While many high-altitude courses are cradled in mountain valleys, at Primland the valleys are below, making it feel like you're golfing on top of the world. Imagine playing links around the rim of the Grand Canyon, only the canyon is filled with trees.
Not everything deserves a rave, not even every burger, but, all in all, Short Order is a fine addition to the sprawling complex at Fairfax and 3rd. Now when you emerge from a late-night film at the Grove, Short Order will probably still be serving — till 1 a.m. on the weekends, 11 p.m. weekdays. Remember, it's a simple restaurant — what burger place isn't? — that mostly does what it's supposed to do: well-executed comfort food for a reasonable price.
All of that is legal under existing rules, and that's why we needed Prop B.

On July 3, 2002, "Lt. Commander Bobby Thompson'' — a stolen identity and a made-up title — applied for tax-exempt status for the U.S. Navy Veterans.

The O's need to win because they shouldn't go home 5-5 after starting out 5-2. They need to win because they should not have looked so much like the 2011 midseason Orioles on Saturday night. They need to win because Angels starter Dan Haren is beatable and a 6-4 finish on the trip would be uplifting while a 5-5 finish (which would leave the O's with a .500 overall record) would be a big letdown.
Horner has two specific areas he definitely wants to see his team excel at on Friday to help give it a good chance to win.
Some people want state monopolies on liquor to remain because they feel safer with government in charge. They believe that more limited access and price controls mean that the social problems associated with overconsumption are limited, as well. But that's naive.

But Bianchi told the jury even if they believe the sexual allegations against Hinds, it still didn’t meet the standards for a passion/provocation manslaughter defense.

A: Yeah, because think of the way the grid runs. The grid runs in real time. As the system ramps up, the system doesn't peak at noon (when PV output does), it peaks at 4. So as the system's ramping up and my PV resource is falling off, I've got to back it up with natural gas, with hydro, with something that's not free. That's a real cost to the utility. That cost puts a burden of 30 to 50 percent on PV.
As schools are investing in technology - Apple says there are more than 1.5 million iPads in educational institutions already - some caution that simply buying the latest device will not lead to gains in student performance. Work needs to be done to ensure the technology is integrated into classrooms and teaching methods and curriculum are aligned to standards, said Thomas C. Reeves, a professor emeritus of learning, design and technology at the University of Georgia.

Yeesh! The judges say both Casanova and Peach surprised them on the winning team. But the losing team -- eeek. Nina says, "it was really horrifying." Heidi says Gretchen had a lot to say. Michael says Gretchen had too much to say. Nina says she changed her tune. Michael says it's easy to throw someone under the bus who has immunity. They're not pleased with Ivy's outfit, either, which someone says is "hideous." Heidi says Gretchen was driving that bus, and Michael wonders how much design she did, or if her job was just bossing everyone around. All in all, Team Luxe should have been smart and self-sufficient, and they weren't, say the judges.
A few days later, Kaptur took to the House floor to deliver her own take on those trade agreements.

Mr. Schäuble, the elder statesman of the German cabinet and an unapologetic Europhile, spent much of the 10-hour flight encouraging Ms. Merkel to change her tune. She realized Germany needed to do more. The nation, he argued, had to help others in order to help itself.

On the first Earth Day, I was a junior at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and I remember spending some hours cutting weeds and cleaning trash out of a creek which ran near our dorm complex. It was a good feeling, remembering that the planet does not belong to us but that it's been entrusted to our care. I have a question. Every day I see motorists who smoke while driving, distractedly dangling their cigarettes out the car window, haphazardly flicking their sinister gray ashes onto the roadways, often carried away by the breeze. It's been eons since I heard of vehicles coming equipped with ashtrays and why would responsible smokers light up with other non-smokers in their cars. So my question is, what happens to all the leftover cigarette ashes and twisted soggy cigarette butts? They don't go in any of the Recology containers, at least not the ones here in San Carlos. All the butts and ashes, where do they wind up other than wasting away on countless highways and byways?

Latin America and the Caribbean are already experiencing significant effects from climate change. In the Andes, for instance, tropical glaciers are melting at such a pace that some could simply be gone in 10 to 20 years. Aside from the effect on biodiversity -- the eastern slopes of the Andes are the single most biologically diverse area in the world -- glacier disappearance will have a tremendous economic influence on some of the region's poorest residents. The World Bank is supporting Latin America's environmental efforts with loans totaling $3.7 billion for the 2008-2009 period. But much more will be needed, to scale up adaptation efforts and also to finance the acquisition of technologies to curb emissions.

And though American troops fought valiantly despite such missteps, in many cases performing acts of heroism and sacrifice well beyond the call of duty, they weren't always treated well by the country that sent them to war. For years, wounded veterans were housed under deplorable conditions in the old Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital in Washington until a public outcry forced its closure. The Army was also slow to acknowledge the needs of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and the effects of repeated concussions suffered on the battlefield. The mishandling of soldiers' remains at Arlington National Cemetery and elsewhere was a deplorable insult to grieving families.

Mexican cruises: Mexico remains under a cloud and has cast a troubling shadow over cruises from the port of Los Angeles and elsewhere. Drug-cartel wars in border areas and the interior create the mistaken perception that ports along the Mexican Riviera also are riddled with violence — one many travel agents and cruise watchers say is unwarranted. "My personal message is that Mexico is alive and well, and I encourage people to look into it," McClure-Mysza said.
In addition to discouraging screen time for young kids, the national pediatricians organization, based in Elk Grove Village, warned against watching TV with them nearby, saying the practice hurts language development. It pointed to several studies, including one from 2008 that found background TV reduced the length of time they played and caused their focus on play to stray.

Rodriguez said the Gurabo is a social club in the traditional sense of the term — hardly a night club. Members are "nice people" who usually go to the club to enjoy good music and talk into the night.
It is tragic that anyone can still think that one man's life can be improved by robbing another. We are all united, as French citizens and as a human society. It is in all our interests to encourage each other to give the best of ourselves, and to defend each other's right to the just rewards. France is suffering from the effects of decades of slow growth and high unemployment, and even worse from a younger generation that is losing hope for a better future.
His most recent project was advising Arizona officials on a new law that empowers police to question anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally.

* For the purposes of conversation, though, let's pretend that Washington does sign Manning. First of all, even if the Redskins didn't get Manning, there's no guarantee that they'd be willing to be aggressive and give up a lot to move up to secure that No. 2 spot. But with Manning in D.C. the Rams would lose an attractive trade partner for that No. 2 pick. And let's say that the Cleveland Browns are content to hold onto the No. 4 overall pick, and keep their other first-round selection (No. 22) to build a better team around third-year QB Colt McCoy. The Browns have a lot of holes to fill; maybe it would be unwise for them to sacrifice so many valuable draft choice to land Baylor QB Robert Griffin III. (I don't know what the Browns' plan is; I don't think the Browns know what their plan is. Say, didn't you used to be Mike Holmgren?)
