NJPAC also sold concert-only tickets. In all, some 2,000 people enjoyed the show.
The Monsters took a 1-0 lead at 1:56 of the third and have a penalty, in part, to thank. Winger Ryan Stoa came out of the box, grabbed the puck in the neutral zone and got a half-step on his man.

Jerome Harris, chairman of the New Jersey Black Issues Convention and a member of the coalition, said he’s concerned that Democrats dropped a proposal to create a Perth Amboy to New Brunswick district intended to slightly increase Hispanic clout. He also said he’s afraid Democrats are wavering on a plan to cut Hawthorne out of the 35th Legislative District, giving Assemblywoman Nelly Pou (D-Passaic), who is Hispanic, a chance to run for an open state Senate seat.
“The taxpayers of Ohio who are footing the bill for all of this, in the end, need to realize how generous the public-pension systems — all of them — are compared to private-sector retirement plans,” Wachtmann said. “Most of our private-sector employers would go bankrupt if they had to pay the kind of money into employee retirements that our public-sector employers do.”
When the weather is cooperative, Nary spends hours by the pool, where he watches "the water go around" but never takes a swim. He searches the sky for sandhill cranes and signs of rain. He looks for deer and fox and other creatures in the woodsy fields around the house. He listens to country music on the radio. Most of all, he waits for a visit from Jalyssa Carter, Krista's 19-year-old daughter, and her 16-month-old son, Gaje, who reaches for his great-grandpa and buries his face in his scratchy beard.

On another visit, when a fall chill was in the air, the meal kicked off with a tureen of cannellini bean soup large enough for seconds and thirds. The rich broth was fortified with lardons of bacon, two sizes of beans, chunks of carrots and gauzy leaves of wilted escarole, and the flavors were nurturing and warm.

A high number of mountain lion episodes occur in April and May for two reasons: The lions are out hunting fawns, and better weather makes for more people venturing into the parks.
Phelps has five world records in five finals. He's making it look so effortless I'm not sure we're properly appreciating the degree of difficulty. And that was none too evident by the shrugs of the world Wednesday when Phelps overcame a healthy amount of adversity in the pool -- he said after he couldn't see the wall on the turns -- and still got out of the water in perfect shape.
Pujols' eight-year, $111 million extension expired at the end of the Cardinals' second championship season in five years, leaving some to believe that the team's competitiveness and positive outlook might factor in upcoming negotiations. Until shortly after Holliday's signing Pujols publicly professed a willingness to take a "discount" to remain with the organization that selected him in the 13th round of the 1999 amateur draft then watched his lightning development into the 2001 NL Rookie of the Year. But neither Pujols nor Lozano ever defined what such a discount would be based upon, and the notion quickly faded after the Phillies granted Howard a five-year, $125 million extension in May 2010.

To his credit, Obama seems to understand this. Last weekend at the Group of 7 summit in Rome, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner went out of his way to assure restive finance ministers that Washington remains committed to free trade. Obama himself spoke out against the Buy American provision earlier this month. But he also doesn't shy away from pandering to the Democratic Party's anti-trade wing, going so far as saying during the presidential campaign that the North American Free Trade Agreement should be renegotiated (a political maneuver that was undercut when Obama's economic advisors privately told Canadian officials that the candidate didn't really mean it).

Reasons for optimism: Thomas, who has changed his jersey number from 1 to 5, had arguably the best season ever for a Ducks quarterback in 2010. And he did it as a sophomore. Thomas combined the passing prowess of the Ducks' first spread-option quarterback, Kellen Clemens, with occasional slipperiness in the fashion of Dennis Dixon and Jeremiah Masoli. The results were 2,881 yards passing and 30 touchdowns with just nine interceptions to go along with 486 yards with five scores. What made Thomas' performance even more impressive was that he made key throws in the face of heavy pressure and while taking hits. "I think the one thing that I remarked and I said it a lot last year is that it almost seemed like every week he just got better and better," Oregon coach Chip Kelly said. "There are new facets to his game that he continues to work on."

Eamonn Brennan, ESPN.com: "The Wildcats enter March as the clear national title favorite. The loss to Vanderbilt in the SEC championship game aside, they absolutely, often effortlessly, destroyed the SEC. They pair a brilliant pressure-packed defense with one of the nation's best (and, thanks to all the defensive talk, most underrated) offenses. Had Christian Watford's December buzzer-beater rimmed out in Assembly Hall, the Wildcats would be walking into this tournament undefeated, we'd already be crowning their you-know-whats and we'd be less concerned with whether they won the national title than where they belonged in the pantheon of college basketball's all-time greatest teams."

Judge Charles Burns has placed a gag order on lawyers, so it's uncertain whom prosecutors plan to put on the stand.

That is in line with Jeter’s career .339 average against lefties, which right now is the best produced since divisional play began in 1969 (minimum 2,000 plate appearances vs. lefties). Think about that. With all the offense of the past 40-plus years, no one has hit southpaws with the batting average success of Jeter.

It's not frothy entertainment. Although illuminated by gentle humor and warm characterizations, the three-hour-long “Convert” is intense, harrowing and flatteringly demanding. Gurira refuses to condescend to her audience, either in her storytelling — entire scenes are performed in the Shona dialect — or in her moral position, offering no clear-cut villains or heroes. Brought to life by Emily Mann’s subtle direction, a splendid set by Daniel Ostling and a variety of astonishing performances, the play is compelling in spite of an unpersuasive, melodramatic finale.

A: For all intents and purposes, yeah. It was a very difficult decision for my parents to accept, for me to drop out of high school to start acting. They thought, "You're dropping out of high school? No Hammer man has even dropped out of college without getting an MBA or a Ph.D." or this and that. They wanted me to go to Columbia. That was the goal. "You're going to go to Columbia! There's a building there!" No, I'm really not. Sorry. I'm glad that works for you, but I've got to do this. I've found my passion.

There are so many more restaurants these days than in the Sacramento of 1959. And with the economy in a prolonged stall, pricing is more competitive than ever.

We pay in uncertainty about will happen next.
A national survey of small-business owners, also released Tuesday, showed declining optimism among owners of small businesses, the third straight monthly drop.

I think what it says is they don't want to pay starting small forward money to two people (Batum needs to be extended) right or wrong they think Batum is the future. It hurts the team in the immediate future, but three first round draft picks is pretty unheard of for what amounts to a hustle player. Its something you have to at least look at.

Critics of charters tend to focus on three main arguments: Charters "cherry pick" the best students from traditional schools; kick out students who do poorly; and serve far fewer special education students and non-English speakers than traditional schools.

President Obama gets it. So did President Eisenhower half a century ago. When you are breaking a decades-long legislative logjam, you take what you can get so you can do better later.
But Mr. Obama promised to change that. He was tired of the timid, almost apologetic talk. He was going to be an FDR, or at least a Reagan for liberalism. He was going to "fundamentally transform" the country. And to those who counseled that Democrats can't govern that way, Mr. Obama and his followers responded with shouts of "Yes, we can!"

The Rockies desperately need a starter to step up and take on some innings. Can right-hander Juan Nicasio be that guy tonight vs. the Dodgers? So far during this homestand, Rockies starters have gone four innings (Drew Pomeranz on Friday), five innings (Guillermo Moscoso, Saturday) and five innings (Jamie Moyer, Sunday). Nicasio is coming off a solid outing in Pittsburgh, where he pitched 6-2/3 innings in a no-decision. He scattered nine hits, allowed one run and struck out five. Trouble is, the Dodgers knocked Nicasio around pretty good in the two games they've faced him. He's 0-1 with a 7.59 ERA against Los Angeles. Dodgers slugger Matt Kemp is 3-for-6 with a home and three RBIs against Nicasio.

The site breaks down the complex calendar gymnastics behind the need for a leap year. Short answer: Earth doesn't revolve around the sun in precisely 365 days, so we add a day -- Feb. 29 -- into the calendar every fourth year to synchronize.

Colaiacovo got a little carried away trying to screen Joe Thornton on a dump-and-chase. The result was an interference penalty the Blues barely killed. The Blues can't take needless penalties against a team with this sort of firepower.
Still, Torres wants to play in today’s game against the Yankees. His presence in that game would effectively lock him into the Opening Day roster. The team would lose its ability to back-date him on the disabled list, and Torres remains jumpy and rusty at the plate.
• Andy Vasquez of the Bergen Record writes that Nets fans should be "giddy" over the rapport that's being built between Gerald Wallace and point guard Deron Williams. Wallace is one of those places. He’s also helped his backup, Gerald Green, become a better small forward, and he’s had an impact on the games of MarShon Brooks and Anthony Morrow. With Wallace acclimated to the lineup, the Nets look like a different team. A better team.
The policy provides a more cumbersome replacement to the gun ban previously established by the board through an administrative rule, which was struck down last fall by the Oregon Court of Appeals. The court ruled only the Legislature had authority to regulate guns.
This is Romney's true radicalism. I suspect it is a principled radicalism. And exposing its implications will be Obama's opening to make the campaign about something other the economy, stupid. Romney's speech on Tuesday was every bit as important as his supporters said it was. It contained both the foundation of an effective campaign based on the electorate's discontents, and the basis for undermining the very argument Romney wants to make.

The first course, by Paola Garduño of Café O in Mexico City, looked like an impressionist's idea of spring. Tiny shoots of herbs and flowers fluttered around a circle of fresh, firm white cheese topped with tender peas. The slightly acidic Silvana, a chenin blanc-sauvignon blanc-viognier-moscatel blend from Viñas Pijoan, highlighted the tartness in the tomatillo salsa and sizzled against the creamy cheese.

Pros: Cirque du Soleil poured $50 million into its 2003 entry into the Vegas adult entertainment show business, and every dollar of it seems to have been spent to create a unique and credible sequence of scenes exhibiting both impressive sex appeal as well as the sort of eye-popping athleticism that the Montreal circus troupe is known for. The intimacy of the theater and the live music provided cues that this would be a high-quality endeavor, and even the scene that could have been crass and exploitative -- two topless women frolicking together in a gigantic fishbowl -- was executed with sensuous grace thanks to beautiful synchonized-swimming choreography.

Manager Ron Gardenhire and pitching coach Rick Anderson have frequently espoused favorable views of the strategy, and gone so far as to suggest their starter with the best strikeout arsenal, Francisco Liriano, learn to embrace the "pitch to contact" philosophy. That has made Gardenhire and Anderson targets for criticism on message boards and talk radio, a bit confusing in itself since almost every major league team now embraces pitch to contact, and the Twins have utilized it for decades.

The battle wouldn't have suffered from a lack of funds, however, at least initially. Wealthy donors from New York and other parts of the country had been pledging their support for months and offered to spend millions of dollars on a potential campaign.

And that will continue. Expect the Buckeyes to go to their bench for any real significant playing time -- other than Sam Thompson sharing the two-guard sport with Lenzelle Smith Jr. -- only during blowouts in the tournament or in cases of foul trouble. This is on the starters, with the bench averaging just 6.2 points per game in the 16 games Ohio State played this season against NCAA Tournament teams. The bench averaged 18.8 points in the 18 games against teams not in the tournament.
