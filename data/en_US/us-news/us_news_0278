Whether that be our Broadway Cabaret Series, which has done really well this year, we added a second weekend of performances for our cabaret. We, myself and the whole board, want to have a return to producing new works. Both classic and musical in nature. As thrilling as it is to put on a play that's consistently been done or put it on in a new way, I think there's nothing like producing new work.

Do you raise the money you need to spend on upgrading, on traveling, on bringing in (recruits) in order to win? Or do you win in order to raise money?

Since at least as far back as 1970, the city has not had to borrow money through the bond process. Forty-two years. The opponents want you to believe that as soon as the measures pass they will need to borrow money immediately. Let's be serious. For more than 42 years, they have been able to manage. If they did need to borrow money, there would be plenty of time for an election.

5. Interleague play agrees with Albert Pujols. The Cardinals' first baseman is annually one of the top hitters in interleague play. (No surprise, he's annually one of the top hitters in any play.) Last summer, his .409 average was third best in baseball and his nine home runs in interleague play were the most. His 19 RBIs trailed only Hanley Ramirez's 24 throughout the majors. Those were just continuations of a trend for Pujols. Four times in his career, Pujols has hit better than .400 during interleague play, including in each of the past three seasons. Here's what Pujols has done from
Silky Sullivan's held its annual Chili Cookoff on Sunday. Starting originally as a informal chili event with a few employees some 20 years ago, it has grown every year to this year's 23 entrants accompanied by live entertainment. Free to both chili cookoff entrants and chili aficionados, Silky Sullivan's Chili Cookoff developed into a fun event for people to show their chili cooking prowess and for people to enjoy it.

The camp Erdogan visited houses more than 9,500 refugees. Two were killed there by cross-border fire from Syria last month. It is the most organized of the camps and looks like a small town with wide streets, soup kitchens, a health clinic and even a makeshift barber shop.
The national reform environment puts pressure on Oregon from above, she says. Impatience at the local level adds pressure from below. More than a dozen local superintendents joined forces recently to create better state policy. Parents, teachers and even some politicians seem hungry to set aside politics as usual.
"Do you have what it takes?" I would ask would-be business-starters. During my years as a counselor, I talked to small-business owners to gain perspective on just what it takes. I've found work ethic is an indicator of entrepreneurial potential.

In Tampa Bay, Schiano takes over a team that finished this season with a 4-12 record, including 10 consecutive loses. He replaces the fired Raheem Morris, who is a native of Irvington.
While the discussion today is focused on Huron Hospital, the bigger issue is how we reconfigure our health care resources to best serve a population with significant needs. Many who object to the decision to close Huron Hospital have expressed the thought that surely the Cleveland Clinic has enough resources to continue its subsidy of Huron Hospital, and that is almost certainly true. But that would be a decision to use the community's scarce health care resources to preserve bricks and mortar over an investment in improving and preserving the health of our community. In that context, I believe the Cleveland Clinic's decision to invest millions of dollars to build and operate a family health center in East Cleveland to meet the real needs of that community is the essence of Huron Hospital's long history and important mission.
The buildup of mercury from vapors 24 hours a day, over a lifetime, is the greatest concern, said Boyd Haley, retired professor emeritus at the University of Kentucky, where he headed the chemistry department. Eighty percent of mercury vapor stays in body tissue for days, months, even years, because the body doesn't have a good system for excreting it, he said. Cadaver studies have shown that bodies with more amalgam fillings have more mercury in their brain tissue.
At this time there are no California wines, although Lynch mentioned that he's working to incorporate some. For some of us, looking over the list is like reading Greek, but with Lynch as the translator, it's hard to go wrong.
A few minutes later, they shook hands again and embraced briefly after the pregame captains' meeting. They repeated the ritual before tipoff.
Even so, Quinn's behavior is scarily reminiscent. Never admit fault and always blame the Legislature when something goes wrong. Hold big, splashy Chicago news conferences rather than do the actual hard work of quiet governance.
Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts declined to comment, saying the governor would hold off until the bills land on his desk.

But in a cost-cutting move more than three decades ago, the state got out of less-serious misdemeanor probation, leaving individual counties to handle people sentenced for crimes such as petty theft or marijuana possession. In 1975, the Legislature passed the Salvation Army Act, which allowed the church to run probation programs for counties.
When the case broke in April, the transcripts opened a window into a massive insider trading case that netted more than $37 million, according to prosecutors. And it also revealed something else — a focus by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey on Wall Street-type corruption that many say is typically handled almost exclusively across the river by New York’s Southern District.
In therapy, Evan worked on proprioception -- the sense of knowing where his limbs are. Like all children, he needs to understand his feet are under him before he figures out how to stand.
Once you get inside the Alliance Theatre, take a moment to stand in awe of Todd Rosenthal’s spectacularly spooky scenic design. Moss hangs from the rafters, and a dilapidated water tower ominously overlooks the skeletal frame of an eerily empty cabin.
"If this plan goes away, we will probably end up with piecemeal, haphazard development, never reaching the potential before us now," said Ralph Tahran. "I think that's a very sad, missed opportunity that contributes very little to the vitality of our developing downtown district."
Given how the 2010 congressional elections played out, that may not be so surprising. According to the website opensecrets.org, outside spending by liberal groups had typically outstripped that by conservative groups in recent elections. But that flipped in 2010. Behind huge efforts by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Action Network and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS, conservative groups spent twice as much as liberal ones in that year. Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives and picked up seats in the Senate, as well as hundreds of seats in state legislatures.

Second, it isn't just poor and minority students who drop out; white kids do, too, at alarming rates. In fact, a majority of Portland's dropouts are white, only half qualify for subsidized school meals, and
"Restoring the Everglades is more important than ever," said Paul Souza, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service supervisor in Vero Beach. "We can improve the health of species, which will give many of them more of a chance to adapt to impacts."
Additionally, a majority of students from two local K-8 private schools – Orange Crescent in Garden Grove and Shoreline Christian in Fountain Valley – typically enroll here after the eighth grade, Herzfeld said. Orange Crescent, a Muslim school, has even worked with Fountain Valley to align its curriculum more closely to the high school's, Herzfeld said.
Observers say some regions that presumably have pacts with criminal groups are kept "safe," but other areas seemingly live under an unofficial curfew, in fear of kidnappings and attacks on women.
Legislative leaders this month are supporting a tentative budget plan to help fill new holes, such as a recently projected drop in revenues of $35 million. But even if the federal help to reward Oregon's health reform arrives, it won't be a panacea, legisative leaders and Gov. John Kitzhaber say.

This is a belief, as the existence of Santa Claus is a belief. Neither belief will stand scrutiny, but belief alone is a powerful force. Why else (besides the cynical pursuit of votes) would lawmakers be willing to waste what potentially could be millions of scarce public dollars on purely mean legislation during tough economic times?
Hey, Mitch: The Browns' pro personnel department has to do a thorough job of examining Flynn and projecting him as a starting quarterback. There's not much video of him in the NFL. They shouldn't trust McCarthy's personal opinion. They have to evaluate him on his skills -- not the skills of players around him. They must decide whether Flynn is the next Matt Schaub or the next Kevin Kolb, or something in between. The question should be: Can Flynn take the Browns to the Super Bowl? The question should not be: Is Flynn better than Colt McCoy? Keep in mind that Flynn was a seventh-round draft choice. There are reasons for that.

To call "In Other Worlds" a defense of science fiction isn't accurate. Yes, there is a thread of self-justification here. She does address how a serious novelist with a worldwide reputation would spend her time in genres regarded by the monolithic, anonymous literati as shallow and escapist. In her words:
Down narrow, dank Cooper Alley off Jackson Street, which was set aside a century ago for sick Chinese prostitutes, a small building built in 1908 is home to people like Qiang-guo Wang, 69, who rents a small room with his wife for $240 a month.

But after Akron's last, proud surge, and after a replay review by officials confirmed that Zeke Marshall did not score on a tying tip-in in the last 3 seconds, and after Quincy Diggs' wild heave hit nothing as the red lights ending the game framed the backboards, the final judgment was that the MAC's current and future best had met and given us one for the memories.
Winner of five Tony Awards in 2006, this sparkling show begins when a die-hard Broadway musical fan plays his favorite cast album – a 1928 smash hit called “The Drowsy Chaperone” – and the show magically appears in his apartment. The audience is instantly immersed in the glamorous, madcap tale of a celebrity bride and her uproarious wedding day, complete with the Broadway producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials, her eccentric chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorus girl, the Latin lover and a pair of gangsters who double as pastry chefs. Its side-splitting humor and fizzy score will entertain both young and old.

A few days later, I was in Huntington Beach and was talking to my pal George "Mayor of Main Street" Lambert, and we started talking about that final. He had seen it too, while sitting at his desk at Huntington Beach Realty. He pointed out that Fanning had pulled off some big smooth power turns and that the wave at Bell's was really more set up for that kind of surfing than the big aerials and flash moves that Slater was pulling off. Great point.

"I'm just glad it's over, so I can get started on next year's classic," Waters said.
She also disagreed with the assessment of the auditor's office that Nixon's withholdings were unconstitutional, saying the governor has a responsibility to balance the state's budget when revenues don't keep pace with expenditures. Since lawmakers created an appropriation for disaster recovery, and because the anticipated spending could be immense, the governor had to make budget adjustments.
Although legislation has yet to be introduced, many lawmakers agree the most likely first step toward immigration legislation is a requirement that all businesses use E-Verify. The E-Verify program lets businesses know whether employees have the necessary papers to work in the U.S. Such legislation could give Democrats political cover by addressing immigration requirements that preclude tough crackdowns on immigrants, and give Republicans an opportunity to say they provided a new enforcement tool to stop illegal immigration.
Romley told The Arizona Republic that those immigration "strategies" were less successful than they were touted to be.
It’s a system that’s been in place in New Jersey since the early 1950s, one that allows parents and children to plead their cases in front of other town residents.

Palmer, 62, is regarded as one of best all-around athletes to come out of Arizona, and he even added a little comedy as well. He managed to sneak into a girls football game where he punted the ball. It was a booming kick that surprised everyone in the crowd until the kicker got back to the sideline, took off his helmet to reveal it was Palmer.
"We focus on volume sales, so that means our margin is very limited," said Allen Chen, 42. "So if the exchange rate appreciates even 2 percent or 5 percent, that would hurt us."

Would fill a huge need on the Browns given the free-agent departure of Peyton Hillis and injury questions surrounding Montario Hardesty. Did not run at the combine because of a knee scope, but he did run at his pro day in late March and was outstanding. A large contingent of Browns personnel watched. Browns President Mike Holmgren no doubt remembers the 2000 draft, when his Seahawks drafted a 5-11, 225-pound stud of a running back from Alabama at 19th overall. Shaun Alexander eventually helped the Seahawks and Holmgren get to the Super Bowl.
When it opened in 1956, the Capitol Records building was surrounded mostly by surface parking lots, making it easy to spot from the nearby — and brand-new — Hollywood Freeway. The cylindrical design for the building, by Welton Becket and a young architect in Becket's office, Louis Naidorf, played beautifully to its mobile audience and that wide-open urban landscape. The result was a 13-story tower with the confidence and allure of a major skyscraper.
Who wouldn't want to get paid to go shopping? That's partly the allure behind "mystery shopper" scams.
That expansion in to the juvenile courts has apparently chafed Phillips. He said early projections for the office overestimated the number of cases that would be handled and now the office is trying to drum up business.
It didn't take long to learn that Wallace was up to his same old tricks -- struggling on the road. After a nice ovation from the Rose Garden crowd during pregame introductions, Wallace had three early field goal attempts emphatically blocked by J.J.

In 1998, Macias was waiting tables in his hometown of Rosarito in Baja California. His younger brother was moving to San Francisco, where other members of the family lived, so Macias took some time off to help him move. He had visited the city several times, but never thought of immigrating.
Asked if he was part of the group holding local control hostage, Crowell said: "If that helps get tax credit reform passed, I'm part of it. If it doesn't, I'm not part of it."

Today's scene is less glamorous, given that downtown Mexico City's historic core has seen better days. However, Café de Tacuba is still a national landmark. It is a prerequisite for visitors to the capital and a place where the food is traditional and quintessentially Mexican. In fact, the menu proudly states that the tamales are made with manteca (lard), "as the tradition requires," and they are accompanied by atole, a heavy, hot drink made from corn flour, water, unrefined cane sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate.

This report did not specify which insurers could owe rebates in the large-group market.
Our guess is not. If President Barack Obama was really trying to give a wink and a nod to supporters of marriage equality, Mr. Biden would be far from the ideal messenger. Although he is the second-highest elected official in the land, he is so gaffe-prone (remember the line from 2007 about his future boss being "articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy"?) that he lacks much punch as a strategic leaker of the administration's intentions.
A trust owned by the United Auto Workers  but not directly managed by the union  received a 17.5 percent ownership stake in GM in return for taking over the health care costs of blue-collar retirees. That stake declined as the company left government ownership by selling stock to the public; it's now about 10 percent. In return for its share, the UAW could not strike over wages at Chrysler or GM in the last round of contract talks, and it gave other concessions too.

Little La Lune In Long Beach's Cambodia Town, the reborn Little La Lune in a quiet strip mall is a contemporary Cambodian cafe designed for a new generation. Slurp up the Phnom Penh noodle soup. It's a surfeit of seafood: pillowy fish balls, plump shrimp, rings of squid, dried baby shrimp, rice noodles, cilantro and fried garlic. The soup is the standard by which many Cambodia Town restaurants are measured, and Little La Lune's is very good — a polished broth that tastes faintly of the ocean, seafood that embodies its provenance. Thai flavors prevail in the crispy noodle salad: a nest of fried egg noodles, shredded cabbage and carrots, bean sprouts, cilantro, scallion, mint, crushed peanuts, slices of just-grilled beef and a lime-laced dressing.

Herter Brothers, the architectural decorators of choice for the robber barons and other rich Americans of that extravagant era, had the mantelpiece carved by the famed Paris firm Guére Frère. It depicts imagery associated with the landed European gentry that wealthy Americans sought to emulate. There's a forest scene of a wild boar being attacked by four hunting dogs, and a pair of life-size hounds flanking the fireplace. With its high-relief carving of fruit garlands, rosettes and acanthus leaves, the work is typical of the Second Empire style popularized by Napoleon III.
Nothing new to report on that other than the fact that sophomore Malcolm Agnew returned to practice after missing some time with a sore hamstring.
The additions of Jamie Langenbrunner, Jason Arnott and Scott Nichol give them added depth that is proven at the NHL level. This team finished 10th in the NHL in goals scored last season - without the three new vets and with several key offensive players missing big chunks of the season - and that was after a mediocre first half. The arrivals of Chris Stewart and Kevin Shattenkirk played a large role in that improvement and they'll be around from the start this season.

Just cleaned out my fridge and threw away some meat that was older than she. Her singing continues to be awesome and astounding. She put the "proud" in "Proud Mary". Loved the way she executed "You Are So Beautiful." Nicely measured and paced so that you could hear the beauty and quality of her singing voice. Her vocal abilities are truly of another world. She exudes a professionalism and a stage presence of an exceptional and experienced artist yet is short of being a "diva" (in the bad or negative sense of the word).

Hill and co-star Channing Tatum play nicely off their own images. The slightly slimmed-down Hill is still playing the kid with the kick-me sign here, and reveling in it. (A high school flashback — showing him as a desperate Eminem wannabe — is particularly nasty fun.) And Tatum, a simple slab of beef in more serious movies, finds a new freedom in comedy, making fun of his dumb-stud persona and partnering nicely with Hill in some back-and-forth comedy.

We've seen all this before, haven't we? The infrastructural guts of the modern city as a setting for explosions, gunfights and increasingly manic race-the-clock scenarios? How many movie heroes have climbed atop an elevator, as the character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt does? How many more have plotted an ingenious route through a building's air ducts? These places aren't new. They're architectural clichés, dredged up from Hollywood's collective memory bank.

But Cal State erodes the public's trust when it moves, as a panel of trustees did Tuesday, to raise the salaries of two new campus presidents by 10%, to more than $300,000 a year, and to provide generous perks. The increases don't cost enough to have a meaningful impact on Cal State admissions, but they indicate an appalling lack of concern about the troubles that students face and imply that the university can find extra money when it wants to. The incoming president of Cal State Fullerton, Mildred Garcia, has been the president of Cal State Dominguez Hills since 2007, earning a $295,000 salary. It's unclear why she needed a double-digit increase to take on a parallel job within commuting distance of her current campus, especially during such pressing times, except that the university's policy allows raises of that much and no more.

The Eagles, one league source explained, are also open to a trade for Jackson. In other words, the Eagles wouldn't mind if some sucker, er, team, took Jackson off their hands for a nice piece of draft compensation.

We hope that this explanation gives some light as to the financial disagreements we have as we proceed through this cycle. The minority makes decisions and casts votes not because we just want to be disagreeable. We cast these votes because we have real concerns about the financial road map that the majority is presenting. We need to make good, hard decisions in these tough economic times, not decisions that will hurt our financial stability in the future.

Devotees of The Clientele divide into two schools of thought. The first argues that the addition of occasional strings, piano, pedal steel and synths to the group’s gentle psych-pop has forced the spotlight from the group’s great strength: Alasdair MacLean’s intricately woven guitar parts. The other believes that the Clientele did the original style to death in the early ’00s, so they might as well conduct some experiments.
But the truth is that this is a journey, and often a painful one; it’s especially disheartening to hear about people who specifically choose a career that focuses on serving the special needs members of our society mistreating and devaluing these same individuals. If our loved ones can be abused and discriminated against at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them, who do we trust? Where do we go from there?
There are other reasons that the choice of a vice president is particularly important today. Vice presidents have increasingly become players in politics and governing. Cheney was the most noteworthy example, and Biden also seems to be a prominent administration player. In fact, this is a relatively recent trend. For much of its history, the position was seen as "not worth a bucket of warm spit" -- in the cleaned-up gibe of FDR's first vice president, John Nance Garner.

We knew this was going to happen. Most pitchers coming off Tommy John need time to get back to where they were. It probably will take Wainwright another month or two to get there, but I haven't changed my mind on him one bit from where I had him in the preseason at 21 among starting pitchers. You don't have to trade for him this week, but you should do it soon.

Johnson built the program, with the help of coaches Charise Moore and Deb Martin, from scratch. Liberty reached the state tournament's first round in its first two varsity seasons, but never got past it.
"Breakout Nations" works best as a compilation of highly illuminating country vignettes—similar, say, to Michael Lewis' "Boomerang" (2011)—rather than an overarching analysis. But this is hardly an affront. As with Mr. Lewis' work on the European crisis, for sheer readability and insight on the various parts of the ongoing developing world drama, I dare say you won't find a better choice.

øA bomber arms race ensued afterward, resulting in planes such as the four-engined B-17 and during World War II, the Norden bombsight, which supposedly accounted for wind speed and direction. "It was supposed to be very accurate, but they still had trouble dropping a bomb 'in the pickle barrel' as they said then," Crouch says. The area bombing of World War II, which obliterated cities such as Dresden and Tokyo, was partly a result of this inaccuracy, he adds.
"These guys fought a war," McDonald said. "We won a war in four years, when now the area they're fighting in is no bigger than Texas, and they've been there 10 years, and it's sad. We had a reason to fight. We wanted to be free."

Some of the best wildlife game-viewing in South Africa is at Kruger National Park -- which is convenient if you're headed to watch a match in the nearby city of Nelspruit, or if you've set aside a few days for travel around the country. But for travelers who want to grab game encounters closer to Johannesburg, Pilanesburg Game Reserve (www.pilanesberg-game-reserve.co.za) is an easier choice, about 90 minutes from Johannesburg or Pretoria, next door to the Sun City casino and entertainment complex.

Our values are homo values, that's for certain. We put the phrase "sex positive" on the map. My friend Dr. Carol Queen, a sexologist and multi-decade San Francisco sex activist and educator, agrees: "Sex-positivity itself is a notion that developed here and continues to spread like a healing meme, an alternative to the right-wing idea that sex is primarily for making babies and giving straight people an excuse to get married (except when you really need to call a gay hooker with some meth to help you unwind, and even then it's dangerous and problematic). Short definition of sex-positivity: the notion that sexuality is or could be a positive part of every person's life, and that everyone has the right to pleasure and his/her/hir own erotic desires and sex/gender identity, as long as it's consensually expressed."

On two evenings, the pairings were interesting and dynamic, but on one they fell flat, as if the waiter was on autopilot or didn't know the list very well.

(I don't know how these actors can play these roles eight times a week, they are so demanding.)
Natural gas seeps baffled early civilizations, and likely inspired the Ancient Greeks to build the shrine known as the Oracle of Delphi.

It wasn't until 1993 that the last of the federal price controls were lifted.

"We have an offense this year that allows us to use both the run game and the pass game to set each other up," Fleming said. "There are a lot of options for the quarterback and the running back  or whomever  to run the ball.

Still, he notes that last year's report indicated that U.S. entrepreneurship in 2010 reached its highest level in more than a decade. He reasons that this happened because many people saw new businesses opportunities resulting from the recession. For example, he says reduced commercial property rates may have prompted the launch of new retail shops and restaurants. Many people also likely started businesses in 2010 because they got laid off or their work hours or pay got scaled back. However, the latter types of businesses typically lack full-time employees, he adds.
