Allow the tile to set until the grout resists denting with your fingernail. Use a damp (not wet) sponge to clean the tile. Use an old T-shirt or cotton rag to wipe down any remaining haze.
A recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s is under way, helped by the enormous government stimulus aid. But some question whether the recovery can last once those supports are pulled.

"I call freeways in cities 'failed experiments' that hadn't been tested before the 1950s. But we've now lived with the results in our cities and in our neighborhoods for decades. They have ruined neighborhoods. They have split neighborhoods. To me, it is fundamentally un-American that we would use taxpayer dollars in a way that reduces private property value in cities. My perspective is actually quite conservative. Why in the world would we use taxpayer dollars to harm private property values and burden cities? Cities can't afford the damage, and the nation can't afford pouring more money into ineffective infrastructure. Not only does this kind of spending privilege traffic over people, freeways in cities don't work.

Start a skillet of onions on the stove to caramelize them. Once the onions are beginning to brown, slide the skillet into the oven and cook, stirring every 20 minutes or so, until they are fully caramelized.

Of course, as with anywhere in Hawai'i, there is a much deeper, richer history than might meet the eye. This "Place of Joy" (ko 'olina in Hawaiian), designed in the late '90s to become the "Wailea of Oahu," replaced the sugarcane plantations that James Campbell built on the 'Ewa Plain in the late 19th century.

In an interview in the Washington Post, the Enquirer’s executive editor Barry Levine says the publication did not pay the woman — or anyone for the story.

However the math works out, safe to say the Red Wings would most like home-field advantage in the first round, and most like to find their best game to wear to the party.

Kim Lonsway, director of research for the nonprofit group End Violence Against Women International, worries that low arrest and prosecution rates could discourage future victims from coming forward, leaving them with the impression that reporting a sex crime is pointless and only serves to cause further pain and humiliation.
The company's growth strategy -- expanding in the more lucrative and less-regulated pipeline and gas storage businesses -- is also predicated on volatile prices and increasing demand for natural gas.

"It will be incumbent on the prosecutors to show that the benefit was given for his elected position as commissioner as opposed to his position as party chairman," Mearns said.

Social Security recipients spend, on average, 9 percent of their benefits on Medicare Part B premiums, plus 3 percent on premiums for the Medicare prescription drug program.

Also, when premiums for the prescription drug program increase, as they do almost every year, they can result in a pay cut for Social Security recipients.

Chicken soup with herb-flecked kneidelach (Yiddish for matzo balls), a hallmark of Ashkenazi cooking, is now served by my Yemenite in-laws and appears on so many Israeli Passover tables that some might think it is mandated by the Haggada, the Seder ceremony book. And it's even better when served with zehug, the chile-garlic relish that accompanies Yemenite soups.
Mr. Mitchell is survived by his sons David of Del Mar and Stephen of Winthrop, Wash. and two grandchildren. He was predeceased by a son, Bruce, in 2007 and his wife of 64 years, Harriet, in 2011.

Spalding, for instance, is worried about the amount of discretion it gives local officials - the mayor of St. Louis and St. Louis County executive - to dole out state tax credits. And she pointed to that provision allowing credits - worth one-fifth the cost of construction - for factories even if they don't export. It's a loophole that could cost the state a lot of money, she said.
While Woods was teeing off with every cocktail waitress from here to Tahiti, it now appears, he was playing superb golf. In other words, while doing things that would have horrified his wife, nothing was weighing on his conscience badly enough to affect his athletic prowess.

In a season loaded with head-scratching tallies allowed, Bryzgalov saved the weirdest for the finale. Clarkson's dump-in was pushed by Flyers defenseman Kimmo Timonen toward the goaltender. Instead of controlling it, wrapping it around the boards or even just covering it, Bryzgalov pushed it right back toward a charging Clarkson, whose stick grazed the puck as it slid through the netminder and past the line.

"We wanted to make a strong, strong statement," said new president Kasten.
Jake Scott (Tennessee): To me, Scott makes the most sense. The 30-year-old has proven durable, having started every game for seven straight seasons. He’s also versatile, capable of playing at least three positions on the line. A former member of the Tennessee Titans and Indianapolis Colts, he’s protected for both Peyton Manning and Chris Johnson. He’s not overly big at 6-5, 292 pounds but he has above-average quickness and agility for a guard and would fit in well with the Ravens zone schemes. The Ravens have spoken a couple of times with Scott’s agent, Ken Staninger, and there is certainly mutual interest. But Scott has already been on visits to San Francisco and Miami, and he is believed to be looking for more money than the Ravens currently have available.

That's nonsense. The program, which has been around since 1990 but has expanded significantly in the last few years, certainly needs close monitoring to make sure it is achieving its maximum potential in terms of creating jobs. But the idea that we should give priority in immigration to people who are already successful in their native countries and who have the capital to invest in the development of this nation is absolutely sound.

Richardson: "I injured that in high school. That was in my freshman and sophomore year. I didn't play football until my junior year in high school. My meniscus, that is something that you don't really need. Like I said, that has nothing to do with it. When people talk about a knee injury I say what knee injury. You never see that knee injury (on the field) when it comes down to it."
ODOT Director Jerry Wray released a statement that said Federal Highway Administrator Victor Mendez told him he felt "political pressure to reverse his agency's decision on this."
We'll see if the suit proves a distraction. The Warriors, despite trying to be active in free agency and reportedly trying to pull off trades for Chris Paul and Dwight Howard, have made only minor upgrades, adding Kwame Brown and Brandon Rush.

Vanderbeek also cited previous public statements made by Booker over the years declaring the Devils owner a "lifelong partner" to the city who had created "community center" with the arena.

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- If college football's power brokers had come to their senses 10, five or even two years earlier, Trent Richardson and Brandon Weeden might have shared a football field before putting on Browns uniforms.
Ramirez said the museum, slated to open in 2012, saw a selection of the photos at police headquarters several years ago.

With that phrase popularized by the Black radical Malcolm X, Jackson rebutted those who say Obama's new stand will weaken the massive Black support he needs to win re-election in November. Black voters and especially Black churches have long opposed gay marriage. But the 40-year-old barber and other African-Americans interviewed in politically key states say their support for Obama remains unshaken.

"I believe in free markets and would rather the government just tax carbon rather than get into the politics of which energy sources to subsidize," he said.

So to substitute for that, we like to subsidize renewable energy rather than tax traditional fossil fuels."

Cooney, who hopes to start enrolling sarcoma patients this year for a clinical trial on another new drug, understands Novak's frustration with the process.
Wow. I cannot believe the ineptitude and the gall of our City Council, particularly Len Stone and Mary Ann Nihart. This city is facing one of the biggest challenges it has ever faced with the possibility of losing our Police Department and these two individuals, in one fell swoop, took away our say in the matter by declining the recommendation of the Financing City Services Task Force to place a one half cent sales tax increase on the June ballot. And why? Apparently, because they think they're smarter than the rest of us.

Reed's Spiced Apple Brew is hard to find, but it's worth trying to get ahold of this sparkling apple cider. It has a similar spicy, gingery kick that is so good in Reed's ginger ale and ginger beer.

The federal government has some daunting long-term budget problems, and the November election will give voters a choice between candidates with fundamentally different views over how to respond.

As the Vietnam War stretched from the 1960s into the '70s, came the Americans — perhaps as many as 10,000 draft resisters (a.k.a. draft dodgers, a.k.a. conscientious objectors) by some estimates, along with others eager to start communes in the countryside. Most of the communes fell apart fast, and President Carter pardoned the draft resisters in 1977. But like many Doukhobors and Japanese Canadian families before them, many of these immigrants stayed, raised families and worked as farmers, artisans or entrepreneurs.

To outsource public safety is a travesty no, it is lunacy. The people in our community deserve better. The Pacifica Police Department has provided excellent policing and protection for our law abiding citizens.

Again and again Victorians told me the most delightful trips to Victoria include jaunts out of Victoria --west along the strait to Sooke, perhaps, stopping to wander beaches and deep forest trails.

The most spectacular — the Hudson River, the Rockies and the Cascades, Puget Sound, the Pacific — proved unforgettable.

However, the star of the church that morning was a young woman in a wheelchair. She had perhaps 40 percent of a normal human body: a head, arms, torso, definitely no legs, but the rest difficult to determine. She had blonde hair and the face of an angel. Her name was Vanessa and she could have been 8 or 18 years old. I spoke to her briefly and found she was a freshman in high school. She wore a beautiful beaded necklace. I complimented her on the turquoise colors and she said a friend made it specifically for this outfit. She said her favorite class was geometry, because the teacher treated all her students with affection and humor.

Indeed, so impressed is Wills by what it reveals that it causes him to look deeper into "Nixon Agonistes," as he entitled the 2002 book he wrote about him.

A few well-chosen words here showed that they could outdo a thousand pictures.

(It wasn't clear yet that technical glitches at the New York Stock Exchange bore part of the blame.)

Irvin's pass-rush ability is second-to-none, but he's raw, thin (6-3, 245) and has character issues that include dropping out of high school and spending time in a juvenile jail for burglary. But Carroll had recruited Irvin at USC out of junior college and believed he had a better handle on the wayward kid than most. ‘‘I felt we had special information,'' Carroll said.
"I'm just not sure how any teenage child would feel like they have a right or a place to not comply with a police officer," she said. Such cases "become even more egregious and outrageous because what path is left to those victims? Can I report it, will people believe me, what kind of danger will I put myself in if I tell his colleagues he's been doing this?"
Gov. Rick Snyder in February signed legislation intended to help clarify Michigan's 2006 law banning protests at funerals. Those new bills prohibit conduct, statements or gestures that would make a "reasonable person" attending a funeral or memorial service feel intimidated or threatened.

Bangers and mash, which is popular throughout England and Ireland, typically is made with a mild pork sausage containing lots of breadcrumbs, a bit of sage and gobs of fat. Pile those onto a mound of buttery mashed potatoes topped with greasy gravy and you've got a nutritional nightmare.

If Jamie Allman (or anyone else) wants to hoard incandescent bulbs for the black market in the near future, I'll be there to buy them ("A not-so-bright part of the revolution," Sept. 21). Not so much because of the brightness issues (although that is irritating), but because compact flourescent lightbulbs contain mercury, and the vast majority of people are not going to "dispose of them properly," but instead throw them in the trash.
The resolution expands the observer mission from the 30 monitors approved a week ago. Thus far, however, only seven monitors have arrived in Syria. Two more are expected Monday.

Their goal is mapping and finding new ways to protect plant and animal species in the dry forest. Some programs use satellite imaging to compare tracts of forest and detect changes in soil and vegetation; some involve fieldwork (her team recently traveled deep into the Cerro Hoya, setting cameras to monitor the movement of ocelots and puma); some are educational, such as creating a local network to test new seed varieties and organic-farming methods.
Another suggestion would be that families and/or donors would remember Buck Road Cemetery Association when making their wills for a charitable donation. Or, at times of funerals, through the use of donations at funeral homes, families would inform funeral home directors that donations would be made to Buck Road Cemetery Association as a memorial to honor the memory of the deceased. Again, thank you for considering these memorial suggestions.

Leaving Chen in China could pose risks for President Barack Obama. Washington will be hard-pressed to enforce any guarantees the Chinese leadership might provide on his or his family's safety. Though Chen's mistreatment has largely been seen as the work of vengeful local officials, he slipped away from one house arrest in 2005 only to grabbed in Beijing and sent back.

"If I could sum it up in one sentence: There's more to me than meets the eye. And I think that goes for pretty much everyone, including every person who's overweight. It's not this whole thing where you just eat too much and you have no self-control and you don't exercise. I do exercise. I do try to control my portions.

Though the author's reverence for her subject does shine through, the book suffers at times from a disjointed chronology and writing that can fall flat. We are offered profiles of Herz-Sommer's students, accounts of her brushes with the famous, even recipes from her kitchen.

How dumb really, is the city of St. Louis to expect the state of Missouri to hand over control of the city of St. Louis locally instead of statewide. The city can't even release the information and the documents and the internal investigation pertaining to the (Cardinal game) tickets that were seized and then used and then were put right back again? What kind of a scandal scam is that? How can you possibly trust anything to do with a police department like that or with those employees? I don't know who's over the police department. I'm sure the story has made national news. What a scandal. And why would businesses want to relocate to the city of St. Louis with that going on? It probably scars the entire area.

Writer-director Joss Whedon? He's Miracle Man - the one tasked with making a watchable movie out of "The Avengers." This turns out to be a lot more difficult than it looked. Originally hired only to work on the script, Whedon landed the gig to direct "The Avengers" on the strength of his vision ("The Dirty Dozen," with superheroes) and the skill of his previous film "Serenity," another pop sci-fi adventure with a large cast of complicated characters. "Serenity," which was a spinoff of a failed TV series but was perfectly accessible to newcomers, was rousing and funny and fresh, and it bore all of Whedon's hallmarks, too: Witty dialogue, playful humor, deft ensemble work, surprising turns of plot and exciting, unexpected bursts of action.
Timothy Yi, pastor at the Hayward Korean Baptist church, came in search of information about a member of his flock, Lydia Sim, 21. "We tried to call her and she didn't answer," Yi said. In the distance, officers held up a large white tarp to shield the macabre work of coroner officials.

American pop culture acts as a form of identification that is both minor symbolism and absurdist detail. Three of Boy's friends are named Dynasty, Dallas, and Falcon Crest, for instance, and Alamein arrives telling tales of E.T. which he has seen four times. A quotation from that early '80s megahit acts as epigram to Boy, which shares Spielberg's sense of childhood's autonomy. And like Spielberg, Waititi is willing to make use of a stupid plot point to take his film where he wants it to go. The film takes a dive when Boy, generally quite shrewd, does something unbelievably foolish. At that point some of the fizz goes out of the film.

This week Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D., Del.) and Richard G. Lugar (R., Ind.) introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that calls on the United States to address climate change through international negotiations. Such a resolution would have died in committee last year, when Republicans controlled Congress and senators such as James M. Inhofe (R., Okla.) labeled global warming a hoax. But with the new Democratic majority, this bill may pass - with plenty of Republican support.

West had a hand in the making of nearly every track on "Watch the Throne," and even the two on which he didn’t get a credit sound indebted to his work on last year’s "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" album.
