The Blazers on Thursday waived Roy, using the NBA's newly instituted amnesty clause, which allows teams to wipe a contract off the books. Roy will be paid the remaining $63 million left on his contract, but none of it will count against the Blazers' salary cap.

In addition to requiring voter approval of new taxes and allowing meaningful participation of property owners for new assessments, Prop. 218 addressed the signature requirement for local initiatives dealing with tax matters. Instead of the unrealistically high threshold – a number equal to 15 percent of the voters in the previous gubernatorial election – established to keep citizen sponsored measures off the ballot, for tax measures Prop. 218 adopted the statewide standard, 5 percent of the number of voters participating in the previous gubernatorial election, and applied it to local communities. Although still not easy to qualify a tax-related measure for the ballot, at least now dedicated citizens willing to put in time, have a reasonable expectation of success. Unless, of course, city officials do not understand Prop. 218, or choose to ignore it in the hopes that local signature gatherers will not know the difference.

OK, not just any pizza joint. Players was one of the first upscale pizza places in town, where up until then "gourmet pizza" meant double pepperoni.

Still, that comes with some added responsibility. Though Bryant remains the team's best player, Bynum's effectiveness will largely determine the Lakers' postseason success. That's because it's a given Bryant will play at a prolific rate. With Bynum, it remains unclear. He gives the Lakers a definite inside presence. Bynum also has appeared more aggressive on offense. But he's going to have to become more engaged both defensively and on the glass for the Lakers to truly benefit from his size. For once, Bynum's uncertainty no longer involves health. Instead, it involves his effort.

Tim Collins comes in to pitch with nobody out, the bases loaded and the tying run on first base. The winning run is at the plate, represented by Travis Hafner. If Hafner hits a bomb, the Indians are ahead. Hafner is probably looking for a fastball, so Collins throws him one  at 89 MPH. Hafner swings through it and goes on to fly out. This subtle adding and subtracting of a few miles an hour is another way pitchers keep hitters off balance.

“Teacher effectiveness leads to positive student growth and achievement,” said O’Neil. “Our current evaluation tool, while it is still effective, needs to be re-vamped due to all of the work we as a district have done in the area of curriculum and instruction. As a result, a high quality evaluation system would provide administrators and teachers an opportunity for continued feedback. Prior to the opportunity to apply for this grant, this has been a conversation discussed at the administrative level already. We are looking forward to aligning a tool to reflect all of the hard work that our teachers do in the classroom each and every day. This type of evaluation system also will help our district to identify our teachers’ professional development needs which is imperative to support each teacher’s professional growth. It is a chance for our master teachers to serve as role models for best practices. After all, every teacher is a life-long learner and every student deserves to be taught by an effective teacher.”

None of the contaminated coal ash sites identified by the EPA or environmental groups are located in Missouri.

The group's center is not Skippy but his roommate Ruprecht, a brilliant, overweight, doughnut-gobbling science wonk who talks perpetually about string theory. He is a butt to his derisive companions, yet cherished; and this is another of Murray's many achievements. They find a kind of relief and hopefulness in obsessions that take them away from their own immersion in the usual adolescent concerns with sex, identity, status. Ruprecht enlists them in two disastrous attempts to build an electrical device to transport objects through time via string theory's 11th dimension. Comically far-fetched, it also suggests the teenage need to reach for the impossible.

Results, Day 1: More than two years ago, a large cypress tree fell on a hilly property in the 3100 block of Market Street. There it remained, until it "dried into what amounts to a huge piece of kindling on a hillside covered by flammable, living evergreens," said Ron Ellis, a resident in an apartment building that is connected to the property where the tree fell.

Ellis' concern was relayed to the San Francisco Department of Public Works, and Thursday the DPW's Bureau of Urban Forestry removed the tree's remains, Ellis said. "We (in the area) all feel much safer now that the potential fire hazard has been alleviated," he said.

And instead of kind of stepping back and saying to themselves, well, maybe this didn’t work so well, maybe we should try something different, they decided to double down. Instead of moderating their views even slightly, you now have Republicans in Washington and the ones running for President proposing budgets that shower the wealthiest Americans with even more tax cuts -- folks like me don’t need them, weren’t looking for them. And when you give somebody like me a tax cut, there are only two ways of paying for it: Either it adds to our deficit, meaning it’s not paid for, or you end up -- which is what they’ve proposed -- gutting investments in education and medical research and clean energy and job training programs like this one.

The plan also calls for release of detainees, access for journalists, respect for freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully.

The "Be Turtley Cool - Take Action" theme has been worked into signs that can be posted in business windows and at counters to announce what the business is doing.

The illness has ravaged Nelson’s body, but not his spirit or the way he laughs so hard it looks like he’s crying — attributes which drew Richardson to him nearly two years ago.
Breakfast, complete with silver service in a setting of turquoise elegance, is in a class by itself. From nutmeg-spiked orange juice to crusty bronzed potatoes, everything is done with attention to taste and detail. Meaning nothing is routine: Eggs Benedict take on a Northwest flavor with smoked salmon replacing ham; waffles come with a hint of malt; and a mound of seasonal fruit and cornmeal cakes with wild berry compote exalt the notion of griddle food.

I wanted to write that about Oregon football today. But I looked around while Barkley and his merry band of athletes picked apart a pair of Ducks freshman defensive backs, and dancing off with the prize at the end, and I couldn't help but think about how badly Harris let his team down this season.
North had a difficult rebid to make once South responded to the forcing cue-bid with a spade rebid. North decided that the prime cards in the minors and the semi-solid diamonds compensated for the lack of a third spade, and jumped to game in the suit.

Your friend still might be a friend, just not worthy of BFF status. A BFF should have your back and respect your parents' rules enough to not let you get in trouble. A BFF would try to get you out of trouble, not watch you get in trouble and be relieved it was not her. At the very least, a BFF would sincerely apologize for your punishment if she knew she had caused it.

Creating new sets of formal relationships between Army general-purpose units and the Special Operations Command would be a significant change in Army culture.

TRES BEIN:"Ratatouille" takes place in Paris and was better than I expected. I thought it would be another lame cartoon for young kids, but I found it enjoyable because of all the amusing rat behavior. This flick was original, and not the same "KILL THE RAT!" all the time. It is a good family movie, and you'll enjoy it.
Those jets — "Hawks" — are essential to the game's best feature: its thrilling outer space combat.

In the GOP crosshairs is a board that has yet to be named but would be empowered to force cuts to drug companies, insurers and other service providers if Medicare spending balloons.

The final chapters offer a breezy recapitulation of some of the repressed "revelations" found at Nag Hammadi. The most interesting analysis here suggests why John's "Revelation" thrived while other visions were buried. In short, Pagels argues, the Gnostic writers were simply too lovely, too inclusive, too universal to be politically effective. John of Patmos, though, offered a stark battle between good and evil along with an irresistible list of degrading epithets for anyone to employ against his enemies: "cowards, the faithless, abominable, filthy ... and all liars." How much more useful, Pagels says, to identify true believers with the universally flexible language of God's warriors than by the simple test of the Gospels: "I was a stranger and you welcomed me; I was naked, and you gave me clothing; I was sick and you took care of me; I was in prison and you visited me."

Whew. We haven't even reached Paris, and I'm already tired. So if you choose to stay at the airport when you're connecting, here's what some Facebook respondents told me: "I stayed at the CDG Hilton once. The hotel was fine, but I do NOT recommend the steak in the restaurant." And two others gave the Ibis a thumbs up, although "my room reminded me of a tiny, functional ship's cabin," one said. Look at sources such as Frommers.com and RickSteves.com (in community forums) and, of course, TripAdvisor.com.
The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly of the matter, spoke on condition of anonymity.

Game 2: 8 tonight
There were no pads and no tackles, but Ramirez showed off the sharp over-the-top delivery that helped him break records at Butte (Calif.) College, and Adams displayed a quick-cutting ability that belied his size.

In a recent analysis, published in 2008 in the journal Addiction, Shiffman concluded from four separate studies that starting the nicotine patch two weeks before quitting cigarettes doubles a smoker's chance of success. Some subjects used the patch before quitting, while others did not, and Shiffman's analysis examined whether people were smoke-free six weeks, and then six months, after a target quit date. In three of the studies, patch users were smoking fewer cigarettes even before their planned quit day, though they had not been told to do so.
