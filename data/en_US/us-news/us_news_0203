Sprout and Long made their first visit to Memorial in October 2010. He's one of 51 miniature horses nationwide registered by Pet Partners, a Washington-based nonprofit that trains volunteers and their animals to provide pet therapy in a variety of settings. While dogs are common in pet-therapy programs like Memorial's, the hospital environment is particularly challenging to the temperament of horses. That helps explain why Sprout is the only one of four miniature therapy horses in Colorado working in a hospital, though Long hopes to soon register another, 2-year-old Petey.

With its one-note taste, uniform purple color and nondescript texture, I had to ask to be sure which berries (raspberries, blueberries and blackberries) are in the triple berry pie ($3 a slice). Lacking the distinct flavors of the berries, the taste is that of the ubiquitous berry pie: a little tart, a little sweet, a little bland. But, dull as the filling is, the real problem is the pale crust, which is overworked until it is as dense and tough as an overcooked steak.

Michigan issued $117 million worth of credits in
A jet's forward motion and its engines' mighty air intake draw ice crystals deep inside.

Trank does come up with some clever ways to account for all the footage and angles. Andrew learns to levitate the camera, so it moves all around without the bother of his actually having to hold it.

Other powers, meanwhile, also come and go. The friends can levitate and move objects, but they evidently are also impervious to, for instance, being stabbed with a fork. Yet they are still capable of being wounded later.

When the speech ended, just under half said he was offering “realistic” proposals while about 60% said he would probably not be able to get his proposals accomplished. Both measures were slightly better than before the speech, but reflected voters’ doubts about Obama’s ability to break through Washington’s gridlock. And although the speech moved Obama’s overall job approval upward among the voters studied, the shift was small, from 50% favorable to 58%.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Pinkey Carr's official swearing-in Thursday featured an invocation from her pastor, a soloist's rendition of "Eye on the Sparrow" and an inadvertent Three Stooges comedy act. The ceremonial robing of the judge is often done by someone close to that person. Carr chose her brother, Kerry Carr. But when it came to the zipper, he was all thumbs.

Certificate programs, which can last anywhere from less than one academic year to two years, provide students with an appealing combination of rapid post-secondary achievement and portable skills and knowledge. So critical are these programs that a report from Complete College America — a national nonprofit that works with individual states to increase the number of college degrees — called for a bold effort to double the number of long-term certificates offered within five years and then to double that number again over a subsequent five-year span.

Which position the Bears draft in the first round will be dictated by what they do in free agency. If they are able to acquire a premium pass rusher in free agency, they likely will draft a receiver or a player at another position at No. 19.

The weak jobs report served as a reminder that the recovery is proceeding fitfully. The recession that started in December 2007 ended more than a year ago, in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. But the fallout lingers in the form of a rising unemployment rate. Economists say the economy will have to add up to 300,000 new jobs a month before the unemployment rate drops significantly.

Far too many players blame others for giving the dealer an advantage by splitting 10s. For the average player, or even someone who benefits from the use of perfect basic strategy, seat position or another player's action has little significance on the expected return.
A large debt with faster growth is preferable to a smaller debt sitting atop no growth at all. And it’s infinitely better than a smaller debt on top of a contracting economy.

Lohan's lawyer Brandon Holley asked Revel to look at the totality of the circumstances. Lohan has complied with the bulk of her punishment and missed 7 classes out of a 27-week period because she was believed -- mistakenly, as it turns out -- that she could make them up by taking more than one class in a week, Holley says. "She is absolutely on track to finish this program."
Most bizarre celebrity story of the week: Actor John Stamos testifying in a blackmail trial about a visit to Pleasure Island a few years ago. Suddenly, we had a couple of family icons — Disney and Mr. "Full House" himself — mixed up with accusations of strippers, cocaine and underage women. Next thing you know, we'll hear Ernie and Elmo were caught snorting blow down at Green Meadows petting farm.
In this regard, sports fans and civic leaders should ask themselves what array of sports teams is most befitting of our hard-won stature as an A-list metropolis both nationally and globally? Do we want to remain in the top tier of sports cities? Given this region’s competitive, pro-business spirit, we think the answer is clear. We need the Falcons here.

A young backcourt could be an acceptable reason for the early give-aways.
During one made-for-TV play, Johnson led a Blazers fast break and tossed a laser to Cunningham, who finished with a gliding one-handed dunk.

The Blazers aren't as good as any of the teams in front of them yet. They must achieve dramatic results in a short period of time. While we've watched the organization overcome adversity and deal with a load of injuries the past few seasons, this fine-tuning job is a new challenge, one that the top-tier teams in the NBA struggle to master down the stretch. And so it begins.

"Chris was very private about it over recent days," said state Sen. Joe Kyrillos (R-Monmouth), a longtime friend of the governor.
"The governor is 100 percent committed to" building the memorial, Nichols said. "It is going to happen. No one thinks it is appropriate to relate the Holocaust, which killed 6 million people, to a Disney character."

"Our attendance has only been up in those five years, six years since we've been back," Butterly said. "So, in that situation I think it's created more interest in the college basketball marketplace. And in Las Vegas, we've got UNLV, it's a Mountain West market. The fans have seen our teams all year long."
The pharmaceutical industry that Human Genome operates in sees more brand-name drugs becoming generic offerings in the coming years, and companies are looking for new blockbuster drugs. So analysts expect more large pharmaceutical companies to acquire smaller players — and their drug portfolios — which could mean more merger-and-acquisition activity for Maryland biopharma companies.

The second time would be her last: She called police in the moments before she and three other members of her household were slain Wednesday. Ready, the suspected shooter, killed himself, police said.
I found the length tedious, some of the dialogue eye-rolling and some of the digital effects lacking (the digital ship's digital wake seemed puny) when Titanic first came out. But those quibbles fade with time. Raised to 3-D for its return to the big screen, Titanic plays the way its King of the World creator meant it to  as a history and sociology lesson wrapped in a corny, but fun and entertaining, yarn.
Cleveland moved up from the No. 4 spot to No. 3 in the draft to take running back Trent Richardson.
Then-Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who was known for his combative style, was castigated as a leader out of touch with the changing realities of the city. He generated controversy with gaffes about Latinos, blacks and Jews, most famously with a remark about blacks faring poorly under police chokeholds because their physiology was different from that of "normal" people.
Lemon Grove's Veterans of Foreign Wars post is renaming itself in honor of a Navy SEAL killed in action in 2006.
Many things are well known about Ralph Nader, and the film honors them appropriately: his 1963 Corvair crusade against General Motors, which put him on the map by sending detectives after him and getting caught at it; his ardent advocacy of such consumer causes as seat belts, air bags, clean air and pure food. (He once called hot dogs "missiles of death.") "An Unreasonable Man" also contains its share of oddments and revelations. A glimpse of his office through a barely open door suggests the document-choked lair of a certified pack rat. During an exquisitely ill-at-ease appearance on Saturday Night Live, he wore an airbag that was supposed to deploy, but didn't. George McGovern wanted to consider him as a running mate in 1972, but Mr. Nader's influence declined precipitously during the Reagan years, when support from the Democrats waned as well, and that influence didn't begin to rebound until he reinvented himself as an ever more outspoken outsider.
Higley and Deer Valley Unified School districts were chosen for the 2012-13 school year to receive the extra teacher training, curriculum and help from ASU professors to get these pre-K students better prepared for kindergarten.
Agents arrested Krastev in Idaho, but their suspect refused to tell the government his real name, citing what he described as "safety issues."

Ochsner went to McKay High School and Salem Academy before studying secondary education at George Fox College in Newberg. Part of the English component was a creative-writing class, and she says Ed Higgins, the instructor, tricked the students into writing short stories by telling them to pretend to have characters and then put them in a scene. Before they knew it, they were writing a story. She loved it and wanted to study writing after graduating from George Fox but knew she didn't have the skills.

Three years ago, Toms River sued Dover Woods to force the owners to make big improvements to security and safety for residents and the surrounding area. The case settled in August 2010, with the owners promising to install lights, security cameras and a new fence between the Ramada Inn, Assistant Township Attorney Anthony Merlino said. It was far less that the township had wanted.
The appeal said the state-approved plan, called an agreed order, improperly relies on off-site mitigation projects to compensate for the pollution from new development rather that enacting strict standards for the construction sites themselves.

Zip lines survive political fight: The Legislature dropped efforts to tighten restrictions on the burgeoning but largely unregulated zip line attractions around the state, according to HawaiiNewsNow.com. A worker was killed and another injured in September during tests on a zip line course owned by Lava Hotline on the Big Island. Hawaii has no safety regulations for the approximately 15 zip line courses in the islands. Lawmakers supporting tighter controls say they will try again next year to pass stricter controls. USA Today estimates the number of zip line courses throughout the U.S. at 150 to 350. The newspaper said only four states – Florida, West Virginia, Massachusetts and Missouri – regulate the courses.

Much of that evidence has been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against the defendant. Steve Powell is not charged with acts of voyeurism involving Susan Powell because authorities can't prove she didn't know about the filming.
Przybilla said Aldridge was as vocal as he has ever been in his six seasons. But he also added that being a leader is like being 7 feet tall -- it's a gift. Either you have it or you don't. Aldridge's personality always has been more reserved and guarded than outgoing and forceful. And deep down, he is probably more concerned with teammates liking him than respecting him. It's why after our initial interview -- a frank, passionate and detailed account of the team and his feelings -- he requested that some of his harsher quotes not be used because he had to play with his teammates for the rest of the season.

But, sadly . . . the time has come for the Magic to turn out the lights on the spectacular Dwight Howard era. For months, Orlando has dreaded this day, but now it's here. All-Star Weekend was nice way to forget about it for a while – sort of like two divorcing parents having one last Christmas together. Dwight and the Magic put on a happy face for the kids, but it was all for show. Dwight was a great host, smiling widely, saying all the right things, sitting next to Magic owner Rich DeVos during a timeout, even taking the microphone before the game and thanking the All-Star fans for coming to ‘my city, my home.' The Magic and the NBA had that home – the sparkling, spectacular Amway Center -- decorated beautifully. But now it's time to take down the lights and tell the kids Daddy's leaving.

The communities don't seem to appreciate what they have. Let all these places close for a day, or even a few hours, to show the impact it would have on the communities they serve. People would be hurting pretty fast. No more run to the corner for smokes, or 40-ouncers, or milk and bread, or diapers, or even an ice cream. No more dropping into the gas station for the vehicle, having to drive miles to get better prices on gasoline for the car. No more getting that flat fixed near your home, having to ruin the tire and drive miles to get it fixed and at a much higher price to boot! No more stores giving credit because they know you and know you are good for the money even if you don't have it today.
The Nixon simile is imperfect, however. Unlike Palin, who quit her day job two years prior to completion, Nixon logged 14 years in Washington before he ever ran for president, and by the time he was finally elected, he was already fluent in the nuances of foreign policy. And as skilled as he was at wooing the aggrieved members of the Republican base, he won two national races by capturing the swing voters in the center.

David Steele, FanHouse: "All this news about the Saints' bounties, and the Redskins' bounties, and the Titans' bounties, and the players gleefully and smugly acknowledging how long it's been going on and how widespread it's always been … this is good. For every follower of the NFL, fanatic or casual, these revelations are extremely welcome. The hypocrisy can now end, and honesty can see the light of day. The NFL, its coaches, executives and especially its players can now stop the double-talk, the phoniness and the excuse-making. They can all face who and what they really are, and the fans can face them, too-and the fans, in turn, can face who they are. Nary a one of them gives half a damn about the players' health, safety and long-term well-being. In that light, here's hoping those extra $1,500 the players earned some afternoon when they gave that extra-hard body-slam to some vulnerable receiver, will buy them that extra day in the assisted-living facility they'll be needing in about 30 years. If they make it that far."

Wendell Maxey: Man, this a tough one to write about. And any of these other guys who have covered Brandon Roy or come to know him since arriving in Portland will tell you the same. Because this isn't the same Roy we've come to know. The genuine likability and good natured characteristics remain the same, but his flow on the floor is out of synch and for very good reason. You almost have to treat his case like an Earl Barron or Luke Babbitt and drop Roy - huge contract and all - down to an "incomplete" for the season. For as amazing as Roy was in Game 4 against Dallas, it's still a mystery what you will get from him nightly as he finds himself. One thing is for sure: Brandon must adjust his game. That may mean coming off the bench. That may mean stomaching not being "the man". That may mean understanding this whole Brandon Roy situation is going to take some time for all of us to figure out.

Take tax policy, for starters. Ronald Reagan, concerned about runaway deficits, raised taxes seven of the eight years he was in office. George H.W. Bush famously broke his "no new taxes" pledge in 1991 in order to help keep the nation's fiscal house in relative order. George W. Bush broke new ground - Americans have never seen a chief executive launch wars and cut taxes at the same time - and left the nation with a $10 trillion debt.

I’m not mad at Amazon for low-balling me. They made a fair-market offer. I’m mad at the market for being so inefficient. There’s a giant supply of “Mass Effect 3” out there. It was among the most anticipated games of the year and sold a ton of copies. The demand, however, shifted when public perception turned on BioWare and it became cool to give the game, which people admittedly enjoyed until a storytelling decision was made in the last ten minutes, a one-star rating. Less than two months after release, the game has been on sale for as low as $39.99, even though it’s the highest-selling Xbox 360 game currently on the market. It’s a great game and a great deal, just don’t expect to get anything for it once you’re done.

Deeper into the toolbox: systemic reforms due to be implemented in January 2014. The ACA assures that no one will be denied coverage for preexisting conditions. New health benefit exchanges will provide an online marketplace where individuals and small businesses will comparison shop to find high-quality health plans that best suit their needs. Tax credits and subsidies will help make the coverage affordable. As millions more Americans gain coverage, everyone will pay less of the hidden tax that finances uncompensated care. Over time, the exchange will also support innovations in health care that improve outcomes and reduce costs.
It’s also good news for libraries in neighboring counties, which hope to benefit from Multnomah County’s experience.

The bar's entrance doubles as a free-throw area, with memorabilia in cages on either side.

A tennis net separates the main dining area from a sunken level with a few of the sports that I partake in: pool, foosball, air hockey. Even the seating is themed in certain areas, with stadium-style folding seats protected by a guardrail, completing the scene but for a strolling peanut vendor.

* Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo has only one assist to his name through the first four games, but that hardly tells the story of his play. Pietrangelo has been pressured, non-stop, by the big San Jose forecheckers. But Pietrangelo has rarely been rattled, and continues to do a smooth job of helping the Blues transition from defense to offense. He's also logged the second-highest amount of minutes on the Blues' penalty kill, which has allowed only two goals in 15 shorthanded situations. All in all, only 11 NHL players are averaging more time on ice per game than Pietrangelo this postseason.

The people who constructed this part of the city to house a booming population after the 1906 quake were in too much of a hurry to do it right or well. Their foundations are on concrete, but the concrete is on sand, and the sand is on water and water won't hold. Above the foundation the houses were built for speed and appearance, with basements made of unreinforced studs and unanchored sills -- like too-heavy tables on spindly legs. When the automobile came along, owners tore open those basements to make garages with big rolling doors. By doing so, they ripped out one leg of their tables -- the earthquake took the rest.

If the Browns don't go for Griffin, they'll surely take a hard look at Tannehill later in the first round. But Tannehill's stock is rising and he probably won't be around at No. 22. Scouts won't see him work out at the combine because he's recovering from surgery to repair a broken foot.

Scott Crichton might have made more news off the field for some choice comments this spring, but he was also good in OSU's 15 practices. Riley said defensive ends Rusty Fernando and Rudy Fifita "improved a lot," and also mentioned Devon Kell, which means that plus Crichton and Dylan Wynn the Beavers "might have five ends who can play in a game." Riley also noted that Andrew Seumalo is probably the Beavers' "best player up front right now," and the thinking within the media circles is that Andrew will be extra motivated this offseason, because he doesn't want little brother showing him up anytime soon. While Riley was quick to rave about improvement from almost all his guys, it's no secret that OSU must continue to develop defensive depth at every position if they want things to be different this fall.

An All-American and ACC Defensive Player of the Year his junior season at Boston College, Herzlich was a surefire NFL prospect. He decided to return for his senior year, but missed the entire season when he was diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma. He miraculously returned to play in 2010, but wasn’t the same player and went undrafted. The Giants signed him and, against all odds again, Herzlich made the team.

So why choose to work with a couple of -- dramatic percussive sound effect -- unknowns? Four weeks' immunity! Plenty of teams decided the four weeks' immunity was well worth gambling on a pair of silhouettes, and went for it. But since both the Portland teams didn't finish high enough to have a choice, both wound up with Bob and Jillian.

"This isn't a multigenerational culture. We're obsessed with youth, which is ridiculous. There should be an ongoing recognition of the past and a dialogue with people who are older, because they're smarter and more seasoned.
Nurses who are knowledgeable and upbeat can help relax and encourage a patient and family members when the patient is advised of the need for admission to a hospital unit.

Shouldn't we be talking about that in church? Or does that feel too personal, somehow, too invasive? Food is such a basic necessity, and yet in our culture it's an incredibly complex topic. Beyond nutrition, food is how people show love; it is a quick, cheap, and socially-acceptable way to comfort and indulge oneself. You can't even begin to discuss it publicly unless you're willing to open up a pretty big can of worms and deal with the emotions that such a discussion will surely engender.

From 1973 through 1985, as Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, documented in 2009, American banks never earned more than 16 percent of domestic corporate profits. By the mid-2000s, that figure rose to 41 percent. As with profits, so with pay: For more than three decades, from 1948 to 1982, pay levels in finance ranged from 99 percent to 108 percent of the average of private-sector pay. By 2007 they had reached 181 percent.
Although blanc de noirs are considered dry, they are not bone dry and can be fruity. They also have substantial body. I decided to try two in the under-$15 range, and I made sure they were made in a similar fashion to Champagne using a process known as the méthode champenoise. Those wines go through a second fermentation in their own bottles, which can produce better-tasting wines with longer-lasting, small bubbles.

Once I heard John Harbaugh used the words “asterisk,” “stained” and “New England” in the same sentence during a radio interview with 98 Rock yesterday morning, I knew what the reaction was going to be. Any NFL player or coach that says something even semi-interesting about Spygate or the New Orleans Saints’ bounty situation becomes a headline. Anybody who is perceived to challenge the success of Patriots coach Bill Belichick is going to be greatly scrutinized. I get it, as my old friend Buck Showalter likes to say. But did Harbaugh honestly say something that was especially revealing or untrue? Did he mount a personal attack on Belichick? No, what he did do was capture the reality of the post-Spygate world for the Patriots. Whether they like or not, there are going to be some people in the NFL – and plenty of fans – who believe that their three Super Bowls are in some way tainted. After listening to Harbaugh praise Belichick at every opportunity over the years and knowing that they have a solid relationship, I don’t believe the Ravens coach to be one of those people. I also don’t blame him for acknowledging the obvious, that Spygate – whether New Englanders like it or not, whether it is fair or not – is going to be part of the legacy of those Super Bowl-winning Patriots’ teams. It may turn out to be a very small part, but when all is said and done and Belichick calls it quits on his Hall of Fame career, his role in that scandal will undoubtedly be included in stories in his career postscript. As for Harbaugh, he probably could have chosen his words a little more carefully, but let’s be honest here: those remarks were rather benign.

Ephron shuttles back and forth between these two, usually adroitly, and sometimes in the same essay. There she is, in marathon labor — OK, most women have been there, done that — but she's in a hospital in L.A., and who strolls in to visit the screaming young woman in the bed opposite Ephron but Elizabeth Taylor, mother-in-law of the screamer. La Taylor is carrying a tiny white dog, and her assistant is carrying a primitive cellphone "almost as large as the dog."
An impressive new study just underlined this in neon pink. It followed 19,000 Harvard students for decades.

MESSING: Probably not, because (this statute) likely applies only to smuggling offenses and concealing aliens in the process of being smuggled from law enforcement. Transportation of an undocumented relative to church is likely outside the scope of the kind of transportation contemplated by the statute, but the point will have to be settled finally by the appellate courts. Federal courts, in interpreting similar federal statutes from which the language of the Arizona statute was derived, generally have not applied the laws to transportation of aliens in a non-smuggling social context, but the federal appellate themselves are not in total agreement on this point.

What’s this album about?: An early review of “Have One On Me” called it a three-disc love letter to Newsom’s boyfriend. Synthesizing an album as long-winded as this after a pass or two can’t be easy, but I’ll bet that writer would like a do-over. There are, maybe, four stanzas of unmitigated joy on this three-disc set; the rest is trouble, and not always of the romantic sort. Yes, she kicks off the marathon by telling her beau that she’s easy to keep, but the caveats come fast: everything is fine as long as she’s willing to be subsumed by the concerns of the relationship. Which, given her ambition, isn’t long. By the second verse, she’s “dulling and dumbing in the service of the heart alone”; by the end of the song, she’s comparing herself to Bloody Mary. “I fell for you, honey, easy as falling asleep,” she sings on “Good Intentions Paving Company.” This from a narrator who takes pains elsewhere on the collection to make it clear she’s got debilitating insomnia. When Newsom does sleep, she dreams, and the visions aren’t pretty. On “Go Long,” she’s presented to her lover in a rickshaw made of the broken bodies of his old girlfriends. In another, as the crowd cheers, a tarantula mounts a countess's brassiere. The whole shebang climaxes with a nightmare: in “Kingfisher,” the penultimate track on HOOM3, Newsom’s boyfriend stabs her in the chest, and blood rushes out of her body in an infinite torrent, “spreading in a circle like an atom bomb.” This is a Shakespearean tragedy of an album, and by that I don't mean the poetry is excellent, even though it is. Nevada City’s most famous export is a nature girl, and nature is red in tooth and claw. “Have One On Me,” a menagerie in the truest sense, contains: a frog, a daddy longlegs, that tarantula, dead flies, a trout, several horses, one stolen, one a black mare, a skinned bunny (more on her in a bit), a bark-beetle, three bears (two black), a fox that eats the singer’s goldfish, jackrabbits with broken necks, two dancing monkeys, the business end of a bee, crickets, a bulldog, a waxwing, a mutt from the municipal pound, a pup in the barley, a serpent, a lion. Then there’s the crowded aviary -- two geese, a crane, hawks, vultures, starlings, magpies, blue jays, mourning doves, a keening loon (by a leaning moon), the kingfisher. Newsom’s (not the narrator’s) boyfriend is reliably likened to a spider: predatory, web-spinning, poised to devour. As for the artist herself, she’s twisting and writhing against him, “like something caught on a barbed-wire fence”. Most of HOOM takes place in forest glades, gardens, and country houses. When Newsom sings on “In California” that her heart is heavy as an oil-drum, the sudden appearance of heavy industry makes the simile feel as alarming as a fist banging on a metal plate. Human characters are imagined as wild animals, most caught in a struggle to persevere and survive; God, here, is distant, and natural law is manifest and presiding. And what is lawless, godawful, against nature? Love, the singer wails, on “Soft As Chalk.” Love comes to the forest and interrupts, it subverts, it sends unwanted ripples through the pond. “Have One On Me” isn’t the first album to blame sociobiology for the breakdown of a relationship; what’s different here is that Newsom herself doesn’t seem to be complaining. Rueful and heartbroken she is, but she’s also resigned to the ferocious order of the jungle; an order that is upset by the romantic affectations of a boyfriend who is, in any case, unable to transcend his own animal nature. She’s something that sprung up in the dirt, “rich as roe,” of Nevada City; she’ll be in her hometown for good, she reminds us on “Autumn,” and the California state line is the border of her heart. There are also strong intimations that something has gone terribly wrong inside of the garden, and that the narrator’s own biology isn‘t behaving: a pregnancy averted, or terminated, or ended in miscarriage; notes of infanticide, sacrifice, child abandonment, negligence in the deep woods. “Esme” strains to be cheerful about somebody else’s baby but doesn’t quite get there; “On A Good Day” hints at a missed opportunity. Then there’s the gut-punching “Baby Birch,” which, in the noncommittal-but-not-really spirit of “Bear” by the Antlers, comes just shy of suggesting that an abortion has really screwed the protagonist up. “I hated to close the door on you,” Newsom sings of the title character, and it quickly becomes apparent that she’s writing about a child, not a boyfriend. With some distaste, she watches goslings fumbling along aside their mother. The music changes (the music on HOOM is full of changes), and into the song barge the sinister cast of a nursery rhyme: a blacksmith, a shepherd, a barber, a butcher-boy. But it’s the main character who grabs the bunny and, as it kicks and mewls, puts it to the knife. “I thought it would be harder to do, but I caught her and skinned her quick,” she concedes. Like so much of this blood-spattered set, the horror here -- both natural and un-natural -- is vivid; even worse, some of the violence is this graceful, elfin, and menacingly-intellectual writer’s own doing. The rest is the fault of nature, that indifferent matron.

When Asian carp numbers increased on the Illinois River a few years ago, people boating and fishing those waterways were amazed. They couldn't believe fish of that size were jumping like hooked tarpon in the Florida Keys. Dangerously heavy fish in the 40- to 50-pound range that vaulted into the air could stun a fisherman speeding down the river or a jet skier on a zigzag course along the riverbank.

It all starts with Coples, a 6-foot-5, 285-pound defensive lineman from North Carolina who has a knack for the sack and creating commotions up front. Although many fans at the draft's site at Radio City Music Hall were chanting for the Jets to take South Carolina's Melvin Ingram at No. 16 overall, Coples might be better suited for what Ryan wants to do. And that, of course, is to be the league's No. 1 defense.

I started to pursue music seriously when I was about 13 years old. It is hard to say what originally drew me to music; making music just felt right to me.
