The Christians were nudged out in the 8th century, when Damascus became the capital of the early Islamic world, and the current structure was built. The mosque complex, including a courtyard and prayer hall, is vast -- 200 yards long by 100 yards wide -- and enclosed by enormous walls that still hold some of the Roman temple's original stonework. The three corner minarets and the Dome of the Eagle, which stands on four pillars inside the south wall, are visible for miles.

Two weeks before the House vote, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its estimate of Obama's budget, including its health care program. From 2011 to 2020, the cumulative deficit is almost $10 trillion. Adding 2009 and 2010, the total rises to $12.7 trillion. In 2020, the projected annual deficit is $1.25 trillion, equal to 5.6 percent of the economy (gross domestic product). That assumes economic recovery, with unemployment at 5 percent. Spending is almost 30 percent higher than taxes. Total debt held by the public rises from 40 percent of GDP in 2008 to 90 percent in 2020, close to its post-World War II peak.

We see an America where every citizen has the skills and training to compete with any worker in the world. That's why we've set a goal to once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. That's why we're revitalizing our community colleges, and reforming our education system based on what works for our children – not what perpetuates the status quo.

The so-called Group of Seven economies -- the U.S., Canada, Japan, the U.K., France, Italy and Germany -- are all facing a similar challenge.

It was eye-opening to discover that a list of specialty drinks included a souped-up margarita, the Big Papi, for $19.

This was very much a cottage industry up until the 1990s. Then systems became more affordable, and people became more security-conscious. All of the electronics have become more affordable recently.

Indeed, the primary reason that the terms of the 1983 compromise no longer work is demographic - the population is aging, and people are living longer. As a result, they will draw far more money out of the program than did previous generations.
So Obama is flirting with a future budget crisis. Moody's emphasizes two warning signs: rising debt and loss of confidence that government will deal with it. Obama fulfills both. The parallels with the recent financial crisis are striking. Bankers and rating agencies engaged in wishful thinking to rationalize self-interest. Obama does the same. No one can tell when or whether a crisis will come. There is no magic tipping point. But Obama is raising the chances.

Heavy rain showers will spread across Texas on Thursday, as a low pressure system moves through the Southern Plains. The system will strengthen as it obtains moisture and energy in from the Gulf of Mexico. This will allow for heavy rains and severe thunderstorms to develop across most of Texas throughout the day. Flash flooding is likely across parts of central and southern Texas, as rainfall totals may exceed 3 inches. There is a slight chance of severe weather development for the region with threats of large hail, strong and damaging winds, as well as a few tornadoes.

Which brings us to the question of what it will take to end this depression we're in. Many pundits assert that the U.S. economy has big structural problems that will prevent any quick recovery.

But convincing utilities to fully embrace energy efficiency has vexed legislators, regulators and policy advocates for years. For a century, Ameren and its predecessor, Union Electric Co., has made money building infrastructure - power plants and a local power grid - to sell electricity to customers.

A: When you have these new platforms ... it's different. The Windows battleship is cruising along. Then, in the distance, suddenly appears -- whatever, other people's mobile phone platforms, and they may be heavy cruisers and they're closing the gap with you. So what do you do? Do you make Windows better? Do you build a couple of cruisers of your own? And they're doing some different things. So it's kind of like that.

You ignore these new platforms at your peril. Microsoft isn't ignoring them. They're behind and they're trying to catch up, to be very frank.

It was the 14th of Manning's 45 fourth-quarter or overtime game-winning drives, but it was different, as all have been since. It was a vivid, up-close reminder that the game we watch and the game they play, that he plays, with its sweat and strain and hits and hurts, are worlds apart.
Another issue, Amendola's request for early disclosure of grand jury transcripts, received little attention in the courtroom, and afterward Sandusky defense lawyer Karl Rominger said it may end up being resolved by the judge who supervised the jury.

The Browns are loaded at tight end, which is not necessarily a good thing from a fantasy perspective. Veteran Ben Watson hovered around fantasy respectability last season while posting the best stats of his seven-year career.

"We are not factoring that into our budgetary plans. We are counting on a significant return on the debt portion but on the equity portion we're assuming up front, we will be assuming that that's a 100 percent cost.

That one, it appeared, might have constitutional issues, harking back to a 1994 law that said officers could not leave their community to get to a highway to write tickets.

It is easy to spend a full day, or more, exploring Chichén Itzá, but three or four hours is sufficient to enjoy the highlights. First and foremost is the Pyramid of Kukulcán, the Mayan feathered serpent god. Also known as El Castillo, the pyramid has four sides that each have 91 steps. Total them up, add the platform on top as the final step and one gets, not coincidentally, the number of days in a year. Says Marin: "The Mayans had the best calendar until NASA." Indeed, they calculated exactly every solar and lunar eclipse from 3,000 B.C. until well into the future, to Dec. 21, 2012, when their calendar ends and many predict the world will, too.

The first, a conservative approach, saw the country’s confusion as largely an urban problem, in which the middle class had been victimized by radicals and common criminals, long coddled by a mushy legal system.

We remain thankful for her effort to support at-risk youth in the community.

2006 JC Cellars California Cuvee Syrah ($25) A utility infielder, this full-bodied Syrah from winemaker Jeff Cohn has the dark fruit and body to take on grilled meats and most tomato-based sauces, as long as the sauce's chile heat doesn't burn down the barn. Cohn - who began his wine career with Kent Rosenblum at Rosenblum Cellars - left in 2006 to focus on his Oakland winery. This is blended from multiple vineyards and appellations, resulting in a deep, rich California-style Syrah. Ripe aromas and flavors of blackberry, loam and pepper with generous lashings of oak. Includes 21 percent Petite Sirah.

Martz got the matchup he wanted on the Bears' third offensive play against Seattle. Greg Olsen streaked past ancient Seahawks safety Lawyer Milloy, collected a perfect pass from Jay Cutler and scored on a 58-yard catch and run.

Under the plea deal described in the media reports, Urdangarin would agree to plead guilty on condition prosecutors not seek a jail term of more than two years. The length of any sentence is key because first-time offenders in Spain — Urdangarin has no criminal record — who are convicted of a crime and sentenced to two years or less automatically receive a suspended sentence. So Urdangarin would not go to jail.

On our last full day, the waves are coming hard and fast. My adrenaline is pumping. At home, I would never have tried anything this big. I am in the lineup, and the swells are head-high. I am both very scared and excited. A few women get good rides, and this boosts my confidence. Cailin wisely recommends waiting out some larger waves and riding some whitewater. This is fine by me, because the waves are huge, and I came here to learn and have fun.

On behalf of all shoppers, I was outraged. I often give or receive gift cards for special occasions and know they’re not all used right away. Cards can be tucked away in wallets and half-forgotten. Maybe a card is from a store not often visited. Maybe it is given to someone who is saving for a big purchase or waiting for a sale or just prefers to hold it for a rainy day. Cards can be partially used and the remaining money saved for the next shopping trip.

The council appears unlikely to approve the moratorium. City officials have concluded that it would be legal only if it could be shown that such construction would have an "adverse impact upon . . . public health or safety."

I fully agree that we must be ever vigilant of perpetrating and perpetuating racial and religious slurs in our speaking and writing.

Mike Acker: Chris Johnson is a tough call for me. Like all Blazer fans, I was impressed by the way he carried himself in the playoffs.

If he can be included in a deal that brings in a contributing player I think you have to go for it. Otherwise, get him in the gym, get some meat on his bones, and make him part of the rotation.

There is nothing wrong with MMPI rethinking its business model. Companies do that all the time; they have no choice in today's precarious economy. Enhancing Cleveland's ability to attract medical conferences and related trade shows, most of which have a strong educational component, was always a critical component of the project. So in the long run, this may not be that radical a departure.

Blood flow: A 2011 study found that brisk walking a few times a week improved blood flow by as much as 15%. The research, presented at the April Experimental Biology meeting in Washington, D.C., assessed 16 women who were 60 and older. The women engaged in an exercise program tailored to their fitness levels over a period of three months, starting light — exercising for 30 minutes three times a week at about half of their maximum oxygen uptake — then gradually increasing the intensity and time of their workouts. Blood flow to the brain increased an average of 15% in the women's left internal carotid artery and 11% in their right internal carotid artery (the arteries are in the neck and supply the brain with blood). The women's blood pressure and heart rates decreased slightly.
