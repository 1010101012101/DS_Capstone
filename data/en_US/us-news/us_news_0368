5. Senio Kelemete, Washington, 6-3, 307: A former defensive tackle who also has played left tackle, Kelemete is simply a football player. His body type suggests his best position will be guard.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. – Bill Cowher can see himself coaching once again. He just doesn’t know where. And he doesn’t know when.
Spring training crowds - especially the seniors - are notoriously friendly. Wear a team cap, a T-shirt, or some other sign of geographic identity - they're sure conversation-openers.

The school board acquired the house built by Christopher Vought when it bought the 65-acre former Wilda Johnson farm, which straddles Grayrock Road, for $3.4 million in 2004. During the American Revolution, it was a hot-bed of loyalist activity and a target of raids by insurgent neighbors.

Speaking of gross: A report says shoving bacon up your nose can stop a nosebleed.

Brown's proposal is more reasonable than the proposition by some members of Congress to strip EPA of authority to regulate these gases.

It doesn't help that domestic Canadian lobbying groups are actively working against their own economic interests, claiming oil sand products inherently damage aboriginals and perform unspeakable acts on Mother Nature. Over the past week, I've seen two documentaries on the Kremlin-funded Russian international television network making similar claims about North American natural resource industrialism -- all while Russia opens up its new Nord Stream natural gas line running right under the Baltic Sea from Russia directly into Germany, where it can provide an environmentally friendlier alternative to crude while not ceding an inch of crude-oil imperialism.

“How was Flacco supposed to respond when asked that question?” wrote Hensley, who covers the AFC North. “I guess he could have given a more toned-down answer -- that he doesn't compare himself to other quarterbacks, for example, or doesn't place labels on himself. If he'd said that he was the 15th-best quarterback in the NFL, people would be ripping him for having no faith in himself.”
The Marine Corps said the jet suffered a mechanical failure, but a series of bad decisions led the pilot — a student — to bypass a potentially safe landing at a coastal Navy base after his engine failed.

Taylor Kitsch: Friday Night Lights" fans know him as Tim Riggins, the sexy, tormented football star who dropped out of college but deserves an honorary PhD in brooding. Now Kitsch is making the leap to action star with "John Carter." The Disney epic about a Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars opens Friday. Then it's on to "Battleship" on May 18, a film inspired by the board game that should be a better vehicle for Kitsch's quiet strength than, oh, say, Hungry, Hungry Hippos. He's also starring in "Savages," an Oliver Stone crime drama out July 6. Clear eyes, full heart, Kitsch's magnetism can't lose?

South Pasadena (picture Mayberry with yoga) may inspire daydreams about moving in. But first, get breakfast at Heirloom Bakery (807 Meridian Ave.). Stroll on highly walkable Mission Street, Meridian Avenue and El Centro Street, and maybe break for a snack at Buster's Ice Cream & Coffee Stop (1006 Mission St.). If it's Thursday afternoon, catch the farmers market on Meridian between Mission and El Centro. Then retire to your room. Where? Perhaps the Arroyo Vista Inn (335 Monterey Road), a genteel hillside bed and breakfast at the top of a long driveway. It has nine well-appointed bedrooms in a 1910 Craftsman. But there's no pool, and it's not a good choice for children. If you have kids, look at the Bissell House (201 Orange Grove Ave.), a lived-in Victorian on the Pasadena/South Pasadena border with a pool in back. From there, it's a half-mile to to dinner at the Raymond Restaurant (1250 S. Fair Oaks Ave., Pasadena).

Photographing birds makes me go slower and spend more time enjoying them and watching their behavior. My identification skills for birds in the western half of the continent were such that I could identify them by sight or sound within a few seconds and I often went on to immediately look for different species -- I wasn't spending time enjoying the birds, only building up big day lists or searching for rarities.
Ancient wise men stand vigil in the dark forest meditating on the folly of man as they slowly drink the rain. Men with voices of thunder slaughter the pines hacking them into houses and couches for potato people. The air reeks of blood sap, sticky on the workers' hands.

"Juan's going to be streaky," Mattingly said of Uribe. "I'm not going to let two games determine how we use this guy. Juan's going to get his at-bats. He's going to get his chances. I don't really have anyone that I can play every day over there. I think he's our best defensive guy over there."

Snyder's radical shift in economic development tactics was driven in part by the need to shore up Michigan's finances by wiping future tax credits off the books. Now other states may start looking at the Michigan model because they, too, face looming fiscal deficits, or -- like Georgia -- they see diminishing returns as competing states also spend big bucks to attract a limited number of jobs.

What the Salgado situation reminds me of is a highly recruited college basketball player. A situation where teams go to great lengths to land the player. Sometimes, the effort is worth it and the player transforms into a star. Sometimes, the player can't live up to expectations and ends up a bust.
More an art campus than a museum, MAXXI is already a hub for events such as this summer's Young Architects Program, which has transformed the piazza into an archipelago of green islets.

Factor in pole vaulter Melissa Gergel, who battled tricky wind conditions to clear a meet-record 14 feet 1 1/4 inches and took a pair of unsuccessful stabs at 14-8 1/4 -- that would have been a school record -- and Zoe Buckman, who shaved three seconds off her personal record in the 1,500 with a time of 4 minutes 12.80 seconds, and this is shaping up as one formidable team.

Even so, Missouri schools are dealing with cuts to full-day kindergarten, art, music, Parents as Teachers and summer school, all programs that Missouri had previously spent years building up, Nicastro said. In her 34 years as an educator, never has a budget situation been this dire, she said.
Bäco Mercat is a lot quieter than Chang's New York restaurants, though. Ceilings are dramatically high, and bare filament bulb fixtures dangle low, the better to illuminate the food. Despite the music playing and the animated chatter, you can still hear yourself talk, maybe because the bar is at the front, near the door. Stop in for a Bäzerac made with rye, lemon verbena, pernod, bitters and a twist of lemon, among the handful of house cocktails at $11.

A: If once a year or less your brain replays a surveillance tape, like Denzel Washington's character in "Deja Vu," you're not traveling on a supernatural information highway. It's perfectly normal: Almost three-quarters of us report we've had an eerie feeling we're experiencing something AGAIN, when we know that's just not possible. Ironically, such flashes may even signal that you've got a good memory.

"My only challenge," acknowledges Ann Patchett in her charming introduction to "Binocular Vision," describing the experience of reading one of Pearlman's stories in public, "was to keep from interrupting myself as I read. So often I wanted to stop and say to the audience, 'Did you hear that? Do you understand how good this is?'" Patchett is not alone. As I made my way through "Binocular Vision," I kept stopping to read passages aloud to my wife, my friends, anyone who would listen. "Did you hear that?" I would ask them.

Added Wade: “It’s very unfortunate, one of the great players in our game. You never want to see anyone go through an injury. Obviously, we’re sure he will bounce back. One thing about this league, we have some of the best doctors and trainers. It’s very unfortunate for him and his family. I’m sure Orlando will miss him and the Olympic team is going to miss him. But the biggest thing is that he gets healthy and he’ll get back to be an amazing player he is for this game.”
Republicans have been stung in the past over social issues, and many activists believe such matters are most useful for energizing the conservatives at the core of the party. The economy, on the other hand, is the top issue on voters' minds, according to polls.
One is the agreement that gives the drug review and drug safety offices within the FDA equal responsibility for "significant safety issues" pertaining to medicines that are under review or have already been approved for marketing. The drug safety group is so narrowly focused on "safety" that it seems oblivious to the fact that because all drugs have side effects, safety cannot be evaluated in a vacuum. Instead, "safety" must be part of a risk-benefit judgment. The group's motto might be: "If you don't approve new drugs, you avoid safety problems with them." These drug safety zealots should be returned to a purely advisory role.

A: Your suspicions are understandable. Why would one employee waive you off, while another one goes over the car with a fine-tooth comb?

The jump occurred during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and here are the stunning numbers: He broke the world record by nearly 2 feet, and Beamon never reached 27 feet again.

But serious people on both ends of the political spectrum are speculating that 2012 could be the Republican Party's last hurrah -- not just a down year in which it fails to knock off the incumbent president (as the opposition party has failed to unseat three of the last four presidents who sought re-election), but the last election in which a Republican candidate contends seriously for the White House.

Christopher Goffard's article was an especially fine piece of writing. It was well-structured and lucid, with many beautiful turns of phrase.

Cristalino: Though it's close to the hugely popular Cenote Azul, not many tourists find their way to this local favorite, which has a great jump-off point and a cave to explore. It overflows on Sundays with people beating the heat on their only day off, but the rest of the week you might have it to yourself.

It's also a mouthful. Could we abbreviate to the Cos-Clay-Vets maybe? Or CCV? That would borrow a page from the Saudi Arabians, who dubbed the King Fahd Causeway, a series of bridges, for the shortened name of its then-ruler.

The school office is over here, and that's where we check in.'"

Una Keenon, president of the school board, said the resolution wasn't meant "to hurt anyone's feelings," ignoring the fact that it did -- and that she had already received several applications for library board positions.

Since 1918, only four Cardinals pitchers have opened the year with a four-start streak of at least five innings and no more than one earned run. Dizzy Dean did it in 1937. Mort Cooper did in 1943.

The Cardinals' pitching is off to its stingiest start since 1981, and it's happened without a win from Adam Wainwright or a pitch from Chris Carpenter, the club's co-aces.
Wiggins, who cracked the Sentinel's 2011 Central Florida Super60 this week, for which the three-game update will be released Friday online, isn't the only undersized player from Central Florida looking for big-time offers. The 5-foot-10, 170-pound Trenier Orr of Ocoee and Ricky Harper of Orlando Oak Ridge are still anticipating more contacts. Bethune-Cookman and South Carolina coaches were at an Oak Ridge practice last week. Orr already has Colorado State, Illinois and Eastern Michigan offers.

Chad Mayer, an assistant manager of Massage Envy on Lindbergh, was tracking the storm online, but had no warning when the tornado struck, he said.
Most of the bullying I encountered as a child was just verbal abuse. Did I say "just"? Verbal is bad enough. I wasn't a constant target the way some kids were, but I got my share of ridicule. The "freaks" who called me "Virgin Mary" in high school bothered me less than the popular girls who made fun of my clothes, my hair, my face....I have this secret wish that at high school reunions those who picked on others in school would explain why they did what they did. You know, it was all a long time ago, I have no hard feelings at this point. Just help me understand what drives that kind of behavior. Why, day after day, would you choose to be cruel?
Even Thursday's action against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. by the nation's chief banking regulator, the Federal Reserve, doesn't address potential paperwork problems before 2009.

But at least Ryan has a record. Even if you don’t project him to be the next Don Shula he did lead the Jets to successive AFC Championship Game trips his first two years on the job, and has a well-earned rep as a smart defensive mind.

Robb also added that the Coast Guard has also requested assistance from good Samaritans in the area, but so far had not received any responses.
Weinsoff says one of the town's biggest challenges is protecting its diversity. Mostly because of its location (on a clear day you can see San Francisco), the median price of a home is $750,000 and the cost of living is high. The town, population 7,500, doesn't want the economy to squeeze out the firefighters, police, blue collar and service workers, artists and activists who live here.

Because it was a musical about a band, I wanted to resist a more conventional approach to musical theater, he said. And they (Brickman and Elice) were not resistant to this at all. I think the reason we have such a success has everything to do with the brilliant book that they wrote. And that's their book. They did the writing. I did not do the writing on this project.

A number of representatives overlook the symbolic importance of the barrier to naturalized citizens, focusing on the fact that we already have a talented pool of people from which to choose a president. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) got the bipartisan spirit of our endeavor, saying he'd favor a constitutional amendment to allow naturalized citizens to run for president, "even those I may not support myself." We hope mere partisanship isn't driving the views of others.

I wish to thank residents in advance for their patience as we undertake the task of making our park, including Sunset Lake and the Raceway, the very best that it can be. I am confident that the end of this matter will see us with a lake-raceway system much less vulnerable to the ravages of Mother Nature than it was prior to August 2011.

Provide six innings as often as possible and limit the opposing lineup to as few crooked numbers as possible. Sounds simple right? From that spot in the rotation the Cardinals need stability and innings as much as anything. A league average ERA would be a huge bonus. Think more along the lines of quality starts.
