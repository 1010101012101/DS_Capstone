And that's the picture emerging over the past five years. A Post-Dispatch analysis of test scores shows schools in the metro area have generally made slow-and-steady progress in math and communication arts, raising their overall passing rates to 53 percent of students from 44 percent in 2006. That's just a smidgen lower than state averages.
Mobility can be a blessing and a curse. Laptops and cell phones make workers available at all times, blurring the lines between the workday and personal time. Companies give up some control over the work environment, and a home office or coffee shop can be fraught with distractions. But going mobile can mean less travel time, fewer tanks of gas and a better work-life balance for some employees.

It depends on what qualifies as saving it. That's our goal, in essence, but our main focus is the natural world in all its complexity and as its basis of the quality and sustainabililty of life on the planet. What's interesting in Africa is how easy it is to see how closely people are to the natural world and how dependent they are that it functions properly and productively. There are few safety nets, little help from governments, and more often, more powerful forces are able to exploit natural resources, usually unwisely and unsustainably. Wildlife is the first to suffer, closely followed by local people who have few alternatives and find that the resources they have depended on for generations have been destroyed by modern, commercial-scale exploitations that feed foreign markets. Much of this exploitation is illegal and some is done without use of best practices or application of laws and regulations.

The main claim of "Why Nations Fail" is twofold. First, differences in institutions—not geography or culture—are the key explanation for differences in wealth around the globe.

Followers of J.K. Rowling's seven-book magnum opus already know how it ends. Followers of the movies probably have a good idea, too, but knowing what happens in this, the eighth and last film adaptation - the fourth straight directed by David Yates - doesn't lessen the wallop. Who dies? Which characters pop up in an epilogue? Whose ashes float artfully skyward, swirling and rising in graceful 3D? You'll have to wait and see, but rest easy: the closing battle sequence is an absolute wowzer, both biblical in scale and personal in impact. The epilogue, which caused a lot of fans a lot of angst, is A-OK. And the 3D-conversion job is the finest I've ever seen.
After working as an assistant director, he began making his own films in the 1950s -- which went beyond the then-prevailing neo-realism -- achieving success with his film second about growing up in the provinces ("I Vitelloni") and directing several Oscar-winning films starting with "La Strada." But Fellini was often plagued by fears, even with the success of "La Dolce Vita" (1960), "Amarcord" (1973), "Prova d'orchestra" (1978) and other films. A 1974 annotation refers to his depression, guilt, inertia and self-loathing.

On the strategic level, the administration has chosen to monitor the threat and upgrade as needed  what the Pentagon calls a phased, adaptive approach. The thinking is that even if the Iranians develop a crude nuclear bomb, it will take more time for them to build intercontinental missiles and even more time to miniaturize a nuke and put it on a nosecone.

East Brunswick teachers will be looking at the NJASK results to help determine which students are "at-risk," meaning they are singled out for extra attention from their teachers, Ogden said. But because the state introduced a more rigorous standard for proficiency in the middle grades this year, teachers are having a hard time interpreting the data, Ogden said. If a student was proficient last year and failed this year, teachers have to ask, "Did he change? Or was it the score on the test?" Ogden said.

Steve Sawin of Bridgewater has been singing with the Harmonizers for four years. “Singing at the 9/11 Memorial in Lebanon Township in 2009, ‘10, and ‘11 was very satisfying for me because we were honoring those who died in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11,” Sawin said. “We sang patriotic songs and an armed forces medley. One year we sang ‘The Impossible Dream’ in a football-sized field that had flags set up for all the victims, over 3,000. We sang with more emotion that day than ever before. It was moving. The audience was stunned, just blown away.”

In a press release Monday, Weidel said the Rockland County Medical Examiner ruled the woman’s death a homicide.
Smackdown, which currently and traditionally draws lower ratings then Raw, is the “land of opportunity”. Damien Sandow (formerly Idol Stevens), Abraham Washington, Darren Young, Titus O’Neil and other fresh faces to the top two brands have an opportunity to make a name for themselves. Smackdown will still showcase some major talent weekly, like Sheamus, Alberto Del Rio and Randy Orton, but even those superstars will always make their biggest splash on pay-per-view or Raw.
ST. LOUIS • The public will have a chance to weigh in today on the $57 million project that includes a "park over the highway" connecting downtown St. Louis to the Gateway Arch grounds.
"In my heart, in all of us, we've always found that Jake's recovery, his healing and his survival truly was a miracle. As far as Blessed Kateri becoming a saint, it's honorable to be a part of that process," Jake's mother, Elsa Finkbonner, said.
Orli Shaham is Robertson's wife and has an international reputation as a concert pianist. Her brother Shai is a biochemist at Rockefeller University in New York City and is not a professional musician. He held his own, however, with his sister as they sat together at the piano and did a fine four-hand version of a Slavonic Dance by Dvorak. Don't you just hate people who are that talented?

Then as Rozycke was in his windup, Yung yelled for his pitcher to step off, but Rozycke was already committed, tried to stop and balked allowing DePoy to score, making it 4-3.
Inhaling is more socially acceptable than shooting up. It also is similar to the way that many teens are introduced into the world of opiates – by snorting pills crushed into powder.
Of course, my father, Joe — an excellent and improvisational, recipes-who-needs-'em? cook — had his formula to offer. There are reasons I have demurred. First, he is an impatient man. At some point between 1969 and 1973, he stopped making the dough from scratch and switched to an instant hot roll mix. Then he added chocolate chips. (OK, nobody ever minded the chocolate chips.) Then he decided they would be more healthful if they were baked instead of fried.
The first senior event on the track will be preliminary heats of the women's 800. Preliminaries of the men's 800 will follow. There will be some local interest in that since OTC/Eugene's Nick Symmonds is favored.

Stewart said he thinks development of Ohio shale formations will begin to climb this winter once more testing reveals that the shale is porous enough to be successfully cracked for energy extraction.
Blassingame and Moore's names had surfaced in an investigation into the BAD Bloods street gang - an investigation that was already a year old at the time of their deaths. The "BAD" comes from Beacon, Alcott and Davison streets in the gang's turf - the city's Walnut Park neighborhood. At least some of the roughly 53 members made their money from the sale of crack cocaine and other drugs, investigators believe.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation required airline prices to be more transparent by including government taxes and fees in advertised airfares. But fees for baggage and other extras remain hidden, which can turn a real deal into a real gotcha.

Downstairs neighbor Mario Reyes said he never heard shots fired Wednesday, even though he was home all day. Lucero came downstairs that morning and asked him for a pizza tray. He recalled thinking it was odd because she should have been in school, but he gave her the tray and she went away happy. When he heard a noise upstairs that night, he thought she might have dropped the tray.
One important lesson is speaking up when a student sees another student in trouble or behaving badly.
Diehl’s hand injury never appeared on the injury report. Coach Tom Coughlin mentioned it only when asked by a reporter who saw Diehl headed for X-rays after the Dec. 11 game against the Dallas Cowboys. Coughlin said at that point it was a “nagging” injury with which Diehl was dealing.
William Morris, one of my heroes from my '60s college days and the founder of the English Arts and Crafts movement, set up shop in the Cotswolds in 1871. Morris, a poet, designer and visionary socialist, believed that the Industrial Revolution, while making goods available, had cheapened daily life. Utilitarian things such as bedspreads, curtains, cups and saucers, he argued, should also be beautiful. And handmade.
Rather than spending extra on limited 4G service, my advice is to buy the Wi-Fi-only version and use open networks. You’ll likely use your iPad only at home or the office, anyway, so it’s not a huge issue. 4G service is just another monthly charge, and you probably have enough already.
And it's been a big hit with families around the world.
And here's Troy, who says he met "a very attractive woman" at a downtown club. He lived a hefty commute away, but he would drive into the city every weekend to see her. They would spend most of the weekend together.
CHICAGO (AP) — It turns out you can recycle just about anything these days — even kidneys and other organs donated for transplants.
Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association, said 95 percent of those who participated in a two-week vote on 23 campuses approved of the strike authorization. About 70 percent of 12,501 members voted. Not all faculty are members of the association, which represents 24,000 professors, librarians, coaches and counselors.
I told friends I was coming to Southeast Asia in fall 2010 to see Angkor, a mission accomplished. But for no reason I understood, my real objective was Borobudur, less well known and off the beaten track in the world's most populous Islamic country and a feared breeding ground for Al Qaeda.
For more than a decade, debates have raged over whether the middle class is being squeezed, or shrinking. That also has not been easy to quantify. But as thousands of metro Phoenix residents will tell you, it sure feels like it.

I ignored Hubby's panicked protests (there weren't that many cars on the parking lot that I could run into!) and carefully lifted my Rubenesque rear unto the seat.
“They said he had a fascination with trains and guns, that he had a survivalist mentality and distaste for authority. They said he would likely fight if confronted by police. They said he spent most of his free time in the woods,” police said in an affidavit filed with the court.
Roy, in particular, backed off his Monday pledge to return as early as this week.
That would be true had Santorum's campaign submitted delegate slates there. Regardless, the campaign is chalking up the potentially devastating blunder to spotty organization late last year, when all efforts were focused on Iowa -- Santorum ultimately won the caucuses there -- and the candidate was still a long shot.
"We've gotten to the point that giving a speech or calling for reform is not enough. He is going to have to deliver in order to satisfy the community," said Pacheco, whose group is working with about 17 other students like Cardoso who are facing deportation.
Most reported encounters involve hungry bears raiding backyard bird feeders or toppling garbage bins, but sometimes they're much worse. In a 2006 attack, a 210-pound male bear killed a 6-year-old girl and mauled her 2-year-old brother as well as her mother who tried to fend off the animal. The attack occurred during a family outing in Tennessee's Cherokee National Forest.
The rest of this dish is built around the basic trinity of Cajun cooking -- bell peppers, onion and beans. Chili powder provides the kick. I've trimmed the fat and calories from the protein, which usually consists of ham, sausage or duck. I use leaner chicken and turkey sausage instead.

The big lefty is now 9-0 against the Twins in his last 11 starts (regular season and postseason) dating back to August of 2007.
As Mike Matheny relaxed in his Busch Stadium clubhouse office Thursday morning, the neophyte Cardinals manager engaged in the predictable pregame chatter with the media folks who streamed in and out of the room. Mostly it was rather pleasant stuff, like one interesting conversation about how the fast start by the first-place Cardinals had muted some predictable conversations about what life would be like without future Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa standing on the first dugout step.

Cleanup costs vary depending on the severity of the scene, ranging from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. It can be expensive work because of liability insurance, supplies and the cost of training employees. Homeowners insurance typically covers the cost of cleaning up after a person is found murdered or dead of natural causes, but usually not suicides.
More than 2,500 people stood in line outside the office at mid-day, according to Kyodo News Agency. The office received 10,000 permit requests Wednesday and was on track to exceed that figure for Thursday, Kyodo reported.

At the Seelbach Hilton, another renowned Louisville hotel where Al Capone played blackjack, there's an extensive bourbon collection, including ultra-premium single-barrel bourbons, served in a bar restored to an early 1900s feel. The cocktails are made from scratch, with Kentucky limestone water dispensed from old-fashioned seltzer bottles. The Oakroom at the hotel is one of the city's premier dining spots.
Eric Klinenberg starts his journey with a telling fact: More than 50 percent of American adults are single — a number that has jumped from 22 percent in 1950. And one in seven adults lives alone. Unfortunately, Klinenberg notes, discussions about the single lifestyle "tend to represent it as an unmitigated social problem, a sign of narcissism, fragmentation, and diminished public life." Klinenberg, a professor of sociology at New York University, sets out to debunk this myth.
Here is a look at the first weeks of the trial, and some highlights of witness testimony:
"The thing that's kind of scary about this is that the drug is so effective at pulling plaque out of the brain, at least in mice, that if it does a similar thing in humans we don't know what will happen," Landreth said. "This is brand new stuff. We think it might not be a good idea to rapidly change structural elements in your brain."

Lawyer John Henry Browne said Robert Bales remembers some details from before and after the killings but very little or nothing from the time the military thinks he went on a shooting spree through two Afghan villages.
It's a style Robert Downey Jr. facetiously called "hugely mean-spirited with mildly sinister undertones" at last year's Globes, when Gervais squarely placed Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie and their panned-yet-nominated movie "The Tourist" on his dartboard. Also targeted were the "mature" ladies of "Sex and the City 2" ("I saw one of you in an episode of 'Bonanza'!") and Bruce Willis, who Gervais introduced as "Ashton Kutcher's dad." As for Downey Jr., Gervais began by listing the actor's movies, then said most would know him better from stints at "the Betty Ford clinic and Los Angeles County Jail."

Penn State is the not the only community to face these concerns. Too often, too many have closed their ears and minds, engaged in denial, and otherwise made the decision that child victims are not deserving of justice and protection — especially when someone of communal importance bears responsibility. Enough. This is a cowardly and immoral response. Penn State's trustees should be honored for their courage and moral fortitude.
"If you can't actually tell what it's about, well, judges tend not to be that tolerant of complaints drafted that way," Goldman said. "I'm confident that a bunch of these (allegations) will be wiped out.
A few days before meeting Demetrios at his grandparents' house, I drove to Boelter Hall, on the UCLA campus to see something called the Kleinrock Internet Heritage Site and Archive. In fall 1969, UCLA engineers led by the young professor Leonard Kleinrock used a bulky machine called an Interface Message Processor, or IMP, to communicate with the Stanford Research Institute in Palo Alto.
The lobster bisque was rich without a weigh-you-down guilt that would have been unwelcome on the sweltering day I visited. Generous pieces of shellfish came to the surface with every spoonful of the moderately thick mixture that had a nice splash of sherry: Not too salty, not too heavy, it was just right.
Howard put up such good first-half numbers this season that he was selected to play in his first All-Star Game. His second half was defined by injuries, but he returned in time to finish the regular season. He is capable of making a bigger difference in this series -- and said as much after Tuesday's game.
The Fort Lee man accused of repeatedly running over his girlfriend with his car after she tried to end their relationship plead not guilty Monday, according to CBSNewYork.
2. DON'T SPEND IT ALL IN ONE PLACE.
Then there are the women in the locker room at the YMCA where I swim nearly every morning after the walk. Some I know only by first name. All have been there for me when a family crisis struck, offering to make meals, house visitors, run errands, go grocery shopping, pick up my grandsons from school, do whatever I can farm out to others to ease my burden. (Alas, no one else can write my column!)
Iran was not willing to be an open passageway, however. Dozens of top al-Qaida figures, including one of bin Laden's sons, Omar, were placed under house arrest-style detention. Many were later released, but several high-ranking al-Qaida figures are believed to remain in Iran under close surveillance, including the network's most senior military strategist, Saif al-Adel, one of the alleged masterminds of the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.

It doesn’t matter if these guys are rookies; they’re going to have to step up and contribute.”

LONG BEACH –
"El Camino" (2011): Pop went the pride of Northeast Ohio (by way of Nashville). "El Camino" came on strong with "Lonely Boy," a fierce opener with a pinch of T. Rex glam. A baroque-garage-rock vibe permeated other cuts, including "Gold on the Ceiling" (think Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky" meets Gary Glitter's "Rock and Roll Part 2") and the scuzzy (in a good way) "Money Maker."

This truly is a sound investment that shrinks both our carbon footprint and our utility expenses."

Overall, the new routes should be seen as a sign that outbound Detroit travel is returning to health and Metro is not just being used as a Delta hub transit point for connecting passengers from other places, officials said. Non-hub airlines only add new point-to-point service when they see a demand.
The new editor devoted a lot of his attention to restoring the paper's reputation among advertisers. Its account of the start of the Grand Review -- a two-day parade by the massed forces of the Union army marking the end of formal hostilities -- appeared on a front page dominated by two columns of tiny type listing every city in the states (plus the Washington and Colorado territories and Canada) where The Plain Dealer circulated, as the leading voice of its party and the "only Democratic Daily in Northern Ohio!"

"When it comes to improving our education system, Governor-elect Christie is going to consistently put New Jersey’s children first and not anyone else," said spokeswoman Maria Comella.

Don't forget about the right-centerfield bullpen vantage where you can watch pitchers throw. To be that close, to hear the pop of the ball in the catcher's mitt, puts pitches in perspective.

For that matter, I looked up the coverage this newspaper gave to the Cardinals football team when it moved from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960. The move received less attention than Bradford's recent contract. And a stadium? The team had to share the first Busch Stadium with the baseball team. It practiced in a city park.
Mike Wooldridge, an assistant to the mayor, said Thursday that city officials deny any wrongdoing.
All the action takes place in a cafe where Tommy Lee Jones is seated with a piece of pie, a glass of water and a cup of coffee. He's clearly a regular and on good terms with the waitress, Jane, played by Duggan, the only durably recognizable Buntport member.

Ackerman conceded that the School District must do a better job developing responses to violence, but that getting hundreds of "schools to implement these programs with fidelity is where we still have a long way to go."
The move heated up simmering debate over his successor, with Europe aggressively staking its traditional claim to the post even as fast-growing nations like China and Brazil say it's time to break that monopoly and seek an IMF chief from a developing nation.

The tears from Thursday night, tears he had never cried in public , were long gone, replaced by the Rivera of old. The smile was back.
I have faith that there will be some level head there in this matter, because this is sinking too low even for the clueless.
But before the rest of the story can play out, politicians on both sides needed a clearer answer to one crucial question: How big a mandate for spending cuts did voters really intend to give Boehner and his fellow conservatives?
The neighborhood, which took its name from early German immigrants, is highlighted by its 19th century Italianate architecture. On a cool morning on Elm Street, people sat on front stoops, chatting amiably with each other and greeting passers-by on what at first glance looked like a thriving, friendly residential block. But a look up at windows with only darkness behind them and doors with "No Trespassing" police orders gave it a Potemkin village feel.

Already, heating oil prices have risen by 30 cents per gallon since the last time he filled his heating tanks two months ago. And with 825 gallons of tank space between his home and shoe shop, he’s expecting to pay several hundred dollars more when he fills up next. He even bought a space heater so his wife could keep her feet warm at the store while he continues to lower the thermostat.
West County Fire Chief Dave Frazier Jr. said district vehicles will limit use of sirens near homes.
Not too long ago, he said, BWI's image as a low-fare airport might have deterred high-end businesses from opening there. But that thinking has largely gone out the window, he said.
Like most of us, I'm intrigued by responses of local business owners about weathering the continuing economic crunch. As part of our SJC family, it's important to realize their challenges, observe strategic planning and learn tried and true coping skills from neighboring merchants. In reality, most managing techniques are adaptable to our own lives. Supporting each other is the key. That's what caring communities do.
So there’s no telling what he would have thought about some of the world’s better-paid writers giving some of their material away, one tweet at a time.
With Derrick Rose injured and the Bulls looking for offense, Thibodeau fielded questions about using Hamilton and Korver together and moving Deng to power forward to flood the floor with shooters.

Option 2. Fireproof your exit route. Weakened by a U.S.-armed insurgency against his decade-old Sandinista regime, Daniel Ortega agreed to hold Nicaragua's first free election, in 1990, and lost. Before stepping down, he cut a deal obliging all parties to refrain from post-war retribution. The deal also kept his brother in command of the armed forces. For good measure, the outgoing ruler authorized the hurried distribution of state property worth hundreds of millions of dollars, enriching his Sandinista cohorts. (This so-called piñata included several sprawling homes on the block where I lived at the time.) Thus fortified as an opposition party, the Sandinistas remained powerful and loyal to Mr. Ortega, helping him return to the presidency in elections in 2006 and 2011.
This will go down in the record books, just like the old programs Miller collects from Freese's day at Lafayette High. Freese set a record for single-season batting average, when he was a senior, of .533.
But money plays a role.
I do, however, want the safety net to be there to provide food stamps when a primary breadwinner in a home loses his or her job and the spouse is too ill to work. In such a case, the safety net is not an entrapping “spider web,” as Newt Gingrich has suggested, but rather a means of survival.

"It's largely because the life of a bill is 40 days," Marks, who represents the 5th District including Towson, said before Monday's council meeting. "I would love to keep this bill alive and continue to sort out the issue, but I have to make a decision tonight, and right now there is not the support to pass any sort of legislation that expands mountain biking in Baltimore County's green buffer."

It was the second time in two days that a House panel authorized a subpoena of administration documents. On Wednesday, a House Judiciary subcommittee authorized its chairman to subpoena Department of Homeland Security documents on deportations of illegal immigrants.
Maybe that's why - even though the work received a Pulitzer Prize for drama (for "Part One: Millennium Approaches"), two Tony awards for best play (one for each part) and a host of other honors, it's not easy to find a chance to see "Angels" in its seven-hour-or-so entirety.

They simply choose to remember the humanity Paterno once stood for, which the rest of us are now almost eager to overlook. This is is their right. They deserve to be reminded at a time like this — even as they are assaulted by powerful evidence to the contrary — that this humanity wasn’t invented. It was real.
Both sides say they want to avoid a shutdown, and Democrats are urging Boehner to get negotiations back on track. Late Monday evening, White House chief of staff William Daley called Boehner to try to bring the two sides back to the table.

But it is the report's "Roster of the Ridiculous" that gets the most attention each year, a list of wacky or downright yucky items mixed in among the plastics. For 2010 they included the gas tank (which, with gasoline at nearly $4 a gallon appears nearly unfathomable to throw away nowadays), a thumbnail-sized bag of heroin (which is probably worth less than the gasoline), plastic fingernails, a Home Depot apron, a scooter, human-shaped candles, a ballet slipper, an unopened Census form (take THAT, Uncle Sam!), a beer keg, a can of corned beef and a bottle of syrup (to go with the corned beef, no doubt).

The couple complained to the apartment's owner, who offered a trivial amount of compensation: $150 plus a "free" night on a future stay -- as if these folks would ever want to set foot in that apartment again.

More kids today are obese than used to be the case. If just looking around you at the mall, schoolyard or church doesn’t persuade you of that, check out recent government statistics. A national study for the years 2007-2008 concluded that 16.9 percent of children aged 2 through 19 are obese (defined as weight that is at least 10 percent higher than what is recommended for height and body type). For the years 1971 through 1974, that figure was 5 percent. Heart disease and diabetes are just two of the serious health problems directly linked to childhood obesity.

And Redfern's push to return to the House, where term limits forced him from office in 2008, is "a huge problem," Giardini said. He questioned whether Redfern could devote enough attention to re-electing President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown while seeking office for himself.
For the sake of recap, and my own sanity, those remaining at the start of tonight’s episode on Teams Blake and Christina were are RaeLynn, Jermaine Paul, Jordis Unga and Erin Willett on Team Blake, and Ashley De La Rosa, Chris Mann, Lindsey Pavao and Jesse Campbell on Team Christina.

The problem, as the prince sees it, is the current state of industrialized food production. How can the world create a more sustainable and durable method of food production addressing environmental, economic, public health and quality of life concerns, he asks, amid "so many competing demands for land, in an increasingly volatile climate and when levels of the planet's biodiversity are under such threat or in serious decline?"
Information on the train plot appears to be the first widely circulated intelligence pulled from the raid this week on bin Laden’s hideout in Pakistan.

Participants discussed "vulnerabilities" in the nation's computer infrastructure, said Napolitano, who described the sessions as "very productive." One idea proposed by the university's president, Mohammad Qayoumi, was to create a Center of Academic Excellence at the school focused on cybersecurity. It would work in conjunction with federal agencies, which have set up such centers around the country to conduct research on national security subjects.
When it comes to children, stability is key. They’ve already gone through a lot with the divorce, so I can’t stress how important it is for you two to wait until you’re absolutely certain your relationship is solid. Once you meet, they might become attached, and if you end up breaking up, it’d be a shame to put them through another form of loss and separation.
"So many women are at risk," said Bernstein. "Lack of attention to this problem is what has gotten us to this point, and people who think they know better ought to be in there, showing a better way."

On the door to McNamara's office hangs a sign that says "Bureau de Chef." A bulletin board above her desk is covered with Polaroids of each of the kitchen employees (McNamara's photo hangs in Susie's office with the rest of the front-of-the-house staff). The wall behind her is lined with shelves filled with hundreds of cookbooks. When Yotam Ottolenghi, owner of McNamara's favorite cafe in London, stopped by Joan's for a book signing, he turned her on to a website called Eatyourbooks.com, which indexes recipes from her cookbooks, favorite blogs and magazines. She has 69,477 recipes from seven blogs, 315 magazines and 468 cookbooks.

The music pairs well with the action. "Corteo's" score is rooted in folk and gypsy traditions, and is performed entirely live by costumed musicians, which underscores the period feel of the show. With songs in Spanish, Italian and French, it's easy to imagine that this is what the Old Europe of pre-World War I might have sounded like.

Some traditions remain, despite the dreary economic outlook and the diving Dow.
There are still questions about Oregon's ability to move the ball on offense. And there are fears that the Ducks lack of cohesiveness in game one will manifest itself again against Purdue. And so it feels like we really didn't learn a thing about Oregon's 2009 football team despite the national television, and tough matchup.
LOPATCONG TWP. – This June, four members of the police department will fly to Olive Branch, MS to compete in this year’s National Lawfit Challenge, according to a release from the Lopatcong Township Police Department.
Although Bynum's defense and rebounding has come in spurts, his Game 1 performance marked a turning point in his focus. Still, it remains to be seen whether he could still be as effective in Denver's counters, including better screens and more aggressive play. Because of that, it's unrealistic to think Bynum can still replicate 10 blocks and one turnover. Still, so long as Bynum carries the same mind-set, the Lakers' size will carry them.
He is the sixth person -- all from Jersey City -- to plead guilty in the sweep that netted 44 men and women from New Jersey and New York on a variety of charges that ranged from political corruption to the sale of body parts.

In Class 2, top-ranked Macon fell to No. 3 Centralia and the two teams switched spots. Blair Oaks scored 69 points in its Week 10 win over Montgomery County, but was knocked out of its No. 10 spot in favor of Fair Grove, which undoubtedly picked up some believers when it finished the regular season 10-0. Also, No. 6 Charleston and No. 7 Maplewood-Richmond Heights both won their regular season finales, but still swapped spots.
* I'd be surprised if Fisher chose the Miami Dolphins over the Rams. Again, I could be wrong. But things are a little strange in Miami. Former KC Chiefs GM Carl Peterson, just named team president, is leading the recruitment of Fisher on behalf of owner Steve Ross. But where does that leave Dolphins GM Jeff Ireland? He's been interviewing other candidates including Dolphins assistant Todd Bowles and Chicago Bears special teams coach Dave Toub. Previously, the Miami Herald reported that Peterson recruited Jon Gruden, who declined a chance to return to coaching. Yes: Peterson and Ireland appear to be leading separate job searches in Miami. If you were Fisher, wouldn't this be a warning sign? Sounds like the coach would be stepping into a front-office mine field.

Which brings us back to the madness. What, most fundamentally, should Mr. Samad now ask of us — of our government, of me, or of my family? Whatever his questions, I'm not sure I'd have any answers for him. I'm also not sure anyone responsible for our military involvement in and around his village will have any answers for him either.
The team held a state of the union meeting on Wednesday before taking the PNC Arena ice.

Less impressive is her portrayal of Thatcher's rise from political nobody to royal battleship. She leans too heavily on Thatcher's fancifully monarchical speech pattern and helmet hairdo. Morgan's screenplay doesn't give Streep much to work with, but the performance is almost purely presentational. Thatcher's bearing and unswerving determination may have isolated her, but the other characters come off as ciphers. All Streep has to do is masquerade as an eccentrically styled figurehead.

Spotts designed a marketing plan. His mom called candy manufacturers.

A parent in his or her prime of life is never off the clock. Around the house, you worry when you hear a bad noise from your kids' direction. You worry when it's too quiet. You worry they're becoming TV zombies, so you kick them out of the house. Then you worry they'll play neighborhood cop and throw a bucket at a passing car they think is speeding (happened this summer).

Now and then, Showalter is called upon to untangle the various waves of criticism and revival that works by writers including Dickinson, Sarah Orne Jewett, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Eudora Welty have endured. Her approach in this thorny landscape (feminist criticism can be fierce) is unifying and magnanimous. She brings a perspective to changing literary culture that makes criticism seem not only understandable but also healthy and invigorating, making the work timeless in its ability to weather readers' changing priorities. Dickinson, for example, has been much criticized for her narrow window on life; Jewett and Welty for bourgeois views; and Millay for her self-styled insistence on domesticity.

In both studies, the participants were self-selecting, and its hard not to see the number as anything other than the statistical mean of a vastly wide-ranging spectrum.

The only reasonable solution is to provide attorneys to those immigrant detainees who need them. It would cost, of course, but due process comes with a price. And in some cases, assigning lawyers to detainees could actually lead to savings. The government spends an average of $40,000 a year on each detainee. Providing lawyers could help screen those cases. If a detainee had no legal case or grounds for relief, his attorney could explain that to him, and he would probably agree to leave the country rather than remain in detention, sometimes for years.

Again, even without a central scheme, and five hundred years ahead of Huxley’s schedule, the outcome is depressingly familiar. Books like Charles Murray’s “Coming Apart” have explored how class differences perpetuate and even harden: today two Stanford grads meet at Davos or Google, marry and produce more of same, whereas even a generation ago the classes mingled more: When people weren’t as mobile, a male executive was more likely to have married his neighbor or secretary. On the other side of the class divide, now that there’s no particular stigma to being a single parent, there is a similar feedback loop. You have kids out of wedlock, which means you drop out of school, which means you’re poor, which means your kids follow suit.

Modest, self-effacing, cool to the point of emotional distance, egalitarian, outdoorsy, wholesome, but also sardonic, quirky and decidedly anarchist at times, Brownstein is as Northwest as blown Pilchuck glass. She is also intensely self-critical, whip smart, befuddled by illogical people, maddeningly circumspect, expressive, quick to laugh, supremely self-confident, possessed of an explosive temper and, as an artist, apparently fearless.
But the fourth-quarter numbers limped across the finish line, showing a drop both in dollars and deals compared to the third quarter. And that third quarter represented a decline in activity compared to the second quarter, when investor enthusiasm soared after LinkedIn's initial public offering of stock. During the second quarter of 2011, venture firms poured $7.5 billion into 966 deals. In the most recent quarter, those figures were $6.6 billion and 844.

It's about whether to demand your side or ask for it; trying to control the person you're with or compromising. Is it OK for you to tell your partner how to handle his kids in a situation that has nothing to do with you? Do you have a right to tell her to stop humming all the time because it drives you crazy? Can you forbid him to watch TV in bed?

“From a strategic perspective, I think there’s a question about how much bang for the buck is there in a lot of additional spending on advertising for Romney,” Sides said. The margin of victory in the primary may not effect how well Romney does in November against President Obama.

Some GOP presidential candidates, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have signed a pledge to build a fence along the length of the southern border -- there is already more than 600 miles of towering steel fencing in place. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who does not support a border fence, has proposed adding to the 1,200 National Guard troops currently stationed along the border in a support role. Perry and Gingrich have both spoken of the need for "humanity" in dealing with illegal immigrants who are already here, and were both criticized by conservative Republicans.
Affton should get some more wind in its sails with the return tomorrow of 6-foot-4 senior Jon Tevebaugh, a stellar blocker who has been injured.
Hey, Tom: It's apples and oranges. Fox is a defensive specialist, so he is not tied to a particular offensive system. Pat Shurmur was brought to Cleveland with the marching orders to install the West Coast offense. A quarterback in that system has to operate in the pocket to allow the pass patterns to develop. If he can't, then a new quarterback must be found.
Fortunately, those dishes don't come very often, and there's never a misfire on desserts. Rulli creates more than a dozen each night. When the trilogy of chocolate ($8) was placed before a friend who didn't know the background of the restaurant, she asked who did the desserts, because "you can really see the passion in them." The plate contained an on-point rendition of molten chocolate cake, a rich candy-bar-like rectangle with a thin crisp crust, and a demitasse of rich hot chocolate.

IUDs can be removed at any time before their contraceptive duration expires, which ranges from five to 10 years. Once the IUD is removed (which must be done by an experienced clinician), research shows the woman's fertility returns almost immediately, and there is no evidence of any reproductive impairment. This is one of the most commonly cited reasons some women choose IUDs over permanent forms of birth control, such as tubal ligation, where a woman's fallopian tubes are surgically cut and tied off, intentionally resulting in sterility.
An analysis by the St. Petersburg newspaper showed that judges consistently give shooters a pass - provided they were not violating the law when they went after their victim.

In a sense, food culture seems to be toughing it through economic times because it's not just about dollars and calories. In the Bay Area, food has become the presiding metaphor for a consciously led life: pleasure, politics, identity and love for family all wrapped up in one. And that's one reason why staying home for the holidays may not be cheap, but it's almost guaranteed to be tasty. --

As in recent election years, voters nationwide rate social issues — including abortion and gay marriage — as far less important than the economy or jobs.

We had parted with the stated intention to stay friends, but I mostly avoided him despite his attempts to talk to or spend time with me. The following year, he had to leave school for a while because of mental illness. When he came back, I made an effort to be nice to him and do things with him, but I had a new boyfriend and T had a hard time accepting that. T began repeatedly calling my house, asking my friends about me and, after I went to college, repeatedly emailing me. This made me so uncomfortable that I finally sent him an email asking him to never contact me again. I have not heard from him since.
Being bad is one thing. Being bad and boring is the quickest way to create the negativity that former UF coach Urban Meyer used to refer to as "Gator nonsense." Florida fans, like most fans, want to win championships, but if you want to keep them happy in the meantime then give them an offense that's entertaining.

"Obviously, he's not swinging the same," said Lowe, who faced Pujols with the Dodgers and Braves the past seven seasons (and with the Red Sox in the 2004 World Series). "I don't care if you're a Hall of Famer like he is – confidence is everything in this game. When you start losing it and you start to question yourself (you start to press).
When Ruess first watched an early cut of the commercial, he wasn't sure if it was the type of kismet he wanted: "A car doing kick-flips or whatever the heck it is — if we had heard that was going to be the case, we probably would have said, 'No way.'" But he quickly began to enjoy it, especially how the "epic" ambience of the ad matched the feel of the song. When it aired during the Super Bowl, his main focus was waiting for his parents to call. After two hours, he couldn't stand it and texted them. They texted back, "Good job!"

The Standard & Poor's 500 index moved above its average close of the past 200 days, 1,108. The 200-day moving average is a technical level watched by many traders.

One side note: While there's evidence that EPA omega-3s may cut the risk of precancerous colon polyps (we've both had them removed), don't take extra EPA without consulting your doc. It can trigger both clotting and bleeding problems, and it doesn't play nice with certain drugs.
"This is going to be an extraordinary experience for people at the local level," said Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex), a reluctant partner in the compromise legislation shaped by Christie and Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester). "They will go to the polls and vote for an override in some instances, but that’s not going to be the case in every community."

Next year will see the release of three films that appeared on the 2011 festival circuit, "The Innkeepers," "Kill List" and "You're Next," all of which show that a bit of gore and a little brains (as in wit and smarts) need not be mutually exclusive. Fresh, vibrant filmmaking is happening on the indie horror scene, as kids raised on VHS cheapies have grown up to turn the form inside-out.
And - as with other types of high-tech equipment that hospitals market aggressively to attract patients who could go elsewhere - the proliferation of robotic systems can mean fewer procedures being done at each institution, a potential problem when higher volume is related to better outcomes.
Indeed, if his business is on a roll, so is de la Renta's relevance as a designer. His most recent collection, for spring 2012, was met with rave reviews. Critics praised his "exuberance" and cited the "insouciant luxe" that he does "like no one else," as well as a new "edginess" that reinvigorated his typical "glamour and elegance." At the show, Justin Timberlake and Ashley Olsen took front-row seats with such longtime clients as Barbara Walters. The mix of age and sensibility reflects his clientele. (Walters might go for the embroidered day dresses, and Olsen could easily carry off the crush pleated silk tulle strapless gown.) His multigenerational appeal may well lie in the fact that the designer himself is forever looking forward. He says—in an "Oscar-ism" inscribed on resin bangles sold only on the brand's Facebook page: "I have the memory of a mosquito." Astonishingly, he has never kept a single archive. "Why should I?" he asks. "I love now and tomorrow. What I did in the past doesn't interest me."
Administrators say that on the days kids would be home, teachers still would be on the job, working together to improve student learning.
