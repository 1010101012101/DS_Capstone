Convenience store owners around Mission Bay say the economic downturn was only worsened by a ban on alcohol that was adopted in response to a 2007 Labor Day melee between police and beach goers on Pacific Beach.

Those crisp slices of French baguette with whipped butter were divine. The fragrant saffron sauce in the bouillabaisse offered a delightful journey — slightly dense, a bit coddling, a sophisticated end note.

For virtuoso accounts of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” and great Concerto in F, look no further than suave French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet’s new live recording (Decca), which matches Ferdinand Grofé’s original jazz-band arrangements to Baltimore Symphony players.

He is the only non-Cardinal to have signed the ball, and why he signed it at all is unclear. He was the final out of the seven-game Series, having been caught trying to steal second base in the bottom of the ninth inning. Finch explained that the story goes that a baseball was being passed around the clubhouse or the field for Cardinals to sign, and Ruth -- by then deep into his stardom as baseball's most recognizable face and name -- had just gotten in the habit of signing any ball that came near him.

"An exciting player," he replied without hesitation. "I value myself as a team player and someone who can really ignite an offense at the head of the lineup or in the middle. I'm capable of hitting for power and driving runners in, plus there's nothing like getting on base and being driven in by somebody too."
He couldn't believe what the corps was contemplating.

In the middle of Oscar season, I am like a baseball fan at a cricket match. Some of what's happening looks vaguely familiar to me, but I couldn't begin to tell you what the score is, or what all the cheering is about. I've seen exactly one movie in a theater in the past five years, and that was only because a friend dragged me. The last movie that was meaningful to me was "Hustle and Flow," and that had as much to do with the music as it did with the story. If you haven't seen it, "Hustle and Flow" was a fable (all the movies I've ever liked are fables) about Southern g-rap, and it successfully dramatized all of the metaphors that make the style so gripping. There were drug dealers and pimps, strip clubs and old model sedans, God and church music, and desperate people on the grind; plus, as one character says to another, "heavy percussion, repetitive hooks, sexually suggestive lyrics, man, it's all blues, brother."

We treat our children, who end up specializing in one sport at a young age, like professional athletes, he said. Some children will end up playing one sport year-round while even pro athletes get an offseason to recover and recuperate. Hyman has talked to doctors who say they've seen young athletes unable to tell their parents they want to stop playing to the extent that they develop psychosomatic injuries as a way to escape a sport. If you ask a child why he or she plays a sport, the most common response is because they want to have fun. When did parents lose sight of that simple goal?

(The only harm might be to the owner who might use the opener too often.) Available in all sizes with matching leads.

While I’ve spent many years following the Portland Timbers in various leagues in addition to my weekly checks of results for West Ham and Sunderland, I was actually wandering into uncharted territory in covering the United States – Canada international friendly at JELD-WEN Field on September 22. While I’ve watched many USWNT matches on television, attended the Women’s World Cup matches here in Portland back in 2003 and made the occasional trek to the bluff in support of the University of Portland women’s team, this was my first opportunity to witness the USWNT up close and in person. I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect, and with the Timbers playing San Jose the previous night, it gave me a great opportunity to compare and contrast the atmosphere.

The irony is Acta was willing to intentionally walk Jose Bautista in the 12th inning, loading the bases with two outs. That was a decision that came from his gut and went against the book. The Indians got out of the inning on a fly ball.
Though the bare bones of R.C.'s life do not indicate the evolution of his thinking, he did leave at least one record of his intellectual development and mentors. For many years, R.C. wrote a daily column that appeared on the editorial pages of all his newspapers. This column was originally titled "Common Ground," but then changed to "Better Jobs," because R.C. believed that was a commonly shared interest of most people. In a three-part series in his "Better Jobs" column of late 1955, R.C. discussed "My Handicap:"

The North American colony that was the most profoundly affected by this type of unequal relationship wasn't the American South but Mexico. Over the centuries, racially mixed people there became the majority population. Historian Woodrow Borah identified the one policy that contributed most to the mixture in Mexico as the Spanish crown's decision in 1630 to allow Indian laborers to contract individually with their Spanish overlords. The conquest set the stage; the economic relationship did the rest.

The Gunther character reflects much of Germany's 20th-century history. He served in the German army in the losing cause of World War I. Back home in Berlin, he became a homicide detective. When World War II broke out, he got dragooned into the SS as a military cop and sent to the Eastern Front, then to occupied Paris. Later, as an intelligence officer, Gunther got captured by the Soviet army and was shipped off to a POW camp. After two years of misery, he escaped, returned to Berlin and then made his way to Cuba.

The reason they were here together was Grisham. He wrote a new novel about baseball, "Calico Joe," a pleasant day at the park of a book about beanballs, retaliation, forgiveness, centered around a fateful game between the Cubs and the Mets. Grisham had come in from New York. He'd just driven by Yankee Stadium hours before: "Man, I hate the Yankees. I see Yankees fans wearing Yankees hats and just want to smack those Yankee hats off their heads. You know, slap their faces. Just hate them." He was also here at Wrigley to throw out the first pitch, something Turow's done before, of course, Turow said, with a big smirk. As we watched Grisham slip into a custom-made Cubs jersey with "Grisham" slapped on the back, Turow said: "I told him my advice for this was dress warm. Also, and this is hilarious, but a lot of people plan this out for weeks, train for weeks, throw pitches in their backyards for weeks before they get here, and then they are so nervous, no kidding, they go through the windup and never release the ball!" The caustic stadium speakers blared music and promotions and said nothing. Turow looked into the rafters, annoyed. "They never RELEASE THE BALL! Can you hear me? Boy, they just don't shut up at all with that stuff do they?"

Canadian bacon is usually salted and cured, so the flavor is closer to that of ham than bacon, and at about $4 for a 6- to 8-ounce package, it's thrifty, too. It's also a great choice for weeknight meals because the sweet, succulent meat is already cooked, so it makes a great go-to when you want some savory pork flavor but don't feel like messing with raw pork.

This is a long room, so think in terms of two seating groups. We think you need to purchase a simple, stylish sofa in a neutral tone for the right side of the room, and two matching chairs in an accent color to place slightly angled toward each other opposite the sofa. Your sofa accent pillows can pick up the color of the chairs.
There becomes a point when all the stories about declining music sales read the same, and so you don't read as many as you used to, or maybe should and so I'm sure someone has made the point I'm about to make, but I don't know who.

How a new bond package could be crafted to gain voter approval as soon as November -- one possibility the school board is considering -- is unclear. Regan said the district will research, potentially through polls or focus groups, what factors caused about 7 percent of district voters to accept higher property taxes for teaching jobs but not to
ø"He just couldn't quite ever get it going," Simpson said. "I've only played with him a few times, so I don't know his game that well. But you know, he hit a lot of good shots, and I think it wouldn't surprise me at all if he's playing next week really well."
Mason, who missed the first 16 games, was out of step and not up to speed with his teammates, even though his skill and athleticism were evident the moment he took the floor. The 6-4 Nwamu, initially just a shooting spark off the bench, was slowed by defensive shortcomings.
A majority of the deals, all but 37 of them, were approved through the agency's most popular program, known as the 7(a). Wells Fargo has extended 41 loans worth a combined $20.1 million through that program since October. Rival U.S. Bank approved 60 loans totaling $10.5 million.

Our first stop was a visit to the huge, cacophonous central market, where Sterling chatted with his favorite vendors and clued us in on how to choose the best produce. The suburban factory where Ki Xocolatl, sold in the Centro, is made, was next. Owned by a Belgian couple, it combines the prized Maya criollo chocolate vanilla with European chocolate-making processes; I am forever hooked on their dark semi-sweet chocolate with red pepper, cardamom and vanilla.
Dolan's most notable accomplishment was a significant decrease in violent crime. Rates dropped in most major urban centers during the same period, and it would be simplistic to credit police work for all of that progress. However, police chiefs often get blamed when crime rises, and they should receive some of the praise when rates fall.

While the council hopes the Coliseum plan might save Oakland's teams, during a committee meeting last week, council member Nancy Nadel offered fans some words of caution.
Missouri Education Commissioner Chris Nicastro said Freeman has been instrumental in helping the state determine the best course of action for the city's schools. "So often when we deal with school issues we get caught up with adult issues, and Frankie is one of those rare individuals who always thinks about what's best for kids," Nicastro said.

Time Magazine dinged her performance in 1978's "Somebody Killed Her Husband" by claiming she "gets into serious trouble every time she opens her mouth to speak. Giggling and shrieking fits aside, her voice is flat and expressionless; her face cannot convey any emotion other than blissful self-absorption." Her other two post-"Angels" vehicles -- the 1979 thriller "Sunburn" and the 1980 sci-fi disaster "Saturn 3" -- did no better with either critics or moviegoers, and Fawcett's brief window of superstardom slammed shut.
I never knew the Pan Am portrayed in the show, the classy airline that circled the globe. Its glory was in the days before airline deregulation, when it could operate foreign-only routes at a profit. Airline deregulation in 1978 pushed Pan Am to compete with domestic carriers, with disastrous results. By the time I flew the airline in 1988, it was a shadow of itself, carrying passengers in creaky, early-vintage 747s between Los Angeles and London. A later flight on what turned out to be a leased Airbus had to land in Bangor, Maine, when it ran low on fuel. It wasn't long before the airline vacated its headquarters (since renamed the MetLife Building), sold its overseas routes and, after a few fitful restarts, disappeared. The Worldport became Terminal 3.

And that, some key players inside the state's prison system have come to believe, makes events such as the inmate "Hamlet" important. Something to see. Something to do. Something to break the monotony, maybe even spark a breakthrough in attitude.
Although Myanmar's military-backed government has released hundreds of well-known dissidents over the past year as part of a startling series of reforms that have earned it lavish praise and an easing of sanctions, rights advocates say hundreds more remain wrongfully locked away—their cases in danger of being forgotten amid rising hope for a more open, democratic nation.

For that matter, filings in the case showed that the aggregate value of equities - whatever that is - for Katz when the brewery was sold was $12,216,182. How do you find a jury in this city that will believe somebody with that kind of payout was a victim of discrimination?

“Anna Gristina-Gorr has not been convicted of anything,” the family notes on the website, echoing a frequent complaint by all defendants needing to raise bail. “She awaits trial on Riker’s Island, with an unjust bail, set higher than the charge against her warrants.

Real criminals, such as alleged rapists, murders and child molesters have been required to pay less bail than she.

State Historic Preservation Officer Milford Donaldson disagreed with the staff's recommendation, calling it "troubling" and "short-sighted."

The Blazers are in love with Batum's potential and versatility, but they remain frustrated by his lack of aggressiveness -- aside from occasional spurts. Batum says he's always been that way, going back to his early playing days as a child in France, and he's starting to realize he needs to shake the trait to develop into the force the Blazers think he can become.
Many surveys point to food trucks and high-end hamburgers as trends that are still on the rise, although some, like Sign On San Diego's, note indications of backlash against them. In addition, Marian Salzman of Euro RSCG Worldwide PR sees corporate brands hopping on to the food truck bandwagon.
Dogs acclimate to where they spend most of their time, so even a husky living in a climate-controlled house may not be ready for long hours outside in cold weather. Older dogs and puppies are also less able to cope with cold. And certain drugs may affect a dog’s ability to withstand cold, so if your dog is on any medications check with your vet.
I'm not suggesting that Bing -- a proud man whose distaste for braggadocio should not be confused with humility -- is consciously throwing the fight of his life. But when he considers the range of surprises the rest of 2012 may hold for him, the prospect of someone else being awakened by a 3 a.m. phone call the next time the power goes out, a police officer is gunned down, or a tanker filled with noxious gases is T-boned by a drunken motorist can hardly be the scariest scenario under the sun.

Stronghold in the Portland Music Industry, Music Millennium needs true Music Lovers: If you've lived in Portland for any substantial amount of time, then you've at least heard of Music Millennium. A local, humble record store, MM is far more than it appears, and Terry Currier (head chieftain) remains a believer in independent, local music despite the state of the music industry. CD sales are bottoming out, vinyl record sales are trying to come back, and MP3's are taking over, but an intangible element is keeping things alive... for now.

Until, that is, he finds himself on a plane with the rest of the workers that crashes, in a harrowing scene, in the middle of frozen nowhere. Among the survivors are Ottway, of course, as well as Diaz (Frank Grillo), a short-tempered ex-con; Talget (Dermot Mulroney); Burke (Nonso Anozie); and Hendrick (Dallas Roberts). These are not exactly team players, and they don't take well to Ottway seizing a leadership position. However, it quickly becomes apparent that he is the only one of them with a working knowledge of wolves -- handy -- and their behavior.

When Gasol shows up there, Lakers fans won’t notice him as much as they once did, but he is worth being cheered louder than ever.
Where are the bishops' priorities today? In recent years, church leaders have opposed historic health care reform, lashed out at the University of Notre Dame for inviting President Barack Obama to give a commencement address, and publicly chastised pro-choice Catholic politicians even as they give a pass to Catholic lawmakers who push economic policies antithetical to Catholic teaching about the common good. The bishops' decades of advocacy for comprehensive health care took a detour last year when they opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because of concerns it would provide taxpayer funding of abortion — a flawed policy analysis, according to independent experts, some pro-life lawmakers and even the Catholic Health Association.

Regardless of the proposed project, no one argues that Highway 1 has a morning commuter bottleneck.

Also here are Marcel Proust, Coco Chanel, Ernest Hemingway and Josephine Baker.
Option 1. Lead your people to democracy. Flight Lt. Jerry John Rawlings abruptly changed course in Ghana after his military dictatorship failed at socialist governance and ran out of money. He revived the economy by liberalizing, then allowed open political competition and was freely elected president twice. By embracing democracy before there was much demand for it from citizens, he gained popularity and lowered the risk of payback for prior violent excesses. He slid securely into retirement in 2001, abiding by term limits after 20 years at the helm.

Chin: If the offense at issue is whether you're undocumented, the Supreme Court has said race is permissible (as a factor). If police see someone speaking Spanish, who appears to be Mexican, is in a Mexican neighborhood, they know from other situations this is a neighborhood where a high number of people are undocumented, that certainly looks like a basis to inquire.
She said she is recommending cutting elementary and middle school PE teachers across the board, rather than asking each school to decide which staff members to cut, largely because principals asked for a uniform cut across the district. PE teachers won't necessarily be the ones laid off, she noted, because an experienced physical education teacher who is certified in another area would have the right to bump a less-experienced colleague in that field.

Of course, the story of Phoenix, a Pit bull twin brothers are accused of setting on fire, a case that brought national attention to animal cruelty in Baltimore.
If workers reject the pact nationwide, Ford could lock out workers, immediately cutting off paychecks. It could also shut down plants such as the ones in Minnesota and Walton Hills immediately instead of working on an orderly wind-down with the union that would allow most employees to transfer or retire.
The way to reap the real benefits is to stick with it, she says. Her eight-week courses teach students the basics, but like many Eastern practices, tai chi is a way of life more than a way of staying fit, a philosophy more than an exercise.
Investigators say John R. Mercurio Jr., 48, of Belleville, Michigan was driving a red 2007 Dodge Ram towing a trailer carrying a classic car along I-75. In the front seat was Laurie Mercurio, 66, and the back seat, John Mercurio Sr., 69, both also of Belleville.
"If you ask me would I rather have a team with a lot of steals or a team that's blocking a lot of shots, I want the team that's blocking a lot of shots," said Calipari. "You're not going to shoot a lot of layups. You're going to shoot a lot of jump shots. The field goal defense is going to be good. If you lead the nation in steals, you're probably giving up a ton of layups, and I go nuts."
At the urging of the Cardinals and his new pitching coach, Dennis "El Presidente" Martinez, Gorgen is deploying a curveball this year in addition to a quality fastball and the changeup that he's rode through lower levels. Gorgen, 23, has struck out 36 batters and walked 12 in 35 2/3 innings this season, holding opponents to a .211 batting average. He's been particularly difficult on lefties, holding them to a .188 average in 55 plate appearances.

But Scott responded that "while the government may enforce longstanding prohibitions on the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, an absolute ban on possession in entire neighborhoods and regions would surely violate the 2nd Amendment."
Campbell, meanwhile, was not recruited by a single Division I football program -- despite being a hardworking, hard-hitting defensive back. With the help of his father, he sent 30-40 letters to colleges looking for an opportunity to join a team as a walk-on. Only Akron responded. He would have to earn his way onto the team and to a scholarship, but he had a chance.
Soon, one would think, Harkless is going to be the first St. John’s freshman to declare for the NBA since Omar Cook was a second-round bust in 2001.

However, as I hold one eye to the lawsuit, I will put the rest of my energies toward organizing a strong constituency in the event of a 2012 ballot initiative. The Maryland IAF has experience in doing successful referendum campaigns. We were a major player on the statewide handgun campaign in 1988. And across the nation, the Industrial Areas Foundation is known for our ability to mobilize large numbers of people. Organizing people power is what we do well. We did so in order to build the multi-racial support to help ensure the passage of the Dream Act. We will do so again in order to make sure that the law prevails.
Towards the end of the first half, Pacifica fouled in the box giving Extreme a huge opportunity with a penalty kick. Though a great diving attempt was made by goalie Nathalie Grogan, the kick was good for a 1-0 lead.
The A's got to Doubront for four runs in the fourth. Suzuki singled with one out, Kila Ka'aihue walked and Cliff Pennington drove in Suzuki with a double.

“The shame of it is that you play that hard to get back in the game and kind of not hold your cool enough to finish it out,’’ OSU coach Craig Robinson said.
And then there is the Sunni-Shiite divide in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq, or the Palestinian-Bedouin divide in Jordan, or the Muslim-Coptic Christian divide in Egypt. These sectarian divisions have prevented national leaders from emerging -- and no Arab Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King Jr. has been able to rise above them to heal the rifts. Without such leaders there is too little trust in the room to do big, hard things together, and everything that these Arab societies need to do today is big and hard and can only be done together. Who will tell the people that Arab societies have no time anymore to be consumed by these sectarian divisions, which just drive everyone into their own ghettos or out of the region altogether?
Kent would need to run a time of 45.30 to meet the Olympic Trials A qualifying standard. It's probably a reach. But it also was a reach to letter in three sports as a varsity athlete at a school in a BCS conference. I'm reluctant to shut the door on an athlete with that much drive and that much athletic ability.
Thankfully, RuPaul has anticipated my consternation this week, returning a previously-eliminated contestant for me to wish ill upon.

The new law, sponsored by state Sen. Bill Haine, D-Alton, was a major priority for area legislators and political leaders.

Even people who keep their jobs often see their real income drop as inflation and insurance costs grow. Fifty million Americans fear illness because they have no health insurance. The "Occupy" movements spread because people have lost their faith in the future and feel that the "American Dream" has been taken from them.
Some people wonder if body parts will wash ashore. The quake and tsunami killed almost 20,000 people. Again, unlikely, given the distance and conditions at sea between Japan and the Pacific Northwest.
"I've heard all kind of people tell be Edwardsville is so different from other towns," he said. "I don't know anything about that because I've lived here all my life. Maybe Edwardsville is special. But I think when you have a thing that's a good thing, people identify with it in some way. Somehow it just resonates with people and they say you know what, that's a worthy cause. So I'd like think everybody is pretty much the same."
For that matter, I remember talking to Anne Keefe when she was hosting a show called "Healthy Living" for Channel 9. We were in a bar. She was smoking a cigarette and drinking Irish whiskey. I asked if she ever felt strange about hosting a show on healthy living.

Hey, Hoynsie: You mentioned that the sixth and seventh spots in the pen are open and talked about the recent signees, like Dan Wheeler and Chris Ray, but you didn't mention Nick Hagadone and Chen Lee.

Kirshner, a New York native, got his start as a songwriter and music publisher, working with the likes of Neil Diamond and Neil Sedaka. Making the jump to television, Kirshner became a driving force behind the Monkees and the Archies.

This year, fans will be the "Fifth Judge" during the Denny's Slam Dunk Championship by voting via Twitter. Fans can vote on every dunk by simply tweeting #CollegeSlam, followed by the player’s last name and a score between one and ten (E.g. #CollegeSlam #Smith10). From there, Mass Relevance, the technology leader in social curation and integration, will calculate all fan scores and deliver an average rating via their platform. That rating will be presented as the “Fifth Judge” and paired with four celebrity judges' scores to make up each player's total score.

"I'm not a GM, so I can't really say that. It's not my job," Aldridge said. "When we won the last three games at home, it wasn't an issue of us fitting was it?

With the Chiefs taking Michigan receiver Junior Hemingway at 238, all of the expected Big Ten receivers have disappeared off the board.

The allegations against Sandusky, who started The Second Mile in 1977, range from sexual advances to touching to oral and anal sex.

In 69 big league plate appearances, Montero showed he could hit for average (.328 batting average), hit for power (four doubles, four home runs) and get on base (.406 on base percentage). To top it off, in the postseason, Montero went 2 for 2 with an RBI in his only two trips to the plate.

Bond, Schoeneck & King, the law firm UO hired to conduct a parallel investigation to the NCAA's, recently billed the university $5,812.50 for "review, conferencing and correspondence" work performed in January.

Even if the sight of cars racing at up to 200 miles per hour down Pratt Street toward the Inner Harbor doesn't rev your engine, the idea of adding another sporting event with the economic impact of the Preakness to Baltimore should. That's why the Board of Estimates' anticipated decision today to approve a five-year agreement with Baltimore Racing Development to bring an annual Indy Car race to the city, possibly in August of 2011, deserves cautious optimism. We're still a long way from seeing Danica Patrick fueling up at a pit stop near Camden Yards -- Indy Car's governing body hasn't committed to the race yet -- but the groundwork that has been laid so far suggests that the odds of it coming here are good. The city just needs to make sure it will be as positive an event as its sponsors promise.

No thanks. We’ll await the truly newsworthy, and we can think of only two such examples: The owners publicly admit that they want to bust the union, in which case every fan in America should go after them with a meat cleaver; or the union pulls off a gambit that thumbs its nose at high-profile agents and their players and protects the bank of the rank-and-file.

JJ: Actually, you touch upon the greatest Rimbaud mystery of all. Somewhere right around the time of his Java adventure, most likely before it, Rimbaud stopped writing poetry. He was just 21. But what does it mean, to stop writing? Does a writer in a dry spell stop being a writer, even if the drought lasts the rest of his life? All we know is that he never again gave a poem to anyone to read, not that we know about. He might have written hundreds of pages of poetry that he burned. It is entirely possible that the lost journals of his voyage to the tropics may turn up someday in a moldering old trunk in a country house in Java. But the basic law of literary scholarship is: You have to go with what you've got.

WHAT HAPPENED: Miguel Cabrera's two-run homer in the first launched the Tigers to the romp. Prince Fielder hit his first Tigers homer in the third, when he and Alex Avila both cleared the opposite-field fence in left. Then Cabrera and Fielder homered back-to-back in the fifth. That made five homers off Boston right-hander Josh Beckett. Duane Below took over for Doug Fister (strained side) in the fourth and went 2 1/3 shutout innings for the win.

The bar area, which has a 12-seat counter and four tables against a shoulder-high teak partition, sets the mood of the dining room, which is located on the other side. Large windows let in the cityscape, which includes a row of olive trees Keller planted in 1998 and window boxes filled with golden tufts of feather grass, evoking the California countryside. Long filament lights on black cords dangle from the ceiling over two rows of tables, looking like New Age test tubes. Sensuously smooth, generously sized teak tables, cork tile floors and blue upholstered Thonet chairs, an icon of midcentury modern decor, help define the contemporary look.

To be fair (and Spin occasionally strives for fairness) Heckert didn't cling to the idea of Montario Hardesty (his pick) as the feature back. Holmgren wasn't stubborn enough to mandate another year of McCoy (his pick) being surrounded by better weapons. The Browns deserve credit for that. They recognized their mistakes, their misplaced hopes, and they were in agreement on the remedies.

This will be the second time that American has combined with another major airline. The airline took over TWA in 2001, which had offered nonstop service from Orange County to St. Louis. That's long gone. Those of us with long memories remember that American Airlines bought out Newport Beach-based Air Cal in 1987. At the time, critics howled because the two airlines would have 37 of 66 landing and takeoff “slots” at John Wayne Airport. No need to worry. American ended up dropping the Air Cal routes over the years.

Calhoun, a Park Slope resident, found it ironic that he helped Queens beat his home borough. But that didn’t stop him from going all out.
Indianapolis (1st Pick) - Haven't we known who the Colts were going to draft since about Week 5 of last season? Once the Colts turned to the 3-headed monster of Kerry Collins, Curtis Painter, and Dan Orlovsky at quarterback, the talk of Andrew Luck to Indy took over. While other teams were joining the "Suck for Luck" campaign, few did it with the committment that the Colts showed. For their 2-14 effort they now have the chance to take a quarterback that some have called a "once in a generation" player. The Stanford product has drawn comparisons to John Elway among others, and if there is one way to ease the pain of seeing Peyton Manning in another uniform, it would be getting a future star in Luck. With this draft being deep at the wide receiver position, look for Indy to also try to grab a playmaker later in the draft to pair with Luck for the next decade or so.

Friday night, we saw something that we won't see often. Boone RB A.J. Turman, who's no little guy himself at 6-foot-1, 194 pounds, came through the middle on one of his 22 carries with Amone charging. The impact could be heard in the parking lot, and it knocked Amone backward. He still made the tackle with help from his friends, but it was a rare punch that staggered the junior prospect. Of course, Amone would get his, possibly saving a touchdown on a Turman run later in the game.

As we settled into our traditional spot in the northwest corner of the pitch, I noticed multiple small groups of girls’ soccer teams being lead around the stadium to perform various duties for the night. The lucky young women selected to be ball kids for the night beamed in anticipation of being able to throw a ball to one of their heroes while also watching the match from an unbelievable vantage point. As the groups moved about listening to instructions from the stadium staff, some players splintered off quickly to take a picture for posterity to remember the night. The buzz was building as soon the players would be entering the area for warmups, and the calls for various players by name was already starting.
