It's part of their Republican DNA, said Nick Kovasity, 73, of Ortonville. He lived in eastern Europe during World War II, an experience that he says has made democracy very real in his life.
In reality, neither Cameron nor the multiculturalists have the answer for creating cohesion in modern, diverse, globalized states. Multiculturalists think ethnic cultural continuity will somehow mask the wrenching and sometimes dangerous break with the past that newcomers face. Cameron fantasizes that a reinvigorated, hard-sell approach will make abstract liberal ideals into a tie that binds as tightly as ancient tribal or religious bonds.
(Be careful here, too, though: keep pets away from rakes, hoes and other tools that can injure curious paws. And if Fluffy or Fido accompanies you in the garden, don't forget to close the fence or gate behind you).
We could have paired our Venetian statue with a sculpture, possibly Parisian in a striped black-and-white shirt and beret, but we opted for Caesar himself. His subjects may hail him, but he's enamored with his newest sculpture. Or at least that's the story we decided to tell. And not for nothing, our model raved that the Caesar outfit was by far the most comfy thing he's ever worn in public.

A “what if” tour of the final invasion is frustrating, yet easy. Frustrating in that there are no markers for a battle that never occurred, and maps are in just a few specialty books on the subject. Easy in that most of the Coronet sites are an easy day trip from Tokyo.

"That's probably the best offensive team Lutheran's had for at least the last 10 years," Lueck said. "We were pretty potent. We didn't have anybody hit .450, but we had a lot of people hitting in the mid-.300s. This was, probably, the best baseball team Lutheran's had."

Under the old policy (called good funds in the industry), Fifth Third deducted a customer's money before it ever started processing the electronic or mailed payment. Now, the money is deducted on the day the payment posts or the check clears. (This policy is called risk-based.) The difference means the customer has the money in her account for several extra days, potentially. (Banks like Chase, Huntington and Ohio Savings deduct the money before the transaction is processed. Banks like U.S. Bank, PNC, Charter One and FirstMerit deduct the money after.)
"It's all made up. I'm not dumb," she said.
"Camps with families packed into little sheds," Shawcross said. "No heat. No water. Communal bathrooms. It's like living in a Third World country."
"It is remarkable how cross-cultural it is to give something up. And the assumption in all of the traditions is that giving up bodily pleasures leads to some kind of spiritual benefit because it focuses the spirit on things of ultimate consequence rather than on things that are passing away," said Peter J. Thuesen, chairman of the department of religious studies at IUPUI.
"We thought Bryan could line up there at guard and give us some efficient plays. We think he did that," Spagnuolo said. "There were a couple places where he struggled, but going forward he's just going to get better and better, and that's a good thing."

“It feels a lot better this week,” Nicks said on Tuesday of his sprained shoulder. “I’m just trying to go out there and play and have a good week of practice. There should be no setbacks.

Most people are accustomed to buying bulbs based on watts, which refers to energy usage. Soon, they'll buy based on actual brightness, which is measured in something called lumens. That's because manufacturers have figured out a way to produce the same amount of light with fewer watts. For example, a typical halogen-incandescent model today needs only 43 watts to create 800 lumens—the same brightness as a 60-watt incandescent bulb.
Clementi committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge later that day.
Schaeuble said that "if the Greeks have an idea for what more we can do to encourage growth, we can always talk about it and consider that."

Orange will be a new addition to the closet, and newness is what drives purchases, Hilfiger said in a phone interview. "I feel very strongly about 2012: I think people over the last couple of years have been conservative with buying clothes. Eventually you have to refresh the wardrobe."
Sidebar: As chronicled here in a recent blog, but I think worth repeating here, germane as it is to the current subject, my late second cousin, CBS and ABC newscaster Cecil Brown, was one of Edward R. Murrow's "boys" during World War Two. His most famous book was "Suez to Singapore". The British warship HMS Repulse, from which he was reporting a few days following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, was torpedoed in the western Pacific and cousin Cecil was rescued just moments before he almost drowned while clinging to a piece of debris. He also has a star for radio news excellence on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. My grandmother and his mother were sisters. He and my Mom both shared their childhoods together in my native Pittsburgh, as well as later years in Cleveland, and I had the honor to share many great dinners with him and his wife, Martha, during my 1950s acting days on national television in New York. Heavy-duty memories of some truly great times I was blessed to experience.
Before Mr. Williams steps aside - and he should - he and his fellow county office holders should give up their payroll records. Otherwise, the public will have every reason to suspect that more Fred Robinsons are out there.

Bin Laden also showed a flair for two essential aspects of any successful organization: management and media relations. A onetime student of economics at Jidda's King Abdulaziz University and the offspring of one of Saudi Arabia's most successful businessmen, bin Laden brought business school techniques to the task of organizing a global terrorist network. He appointed managers and set up computerized personnel and payroll systems reminiscent of any other start-up company. Peter Bergen has called al-Qaida "the most bureaucratic terrorist organization in history."

If Mr. Santorum reciprocates, maybe not immediately, but eventually, the healing of the divisive primary campaign will have been achieved. If Mr. Santorum does the job well enough, he could find himself in a Romney cabinet, say, secretary of Health and Human Services, where he could focus on those moral and cultural issues about which he cares so much. Or, he might even be Mr. Romney's choice for vice president. There have been stranger bedfellows in American politics.

That leaves the mayor, who was unavailable for comment. There are many passengers in this story, and clearly, someone needs to step up if this is going to happen in Colangelo's lifetime. Just think of how shameful it would be for this to happen posthumously, like Ron Santo's induction into baseball's Hall of Fame.

Even though both chefs have the same ideals and use scrupulously fresh ingredients, their products are very different. Stoll, for example, bakes his pizza in a Marsel oven, which gets hotter than the 600 degrees registered on his thermometer.

DNA evidence doesn't solve these problems — it can only tell us just how bad they are — and it exists in only about 10 percent of criminal cases, far fewer than one would think from watching TV crime shows like CSI.

Based on his history with Thad Matta at Xavier and Ohio State, John Groce surely knows the deal. ‘‘Coaching ‘em up'' like Bo Ryan does at Wisconsin can keep you in contention in the Big Ten and get you to the Sweet 16 on a regular basis if you're good at what you do. But if you want to get beyond that at Illinois, you better hone your ability to develop ‘‘relationships'' - wink-wink - into an artform. That's how the big winners get it done.

Stratton — or Thumb — was already very famous when he met Bump in January 1863, while she was making her debut at the American Museum. Their celebrity was such that they toured the world as the Tom Thumb Company from 1863 to 1878 and traveled with Barnum's circus in 1881. Hauser's book describes Bump's life from her first memories to her husband's death.

I would recommend listing the items that you would want to use during an outage. You can use the owner's manual or call the manufacturer (important to have the model number available) to determine how many watts of power it takes to run the items on your list. Add up the running watts needed for your list - this will help you select the proper generator. Generators come in all shapes and sizes and a variety of prices. Take the information you have gathered to your local home improvement store, and an associate can help you choose the best generator.

"I think the talk about experience gets exaggerated," said La Russa, who took over the Chicago White Sox after less than two years as a minor-league manager. "Even if you have experience, there are issues. You're part of a coaching staff, but you're not the coach. There's a certain responsibility that attaches to that leadership role. I'm sure Mike will do a good job of delegating. But what do you delegate? That's ultimately his decision."

4. Al Weiss. The president of Walt Disney World seems to befuddle our panelists. Some ranked him as high as No. 1. A couple left him off their ballot all together. Still, most gave Weiss, 51, high marks, saying there is no doubt he controls the biggest game in town.

Plus, whatever clout he's had with Disney -- one of the nation's largest companies -- is about to be magnified, since Weiss was recently promoted to president of Disney's Worldwide Operations. He's up one notch in this year's ranking with plans to remain in Orlando.

It's hard to pinpoint just how widespread the problem is. Researchers at Cornell University recently presented a paper in which they tried to quantify the frequency of this so-called deceptive "opinion spamming." They concluded that it is a growing problem overall and is a bigger issue for websites like Yelp and TripAdvisor that allow anyone to post a review as opposed to websites where you are required to have eaten at the restaurant or stayed at the hotel in question before you can review the place.

Starr: It's a great little city that has a strong sense of community and volunteerism and schools. Boiled down, it's a wonderful place to raise a family and be from. I can't help but tag something on to that, though. As a city councilor, I will fight to try and preserve that (identity). I'm finding myself being the person on council who is pushing back on Metro the most, because I don't want Wilsonville to become another Portland.

For example, the Fidelity Strategic Income fund is a four-star fund with a yield of 4.86 percent.

Our kids need to learn skills that can't be performed better and cheaper by robots.

For this review, I am not mainly referring to Siri, the widely publicized, voice-controlled feature on the new iPhones, which can do things like tell you the weather, or stock prices.

New Orleans: In this poor man's Paris, cabs and covers are cheap, and sensual little courtyards plentiful; there's even the occasional dungeon or two. If you can't have fun in New Orleans, you can't have fun. Start the day with beignets at Café du Monde. At lunch, wander Decatur Street for a muffaletta sandwich. Or canoodle all day, then come out at night. Hop a streetcar for a drink at the Columns Hotel, where scenes from "Pretty Baby" were shot. Then on to nearby Tipitina's, or "Tips," for live music and dancing. Time doesn't just stand still in New Orleans; it disappears. And so can you.

Menendez had been worried for months that Jon Corzine, the governor at the time, was letting the gubernatorial race get away from him. Since the beginning of 2009, Menendez said he was trying to convince Corzine to engage forcefully in his re-election effort against Republican Chris Christie.

She received a load of press coverage when she made her social debut in 1961. Town and Country magazine named the spirited Connecticut College student debutante of the year and put her picture on the cover.
"Every mother I know that has made it into a leadership position has a supportive husband. My husband has a very demanding job as a surgeon, but he has, at times, sacrificed his interests for mine.

"It gets so frustrating listening to the two groups," Jothen said. "Both sides are passionate about their argument, but that passion can easily become a misrepresentation."

That's the premise of "Missing," ABC's stylish nail-biter premiering Thursday night and starring Ashley Judd as Becca Winstone, who has spent the 10 years since her husband was killed by a car bomb overprotecting their son, Michael (Nick Eversman). Against her better instincts, she allows him to go off to Rome to study architecture, but talks to him by cell phone almost every day. Then the calls stop for a week and Becca goes into a panic and then into action.
"A pepper and egg sandwich is pre-made by definition. The very best have a bit of mystery attached. As in, ‘Tony's mom makes a pan of these in the basement of her two-flat and brings them into his beef stand every Friday.' You can actually see the pan on the table but you never ever actually see Tony's mom. Also, it helps if there's a rumor of some mystery ingredient.

It estimated that between Chrysler and its suppliers, the Fenton plant closures cost St. Louis 8,900 jobs, held by people spread from Franklin County to the Metro East area. Add in the effect of spending by Chrysler workers and suppliers, and the number of jobs affected by the plant closure balloons to 43,000, and $15 billion in spending.

We then went to the make shift tent, and they put us on flatbed trucks and we went up and down Pearl Harbor, checking for more attacks."
Altman struggled at Kansas State (68-54 overall, 19-27 conference) and that has to give you pause. He never finished above .500 in conference play at K-State. And his hiring is making a lot of basketball insiders and coaches who wanted this job (See: Bennett, Randy) scratch their heads

We will pay for this plan, we’ll pay down our debt, and we’ll do it by following the same principle that every family follows: We’ll make sure that government lives within its means.

In another, bin Laden delivers advice to Jaish al-Islam, a militant group in the Gaza Strip, which asked whether it was acceptable to take money from Iran and Shiite Muslim groups, which some Sunni Muslims consider to be infidels. (Bin Laden is Sunni.) Bin Laden replied that accepting these monies for the sake of using it to conduct jihad and to strike the Jews is better than abandoning the jihad due to paucity of funds. So take it, if there is no other way, and strike the Jews. . . . And aim well!

At the end of the defense of his remarks in 1922, DuBois observed: "The scars and foibles of the Great do not diminish but enhance the worth and meaning of their upward struggle." So it is with Lincoln's scars and foibles. Amid the eloquent evocations of his deathless words during the bicentennial we should bear in mind that their author was one of us -- which means that perhaps, just perhaps, another Lincoln may emerge from the present to redeem our past and give us a future worthy of the American promise.

San Francisco has its own Green Business Program, with on-site audits, that includes a list of eight hotels.

Take Ekho Moskvy, often pointed to as one of the few truly independent media outlets in the country, which has been harassed, fined and constantly threatened with prosecution under the "extremism law" for daring to report news unfriendly to Putin. Or just look at the yearly reports from the Committee to Protect Journalists, which documents the appalling and threatening conditions under which anti-regime journalists are forced to work. There are few that haven't heard the name of Anna Politkovskaya, the anti-Kremlin journalist who was gunned down on Putin's birthday in 2006, but the CPJ reports demonstrate that her situation is hardly unique. And speaking of memories of the Cold War, what was the first thing that popped into your head, Andrew, after you heard of the polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London? Was it, perhaps, the 1978 murder of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov, who was killed by the KGB in London using a poison-tipped umbrella?

Against my better judgment, I went to the Cream and Crimson game for two reasons: One, I wanted to see if the Hoosiers looked any bigger and faster than they did after a year in which they managed to fail to beat a single FBS (formerly Division I-A) team all season. Two, because during a parents weekend at my kid's sorority, my daughter was still not awake and ready to roll at noon and I needed something to do.

With "Red-Headed Woman" (1932), written by the formidable Anita Loos, the actress and her film roles started to hit their stride as Harlow's gift for wised-up comic dialogue became evident.

Look for future heartthrob Charles Boyer in his first significant American role.
The Grind is not pretty, and “Viking Shores” pulls no punches. The Faroese send boats out into the ocean to find pilot whales, which are cetaceans not as large as the fin or minke whales hunted by the Japanese, but are slightly bigger than dolphins. Then they herd the mammals toward one of several dozen beaches on the islands, where residents lie in wait. As the powerful creatures beach themselves in panic, hunters wade into them with long curved hooks and slaughter the whole pod in a bloody frenzy. The Faroese eat a lot of pilot whale.

Russian artillery barrages turned Grozny, the Chechen capital, into jagged ruins. Soldiers and police hunted down rebels, their supporters — and, many critics say, hapless and innocent civilians. The Kremlin backed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's notoriously brutal security force and poured billions of dollars into reconstructing Grozny.
New political forces will emerge from the outside or the inside. A semi-crackpot outsider like Donald Trump could storm the gates and achieve astonishing political stature. Alternatively, insiders like the Simpson-Bowles commission or the Senate's bipartisan "Gang of Six" could assert authority and recreate a strong centrist political establishment, such as the nation enjoyed in the 1950s.

And in the case of so-called Stafford loans, schools are not on the hook in any way; they are simply acting as collection agencies, and in fact may get paid for their efforts at collection.

Republicans have called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act unconstitutional since before Obama signed it into law in March 2010. But only one of the four federal appeals courts that have considered the health care overhaul has struck down even a part of the law.
He noted that the clinic, which was not licensed to perform abortions, was a "dangerous environment for any potential resuscitation." He cited expired drugs, lack of oxygen and dangerous drugs stored in mislabeled drawers. Sathyavagiswaran said that in his opinion, "the death occurred at the hands of the physician due to his action and inaction."
"He's one of the hardest working bigs in the league," Brown said. "He's athletic, he's agile, he's tough. He's got a nose or feel for where that ball's going to be. If you don't put a body on him he'll hurt you on that glass. He has worked extremely hard on his game. He's gotten to a point where that 17-foot jump shot is now almost a lay-up for him. It's pretty automatic. He's quick. He can take to the rim off the dribble."
That means that for the period through Sept. 30, Ganley's congressional campaign has retained or spent $1,080,200 of Tom Ganley's personal fortune, not the $2 million or more that is widely reported.
If the raw material was there, the area is beginning to enjoy the benefits of more fastidious farming - not necessarily to Napa's perfectionist levels but just a few tweaks in trellising and soil work to bring out the best of an area that needs just a touch of polish to shine.
Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan on Tuesday foreshadowed big spending cuts to achieve what he described as a "modest" surplus in the fiscal year beginning July 1.

17. Adam Scott, Australia -- Scott has played only four times this season and apparently will continue to follow the less-is-more schedule given that only two other tournaments are listed on the schedule page at adamscott.com. One is the Ballantine's Championship this week at Blackstone Golf Club in Seoul, South Korea, and he will return to the PGA Tour in two weeks for the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass. … The Aussie has not played in South Korea for several years and obviously is receiving a handsome appearance fee to play for the first time in the Ballantine's, which is co-sanctioned by the European Tour and the Asian Tour. However, he does have a strong record in Asia, having won the 2005 Singapore Open, the 2005 Johnnie Walker Classic in Beijing, the 2006 Singapore Open and the 2010 Barclays Singapore Open. While much of the field will come from the Asian Tour, also entered are Open champion Darren Clarke, Paul Casey, Ian Poulter and Miguel Angel Jimenez. … Last week, Scott skipped the Valero Texas Open, a tournament he won in 2010 to help get his career going in the right direction again after he had not won in two years on the PGA Tour. Conventional wisdom would seem to indicate that he needs to get more competitive rounds under his belt with the busy summer season approaching, starting with the U.S. Open at the Olympic Club in June. Scott closed with a brilliant 6-under-par 66 to tie for eighth in the Masters, but he seemed a bit rusty the rest of the week, especially with his long putter. He hopes to be strong from the start in Korea.

Find another doctor. (I was tempted to say, "Run for your life!") As warm, charming, caring and attentive as your doctor may be, her poor hygiene is a danger to your health.

When asked if too much is being made of the anniversary, Bolton said, "It's a legitimate question — and I don't think we have a choice."
For the nation as a whole, federal experts also see relief for consumers, partly because global oil prices have unexpectedly fallen over the last month. That's because the global economy is not recovering at the rate once expected, and because geopolitical tensions have relaxed a bit.
"I want them to compete," new CSU coach Jim McElwain said Thursday after the final practice before the spring game. "It's a game. To me, every time they put themselves on film, they're telling a lot about who they are. So what we say on the daily basis is, 'Be proud of what you put on video.' "
President Obama has called the Republican-backed Defense of Marriage Amendment divisive, saying it would discriminate against gays.
They ranged from sunny, to sleet, to deluge-style rain and at least what seemed to qualify as a momentary snowfall. During most of it, the winds were brisk, so the MVPs of the day might have been the small groups of fans who not only came to the stadium but stuck around to the finish.

Also, a key piece of the puzzle -- the blowout preventer that failed to stop the oil from leaking from the well off the Louisiana coast -- was raised from the water on Saturday. As of Tuesday afternoon, it had not reached a NASA facility in New Orleans where government investigators planned to analyze it, so those conclusions will not be part of BP's report.

The line has divided Washington. Many environmentalists and Democrats have criticized it for furthering American dependence on fossil fuels, especially since much of the fresh Canadian oil that the line would bring would come from Canada's oil-sands industry. Oil sands, essentially bitumen mixed with quartz sand, takes more energy and thus produces a higher carbon footprint, by many measures, than conventional drilling.
In a soft voice, she tells me, "In (elementary and high) school, all students are encouraged to dream big. Yet when we get to community college, they deny it from you."

The Tibetan Buddhist master Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche spent his life in the West confounding expectations and behaving in ways no one could anticipate or even understand. After 17 years of marriage, his wife found him "completely unfathomable" and his devoted students often felt the same. How, then, to make a film about a man who categorically resists summarization?
VATICAN CITY -- Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday brought 22 Catholic churchmen into the elite club of cardinals who will elect his successor, cementing the Italian majority in a future conclave but also giving New York's garrulous archbishop a position of prominence.
The costs of this failure are high both in the destruction of bay water quality and the contamination of groundwater: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that 15 percent of all Delmarva drinking water wells contained nitrates exceeding EPA maximum-contaminant levels. More than 70 percent of all wells tested had nitrate. A USGS study concluded that "Concentrations of nitrate and herbicide concentrations in ground water of the Delmarva Peninsula are among the highest in the Nation." The major source of this excessive nitrogen is chicken and other animal manure, as well as chemical fertilizers.

Enter Collins. Why he came into the game remains a mystery. No offense to Collins, but the guy didn't belong on the field.

DG: There is a reason why that approach wouldn't work, and quite simply it's called "the known quantity." If you were to, say, take the $25 million planned for Pujols and split it into a $12-million shortstop, a $5-million second baseman and $8 million more to spend on prospects you are taking a lottery-level gamble. One reason they're called prospects is because they don't have a track record. The Cardinals invested more than $1 million in a third base prospect from the Dominican and a couple years later Roberto De La Cruz has yet to ascend beyond the Johnson City roster. The Cardinals signed Nick Punto to a $750,000 for 2011 and got a utility player who contributed to the major-league team. Honest question: Who offered the better return? The Cardinals have increased the amount of emphasis and money they devote to prospects, both identifying and signing them. But one of the reasons why Pujols can command such a high salary is because he's a known quantity. Given his health, the Cardinals can bank on the return they'll get from their investment. Can you say the same if you shift the dollars into more speculative ventures?
NEWARK — An Essex County grand jury has declined to indict a Newark special police officer charged in April with collecting money for hours he never worked. The decision, which was announced today, dismisses the case.
