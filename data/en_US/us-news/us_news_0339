Government cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity. They cannot tax the rich into creating jobs for the middle-class or poor.

"He just continues to build on it and it's a great example for many athletes to understand what he did, what it took. He actually came into the locker room last year and gave us a little talk about how he got there and all the things that he's done. How much he's done is incredible. But also it takes good partnerships, good relationships, and he invested his time to do that, so I think he's definitely somebody we all should all look up to as far as post-career basketball."

Even better, because the massaged greens have such a wonderful texture and just the right mix of sweet and bitter flavor, you don't need much of a salad dressing. Use a little good olive oil and a pinch of salt when you're giving it a rubdown and all you need afterward is a hint of acidity — vinegar or lemon juice — to make a perfectly balanced salad.

Purchasing. To estimate how much wallpaper you'll need, multiply the space's width by its height, then divide by 50 (a standard roll covers about 56 square feet). The result, rounded up, is the number of rolls you'll need. Because rolls vary so much in price, from $30 to more than $200, it's difficult to estimate the cost of a whole room. It can range from $600 to $1,200. While prices are quoted in terms of single rolls, they're usually sold in double rolls (which are double the price). To complicate things more, commercial paper is often priced by the yard.

First, Mr. Romney proposes a cap on noneconomic damages for medical malpractice. This evidence-based strategy for reducing malpractice premiums and improving physician supply traditionally has been supported by Republicans. Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, has suggested that even some Democrats could support a federal noneconomic damage cap if it concentrated on physicians, was higher than the Republican plan offered in HR-5, and had a mechanism to control premium increases. Mr. Obama has yet to personally offer a concrete solution to physicians' medical malpractice concerns.

To pull off its recovery, Ireland is counting on a rise in exports. Exports include not only agricultural products such as milk and meat, but also pharmaceuticals, medical devices and technology services such as call-center work.

"Watch the Throne," which drops on August 8, is an unusual beast: a joint release by two artists whose solo discs do just fine on their own. Imagine Beyonce cutting an entire album (and touring!) with Lady Gaga, or Taylor Swift sharing stages and grooves with Carrie Underwood, and you begin to understand the improbability of this collaboration. High-profile joint releases are not always successful, but initial returns are encouraging. "Otis," the latest Jay-Z/Kanye West single, finds the two emcees breathing fire over a sample of "Try a Little Tenderness." In its clever references to soul music past and its slamming beat, it's quintessential West. In its gleeful celebration of conspicuous consumption, it's quintessential Jay-Z. (An earlier joint single, "H.A.M." was arty and ambitious, but not quite so infectious; it will be an extra track appended to the deluxe version of "Watch the Throne.")

"Iron Man" is a thrill-jolt start to the summer blockbuster season. The Marvel comics hero is brought beautifully to life by director Jon Favreau, who keeps the film focused on characters and story.

After winning one of his two gold medals in the Sydney 2000 Olympics, sprinter Maurice Green rented a bright yellow Ferrari convertible and tooled around the city, drawing crowds, attracting attention. He drove the thing to Bondi Beach, kissed girls, posed for photos and talked about how tough it was to stay loose. He became his own distraction.

Finally, there is the orange-hued Motel 6, which was the first of the bottom-rung budget chain built in the United States. You'll pay more for less by the beach, but for most people, it's the Santa Barbara they came to experience.
Saxton said the new vote means the district, with 12,691 students enrolled, will be "unharmed" but would also "do no harm."

The schools available to take new students generally border districts nearby that are also taking kids, Saxton said.

NEWARK — A northern New Jersey man charged in the shooting death of his girlfriend's toddler son is due to be arraigned today.
Some might answer Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio, but a late-season knee injury ruined his slim chances. More than that, Irving alone makes the Cavs competitive. He can dribble, drive, shoot and pass -- and despite being the No. 1 overall draft pick, he’s better than most folks envisioned. The question isn’t whether Irving deserves the award, it’s if he’ll be the first guard to ever win it via unanimous vote. (Big men Griffin, David Robinson and Tim Duncan are the only other three to win it unanimously.) Runners-up: Ricky Rubio, PG, Timberwolves; Kenneth Faried, F, Nuggets.

Find a sweeping corner, and the Fiat's nose admirably refuses to push wide. It's as drift-happy as the Cooper, with steering that's nearly as quick-witted and brakes that feel just as strong.

Here's Richman on Ping: (Chef Andy) Ricker has assembled a menu that's multi-Asian, not Asian-fusion, the dishes rigorously executed and tasting uncannily authentic--there isn't much kowtowing to the West. The room has an industrial ceiling with exposed pipes, but every new restaurant in Portland has that. Here's where it gets interesting: walls made from crappy old wood, shelves filled with vintage radios scavenged from a repair shop that used to be next door.

The last night, an annual salmon bake features slabs of chinook nestled on alder stakes straddling a fire pit; the roasted fish goes well with a salad of radicchio, Castelvetrano olive tapenade, housemade mozzarella, pine nuts and preserved lemon -- one of six stunning accompaniments. After dinner everyone clusters around a station where each vintner brings out his or her best wines -- everyone's nose is deep in the glasses, swirling, sniffing, gurgling, spitting and occasionally swallowing with delight, deep in transcendent pinot dreams.

Next season is all set up: The big revelation in the finale was that Johnny Crowder has been spying for Limehouse, against his cousin Boyd. (Another TV rule: when someone is talking about a traitor and the camera goes in for a closeup on a particular character, that character is the traitor.) Johnny has reason to have a grudge against Boyd and Ava and the means to do something about it. It's Limehouse vs. Boyd, the thrilla in Harlanilla!

If there was a knock on LaMarcus Aldridge's game in the past, it was his tendency to float closer to the perimeter than play in the paint. The strength of his game was his ability to knock down the 15- or 18-foot jumper. But with every made 18 footer, the label of power forward came more from position than play.

Our friend Addison loves the autumn because her QuirkOut idea shaves time off the morning routine. Her Schick schedule changes with the seasons. In spring, she only shaves up to her calves - what will show when she wears capris. Summer means the full-body Nair treatment and landscaping. But fall and winter? Let's just say her razor is on hiatus. You can enjoy this freedom too, as long as it wasn't mentioned in your marriage vows.

Those weaknesses can be fixed during film sessions and by spending endless hours in a gym. More troubling is Evans' lack of production in two other critical areas: defense and rebounding. He has averaged only 2.5 rebounds during his last six games, including none in Friday's loss to Oklahoma City. He seldom gets his large, quick hands on loose balls anymore and seems emotionally disengaged. (In fairness, the Kings' defensive commitment in general is nonexistent. The last three opponents shot 53, 58 and 52 percent, respectively.)

A few years ago, Mr. Stuart visited Wagoner, a man he says provided comfort and stability with his music and presence on television. "Porter was just sitting around, staring at walls," he recalled.

He thought he'd have to make a contemporary country record to be heard."

The whole shebang, pun very much intended, may or may not be based on a truly tragic tale of the pizza guy-turned-bank robber blown to smithereens after he was coerced (or not) into wearing an explosive device by two goons similar to the ones played here.

Then you meet John Wooden and he is answering his own phone, he clips his nails with a drugstore clipper, his haircut has a faint bunkhouse bowl look to it, his clothes are less Savile Row than bought-with-a-coupon, and the whole thing cries out for a Grant Wood brush, not a shrill sports column.

After they drafted offensive tackle Riley Reiff in the first round because he tumbled down the draft and into their appreciative laps, I figured they would go with another offensive player with one of their two Friday selections.

Some repetitive passages could be cut or trimmed, but, for the most part, Newman's delivery brings out Paley's penchant for a well-turned phrase in prose and the emotional power of her conversational poetry.

There are also two single-vineyard wines. The 2009 Calvarino Soave Classico ($30), from a vineyard the family has held since the early 1900s, is about 30 percent trebbiano di Soave and is very fragrant and expansive, with citrus, green apple, a salty minerality and a long finish. The 2009 La Rocca Soave Classico ($30), from a vineyard that overlooks the medieval walled town of Soave, is the only Pieropan Soave that spends time in oak; it's powerful and creamy, with nice freshness and a long finish. Both wines age well, too.
"Any series it's important to get an early win," McLellan said. "We're starting on the road. Not many of you experts are predicting us to win, so it's nice to sneak one out here. Our goal now changes from winning one to winning two and moving forward. It's the first time in a long while we've played with the lead against them (but after falling behind) to come back in the third period was important. Some real important key points for our team, but we know it will get tougher as time goes on."

Today, thanks to him, a thriving community of high-quality potters, silversmiths, cabinetmakers, weavers, furniture designers, cheese crafters and other cottage manufacturers flourishes in the Cotswolds. Dropping in on these artists as part of a tour of the more well-known sights is a great way to get a personal feel for the region and find some lovely gifts, as well.
