Anyway, here's a reality Hollywood rarely reminds us of: Historically, women and babies died in childbirth all the time. (They still do in parts of the world.) Yet, women kept having those little ones anyway.

“Derby Day was the one day growing up when all eyes in the country were on Louisville,” Key recalls. “We always thought that Louisville was a super special place, and Kentucky Derby Day is the one day in the year when the rest of the world gets to realize that too. It’s a special day, it’s almost like Christmas if you live there. And for us, for Antietam, this particular Derby day is literally the 28th anniversary of the forming of our band.

Every 18 months, the reactor is shut down for about a month to "refuel." About 40 percent of these fuel assemblies are replaced, with the older ones moved into the spent fuel pool.

Pole position: Danielle and her friends go to Squeeze Lounge for some stripper pole lessons: "Since Steve, I've had problems feeling comfortable with any part of my body at all." Really?

We're sure he has a few friends who are Danielle's speed. Kim takes the first crack at the stripper pole.

Here she is, for instance, on Janis Joplin's band, Big Brother & the Holding Company, and the rise of the cult of musicianship, which she decries as antithetical to rock 'n' roll's populist roots: "I was a Big Brother fan.

I thought it was an ominous sign that so many people did care, including Janis. It was, in fact, a sign that the tenuous alliance between mass culture and bohemianism ... was breaking down."

NEW YORK -- Personal finance media personality Suze Orman is thinking big. She's the first out of the gate in the fast-growing prepaid debit card market with a card that aims to help its users build a credit score. It's a gamble that could pay off, if it can help create a way measure the creditworthiness of millions who function outside the traditional financial system.
Xcel Energy, which owns the Sherco power plant near Becker, is required to add controls on the plant's two oldest units, but not expensive SCR technology.

Administrators who do not investigate reported incidents of bullying would be disciplined, while students who bully could be suspended or expelled. School employees would also be required to report all incidents they learn of, whether they took place in or outside of school.
Fleisig added, speaking in general about these injuries, “It is easy to decide that an almost completely torn UCL needs surgery to continue pitching, and a slightly torn one does not, but many cases are in the middle and need discussion and joint decision-making between the doctor and the patient.”

John Czarnecki, FoxSports.com, A: "The entire key to their draft is whether LSU's Michael Brockers can be a dominant defensive tackle and if Appalachian State's Brian Quick is an immediate deep weapon for Sam Bradford. Can he really be T.O.? . . . Several teams had first-round grades on Montana cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who was taken 65th overall . . . Cincinnati's Isaiah Pead is a great change-up running back to Steven Jackson's power . . . If Jenkins can stay clean and produce, this can be a great draft based on the two future first-round picks Washington gave them for RGIII. But my memory is that Rams coach Jeff Fisher already failed with Pacman Jones in Tennessee. Take it from Jenkins, who railed against the idea that he should be compared to Pacman: ‘No, because I never shot up a strip club or nothing like that!' . . . Wake Forest receiver Chris Givens has second-round talent, but seventh-round character. He could be a dynamic slot receiver. Missouri Western kicker Greg Zuerlein made 9 of 9 field goals from 50 yards or more last season. Zuerlein gets tremendous height and also can kick off. The Rams definitely improved their overall team speed - remember, they signed veteran cornerback Cortland Finnegan in free-agency - and now the coaching staff carries the burden of coaching these young men up."

"Four months ago, all anyone talked about was the $14 trillion debt," Warren told me during her visit. "And how many cuts we'll have to make. Occupy Wall Street changed the conversation to 99 and 1."

Health insurance, when it did emerge on a mass basis, came from the business world, as exemplified by the Kaiser shipyard story.

But the IRS allowed companies to offer benefits up to 5% of the value of wages without counting them as taxable income.
The Jayhawks, removing a few long touchdown passes to all-world receiver Ryan Broyles, played well in coverage and tackled in open space. KU forced three turnovers  it had forced just two entering the OU game, which was worst in the country. OU's Heisman Trophy candidate, quarterback Landry Jones, completed just 60 percent of his passes, and the Sooners had to settle for field goals on four of their seven trips to the red zone.

ALPER: What Republican solutions are you talking about? Haven't heard any. The GOP strategy will be to simply attack Democrats with made-up information. The Obama campaign will likely point out the merits of his plan to turn our country around, highlight accomplishments by saying there's more to be done, and highlight Republican efforts to obstruct progress -- like rejecting his jobs plan. Then they'll point out the extreme views held by the Republicans and how they advocate for the wealthy special interests.

Anyone who reads advice books about romance has one problem to begin with: bad taste in literature. The idea that a book can advise a woman how to capture a man is touchingly naive. Books advising men how to capture women are far less common, perhaps because few men are willing to admit to such a difficulty. For both genders I recommend a good novel, offering scenarios you might learn from, if only because they reflect a lot of doubt.

That William Trevor has not yet received the Nobel Prize in Literature strikes me as a shame. Surely his absence from the list of laureates has more to do with the politics of national identity than a clear-eyed assessment of merit; no author writing in English today can claim a more extensive or accomplished body of prose. Trevor has published 14 novels and 12 collections of short stories as well as plays, works of nonfiction and the novellas "Nights at the Alexandra" and "Two Lives" (which contains the incandescent "Reading Turgenev" and "My House in Umbria").

The causes can include, but are not limited to, stroke, cervical spine injury, spinal cord pathology, intrinsic nerve pathology, dietary deficiency, infectious disease and previous trauma. The patient with cubital tunnel syndrome will often complain of numbness and tingling in the ring and small finger. They may also complain of weakness in the hand.

The physician may also be able to detect weakness in the hand and, in long-standing, severe cases, wasting of the small muscles of the hand. The diagnosis may be aided with electrophysiologic studies.

To him, no Israeli misdeed is too small that it can't serve as an alibi for Palestinian malfeasance.

Edwards borrows a metaphor from the father of another dead child she met through a support network, describing the family as a table with four legs. Wade's death knocked one of the legs out and as the family struggled to balance the essentials of their lives on it, the table kept tipping over until they managed to reconfigure it into a three-legger.

Jane Scott heard. The Plain Dealer's "Young Ohio" reporter became the city's first rock critic, one of the first on a daily paper, when it was still standard for scribes to cluck about the "noise" that wouldn't last and the kids would outgrow. She met and heard everyone over the next four decades, from garage bands to superstars, and put their names in the paper. She made rock coverage respectable, and a weapon in media turf wars. Cleveland got dance lessons in the newspaper, and Jane had a song written for her.

His four-bedroom Alpharetta home sat on the market nearly all of last year. One potential offer of $585,000 would have left him with a $80,000 loss, he said. By last fall, Bullock realized the market wasn’t improving and decided to rent out his property.

That's especially the case with makhni tikka ($16), where the creamy tomato sauce cloaks each piece of tandoori chicken in a tongue-tingling blend of herbs and spices. Paniz also demonstrates skill with okra: She slices the pods lengthwise into strips ($6), dusts them with mango powder and fries them so they're crisp and slightly chewy. In another preparation, she stews coins of okra with onions and tomatoes, chiles, red onions and ginger ($9); the recipe is classic, but it avoids the long-cooked, oily texture that predominates in some versions.

If Quade is the pick, I hope they let him bring in his own bench and base coaches, though Ivan DeJesus did a fine job at third and Bobby Dernier at first the last six weeks and could be brought back. Either Ken Macha or Jerry Manuel would be a decent bench coach, and Quade is friends with both. I'm not sure Ryne would want to coach since his goal is to manage in the majors. I expect Alan Trammell to go to Arizona and be the bench coach for Kirk Gibson, who was his bench coach in Detroit.

øThere's another consideration, too. If the global economic system collapses, just owning a gold ETF probably isn't going to cut it.

I'm not suggesting this is a good idea, but if gold is your ultimate backstop, you'll want to have it in your possession.

FIP does not reflect that.

A: I think it's going to change how we care for people. Right now we're caring for people on a kind of transactional basis. So at each episode, we are caring for them. So they get sick today.

Why it's hot: DJ/VJ Rob Pittman has been at the helm of this popular '80s night since before '80s music was retro chic. Every Monday night, crowds of longtime regulars and new faces head to the Castle for his selections, which have grown to include music from throughout the '90s and into the last decade, as well as a great mix of tunes that venture well past the typical '80s night fare. Four large screens surround the upstairs dance floor, where dancers on platforms gyrate to the synthpop and pop anthems of yesteryear, while others lounge around the massive bar or hang out in the Red Room Bar, an adjoining refuge from the main ballroom. Downstairs is a more laid-back affair, with DJ Sean playing the darker side of the night's mixes in the courtyard attached to the downstairs Saloon.
This Christmas, let everyone take a moment for the real story. Let us take stock of how we treat the young in the dawn of life, the poor in the pit of life, the elderly in the dusk of life.

ø•Messages. Apple's iChat instant messenger and chat service is being replaced by iMessage, the Mac version of a feature that arrived with iOS 5. The result: You can send messages to or from a Mac to anyone who has an iOS device. Conversations in iMessage are kept up to date across all your computers and devices. And you can send pictures, high-definition video and other attachments up to 100 megabytes in size. You can also send group messages and receive a "read receipt" that lets you know when a person has seen your missive. Through a typing indicator, you will know when the recipient is readying a response. There's also a FaceTime button within the Messages app that lets you launch a video call. And Messages works with the same instant-messaging services that iChat supported, including AIM, Yahoo, Google Talk and Jabber.

As Pelosi's No. 1 priority, a change in the course of the war would be trumpeted as a great accomplishment.

A two-week cottage rental will cost her as much as $1,200 upfront. "That's a real pretty penny," she said.
The Niese deal represents a way of doing business not often seen before in New York. Not that the Mets and Yankees haven’t signed young players before they’d reached the three years of MLB service time that qualifies them for salary arbitration, or the six years that earns them the right to free agency.

Considering that the Lakers likely won't be tested on defense, it remains to be seen how they'll handle the situation. Either they'll view it as an opportunity to sharpen their fundamentals or they'll use it an excuse to cut corners again.

The zócalo is an ideal place to read in the shade, try out restaurants at random, browse the street market and poke into shops and galleries.

To start with, we’ve had the recent re-entry malfunctions. On at least three occasions, the explosive bolts meant to knock away the Soyuz service module haven’t done their job. As the online video shows, if the service module doesn’t separate cleanly, the descent module enters the atmosphere pointing the wrong way, depriving the crew of the protection of the heat shield as they torch their way through a fiery re-entry. Nobody’s burned up yet, although crews have been put through the terrifying, bone-crushing hellride of a “ballistic descent” that results when the Soyuz’s flight path is disrupted this way.

As a result, the cohort of young Mexicans who might want to head north for work has grown smaller.
