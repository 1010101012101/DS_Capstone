Rick Santorum, who is vying with Gingrich to emerge as the lone conservative alternative to Romney, has made the same argument about the risk of nominating a moderate. The former Pennsylvania senator is hoping that a strong showing in the Colorado caucuses -- and in contests that also occur Tuesday in Minnesota and Missouri -- will give his candidacy new credibility after a string of primary losses.

If you think that's bad, get this: Experts agree that the contracts are getting worse. "In the last decade, cruise lines have had to tighten the reins," says Bentz.

This type of product will cost $5 to $15 depending on the size of container you buy.

Take the case of Dana Frasz, a 27-year-old from Maine who is passionate about social change and is trying to start a food recovery organization in Oakland to help feed people.

The measure is the latest sweeping law to emerge from the 111th Congress. But the financial revamp, the 2009 stimulus act and this year's health-care overhaul—by any measure significant legislative achievements—haven't translated into support for the White House. Mr. Obama's approval ratings have sunk to some of their lowest levels in some polls amid a gloomy economic picture and rising doubts that his economic policies are working.
Things can make you happy. Jacques Guérin, a French perfume magnate, had a passion for Proust. He spent his life collecting manuscripts, clothing, furniture, letters — anything that the great author might have touched. His doctor, Robert Proust, was Marcel's brother, and he provided the collector with an inside track. When Proust's family began to throw away things that might reveal the writer's homosexuality and bohemian lifestyle, Guérin offered much-needed cash. The overcoat Proust wore when he wrote was the ultimate dream of a collector like Guérin. Too worn and fragile to be exhibited, the coat is in storage at the Musée Carnavalet in Paris. Bedroom furniture is also on display, including the brass bed covered in blue satin counterpane in which Proust wrote much of "In Search of Lost Time." Lorenza Foschini's portrait of Guérin and his Proust obsession is delightful, and the objects themselves take on a life of their own and do a jig in this little volume.

The evening starts with "Pink Knees on Pale Skin" by Ahonen, resident playwright for local company the Amoralists ("The Pied Pipers of the Lower East Side").

Over the same period (2010-2011), Shelley Duncan hit .246/.320/.451 (.771 OPS; 119 OPS+) while averaging 80 games per season. Slightly better offensively than Damon, but we’ll grade him down a bit for being leveraged as a part-time player.* Let’s say the two are—from a productivity standpoint—roughly similar hitters. While Damon has more OBP ability, Shelley’s advantage in power evens them out."
Last summer, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that a 1993 law allows students in unaccredited districts, such as St. Louis and Riverview Gardens, to transfer to districts in the same county or neighboring counties, with the home district paying tuition and transportation.

A recent report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said that four times as many Americans will lose their employer-sponsored health care than was originally thought. Maybe most scary, this report is already doubling the original projected cost of this mandate to $2.6 trillion from now until 2022, and is estimated to increase the federal deficit by $1.08 billion. These unreasonable mandates and enormous deficits will hurt our residents and create debt so high this country might never be able to recover.

Turnout and cost savings are the primary arguments for all-mail voting. Kelley notes in the study that there is a cost savings, but he offers no estimates. However, Kelley told me that much of the savings from not having to equip and staff polls is eaten up by printing and mailing costs for mail ballots. In 2009, he estimated the average statewide election cost the county $3.8 million to conduct, and would be reduced to $3.6 million with an all-mail approach.

At least Rachel Hauck’s detailed scenic design gives us something to daydream about — a weekend there would be fun — because little else commands attention. Like “We Live Here” and “Close Up Space,” the last two shows at Manhattan Theatre Club’s off-Broadway venue, Matt Charman’s “Regrets” is a half-baked play in an attractive package.

A: It's like everything has been put in my path, with God's grace. It's been totally life-changing. The advantage you have with being on the show is it takes away all the distractions of everyday life. People think it's all about these hard workouts, and that's part of it. But I have said this is about 10 percent physical and 90 percent mental. You don't have to worry about your family, your bills, you don't have to worry about anything but yourself while you're there. It opens up a whole new view of yourself. There's no one else to make excuses to. My dad always said you can lie to anyone you want, but you cannot lie to yourself. Going through this process has allowed me to get honest.

Politics is important, especially to those of us who spent most of our adult lives wading in it, particularly in a presidential election year.

President Bill Clinton awarded Sendak a National Medal of the Arts in 1996 and in 2009 President Obama read "Where the Wild Things Are" for the Easter Egg Roll.
Worldly sausage mavens familiar with French boudin noir, German blutwurst, Spanish morcilla and the like find Western's soondae a deliciously chewy revelation. Primarily sweet rice and clear potato-starch noodles, the ingredients are held together with a modicum of pork blood, spices and a bit of fat and barely deserves to be called blood sausage. Experienced soondae hands know to dip the sausage chunks into the chile-salt mixture or the briny saewoojeot, baby shrimp dipping sauce on the table.

But for all the bizarre goings-on that went on and on for so many years — with Martin and Jackson and Yogi Berra and Lou Piniella and all the managers and general managers and commissioners and league presidents and umpires, there was the other Steinbrenner. The Steinbrenner who quietly, without seeking any attention, put literally hundreds of underprivileged kids through college, who funded charities, who took care of down-on-their-luck acquaintances. He wanted to be the best he was at whatever he did, and he succeeded in more ways than many people knew.

Many online sites, such as those listed below, offer paper-bead-rolling instructions, but it comes down to simply cutting a long strip of paper - preferably wider at one end; rolling it around the rolling tool (from wider to narrower end); gluing it; allowing the glue to dry, and sealing the bead.
While much is said about the probability of Lance Berkman duplicating his 2011 revival, Craig and David Freese offer significant potential for large offensive gains. Craig's opportunities will be linked to how Mike Matheny uses Carlos Beltran. Does Beltran sit against LHP? Or does he play CF against LHP? Craig's per at-bat production is strong, as is Freese's. Freese enjoys a clear path to his first major league season of 100 games played. Craig's route will require more creativity.

•••• The biggest title dropping tomorrow is "Sydicate," a reboot of the nearly 20 year-old shooter, available on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. Just think, if the original "Syndicate" (which you possibly played on your Atari Jaguar), were a person, it could almost legally buy a beer! Needless to say, the new version looks nothing like its 1993 counterpart. If you are really into violence and mayhem, this game might be for you as it was simply not given a rating and banned in Australia.

I was able to slip out a side door, unlike the newly titled Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I wanted to visit my favorite part of the abbey: the cloisters and the garden.

When we did this last year, I felt pretty confident that the bracket would be one of the best I've ever picked. Okay, maybe not as good as my famous 2003 bracket where I had 14 of the Sweet 16 teams, seven of the final eight teams, three of the Final Four teams (still not over Kentucky losing to Marquette!) and picking Syracuse as the champion. But I felt last year had solid potential to be an all-timer.

The Key System was colorful -- its orange-and-silver electric trains rolling off the bridge and up through the neighborhoods of the East Bay. But the monument at Key Route Plaza, at Piedmont Station in Oakland, never lived up to it.

Republicans and Democrats agree that the law has failed for two primary reasons. First, its standards were set so high that they actually provide incentive for states to "dumb down" their own testing requirements to avoid running afoul of the law. And, second, No Child Left Behind gave the federal government sweeping powers to affect the futures of schools that fall below the standards, but it failed to provide the resources necessary to help those schools that weren't proficient enough.

Europeans set gasoline taxes high to discourage consumption, which reduces demand and thus, paradoxically, reduces prices. The price of oil is very sensitive to demand and the United States is a large consumer, so a small decrease here in consumption would lead to a large decrease in world prices. Using the revenue to lower other taxes by an equal amount would mean no net tax increase.

Warmer weather already is affecting agriculture. Cotton, traditionally a Southern crop, is moving north into Kansas. The Midwest corn-growing region has expanded north and west into South Dakota and North Dakota, and even into Manitoba, displacing less profitable crops such as wheat.

Case against: Tannehill, as gifted as he is, remains a project. He made just 19 college starts at quarterback after playing 31 games as receiver earlier in his career.

• Steve Gress, Corvallis Gazette-Times: Commentary: Fans should trust Riley with 1 more year to turn it around: If Riley keeps the staff together and they are able to take what the young players learned this season and mold them into even better players, and if the wins come - and come early - then many fans may step back away from the ledge. However, if there are no changes and the Beavers start slowly again and struggle to reach a bowl game, Riley's hands may be tied at this time next year. In fact, it may not even be Riley making the decision. Another season of the status quo and athletic director Bob De Carollis may have no choice but to find a successor for one of the nicest people in college athletics.

Evidently, most of us fall in the middle class, and our income has only increased by 40 percent since 1979, while the top 1 percent has increased by 300 percent. The top 1 percent of the wealth in our country includes anyone who makes $343,000 or more in a year, which puts me well down the list of the other 99 percent of the population. Yet, somehow, I'm OK with the 40 percent; and it doesn't matter to me that the 1 percent makes so much money.

Commissioner Stern said the issue will be reviewed in the offseason, but his cursory argument is weak. If the three ACLs this season compared to five last season is the best he can muster in defense of the compressed schedule, he might as well give it up and go straight to the mea culpa, because that won't cut it.

Here’s the catch: He refuses to overstate it — destroying Dallas only means the Giants earned the right to play on and gather momentum toward the ultimate goal, he said.

The "international style" of red wine -- big body, bright fruit, strong vanilla notes from new oak and soft tannins -- is perfect for enjoying without food at a party.

This election will be about the economy and prospects for job growth, analysts say. The GOP and the Chamber of Commerce and its allies say Brown is bad for job growth.
To hear Fey tell it, that scar is the only out-of-the-ordinary thing about her. In her self-portrait, Fey is the most normal of women, the product of a happy suburban family, a comfortably married wife and mother, and so hard-working she and the "30 Rock" writers pull all-nighters interrupted by Fey excusing herself occasionally "to change a diaper in the night. Usually for the baby."
Meanwhile, a legal battle is brewing in state courts over the animal-rights protest at the check station in Franklin Borough, where the Animal Protection League of New Jersey and the Bear Education and Resource group are still legally bound to organize at a site along Route 23.

Earlier this week, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster announced plans to appeal McElwain's ruling last week that overturned the jury's murder verdict. The ruling went on to say that Helmig was the innocent victim of a miscarriage of justice due to a combination of prosecutorial zeal, false evidence and poor representation at trial in 1996. Koster indicated that he was not taking sides but seeking another layer of review.

Los Angeles and San Jose are probably the two teams I would stay away from. While the Kings struggled early on they have regrouped under Darryl Sutter and bring a pretty impressive roster. They don't score a ton but like the Blues they keep the puck out of the net. The Sharks haven't had their best season but they bring tons of playoff experience having gone to the Western Conference finals the last two years. I certainly wouldn't volunteer to play San Jose in the opening round.

OBAMA: "Number one, we inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit.... That wasn't me. Number two, there is almost uniform consensus among economists that in the middle of the biggest crisis, financial crisis, since the Great Depression, we had to take extraordinary steps. So you've got a lot of Republican economists who agree that we had to do a stimulus package and we had to do something about the banks. Those are one-time charges, and they're big, and they'll make our deficits go up over the next two years." -- in Missouri.

Whether located at the Metropolitan Transit System bus yard site or on the waterfront, a downtown stadium should be an economic generator year-round.

The district, with about 39,000 students, has been under state control since 1995. Christie will give Booker a larger role in running the schools, and the mayor will also get a say in picking a new superintendent. Almost half of all students in the district don’t graduate from high school.
When voters ousted Ortega's Sandinista government in 1990, Borge's power waned and he became a congressman. Even Ortega's return to office in 2007 did little to help his political fortunes. After clashing with Murillo, the party's elder statesman was relegated to the post of ambassador to Peru.
A secondary romance blossoms between Gossett's avuncular Sam, a doctor overwhelmed with delivering babies, and Delia (Leilani Rosine Drakeford), the neighbor across the hall. Stiff, virginal and shy at first, but loosening up nicely, Delia is crusading for Harlem to have a family planning clinic, a clever plot device that allows Cleage to weave in material about Margaret Sanger, birth control and the early career of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. - as well as neighborhood resistance to birth control as a white plot to reduce the black population.

Mergers can be good or bad for the companies, their workers and the public. The merger of United and Continental, effective Oct. 1, arguably left the combined airline in a better position to compete, thanks to cost-saving efficiencies. It certainly helped Chicago, where United Continental Holdings located its headquarters. Delta and Northwest completed their merger in 2008, and that combination begat a strong competitor. Southwest is expected to fully integrate its acquisition of AirTran by 2014.

Clearing away the clutter gives rise to new ways of understanding how situations occur to people. For example, look at congregations that have ceased to be effective in their ministry. They are not growing-in fact, they are cluttered. Perhaps not cluttered with books and stacks of paper (though I have seen some that are), but cluttered instead by ideas of how things used to be, cluttered by ideas that no longer work, cluttered with grief over the loss of members. Their default future is dim indeed.

On March 16, our son, Ryan Alley, had a very serious automobile accident that resulted in his death (“TCNJ student Ryan Alley, 25, dies from injuries in Ewing car crash,” March 24). Questions remain unanswered, and some answers we will never know. Was he out that evening in a “safe and organized” environment, to prevent just this type of tragedy? Was it just a “bad decision” while trying to be a good friend and not letting his friend drive? Was he impaired to the point that he was unable to make “a conscious decision”?
