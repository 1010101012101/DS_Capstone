The two days of high-profile activity by Obama's top economic advisers underscore the tension the president confronts as he tries to steer the recovering but still shaky economy toward a new era of growth. On one hand the country needs a bounty of new jobs to make up for the 8 million jobs lost since the recession began 22 months ago. Given the growth in the working-age population, economists say it would take 10.7 million new jobs to return unemployment rates to prerecession levels.

The return of trailer-trash terror began quietly, probably with Rob Zombie’s surprise hit “House of 1000 Corpses” in 2003. Zombie followed it with the sequel “The Devil’s Rejects,” and then a reboot of John Carpenter’s “Halloween” series. While the stories changed, his interests were constant — sleazy sex, sweaty perverts, short skirts and cornpone crazies itching for the apocalypse.

The Quran also mentions who will enter hell. Disbelievers in God and especially if they die in that state, hypocrites, idolaters, the arrogant, those who treat religion as a pastime, have broken the treaty, made fun of God's messengers or reality of Day of Judgment.

The film "Bad Ass" is based on a February 2010 viral video that came to be known as "Epic Beard Man" in which an older white man got into a fist fight with a younger African American man on an Oakland bus over a misunderstanding that may have had racial overtones.

But even small jobs put Barnes in close proximity to the cops.
Yet Montclair is not considered a legendary rock city in the way that other Jersey municipalities like Hoboken, Asbury Park and New Brunswick are. The age of many of the rock musicians involved in the movement causes cognitive dissonance for outsiders. A typical rock scene consists of young musicians in their teens and 20s: artists with the time and energy to devote to the difficult organizational work that serious partying calls for. Many of the musicians in Montclair bands, though, have teenagers and 20-somethings of their own.
Hammond said the county's stagnant revenues due to the recession are a bigger concern.
Lubbock police Sgt. Jonathan Stewart said Tuesday that the owner of Fantasy Maid Service doesn't have a permit to operate a sexually oriented business. A violation brings a $2,000 fine.

The second half of "Imagine" is devoted to looking at "group creativity," examining what sort of collaborative dynamics (within businesses or communities) tend to maximize innovation. Studies of Broadway musicals by Brian Uzzi, a sociologist at Northwestern University, Lehrer says, showed that relationships among collaborators were one of the most important factors in the success of a show. If team members had too little previous experience working with one another, they struggled to communicate and exchange ideas. But if they were too familiar with one another, fresh ideas tended to be stifled.

It used be that the Japanese offered idiosyncratic takes on foreign things. White bread was transformed into shokupan, a Platonic ideal of fluffiness, aerated and feather-light in a way that made Wonder Bread seem dense. Pasta was almost always spaghetti, perfectly cooked al dente, but typically doused with cream sauce and often served with spicy codfish roe. Foreign imports here took on a life of their own, becoming something completely different and utterly Japanese.

The answer to this question continues to evolve. Several current guidelines suggest that men with a 10-year life expectancy should have an informed discussion of the benefits and risks of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, screening. If men do decide to be screened earlier, age 40 is the time to assess individual risk. If the risk is high — i.e., if there's family history or the person is of African-American race — annual screening is recommended. If the risk is average, the next screening is recommended at age 45, and then, if it has remained average, annual screening should begin at age 50. PSA testing should certainly continue to be used for monitoring patients with prostate cancer after treatment, when it's necessary to monitor disease progression.
The stymied Serb smashed his racket, scolded himself and threw up his hands in surrender. He won four games in that first set but never once looked comfortable. Never once looked like the man who handled Roger Federer just two nights before.

Others, like Newman, have a third form, the Do Not Resuscitate directive. It's better than nothing, but the POLST has largely replaced it.

"Americans have this long sense of isolation and impregnability and 9/11 was the end of the blind American sense they had won the Cold War," says Jonathan Galassi, president and publisher of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, which just released Amy Waldman's "The Submission," a novel about a Pakistani-American winning a contest for designing a Sept. 11-like memorial. "And all of a sudden we had different kinds of enemies, different kinds of problems that were worse in a way, much worse."

Romney has company in this weakness. Rick Santorum declined to correct a woman who said at one of his campaign events that Obama is an "avowed Muslim." But Santorum was a protest candidate; Romney, barring catastrophe, will be the Republican nominee. Romney's aides correctly point out that he isn't responsible for everything his supporters say, but Romney himself invited this standard when he called on one of his primary rivals, Rick Perry, to disavow an introductory speaker who had called Mormonism a "cult."

Evanston's Next Theatre Company, which specializes in "socially provocative" plays, has done unusually well by "After the Revolution," which was first seen in 2010 at Massachusetts's Williamstown Theatre Festival and has since been produced off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons. This staging, finely directed by Kimberly Senior, features a letter-perfect performance by Christine Stulik as Emma Joseph, the starchily self-righteous young political activist who is jolted to the marrow when she learns the ugly truth about her grandfather. Keith Pitts, one of Chicago's best set designers, has given the Josephs an apartment whose décor stealthily suggests that their Marxism is built on a comfortable foundation of family money.

It was for this third match, on Oct. 1, 1975, in Quezon City, the Philippines, that Ali predicted he would have an easy time with Frazier. In the pre-fight promotions for what was dubbed the "Thrilla in Manila," Ali called Frazier an "Uncle Tom" and a "gorilla" and repeatedly ridiculed him. The fight was anything but easy, and Ali later likened it to being "the closest thing to dying." By the 14th round, both having hit and been hit too many times to count, Frazier's eyes were nearly swollen shut and he couldn't see Ali's punches, even though he had stood in and flailed away for several rounds right through his near-blindness.

My pizza memory goes back 53 years. I went to the Bronx, N.Y., to spend Easter with my boyfriend and his family. One night, he took me out to Patsy's for pizza. "What's pizza?" I asked. He replied, "Don't worry, you'll like it." He ordered, and soon two immensely extra-large pizzas were brought to us. They were huge! "Whose are those?" I asked. "One for you, and one for me," he replied. Whereupon he picked up the first piece, folded it and ate it. Then I tried to do the same. I did finish one piece of my pizza but it was too much to eat. He finished his pizza and finished mine. We have been married 56 years now, and we have pizza many times during the year. One difference -- it is of the more conventional size: large. Not enormous. -- Betty Ficke, Middlefield

Strategists are divided on whether registrations will rise to their previous levels. But the prospect of a tight race between Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, has placed great importance on getting eligible Americans to register and vote.

On the other hand, we've seen costs skyrocket. Nobody is happy: physicians don't like it, patients don't like it. Why? Because none of them are responsible for themselves. You no longer have a situation in which a patient chooses a physician, receives a service, gets charged and pays for it. There is no direct relation between the patient and the physician. The physician is an employee of an insurance company or an employee of the government. Today, a third party pays the bills.

"I used to do this big bug eye thing when a scene really meant something. I've learned, I hope, to take that out of my work," she says. "An actor who feels insecure, or uncomfortable, about watching themselves is missing out on a wealth of information."
Mix all that together and we end up with paralysis. There's a reason why most of the common-sense discussion around federal spending comes from people who are out of office and no longer beholden to a party brand.
The surgeon's connections in Maryland have already brought about a new relationship for Cleveland Clinic Innovations: Last week, the department partnered with MedStar Health, a nine-hospital system that serves the Maryland and Washington, D.C., region, to develop the ideas of that system's physicians.

BOULDER — Kailey Edwards said it was surreal.
Wisniewski has led an unusual MMA career. He fought in the UFC before the company took off in popularity, but then his career fell off significantly with a long series of losses. Wisniewski rebounded with a number of wins that earned him a return to the UFC after a six year absence. Clements is a Canadian striker who has never fought to a decision and is making his UFC debut.

A top-down plan is being forced on us: the "vision" of "sustainability"--the collapsing of our cities' unique characters into an oppressive uniformity that will decimate our quality of life. Ever hear of ICLEI -- the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives? Menlo Park is a dues paying member. So are Palo Alto, Mountain View, Burlingame, etc. ICLEI is driving this "sustainability" agenda and we are all paying the price in the "wrenching transformation" of our cities (See FreedomAdvocates.org).

At another end of the spectrum, recent-vintage heartthrob Luke Bryan, fresh out of the gate with his debut album when he first played Stagecoach in 2008, moved up the bill and may well be headlining himself in another couple of years if he keeps churning out hits the way he has with his first three albums. He made female fans swoon and male audience members pump their fists in solidarity with his mix of hyper-romantic ballads ("Do I") and wryly humor-filled party tunes ("All My Friends Say").

Exquisite film about a female rock 'n' roll duo who reunite years after a professional and personal falling out. Back in the day, they partied as hard as they rocked. Now one of them works in TV in Los Angeles, the other is doing acoustic music. The filmmaking and writing are as assured as the performances. McDonald strays just a bit with a couple of externalized scenes of inner turmoil, but otherwise, his aim is true.

And because the law establishing the June primary does not take effect until next month, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has urged all prospective candidates to follow the existing rules, which are based on a March primary.

It’s worth noting our enemies get a say in when and where the next fight comes — and war is a come-as-you-are affair. Yes, a strategy of “nimble” and “flexible” is attractive, but there’s a certain quality in quantity even in today’s high-tech “battlespace.”
“Don’t ask me about my moves. ... I’m not gonna give you that type of information,” he said.

Private companies should be allowed to explore and develop domestic energy resources without undo interference or assistance. The Solyndra scandal and the lackluster jobs numbers posted by other federally backed "green jobs" initiatives illustrate the government's inability to engineer a solution to the country's employment crisis. Opening new domestic frontiers for traditional energy production would generate the jobs that other politically popular programs have manifestly failed to produce.

øIf you think that inflation is going to rise sharply, TIPS will likely fare better than regular Treasury bonds. And if you buy TIPS from the Treasury and hold them to maturity, you won't lose money. Even so, with rates so low, the big mystery will be how you'll make much money with TIPS.

Kill wants his players to head home and get to bed immediately afterward, because Saturday's wake-up comes early. The Gophers, who have been asked to dress up "to show what Gary meant to you," are due at a team breakfast at 4:30 a.m. the next morning.

The turning point, however, came in the form of two new recruits.
"You aren't my best friend anymore!" he said as he bent down, "picked" up the "ball" and "threw" it to his brother before stomping off into the car. Little Bits "watched" the "ball" go over his head and turned to run to where it "landed," "picked" it up and brought it back to us, now happy enough to stop crying. My wife and I got all the kids into the car and stopped before getting in to look at one another.

Q: Denver has veterans Ty Warren, Kevin Vickerson and Justin Bannan at defensive tackle. Is that enough talent there? Or do the Broncos need to draft a defensive tackle in the first round?
A number one album by Central California combo Cake is not a sign of the apocalypse. It is, however, further evidence that the music industry is in serious trouble. This January, "Showroom of Compassion" became the lowest-selling set ever to top the Billboard 200, which seems fitting for a band as sardonic as Cake. Vocalist Jon McCrea -- he sometimes raps, and sometimes sings, but never gets too excited no matter what he does -- might be the most cynical person in contemporary rock. "Every shiny toy/ that at first brings you joy/ will soon begin to cloy and annoy," goes "Sick of You," and that's a pretty fair approximation of McCrea's worldview. Luckily, he's also very funny, and often weirdly trenchant. When he intones "my plastic utensil has broken in half," on "Bound Away," he makes it feel like all the entropy in the universe has descended on his lunch.

A practical mirror exercise keeps the person from zooming in to focus on the body part causing concern — big ears, say — by instead standing in front of the mirror and describing herself from top to bottom in very objective, nonjudgmental terms: "I'm 5 feet 8, my hair is brown, my eyes are green."

With their backs against the Staples Center glass, the Canucks put together their best effort of the series, coolly overcoming a second-period deficit with three straight goals to back Schneider, who outplayed dominant All-Star goalie Jonathan Quick.

He was given a post approving scripts for government-run theaters and movie houses. He had no car and rented a house for his family. He wasn't poor, but he was far from comfortable by Western standards, his family recalled.
And Oregon is right. Most writing is done on computers now and spell check is indeed ubiquitous. (Case in point, my computer just told me I spelled "ubiquitous" wrong on the first and second tries. Thanks, computer.) Few states insist on perfect spelling on their standardized writing tests. Many states, including Washington, ask students to submit "first-draft writing" and assume those writing samples will include some spelling errors.
It went from looking like a dungeon to a CVS pharmacy, Gilles said.
Williams surgery set: The Blazers made official what Williams told The Oregonian Tuesday night -- he will have surgery on his left shoulder and miss the remainder of the season.

They owned season tickets last year, but the PSLs and troubling economy priced them out. Now, they go on a game-by-game basis. And always five hours before kickoff. They cook burgers, hot dogs and sausages. They raise an American flag and a Jets flag. The four Jets fans make fun of the one Giants fan in the group.

It's a trait others point out as well. "He's very enthusiastic," says Arthur Wayne, vice president of global public relations for Brooks Brothers, who first met Goreski while the latter was still in Zoe's employ.

Discount tee times, course closings and a challenging economy are making it tough for traditional private clubs, so some are reinventing themselves for a new market. There's no better example than the Clubs of Kingwood, which is in the midst of a multimillion dollar "reinvention," on schedule to be completed this summer.
Appetizers work smoothly into the steakhouse excess theme. If shrimp cocktail is the traditional opener, this version shows why: Fat, sweet crustaceans arrive with a punchy sauce. Seared scallops are crusty outside and silky within, and a handful of crabmeat enlivens an already rich potato-leek soup. On the other hand, a sizable portion of crabmeat cocktail seemed to bear a faintly oxidized sharpness.

Background: Originally released in 1971, the "Electric Warrior" album featured signature T. Rex songs "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" and "Jeepster." The cover art depicted T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan (1947-1977) playing guitar in front of a monolithic amplifier stack. "Electric Warrior" was an 11-song release, so to make the math work for six 7-inch records, this Record Store Day reissue adds a B-side titled "Raw Ramp." The six sleeves can be assembled to make a larger image of Bolan.

More important, Burton owes the public his trust in today's rightfully elected officials to give this issue a fair public airing, free from backroom threats to use his position as leader of California's most powerful political party to damage their political careers.

Miesville's community magnet is Jack Ruhr Field on the western edge of town, home to the Miesville Mudhens, always a strong contender in the Cannon Valley Classic League of amateur baseball. Minnesota's townball popularity is the envy of many states, and a Mudhens game on a warm summer night offers sublime reasons why. Hand-painted signboards promoting local merchants form the outfield fence, and just beyond them is an actual cornfield planted by the farmer who donated the ballfield's land.
54 percent: The estimated amount of all aluminum cans in the United States that were recycled in 2008. This was an increase for the second straight year. However, it is down from 63 percent in 1998.
As we know, the first two games of the Western Conference semifinals haven't gone well; not much of anything has gone right. The Blues lost two at home to the Los Angeles Kings getting outscored 8-2 after scoring the first goal of the series. The Kings' stunning wipeout of the Blues in Game 2 looked like a demolition. It left the Blues angry and embarrassed, and left their fans feeling shocked and sad.

If you're stuck in a situation like this again, politely ask the Expedia representative to escalate the call. You can do that by calmly asking to speak with that person's direct supervisor - not "a supervisor" or 'someone in charge" since that can be interpreted in many ways and could land you with an agent's colleague who will proceed to tell you it can't be done.
SuperPAC influence While Obama and Romney both will spend huge amounts of money in the coming months, an untold additional amount will come from outside organizations called super PACs that can collect unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and individuals.
For most, it probably happened early. Somewhere along the arc of childhood, many anti-everything crusaders were stabbed in the heart with a very narrow idea of how life, love and sexuality are supposed to look, feel, move. And if, by adulthood, they fail to feel that way -- and more importantly, if one's own desires, deepest longings, spiritual aches somehow fail to line up with that bogus image (as they almost always do) -- well, someone's gotta pay.

"It was a difficult decision, but what I need to do right now is focus all my attention on talking to people about what's really important -- creating jobs and growing our economy," Inslee said in a statement.
Lucas was known as "The Enforcer." Nobody ever called him "forward" without using the word "power" before it. And those Blazers teams –– they were plain nasty. They were physical. They were no fun to play against. Late in games, they closed things out. Not because they were always more talented, but because they played with a crisp desperation, and they turned the game into a back-alley whipping.

The situation in Prichard is extremely unusual - the city has sought bankruptcy protection twice - but it proves that the unthinkable can, in fact, sometimes happen. And it stands as a warning to cities like Philadelphia and states like Illinois, whose pension funds are under great strain: If nothing changes, the money eventually does run out, and when that happens, misery and turmoil follow.

18) True, we love air-conditioned comfort, but Kansas Citians also love spending warm evenings under the stars at Starlight Theatre.

"The U.S. has to create 150,000 every month in the private sector just to stabilize the rate and prevent it from rising," he said. "We'd have to create 300,000 jobs every month for the next three years just to bring back the level of employment to before this recession started," Roubini said.

Holland has enough cap room (perhaps $20 million) and a strong enough core to position the Wings for contention in 2013. But his more important task is finding stars for 2016 and beyond. When the 2016 playoffs start, Pavel Datsyuk will be 37, Henrik Zetterberg will be 35, Johan Franzen will be 37, and Lidstrom surely will be long gone. The Wings need to find their next stars before they need to find their next stars.
All countries that commit to the new EU treaty cannot allow their annual deficits to exceed 0.5 percent of economic output in normal times.

Kulongoski introduced the bill after signing a dam removal deal with California, the federal government and PacifiCorp.

We stopped for lunch on an estancia where, as a vegetarian, I declined to eat chunks of llama. We loaded back up and ventured to the Salinas Grandes, the largest salt flats in the country.

The purpose of fair use was to allow use of works when transactions were impractical. In that spirit we should acknowledge that if you use someone's song in a basement skit that never leaves your basement, that should be fair use.

Mali's new military junta, led by Capt. Amadou Sanogo, may have hoped the coup would win support in the region: It appealed to neighboring countries to send troops to defeat the rebels. Instead the economic community's leaders said they were willing to send 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers to try to crush the northern rebellion — once the junta stepped aside.

At my house, black beans are a favorite source of protein, so they are a natural addition to pasta salads with Mexican inspirations. You can use any shape of noodle for pasta salads, like bow ties (farfalle) or wagon wheels (rotelle), and widely available Barilla brand makes minishells, penne and other shapes that work well. But for a salad with black beans, I like to use orecchiette, which have a central depression where beans and sauce tend to well up, making for delicious forkfuls.

Nonetheless, these large-scale factors swamp the question of marginal training cost. In the early 1990s, as we thought through the implications of "don't ask, don't tell," I worked out the numbers for the Air Force. During the previous decade, we'd put about 800,000 people through basic and advanced training programs, at a cost of about $30 billion. The money we expended on training 3,000 people who eventually were removed on account of homosexuality was minuscule by comparison. (During the same decade, we forced out 15 times as many people for failure to meet Air Force weight standards, with no one objecting to the cost.)
How costly? Well, we start with the staff, which includes a chief of staff, a program analyst, a senior program analyst, two assistants and personal aide. Those six salaries alone cost $320,000, plus benefits.

Mr. Obama is also touting spending cuts he's willing to make in entitlements in return for bigger tax increases, yet the spending increases built into ObamaCare aren't even up for discussion in the debt-limit talks. The Affordable Care Act adds more than 30 million more Americans onto Medicaid's rolls, when that program is already growing by 6.5% this year. So Mr. Obama is willing to cut current entitlements on grounds that they are unaffordable, but he's taken what may be the most expensive entitlement off the table.

The answer: I came out of college and I was a claims adjuster and I learned how to negotiate and learned some things about construction. I was kind of miserable at that. A friend of mine who was also a claims adjuster left and went to work for an oil and gas company, and one day he says, "You'd be a good land man." A land man goes out and leases land from Farmer Brown to do oil and gas leases. I started doing oil and gas leasing out in rural areas, and this was back before all the county records were computerized and you had to go down to the musty grantee-grantor indexes and flip through old tax maps. I kind of fell in love with the business.
Though that follows a nationwide trend of declining crime — and Baltimore remains one of the deadliest cities in America — city officials and crime experts credit Bealefeld's strategy of focusing on guns and repeat offenders with driving the reductions here. Despite high-profile incidents of violence at the Inner Harbor during Fourth of July festivities, crime this year is up but still tracking closely with last year's lows.
You can actually drive around. At many Caribbean and Mexican resorts, tourists are warned not to leave their resorts or drive.

That gives you more freedom.

Compared to his contemporaries, DiMaggio and Williams, a couple of California native sons who did not exactly radiate much warmth, Musial was an equal on the field and a sweeter human being. He is in his 90s now with an apparent touch of Alzheimer's, so there was no opportunity for Vecsey to sit and chat with a gentleman who once loved to do just that. What a pity this book wasn't begun sooner. We mustn't forget any man who made it all the way around the horn from good to great to god.

At Picketwire Canyonlands on the Comanche National Grasslands south of La Junta, walk an interpretive trail that includes more than 1,300 tracks. That's not the only place in the state where they left a big impression. Several museums and trails near Grand Junction allow you to view bones and tracks in situ. At Dinosaur Ridge in Morrison, tracks, bones and other fossils are etched in stone along the "dinosaur highway."

Instead of vampires, the main characters are witches. In place of Manhattan, the action unfolds in North Hampton, Long Island, a town that "does not exist on any map, which made locating the small, insular community on the very edge of the Atlantic coast something of a conundrum to outsiders, who were known to wander in by chance only to find it impossible to return; so that the place, with its remarkably empty silver-sand beaches, rolling green fields, and imposing, rambling farmhouses, became more of a half-remembered dream than a memory. Like Brigadoon, it was shrouded in fog and rarely came into view."

The former Laker is back home with an improved lineup led by rookie Kyrie Irving who's coming off a 26-point performance. The Cavaliers (5-5) did not practice this morning, hoping to conserve as much energy before flying home on Saturday. This is their second shot at back-to-backs this season.

Roosevelt Tavern is a converted 1920s-era cottage that once housed an architectural firm. Now, it's a rustic, super-dark, unassuming destination for draft beers, wine and artisanal takes on bar food.
