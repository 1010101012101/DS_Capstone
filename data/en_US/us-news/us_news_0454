Already Mayor Greg Ballard's office and City-County Council President Maggie Lewis have split on how quickly to spend the additional $41 million that the city and county will now get from the state. The windfall justifies a robust debate about how soon, and where, to plug the money into painfully tight budgets, especially for public safety. But the city needs to be cautious that it doesn't build a fiscal cliff into a future budget by pumping too much one-time money into its current spending plan.

Lack of ability to adapt and learn is one of the reasons our country is at risk of being surpassed by others in regard to technological innovations. It is all of our collective responsibility to teach others how to best integrate new technological advances into our lives. Dot-com isn't the only way to participate in society, but it helps those (especially seniors) with limited mobility and social interaction to stay relevant. You are the choices you make; watching cable TV doesn't give an accurate world view, and I'm deeply saddened that you who are so much older and supposedly wiser than me are taking no steps to inform yourselves, but rather you seem content to let corporations dictate on how they view the world. Don't believe the hype you see on Fox News, 'Lost Generation,' and don't blame your ignorance on a youth that strives to make the world a better place using just these technologies you speak so poorly of."

They have the best roster depth in the league. They won a lot of games without Rose this season, thanks to players who knew their roles and saw a greater good beyond individual accomplishments. That's why Saturday was so frustrating, why Sunday wasn't so hot and why Monday figures to be a bummer, too. The Bulls were going to win Game 1 regardless of whether Rose was on the court for the last 80 seconds. There was too much talent available to let the 76ers come back.

I think you have to take everything into account, but pro potential certainly outweighs college production. There have been many highly productive college players who haven't been worth a lick in the NFL. But if a player has not been productive in college and you think he has NFL talent, you have to have a good answer as to why he did not produce more. Projecting what any player can do at the next level is the key to good drafting. But it often is done incorrectly, because it isn't easy.

Pritchard got too powerful for the liking of those running the team in Portland and at Allen's Vulcan Inc. mothership. He got too much attention. He got too much adoration. Too many people heard "Pritch-Slapped!" and "In KP We Trust" too many times. And even though he had a shaky free-agent summer in 2009, given that Pritchard's deep roster saved the 2009-2010 season from being derailed by injuries, he should not be left to doubt his job security.
Florbetapir is awaiting approval at the Food and Drug Administration.

She is down to earth and so supportive of me. That is what's important.

The engine is an evolution of Subaru's flat-four boxer (code-named the FA), with Toyota-sourced direct-injection heads. Subaru says the car's center of gravity is a mere 18 inches off the ground, comparable to that of a Porsche Cayman R. And, since this is a rear-drive car, the engine could be situated well back in the chassis, more than 9 inches aft of where it would be in the all-wheel-drive Impreza. The low CG and the centralized engine placement give the BRZ an intuitive sense of mechanical leverage over the road. This thing feels like it rotates precisely around the driver's right hip.

Repeat violator status: Because Ohio State had a major violation with basketball coach Jim O'Brien providing $6,000 to a recruit and quarterback Troy Smith receiving $500 from a booster that was handed down on March, 10, 2006, the NCAA warned that Ohio State could be seen as a repeat violator, which could lead to harsher sanctions. Those specifically spelled out in the NCAA Manual include loss of scholarships or postseason bans that could apply to bowls or the Big Ten championship game. However, more severe penalties are not automatic, and Buckner believes, based on the Notice of Allegations, that the repeat violator status may not be an issue.

Portland writer Kent Hartman's "The Wrecking Crew: The Inside Story of Rock and Roll's Best-Kept Secret" is full of entertaining stories from the studio. Blaine is a raconteur with tremendous recall, and Hartman wisely concentrates his narrative on Blaine and two other key figures: Carol Kaye, a brilliant bass player and guitarist and the only woman in the Wrecking Crew, and Glen Campbell, who went from Wrecking Crew guitarist to superstar. Their stories might not be rock and roll's best-kept secret, but they are a fascinating part of modern music history, when dominant producers such as Spector and Brian Wilson gave way to changing technology and attitudes about the use of studio musicians. The music biz maxim -- if you haven't heard of the Wrecking Crew, you've heard them -- surely applies to Blaine and Kaye. Blaine played with Elvis Presley and John Lennon and the Partridge Family and the Captain & Tennille. If the gig paid, he played. He had a rubber stamp with "Hal Blaine Strikes Again!!" on it that he used on his drum charts and on the wall of every studio in town. His drum sound on the Spector-produced "Be My Baby" is so big that Max Weinberg, Bruce Springsteen's drummer, wrote that if it was the only song Blaine played on, "his name would still be uttered with reverence and respect."

Ukulele fail, take two: Hawaii failed for a second time to set a record for the largest ukulele ensemble. The effort April 28 drew more than 1,000 people to Honolulu to capture the Guinness World Record. But the headcount fell about 250 musicians short of the 1,547 players needed. It was the second time since last summer that an attempt at the record didn't work out. Hawaii News Now reported that the group gathered at the Blaisdell Center arena had fun anyway, playing a song by local ukulele revival hero Jake Shimabukuro. The only thing odder than the failure is who holds the record: Sweden, set in August.

Are we finished? Nowhere near. At most, these crowd pleasers would make noticeable dents. Recall that the deficits total almost $10 trillion over the next decade under President Barack Obama's original 2012 budget. That's the point: Even discounting the effects of the deep recession, prospective deficits are so large that they can't be cured by tinkering. We should be asking basic questions:
The perception is that the 75-year-old SEC can barely keep up with fast-changing markets and trading developments.

The irony is that the two are actually quite similar. Both are establishment candidates known for playing it safe and catching grief from extreme members of their party.

"I do think that any time you're talking about a league that has gotten multiple bids on a very consistent basis, that means there's a lot of good teams, and that means you're not held to a perfect standard throughout the season," Stevens said.

courageous judge of young talent - in any sport - who dares to predict success for a player because of qualities that can't be quantified. And the fact is that nobody - nobody in basketball - had the perception or the guts to say: you know, I don't care what anybody else thinks, this kid Jeremy Lin has it. It - whatever that is. It's not, either, like he was tucked away in Bulgaria. Lin was hidden in plain sight. He led his high school at Palo Alto to the California championship. No, Harvard is not Kentucky or North Carolina, but he was on display for four years in Division I. Come on. But none of the geniuses - not one scout, one coach, one general manager - could see what everyone sees now when it's fashionable. None of the people paid to envision, could envision. Obviously, some of it was simply that Lin wasn't the right heritage. No, I'm not saying basketball people are prejudiced against Asian-Americans. It's simply the usual common stupidity of stereotyping. It wasn't just a matter of race. Scouts tend to be uncomfortable with anything different."

When Nguyen Tran emailed to tell me about an extravaganza he was setting up at an acquaintance's house, a special herb dinner in which each of the many courses would involve fresh marijuana, I did not necessarily beg to be included in the feast.

But the notion of an “herb” dinner wasn't especially my thing. The last time I had sampled this particular herb was many years ago, in the course of reporting a story on Snoop Dogg and his 15 pit bulls, and its culinary uses were not apparent even back then.

The patriarch of the family is doing it his way with the Teuflesberg colt purchased entirely by chance for $21,000 at a Florida auction.
* Manning and Miami makes a lot of sense for several reasons: (1) owner Steve Ross will likely make a preposterous financial offer to Manning; (2) the Dolphins offer the warmth of the sun; cold weather isn't an issue; (3) it's an AFC team, which keeps Manning in relatively familiar company; (4) Manning would get to go against rival Tom Brady twice a season; (5) Manning already owns a condo in Miami; (6) the Dolphins have a sturdy offensive line, led by OT Jake Long, that can protect Manning; (7) the Dolphins have a nice array of playmakers including WR Brandon Marshall, RB Reggie Bush, TE Anthony Fasano and WR Brian Hartline; (8) the Dolphins hired an offense-oriented head coach in Joe Philbin, who presumably would let Manning be Manning.
The email survey showed Connally had the votes to switch meeting times from 6 p.m. to 3 p.m. The council president then sought fast-track approval of the measure on Tuesday, but postponed the vote during the meeting.

Twice the Rockies have had a chance to win a deciding game. Both times, their defense betrayed them. Jordan Pacheco threw wildly in Houston on Sunday as a 2-1 lead fizzled into a 3-2 loss. And Fowler's miscue gave the Giants room to exhale, leaving shaky closer Brian Wilson operating with a three-run cushion in the ninth instead of a one-run advantage.

But rather than leave bad enough alone, Obama and company clamp down, ever harder. Strengthening CAFE standards by 53.5 percent by 2025 likely will yield deadlier cars. Airbags will do only so much while surrounded by materials that recall aluminum siding.
Another storm was expected to dump as much as 18 inches of new snow on the Cascades overnight, keeping avalanche danger high.
“I thought I’d give him a different look,” said Manuel. “I don’t know if he has a different approach (in the leadoff spot), but sometimes in the third hole, you try too hard, especially to knock in runs. I’m not saying Jimmy did that, but I’m just trying to find the best way to balance the lineup and score some runs.”
I wasn't entirely sure that what I heard was apoplexy, but whatever it was, it had to be something close. Ziegler finally quit sputtering. "You don't understand," he said. "Obama can't be seen as doing anything right. It's got to be his fault that gas prices are high."
First off, they should clarify the agreement to underscore that The Thing They Can't Sell Elsewhere is the actual file generated by the app and not the content that you created for it. It appears that the license doesn't prevent the author from using the same material to build an ebook with another app, but that's not clear.
Storage closets, school officials said, have been split in half and are being used as spaces for various activities, including a speech therapy class and a guidance counselor's office.

Trackside seats: Youngstown horse owner Bruce Zoldan will have some special friends in his box seats at the Kentucky Derby on May 5, and they paid a healthy price to watch Zoldan's Went the Day Well as the stallion makes a Run for the Roses. At the recent Power Of Love Gala for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas, Zoldan was asked to donate some of his Kentucky Derby box seats for a special auction.

Owner Eddie Cerino is the grandson of Carrie Cerino, namesake of the venerable restaurant and party center in North Royalton. He said he learned the secret of the pizza crust -- a starter called poolish -- from a master breadmaker in Minnesota. The dough "brews" for three days, creating a higher sugar content than most.
The most interesting finding?
"It created a perception among people that maybe I didn’t care, which was a mistake to allow that perception to be created," he said. "I think the things we’ve done this year have shown people that I really do care and was trying to be a good father and a good husband."
"If people get into one-upping each other, that will just push everybody in our group to run faster," Rupp said. "That's a great thing for all of us. ... Chris ran a great race. He showed he has the ability to close, and that he is a 10k-runner. I've heard he says he just wants to run the 5k. He will be good wherever he goes.

In his previous start Wainwright found better feel for his signature curveball. In Tuesday's start he found more consistent command of his fastball. If he shied from contact in his earlier starts, Wainwright said he again embraces a more aggressive approach where quick results are more desirable than strikeouts.
The Optima Hybrid is not a perfect car, to be sure. The powertrain software is strangely moody at times. The trunk is a little tight. It's about as exhilarating as a bolus of laudanum, thus the "commuting" qualifier. It's just that it is otherwise such a staggering amount of car for the money. Kia's PR team thoughtfully equipped my test car with the Hybrid Premium Technology package ($5,350, for a total out-the-door price of $32,615), a hugely persuasive and Lexus-like list of upgrades including navigation with SiriusXM traffic info; rear-camera display; an excellent Infinity eight-speaker sound system with subwoofer; panoramic sunroof with blacked out B-pillars (those are the roof supports between the front and rear doors that, when blacked out, sleek-ify the car's profile); heated and ventilated front seats; and a heated steering wheel and rear seats.
GM's stock tumbled to the lowest price in the company's 100-year history, closing at just 75 cents after trading as low as 74 cents. The government plan for GM revealed Thursday would make the shares virtually worthless.

"People say that?" asked Farley, launching into a list of things she can't have while she's filming, "24/7": magazines, TV, cell phones ... No wonder they all hang out so much.
Brown demurred, but said, "It will be very interesting." In fact, "You'll hear howls of execration over the next 30 days," he told a gathering of Silicon Valley CEOs on Tuesday.

Dreaming of Florence, Italy? Step into Chinato on East Fourth Street in Cleveland, where one panoramic view of the city provides the passport. So does the food, in its own way. Chef-owner Zack Bruell knows how to deeply dig culinary ethnicity, polish it and frame it for today's customer. He also knows how to make flavor accents sing. Consider the chicken legs saltimbocca, a boned, stuffed and lavishly sauced reconstruction so tender, it practically opens like a blossom. Or the wispily battered seafood fritto misto, full of elegance and caper-berry punch. Or the antipasto appetizer, a star-studded lineup of bright salad elements cured with lemon, balsamic vinegar, garlic and other Mediterranean cravings. With cheese and bread, it's a meal. Expect super-juicy salmon atop humble, lightly garlicked, velvety cannellini beans, a raw yellowtail tuna appetizer (a spectacular pairing with pesto), and the one-two punch of simply crisped walleye over a neatly fried, downy pillow of codfish and potato. The menu is much larger, but prices are not. Most entrees, served without a vegetable or salad, are under $20. Pastas are available in half-portions for under $10. At the end of it all, try the mounded ricotta cheesecake, a sweet and wholesome thing, or the chocolate and hazelnut minitorte, a layered and frosted celebration with a center crunch that could take you right to Perugia.

Here's a bit of news to be thankful for: By Thanksgiving next year, the liquid ban may be moot. The Transportation Security Administration announced this month that new, more sophisticated scanning equipment can distinguish between safe and unsafe liquids, rendering the carry-on liquid ban unnecessary.

Roger Boisjoly was an engineer at solid rocket booster manufacturer Morton Thiokol and had begun warning as early as 1985 that the joints in the boosters could fail in cold weather, leading to a catastrophic failure of the casing.

"I walk down Pennsylvania Avenue a lot," Kurz said, referring to the west-side street that has one of the city's most thriving drug trades. "I've been stopped and questioned, and rightly so. The officers have done it in very respectful ways. They explain why they stopped me and that they're going to ask me questions. I think they should do that."
Jason Cole at Yahoo! Sports didn't hand out grades. Rather, he identified draft-day winners and losers and pointed to Massie as a loser because he was projected as a player who "could possibly go in the first round after he worked diligently with former Pro Bowl offensive lineman LeCharles Bentley."

Today, in the waiting room at Monticello, which once held 28 chairs to accommodate the president's visitors, tour guides point out the ingenious seven-day clock, which Jefferson designed. It still functions, driven by two large, cannon ball-like weights that hang on both sides of the front door. The clock governed the time schedule in the house and plantation; it was attached to a Chinese gong that could be heard by slaves more than three miles away. Thanks to Levy, who spent a huge amount of money on the restoration and upkeep of Monticello, Jefferson's clock and other inventions and possessions are available today to tourists.

Those with lower levels of education, the data show, have fared much worse. The unemployment rate for those with at least a bachelor's degree remains at just 4 percent but rises dramatically for those with less education, hitting 15 percent for people lacking a high school diploma. Anecdotal evidence suggests that experienced workers and men have also been hit particularly hard.
He suffered a bruised knee during the opening minutes of the second half against Baylor, so you can bet the left knee of the 6-10 freshman will be the most talked about body part this week.

But when the teller told Perdomo the bank was closed and said she should come back the next day, Perdomo left the bank. She allegedly waited until Tuesday - and then returned to the bank.
When the prolonged agony officially ended Wednesday with the announcement of Manning's departure, surprise was hardly in play. The Colts could not afford a $28 million paycheck for a year, and the star could command premium dollars as a free agent. A new quarterback was in the wings, and a capped budget had to fill several holes in a suddenly losing team. One bad year had sent executives and coaches packing. The signs were clear.
The toppings, though, are anything but traditional. Specialty pizzas are topped with mozzarella, parmesan, asiago, romano and fresh basil, but from there things get complex. The Ribeye is a 16-inch crust layered with thin sliced ribeye steak, white garlic sauce, mushrooms, peppers, garlic and onions. It's a full meal for several people. The "Mateo" heaps on fresh veggies -- artichoke hearts, asparagus, greens, mushrooms and more -- which can weigh down the crispy crust. A simple pepperoni, black olive and basil pizza proves most rewarding, a perfect ratio of topping to crust. The pies aren't cheap, at $22 to $25, and there are only a couple of tables, so the best options are to order to go or grab a slice at lunch. Gluten-free crusts and dairy-free cheeses are available for stricter diets.
