Even the White House is not immune. Though the Obamas do not dare to complain about living in the nation's most historic home, aides and friends say they have privately wrestled with the same issues that all state-owned residences present, from limited privacy to living spaces that are all not quite as glamorous as the regal exteriors suggest. (When the first family moved in, they found out-of-date technology — the phones in the residence only rang in one room — and carpet stains from the Bush pets.)
For all his quirks, Allen can be persuasive and motivated. He's well connected and has been able to swing open previously closed doors in other corners of his business portfolio.

Frankly, the Discovery, Atlantis, Endeavour and Enterprise vehicles are already paid for. There is no need to raise more money to pay for them or maintain them. As stated earlier, every federal taxpaying citizen over the last 50 years has taken care of that. Certainly one of them belongs in the Smithsonian, which, ironically, will require visitors to take a 31-mile drive from the current Air & Space Museum in Washington, D.C., to see it. And how could the Kennedy Space Center be denied a trophy for actually launching all of them as well as fixing and storing them between flights?
Of course, the Nets traded a first-round pick -- protected through the first three selections -- to the Portland Trail Blazers at the March 15 trade deadline to get Wallace.

Sitting, quite alone, just inside 1,000 acres of Norfolk parkland, on England's East Coast, is a rather special place: the Gunton Arms, a Victorian-style pub with rooms that art dealer Ivor Braka and his artist-wife, Sarah Graham, transformed into a comfortable, refreshingly contemporary retreat.

"I never dreamed of going to college and when I got to college I never dreamed of going to the pros," Haley said.

It's interesting that San Francisco officials say they couldn't pay Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi while he is suspended, because paying someone not to work would be seen as an illegal gift of public funds.
a generation of students and graduates is walking off campus with a collective $1 trillion in student loan debt and troubling career prospects. The daunting combination is forcing them to rethink their futures, postponing weddings, home purchases and vacations to make hefty monthly payments on loans that will follow them into middle age.
That was the key sticking point that many of the fans dwell on. But there were other parts of the game that stood out as well. Austin Jackson looked terrific, going 3-for-5 and driving home the game-winner in the ninth. Its obviously just one game, but Alex Avila got off to a hot start last season and rode that to an All-Star start and a Silver Slugger. Fast starts can often lead to good seasons. But lets see how Jackson does over the next week or so. It was fascinating as well to see Bostons pitching deal with the Miguel Cabrera/Prince Fielder package in the lineup. Vicente Padilla intentionally walked Cabrera at one point to get to Fielder. I cant say as I blame him, but Im guessing thats the first time that any pitcher has ever put a man on first to get to Fielder. And Im guessing that wont be the last time we see this season for the Tigers.

In a Dummies.com article, authors David Rosen and Caryn Mladen said that free money gets awarded to the students who are most attractive to people awarding the money. And “attractive” in this case doesn’t mean the ability to win a beauty contest. “The most attractive students,” they wrote, “are the ones who are most likely to reflect positively on the college or the giving institution by doing well in school and becoming successful, famous and wealthy — and, of course, giving back to the community.”
Lindbergh draws SLUH Friday at 5 p.m. Nydegger is hopeful the Flyers can give SLUH a game.
There are a couple of menu items under the cryptic heading "Craig's List" that are essentially foods for the gastronomically timid (a burger, a steak); the rest of the short menu is a hold-on-to-your-hat wild ride. On my first visit I had a salad with roasted fennel and roasted sliced radish ($7), with a teeny whiff of coriander and what tasted like orange. The roasting gives the radish a mellower character, kind of like a rutabaga mated with a daikon. The second time a salad of peppery dressed arugula ($7) was encircled by paper-thin beet and potato slices, each with a nice crunch to them (if they weren't raw, they were blanched for like a second).

Bernard Parker, the longest serving member of the Wayne County Commission, is calling it quits after 22 years, but plans to run for Detroit City Council next summer.
The bill stems from the decision last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to end a failed 1987 program that barred sea otters from most Southern California waters and sought to establish a second sea otter population by moving 140 of them from Monterey Bay to San Nicolas Island, 60 miles off the coast, in case a disaster, such as an oil spill, put them at risk of extinction.

At a City Council meeting Monday night, however, City Administrator Deanna Santana said the city had decided to abandon the arrangement and sign a contract directly with a licensed investigator.
Even the dollar figures – which usually grab the headlines – are more like goals, experts say. There's no contract. If China doesn't buy $4.4 billion worth of Missouri-made goods in the next three years, they're not going to cut our state a check for the difference.

But one doesn't have to be an ideological majoritarian to sniff in Bishop's proposal the strong smell of long-dishonored endeavors to thwart majority rule in the United States.

I was struck immediately by how pathetic Kelley looks. Though just 42, he shuffled slowly into court like a senior citizen after a bad fall, unsteady and unsure where he's headed. He had gained substantial weight since he left town for Florida. (He lost his houses and he and his family live in Florida with his mother.)
Some of the body parts were found miles away in Kentucky.
Great apples require great apple recipes. Last year's blue-ribbon pie was topped with a crumbly walnut mixture and cinnamon cream sauce. Caramel-flavored apple crisp emerged top winner in the dessert category. All dessert makers chosen to participate win prizes.
“He wrote it by hand and took this clear packaging tape and taped it to my arm,” said Carr, now the Giants’ backup quarterback. “It wasn’t even a wristband. It was just a card taped to my arm. By the first 10 plays, I was sweating so much and it was soaked. The ink is running down my arm. It was a failed experiment. And you’re in fifth grade, so you barely have any arm hair at all and now you have this huge empty patch that you’ve got to explain to everybody. Ugly.”

Based on Yasmina Reza's Tony-winning play "God of Carnage," the Roman Polanski-directed domestic drama "Carnage" stars Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly as sensitive Brooklyn parents whose son gets beaten up on the playground by the son of an uptight couple played by Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet. Over the course of 80 taut minutes, the four adults talk it out — starting out civilly and then turning more savage. All of this probably made for a riveting evening of theater, but on screen all four of the principles come off as overexcited and out of sync with one another, in a plot that's gimmicky and predictable. There are flashes of brilliance, but the movie as a whole never coheres. Special features are limited.
Whichever member of the Gulfport High School girls' basketball team long-jumped the farthest would receive the much-desired refreshment.
A spokesman for the store said the store would have a reply April 26.
"We're not getting into details because there is a substantial danger of them being misused by the jury, of creating an emotional response,'' said Cena, adding that the priest would have to deny he molested anyone for the testimony to come in.

Concern over the link between social media and crime heightened in February, when a proposed state law, the "flash mob bill," would have criminalized tweets and emails that ask people to commit a crime. The proposal later fizzled.
Picking this one won’t be difficult when you have Skylar Diggins and the Fighting Irish opening things up at home and not encountering much difficulty until they get to the Elite Eight. From there, one still has to like coach Muffet McGraw and Notre Dame, even while running into the likes of either Texas A&M — which beat the Irish in last year’s title game — or the No. 2-seed Maryland. Diggins, who is averaging 17 points and 5.7 assists, leads a team that already beat Connecticut twice this year and is operating with confidence as the new top dog in the Big East. The Irish also saw what it was like to have the NCAA title stolen, when last year red-hot Texas A&M swiped the trophy in one of the better title games over the past 10 years.

Pre was offered $200,000 to turn pro but said no. Had he taken the money, he would have lost his amateur status and his eligibility to compete in the 1976 Olympics. Yet the AAU offered no help with the costs of training, competition and living. He was internationally famous -- a reputation he solidified in college -- but frustrated, all but forced to take race money under the table.

Having recapitulated the Enlightenment for herself in a few short years, Hirsi Ali has surveyed every inch of the path leading out of the moral and intellectual wasteland that is traditional Islam. She has written two luminous books describing her journey, the most recent of which, "Infidel," has been an international bestseller for months. It is difficult to exaggerate her courage. As Christopher Caldwell wrote in the New York Times, "Voltaire did not risk, with his every utterance, making a billion enemies who recognized his face and could, via the Internet, share information instantaneously with people who aspired to assassinate him."
After her husband, Ken, leaves for work at Adobe Systems, a caregiver comes for a few hours, but for most of the day she is on her own. "I cannot lift my arm to eat," Kameda says. "I can't change my clothes; I can't bathe myself. I'm dependent on everybody else to help me be able to be who I am." That's why she's jumping. "We want people to know how devastating and cruel this disease is. You become a prisoner inside your own body."

"The Sing-Off" is also part of that trend. Last season, one of the competing groups was the Beelzebubs, the all-male a cappella group from Tufts University. They didn't win "The Sing-Off," but they recently had a number-one hit as the voices behind "Glee" co-star Darren Criss on a version of Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" featured on a recent "Glee" episode.

The film opens with high schooler Camille (Lola Créton) having a rendezvous with her slightly older first boyfriend, Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky).

And the party's long-term thinkers worry that the Arizona law is merely a quick political fix which may create a permanent rift with the fastest growing segment of the U.S. electorate.
The idea turned out to be. . . well, all wet.
Have you ever wondered what it might be like to eat a stone? Because it's probably less wonderful than you might have imagined as a preschooler. The clay cracks under your teeth—the coating is no thicker than a shrimp shell—leaving behind only a clean, powdery residue and a lingering taste of unwashed potato. Kaolin clay is the preferred nosh of pregnant women afflicted with pica; the famous dirt-eaters of Georgia. It was also at one time the main ingredient in Kaopectate. In parts of Turkey, cookbook author Paula Wolfert says, you can buy little jars of the stuff to season your food. (Aduriz sprinkles a little of the powder on a pale dish of hake and cabbage sprouts.) It is clear that you can eat clay. The question is why you would want to.
The school said Wednesday that it plans to replace the stolen artwork with a new piece by the same artist, Brother Mel Meyer of Kirkwood.
A commanding presence in the huddle is part of it. Kosar would not have hesitated to order Edwards to the bench when he got quarrelsome, or Kellen Winslow when he ran the wrong pattern. He was in charge. He had earned that respect.
I declined, nervous about my rusty skills, though I thought back to my night at the French Laundry, where I was graciously, but vigilantly, relegated to observing (for the story, go to sfgate.com/ZKLQ). The Perbacco line, apparently, can absorb the screwups of a newbie. What started as 141 customers on the books became, by the end of the night, 234. Behind the line, three floating sous chefs - an unusual amount of support - helped busy stations.

11. B.J. Coleman, Tennessee-Chattanooga, 6-3, 232: A transfer from Tennessee, Coleman has a strong arm and is pretty accurate. There is some impressive tape of him. He is a little raw and has not played much against top competition. He must be viewed as a project.
Further complicating the race for the Republican nominee is the Democratic Governors Association's decision to put Colorado on its list of states set for "Project Extreme GOP Makeover." The plan is to exploit rifts within the Republican Party and pick up more centrist voters who think Tea Party candidates are too extreme.
Influence — whether it's in a home where parents work to provide their children with better opportunities, in a classroom where a teacher pushes a student to new heights, in a conference room where a deal is cut, or in the history someone leaves the world to ponder and discover — knows no bounds.
Fernandez dribbled past the screen before it happened and darted to the middle and inside the key as Aldridge slipped through on the reverse side toward the basket. Fernandez was instantly swarmed by three Dallas defenders who didn't want to allow a wide open layup and, after he took one step past the free throw line, Fernandez blindly floated a high-arcing lob over two Mavericks.
BC's winning streak is the longest in head coach Jerry York's 18 seasons.
Cruiserweight's Smith Tower. The band was breaking up, and Stella Maxwell sounded incredibly bummed about it. The songs were about giving up on dreams and justifying your existence and life choices to invisible interlocutors, and the Maxwell brother (Cruiserweight was basically a family act) who jumped ship right before the boat went down. Even the cover was illustrated in heavy greens and browns. It's an interesting companion to the explosive Big Bold Letters, but I don't think I'll be returning to it very much, and I'd advise the band not to spin it before Christmases and Thanksgivings at the Maxwell house.

Most of "A Drummer's Dream" is composed of drum solos. Depending on your background and tastes, this is either a draw or a reason to stay far away from the theater.

2009 Anam Cara Nicholas Estate Chehalem Mountains Pinot Noir ($32, 13.6%): Sheila and Nick Nicholas faithfully maintain the Oregon vision of small-scale charm with their estate near Newberg. This bottling, from all five estate blocks, offers a classic profile aged in mostly older oak that hints at a lighter style for the vintage. Minty, cool and shady, with camphor and bayberry, and a wonderful floral accent. Almost ethereal in its subtle red fruit, but still built to age.
1. Kentucky has lost 45 NCAA Tournament games in its history, and more than a one-quarter have come from the three other schools joining them in Newark this weekend.

Happy Presidents' Day. This holiday, which dates to 1971, originally was meant to celebrate the birthdays of George Washington (Feb. 22) and Abraham Lincoln (Feb. 12) but it's also meant to honor all presidents. In the spirit, we offer you this quiz. How well do you know our chief executives? You'll learn lots from visiting the 13 presidential libraries. Forty-four presidents have been installed in office, but there are only 43 people who have been president. Why? Take the quiz below and find out:

"You can count on me to defend these ideas, convictions," he said, "but my place cannot be the same."
For such a conventional candidate, Miller's council campaign in many ways defies logic. Unlike most entrenched Democrats, Miller supported Issue 6, last year's ballot measure that set up the new government. He is not term-limited in the Ohio Senate, and the council would be a pay cut for him. And he has pledged not to retire, then double-dip -- a legal but controversial move that would allow him to collect his public pension and council salary if elected.

Appropriateness, however, has pretty much been jettisoned by the filmmakers, who have opted instead for the good-fun-found-in-bad-taste tradition of "The Hangover." Directed by David Wain and co-written with his frequent comic collaborator, Ken Marino, the film is, overall, a very wobbly affair starting with all the dangling naked body parts that greet George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) when the couple pulls into a free-love commune they mistake for a B&B.
“I don’t take it out too much, but it’s just a memory that you’ll never forget. Being on the biggest stage in sports and you’ll always remember it win or lose. That was the first and I’ve had the pleasure to be in three. This will be my third one and I’ve won one, lost one. Anytime you can get to this step, it’s a big, big accomplishment. It’s so hard to win against the best athletes in the world. So anytime you get here, it’s always special.”

When his team faced Wainwright earlier this season, Milwaukee manager Ron Roenicke made point that pitchers are "usually not the same" until the second year after surgery. Hudson returned to start after a year of rehab but finished fourth in Cy Young voting the next season, 2010, which started 19 months after his surgery.

The Beavers scored two more unearned runs in the fourth, thanks again to Weiss. As he did in the first, Weiss walked the leadoff batter, then threw away a sacrifice bunt to put runners on second and third.

Hammel identifies that theme as perseverance in life, and the determination to get up off the mat and do it again. But “Mountaintops” is also a portrait of a long-term relationship — from its origins in lucky happenstance (“Total Serendipity”) to romantic complications (“At Least I Have You”) to artistic struggles and making ends meet (“Basement Money”) to the daily thrill of commitment (“Maracas”). The Mates’ partnership has always been an enormous part of the group’s story, and Gardner and Hammel have alluded to their relationship in song before. Yet they’ve never been as candid, or clear, about love and marriage as they are on the new set.

Where have the years gone? "I don't know, man," said Broadview Heights resident Lupica, a 1974 Maple Heights High School graduate. "It's been my whole life since I started this thing back in 1975 in a basement in Aurora. We had our day in the sun dabbling in originals and opening some bigger shows in the late '70s and early '80s. We're still a big production band with a lot of sound and lights. We're six-men live, that's what we always say. We don't use any gimmicks. It's just us playing good classic-rock stuff. We're six weekend warriors."
The production is one that has been in the works for several years, Chuck Bowden, one of the show's directors, said.

The new Joe's Burgers will actually be a "Joe's Burgers & Bar," with televisions, table service and an expanded menu with pizzas -- a holdover from JoPa's menu -- and some Tex-Mex fare. It's a departure from the first Joe's Burgers location, a 250 square foot kiosk in the Bridgeport Village mall.
This one had a lot of down time, with both fighters having trouble keeping their shoelaces tied properly in the second round. It was definitely in the eye of the beholder because neither fighter wore down.

It is debatable — perhaps — that any couple was ever as exquisite as Clift and Taylor in their huge, yearning closeups. (“The most gorgeous thing in the world,” she called him later.) She was so exquisite, in fact, it threw the story — based on “An American Tragedy” — a little off. Who wouldn’t ditch Shelley Winters if Elizabeth Taylor was waiting?
The echo in "Are You My Mother?" may be coincidence. But, by the internal evidence, Bechtel is capable of infernal ingenuity and the wryest of pranks, so I choose to think it is deliberate.
The slow-cooked farm egg ($16) with fried farrow with chicken - the kitchen's take on fried rice - was a bit too soupy for me. Roast pork ($18) with a small salad of winter vegetables set on a spicy squash puree and a vadouvan vinaigrette was one of the few instances where the flavors fought and only the pork came out the victor.
"Anheuser-Busch has always contended that all brewers in Illinois can distribute.... all brewers," said legal counsel Ed Crane. "That's how the law reads and we believe that the liquor commission was the one that made the mistake here."
After what initially looked like a harmless dump-in by Bouillon, the puck caromed off the side glass and into the slot. Smith was behind the net expecting to corral the shoot-in, so Brandon Yip pounced on the loose puck and buried it into the open cage to make it 1-1 at 14:09.

After watching the replay the first time, at regular speed, I figured Hillis was at fault. The ball was in his hands, then it wasn't. He was hit by Tampa Bay linebacker Barrett Ruud, who must have jarred it loose. (The camera angle was from behind the Browns' backfield).

On failing to make it as a Cardinal: "I really never felt good in St. Louis. I always felt like I wasn't … I don't know. I was always so much younger than everybody else, and I just felt like I was never really, I guess you could say, a part of the team kind of. I never got comfortable, and Tony wanted it that way. He always said he didn't want me to get comfortable, he wanted me to always stay working hard and doing this and doing that. So I think that was one thing that might have hurt my game a little bit. I feel like it would be good for me to get comfortable, and know I'm going to be here and know I'm going to be a part of the team, know I'm going to be here ‘til the end instead of worrying about maybe getting sent down and this and that. Just go out there to play the game, have fun, relax. During the offseason I had a lot of time to spend with my family. It's quiet in Alabama, you know. Spent a lot of time with just my family and some people that I know, not dealing with all the riff-raff, all this stuff. I think right now I'm in good shape and feeling good mentally, so we'll see what happens down the road."

If Arizonans thought that was the first step in becoming a real part of the United States of America, they were sadly mistaken. There is an eerie and cruel irony in this history.

Surprisingly enough, one of my favorite looks came from Miley Cyrus, who has tended toward very overworked and far too mature gowns of late. The white David Koma cocktail dress will raise some eyebrows, to be sure, with a plunging neckline secured with a sheer panel, but between the artfully draped skirt and Lite-Brite-esque embellishments, the overall effect was more chic than suggestive. Stone, meanwhile, opted for a green tuxedo-style look from Gucci and looked like the coolest drum major ever. Ginnifer Goodwin always always chooses edgy over elegant, and her shocking pink Roksanda Ilinic almost straddled the line, but those hideous bell sleeves lands her in the atrocious category.

But man, they put on a good show. Over the course of the evening, I would taste dishes and burst out laughing - the flavors were so perfectly melded, the produce such high quality, the presentation so clever, the accompaniments so playful (the foie gras is presented with six kinds of salt from all over the world, including one pink and one black) that I didn't know how else to react. It seemed like cruel and unusual punishment to taste dishes within eyeshot of the cooks who had never tasted their own creations, but the cooks were so focused they didn't even glance my way. I tried to thank Hollingsworth, but could only muster a small groan of pleasure. He seemed used to that response.

All is not perfect here. Notably regrettable was the pistachio-crusted rack of lamb ($25). It sounded promising but arrived fatty, strewn with gristle and overwhelmed by a ladle full of mint pesto. Then, presented with a dull steak knife. Once deconstructed (this was one of those rare circumstances where I thought to call for a scalpel) the meat was tasty, but disappointing overall.

Where we stayed — Our flight was delayed several hours departing from St. Louis, and the Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort & Spa (sandestinbeachhilton.com) is about 24 miles from the airport, so we didn't get to our hotel room until after midnight. But waking up the next morning to the sound of crashing waves was an ideal way to start the weekend. Stepping onto the balcony with a stunning view of the Gulf was even better. The hotel is in a prime location, with a private beach for guests a short walk from the oversized guest rooms. Umbrella and two-chair beach setup costs $42.80 for the day, and we used this service both days. The resort is a magnet for families, conferences and weddings, so expect it be hopping during the peak season. Part of our room's private balcony overlooked one of the three hotel pools, which are open into the evening hours. The staff was exceptionally friendly, and there was a vibe of Southern hospitality at the hotel restaurants we visited. Self-parking a car at the hotel costs $10 a day and valet is $20. The room we stayed in, a beachfront room in the Spa Tower, had a king bed, a sofa sleeper and a parlor area. Rates start from $179 to $499, depending on season and availability.

I think it's probably healthy right now for regular Americans everywhere to consider that we've already begun to take Phelps for granted. He's become reliable. Automatic, even.

øBut this begs the question - how exactly do you do it? When someone goes the self-employment route, they usually know a lot about the sort of business they may want to start (the gardener knows plants, the graphic artist knows how to design a website). But they usually do not know a lot about the other two-thirds of a business: How to get customers, advertising and marketing, law and taxes, how to buy their own health insurance, and on and on.

As for Mount Dora, which has it's own playoff goals in Class 2B, Harley is the dual-threat quarterback. He can throw it or tuck it and run. That's what makes him so dangerous. He could even wind up a with 1,000 yards rushing and a 1,000 yards passing. The rushing part should be easy. He currently has 877.

Mendocino's downtown was built by New England craftsmen, who patterned the buildings after those they left on the other side of the continent. Because it has been designated a historic preservation area, the city's center looks much like it did when it was built in the 1880s. That means it doesn't take a lot of work on camera angles to produce footage that could easily represent life from a 100 years ago or across the continent.
NOTES: Pettitte appeared at Roger Clemens' perjury trial in Washington, D.C., and testified about his HGH usage and the conversations he had with Roger Clemens about HGH. Girardi said he didn't think Pettitte was distracted by his imminent appearance on the stand when he allowed six runs in 5 2/3 innings in an extended spring training game Monday but admitted, "I'm sure it was on his mind.

I filled three half wine barrels with compost and manure and planted tomatoes, cukes and corn. Note to self: Corn needs more room to thrive. But it lived. Everything lived. And I was barrel-proud.
And in South Carolina, where the Jan. 21 primary is shaping up to be a make-or-break date for social conservatives who want to slow Mitt Romney's momentum, evangelicals make up about 60 percent of likely voters. Surveys already show Santorum already spiking to a strong second place behind Romney.

As for what the Indians are getting in Damon, though some will remember Damon for what he was and not acknowledge him for what he now is, Johnny Damon is not the on-base machine that he’s been in the past and Anderson writes of Damon in his aforementioned B-Pro piece that, “it is fair to write that Damon is no longer the batter he was once. His walk rate (about 8 percent) marked his lowest since 2004. He doesn’t make contact as often as he did before, though he can still keep an at-bat alive by spoiling pitches… Damon is 38 now, and a dramatic improvement is unlikely.”"

Tents are not the only line of defense, Backer said. Hospitals that remain open in a disaster could add beds beyond normal capacity.

When the story of Jonah popped up in this year's lectionary readings, I initially ignored it. But then I took a second look.
Price's use of bright color on clay forms was a distinctive feature of his work. Sometimes he achieved it through the use of acrylic paint rather than fired glazes, a method that upset ceramic purists but satisfied the artist's determination to follow his interests. The technique has reached new heights since the 1990s. Sexy, bulbous forms are painted black, layered with lush acrylic colors and then sanded to reveal the under-paint in richly textured spots of brilliant hues. Some sculptures carry 70 thin coats of paint.
Shriver's take on journalism and international politics is wry, insightful and just over the top enough to be fun. Yet it is a little bit baggy; it feels very much like a book written in an author's becoming, when she was still operating in the shadows. Now, after winning the Orange Prize for "We Need to Talk About Kevin" and having Tilda Swinton star in the film adaptation, she is herself at the center of things.

Morgan asked questions he knew she did not wish to be asked, and although she seldom answered them, he made sure she was always refusing, in the process, in spite of herself, revealing very much indeed. She spoke of her thoughts of suicide while pregnant at 14, and when he asked if she ever wondered how things might have been had her child lived (it did not), she snapped a too-quick "No." But then came a passionate, detailed answer that showed she thinks about it all the time.

True, any bronzed, gorgeous young thing with a good stylist and taste is going to look smashing in just about anything, but Alba's gold Versace halter with lace embroidery was a hard one to beat for the perfect match of starlet to gown. Not too old, not too young, just the right color and shape.

Through restaurant cookbooks this year, we traveled from Southern California to New York and north into Canada.

The film also pits the Player (Romany Malco) versus the 90-Day Girl (Meagan Good) — 90 days is how long she’s supposed to “keep the cookie in the cookie jar.” That last gem says it all about this movie’s coy substitutes for love, lust or wit.
"These fascinating native bees provide ecological services to us and our gardens, and they now need us to help them," Zagory said. "Planting plants that have lots of nectar and pollen in their flowers is like putting seed in a bird feeder. If you plant (the right plants), they will come."

A new wheelchair with the capability of allowing him to stand-upright, would mean he could join classmates at the chalkboard, where they may be completing math problems, or in English class, where students are discussing new topics for a writing project. A new wheelchair would give him the flexibility to move leisurely around his neighborhood, the halls at Edison Intermediate School, and navigate through malls and other shopping areas.

A. It's a big problem. Just an example of something we've been involved with for years is the IRS. A lot of small businesses use independent contractors to do whatever they need on a part-time basis. Let's say as a construction company, I build a house every other month. I need people for a short little spurt to put a roof on, and then I don't need them. The regulations on independent contractors were something like 200 to 300 pages. There's no small business owner that's going to sit down and try and understand a couple hundred pages of IRS stuff. That's just way too complicated.
But no one should be surprised if the clerk continues to move at a snail's pace.
Many conservative Republicans think government is the problem rather than the solution; they view the federal bureaucracy as stifling free markets and its regulations as hindering prosperity. Many of them agree with former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm’s suggestion that we should “starve the government.” These folks do not see FDR’s three-part construct — the private sector providing jobs for those aspiring to move up on the economic ladder, unions fighting for adequate wages and benefits for workers, and government providing a safety net for those who, because of disability and/or inability, can’t make it — as a blueprint for America’s future. They believe this paradigm is passé.
