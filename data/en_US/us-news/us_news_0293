It wanted to avoid holding a neutral-site game that would draw 23,000 fans and be a money-bleeding disaster. But they also want a neutral-site feel to the home game? The conference wants to reward the team with the best regular-season record. But also, it doesn't want the team with the best record to feel totally at home? They want local media to buy in and promote the game. But the Pac-12 granted even fewer credentials to local outlets than the Bowl Championship Series did last January?

As recently noted in an opinion piece by Sandra Pianalto, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's president and CEO, "firms are more likely to open and maintain high-tech factories -- the kind that are likely to survive and thrive in the United States amid global competition -- in regions with large populations of highly skilled workers. Investments in human capital will not only help build the needed work force of the future, but will also form the foundation of our ability to innovate both in and outside manufacturing."
Gone, says ex-Chrysler employee Anthony E. Torres, are the new cars and other "luxuries" supported by an auto worker salary.
I don't see the world through the same prism as Charles Krauthammer but I have to agree with him about the Social Security trust fund. What trust fund? There is only a promise from Washington to pay benefits, backed by the full faith and credit of our government but not by assets. Even the idea of a dedicated FICA tax is a sham. Let's call it what it truly is, just another stream of revenue to be spent faster than it comes in. Congress should do away with the separate social security tax when they reconfigure (hopefully) the tax system. There is no reason why all income shouldn't be treated-- taxed-- equally, other than to meet the desires and expectations of special interest groups.
Jackie went on to say in her email that she home-schools her kids and thinks that money spent on education is largely wasted. So she would not mind seeing money diverted from education to veterans homes.

Unlike some athletic powerhouses, Cal's athletic department isn't self sufficient. From 2003 to 2011 it stayed solvent only by receiving a total of $88.4 million in campus funds, according to research by Barsky.

The program, the last in the ensemble's 20th anniversary season, was ideal for Breen, especially since Bach's concertos shine the spotlight on so many musicians. Sorrell presided over three Brandenburgs (Nos. 3, 4 and 6) and Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D minor.
For those not up to hiking the steep paved path that winds down from the cave's natural entrance, a high-speed elevator zips down the 75 stories in less than a minute.

“If federal dollars are building Foothills Road, then that is a huge benefit to the city of Lake Oswego and the streetcar project,” she said.
Given the ongoing decline in DVD revenue, that means studios must try to predict what audiences in Moscow, Shanghai and Rio de Janeiro want to see. The safest bet is often over-the-top action and effects that don't need any translation. Even the effects-laden digital dud "John Carter," which grossed a measly $69 million in the U.S. and Canada, took in $200 million internationally.
Other dishes were good, but for one reason or another, not quite at the level that has earned Bruell a kitchen full of well-deserved national acclaim over the years. A grilled romaine salad didn't spend enough time on the grill to give the lettuce any char flavor. A naan pizza topped with Bolognese sauce and gruyere scored high on the creativity meter, but an oversized dollop of ricotta cheese on each slice overwhelmed all the savory, subtle flavors. The ancho pepper sauce with the braised pork shoulder was more of a seasoning than a sauce, and the pork was rather dry.

For all the noise about Goldman—pressure on its board, governance practices, the Greg Smith resignation fiasco, to name just three examples—the reality is that if any overhauls are delivered at the company's shareholder meeting next month, it will be because Goldman has lost its knack at making money.
Horror is not typically a genre known for creativity. Most films follow the path of overly-trod scenarios, and any spark of originality that does show up gets wrung out in a relentless series of carbon-copy sequels (see: "Final Destination," "Saw" and "Paranormal Activity").
The writer of the letter “End the death penalty” (April 30) does not speak for me or a lot of other New Jersey citizens when she writes, “We in New Jersey support this bold action,“ referring to Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signing a bill to do away with the death penalty in that state.

Arizona's cities and towns are gaining a national reputation for piling it on with sales taxes, and the bite is often higher in outlying areas.
Liggett CEO Ron Bernstein, whose company sells discount cigarettes that are taxed at the higher rate, said his company estimates the tax loopholes have cost the government even more. About 2.7 million people purchased roll-your-own cigarettes last year, and that could reach 3 million in 2012, he said, citing data from the Treasury Department and Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention.

The problem was that players were set to exit at one end of the building, opposite where the media stood. Just because they knew we were there doesn't mean each player knew he was wanted for an interview.

Said Currie, “The team at HomeTowne Television, led by director Jesse Patterson continues to create quality broadcasting and I’m so pleased that their efforts have been recognized by their peers.

Manguso writes that the motive behind this book is to keep his death from haunting her. Yet like Didion's magical thinking, Manguso finds herself looking for evidence of Harris' presence, hoping for a ghost. She sits on a bench in Central Park dedicated to him and waits for a sign; to an outsider, the T-shirt she sees as significant seems sadly random. And yet. In showing how the moment of his death has receded into insignificance, she writes, "no one could possibly be able to remember the mundanities of July 23, 2008." Except me. It was my birthday.
"My initial thought was that someone was pulling a practical joke to trip people," he said. But when he began following the trail of the wire he discovered otherwise.

Heider said he would issue an "all-clear" when service is restored.
It's a given that great quartets have great ensemble, but what was especially striking was the way individual lines and textures constantly emerged from the blended whole, then gracefully receded. Their unerring sense of timing produced seamless transitions in the Beethoven, but also in the opener, Joseph Haydn's Op. 76, No. 2; nimbly leaping into phrases, especially in up-tempo outer movements, their impetuous forward motion made the entire piece seem to take just seconds without seeming rushed. And even in the church's dry acoustic, their tone was consistently lovely.
The stream was full of feisty rainbows, many eager to take a fly floating along in the current. Kelley was investing his efforts in a hopper pattern, a dry fly mimicking a grasshopper that was clumsy enough to fall into the water.

The solution: Bleich recommends using your hand as a guide — a serving size should fit in your palm. "If you get a burger the size of your face, only eat half," she says. Sugiuchi suggests that dieters cook at home and use precise measurements for everything, from the oil they cook with to the amount of cereal they put in a bowl and the amount of dressing they pour on a salad. "They're still calories, and they add up," she says. At restaurants, she recommends asking the waiter to box up half the meal immediately. If it's not on your plate, you won't be tempted.

Originally built in 1968, Mark Twain thrived for many years with a diversity of clothing stores, drug stores, a grocery store, Central Hardware and a movie theater.

Flexible spending accounts, or FSAs, give some people with employer-based health coverage a chance to set aside pre-tax wages for some medical expenses not covered by insurance, but they come with a big catch. You have to use the balance before the end of your plan year -- which is Dec. 31 in many cases -- or you lose the money.
His story begins with memories of his grandmother's cooking, segues into war and displacement and ends with a condensed history lesson: Istria was part of Italy for 2,000 years, its destiny entwined with the Roman and Venetian empires.

This prevalent use of prescription drugs to help one sleep may sound excessive, but doctors say that today's non-opiate sleep-inducers aren't anything like those that people used in the 1950s and '60s that we associate with addiction and overdoses. Taken normally, sleeping pills like Ambien -- which are known as sedative-hypnotics -- don't create a physical addiction or physical withdrawal symptoms, they note. They also don't leave most people with anything like the morning-after grogginess that old-style sleeping medicines did.

“I was speaking to the manager about donating some dresses to the cause, and he said they'd donate three brand new dresses. After I met him to pick the dresses up, he offered me a job!”
Chandler is known for his novels, all featuring hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe. Marlowe saw a city full of both beauty and betrayal, and to survive he followed his own moral code: He lied to cops, took beatings from bad guys and regularly got and/or rejected the most beautiful woman in the room. Chandler wrote with the bitterness of a brokenhearted romantic: tough yet ready to fall in love again. His prose was indelible. "It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window," he wrote in 1940's "Farewell, My Lovely," his second novel.
Don't rush to see the digitally remastered main film first. Take time to savor the bonus feature in which Jerry Seinfeld narrates a 45-minute documentary (first aired in 1995) that puts into perspective the careers of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, two of the most popular figures in radio and movies in January 1941, when this film was released. Being a total lover of the Abbott-Costello team, Seinfeld explores their years in vaudeville that gave them a background for visual and verbal comedy, especially the shtick of misunderstood words, or the "Who's on First" genre. And how the boys went on to become cherished radio, film and TV stars, Lou the rotund buffoon, Bud the seemingly serious-minded straight man. "Buck Privates" itself (a box office smash followed by 14 more Universal Studio Abbott-Costello hits before World War II was over) is a silly but entertaining comedy with moments of pure slapstick as the boys mistakenly get themselves drafted, but it also focuses on the Andrews Sisters, who energetically deliver a number of their popular songs surrounded by vibrant, young boogie-woogie dancers. Absolutely ridiculous, and fun in the same breath. This special set has both Blu-ray and regular DVDs and is highlighted by a 46-page color booklet (introduced by John Landis) with biographies, photographs, newspaper reproductions and other features.
KG: I think there were a lot of women that really wanted to win that race. Tune and (Bezunesh) Bekele , they have a personal rivalry going on, they wanted to be the ones that won it for Ethiopia. They weren't going to lead. They were going to wait each other out to the very end. Whenever anyone went to the front, they realized how windy it was. I'd go and get my water bottle and be by myself and I'd be like, 'Wow, it's really windy. I'm really working here.'
The Pacers got their final chance to tie the score when West and Hill double-teamed Turner as soon as he caught the inbounds pass, causing the jump ball.
ODOT is considering transferring ownership of Oregon 43 to Portland and Multnomah and Clackamas counties. Most officials agree that Oregon 43 no longer functions as a state highway but more as a local arterial. Therefore, it makes sense that local jurisdictions would control the roadway.

In addition to the $70 million in overspending that the legislature approved, the governor would have to cut an additional $80 million because of other provisions in the "doomsday" plan.

The Provenge trial included 512 men who had advanced prostate cancer that was not responsive to hormone therapy, a standard treatment for prostate cancer. The vaccine differs from the others in that a patient's own immune cells are removed, fitted with a marker for prostate cancer (called prostatic acid phosphatase or PAP), and injected back into the patient. Three-year survival rates were 31% for vaccinated subjects and 23% for control subjects.

• Trail Blazers hand Warriors brutal loss -- Marcus Thompson II, The Oakland Tribune: Portland guard Jamal Crawford, a former Warrior, scored five points in the final 1:03 to lift the Blazers. Meanwhile, Robinson -- who scored 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter -- missed his last two shots and nearly turned it over before he could attempt a game-winner in the final seconds. Stumbling through the lane, he shoveled the ball to forward Brandon Rush in the corner. But Rush did not get off his 3-pointer in time and missed anyway.

"Missouri isn't like California and other sunshine states where that may be appropriate," Douglass said. "In Missouri, cities should have the ability to listen to neighbors and to work with a neighborhood on what they would want a solar installation to be like."
How can it possibly be constitutional for Pennsylvania to pass a law requiring doctors to sign an oath of silence (euphemistically called confidentiality) to know which potentially harmful chemicals are being introduced into the environment? Why should they be prevented from letting patients know the reason for their illnesses? Have we come to the point at which the Constitution is just another pesky regulation that corporations can ignore in their quest for a bigger bottom line?

One solution was to help vets get the Veterans Affairs benefits they'd earned but hadn't used, freeing up capacity elsewhere in the system. Only 80,000 of the 351,000 veterans in Oregon receive federal benefits, valued at $1.12 billion. That means another $4 billion in benefits is out there.
A couple of the youths in the church program have been wounded in shootings, and some arrive from homes where parents are engaged in illegal activity. Giving them a safe and spiritual haven is rewarding, he said.

4. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) Patricia Watson: This quirky little-seen film was an edgy breath of fresh air, the story of game-show pioneer Chuck Barris (skillfully played by Sam Rockwell) and his tall tale, after his fame faded, that he had been a longtime CIA agent.

What Brookfield should or should not be permitted to forbid in the plaza should be hashed out in an open discussion with the city and the protesters, Kayden said.
There's no way the Cleveland Landmarks Commission is going to make everyone happy when it comes to the century-old Columbia Building.

Hale had the voice to bring it back. He could simultaneously be pretty and menacing, tuneful and tough. His outro to the sixth track on "The Chronic" was an outright challenge; an invitation to throw punches. "Regulate," his 1994 collaboration with rapper Warren G, told the story of a gunfight.
Companies pay annual fees to list their stock, and exchanges also garner listings-related income from the sale of market data and ancillary services offered to their listed companies.

Instead, he blistered a 5-wood into the breeze on the eighth hole — the toughest par 3 on the course — and watched it catch a slope on the edge of the green and roll 8 feet away from the cup. That was the first of four straight birdies for Woods, who wound up with a 68.
And perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised. The history of video games is so brief that there are plenty of people alive who were adults when there was no such thing as video games. Struggling for legitimacy is something the industry itself had to contend with until the money started pouring in. Then all the ancillary business (such as writing about games) followed suit.
NEW YORK -- Musician Gil Scott-Heron, who helped lay the groundwork for rap by fusing minimalistic percussion, political expression and spoken-word poetry on songs such as "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," died Friday at age 62.

The board also claims Holloway improperly obtained recordings of executive sessions -- closed meetings where confidential matters, such as real estate transactions and litigation may be discussed. Copies of such meetings are not circulated. The board has a transcript of of an executive session illegally recorded by Holloway.
A: His attention to detail. Coach Sloan is not as detailed. He'll scribble something down on a piece of paper, but Mike Brown is very scripted, very attentive to detail at practice, right to the point with everything. Those are the things I learned and carry over from Mike. Most of what we want to do offensively and defensively, being more demanding, comes from Sloan -- and the disciplinary side of things. I think it's a pretty good mix.

In a now infamous oped column in the New York Times, Romney argued in late 2008 that President George W. Bush and Congress should deny General Motors and Chrysler the bailouts they were seeking, because the money would go to waste. Only bankruptcy, with government guarantees of financing after the process, would turn the companies around, Romney wrote.
From San Francisco: Take Highway 101 north over the Golden Gate Bridge to Exit 442 for Alexander Avenue. Take that exit, turn left and drive under the highway, then curve south to Conzelman Road, signed "Marin Headlands Coastal Route." Turn right (west) on Conzelman. In a short distance, there's a turnout at Battery Spencer for a great lookout on the Golden Gate. Drive on Conzelman to Hawk Hill, then continue west (the road becomes one-way) toward Point Bonita. At Battery Wallace, continue a short distance to Field Road. Turn left and go a short distance to trailhead parking above Bonita Cove for Point Bonita.

double-overtime thriller was not the game you would have expected if you had scanned the South Central A.A. standings and stats at the start of the evening. Hancock (9-11) and Valley Park (2-18) were at the bottom were at the bottom of the league standings and at the end of the list in offensive production.

But McCoy had also run out of the pocket on the play. He was a ballcarrier then, a threat to run before flipping a short pass to Montario Hardesty. Harrison's helmet-to-helmet shot was obviously a penalty, but there is also the question of what he was supposed to do? Back off? Brake his momentum on a potential stop against a player who had scrambled to the lip of the goal-line earlier in the game?

And, of course, there's the tea. If you want to get all British about it, you can fuss with the exact timing and temperature, to make sure you extract the maximum flavor (and minimum bitterness) out of our fancy cut leaf brew. But if you're a layman, just aim to have the tea (and its waiting pot) nice and hot, and not over-steeped. Milk and sugar are optional but recommended.

The Packers went down and scored what proved to be a huge touchdown that gave them an 11-point lead. The key play was a 38-yard catch on third-and-10 by Jordy Nelson past Ryan Clark and around James Farrior. That set up an 8-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to Greg Jennings on a corner route past Defensive Player of the Year Troy Polamalu, who thought he was going to see the same route up the middle Jennings ran earlier.
Some cavers say these restrictions could be unnecessary. In congressional testimony on White Nose, Peter Youngbaer of the National Speleological Society said last year that cave closures had cost areas that host caving conventions thousands of dollars, while students have been unable to pursue cave studies. Youngbaer pointed out that, given the lack of understanding about where the fungus comes from, these measures could be futile.

Every one of these episodes has a back story that could file a column or two all by themselves. But most people never see more than the broad-brush descriptions of American actions. Obama could better manage his image, at least, because in politics and foreign policy, perception is at least as important as fact.

The Cardinals believe it an accomplishment that they retain one lefthanded reliever, Marc Rzepczynski, and several resulting draft selections as a dividend from the three-team trade that sent Rasmus to the Toronto Blue Jays last summer. It is a strange metamorphosis regarding a player who moved numerous analysts to write highly of him before and during his first two major-league seasons.

This is a soft, fruity, easy-to-drink, crowd-pleasing red with blackberry and raspberry flavors and a hint of vanilla. It's a medium-bodied red that's not very complex, but I often prefer simple wines with simple meals. It would make a good pair with such weeknight fare as pizza, pasta and ground beef casseroles. In fact, I thought it was a great complement to the "All American Flame Grilled" Boca Burger I threw in the microwave. It's amazing how a glass of wine can turn even a veggie burger into a classier kind of meal.
That's far short of Minneapolis-St. Paul International at No. 5, but then again we didn't have the additional publicity of a U.S. Senator dealing with wide-stance issues in the men's room.
If the federal government is serious about cutting the deficit and restoring fiscal sanity in Washington, modernizing our currency by switching to the $1 coin is a good place to start. We can no longer afford to bury our heads in the sand and ignore years of advice from the GAO just because it's "easier" to do things the old way. A viable $1 coin program puts us on the path toward a stronger, more vibrant economy.
So did millions of defense industry workers and their cars. And, soon, Southern California's contribution to American cuisine -- fast food. Including, eventually, hundreds of Carl's Jr. restaurants. Karcher died in 2008, but his legacy, CKE Restaurants, survives. It would thrive, says CEO Andy Puzder, but for government's comprehensive campaign against job creation.
"Prop. B is a plan that is detailed and has had numerous legal and financial assessments to validate it," said DeMaio, a lead author of Proposition B. "Filner's plan is full of talking points without real financial forecasts."
Recent reports of Claiborne's low Wonderlic exam score have created only a blip on his pre-draft radar screen. He's still expected to be the first cornerback taken and is widely regarded as a top 10 pick. That's because the tape of Claiborne at Louisiana State shows an instinctive player with a high football IQ and good man-to-man cover skills.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, Walmart neighborhood grocery stores, in contrast to larger Walmart stores that carry clothing, auto supplies, electronics and other products, have received approval to open in vacant buildings in Pleasanton, San Ramon and Hayward.
"One of the negative things about some American players is they don't talk as much as they should on the field," Spencer said. "Jack has that voice that we need in the middle of the field."

Louis this month. Prince Albert II of Monaco and his fiancée, Charlene Wittstock, made our town an early stop when they visited the U.S. on vacation. Who'd have guessed, right? Albert and Wittstock, a willowy blonde who formerly was an Olympic swimmer from South Africa, were here on a private and unofficial visit, his hosts made clear. It was the prince's third visit to St. Louis, where he has a good friend in Dr. Robert Munsch, an ophthalmologist who has his main practice in Hannibal, Mo. It was Wittstock's first visit here. Munsch hosted the visit with help from family and friends.

Neither Duck player was available to the media on Tuesday, and they might both be thankful for that, because I have a feeling the media would have blasted them -- especially Thomas -- after the video of Harris' traffic stop was released by KATU Channel 2 in Portland.

"In 1849 more than fifty vessels entered the Columbia to take wheat, farm produce, and lumber, for some 100,000 Californians who could pay handsomely for Oregon exports," historian Dorothy O. Johansen wrote in "Empire of the Columbia." "... Farmers who stayed home and women and children who farmed while their men went to the mines, accumulated tidy fortunes. ... As early as January, 1849 ... $400,000 in dust had reached Oregon."

“I think it’s a great idea,” Walter added.
To give an example of something I'd call reasonable, take a statistic that I dug up a while back. A couple of sources put the rate of premarital sex among American adults at 85% to 95%. And because birth control can be imperfect, sometimes unready couples conceive. And sometimes these couples decide that despite their unreadiness as a couple, they like each other enough and want children enough to want no part of abortion or placing their child for adoption. So, they step forward gingerly into the business of being a family.

Throughout the United States, a potentially lethal war is erupting. It is a war that puts millions of innocent lives in danger and undermines the centuries-long sacred bond between physicians and patients. This is a war between pediatricians and patients and has developed largely because of the anti-vaccination movement. As a public health student at Johns Hopkins University and a future pediatrician, I am alarmed by the catastrophic consequences this conflict could have on the health of American children.

A: This is one of my pet peeves, but also comes with a respect that the Pat Riley defensive system has been overwhelmingly successful over the years. Basically, the approach is to pack the paint, load up to the side of the court where the opposition has the ball. That said, it is remarkable how far the entire league has gotten from simply guarding your own man. The move away from hand checking and ban on perimeter contact has essentially forced the scrambling. Still, that is no excuse for what happened at the end of regulation Thursday.

After taking VCU from the First Four to the Final Four last season, Smart signed an eight-year contract last spring worth about $1.21 million a year. The buyout on that deal would be $800,000 this year for Smart, who guided the Rams to 29 victories and the round of 32 this season despite losing four starters.

But Reid's plan was already being privately rejected by Republicans concerned that the cuts it contains would prove illusory, particularly $1 trillion or so in savings claimed by troop cuts in Iraq and Afghanistan over the coming decade. Reid counters that House Republicans claimed the same savings windfall when they passed their budget earlier this year.

To the contrary, vintners in such nearby wine valleys as Sonoma and Napa discovered early on that Suisun is quite capable of producing fruit on a par with their own. They grabbed it and then blended the juice into wines that ultimately bore such appellations as "Sonoma Valley," "Napa Valley" and "California," with no prominent recognition given Suisun Valley.
He was addressing those traditionalists who balked at his audacious fusion of church music, hip-hop, roughneck R&B and mainstream pop. But it was also a warning to those who expected that his enormous crossover success would dilute his missionary message. Franklin was throwing a "Holy Ghost party," and everybody was invited.
On occasion when leaving my branch library, the alarm goes off. I just show my receipt and continue on my way. Technology is not perfect and the demagnetizer may not always scan perfectly. I certainly prefer having this system to prevent theft of items. I hope all the libraries will continue to use their anti-theft systems or install one if they don't have one. Our resources are limited and we can't just allow stealing from the public to go on.

Guest conductors for the season as usual run the gamut. A Charles Dutoit specialty is Berlioz, and he has chosen the dramatic symphony "Romeo and Juliet." Leonard Slatkin will premiere a work by Wynton Marsalis for jazz band and orchestra, another Philharmonic commission.
It strikes me that it's time for technology to start disrupting education. I'm not calling for the abolition of schools. My wife and daughter are public school teachers and I am the beneficiary of 20 years of public education with three degrees from state universities, including a doctorate in education. If anything, I want to see more resources going into education.

The White House did not comment on the implication that the lawsuit was somehow tied to its continuing sniping with Fox News or News Corp. Commission officials denied any connection and said it was not uncommon to proceed with lawsuits on narrower grounds than those of the initial complaint.
"Enhance Fitness" followed a similar format, but at a slower pace tailored to seniors. The equipment was slightly different, too. In addition to the fitness ball, we used resistance bands and leg weights for strength training, and again, I was pleased by the workout's effectiveness.

And, 20 years after he ran an "It's the economy, stupid" campaign against an incumbent president, Clinton focused his remarks almost entirely on the economy, laying out directly how, in his view, Obama has taken an economy in a state of collapse to a point where the country is now "beating the clock" in terms of recovery.

Abstentious wine lovers will appreciate the fact that the grape juices from Navarro, an Anderson Valley winery, come in Alsatian-style tall, narrow wine bottles, with synthetic corks to boot. Navarro offers deliciously complex, though slightly sweet Gewurztraminer grape juice, Pinot Noir grape juice as well as a Chardonnay verjus ($11 per 750 ml bottle) -- the latter is more for cooking, though some people do drink it. You need to order them direct from the winery for shipment in one business day to the Bay Area. Contact Navarro at
Children are not immune to the ravages of skin cancer. In fact, 80 percent of the sun damage to your skin is done by the time you are 18 years old, and a blistering sunburn before the age of 10 will double the likelihood of developing skin cancer by adulthood. So be sure to take steps to protect your children from the sun's harmful rays.

Giving someone a Barolo is like dropping an infant prodigy on their doorstep - frustrating to handle as a baby, but destined to bring you exquisite happiness one day. Devoted Nebbiolo initiates know this, which is why they'll begin to drool when you hand them a tastefully wrapped (or fully unwrapped) bottle of 2001 Bartolo Mascarello Barolo ($99, San Francisco Wine Trading Co.), made by perhaps the most militantly traditional of the Barolisti. Like many 2001s (or 1999s), it will take five years or longer - much longer - to really be drinkable. If your recipient is impatient, consider the 2000 vintage, in which the wines had slightly softer edges. Or hunt down an aged Barolo - more are now being shipped straight from winery cellars, a great deal considering that the winemaker did the aging for you.

Perry's time at the RGA — which he chaired in 2008 and again this year until he announced his presidential bid last month — proved lucrative for all involved. Both the RGA and its counterpart, the Democratic Governors Assn., can raise unlimited contributions from individual and corporate donors, allowing them to direct large-dollar donations to embattled governors.

Mr. Helwig, who is awaiting trial on related assault charges, declined to comment further about the matter. He has pleaded not guilty.

"This neighborhood has always catered to immigrants," says Jackson. "There were the Sephardic Jews in 1656, then the French Protestants, the Huguenots, in the late 17th century. In the mid-19th century, the Irish came to escape the potato famine, and then there were the Jewish emigres from Eastern Europe. Today's immigrant population is predominantly Bangladeshi, but now they're moving on."

Clowes' breakthrough came with "Ghost World," the comic about two hyper-critical teenage girls searching for authenticity in a fake-retro cityscape, published in book form in 1997. The 2001 Terry Zwigoff film, starring Thora Birch and an up-and-coming actress named Scarlett Johansson, earned both Clowes and Zwigoff an Academy Award nomination and vastly expanded Clowes' audience. Although the 2006 film of "Art School Confidential" did much less well, it was a time of growth for non-superhero graphic novels in general.

The room was 120 euros, or about $166 — 30 euros less than the lowest rate mentioned in the guidebook. Prices included a buffet breakfast in the same splendid dining room. But after our stay here in a relatively busy season, I noticed midweek winter rates as low as 80 euros on the hotel's website. In other words, at Bussaco, you can live like a prince at a price that might interest an upwardly mobile pauper.
Still, change can be slow, especially about hot-button topics, such as premarital sex and homosexuality, both of which are considered haraam, or forbidden.

Capalbo sings the part of Leonora in the production, a role she has taken on before. It's one of the best jobs in opera, but not exactly a happy one. Like a lot of Verdi's women, she's doomed from the start. Not that Capalbo minds; a soprano gets used to a gloomy exit.
Gov. John Kitzhaber announced a starting figure of $5.56 billion for K-12 funding for the next biennium, a decrease from the current biennium's spending level.

The world's most famous wave is the subject of songs and movies. Pipeline is unique for unfurling perfect liquid tubes just a few yards off the coast. It all looks so smooth when a surfer seemingly gets covered up and then blasts out of the tube at the end. But others never emerge standing from the aqua avalanche, while the unluckiest are rolled up the side of the wave, flipped in the air and pummeled into its shallows. Surfers talk of the beautiful "green room" of standing in the tube when the waves are big enough that they don't need to crouch. To find it, take the Kamehameha Highway east out of Haleiwa until you get to Ehukai Beach Park. Park nearby, then walk from the lifeguard station about 100 yards to the left. You are in the surfing equivalent of baseball's Wrigley Field or football's Lambeau Field.

An American Spectator article in 2010 by Janice Shaw Crouse explored why such a large portion of African American boys aren't graduating. Poverty and the lack of a father at home are huge factors. Noting that poverty is one of the largest factors for dropping out of school, as Oregon's numbers back up, the article reminds that poverty is much more of a single-parent-home problem. Crouse writes, "Thirty-seven percent of single moms and 17.5 percent of single dads are in poverty, whereas only 6.7 percent of married couples are in poverty. ... Even worse, now the poor children in single-parent households constitute almost two-thirds of all poor children."

What I have found and what continues to draw me back is the strength and vitality towards life most fully enacted during these pilgrimages. Haiti is a land that sits precariously at the edge of existence. What survives here does so by brute necessity. Nothing is left to waste. And this is a religion made of flesh and bone. It is a living force that continues to root the people to this very unstable earth.

Women, on the whole, get more sleep and fall asleep faster than men. About 30% of women said they sleep eight hours or more on weekdays, compared with 22% of men, according to the National Sleep Foundation's 2005 Sleep in America Poll, which surveyed 1,506 people. A small study looking at the sleep of healthy young adults found that women slept an average of 7 hours, 43 minutes in a night, or 19 minutes more than men. And women took 9.3 minutes on average to fall asleep, whereas men took 23.2 minutes. The study, published in the journal Chronobiology International in 2005, followed 16 men and 15 women—a small but not uncommon number for sleep studies—over three nights in a sleep laboratory.

A: Yeah, stumbled upon it, yeah. I was preparing for "Fear and Loathing," and we were in the war room (at Thompson's house) looking through boxes for the manuscript of "Fear and Loathing," which included, like, cocktail napkins and cherry stems and bandages, and all the weirdest stuff in the world. Suddenly I happened upon this other box that I broke open and, right on top there, stuffed amongst these papers, was "The Rum Diary." And we started reading it, the two of us, cross-legged on the floor. And I said, "Hunter, you're insane, man, this is (expletive) great writing. You need to publish this. I don't care when you wrote it. Let's publish it."
On Monday, the supervisors questioned how Noguez's figures could change so drastically.

I don't think anyone who comes out that early is ready for the pros. What bothers me is everyone wants to blame the kid, but you put that kind of money in front of him, what's he supposed to do? If the NBA has such a problem with it, don't draft him. And are we so hypocritical that we can send a man to Afghanistan in the Army at any age, but there's a concern for an age limit for the NBA?
An Eastern Oregon man has been transported to the Oregon Burn Center in Portland following a propane accident.
Egypt's foreign-exchange reserves have dropped to $15.1 billion at the end of March, raising speculation that the central bank won't be able to support the Egyptian currency much longer.

If the operation is successful, it is worth the risk and expense. Fortunately, this happens only rarely after spaying cats and dogs. But ectopic, or developmentally misplaced ovarian tissue - rather than the surgeon leaving some of the ovary behind - can be the problem, and this may be difficult to locate during exploratory surgery. It is worth a try, though.

Pujols did it again. This time it was a two-run homer that was estimated at only 406 feet. His first was called at 423 but that seemed short. He is the 10th player to hit homers in consecutive innings in a Series. (Babe Ruth did it twice).

If our scholarship in the classroom is not engaged with the realities of the world today, our teaching will not make the generational impact we desire. You know the realities: Christianity growing in the global south, de-Europeanizing of American Christianity, aging populations all over the world, decline of literacy making ours an increasingly oral culture, disregard for institutions, lack of belief that there is absolute truth, and all-in-all postmodern, post-church America, whatever you choose to call it. I don't think many in our church are engaging our inherited theology with culture as it is today. Many are as my friend describes it, saying his church has an answer for any question that arises...in 1953 . . . .

This is especially relevant as we compete in a world economy fueled by an increasingly knowledge-based work force. The foundation for these fundamental skills is set in the early school years. Yet America appears ill-prepared, as more than 20 percent of U.S. workers are unable to read at the most basic level or complete simple addition. Ohio high school graduation rates for incoming freshman are at 79 percent, and at 63 percent for Cleveland, where many low-to-moderate-income families have trouble affording preschool without assistance.

* Reduce the need for the newly expensive emergency inhalers by using maintenance drugs as instructed. Earlier this year, many asthma patients took a hit to their wallets when the Food and Drug Administration retired older inhalers and required a delivery system that's safer for the environment. Unlike some older versions, available as generics for $5 or $10 per prescription, the new versions can cost as much as $60 per prescription.

Hey, Hoynsie: I am a little perplexed regarding MLB and Indians' reaction to the Fausto Carmona/Roberto Hernandez Heredia situation. From what I have read so far, no one has condemned what he has done. Instead of voiding his contract or "blacklisting" him, we hear about Indians trying to help him come back to the United States. He has done something illegal and he should be banned rather than be allowed to join the team (whenever that is). What kind of an example does that set for others who may think of doing something similar in the future? -- P.D., Cleveland
