That’s a shame, because a program is clearly needed – and there are lots of imaginative programs out there that work in school districts across the nation.

For Beijing, the issue is sensitive because Chen enjoys broad sympathy among the Chinese public for persevering in his activism despite being blind and despite repeated reprisals from local officials.

A: I think probably the most enjoyable part is being able to see students. No matter where I go in town, I hear "Hello, Ms. Lee, do you remember me?" Some of my students are now in their 40s so it makes me feel real old when I hear that. Living in the town where you've always taught, you're going to see all these kids and I've watched them grow up and its amazing, they still recognize and remember me after all these years. They still think I look the same, bless their hearts.

"Kaptur will present herself as someone who knows how to work within Congress to get things done," Sutton said. "Kucinich's weakness is that he has tended to be a lone wolf.

Expect “Toy Story 3” to win in its animated-film category instead, and this to come down to “The Social Network” and “The King’s Speech.” But who has the edge? Traditionally, Academy members have voted for films that end on an upbeat note, which would favor “The King’s Speech”; recently, though, they’ve given the nod to bleaker films like “No Country for Old Men” and “The Hurt Locker,” which would bode well for “The Social Network.” So who will win? In the end — like all of this — it still comes down to a hunch.

The idea is to show people how easy it would be to not eat meat one day a week by offering seasonal recipes, from a spring ragout of artichoke hearts, broad beans, peas and turnips to a leek and ricotta tart. More an environmental conversation than a vegetarian one, the book draws its inspiration from the Meat Free Monday campaign that McCartney, her father and sister Mary launched in London in 2009 in an attempt to bring light to the detrimental effects of the agricultural industry.

Some of these influences show up in my first book, "Re-Bound: Creating Handmade Books From Recycled and Repurposed Materials" (Quarry Books, 2009).

How do we protect people from themselves? This has been an issue in San Francisco since I was a child. At what point is society responsible for the acts of the individual?

Do we put everyone in bubble wrap and Kevlar suits to protect them?

When Bubba Starling was a kid, his parents didn't believe in video games. They didn't want him inside all day just lying around. They'd say, Go outside, pick up a football or a ball, do something, Bubba, 18, says. How smart do Jim and Debbie Starling look now? A senior at Gardner-Edgerton High, Bubba is considered the sixth best high school quarterback in the country. When it comes to a dual threat, a quarterback who can pass and rush, he jumps up to No. 3. Ten Division 1 schools courted him before he even started his senior year. He's made a verbal commitment to Nebraska (where he would play football and baseball). Around Gardner, in Johnson County, he has movie star status, where little girls want their picture taken with him. Through it all, Bubba shrugs a little and smiles a lot.

Shhh. You're going to the library. The big one on 5th Street, with the strange pyramid on top that deserves a role in the next overwrought Nicolas Cage conspiracy movie. Don't be put off by the street people at the entrance or the low ceilings on the ground floor. Climb one level and behold the soaring rotunda, full of spectacular murals painted in 1933 — conquistadors, friars, Native Americans and European settlers, not to mention the globe chandelier that throws light on them. Then step into the Children's Literature room next door, where (above the low-hanging fluorescent lights) you'll find another set of California historic scenes. Now follow the advice of Monica May, chef at the Nickel Diner and a downtown veteran, who takes visiting friends here and orders them to sniff the books. Why? "You're smelling your childhood," she says. After those acres of quiet, expect a blow to the head when you step through the glass doors of Bottega Louie Restaurant and Gourmet Market at Grand Avenue and 7th Street. That's how it feels the first time you confront the restaurant's signature din, the roar of a few hundred diners and a revved-up sound system, all bouncing off marble floors and empty whitewashed walls, echoing under 40-foot-high ceilings. But give it a minute, and notice the gleaming green éclairs for $3, the gluten-free macarons for $1.75, the legions of chefs in the wide-open kitchen. Since opening in 2009, this eatery has won a reputation for genial service, good Italian food and reasonable prices. It's so noisy that no one will notice a garrulous child. And if you don't want a meal, there's always the bar in front or the desserts in the bakery. No reservations are accepted, so arrive early or expect to wait.

"We all agree that we need to improve billing accuracy and customer service right away, but I can't support a moratorium because our bond experts have warned that it could hurt the City's credit rating — which could hurt paying customers and make it even harder and more expensive to upgrade our water system," Rawlings-Blake said in a statement.
Suffice it to say, the men and women who work in the field have all seen gruesome things. Sometimes they can see a whole story, a crime from beginning to end, in what's left behind after police, paramedics and medical examiners move on.

Since the magazine published the interview, Huckabee's remarks have attracted considerable attention on the Web.
Even before the coming of replacement players, I had become disillusioned with the game. It was becoming as corporate as General Motors up the street from Tiger Stadium. Marketing began to dilute much of the game's purity. There was no gimmick too big, no gimmick too small. It all got down to money.
I liked the addition of the front-facing camera. We make frequent video calls to my parents in Texas, and it's nice to have that option on a Nokia Windows Phone device. The drawback is the software. The Lumia 900 ships with Tango, which is a perfectly fine video-calling application but not nearly as widely used as Skype or Apple's FaceTime. Fortunately, Microsoft does finally have a version of Skype for Windows Phone 7 in the works.

For several days after his ouster, censors took a hands-off approach to online gossip, letting speculation flow freely. That changed this week as popular microblogging site Sina Weibo reinstated an earlier block on searches for Mr. Bo's name and additionally blocked a wide range of user-invented code words for Mr. Bo, including the term "not thick"—a play on Mr. Bo's surname, which means "thin."

The first White House observance of Ramadan was hosted in 1805 by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson's well-thumbed copy of the Quran is now in the Library of Congress.

In the 1970s and '80s, grain processing began shifting overseas, where building codes and public health requirements were looser, and to U.S. factories that were easier for trucks to reach. The city bought the mill in 2000 for $7.7 million; the final owners left behind machinery, files, office equipment, old bills and more grain than you could eat in a lifetime. Much of that remains, ghostly, grainy hints of the days when American ingenuity ruled the world and Portland was known as an industrial hub rather than a cultural hotspot. It's no wonder Mayor Tom Potter and his City Council colleagues agreed to reconsider city plans for the mill in 2004, despite prescient warnings about the potential cost and logistical difficulties of any renovation. This is a branch of our history that we've almost lost entirely.
"Obviously MLB did. It caught me off guard," Perez said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press before Cleveland opened a weekend series at Oakland. "I can go through the union and I'm still waiting to hear back what my agent wants to do. It's not really about the money, it's about the principle. I don't know if I'm the first one ever. I'm getting the most publicity out of it. I don't want to just lie down and let them have full reign, because right now there are no guidelines, so how are we supposed to know? That's what I want to get out of it. If I crossed the line, fine, but what's the line?"

For my part, I do not just reiterate the biased points of either the liberal Old Media (the New York Times, major networks, NPR) or the conservative New Media (Fox cable, Internet, talk radio). I go with traditional absolute principles and take time to research various sources. Search engines on the Web uncover all the news, including that which the dying liberal Old Media stifles. I try to interpret my letters as readers might. Lastly, I think it’s a waste of time to personalize debate with pointless name-calling or personal attacks, even when rivals do.

Academic bio: EMO Academic All-Conference ... Principal's honor roll ... National Honor Society.
To address the deficit and the debt limit increase, Republicans are determined to cut government spending for the middle class, the teachers. They will not even discuss asking the most fortunate Americans, corporations, oil and insurance companies, the Pentagon and Wall Street to sacrifice along with the middle class and the poor.

Cacophony is one of the standard tropes by which we view Los Angeles, a city defined by its unknowability.

Wade keeping it real: The Miami Heat's plans seem quite clear. They are banking everything on the future and sacrificing the present.

Outlook: The Clippers look like a sleeper annually but have to overcome their culture and hard luck, like losing Blake Griffin last season. Griffin looks healthy and like a future All-Star on a team with past All-Stars Chris Kaman and Baron Davis. If Del Negro can reach Davis, and if Eric Gordon springs off his USA Basketball summer, there might be something there but many question Del Negro's in-game coaching ability.
No velvet rope here: You can almost always find a table, which is a relief. The menu is, for the most part, casual and impromptu. There's charcuterie and cheese, "bites" and, if you like, bigger plates too. Vinoteque stays open late and has a great wine program with an ever-changing array of wines by the glass. But to be blunt, the wines outshine the food, which is perfectly fine but not particularly exciting.

That's a killer for the Nuggets because they thrive off points in transition. With the Lakers able to slow the game by controlling the boards, their brawny bigs stole opportunities for Denver to keep the tempo at a fast pace. The Lakers outscored the Nuggets in second-chance points 28-18.
"A person should not be able to buy his way into the park and insist on one solution," he said, referring to Jacobs. "The precedent this sets is the fact that this is will not be a public but an advocate-submitted plan we're reacting to and having to choose to say yes or no."

In California, the margin of defeat for gay marriage decreased from 22 percentage points in 2000 to 5 in 2008. Gay-marriage supporters, who would probably win a referendum today in California, have sensibly concluded that another referendum is pointless if the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' invalidation of Proposition 8 is upheld. The first victory for gay marriage at the polls will probably come in 2012 in Maine, Washington, Maryland or perhaps all three.
But reclaiming its reputation as the lowest-prices leader is critical to sustain the improving sales trend.

The Cotes des Basques at the elbow where southern France meets northern Spain is the birthplace of European surfing and still one of the top locations. Hossegor on the French side of the border and Mundaka in Spain have hosted top-tier surfing contests. Hossegor is the place this year for the premier surf event in France. The area has been a famed beach resort since the early 19th century, when aristocrats flocked to the strand to get away from the summer heat in Paris, Lyon and Marseille. For a picturesque view, nothing beats nearby Biarritz. It was here, in the 1950s, that the French embraced a sport invented in Hawaii and popularized in California. One story has it that screenwriter Peter Viertel ("The African Queen"), who learned surfing in Santa Monica, wowed the Biarritz crowd with his surfing while visiting with his wife, actress Debra Kerr. Biarritz offers a regal stage for surfers, who compete against the backdrop of sunbathers arrayed on the Grande Plage (Great Beach) around the dowager queen of beach resorts, the Hotel du Palais, where Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenia summered.
