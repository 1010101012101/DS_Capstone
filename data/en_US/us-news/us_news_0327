After a few complimentary starters, the real meal begins. On our visit, the tasting menu started with two squares of toro, each topped with a froth of ponzu, a scattering of tender celery leaves and paper-thin slices of serrano chiles, matched with NV Heidsieck Brut Champagne.

Jack believes that the secret to being an agent is to read merely the first and last five pages of everything that comes in.

Fitzpatrick. He was surely kicking himself while watching the film today. Aside from the bad ball that wound up being Webster’s second pick, he also missed a wide-open Nelson two plays after Boley’s pass-interference penalty and then took a 9-yard sack on third-and-16 against a three-man rush. All he had to do was hit Johnson over the middle or WR Brad Smith in the right flat and the Bills are kicking a field goal for a 7-point lead instead of punting.

Proving that it's possible to echo both the girl groups of the 1960s and the Brit-pop of the '80s in the same amazing breath, Bird sets the tone for this bittersweet rocker with a sigh of "Go ahead and congratulate yourself," pining like Morrissey on a rainier-than-average Monday. Then the drums kick in, a snare on every beat like some old Motown hit, only to pull back on the chorus hook, where the "Be My Baby" beat meets wistful Beach Boys harmonies and Motown accents and Bird hangs his catchiest melody on the song's central premise: "You've done the impossible now/ Took yourself apart/ Made yourself invulnerable/ No one can break your heart/ So you break it yourself." And then, of course, there's a whistling solo. Because that's what he does.

The Freedom Leash by the Paws Republic is a great concept product with a few flaws.
The ruling stunned state and federal forest managers. A law firm representing timber companies said the court turned its understanding of the Clean Water Act "upside down." Private forestland owners worry their roads will be subject to more regulation as well. Oregon's political leaders want the ruling overturned.

When nearly 100 older women and men had their blood checked for key vitamins and fats, then took a thinking-skills test (some had their brain size measured, too), an "eat healthy" pattern emerged along with the best test scores. Those with higher levels of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and of vitamins B, C, D and E had the sharpest minds and most total brain volume. Those with the highest levels of trans-fats -- the nasty fats found in processed foods -- didn't fare as well.

I used to be a big proponent of the "it's-just-a-game" mentality. When my father would yell at the game on TV or my mom would cover her eyes and yelp, I was baffled.

A lot of people out there think that sports are a waste of time and money, that there are better things to focus on.
His brewing equipment is pretty simple. Hause uses a large brewing pot that he puts over a wood fire outdoors during warmer months. In the winter, it sits across all four burners of a residential stove. His beers are bottle-conditioned, meaning the yeast is added to the bottles, where they then ferment. Wilbur beers are sold in bottles at stores and restaurants in Morgan, Monroe and Marion counties. Two Bloomington restaurants carry Wilbur on draft. But Hause expects his beers will receive wider distribution next year.

The foie is cooked until practically liquified, then mixed in a Vita-Prep blender, strained, put in a bowl over an ice bath and whisked until it is thick and light  like a mousse. The temperature must be precise to get the texture right  flexible enough to pipe into molds and firm enough to maintain its shape. During the piping, warm hands holding the piping bag can ruin the texture, so the cook's hands are iced down before beginning the procedure.

Still, it's sometimes hard to tell what's a synth and what's a guitar since they're each so distorted and oddly employed. The track "In Absentia" mutates the synths and vocals into a heady blur. It sounds as if the tune were trying to claw its way out of quicksand. "Imago" features trampolines of synths bouncing around vocals from Cedric Bixler-Zavala that you could almost call (gasp!) pretty. That's an improvement over the last CD, where Bixler-Zavala's attempts to sound tuneful suggested Rush's Geddy Lee with his business in a vice.
Victims of wartime suffering here draw differing conclusions as to whether the losses they have borne should lead to a speedier pullout of U.S. and other foreign troops, and whether the banning of Western troops in rural areas, as President Hamid Karzai appeared to be advocating last week, would make things better. Maybe, they say, a precipitous pullback of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces would make everything worse.

"Think Like a Man" made a great debut. Everyone seemed to use “surprising” to describe the box office total. And Chris Rock recently said the film's resonance has little to do with the race of its cast. What do you make of how the film has been received and what it says about ... ?
All that basketball paid off. Buhl, a tiny Iron Range school, was synonymous with high school basketball prowess for a decade starting in the early 1930s.

Not to single out LowFares.com. The experts on the Bing Travel Fareology Team like the idea of sending summer travelers to Sin City, too, where the average high temperature in July is a blistering 106 degrees.

69. Trumaine Johnson, CB, Montana, 6-2, 204. A four-year starter - 45 starts in all -- who is one of the biggest cornerbacks on the board. Doesn't have the speed some of the other players at the position have shown, but consistently finds the ball finishing his career with a school record 36 pass deflections to go with 15 interceptions.

The way the government squanders our money is obscene, and it's too bad Occupy Baltimore won't get on the case. I plan to protest a similar boondoggle perpetrated by the State Department that's ripping us off. All the summer job J-1 Visas so generously available make it more profitable for an employer to hire a foreign student for a job instead of employing an American. This is called the Summer Work Travel Program, and anyone visiting Ocean City will notice the tremendous number of non-Americans waiting tables and tending cash registers. Thanks to the program's generosity, an employer doesn't have to pay into Social Security, Medicare or unemployment insurance. Talk about beach blanket bingo!

A pretty obscure place, too. Never mind the top 10 — go through last year’s top 50 and look for all the movies that didn’t depend on special effects, car chases or a dirty joke.

The SDA, identified as "solvent through March of 2010," is among several authorities flagged as challenges for the new administration. The Highlands Council is called "a disaster on multiple levels," punishing landowners and local governments with too many layers of regulation beyond its mission of environmental protection.

I talked with Rick (Spielman), and obviously I have a really good relationship with Rick. I worked with him in Miami and I've known him for a long time, so we talked about what was fair.

The New York Times called the book "powerful work of reportage" that renders Italy as "an utterly unrecognizable place": "There is no Renaissance art, no leisurely lunches or bustling piazzas, no world-class design, no achingly beautiful landscapes.

Taylor, 15, Santa Rosa: You could be my own mom! My eighth grade class had only five students. Starting high school was a big adjustment, but much less scary after the first day.

We're sure you'd probably never swig that much soda (right?!?), but teens average 73 grams of HFCS a day, and most people take in about 55 grams, mainly from the HFCS in sweet drinks, desserts and candy, which your body absorbs in a flash. The fructose in fruit, by contrast, gets absorbed slowly and safely. (Side note: HFCS also might contribute to obesity by interfering with "I'm full" brain signals.)

The federal government now provides the bulk of student loans.Federal loans accounted for more than 90% of all student borrowing in the 2010-2011 academic year, according to the College Board. Nonfederal loans—including those issued by states, banks and credit unions—accounted for 7%. The government expanded its lending after the financial crisis drove up student borrowing costs. However, making federal loans easier to discharge through bankruptcy would be politically thorny, given that taxpayers would pick up the tab if those debts were shed. The Obama administration argues that government lends at lower interest rates than private lenders and is often more lenient about allowing borrowers to delay or adjust payments when they run into financial trouble. However, since the government caps how much money each student can borrow per year, many students take out a combination of public and private loans to fund their education.

Kathleen Parker of the Washington Post Writers Group attacks the tea party in her Aug. 2 Herald-Mail column, "Toss the tea party." She has added "Fragging" to the description of the tea party.

The purse-enhancement legislation stands out as a sensible, bipartisan compromise, developed through concern for the horse industry and respectful discussions on how to help it in a way that benefits many. It may not be as glamorous as a Vikings stadium bill.

It's still not right, but in that context World Peace's violence at least makes more sense than what he did last spring: nearly breaking teammate Odom's arm to run across and angrily deliver a flagrant foul to Dallas' J.J. Barea. That was non-competitive, after-the-outcome, sheer-jerk behavior … and it got Artest suspended for one playoff game. That Artest blow required reaching much farther out to make hard contact with Barea's face and neck than Bynum's jerk behavior delivered to Barea's side two games later.

Imagine a sequel to "Hairspray" about a group of kitschy art-school kids who form a band to open for an early Blondie show at CBGB. It's that good. Seth Bogart can't decide if he's Fred Schneider or the singer for the Groovie Ghoulies on the Shangri-Las-style monologue that kicks off "Lovers Lane." And "He's Coming Back" has the feel of the Brill Building classic (if Goffin and King had written songs for guys to sing about their boyfriends coming back).
The Pew study also finds New Jersey third among the states with the largest share of illegal immigrants in the work force, behind Texas and California, with illegal immigrants constituting about 8.6 percent of the Garden State's work force.
