“Dale & Tucker vs. Evil” is, as its title suggests, not a movie that takes itself seriously, as “Red State” and the recent “Straw Dogs” remake do. But in some ways it may be the most serious movie of all.

His greatest legacy is the City Museum, a fun house of discarded fire trucks, neon signs and mouse cages.

It's easy to dismiss Zbikowski spending this offseason in the ring as a lark or a way for him to keep in shape during the the NFL lockout. But he is as serious as a broken nose about his boxing career.

Computer consultant Jonathan Farnick of Woodstock is back for another try. He ran as a write-in in 2006 and lost, filed again in 2008 but withdrew, filed again in 2010 and was removed from the ballot for lack of signatures. He was drawn to politics because he objected to then-incumbent Rep. Melissa Bean's tendency to cross party lines – one of her best traits, in our opinion. Farnick's opponent in the Democratic primary is first-time candidate Dennis Anderson, 61, of Gurnee. A retired public health worker and medical research administrator, his positions on the issues are far more nuanced than Farnick's. Anderson is endorsed. The winner faces Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in November.

The plan would allow investors who wish to sell all their holdings in a money-market fund to receive only 95% to 97% of their cash immediately and the rest after 30 days.

European nations, which became the first to commit to the IMF fundraising effort in December, have pressed other countries to help shore up the fund's resources.

Dallas acquired Vince Carter in the off-season, and I once again must cite The Vince Carter Rule: No team he plays on will ever win an NBA title. Fans sometimes forget his nickname, “Half-Man/Half-Amazing/Half-Baked.” The Mavs are Carter’s fifth team in 14 seasons; he could play for all 30 NBA teams over 50 seasons and still not win a league title.

"There are two big issues with government taxes," says Michael Miller, a vice president at the American Aviation Institute (aviationinstitute.org), a think tank that often takes industry-friendly positions. "First, the total amount of taxes is higher than (for) nearly all other consumer products. And second, the government keeps adding to the consumer burden, never replacing older taxes. New rules hiding government taxes from plain view on your ticket price make it even easier to add new taxes."

And though such traditional U.S.-Chinese issues as human rights will be discussed, the agenda centers heavily on economic-related issues, including efforts by both countries to spur global economic activity, the fallout from U.S. action imposing new tariffs on Chinese tire and steel exports, and recurring U.S. complaints that China has undervalued its currency.

The phrase "you can do anything you want as long as you work hard" no longer applies. What does apply is there are not enough entry-level jobs to go around and you are forced to take a job way below your skill level and education in order to make ends meet. There is a great deal of compression as people with significant experience consume the lower-level jobs, which used to filter down to new graduates.

Obama's call for increased spending on high-speed rail projects is nothing new. He's long seen the sector as an area of opportunity for creating jobs and improving the nation's transportation system. His administration awarded $10 billion in federal grants for high-speed rail projects last year, including $2.3 billion for California to begin work on an 800-mile-long, high-speed rail line tying Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area to Los Angeles and San Diego; and $1.25 billion to Florida to build a rail line connecting Tampa on the West Coast with Orlando in the middle of the state, eventually going south to Miami.

By FIFA's count Pele scored an astounding 1,281 goals in 1,363 matches over a 21-year career. If he's lucky enough to play 21 years and continues to score at his current pace, Messi will finish with a bit more than half as many goals.

And over the last three years, he's averaged a goal a game — all while playing most of his matches in Spain's La Liga, the most competitive league in the world.)

Perhaps it’s because Rolle has lost in a Super Bowl before (with the Arizona Cardinals, in Super Bowl XLIII). He’s gone through this process and come home empty-handed.

In 1966, Texas Western, a relatively small college of mining and metallurgy, stormed to the national collegiate men's basketball championship over Adolph Rupp's vaunted University of Kentucky Wildcats. It's a terrific story of a team of Davids with hoop dreams running a gantlet of patrician Goliaths against a backdrop of momentous social change. The Miners, led by Coach Don Haskins, counted an unprecedented seven African Americans in its lineup, including the starting five in the final game, and changed the sociological makeup of the sport, paving the way for the integration of the major southern collegiate sports conferences.

In the haze of shock, grief and recrimination that followed the destruction of Minoru Yamasaki's twin towers, rebuilding at the site, which quickly became known as ground zero, became one mantra America convinced itself we could rally around. But the process ground slowly toward gridlock: Daniel Libeskind wound up winning a high-profile master-plan competition for the site, then saw his proposal slowly gutted while he turned to designing condo towers for Sacramento and Covington, Ky. The memorial to the World Trade Center's 2,700 victims, by Michael Arad and Peter Walker, was also delayed and diluted; it is scheduled to open, at least in part, by 2011.

LOS ANGELES - Hulk, smash.
Brown in a phone interview after the press conference said he expected a “cordial” exchange because the last time they spoke, Christie “looked into my eyes and really appeared like he was listening.” Brown said he didn’t mean to appear disrespectful or threatening, but objected when Christie characterized his viewpoint as that of one student rather than the school community at large.
City officials say their plan is to enhance the historic, publicly owned properties — many of which have been badly neglected over the years — and turn them into profitable enterprises.

War, in Maddow's words, has become "frictionless" and painless for most Americans, except those actually fighting it, and she thinks it's way past time for a national debate about how we got here. Asked by Maher what she thought the Founding Fathers would make of this state of affairs, Maddow responded with the rapid-fire colloquial humor that salts her TV commentary.
Sound far-fetched? Plenty of skeptics, including a fair number on Wall Street, question whether any of this actually works. And even if it does, it would be Wall Street professionals who benefit rather than people actually using the sites.

With all the past raiding by the state government on the transportation trust fund to shore up Maryland's budget shortfalls, without detailing exactly what projects are in an emergency need to be fixed now, and why there is not enough money or why we can't put on hold the less important projects, I see no reason to raise the gas tax.

Travers apparently was under those same restrictions while working at an abbey in Virginia, but that abbey immediately cut ties to him in January and sent him back to Morris Township when church officials discovered Travers was ignoring the rules.
Dinner? It's hit or miss. The steak is fair. The risotto is edible, bordering on OK. So is the sea bass (served whole) if your preference is for doing all your own seasoning at the table. The braised lamb shank may have been the best meal we had, tender and and properly seasoned, suggesting that a modicum of patience and skill is somewhere to be found in the kitchen. I just know it won't be a lasting memory, like, say, the lamb at Boulevard Bistro.

Proulx's eye has some of the sharpness of Mark Twain's, and her prose -- at its best -- has some of his wit.

These mines are very predatory as they are coming into an economically depressed region of the state and making all sorts of promises about the jobs they will create. And I have no doubt that, were they allowed to proceed, they would create jobs. But for how long? And are we really willing to risk the pristine nature of the Boundary Waters and the safety of Lake Superior which is still recovering from the Reserve Mining fiasco for a decade of employment? Tens of thousands of Minnesotans currently make their livings off the tourism trade in Northern Minnesota. I have to believe that the tourism industry will suffer greatly if suddenly our land is ripped bare and our lakes contaminated with runoff sulfuric acid from mines run by people with the worst possible track records.

But Reitman briefly feared that the character might have come a little too close to reality.

One strong contender with a distinguished history is Franklin's Teleme, a runny cow's milk cheese made by Franklin Peluso in San Luis Obispo. The cheese hits the market when it is only about two weeks old and continues to improve for three to four weeks.

The tour boat driver stopped about 50 yards from a picturesque islet crowned by swaying palms. The lagoon was so clear that I had no trouble spotting three black-tip sharks circling near the boat. We would have to run a gantlet to get to the alluring white beach off the bow, but no one hesitated. I plowed ahead, wading through waist-deep water, keeping a wary eye on the three fins near me. There were 13 sets of legs and only three sharks. Not bad odds. Besides, the sharks were small.

Smith does a nice job with a very tricky, schematic character — an unreconstructed racist whose disdain for the hotel’s Indian staff transforms when she bonds with a maid over their shared life histories as marginalized domestic workers. Nighy and Wilton also work to deepen a potentially shallow depiction of the henpecked man joined to a shrew of a wife — in gesture and in tone, Nighy shows that he understands he’s failed to give her the life she’s expected, and Wilton shows us a woman who let disappointment turn to anger and reproach. In a crucial scene, we see the disintegrated couple remember being in love, and it’s a nice moment.

We’re told that “The Hunger Games” is an Orwellian takedown of brutal authoritarian governments, that it satirizes our obsession with television and fame.

Shurmur: "I think that what you do is, you pick them, you bring them in, you work with them and then you confirm what you thought and then you move forward. I think there are always some surprises. Who would have predicted that Jason Pinkston would have played every snap, picked where he was a year ago? That is why you pick the guys you like, that you think can make your club at the positions you pick them at. Now that we have chosen these guys, and there is reasons why, once we get them here and work with them, that is probably a much better question now, after we go through some of the practice time here in the spring."
Mr. Melentyev and Martin Fridson, global credit strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, say a reasonable expectation for total return on junk over the next 12 months is 7% to 8%.

The DVD was made without his cooperation, so it’s mostly left to music journalists and Eno’s former collaborators to explain what he was all about. But it’s still a documentary that fills a big hole. Many of rock’s great stories have been told so many times they’ve lost their charm, but Eno in the ’70s has been severely underdocumented until now.

Many of Laurie Berkner's groupies may still be in diapers, but they are as passionate about her music as any Springsteen fan. "I love Laurie!" squeals Ava, a precocious 3-year-old who has already been to two of her concerts and has tickets for her show tomorrow at Carnegie Hall (tickets are still available for the later performance). She'll bring her big brother, her mom, her dad and of course, a stuffed teddy bear "to put on my head when Laurie sings 'Pig on Her Head.' That is the best song ever."
Because in this development we received our annual end-of-season reminder that the general manager at One Center Court is always on softer footing than the players, coaches and owners. This is tenuous ground for Cho, as any of his predecessors, and also, the mascot might tell him.
A check of the Internet showed that 15 copies of the Bolingbroke book remain in existence, mostly in academic libraries. The survival of that many copies of a book that's almost 270 years old shows it was popular at the time. Library records show the society used to have two copies of the Bolingbroke book.

In many ways, more thought has gone into how to capitalize on the Olympics' high profile, afterglow and infrastructure than any previous Games.

Thompson also suggests sweetening lemonade with superfine sugar, because it dissolves more quickly than conventional granulated sugar. A simple syrup (made by boiling water and sugar) also is good.
TR: I've got two. I'm on that second one right now. It's a lot of stuff, especially being around guys like Mike (Matheny) and just the amount of information he shares daily. I can't get enough of it.

As logging industrialized, poor men became rich, and a rich landscape became poor. After arriving in America in 1852 as an 18-year-old German immigrant, Frederick Weyerhaeuser later controlled a logging empire valued at $70 million. Apart from canny purchasing of timberlands around the Great Lakes, his masterstroke was forming a syndicate of formerly rival lumber companies. By breaking logjams of wood being floated down the Mississippi, everyone's production improved; at the same time, cut land around the Great Lakes became a tinderbox. In 1871, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire seared 2,000 square miles and claimed more than a thousand lives. In the Badger State alone, more fires followed in 1891, 1894, 1897, 1908, 1910, 1923, 1931 and 1936. "Losing half a million acres in a year was almost commonplace," Rutkow observes.

The Battle of Madison: Assuming Gov. Scott Walker holds his Republican legislators in line, he eventually should prevail against Wisconsin's public employee unions. The question then will be the long-term political fallout. Many Republicans believe Walker's fight -- and the parallel battles being waged in Ohio and other states-- will energize their conservative base and appeal to middle-class voters whose wages and benefits were eroding even before the Great Recession. But Democrats are equally certain that any GOP victories will be Pyrrhic. They point to a new Gallup poll in which 61 percent of adults -- and 62 percent of independents -- say they oppose stripping bargaining rights from public employees. Democrats also believe the legislative battles and street demonstrations will rouse their faithful as attention turns to 2012.
In a statement Tuesday, Huckabee said that while he believes what people do in their private lives is their business, "I do not believe we should change the traditional definition of marriage."

But a 20-win season and a potential NCAA berth? That’s cause for excitement around Seton Hall, and if you don’t think so, we hereby offer some perspective: It beats having to go 5,500 miles to slay your final dragon, on the faint hope that someone will notice.
In came Stallings. Practice was in two hours, they had a team that could dominate the Missouri Valley, and he didn’t need this. If either of them knew of any assistant coach who kept his job after a DUI, the name eluded both. By all rights, Rice should have been put on the next bus, because Stallings’s staff didn’t need a 27-year-old fool destined for self-destruction.

TransCanada is moving ahead with the reapplication even though the Nebraska government hasn't officially approved a reroute yet.That approval is required under a state law passed last month. A TransCanada spokesman said the company feels there is general support from the governor's office and most of the state legislature for TransCanada's reroute plans, which the company has said are focused on a 100-mile reroute around the Sand Hills and the aquifer. Nebraska's Republican governor, David Heineman, and both of the state's U.S. Senators haven't taken a position on the new route, but they have pressed for a decision.

The monkey's hands were very soft, very velvety as they danced over my neck and shoulders. The creature was chattering gently, right next to my ear. Then it tugged. I tugged back. The monkey tightened its grip and pulled harder. Not exactly the story I'd planned to write: Padangtegal Ubud, Bali - Primate Garrotes Writer in Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. But there I was in the surreally mystical refuge of macaca fascicularis - the Balinese or long-tailed macaque monkey - being strangled to death by two little hands and four shiny strands of red coral.
