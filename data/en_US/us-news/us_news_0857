The cat was crisscrossing a deer trail ... in no hurry. ... By the time I had my dogs back on their leashes, the mountain lion had moved into the brush, out of sight."

Fifty to 75 percent of drunken drivers continue to drive with suspended licenses, studies show. So will people illegally avoid the devices or find ways to trick the device? Sure.

Dig into Mother Nature's medicine chest, urges Janet Brill, Ph.D., R.D., author of "Prevent a Second Heart Attack" (Three Rivers Press, 2011). Vegetables, especially dark leafy greens, are loaded with potassium that helps control blood pressure, and antioxidants and phytochemicals to fight heart disease and other illnesses. They may bring us more birthday candles, too: According to a 2009 report in the British Journal of Medicine, researchers who examined which components of the Greek Mediterranean diet had the greatest impact on longevity found a high consumption of vegetables was No. 3, just after moderate consumption of alcohol and low intake of meat. Go for variety -- eat all colors and all varieties often. They'll fill you up for few calories and increase your blood's total antioxidant capacity, helping to prevent dangerous plaque formation in your arteries, explains Brill.

In a genre not typically known for elegance -- typically, Ethiopian table service doesn't include utensils -- Bete-Lukas is a real standout, marrying a delicate take on traditional dishes with an assured presentation (the maitre d' and sous chef are, in fact, married). Thus the restaurant pulls off a neat trick, working as a gentle introduction to this fascinating cuisine for newcomers and as an inspired refresher for jaded palates. With its linen-covered tables and distinctive cooking, this is a rare treat -- and as upscale as Ethiopian restaurants get in these parts.

Super Tuesday, slimmed down to half its 2008 size but still doling out 437 delegates — about one-third of what's needed to win — probably won't settle much. It could nudge Newt Gingrich out of the race, or lend Ron Paul more credibility.

A close second in a state can pay off almost as well as first place.

"San Antonio has been after a team since 1992," McCombs said in a phone interview. "We will continue to stay after it until we finally prevail. The owners really like this 32-team league.

There comes a moment where you have to evaluate who you want to be as a man or a woman or a father or a son or a brother. That was the experience I wanted to capture in the movie."

Once again, the old road urged us to slow down and look around a bit.

What often happens after situations of extreme isolation is that the survivor tells everything all at once, and when there's nothing left to say, misunderstandings begin.
Compared with the wine list, the menu looks positively puny. It is a wine bar after all, and the dishes are designed to show off the wines without overwhelming or competing with them. I've always enjoyed Beltran's cooking, whether it was at his own place (long gone) or someone else's. But I suspect his food at Noir is closer to what he himself enjoys eating. Much of it is gutsy and direct. And right now, too, he's indulging a fascination with New Orleans.

Music can be a means of romance and escape, a departure from reality. But it can also be a way of staring reality square in the eyes. Few things are more real or intimate than being in the presence of someone near the end of his career who is confronting fate and mortality with candor, grace and courage.
The decision adds to a convoluted past with Adams on public safety issues. In May, Adams took control of the Police Bureau from Saltzman a week before Saltzman's re-election. More recently, Saltzman pushed to create dedicated funding for victims of human trafficking -- an issue Adams also began promoting. And Saltzman hasn't ruled out a potential run for mayor in 2012.

But the excitement over his country duets album also reflects Richie's deep roots - and remarkable success - in the genre. Richie wrote one of country music's enduring hits, Kenny Rogers' "Lady," and Conway Twitty's take on the Commodores' "Three Times A Lady" became a huge country hit. In addition, Richie collaborated with Alabama on "Deep River Woman," another song that became a country classic. So mix Richie's rich pop history with his country music legacy, and you can see why his return to his country roots on the new duets album "Tuskegee," named after his hometown in Alabama, is creating such a buzz in Nashville.

Last summer, the state decided to close 70 of the parks – about a quarter of the system – by July 1, 2012, due to a state budget that spends more than it takes in. Closing the parks would save the state an estimated $22 million.

Upholding her reputation as one of our most eclectic R&B stars-in-waiting, San Francisco singer-songwriter Meklit Hadero's latest project finds her playing lead in a self-proclaimed Ethiopian hip-hop space opera. Working with rapper Gabriel Teodros and producer Burntface under the collective name Copperwire, on its brilliant first album, "Earthbound," the group aims up to update the far-out grooves of Sun Ra and George Clinton's Funkadelic/Parliament through skittering club beats, lush strings and sound effects courtesy of NASA. The jazzy undercurrents of Hadero's solo work find their way into daring compositions like "Wake Up" and "Phone Home," giving the trio's unruly future funk the extra emotional kick it needs to send it into orbit.

I'm a big supporter of legal immigration, within reasonable limits. To those skeptical of immigration, I have often offered a demographic argument. Baby boomers, all 78 million of them – that is, 25 percent of our population – are beginning to retire en masse. They will subsequently begin to die off. We need to increase our legal immigration to help offset this loss.
2. In a similar vein, if you're tired and really, really don't want to be working on whatever it is anymore, just say so. It's infinitely wiser than plodding along and making negative comments under your breath while letting your anger build. Not that I've ever done that.

The proposed plug on the gold-sprinkled American River northeast of Sacramento has been declared dead many times since Congress authorized it in 1965, and there may be no reviving it now.

For a party that insists on loyalty, Fletcher's March 28 declaration of independence drew a swift and harsh response. The state legislature's Republican Caucus deleted his official assembly website. Tony Krvaric, the local party chairman, accused Fletcher of being a flip-flopper and issued a news release with Fletcher's face above these words: "He can't be trusted." The lawsuit, filed April 9 in small-claims court, is the probably the best example of how bitter the dispute has become.

Luger and Egelhof disagreed, concluding that the unit showed a "shocking" disregard for laws aimed at protecting individuals from unreasonable search and seizure.

I didn't just see the beauty of the area, I felt it.
Still, the higher profit numbers wouldn't have been possible without the bankruptcy. Last year, GM spent about $1 billion on paying interest on its debts. In 2009, it spent more than $6 billion on debt service. The 2009 figure is somewhat inflated by last-minute borrowing in the face of a global economic collapse. GM's typcial spending on debt in 2008 and earlier was in the $2.5 billion-to-$3 billion range.
