More importantly, the unruly nature of the Internet works against anyone trying to protect an old-media business model. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act didn't eliminate piracy when it passed in 1998, and neither the shutdown of Napster, the record industry's file-sharing nemesis, in 2001.
Editor's Note: Permit applications by opponents of the bear hunt were for three bear check-in sites — in Fredon, Franklin and Oxford — with varying numbers of protesters at each; the request was not for unlimited protesters at all check-in sites. The Fish and Wildlife Division granted permits for two of the sites, in Fredon and Oxford, and rejected the permit for the Franklin site; the division did not expand its permission for protesters at any additional sites.

Mourdock has spent months arguing that Lugar is not conservative enough for the right-leaning state, and he hopes to benefit from the split between the party's establishment and conservative wings. The challenger, aided by outside groups, also has tried to make the anti-incumbent argument, portraying Lugar as nothing more than a Washington insider.
"On the basis of the facts and evidence before the committee," the report said in one passage, "we conclude that, if at all relevant times Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone hacking, he turned a blind eye and exhibited willful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications."

Then, after a year of record-breaking heat and an almost complete lack of rain, winter rains broke records. Ponds filled. The grass turned green. Ranchers began looking for cattle, and many — along with analysts, feedlots and livestock dealers — kept a close eye on the GeneTrust auction held in the rolling hills of East Texas on a ranch owned by the Cavenders, a family more often known for selling boots and hats in western stores than cattle genetics.

Sahagún: Elizabeth Montes is known for her reverential use of intense and austere chocolates in candies that put the flavor profile of the chocolate front and center no matter what they're filled with. The hot chocolate ($5) at this tiny shop reflects that devotion. Made to order with seriously dark chocolate and a touch of milk, it's a dark and stormy brew indeed. Depending on the chocolate she uses, the drink can edge into bitterness -- you're essentially drinking a bar of high-percentage, single-origin chocolate -- so don't expect something sweet and gulpable.

Republicans vie for endorsements by prominent critics of illegal immigration such as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, and three Republicans hopefuls who resigned from the Legislature to run for an open U.S. House seat trumpet their cosponsorship of the Arizona legislation.
“The release of these documents creates an opportunity for reporters, academics, politicians, and others who relied on the IPCC to form their opinions about global warming to stop and reconsider their position,” wrote Joseph Bast, Heartland’s president. “The experts they trusted and quoted in the past have been caught red-handed plotting to conceal data, hide temperature trends that contradict their predictions, and keep critics from appearing in peer-reviewed journals. This is new and real evidence that they should examine and then comment on publicly.”
"The Republican myth is that the government is for the first time going to take over the health care sector," said economist Joe Antos of the business-oriented American Enterprise Institute. "The takeover was probably largely accomplished in 1965 with the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Since the early days, Medicare has called the shots on a lot of policy issues that private insurance fell in line with."

The Buckeyes' level next season will now depend a great deal on whether Thomas, another sophomore with an NBA decision, returns to Columbus. Matta said he is gathering information to help Thomas make "the best decision he possibly can." The feeling inside the team at the moment is that Thomas is likely to return because his draft stock now may not be where he wants it -- anything short of a certain first-round pick -- and coming back as the No. 1 offensive option next year would further his career goals.

Wildfires that destroy millions of acres of forest and land are rare today in Michigan because the state is cut up by roads and developments.

Openings: One of the riches of the local theater scene is the prevalence of small companies that may not produce shows on a regular basis, but apply evident thought and passion to those they do bring to the stage. Chief among such groups might be Sowelu Theater, which reappears with a production of “Vincent River,” by the British playwright Philip Ridley. It’s a taut, two-person drama that teases out the story behind the violent death of an East London man in a homophobic hate crime. Barry Hunt directs the reliably engaging Lorraine Bahr and Charlie Hamby starring as the victim's mother. Opens 7:30 Friday, continues 7:30 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays through April 21 (plus 4 p.m. Sunday, April 15), Theater! Theatre! 3430 S.E. Belmont St.; $18, $12 student/senior.

About the numbers: In an attempt to grade success, The Plain Dealer matched draft lists with a decade of AP All-Pro teams from 2002 to 2011.

The cons: I've seen people dismiss it as screaming, but I haven't heard him scream. I've heard him plead and wail and testify without missing a note. But screaming? I don't hear it.

I'm sad to say that in Sunday's edition of the series, he became the latest actor to do what is, to me, the most annoying scene an actor can do — a character is angry and slams a fist into a mirror, a door, a wall, whatever. It probably happens although it has never happened to me or anyone I know. If I were an actor and they asked me to break a mirror, I'd have to quit the job. Seven years of bad luck. No thanks.

And now, they’re all going to Indianapolis. The entire town is preparing to see them off: On this day, the phone rings constantly, and people come and go with updates on plans for videos and a big photo op (the townspeople assembled Sunday, all wearing their Giants jerseys). In the billboard down the Route 487, there’s a “Go Henry 45” placard resting above an ad for an amusement park; a mile away, the marquee at the Farnsworth Camping Center reads, “Good Luck, Henry.”

One Wall Street banker described the protesters as "a bunch of whiny people who are lazy or incompetent and have nothing to do with their time." He also said he was concerned the rhetoric could escalate to violence. "Who's to say they won't storm NYSE or throw something at the window of Goldman Sachs, that in turn inspires them to grab an investment banker and throttle him?"
Although we have had some very serious and in-depth conversations over the last six or so weeks about our future, including marriage and kids, and he assures me I am the one and he wants to marry me, he has yet to "pop the question."
The outlook, however, has grown bleaker as the nation struggles to recover from its worst economic crisis since Social Security was enacted during the Great Depression. In the short term, Social Security is suffering from a weak economy that has payroll taxes lagging and applications for benefits rising. In the long term, Social Security will be strained by the growing number of baby boomers retiring and applying for benefits.
So does Scott's budget fund only "core functions"? Probably not. One example is Scott's plan to spend $800 million in public money on economic-development incentives. You can debate whether that's corporate welfare or simply prudent investing. But it's hard to argue that incentives for business are a part of government's "core functions" — even more so because Scott himself has stressed his belief that government can't create jobs.
The facts in Mr. Currie's case have never been in dispute, and the Senate should not have waited so long to bring him to account. Now a jury has concluded that what he did does not amount to criminal activity — but it is still wrong. The public deserves a legislature that holds itself to a higher standard than legal guilt or innocence. If we are to have any confidence that Mr. Currie's conduct is not standard operating procedure in Annapolis, the Senate must act swiftly and decisively, and nothing short of his removal from the legislature and an overhaul of ethics laws will do.

As an evangelical Christian who believes the Republican Party does not have a monopoly on moral values, I believe this discussion is long overdue. The "compassionate conservatism" espoused by President George W.

"I think these three will be comfortable, whatever the scenario. Breanna, Morgan and Moriah are easy kids to get along with. All three of them are excellent passers and a lot of times being a good passer means having enough unselfish attitude."

Jim Carrey returns to broad comedy, playing an incurable cynic who makes a last-ditch effort to improve his outlook on life by agreeing to say "yes" to every proposition put in front of him. Suddenly he's playing guitar, learning Korean, bungee jumping and falling in love with a quirky waif played by Zooey Deschanel. Director Peyton Reed does his best to keep this outlandish premise grounded, but Carrey's mugging and Deschanel's mumbling prove to be impassable obstacles. The double-disc DVD and Blu-ray editions are also Carrey-heavy, focusing on his stunts and on-set antics.
“He just took everything so seriously,” Montanaro said. “He was just so intent on being perfect … and I think that’s why he became such a great coach.”

You can also see a more pointed message for the Chamber in another FlackCheck video below. Says the FlackCheck announcer, admonishing the Chamber: "The businesses you represent would never air an ad containing a deceptive photo of a competing product.

A meticulous researcher of the Italian sports cars, Roush took interest in Ferraris after seeing one on the cover of a 1958 magazine. While in college, he began collecting information about individual cars based on serial numbers.
øAnd boy, does that make all the difference. The Charger, as did many Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep models, got a makeover for the 2011 model year. But so many updates are arriving on 2012 models that 2011 is kind of a lost year. It almost seems as if Chrysler ought to apologize to buyers of 2011 models for giving them half loaves.
The Quinnipiac University poll usually tackles weightier issues such as approval ratings for public policy or politicians, but Hoboken’s decision prompted the latest poll question, Carroll said.
5. OLYMPIC PROVISIONS NORTHWEST (1632 N.W.

"There is a strong, strong push to profile," said USTA President Roger Dow. "But by profiling we're not talking about race or origin of country. We're talking about travel habits, past criminal history, all the things we know about people today, and an attempt to profile who is a very, very low-risk traveler and who is a higher-risk traveler."
Move over, the Ivy, and give way to "Nancy's" chopped salad, a tall pile of chickpeas, shredded iceberg lettuce, pear-shaped cherry tomatoes, aged provolone cheese, ribbons of finocchio salami and radicchio in a bright oregano vinegary dressing.

Deep down, I knew Kelli soon would master motoring. And I realized that independence comes with driving, which could drive my baby girl away from me. Pocketing the car keys, delaying her driving privilege would do no good. The drive to adulthood isn't something for which you can slam on the brakes.
Soaking isn't necessary with pearled farro; just give it a quick rinse in a colander. Then simmer the grains in water or stock like rice, or toast in a skillet and prepare like pilaf or risotto. Pearled farro will take about 15 minutes; soaked whole grains cook in about 40 minutes.

Why did she try to act that way? Bob asks her. "Because I'd been hurt a lot," Irene says, "I felt like if I was stoic, and didn't care about anything, then things wouldn't affect me as much." She adds, "I can't even believe how long I've gone through life just being numb, and that's not a way to live." She gets choked up thinking about how much her life will change when she comes back to Portland, and that's kind of scary."
Time slips away amid small cruelties, brutal assaults and a harrowing passage in which the soldiers use the women as shields during a raid on a Muslim enclave. In this scene, with her cinematographer, Dean Semler, Jolie manages the tricky feat of creating a chaotically violent vision, in which the focus remains intently on those who, in many war movies, are often an afterthought: the women.
That sound you just heard was the door officially slamming on the coaching career of Gregg Williams, the former New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator and current St. Louis Rams D-coordinator, who seems to see himself as some kind of headset-wearing mob boss, ordering "hits" on opposing players like he's John Gotti or something.

“I’m also struggling with this and troubled by it. We talk about appearance. This has a terrible appearance to me. You have an individual who’s working for two legislators, who claims he’s working for 80 hours a week for each of them, who in addition has an advertising/consulting business that renders services,” he said. It’s a nice arrangement. I had some very dedicated chiefs of staff and constituent service people but I don’t think anyone worked those kinds of hours.”
Mariano Rivera spilled out on the warning track dirt, clutching his injured right knee, writhing in pain. Just a moment earlier, he was chasing a batting practice fly ball in left-center field before he suddenly stumbled at the wall.
"Our Greater Cleveland community needed a break and we got one today," said Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a Cleveland Democrat.

By now, everybody who listens to the radio knows who Ke$ha is. She's the girl at the bar who is dressed outrageously to overcompensate for the shyness she feels in her daily life. She's a heck of a lot smarter than she looks, and if you step to her with any kind of pretense or agenda, she's going to see right through you. Oh, and yes, she's had a few too many.

What will make McGee most effective, in my opinion, is his ability to stay out of foul trouble and alter shots. The blocks are fancy, sure. But really, in the end, it's all about making other teams miss -- because often times some dude on the other team recovers a blocked shot anyway, whereas an altered/low-percentage shot means an easy rebound for the defense.

That was the case in 2003, with LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and (ahem) Darko Milicic on the board. Only Wade has won a championship among that group, and only Wade is still with the team that drafted him.

During a recent press conference, the mayor noted that the city has seen a drastic reduction in juvenile homicides by nearly 50 percent and shootings by 70 percent over the past four years. And in the past two years, juvenile violence and the rate of juvenile arrests have continued to decline. Faced with such positive results, now is not the time to retreat from the city's obligation to provide safe havens in the form of public recreation for our youth. Further divestment in our public recreation facilities could have the unintended consequence of reversing the hard work that has contributed to a dip in youth violence.

On the new album, Mr. Stuart and his band touch on many streams of what constitutes traditional country, the kind welcomed more by Americana music fans than those who consume what comes these days from Nashville's Music Row. "A Matter of Time" is a twangy country waltz with bite and "Truck Drivers' Blues" chugs along on the thwacks across a mandolin's strings.

The result? A quicker-built, stickier aerial orb web that could grab fast-flying insects without them breaking through or bouncing off the net. Gluey-silk spiders can make an orb web in 30 minutes, compared to the three hours it takes cribellate-silk spiders to comb out their webs. They can spend the extra time and energy foraging for food and avoiding predators.

"Throughout his stay at the embassy, U.S. officials consulted regularly with Mr. Chen to discuss his wishes. Mr. Chen made clear from the beginning that he wanted to remain in China, and that he wanted his stay in the United States Embassy to be temporary. He indicated that he placed priority on reunification with his family, and that he sought relocation to a safe environment elsewhere in China from the province that he's been living (in). He expressed his desire for assistance from the central government in addressing his concerns and grievances, primarily relating to his reported mistreatment and that of his family at the hands of local officials.

Hey, Hoynsie: Since the season has not started, does that mean the Indians do not have to pay Sizemore's salary until he actually returns? Could we void the salary altogether and save $5 million and trade/pay for someone now who could help the Tribe? I like Sizemore and feel bad for him, but by the time he returns (if at all) the season may be lost. If we can cut him now without paying him, we will save $5 million and have some money to get a healthy player. -- Joe Eversole, Pelham, Ala.
The allegations against Sandusky, who started The Second Mile in 1977, range from sexual advances to touching to oral and anal sex. The young men testified before a state grand jury that they were in their early teens when some of the abuse occurred; there is evidence even younger children may have been victimized. Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola said his client has been aware of the accusations for about three years and has maintained his innocence.

Betemit is the classic baseball cliche, the wunderkind prospect who never lived up to the hype. He was stuck behind All-Stars when he first made the majors, couldn't seize a full-time job when given the opportunity and then, in his late 20s, was pushed aside to make room for the next wave of wunderkinds.
La Russa answered flatly, "No," when asked if he'll ever manage again. He also said he had no plans to be a general manager, but said he is open to some sort of baseball job in the future.

The construction industry has been one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current recession, a downturn that occurred after a five-year boom in housing came to an end. However, in July, sales of existing homes rose 7.2 percent, the largest increase in at least 10 years, and sales of new homes were also up sharply, rising by 9.6 percent to the strongest sales pace since last September.

As talented as the musicians are, this is not a band for everybody. Although all four members take their turns at the microphone, no one is a strong singer. When they aren’t downright incomprehensible (see "You Enjoy Myself," which turns on a hook nobody can parse), the lyrics can be vague and mystical. And where other bands wrap up their songs after a verse and a chorus or two, Phish is just getting started. But that doesn’t mean that the songs just kill time between solos. Unlike many jamming bands, Phish refuse to hide their tunes, or their tones, behind walls of distortion and effects. Nothing is masked: They give you all they have, all at once. They know you can handle it.
"Their mission and ours are very much the same, making for a good marriage. They, too, are professionals with a passion to help compromised children,'' said Zlotkin, who believes, "Shelley would be proud of this dynamic association."
About 16,000 rooms were reserved at 100 hotels in the bay area. Delegates will stay at 36 hotels while RNC officials, the media and visitors will be assigned to the rest.

The 3-2 ruling means Jeremiah Hupka, 33, could return to police work. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to groping his ex-girlfriend. The justices said the crime occurred while he was off-duty, in a private home with a person he knew, and was not directly related to his sheriff’s position or his part-time job as a Frenchtown police officer. The law says an employee should lose their position if convicted of an offense "involving or touching such office, position or employment." But Sen. Thomas Goodwin (R-Mercer) and Assemblywoman Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex) say their legislation would allow a judge to consider the gravity of the offense, its context, the victim’s identity and qualifications required for the position.

That compares well to the average effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines, which, in a healthy population under 55 years old, are thought to protect against influenza infection between 70% and 90% of the time. The performance of the H1N1 vaccine is especially remarkable because the H1N1 virus emerged as a public health threat suddenly in April 2009, giving world health officials and manufacturers only a few months to design, produce and distribute the vaccine against it.
On Wednesday, BSkyB reported a 19% jump in net profit to £689 million ($1.1 billion) and a 5.1% increase in revenue to £5.08 billion for the nine months ended March 31.

Henry Whipple was an Episcopalian missionary who settled in Minnesota in 1859. At a time when Native populations were enduring extreme hardships and changes to their way of life, Whipple became an advocate for local Ojibwe and Dakota people. He was also an avid collector of Native American art and handicrafts. Long after his death, parts of Whipple’s collection were acquired by the Science Museum and the Minnesota Historical Society. After securing Legacy Amendment funding, these organizations partnered to build an amazing online catalog of 500 objects from the Whipple collection — representing everything from deerskin moccasins, bandolier bags, and hunting arrows to Episcopalian prayer books adorned by traditional Dakota beadwork. The site also features biographies on Whipple, his remarkable second wife Evangeline, and the various people they knew, including tribal leaders and accomplished Native American artists.
In an unusually wet week, an umbrella-toting completist in a city the size of St. Louis could see a different new movie every day. But this is a week that would float Noah's boat, with a deluge of new releases. Plus, there are special cinematic events, including the start of the free Italian film series at Washington University, a virtual vacation at the Salton Sea, and three more movie events: a visit from a celluloid Shakespearean, a film-fortified humanities festival and a one-night-only poker documentary featuring Matt Damon.
The picture was a hit, and in January she decided to test the waters with an expanded collection by creating a few samples and putting them on Etsy (etsy.com/shop/CatAtelier). According to Song, pet owners rarely think to style their cats, and when they do, there are so few options that they have no choice but to outfit their felines in ill-fitting dog costumes.
Guns are fired in the film, but not often, making the impact of the shots more meaningful. Instead of action, Alfredson builds tension through glances, snippets of dialogue, tiny details that add up to a bigger payoff. In other words, it's a film built on observation, the tool that these men employ in their jobs. Everyone is good -- Firth is a star, of course, and Hardy is always great. But Oldman's performance is amazing -- particularly considering that he doesn't say anything until about 20 minutes in and doesn't say a whole lot after that.

The other thing Democrats won't want to talk about are the actual income-tax rates they are proposing for the affluent. If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire, the top federal rate, combined with the tax increases in the health-care bill, will exceed 40 percent. Democrats don't want to explain why taking that much of the next dollar any American earns, regardless of how wealthy, makes sense in terms of economics or equity.

Coming on the heels of 21 beef recalls in 2007, this latest meat fiasco was followed by predictable and inadequate responses by apologists and critics alike. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials -- who, disturbingly, are charged with both promoting and monitoring our food supply -- trotted out the standard "don't worry, eat happy" line, even as they urged a recall. This signaled that our perilous game of meat roulette -- a $70-billion-a-year business with phenomenal clout in Washington -- would go largely unchallenged. Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society, criticized "the inadequacies of the inspection system. How can so many downers have been mistreated day after day within a USDA oversight system that was present at the plant? We need more boots on the ground at the plants." Some in Congress are calling for a fuller investigation into regulatory lapses.
In 1969, Schingoethe joined South Dakota State University as assistant professor of dairy science. He was promoted to associate professor in 1973 and to full professor in 1980.

The shallow, brackish water that makes up the creeks and swamps of the island are feasting grounds for migratory birds, Parsons explained. Sanibel, at just 5 feet above sea level, is home to more than 200 species of birds during the winter. The biggest is the white pelican, with a 9-foot wingspan. And the smallest: the hummingbird.
