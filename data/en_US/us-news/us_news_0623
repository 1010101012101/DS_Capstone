The list of headliners may not mean much to those who don't follow club sounds. But to fans of electronic dance music, the Electric Daisy lineup will sound like bass heaven. Most of the popular subgenres of EDM will be represented at the festival, including trance (Dutch producer Armin van Buuren, one of the popularizers of the style, will be there), European house (Swedish deeay Sebastian Ingrosso will spin at the Carnival), drum and bass and dubstep (Chase and Status, a floor-shaking UK duo, will export their raucous stage show to the Meadowlands.) There are mild overtures made to hip-hop, R&B, and even rock, but Electric Daisy Festival is best understood as advertised: a bold, unapologetic, synthesizer-soaked dance party.
"When her parents realized I did not speak Hebrew or English, they spoke to me in German," he remembered. "I asked myself, how can people who survived such a horror consider me a person?"
That Google otherwise seeks to collect and organize the world's information is a separate matter, though it does seem a Google-fluent adult citizenry could be of some profit down the line.

Last year's starters in Game 1 were Kamerion Wimbley, Eric Barton, D'Qwell Jackson and David Bowens. A year later, who would have guessed Bowens would be the only one to retain his status on the team? Wimbley was traded to Oakland, Barton's playing future is uncertain after a neck injury and Jackson's playing time could be in danger. With an emphasis on "position versatility," the names to watch are Matt Roth, Scott Fujita, Chris Gocong and Jason Trusnik. There are also three developmental LBs entering their second season -- David Veikune, Kaluka Maiava and Marcus Benard.

Barnes has a fixed menu of dinner salads, sandwiches and appetizers with entrée meals offered as specials served with a choice of soup or salad. We tried the meatloaf, $9.95, and the fish and chips, $11.95. The meatloaf, served with mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans, was hearty homestyle fare. It was good but served at a temperature that was a little too cool and had to be sent back for rewarming. The staff graciously offered a whole new plate.

In March, in a jury room just down the hall, another jury spent nine hours over two days deciding the fate of Timothy Bakdash, a Roseville man who had gotten heavily intoxicated and run over a pedestrian in a fit of anger; he would eventually be sentenced to 40 years in prison, roughly 10 times the maximum Senser could get if convicted.

With the Duncan trunk, the thought was the Cardinals have a lot of that info still available – though it will come via a different medium. Matheny said it: "our positioning and our pitch selection" will be aided by the analytics available. Chad Blair, the video coordinator who worked many years with La Russa and Duncan, remains on staff and will be essential to such advanced scouting. He has a keen eye for tendencies and weaknesses. The Cardinals also have an agreement with TruMedia, which describes itself as an "innovative sports analytics firm." TruMedia's programs will give the Cardinals access to film that can be sorted in new and immediate ways. If the Cardinals want to see, say, all the changeups that Tim Lincecum has thrown to righthanded batters this season, it's only one keystroke away. And the Cardinals no longer have to do the editing themselves. That's advanced advanced scouting.

Drive. Aim for somewhere, like Sedona or Saguaro Lake. Or aim nowhere. Stack the disc player with tunes that mean something to both of you - but play them low enough for you to talk. Establish some conversation laws - no work, children or family matters. Remember how you talked on your first date? Rediscovering each other is a lot more fun than a bouquet of overpriced roses. When you get back home, sustain the euphoria. I like St. Supéry Moscato ($11-$15 for a half-bottle) - light, delightful and slightly sweet (like you know who!).

What is most interesting about the first lady is that one gets the sense that she just wears what she likes, and that nobody on high is dictating what is "proper" attire for a first lady. She reportedly has a style adviser in Ikram Goldman, whose eponymous boutique in Chicago is a veritable treasure-trove of cutting-edge designers. But Obama was an Ikram client long before her move to the White House. She most likely began shopping there because those were the clothes that interested her.

And so manufacturing, to me, is the key to that. President Obama is all about equality of result. I'm about equality of opportunity. I'm not about equality of result when it comes to income inequality. There is income inequality in America. There always has been, and hopefully, and I do say that, there always will be. Why? Because people rise to different levels of success based on what they contribute to society and to the marketplace. And that's as it should be. And we shouldn't have a society that has a president who envies or creates class warfare or envy between one group of people and another. We should celebrate like we do in the small towns all across America -- as you do here in Detroit.

“One of the first thoughts I had when I came here was if you had discovered testing irregularities in the k-8 system, why should you assume it would automatically stop at the high school system?” Davis said in an interview. “I have no reason to believe there’s any systematic or pervasive cheating going on, although I have taken the appropriate risk-management steps to give me the assurance these things are not going on. I don’t want to leave it to good will or assumptions.”

I know firsthand this sort of thing can happen. I grew up in the shadow of the now-shuttered steel mills on the Southeast Side. Back in grammar school, a classmate's parents would take us to the then-Chicago Historical Society (now the Chicago History Museum). I couldn't put my finger on what was different, but there was an unfamiliar energy on the streets nearby that I really liked. "Some day, I'd like to live somewhere like this," I remember thinking.
øInflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has been exceptionally tame the past five years. The CPI has risen at a 2.3% average annual rate since 2007. TIPS funds have not only whipped inflation over that period, they have made it wear a clown suit and ride around in a tiny car. TIPS funds gained an average 7.2% annually in the same period, according to Lipper, which tracks the funds.
Most visitors to Newfoundland arrive in St. John's, a vibrant city of 100,000 that British travel writer Jan Morris described as "the most entertaining town in North America." It is also one of the oldest. Since 1497, when explorer John Cabot landed here, a steady stream of fishers, settlers and military types have left their mark on this port city that's built higgledy-piggledy on steep hills surrounding a punch-bowl harbor.

The Timbers have hyped Cooper, 26, as one of the final pieces to the team puzzle, a catalyst for their attacking style and – they hope – goal scoring. Portland head coach John Spencer hopes he is getting the Kenny Cooper that played for FC Dallas for four seasons before spending two seasons with a second-division team in Germany. That version of Cooper scored goals at a prolific rate – 40 goals in 90 games. Cooper scored 18 goals and was selected to the MLS Best XI (all-league) and an All-Star during the 2008 season.

When I first started traveling in Mexico, I got excited every time I learned I was near a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Fitzgerald went on to say that of course he's generalizing, and he knows plenty of humble coaches with offensive backgrounds. But the point is taken. While Fickell enters this season admitting he's not going to intrude too much on the offense, he's going through what a lot of Big Ten coaches experienced. Coming up as a defensive player and defensive coach, he's now running the whole show, but admitting his experience lies with preventing touchdowns, not diagramming them.

As before, a big part of what makes the film so effective and so scary is seeing everything through the eye of the camera (or cameras). Almost nothing is visible on the periphery, so it's harder to see anything coming. In a nice touch, Dennis rigs one camera onto the base of an oscillating fan, so that it pans back and forth. It doesn't take long until you dread having the thing sweep back, because you don't know what you'll see when it does.

Here’s a breakdown of the departments they came from:
My fiancee and I are Bayonne residents who travel into Jersey City every morning to drop her children off at school. Her son attends a Jersey City charter school on Cator Avenue. There is a police officer who's periodically directing traffic, but it is still an absolute nightmare to drop the kids off because their is no parking, so everyone normally just gets close to the school, double-parks and the kids get out of their respective cars and walk into the school. The officer normally allows it as long as it is done quickly. This morning I guess I wasn't quick enough because I did this and was pulled over and he wrote me a ticket for obstructing traffic.

Opera Mann is playing for his mom, who was in the audience Monday and has pancreatic cance. I really hate how they make a parent's ailment a selling point. I can't in good conscience vote for Mann singing "Bridge Over Troubled Water" like Luciano Pavarotti. I just don't see him getting a record contract, garnering any airplay or even hailing a cab successfully with his classically trained voice. Maybe he would've had a shot with me if he'd done something other than this heard-to-death selection and a noticeably truncated version at that. But complaining about it reminds me of the old joke that a restaurant is lousy because that the food is terrible and the portions are so small.

These are disparate personalities with individual gifts; each is damaged in some way. So it's no surprise, to paraphrase Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), that none of them play well with others.

And the state would spread out across its deserts and hillsides. Arizona would see the mighty Colorado River dammed, see tiny colleges grow into flourishing universities.

Cook wrapped his last tour a year ago. It was something, he says now, he needed for multiple reasons: For one, his fans pumped him up at a time when he was struggling emotionally.

Some years ago, there was a coup against the government of a Third World nation. The coup was led by a group of military officers. Midway through the coup, privates organized a coup against the officers. This group succeeded in taking control, but then discipline broke down. The troops began looting, which allowed the government to reassert itself. Both coups ultimately failed — the first because it lost its grassroots, the second for lack of focus.

The state first designated the strip of land on the west side of U.S. 101 a wayside in 1930, a time when the Highway Commission – charged then with promoting tourism and providing roads – was encouraging Oregonians to get out and explore the roadways. The wayside was little more than a parking strip, but by 1936, tourism had increased so much, the state added even more parking. That may have been the first cry for restroom relief. But the state wasn't interested.

We’ve heard it many times: Alex Smith has had a nice, breakout season after six underwhelming years, but he’s nothing more than a game manager; the 49ers rely on defense and special teams — not their quarterback — to win football games. The numbers prove it: Though he threw just five interceptions, he also has just 17 touchdown passes and was 20th in the NFL in pass attempts. But last week, Smith proved he may be more than that, orchestrating two long scoring drives down the stretch against the New Orleans Saints, including the game-winning touchdown pass with 9 seconds remaining. Today, the task will be more difficult, as he’ll face a relentless Giants pass rush and a back seven that has come together over the past month. On the other side, Eli Manning has been nearly flawless in the postseason, throwing for 607 yards and six touchdowns to just one interception through the two playoff games. While Smith has taken the step from bust to game manager, Manning has gone up the next rung, elevating to one of the league’s elite quarterbacks. Both teams will seek to establish a run game — the 49ers depend on it more than the Giants — but ultimately this game could be decided by which quarterback makes more big plays.

He also made a great defensive play in seventh to get Nick Markakis trying to score the tying run on a wild pitch.

Lipps fumbled the ball - that's the knock against him - and Johnny-on-the spot Tom Cousineau recovered on the Pittsburgh 47.

“L.A. Raw” also provides a different frame for the work of artists of color, although this effort turns out to be more problematic. It’s difficult to see the proud, beautiful portraits by artists Charles White and Judith Baca as “abject” in any way. Their intent, unlike many of their white contemporaries, was not to destroy or dissect the figure, but to find a way to represent those previously pushed to the edges of art history. Similarly, the work of John Outterbridge and Betye Saar, while it employs the patchwork aesthetic of assemblage, is much more about putting the pieces together than taking them apart.

The last time Obama commented publicly on a case of possible racial profiling was after Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested trying to force open the jammed door of his Cambridge home in 2009. After criticizing the arrest as "stupid," the president got an avalanche of criticism and wound up sitting down for a beer in the White House garden with Gates and the white cop who arrested him. That meeting sent the wrong message, implying that racial profiling is an individual problem rather than a systemic one.

There's nothing bigger than goaltending in the playoffs. You need saves and goaltending is the one position that can single-handedly carry you or push you out of the playoffs. You certainly need some luck. Most series are so tight one bounce here or there can often decide the outcome of a game.
