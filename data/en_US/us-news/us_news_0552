I don't read the Harry Potter books because of the "values" they espouse (friendship, courage, loyalty, and the like); I read them because they're exciting, fun, utterly absorbing entertainment. And because, as Harry matured and the books grew deeper, there was that something more as well--an emotional pull, a connection to the characters and the plotlines that is not unlike loyalty to a treasured friendship.

The two beasts, which were unveiled in 1907, have been whitewashed many times because of graffiti, but they actually say more about the origin of the Borglum style than the better-known works by Gutzon Borglum. They have no pedestals, sit on the grass like a contemporary installation and aren’t the product of measurements and anatomy studies, but of Solon Borglum’s eye for the animals and a sense of movement.

With so many ships and so much variety out there, it takes some research to find the right cruise. It's very easy to make a bad decision -- a cheap price tag can indicate a ship that's overdue for renovation; sailing with passengers in the same general age group could leave you surrounded by party animals when you prefer a quiet deck chair. Sometimes it's also hard to choose an itinerary when again, the variety is endless.

The house, completed just after World War I, fell into ruin after Shadid's great-grandmother's death in 1975, and was struck more recently by an Israeli rocket. Shadid, as battered by war as the crumbling structure, takes a leave of absence from reporting for one year, but instead of returning to his home in Maryland uses his sabbatical to restore, bit by bit, piece by piece, the house to its earlier grandeur. In the process, he edges toward peace within himself.

Teachers affirm that Clark is putting the apple on the right desk. Many teachers, including some of Oregon's who have self-outed in past Oregonian blogs or articles, say they are in a profession where they are having to watch their backs because parents can be scary.

Given his reaction, I suspected he was tired of St. Louisans asking him about Drewes, like a Minolta copier salesman telling people to stop using "Xerox" as a verb. But how many St. Louis tourists would it take - minus those who didn't make the McCluer connection - to get under his skin that way? Or maybe he simply loved Turner's and the question had somehow struck a nerve.

It's a good fit. Because the Bebenroths' catering business is flourishing ("frankly, we're 90 percent booked for 2012," Ben says), they set their sights on a casual motif and an extremely compact seasonal menu. It consists of just five "snacks" (such as mushroom beignets with goat cheese creme fraiche and polenta chickpea fries); two salads; a soup du jour; and a half-dozen "substantials." The last include buckwheat noodles in a shiitake and mushroom broth with winter greens; an andouille burger with house-smoked cheddar and coriander chips; and seared chicken breast with spaetzle, bacon, root vegetables and hickory sherry pan sauce. A steak, a grilled pork loin and a risotto featuring preserved squash round out the mains.

In movie posters, of course, he was identified as The Singing Cowboy. This special exhibition was tied in with what would have been his 100th birthday in September. Running daily for six months, it is titled rather grandly "Gene Autry and the Twentieth Century West - The Centennial Exhibition 1907-2007. I prefer to refer to simply as "The Cowboy's One-And-Only Spectacular and Sensational Wild West Show." In addition to all the other year-round Western exhibits and classic memorabilia featured at the museum, the collection of Autry's personal treasures is truly special.
I have a tendency to get a little earnest. Every story has to have a lesson; every activity has to be for a good reason. Sometimes I need reminders to do stuff just for kicks. And it's not only since I've become a priest. I remember being in grade school and thinking how wonderful it would to get older and not have people pressuring me to "have fun" all the time. One of my favorite teachers said to me once, "You were born thirty years old. At least."
Baker is perplexed that most of his hitters, except for Cozart (.341) and Joey Votto (.289), aren't hitting. "It's sort of disheartening, especially when you know your team can hit," said Baker.

I'm listening to what they're telling me and I'm not jumping too far ahead with my own conclusions."

GM said in the document that the company judged dealerships based on their sales, customer service index, capitalization and profitability. Sales accounted for 50 percent of the score and customer service was worth 30 percent. Dealers scoring less than 70 received a wind-down agreement.
Do not mistake that for snark. If fashion is art, then cosplay — which is how costumers refer to the act of dressing as a favorite sci-fi, fantasy or comic book character, showing off their handiwork, striking a pose for onlookers and simply being alongside other costumers — is unquestionably art, a kind of subgenre of fashion, one in which the goal is pure admiration and rarely financial. Indeed, if you consider that thousands among an estimated 40,000 attendees at McCormick over the weekend arrived in costumes, and that many of them changed outfits as frequently as models, C2E2 might now be Chicago's largest and most artful fashion show.
"I'm starting to feel secure that this not a flash in the pan," he said, but that the new business model will work.
Mike Miller, Heat. Miami wants to keep Miller, because the team feels it can get more out of him if he is healthy. The quirks of the new CBA, though, could force the Heat to let him go. The Heat will be over the cap even if they cut Miller, but keeping him puts the Heat too close to the luxury-tax threshold to address the team’s biggest need—a defensive-minded center—while still being able to fill out the rest of the roster.

Then there was the no-nonsense Sparacino. NFL owners have a long history of snookering cities and counties into bankrolling stadiums with public money at little risk to the teams -- but that wasn't going to happen with Sparacino. Retiring this spring, she knew this would be a big part of her legacy after 25 years with the city, and she drove her usual hard bargain despite the degree to which political leaders really, really wanted the deal to happen.
Yeah, they are big games and fantastic games to play in, I coached (in Seattle) in a playoff game with the Dynamo and Seattle. It was a great atmosphere and we need to create that atmosphere and that environment here in Portland.”

Republican Gov. John Love, who served from 1963-73, held a public meeting on growth early in his term, expecting a couple dozen participants. More than 200 came. And Democratic Gov. Dick Lamm (1974-86) started the Front Range Project in 1978, a monthly meeting of 200 citizens to identify the most important challenges. Open space was tops on the list. Douglas County refused to sign off on that, so something else was named, but in 1994, Dougco enacted its own excellent open space program, following Jefferson and other counties. And Democratic Gov. Roy Romer (1986-98) had a smart-growth program to determine where growth was most desirable.

Ninety percent of those who die of malaria live in sub-Saharan Africa, and most are children under 5. Their parents make on average less than $1 a day.

Again, the economy's swan dive proved to be downtown's gain. On the north end of the Strip, when the planned Fontainebleau Las Vegas resort ran out of financing, corporate raider Carl Icahn swooped in and bought the distressed property.

Tiger Woods had nowhere near as good a day. Struggling with his swing for the second straight round, he opened with two birdies on the first three holes, but gave that all back and more. He shot 3-over 75 and was at 3 over for the tournament, closer to the cut line of 5 over than the lead.
In his letter to Gibbons, Slusser noted that it was traditional that any board member can attend a closed committee session whether or not they are a member of that committee.

The West Virginia-rooted progressive rock act had been on a fruitless tour, supporting a pretty great debut LP that was receiving some of its most concentrated radio play in, of all places, Baltimore. Word spread and, as Witkowski explains, "The next time we came to town, it was bigger and bigger venues. It was like it was supposed to happen nationwide when bands break. It happened in Baltimore that way, it just didn't happen everywhere." Well, why not?

Express Scripts stock closed Thursday at $53.03 a share.
The 1997 Miami-New York playoff series was filled with angst, which all boiled over in Game 5 after Brown and Ward were jostling for rebounding position during a Heat free throw attempt. Brown flipped the Knicks guard over into a row of courtside photographers, sparking a melee that led to the suspensions of four New York players  Allan Houston, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and John Starks  for leaving their bench to join the fight. Those suspensions were ultimately upheld by a U.S. District Court judge.

I found both sandwiches to be good if largely indistinguishable, but neither lived up to the iconic status that decades of hype have bestowed upon the dueling restaurants. That's the problem with elevated expectations: They're nearly always impossible to live up to.

Austerity is out, growth is in. That's the general but uncertain message of two critical elections featuring one of Europe's biggest and one of its smallest economies. The shift could even play out in the U.S. presidential race, where the same fiscal choices are on display.
Nearly 200 people complained to the FTC that their credit reports listed them as dead, preventing them from accessing credit.

Car loans that had been paid off were reported as repossessions, and credit cards that had been paid off showed up as delinquent.
The movie business is predicated on predictability. Studios churn out sequels and remakes, directors rarely stray from their preferred genres and actors gravitate to the same sorts of roles. It's a pattern most everyone in Hollywood understands and accepts — but apparently not George Clooney, who's wrapping up a career year. And precisely when he couldn't be more admired as an actor, Clooney says he is pulling back from the very job that brought him renown.
I'll write more about Burnett if readers want me to, but let me focus for now on the larger problem with her -- and the trip to Occupy Wall Street is only a symptom of it. At a time when many people come to cable news looking for someone they can trust to help lead them out of the economic nightmare this country has plunged them into, she comes across as self-satisfied, smug, privileged and feeling not one whit of their pain. In fact, she's there to mock them and sarcastically say, "seriously!?" -- as she did of the protesters.
The game turned in the third in an ugly performance by Jimenez and his defense.

We are talking "Cinderella," Ben Stevenson's first full-length ballet and the first one he created in this country after having moved here from his native England. In its Ballet San Jose company premiere, this full-evening production -- on loan from American Ballet Theatre -- will wave its crooked magic wand at the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts through Sunday. And, even with all its faults, may it return soon.
Strengths Johnson is thick, and it shows when he tackles. He is a form tackler and sure to bring runners down. He is strong and can shed blocks with ease, and he filled the gap quickly in Nevada's defense. He is instinctive and highly active on the field, and is smooth in his pass set. He reacts well to both run and pass and should develop into a starter.
Apart from the books, the best place to get to know the writer is at the Colette Museum in a 17th century château on the hill above town. Its thoughtfully designed galleries contain art, photos and memorabilia that any Colette fan would consider treasures: the Palais-Royal bedroom suite where the invalid writer spent her last years; posters from her music hall career; pictures of her pets; and a room dedicated to her daughter, also Colette, with journalist-statesman Henry de Jouvenel. Her daughter, nicknamed "Bel Gazou," donated much of the material in the museum.

He had worked to the fringes of the tennis radar when his opening-round match at Wimbledon in 2010 against French qualifier Nicholas Mahut made the 6-foot-9 Isner a sensation.

So being forgotten is part of their charm. Newark and its suburbs, for example, swarm with statues of Abraham Lincoln, such as the particularly fine one by Frank Edwin Elwell in front of East Orange City Hall, a useful contrast with the railsplitter’s image in such contemporary products as the soon-to-be-released movie “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Killer.” Kids have been photographed sitting next to Lincoln on his bench in front of the Essex County Courthouse in downtown Newark for generations, but how many know that statue was cast by Gutzon Borglum, the same man who carved Mount Rushmore?

Anyhow...the 2 deep did not surprise me one bit. I really feel that the players on the 2 deep deserved to be there with their hard work. They put in the work to get where they are and, while I'm sure there will be on-going competition, it looks like they are going to be the guys we look to this season. Luckily, unlike past RU team, a lot of the positions of interest have experienced players involved in competition at the positions so I feel there's less a concern as past years where there was less. Then again...I'm just an observer and not an expert.

It is that way in Thursday's long-delayed, oft-evaded and much-anticipated postseason meeting of the two teams in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. Although Ohio State has been to three Final Fours since its three straight in early 1960s -- with the 1999 appearance vacated for rules violations -- and Cincinnati has been to one Final Four since its spree of five straight from 1959-63, neither has been the way they were.

A spa and fitness center are to open in the spring, and they may add to the overall sense of value. If the hotel can find its footing -- and a real bellman and valet -- it has a shot at snaring and keeping big-spending guests who want a smaller hotel with big ambitions.
Sure, he was skilled in the way he handled the dough and carefully positioned the pizza next to the fire, but it was his hair that was riveting. If someone were to do a prehistoric version of "Cats" and call it "Dinosaurs," he would be a shoo-in for the lead. The six orange spikes, dyed yellow at the roots, advanced down the center of his head, starting at the hairline and ending at the nape of the neck. With the styling product applied to maintain its shape, I worried that if he leaned too close to the oven, his hair could be like a candle touching a flame.

WASHINGTON -- In the summer of 1787, just 94 years after the Salem witch trials, as paragons of the Enlightenment such as James Madison, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin deliberated at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, a mob pelted and otherwise tormented to death a woman accused of being a witch. Prosecution of alleged witches, writes historian Edmund Morgan, had ceased in the colonies long before the English statute criminalizing witchcraft was repealed in 1736. Some popular sentiment, however, lagged.

The show tapes at Sunset-Bronson Studios every other week, disposing of 10 cases a day in front of a live audience. Financial judgments are paid by the production. Sheindlin often chastises litigants who can't convincingly back up their claims.

What's the deal: It would be easy to focus just on the 300 riveting photos of reef denizens taken by "Snorkel Bob," a.k.a. Robert Wintner, the founder of Hawai'i's ubiquitous Snorkel Bob's dive shop chain, but the subtitle suggests an underlying purpose for this underwater journey. The Maui-based entrepreneur is also a passionate advocate against the destruction of Hawaiian reef life by aquarium collectors, who can disrupt the ecoystem's delicate balance by wide-scale removal of desirable species. "There is no limit on the catch, there is no limit on the number of catchers....entire reefs have been emptied of yellow tangs, which exposes the reef to algae overgrowth," Wintner said in a recent phone interview, with alarming anecdotes of other vanished reef residents.

For an art exhibition, designers affiliated with the University of Toronto's architecture school arrayed 104 sensors in floral patterns on a green taffeta blanket, linking them with soft conductive material. The sensors relay moment-by-moment data about their orientation; the information goes to a processor and then wirelessly to a computer, which creates a 3-D rendering of the fabric's surface. One potential application is monitoring fitful sleepers, and the designers are brainstorming with medical engineers about ways to deploy "the blanket with an I.P. address" in hospitals.

Much of the commentary today on the agreement focuses on whether President Obama caved in to the Republicans and abandoned his party's principles. Some argue that he should have been just as recalcitrant as the tea party Republicans in hopes of repeating President Clinton's political success in staring down then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich during the government shutdown of 2005. But the stakes this time were a bit higher than closing the national parks for a few days. Mr. Obama was faced with the prospect of real economic chaos, a blow to national prosperity that might well have been worse and longer lasting than the financial crisis of 2007-2008. He did what he had to do. That is neither to his credit nor discredit. It is simply part of the job.

I applaud your editorial regarding the debt limit deal ("We Need An Election," Aug. 2). The recent debt ceiling compromise was no victory for the American public.

* Muhammad Ali is the most famous athlete in the history of the world. He's also suffering greatly from the ravages of Parkinson's disease. Was it really necessary for the Marlins to roll Ali out there as part of the pregame festivities? Look, I understand that there is a connection. Early in his career, Ali trained at Miami's famed 5th Street Gym. Ali first won the heavyweight championship, upsetting Sonny Liston, in a title bout at the Miami Convention Center. But I don't know what Ali has to do with major-league baseball. It was uncomfortable to watch. And with Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria riding alongside Ali, squeezing the former champ ... it reeked of exploitation. Perhaps I'm wrong about this. If Ali wanted to do it, and it made him happy to hear the cheers again, then why object? I know, I know. But seeing it live ... it just didn't seem right. I'm just being honest in sharing what I felt at that moment.
As I was thinking about this topic, it made me wonder if my own recollections and perceptions accurately represented the popular culture of the day.

Siegel, who has run the Dodgers' ticket department for 16 years — and four owners — said the fan reaction Wednesday was similar to what the team experienced when it acquired Manny Ramirez in 2008.

We took a quick drive in the T/X Baja at last year's Texas Auto Writers Association event where Toyota brought out the Baja Series and let us get behind the wheel. The short off-road course was not nearly fast and challenging enough to let the Baja spread its wings, so we made a point of complaining to Toyota often enough that the automaker finally threw us the keys to shut us up.

Back where there's a Washington that connects to Oregon, the expectation of large piles of federal money to pay for a new Columbia River Crossing is something that local officials think they can take to the bank. Murray is in a powerful transportation position in the Senate, Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio is chairman of the House surface transportation subcommittee, there's a new five-year national transportation reauthorization due -- and the Columbia is, after all, a crunching bottleneck on a major national trucking route.
Austerity has been the main prescription across Europe for dealing with the continent's nearly 3-year-old debt crisis, brought on by too much government spending. But what does it mean for the average European? Imagine paying sales tax of 23 percent or more. Or having your wages cut by 15 percent. Or, if you're in Ireland, both. Austerity comes in many forms: higher taxes, fewer state benefits, more job cuts, working longer until retirement, you name it.

The president could help sort out this confusion with some straightforward answers that define objectives in Libya and offer a realistic timetable to achieve them. Obama also needs to explain why Libya is worthy of intervention but not, say, Syria or Sudan, and why NATO's apparent goal of killing Moammar Gadhafi does not run afoul of U.S. and international law. Finally, he needs to lay out the end game in what increasingly resembles a civil war.
The report also called for sweeping changes and updates in the state’s gaming regulations, mirroring them more closely on Nevada. Rules and laws need to be updated and eased based on changes in technology since the casino rules in New Jersey were first drafted a generation ago — before the explosion of computers and prior to the gaming industry being taken over by multi-national conglomerates based in far-flung locales.

In early December, the dollar scraped a 20-month low against the euro and 14-year low against the pound. Though the dollar has strengthened slightly since then, questions about the currency remain a focus for economic policy makers. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke traveled to Beijing for meetings last week and afterward top U.S. and Chinese officials said they agree that increased currency flexibility in China will be a key to reducing global trade imbalances. China's alleged practice of keeping the yuan artificially weak against the dollar is often cited as an important issue for U.S. trade. But the value of the venerable greenback has other important implications as well.

“No child left behind” is a catchy slogan, but it doesn’t describe the likely outcome of current U.S. education policy.

Executive compensation is continuing to climb. That is because companies benchmark their compensation against similar companies, according to Temple University accounting professor Steven Balsam, author of Executive Compensation: An Introduction to Theory and Practice.

At the heart of these three efforts is a sense of family; or better yet, a sense of place. In "Where I Was From," that place is physical, whereas in the later books it becomes psychological; still, for all intents and purposes, the perspective is the same. "The books are similar in that they ask more questions than they answer," Didion says.

What is Cask Ale? “Cask ale is often called ‘real ale’ in the UK” said Brian. “It is beer that has been fermented fully, aged, and then primed with either raw wort (unfermented beer) or sugar, and allowed to referment in the cask from which it will be served.” Cask Ale is generally harder to find at local bars here in the United States and is more common in Europe.

Apes have long held a fascination for humans because of their very humanness — the expressive eyes, those opposable thumbs, the playful personalities, their innate curiosity, the easy affection — and the chimps are natural hams. The filmmakers lean heavily on that appeal, letting the camera linger as young chimps tumble in play, swing through trees and shriek with delight while their elders look on in amusement. The close-ups are remarkable for the emotions captured, never more so than when Isha feeds, grooms and cuddles her little one.
"The only way we can keep Dellwood's police department now is if a miracle happens," he said. "We don't want to keep hanging out and letting our city go down. If (Johnson) doesn't listen to the residents now, they know what to do when she's up for re-election."
