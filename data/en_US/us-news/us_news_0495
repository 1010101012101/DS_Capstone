The game was close for a few minutes, with SLU leading 8-6 with 12:37 to go in the first half, but that was pretty much the last anyone saw of the Salukis, who were using eight players who weren't on the team last year. A three-point play by Ellis got things started. A 3-point basket by Cassity followed and after SIUC scored to make it 14-8, SLU went on a 17-1 run, and some of the baskets were pretty easy. SLU led by 22 at the half, by 27 early in the second half, and then it was a matter of just avoiding complacency, which it didn't always do. But in this case, it didn't matter.

The menu, which lists over 100 items, is confusingly organized and hard to read. There are, eye-crossingly, a section for entrees and others for seafood, curry dishes, and noodles and rice.

Directly across the street from the Château de Savigny, now an airplane and motorcycle museum, is the winery of Domaine Simon Bize, housed in a sprawling shed, presided over by Patrick Bize, the diminutive, laconic fourth-generation proprietor. His great-grandfather, one of three consecutive Simon Bizes, founded the domain in 1880, and Patrick inherited it, somewhat reluctantly, in 1972. "I didn't even like wine," he told me, "and I didn't want to work in the vineyards or the cellar." Fortunately, he grew to love his birthright, especially the vineyard work. He seems to know every vine on his patchwork, nearly 50-acre domain.

In a culture where owning outdated things isn’t acceptably cool, the larger portion of consumers will ultimately latch on to the newer product, even if its substance is inferior. Sure, some may gripe about the dropoff in quality, but of course, there’s always next year.

A 2010 city of Portland memo identified Adams' 2007 proposal for fixing the westside streets as "the best solution for addressing the complex mix of problems" on the two roads.

Democracy was only re-established in 1990 in Chile after General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte's dictatorship (1973-90) was voted out. Pinochet had established Chile as one of the most open economic systems in the developing world although leftists criticize economic inequality.

Then, in response to the smile of God, in one majestic finale, the individual shades of color blend into one perfect light as the full-orbed sun bursts into view. A new day is born at the hand of God, who specializes in new beginnings.

But Ms. Newhouse has learned that ideal acoustics are not even necessary for a hall to succeed. The essential factor is ambience—the sum total of how a place looks, feels and sounds, an intangible combination that satisfies the senses and fills an important but unexpressed social need that extends from the audience's shared experience to its communication with the performing artists.

It's becoming apparent that what Councilmember Vreeland has in common with Punxsutawney Phil is that both are in hibernation. Last week's council meeting was unable to conduct any business due to the fact that they lacked a quorum.

He chafed at any comparison between Massachusetts and Texas.
As you can imagine, the choice of a glove is as different as the player choosing them. The webbing, the fit, the length, the color (red!), and so on are all reflective of the individual's tastes and position. Most players will have a gamer on hand -- self-explanatory -- and a future gamer they are working into shape. Matt Carpenter has had to get comfortable with a new first baseman's glove this season. Rick Ankiel, on the day he retired as a pitcher, grabbed a glove from Jim Edmonds, because he didn't own an outfielder's glove.

Chef Peter Merriman is considered one of the founders of Hawai'i Regional Cuisine, in its own way a forerunner of today's "locavore" trend. When you live in one of the most isolated island chains in the world, it makes sense to eat what's at hand, and what has been hand-crafted.

"It was absolutely marvelous," he said of his salad days in Hollywood. "You got paid 40 weeks a year. You had three months when you were not working and you were very well looked after being part of the MGM machine. I loved it. But unfortunately, it was toward the end of the studio system and television was starting to bite. In fact, we weren't allowed to appear in anything on TV when I was under contract to MGM, which rather annoyed me. They stopped me from doing some very good plays on TV."

It would limit the city's options for public gathering space. That was a top priority of the citizen-led iMesa initiative.

Action cannot wait until the start of the 2012 General Assembly session in three months. We need a fix-it special session, with big-picture solutions that will not just get Maryland moving now but strengthen our state for the future. Fixing our tax structure for businesses (not increasing gas taxes, as Mr. O'Malley proposed Monday) to spur economic investment and create new jobs might be a start. We need leadership and courage in Annapolis, to overcome the challenges of this moment. Given the national and global trends and the state of politics, we simply cannot continue to put off solutions to study what we know can work, such as regulatory reform — as the governor seems to be doing. After all, his eventual choice for president once told us, "Yes we can."
"There's a couple things you wish with him," Kiper said. "You wish he was 6-2, not 6 feet even. You can put weight on, but you just wish he was 2 inches taller. You wish his arm strength, which has gotten better, was just a little better than it is. You wish he was a little bit better athlete than he is, and you wish he was a little bit quicker than he is.

Gilbert and pro partner Maks Chmerkovskiy (in a pink open shirt showing off his buff, spray-tanned torso) took the floor for a salsa dance. "We intend to stay as long as possible," said Melissa in her rehearsal segment, even though she wore a neck brace and hard hat. On the floor, Maks did most of the fancy steps while she tried to keep up, even as he dragged her around in a twirl that couldn't have felt good on her neck, and ended with her spinning on the floor. The audience loved it, applauding her effort. Bruno said she lacked "control." Carrie Ann said it was "beautiful" to see how much "confidence" she has gained, but said Bruno was right - she lacked an element of control. Said Len, "I saw excellent parts and parts that weren't so good." Scores: 7, 7, 7 = 21

Dishes I don't remember from before seemed confused.

A decade ago, I would have made a sharp distinction between discrimination and prejudice. I understood and agreed that while the law could prohibit discrimination -- that is, the denial of opportunity based on race, ethnicity, religion, etc. -- it couldn't do much to keep people from feeling and expressing prejudice toward others. But nowadays, with racist rhetoric rising, I've decided we aren't taking the social effects of this type of vandalism seriously enough.

The whole time in Mendocino, the residents of this bohemian town told us how unusual the warm, sunny weather was for February. We stayed at the most luxurious bed-and-breakfast, the Brewery Gulch Inn, falling asleep to the sound of frogs in the woods. We walked along the rocky Pacific coast and watched an amazing sunset. We dined on the freshest mussels and mushrooms and drank fabulous wines from the Mendocino region. We even went whale watching and were one of only two couples on the boat. The captain said there were more whales to be seen that day than any other day in the last year.

"Often the don't-kill-the-messenger-rule isn't observed because there's so much anger and bitterness in divorce relationships," Ross says. "The parent explodes, and the child thinks, 'I shouldn't have said anything,' and they internalize it as their parents' being angry with them."

Do we really need a beauty queen to tell us how to solve our local school curriculum controversies? Maybe so, but only if she's actually thought it through and can articulate her argument.

Hey, Bill: I don't disagree with the great running back lineage you cite. However, the Browns' dynasty was established by a passing attack led by Otto Graham that was ahead of its time and took its opponents by storm for about a decade. Do the names Dante Lavelli, Mac Speedie and Ray Renfro ring a bell? They were awesome receivers during the Browns' dynastic years. So, no, I would not agree with your premise, especially in this era of the NFL.

In the case of 'The Hunger Games,' I want to see how Jennifer Lawrence tops her stellar performance in 'Winter's Bone.' Because she's in 'The Hunger Games,' I read all three books and can't wait to see the movie. But whether it's the subject or the star, I'll only be interested in the sequels if I care about the characters in the original."

Your grandmother is coming to New York for her annual visit. You want to take her to a nice, safe Broadway show, and the two of you saw "Anything Goes" last year. What to do? Simple: Head for "Nice Work If You Can Get It," a jukebox musical in which Kathleen Marshall endeavors to make lightning strike twice, this time with songs by George and Ira Gershwin instead of Cole Porter. While it's not nearly as good as its predecessor, it's also not entirely bad. The songs are classic, the dances are dynamite, and everybody loves Kelli O'Hara. So what if the book is relentlessly unamusing and the acting rigidly derivative? You can't win 'em all, right?

Fickell doesn't react well to praise. Thinks it breeds complacency. Probably thinks a happy warrior is a guy who hasn't looked at the scoreboard in a while. The anger from being snubbed and the need to disprove doubters are more Fickell's meat and potatoes.

The G25x's gas savings aren't as great as you might expect. The automatic-equipped G37 gets an EPA-estimated 19/27 mpg city/highway, while the G25, which is offered only with an automatic transmission, is rated 20/29 mpg.

The difference for the all-wheel-drive models is similarly minimal: The G37x is rated 18/25 mpg and the G25x is 19/27 mpg.
Scheurich redesigned the space, moved the sink under the window for a view, took out the upper cabinets and replaced them with stand-alone cabinets that have the look of built-in hutches. Lower rustic alder cabinets complete the storage. Silestone counters in creams and browns tie together the colors.
The remap created opportunities for newcomers in the city and added new terrain for those already serving at the Capitol. That's led to some contentious campaigns in Chicago, where Democrats are so dominant that winning Tuesday's primary election is tantamount to winning a spot in Springfield. And the intensity is magnified because this primary may be the last, best shot a new or insurgent candidate has to win a legislative seat until the next new district maps are crafted a decade from now.

Like Alma's narration, for the most part Jacobsen's filmmaking style is deadpan, all the better to see the inherent humor of Alma's situation. To suggest the texture of Alma's fantasies, however, Jacobsen opts for high-key lighting. To give exposition of activities where Alma herself is not present, Jacobsen uses black-and-white stills to create a documentary feel.
"We're trying to get him to keep his hands more in the middle of his body as opposed to taking them behind him," Jones said. "He's gotten into a little bit of a habit of carrying them behind his body too far. That affects his lead arm getting on the target and staying there long enough."

Maggiano's makes no bones about being an Italian restaurant. The minute the revolving door stops, you're greeted with recordings of legendary crooners such as Dean Martin and Perry Como. There's even a large portrait of "Ol' Blue Eyes" hanging over the reservation desk. The martini menu is fairly typical, except for the Red Delicious Apple ($10). What makes this different from an Apple Martini? It's made with Crown Royal whiskey, not vodka. Although it should be consumed slowly, the sour apple pucker and the cranberry juice gives it a crisp, clean taste. -- Greg Burnett
"The next day -- Good Friday -- was the hardest for me," said Laura Fouts, who worked a decade for Joe's, quitting just before her son was born in 1984. "At that point, it became real that it was going to be no more."
If Carmona/Heredia does manage to re-enter the country, MLB is expected to suspend him. I think whatever the penalty, it's going to sting. This is MLB's chance to make an example of a fairly high-profile player and I think it will take full advantage to send the message you're seeking.

We left the final decision up to Kevin. There were 3 final schools and all were choices we were comfortable with. The major factor for Kevin was a comfort level with the coaches but even more so, the players. The players at the other schools were just different in so many ways. Even simple things like clothes and what music they listened to. For us as parents. It was having him close to home. Rutgers being a very good school and the coaches. Made you feel like your son was going to be in a very good situation.

The 2100, aimed at students in kindergarten through eighth grade, has a 10-inch (25-centimeter) screen and a keyboard that's a little bigger than regular netbooks. It can be configured with a touch screen, which Dell says is useful for kids' small hands, and an anti-microbial keyboard, because those hands are often grubby. A Web camera add-on is also available. It can run basic versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows XP and Vista operating systems and the Ubuntu version of Linux.

Second, restore our planning function. The city involved thousands of citizens in preparing its new General Plan, a comprehensive document adopted in 2008 and largely ignored by the current administration. We need to update neighborhood plans and zoning laws to make them consistent with the General Plan. And we need to continue to plan. The San Diego Foundation's Show Your Love, San Diego initiative, envisioning a sustainable and enhanced quality of life for our region, demonstrated the value in thinking about what our future can become.

In the 1990s, Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton worked with the Congress to do just that, and they helped to move the country from deficit to surplus by the end of the decade. Only a similar willingness to make hard choices will lead the country out of the current crisis. Let's leave the Constitution alone. It didn't create the debt problem, and it won't solve it for us.

And Jernigan's $3.5 million was more than the top administrators of the famed Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Health System made … combined.

It would be reassuring to know that the person heading the draft, and orchestrating the potential trades that could arise, is the same person who will be charting the course for the coming years.

Q: Hey, Tony: The officiating crews have been more dominant than anybody's offense or defense and they're not getting more TV time just because teams are working the kinks out. I understand their positioning has changed this year, enabling one of the officials to see and be able to call more penalties. That combined with mandatory reviews on touchdowns and additional flags flying on petty or bad calls may lead to household-name officials dragging games out to 31/2 hours or more. Bad calls not subject to review like the calls on D'Qwell Jackson and Brian Robiskie will continue to aggravate the fans while the penalty against Andy Reid for requesting a review on a play that is now automatically going to be reviewed (figure that one out) was simply bizarre. -- Jan Bilson, Bradenton, Fla.

Hey, Doug: The 49ers have been collecting quality players on defense for years. I am surprised that new coach Jim Harbaugh has quarterback Alex Smith playing at a level he has never approached before. Also, Frank Gore is a premier running back.

Q I too have seen something similar and stepped up to confront a driver's behavior. I was just parking in a grocery store lot when there was a car parked opposite me. A woman had gotten out and then yelled at her son who sat behind her in the car. Then she hit him several times on the legs. I honked and yelled out of the window something like "hey, that isn't right" and "I'll report this."

The day after the day after, I walked as if in a trance to the Javits Center to volunteer. Part of a long line of New Yorkers there for the same reason, I asked if I could do anything, lug water bottles to delivery trucks for first responders - anything. Nothing was needed. Walking back home, there was never a time I didn't choke up when passing a deli or diner with a sign reading "Free food for all cops and firefighters."

The artist, who attended Westfield High School, lived in no fewer than five homes in Westfield. The house at 522 Elm St. contains six bedrooms, 2½ baths, hardwood floors, a wood-burning fireplace, formal dining room, eat-in kitchen, powder room, front porch and rear deck. About the most sinister items in the basement are a can of Kilz sealer/primer and a rusty band saw. The upstairs floors do creak, but that's about it. Nightmare on Elm Street? Home on the Deranged? Not quite.
Your family may be the stay-at-home-on-the-holidays type. If that's the case, you might think breakfast in bed is just the thing to honor Mom on her day. But this year, why not ask her opinion? It's entirely possible that the female parental unit in your house would prefer dinner on the deck over breakfast in bed. Even if she has to fix some of that dinner herself.

Fitting, as Shannon was the best thing about a disappointing movie. If you're a betting person, you might lay odds down on Shannon getting another nomination for his role in "Take Shelter," which opens Friday.

One thing about Major League Baseball scheduling secret season openers in Japan: My Twitter timeline the middle of the night is all yours.
You may not have the means to be as generous as your aunt, but that's not the point. Let's assume, again, your sister is just as worthy of these gifts. Every time your aunt and uncle deny her something they've given you, they're casting a passive "nay" vote against her. Yet every "yea" vote your sister gets from others diminishes the power of these negative votes. When your parents spoke up on her behalf, for example, that was a "yea" vote. Enough "yea" votes reduce your aunt and uncle to an eye-roll in your sister's life.
Cost probably was another factor for the powertrain carry-over. Without a heavy price tag for research and development on a new engine and transmission to pass to consumers, Honda can throw more content into the CR-V and increase the base price only $400.
Writing in the American Prospect magazine, Jason Furman – senior economics adviser to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004 and now one of the two or three most influential economists working in the Obama White House – described Wal-Mart as a "progressive success story." Furman noted that every single independent study showed Wal-Mart's goods were much less expensive than rival retail firms and that its Supercenter stores offering groceries saved families an average of 20 percent on their food budgets. Given that food eats up so much of low-income families' disposable income, Furman noted these savings were enormously beneficial to the less affluent.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take up a similar authorization resolution next week, sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass. and John McCain, R-Ariz.
On his best day, Porcello's sinker is so good that he doesn't need to worry about the how or the why. He is just lucky to be the who. But Porcello is a thoughtful sort -- when he arrived in the big leagues at 20, his teammates marveled at his maturity -- and that's not always good.
I don’t know if his stats on Boston’s Charlestown neighborhood are true — it’s been pretty yuppified over the past decade, and, no matter what “The Departed” says, the Irish mob seems to be in decline. But it’s certainly alive and unwell in “The Town.”
"Governor-elect Kasich is disappointed that the White House is not giving Ohio the flexibility he has asked for to use the money for infrastructure needs like freight rail that can spur commerce and economic growth," his spokesman, Rob Nichols, said.

Johnson had to grow long ago. His father, former ASU player Joey Johnson, told his mother, Michelle, that she needed to take their third-grade boy to play at the south Phoenix Salvation Army if Nick was not going to live with him in California. He wanted Nick to be hardened by older "street ball" kids who would not be easily overwhelmed by his athleticism.

"(Chris) Volstad ended up getting the guy over after messing the bunts up. All you can do is work on it. Sometimes it's different for people when they get in the games. You can do all you want on 50-mph (batting-practice pitches), but you have to get your nose in there to be a good bunter."

Just three hours north of Baltimore in Sullivan County, Pa. is a quiet community called Eagles Mere — also known as The Town that Time Forgot. It has been a summer retreat over a hundred years and also has great hiking, fishing, kayaking and lovely forests.

The other place with a claim to predate Champagne sits along a remote 30-kilometer stretch of the Drome tributary of the Rhone river, between the northern and southern Rhone Valley.

Nowadays, grape must is chilled below freezing in steel tanks and fermented to about 3 percent alcohol, then bottled and allowed to continue fermentation. Unlike most sparkling wines, there's no added dosage at the end. The result, with about 7 percent alcohol, is like a refined sweet Moscato.

The pain was indescribable. The impact had broken his back and shattered vertebrae. And then he began, with the instinct for survival of any animal, to swim upward toward light and air. When he broke through the surface of the water he was stunned to be alive, and momentarily thought he was hallucinating. He tried to swim toward a bridge pylon, but his pain overwhelmed him and he began to sink beneath the water again, struggling against dying. He managed to bring his head above water when he felt something -- something alive, a creature -- brush his legs.

The scope of what Kasich wants -- on tax cuts, schooling, fracking and the environment, and pruning the bureaucracy -- recalls a slogan attributed to Chicago School architect Daniel Burnham, who designed the landmark Wyandotte Building, just around the corner from the Statehouse, and helped quarterback Cleveland's Group Plan: "Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood."
