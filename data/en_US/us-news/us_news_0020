A couple of my pets, like your dog, are in their senior years Kody, our Pomeranian, came to us when he was 7 weeks old. Technically, he was my oldest daughter's dog, and when she got married and moved away a few years ago, she took Kody with her. As it turned out, Kody was allergic to something in the new place, so he came back to me (and that is A-OK; he is a sweetheart, and I missed him).

In mid-March he found pollen levels that were as heavy as those normally seen in May or June.

That does not mean that they were in any way pedestrian. Langrée, working without scores, brought a spirit of youthful freshness and energy and led with an appealing clarity throughout.
Partly because generations of wine lovers were told that some vintages are better than others -- which is to say the growing season was better. Here in Oregon, just ask any grower or wine buff about the growing season difference between the 2007 (rainy during picking) and 2008 (cool spring but glorious fall) vintages. Does the difference reveal itself in the wines? It sure does.

There are other mythic themes in the paintings such as Narcissus, the beautiful youth who fell in love with his reflected image; Gala, portrayed as creator-destroyer or saint-seductress. I would have wished for more pointed explanations in the exhibition's wall labels. Often, those texts are distractions that inhibit our own discoveries about art but in this case, with the myriad ideas working through the paintings, specific references to mythological examples would have been helpful.

But sometimes there's no difference. Lake knows the odds, a 30 percent survival rate within five years, and knows that the new lesion on his liver could mean nothing serious or more chemotherapy or something worse. He goes back in for more tests this week. A new cancer sign or biohazard symbol tattoo on his wrist next year wouldn't be the worst that could happen. Lake says he doesn't walk around crying or stay up sweating at night. Instead, cancer has concentrated his energy toward what matters most.

One highly recommended adult vaccination protects against three serious bacterial diseases: tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Tetanus causes painful muscle spasms and stiffness; if head and neck muscles are affected, patients may be unable to open their mouths (a condition known as "lockjaw").

Pertussis (whooping cough) causes severe coughing fits and may lead to complications, including pneumonia.

There is no easy explanation for the toll. Over the last decade, though, the demands on Guard members have profoundly changed. Once a force typically called on only for occasional stints of disaster relief work, the Guard is now commonly summoned for long deployments to combat zones.

* When Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8, he installed a system that featured short shifts to avoid having players out on the ice too long, dragging and vulnerable. The fresher the legs the faster the tempo, and with Hitch as coach the Blues had more shifts per game than any NHL team. The same is true in the NHL postseason. The Blues have taken 1,898 shifts through four games, most among the 16 postseason teams. That's an average 474.5 shifts per game, the most by any of the 16 postseason teams. San Jose is averaging 435.8 shifts per game. On at least one occasion the Blues caught the Sharks in a long, tiring shift and it played a role in B.J. Crombeen's goal that gave the Blues a 1-0 lead in Game 4.

Charles Brown, North Carolina, CB: At 5-foot-9 and 210 pounds, Brown lacks the ideal size for a cornerback, but he possesses enough traits where scouts feel he has a good chance to catch on with an NFL team as a nickel back. Brown, who started 12 games for the Tarheels last season, is tough and competitive, loves to hit and support the run and has good ball skills, evidenced by his eight career interceptions. The Ravens are stocked with young cornerbacks, but Brown’s ability to return kickoffs and punts gives him an extra dimension.

Austin, of the Economic Policy Institute, offers a look at a topic many don't want to broach: racial discrimination in hiring.

The genre was popular long before she took a stab at it with "The Mysterious Affair at Styles" (which sat in the publisher's office for five years before it was accepted for a pittance and published in the early 1920s), but it was much more hidebound. Hercule Poirot entered loudly dismissing all the old familiar tropes, proudly declaring that it was not for him, this Holmesian propensity for scrambling around in the dirt collecting cigarette ash and bits of burnt letter; instead the work was done by the little gray cells. Tommy and Tuppence Beresford were the postwar adventurers, creating a whole new template for romance with their thrill-seeking banter, and the popularity of Miss Marple began the race for Most Unlikely Detective, in this case, a spinster of a certain age who used her hard-won understanding of human nature to solve crimes.

But it is inaccurate to frame this debate as simply another battle between those who care about the environment and those who want to exploit it. The environmentalists who tout wind energy and other relatively green sources of energy point out that we are producing and consuming energy in such a manner as to throw the globe's human and ecological future into doubt. Runte appears to believe that to acknowledge this amounts to giving "everything called 'renewable' ... a pass."

Supporters of Proposition 29 say that voters want to see a strong relationship between a special tax and how it's spent. Cigarettes cause cancer, heart disease and lung problems, so it makes sense to use the tax to find out more about those diseases. To paraphrase "Thre Mikado," whose "object all sublime" was to "let the punishment fit the crime," the idea is that the object must be to let the benefit fit the tax.
It worked, but sage advice couldn't stop Stenhouse's engine from blowing up on the last lap with Edwards on his rear fender. Stenhouse's No. 6 car spun and Edwards, blinded by the smoke, pushed it across the finish line first.

In 2009, the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority tightened its travel policy after Lindbergh Field officials were criticized for flying premium-class to various destinations.
Trout's blazing speed will make him an asset to fantasy teams. And as it's been said before, speed never goes into a slump. If manager Mike Scioscia gives him the green light, Trout could steal 30-40 bases. And while double-digit home runs are possible, don't expect Trout to show a whole lot of power this early in his career.
Still, he couldn’t predict miracles for the GOP in New Jersey, where registered Democrats have a massive registration advantage.
Priceline remains the best known opaque agency and its "name your price" bidding model is still unique, as far as I know. And a new online site, TheBiddingTraveler (www.thebiddingtraveler.com) has mounted a beta version of an automated system to help you bid. As with Priceline's own entry page, you list destination, date(s), and hotel rating; the site also asks you for a minimum-to-maximum bidding rate range. When you select a district within a big city, the site displays recent winning and losing bids at specific hotels within each range. The site responds with a "recommended lowball offer" and "recommended final offer" rates, based on recent experience. Then, you can either bid manually or the site will automatically bid for you. Other sites that provide information from other travelers about successful bids, unsuccessful bids, and hotel identities include Better Bidding (www.betterbidding.com) and BiddingForTravel (www.biddingfortravel.com). They're always worth a look before you enter an opaque bid or accept an opaque price.

Costumes by Paul Tazewell are first rate, especially Blanche's white, frilly gowns and frocks. He's cleverly made some great shirts for Stanley by riffing off the character's love of bowling. Many in the audience clearly wanted Underwood to wear as little as possible and he often obliges, but never exploitatively.

Four of the eight nonsteak entrees are fundamental Italian-American preparations - piccata, Marsala, Milanese and Parmigiana - offered in chicken or veal. We tried the veal piccata ($22.95), three fairly large, suitably thin scallops of veal in a butter sauce with tangible but not overbearing tartness from lemon and salty tanginess from capers.
A. Richard Lewis has this incredible ability to look like he’s just ... you know it’s an act that’s been honed. What you have to do in standup is create spontaneity, somehow, even though you’ve done this act a million times, you gotta look like you’re almost just thinking of it now, to make it entertainer. The great Bill Hicks has the best opening line in the history of an HBO special. For his one real hour-long HBO special, he walked out and said, “Guys, I know you’re all excited because this is a TV taping for HBO and everything, but if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna slap on a fake smile and try to barrel through this s--- one more time.”

Companies that can't recruit American-trained foreigners to work in the United States may opt to hire them at offshore locations. Or the United States may simply lose these U.S.-trained professionals to other countries. Either way, fewer jobs are created in the United States and America's competitiveness slips.

What do you get when you cross a tiki bar with an Irish pub? No idea. But I'm sure it looks like Stamper's "Paddy-o" -- a Polynesian stew loaded with pink flamingos, glowing fish heads, beach signs and thatched huts.

The Wings badly, badly want Helm back, because as Babcock puts it, that slots everybody else in the right position on the third and fourth lines. Babcock has taken issue of late with the third and fourth lines, saying they haven't brought enough energy and physicality, something that's going to be vital against the Predators.

Not even Tim Tebow can clean up Meyer's fraudulent image anymore.

John Davis, a former aide to John Edwards, testified about bungled efforts to keep the former presidential candidate's affair with videographer Rielle Hunter hidden from staff, including an awkward encounter when Hunter showed up at a hotel weeks after her work filming Edwards had ended. Hunter's contract with the campaign wasn't renewed at the end of 2006, Davis said. But in February 2007, he ran into her in an elevator at the candidate's Detroit hotel, and shortly afterward she told him she and Edwards were in love, Davis testified at Edwards' federal corruption trial.

In fact, Detroit documentaries have become such a prevalent phenomenon that the Changing Gears website ran a tongue-in-cheek guide to making one.

Hey, Jack: As of now, the Cavs stand to shed $31.5 million in payroll when O'Neal's and Ilgauskas' contracts expire next summer. However, the Cavs are way, way over the salary cap and deep into the luxury tax. So that doesn't mean they'll be $30 million under the cap. While they will potentially have some cap space, it's nothing close to what it would take to offer a maximum contract to a player like Bosh. Unless, of course, James signs elsewhere. It is because of this fact that there will be heavy consideration to make a trade before the deadline.

For two years, my family lived in the shadow of the city that is internationally known for being the birthplace of the original pizza -- Naples, Italy. While every city worldwide claims to have the "best" pizza, Napoli truly can boast this -- pizza margherita with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, on a thin, nearly burned crust. It's simple but delicious. In March 2006, my mother traveled from the States to Italy to visit us and our 51/2-year-old son, Joshua. My mother, Joshua and I enjoyed a wonderful day trip from the Navy base in Gricignano to the island of Procida, just off the famous Amalfi Coast. The culmination of our trip? Dinner at a family-run pizzeria, where all the participants were fortunate to be able to make their own pizza from scratch, observe it baking in the famous brick pizza oven and then ultimately indulge in devouring their pizza. This is among my favorite memories of Italy. -- Elizabeth Krempasky, Strongsville
A good shoe must be anchored by a sturdy, invisible shank, supported by a steely heel and coddled by a cushy footbed. There are myriad things that can go wrong. Most good heels use tempered steel in the shank—a piece of metal in the inner sole—and in the heel. A shoe should be very rigid so that the wearer can rest weight on her heel, without having to balance on the ball of her foot. But some shoe makers insert a weak metal shank or use cheaper materials such as plastic.

For several years, money has been the second goal as I walk — the first, of course, is exercise. You are right: Pennies rate No. 1, but nickels, dimes and quarters, even a dollar, show up once in a while. All the money I collect in one year goes to orphanages in Tijuana and Nicaragua.
No one doubts the honest passion of those who fear vaccines. And for some people, no amount of communication or dialogue or reasoning will stop them from worrying. But risk perception is ultimately subjective, a combination of the facts and how those facts feel, and sometimes our fears don't match the evidence. The dangers that sometimes arise because of the way we perceive risk must be managed, too. But we must act in the face of this threat to public health.

The Louisville Slugger is the "official bat of Major League Baseball," but competition has cut into its onetime near monopoly. Today 60 percent of major league players use the company's ash and maple bats. They keep all the specs on players' preferences (Example: Prince Fielder, first base, Milwaukee Brewers: Bat Model C271, ash, black finish, length, 33.5 inches; weight, 34 ounces). You can buy a model with your own name on it, just like the major leaguers. Only it's not – the finest grain is still set aside for the pros.
"What can I say about our next two presenters?" began Gervais, introducing two more actors. "The first is an actor, producer, writer and director whose movies have grossed over $3 and a half billion at the box office. He's won two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes for his powerful and varied performances, starring in such films as 'Philadelphia,' 'Forrest Gump,' 'Castaway,' 'Apollo 13' and 'Saving Private Ryan.' The other ... is Tim Allen."

The buyouts come as Rutgers is dealing with a budget crisis prompted by cuts in state funding. Last month, the university canceled raises and froze the salaries of all 13,000 employees on its New Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses. Rutgers’ unions, including the union representing professors, are mounting a legal challenge to lift the salary freeze.
Both narratives at work in Israel and Palestine trade in victimhood. Like it or not, divestment simply feeds the sense of victimhood on both sides. It vindicates the Palestinian sense of violation, and feeds the paranoia of the Israelis.

"We moved up one, but I think potentially we'll move up even higher. Because of the timing of the law and when it passed, we're in the very early stages of finding out about companies staying and expanding, and companies we might not have had a shot at before giving us a second look," he said.
The thing was, the guy, who served in the Marines and worked for years for the postal service, really could have been Santa. He had the twinkle in his eye, the stomach that shook like a bowl full of jelly, the white hair and thick white beard. And he had the disposition. Of course, I had to ask him: "So, are you Santa Claus?" He just smiled and said, "What do you think?"

With the first round of the NFL Draft wafting our way Thursday, now's the perfect time to pretend to be Chargers general manager and play "Which Player Should the Chargers Take in Round One?" Notice I say should, not will.
Trying to build upper-body strength always has been problematic for me largely because of a right-arm issue. I don't want to call it a disability; many have it much worse than I. Nor is it an excuse. But the fact is, at birth I was too wide coming out of my mom and got stuck. The right shoulder needed to be jammed into my torso, permanently damaging nerves. The result was limited range of motion (the right only raises half as high as the left) and an inability ever to achieve equal strength in both arms. Bench presses and push-ups, as two prime examples, can be exasperating.
But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable on its own terms. Director James Watkins, working from Jane Goldman's script, based on Susan Hill's novel, pushes all the right scary-movie buttons while creating a marvelously creepy atmosphere.

Subalpine forests and tundra are expected to decline as temperatures rise, while forests are expected to replace some grassland and shrubland in eastern Oregon. Increases in ocean temperatures could lead to more "dead zones" in productive nearshore waters.
The 11th district primary is scheduled for June but could be moved up if state legislators reach a deal over new congressional boundaries. As drawn now, the district covers Fudge's existing turf and a piece that stretches down to Akron. Lawmakers are committed to keeping the district one where a majority of the voters are minorities, so lines are unlikely to change much.
At least most of us do. Occasionally, somebody will slip. When that happens, it's usually messy.
Why it's hot: The weekly "Pulp the Party" helped spark a renaissance for subculture dance nights in Ybor City and beyond. No need to peacock here, folks; just let your freak flag fly. "It's about blowing off steam and not having to pop your collars or putting on a jacket," said mastermind Paul Geller, a.k.a. DJ Pauly Crush, of Orlando. "We take pride in delivering music that isn't being played at other clubs yet, or maybe ever will — certainly not on the radio." That means maintaining a core group of like-minded DJs with similar musical tastes; Geller even grooms new up-and-coming DJs to fill in. Pulp also brings quality drink specials, like a free keg of Stella Artois, $1 and $2 vodka drinks and free vodka shots when a snow machine goes off twice an hour. For Pulp's third anniversary party in July, they offered free drinks from 9 p.m. to midnight, and there was a line around the block to get in.

Defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk scored a goal that tied the score 1-1 deep into the first period. The play was a typical "Shatt Patrol" move. He read the situation, joined the offensive attack and converted a goal-mouth feed for his fifth goal of the season.
The Neurology study describes a trial in which 39 subjects -- 27 young boxers and 12 mixed-martial arts fighters -- were tested before and after sporting events in which they were at risk of concussion. Each boxer took the test twice before the the event; all the MMA fighters took it the day before an MMA event, at their weigh-in. After the sparring session, all seven boxers who had had overt blows to the head -- whether or not they lost consciousness -- were administered the military's screening test for concussion, the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation (or MACE), which takes 15 to 20 minutes to administer but is considered one of the most reliable tests for concussion. All of the MMA fighters took the MACE test afterward, whether or not they had received blows to the head.

Whoops, that was a little too optimistic.
Not to mention, you won't be in an amorous mood, either. When you infantilize your mate, you not only insult him, you also make him less masculine and desirable in your own eyes (which means you won't be as turned on by him). Additionally, by treating him like a child, you cause him to accept less responsibility, which only makes him less capable and powerful in your eyes.
"I had already fallen in love with Philadelphia," said Chantepie, who grew up north of Paris but was here for two years while working for Enterprise Rhône-Alpes International (ERAI), the international business-development agency of the Rhône-Alpes region of France. Lyon is the region's capital. The agency assists French companies interested in expanding to the United States and U.S. companies looking at that part of France. It created a Philadelphia office in 2009 at the Science Center.
Denise and Greg Pearson believe that houses, like people, deserve second chances. They recently finished the second and final renovation to their 110-year-old home.

† Don't let good per-weight prices lure you into buying large quantities. Unless you are running a restaurant, the industrial-size oregano is going to go bad before you can use it all. If you can't help yourself, split the container with a few friends. Share the cost and divide up the bounty in snack-size resealable bags or small jars with tight-fitting lids. You don't see spices sold in tins anymore for good reason: The metal didn't keep moisture out. Plus it rusted.
Arizona is booting the family from the one-acre parcel, arguing that the first Sussex descendant didn't even have a right to lease the land in 1892.

Pizzeria Ortica in Costa Mesa puts more emphasis on the pizzas, though the menu also offers the gamut of antipasti, salads, pastas and main courses. This is Sona and Comme Ça owner David Myers' first foray into Italian, with Steve Samson, whom you might remember as chef at Valentino a few years back, as chef de cuisine. Samson has made it his business to get the dough right, using a 300-year-old biga or sourdough starter from outside Naples, Italy (wonder how he got that baby through customs?). The thin crust has wonderful flavor and picks up some smokiness from the oven. Consider the Calabrese with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, rapini, hot little Calabrese peppers and shaved bottarga (dried pressed roe). The Margherita is classic, and you can add prosciutto and wild arugula to it, or salami and mushrooms. But the most unusual is the pie topped with fresh ricotta, guanciale, scallions and a dusting of fennel pollen. The place also has some terrific antipasti, such as house-cured yellowfin tuna with borlotti beans, charred octopus with potatoes and celery or carciofi (artichokes) alla Romana. Note: On the first and third Saturday of every month, Samson will be teaching a pizza class at the restaurant.
Close family friend Aretha Franklin, whom Houston lovingly called "Aunt Ree," had been expected to sing at the service, but said early Saturday she was too ill to attend.

A sampling of some of the controversies town councils have dealt with gives a clear indication of the difficulties, and downright dangers, of suburban life. In Ellisville, you might have to dodge an "atlatl," a modern version of a primitive spear used to hunt wildlife.
The depth of flavor from the Guinness marinade is enhanced by a touch of rich herb and garlic cheese that melts on the hot steak and onions. Freeze the cheese to make it easier to shave just enough on the top of the grilled steak and onions. This prevents too much cheese from being layered on when spreading the soft cheese.
Under the deal, the fair board would lease 20 acres to the not-for-profit Warren Township Development Association for $1 per year for 40 years. That association then would allow IMPD the use of the land.
I've been testing the Dell XPS 13, and there is a lot to like about it, even beyond its compact dimensions. I found it to be solid and well built, speedy and with a good, backlit keyboard, a bright screen, and good looks. It emerged from standby mode quickly and reliably. But this machine has a major downside: subpar battery life. In my standard test, it fell about an hour short of the longest-lived competing ultrabook I've tested and two hours short of the 13-inch MacBook Air.

After ATA lost Johnson County, the Metro's average daily ridership cratered. It dropped from 92,700 in 1981 to 61,600 a decade later. In recent years, it has been bumping along between 50,000 and 54,000, with a spike to 56,300 in 2008, when gasoline prices breached $4 a gallon. Average daily ridership, however, counts trips, not people. One person transferring makes two trips. The actual number of people on bus seats each day: about 30,000.

* Here's what I'm hoping to see from Adam Wainwright this evening at Wrigley Field: improved command. He's thrown his fastball 50 percent of the time, and it's been hittable, as we know. Opponents are batting .333 against the fastball, with a .704 slugging percentage. But the problem is more location than velocity. Wainwright has left too many fastballs over the belly of the plate; 60 percent have been in the strike zone, and he isn't getting it past many hitters who seem to be looking for it. But it's more than just the fastball; if Wainwright can have sharper command of his secondary pitches, it would make his fastball more effective. The famous Wainwright curve has been all over the place; he's thrown it in the zone only 30 percent of the time. (But on a positive note, he is getting hitters to chase it.) I've said it before, but this is a process for Wainwright. Be patient.

Her opening scene is of a doctor pronouncing her stricken father brain-dead and his fight to live on -- which he did for those many years, though she wished for the family's life before the stroke.

Dozens of vendors will line seven blocks of North Union Avenue on Sunday, selling food, crafts and services. Bands will perform live music in one of the street’s plazas, while patrons can walk past classic cars lining the street and go on carnival rides.
Condon was more often humorous than not, and his columns could meander from one topic to another, like a casual conversation. On this occasion, the appearance of an overwrought headline in his own newspaper produced a column that began, improbably, with the time he was working in a faucet factory as well as editing copy for a newspaper.
