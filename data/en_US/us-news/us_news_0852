MacDonald, who was born in Seattle, insisted that she lived "a perfectly ordinary life." But there was nothing ordinary about her success in turning the absurdities of her life — raising chickens alongside the kids, trying to find work during the Great Depression — into books that still feel absolutely modern to today's readers.

While the hit show "CSI" has kindled interest in this career path, serious potential applicants should know a few more things about their "dream field." In addition to mopping up blood, the day of a crime scene cleaner can also include ripping up carpet and floorboards, working in extremely tight spaces, and unearthing bodily fluids and evidence from asbestos-filled buildings. Crime scene cleaners who are lucky enough to get called into a drug lab will get the extra joy of gingerly handling combustible chemicals and compounds while they strive to do their jobs. If none of this phases you, however, an average salary of $50,400 is yours for the taking. If you're interested in job opportunities that pay $34,000 and up, requiring no more than a high school diploma and a training course, the embalming of dead people might be right up your alley! While you will need a license, embalming is a textbook example of a job the world will always need that most people will not want. This walks readers through both the nature of the work and the process of actually getting into the field. Flight engineer 120k In flight service manager

TAMPA, Fla. — Andy Pettitte described the feeling as “weird.” But he was not saying it felt strange to be back in the Yankee clubhouse, putting on the pinstripes again and going out to throw about 50 pitches in the bullpen after a year away from the game. What Pettitte said was, “It felt weird, because it doesn’t seem like I’ve been away at all.”

The news spread quickly in South Korea, which imposed a ban on U.S. beef in 2003 along with China and other countries because of mad cow disease concerns. Seoul's resumption of U.S. beef imports in 2008 sparked daily candlelight vigils and street protests for several months as many South Koreans still regarded the meat as a public health risk.

"It was bad communication on my behalf," said Wallace, who called for the run play with 11 seconds left instead of spiking the ball. "At that point, it's not the head coach's fault. It's my job to make sure I get everybody on the right page. At that point in the game, the crowd is into it and it's tough. I'm not making any excuses. At the end of the day I've got to make sure we're in the right situation to get points out of it."

"Starhawk" adds a nifty strategic element: Killing Outcasts earns you rift energy, which you can spend to build offensive or defensive structures. You can build walls, watchtowers or turrets to defend your turf, or you can call up garages that squirt out land speeders or fighter jets.
It was only the second time in the National Weather Service's history that the agency labeled an approaching storm system as "high risk" more than 24 hours in advance. The other time was in April 2006, when nearly 100 tornadoes raked across the southeastern U.S.
"The demons that have so fatally tormented European history—most disastrously of all in the 20th century—are merely biding their time," Havel once warned, stressing that Europe's prosperous West and formerly Communist East must seek unity. "Just as one-half of a room cannot remain forever warm while the other half is cold, it is equally unthinkable that two different Europes could forever live side by side without detriment to both."
At Tokyo's railway station, hordes of people were making their way home after spending the night stranded in the capital.
The ultimate objective, Broadbent and scriptwriter Ol Parker said, was to make a film that wasn't a soft-lens, idealized vision of India, nor something in the so-called poverty porn genre focused on feel-good underdogs. "It's for others to judge whether we succeeded," Parker said. "You can't please everyone. I await the response with pleasure and terror."

Mark Edelson, a 2010 UMd Law graduate, works as an associate at a small Lutherville firm. He groups himself in "a lucky minority" of young attorneys doing what originally motivated them to go to law school. Still, his fulfillment comes at a cost.

But truth, like beauty, comes in many packages, and if "Then Again" is not a beautiful book, it seems like a truthful one, revealing a woman still plagued by insecurities, though not enough to keep her from being an actor or writing a memoir, and weighted down with regrets, though not so many to keep her from adopting two children at an age when most women are surveying an empty nest.

The Dodgers are working on finding a way to let fans get autographs before games, a team spokesman said. The club found a temporary solution Wednesday, allowing fans to form a line down an aisle that runs alongside the home dugout. Javy Guerra and Kenley Jansen signed for about three minutes. Third base coach Tim Wallach was also there for a few minutes. Clayton Kershaw dropped by for about a minute. A group that included three children didn't reach the front of the line to get autographs from any of them, but hitting coach Dave Hansen came by. … Nathan Eovaldi started for double-A Chattanooga but was pulled after one inning. Mattingly said Eovaldi won't be replacing anyone in the major league rotation but indicated he could be taking someone's spot in the bullpen.

There are two ways to do this: The hard way is to turn over the soil one spade depth, then pile that somewhere. Till up the next level beneath that. When that's done, return the soil you set aside. The cheater's way is to rototill or hand spade to one depth, then buy some good topsoil to raise the bed about 1 foot. Raised beds also have good drainage, which makes for healthier plants.

Don Markus: Smotrycz'sinterest in Maryland is interesting, considering that he wasn't exactly warming the bench for the Wolverines. I realize that his playing time might have dwindled with the arrival of Mitch McGary in Ann Arbor, but he's coming to a pretty crowded frontcourt with the Terps as well. I think a lot of Smotrycz's playing time a year from now will depend on the development of freshmen Shaquille Cleare and Jake Layman. Smotrycz is a bigger, stronger version of Layman, but if Layman puts on muscle his first year in College Park they might essentially be the same player -- a face-up power forward. If Layman remains more of a small forward, then it makes perfect sense and it will be a matter of finding a rotation that could also include Alex Len if he's still at Maryland by that point.
Mason will serve at least until his term ends in January 2013, since his office continues as is under the charter.

After the market collapse in several years ago, Kinkade suffered from signs of real estate fatigue: Franchisee lawsuits, a distaste for the now-faded housing obsession and widely reported scenes of Kinkade becoming publicly drunk and disruptive (he was arrested for allegedly drunken driving in Carmel, Calif., two years ago) all contributed to the bankruptcy of Pacific Metro, his production company, in 2010. But the near ubiquity of his work in doctor’s offices and real estate agencies will be slow to disappear — not unlike the lingering effects of the conservative economic/cultural boom that he rode so well for almost two decades.
Marshalek was among the 25 percent in the poll who say they plan to never retire. People who are unmarried, earn under $50,000 a year, or say they did a poor job of financial planning are disproportionately represented among that group.

For years, air travelers have complained that airlines weren't adequately disclosing these so-called ancillary fees - indeed, that airlines were benefiting from a widespread assumption that checking a bag was included in the airfare, as it still is on Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways. But on Aug. 23, a new Department of Transportation regulation went into effect, requiring airlines to disclose all fees for optional services through a prominent link on their websites. It's just the first volley in what could be a protracted war between airlines and the government over fee disclosure.

The challenge in introducing any unfamiliar cuisine to a wider audience is trying to find the balance of so-called "authenticity'' while still making it accessible to novices. In that regard, the Mitras and Kumar do a superb job. The food might not be as fiery as you'll find in Tamil Nadu, but for the most part it has a balanced heat.
The highlight of Friday, which was mostly spent working in my hotel room, was going to see Harvard play Penn at the Palestra. I can't stress this enough: If you ever get a chance to see a game at the Palestra, do it. It's a marvelous venue, old but not antiquated and dripping with history. It feels like the whole place is naturally sepia-toned. A Philadelphia colleague told me the worst thing the Atlantic 10 ever did was move the conference tournament out of the Palestra. Yes, the closest parking is about 3 blocks away and I'm sure the locker room facilities are lacking, but it's just a great place to watch a game.

Food may be the greatest ally in switching your partner's wine preference. If you serve a plate of oysters on the half shell, a Muscadet's citrusy and briny flavors with hints of minerality make for a classic pairing that can be irresistible, even to the avid Cabernet Sauvignon drinker. Duck breasts served with a silky, smooth Pinot Noir can be a temptation for the Chardonnay-only quaffer.

Although Zack and Miri contains plenty of raunchy language, it contains no actual explicit sex scenes (although it does have several pretty convincing simulated ones). In addition to Morgan, the movie's cast includes adult actress Traci Lords, whose character, "Bubbles," enthusiastically lends her peculiar anatomical skills to Zack and Miri's cinematic enterprise.
Card issuers deal with consumers on disputes, but they have to follow rules set by the card networks to make a chargeback to the merchant, said Chase spokesman Rob Tacey.

Prosecutors frequently appear before Toomin and the 13 judges he supervises in juvenile court on a wide range of matters. In the Koschman case, though, the prosecutor's office is, in effect, defending itself, arguing that there is no reason to question its impartiality nor to question whether the agency has a conflict of interest in reviewing a case in which the conduct of prosecutors has been questioned.
In Iowa, the maps are drawn by nonpartisan legislative staffers following strict protocol laid out in state law. The focus is on keeping communities of interest together and equalizing representation. Politics is not a consideration.

Germany sees the problem differently. It is adamant there should be no official-sector involvement, and it opposes filling a growing gap in Greek finances by making more loans from governments.

Personally, I was anxious about how the American public would react, but with the president's response, I feel relieved. Ever since that lunch period in third grade on 9/11, I felt my name and my religion under attack.

My view changed when my wife, Dorothy, and I moved to Los Angeles in 1983. She and her mother had been born here, although when Dorothy was 9 they moved to her father's Kentucky hometown because the real estate fortune he had hoped to make in L.A. had never materialized. So there was a personal history in Southern California, if not the kind of history with a capital "H" I was used to from Philadelphia. We settled in Los Feliz because we wanted a house that looked like those we had seen in movies, particularly film noirs like "Double Indemnity": a Spanish Colonial with citrus trees and a pool in the backyard.

Most overblown issue No. 1: TSA scanners and body searches. No travel issue got more clicks on the Web, hours on talk radio and pages in newspapers than the supposed uprising brewing at Thanksgiving over the new full-body scan detectors and the more invasive body searches for those who opted out.

There's really no trickery here from Lynn, though I should point out that he's put the curve to good use.

The language of amendments being considered this year would create a particularly difficult situation as they require spending be limited to 18 percent of gross domestic product.

After the property was sold in 1974 to be subdivided, I (like many longtime residents) was afraid the house, which dates back to 1857, would be torn down.

Hubby and I ate there a few times and were sad when it closed years later. Again, I feared for the fate of the old house and the bit of acreage left around it, as it was a wonderful landmark for many of us St. Charles area natives.

What is left unsaid by Ms. Casagrande is that if income taxes are reduced or eliminated, as she suggests, how will that loss of income be made up? If the income tax is not replaced, what services will be cut? Will the burden just be shifted to the municipalities, as has already happened, with the glib statement that we should live within their means? Assemblywoman Casagrande offers no suggestions, nor do any of her Republican colleagues.

Before I know it, we're packed into my Fury, with Bob at my shoulder and Lynch beside him taking pictures. We head north on Broadway, through the gauntlet of liquor stores and scrap yards. "This reminds me of my father's movie 'Eraserhead,'" says Lynch, whose own debut was 1993's nightmarish "Boxing Helena." "It's like this town has already been art-directed for us."
A: I would have previously said Eddy Curry and Terrel Harris. Now I think Harris dresses. I would say Curry and possibly Juwan Howard or Dexter Pittman. But remember, unlike the previous rules, it now is a game-by-game decision, so it likely comes down to whether they're playing a team with a bona fide center. Against a team like Boston, I could see both Curry and Pittman inactive.

Today, aquariums have grown so large that, as you observe the fish, you can walk through glass tunnels that seemingly take you into their world. Brunner dislikes these, just as he does the notion of aquariums in general: He says they accomplish nothing except the imprisonment of fish and undersea plants. He brings this book, which offers readers another display of his trademark thoughtfulness, to a close by suggesting that we need to pay better attention to what aquariums imitate – the actual realms of Oceanus and Poseidon.

What's grown more satisfying over the years since 1994, when Helgi Tomasson unveiled his version of Shakespeare's classic drama of ill-fated lovers, is the legibility of the storytelling and the briskness with which Tomasson unrolls his tale. The central piazza in designer Jens-Jacob Worsaae's Renaissance Verona still feels more crammed than Juliet's bedroom, but with small details deftly inserted into key scenes, there is a lot more clarity onstage.

But Black deserves a mulligan. His team has stunk out April, to the point of all but being out of the National League West race without venturing east of Denver. So Bud hasn't been sleeping well, trying to figure out why his kids can't hit, can't hit for average, can't hit with runners in scoring position, strike out more than any team, can't field worth a damn and often run the bases as if escaping a burning building.

My own bookshelves are conventionally functional, unlike many of the bookshelves pictured in Mr. Johnson's paean to the physicality of the bound and printed word. Many of the featured bookshelves are more like sculpture than furniture, but they nonetheless store books. One shelf holds not only a pile of books but also a bicycle. Another set of shelves is built into the sides of a sculpted cow. If bookshelves eventually go the way of spinning wheels and washboards, Mr. Johnson's book will remind our descendants of the whimsy and glory of making theater out of book storage.

This was Halladay’s first start since one of the most un-Doc-like starts of the two-time Cy Young Award winner’s career. Halladay left his previous start in Atlanta an overheated mess after squandering a 6-0 lead and allowing eight runs for just the fifth time in 359 career starts. Lack of velocity had become a real concern after that wild night in Atlanta, and the Phillies had to be at least a little curious to see what Halladay would bring to the mound against the Mets.

About an hour before dusk one day last winter, my husband, Tom, and I headed to the nearby 16,700-acre Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area.

The middle 10 percent is all that matters. Quick lesson - and geez, I hope I'm not the one to tell you this: 45 percent of the country are die-hard Republican religious fundamentalists who'd vote for Bull Connor if he promised to end abortion, ban gay marriage and get prayer back into the public schools. Why? Because their minds are stuck in Mayberry in 1955 and they won't let go. In case you haven't watched the "Andy Griffith Show" lately, I'll summarize the place of black people in Mayberry: nowhere (or, to be precise, occasionallly glimpsed in the background, quietly going about their business).

I know most of the council's members and am not unsympathetic to the disgust of its majority.

And there's the age-old debate that will be put to the ultimate test Monday: Is it, or is it not, an advantage for hitters when they face the same pitcher for the second time within a week?

I’m a good runner and I work hard,” Stilin said, “and that kind of defines me.”

Smith, 69, has always played in a youthful, funky vein and is widely known for his collaborations with guitarist George Benson more than 40 years ago. It’s no surprise to find him working again with a group of ambitious upstarts; his style will mesh well with this group of forward-thinking players who grew up immersed in the funk and soul sounds pioneered by Smith and his contemporaries.
I was somewhere in between. The Manu was more restrained than some New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs I've had. It had a nicely balanced bouquet of citrus, herbs and tropical fruit that was quite tasty. However, it was better with food than alone. This is a flavorful wine with a zesty acidity and a clean, crisp fairly long finish. It went well with the mango salsa that Lois used to top the salmon, and with the chile, lime and Parmesan rub she used on the grilled corn-on-the-cob.
Hambrick attributed the increase in profitability to increasing volumes of chemical sales coupled with higher prices and customers choosing more expensive products. He added that higher pricing and a better product mix more than made up for rising raw material prices.

The petite spa (five treatment rooms, two showers, one steam room) is done up in the now-standard glass tile, cool stone and soft lighting. Design gets priority: The angular pedicure chair offered little back support, and the glass foot bowl was undersized for my Sasquatch stompers.
In the documents obtained by the Associated Press, the courthouse facilities that could close were ranked based on a variety of categories, including cost, usage and location. Maryland's was among the top 10 sites being considered for closure.

Red: It's a matter of debate whether Zinfandel should see the Thanksgiving table, probably because Zin isn't the wine it once was. The 2009 Broc Cellars Vine Starr California Red ($25, 13.5%) provides that perfect exception. Made of 95 percent Zin and a whack of Syrah, its fresh raspberry and ground pepper makes it one of the most impressive young-drinking California reds I've encountered all year.

At least he was cooking, too, smartly roasting those spring tomatoes in the pan to enhance their tenderness, and pairing them with a milky cloud of cream-stuffed burrata cheese. Likewise, I loved the appetizer of French snails simply tossed with hand-cranked noodles, zucchini laces, and a hit of Fresno pepper to warm the butter-garlic sauce. The wonderfully refreshing Carolina chop salad, molded into a pedestal of crunchy romaine studded with crab, shrimp, and the campfire tang of smoked tomato vinaigrette, has the look of a Chestnut Hill classic. The fresh-fried doughnuts whose holes are stuffed with apple-pie filling could become a draw in themselves as well.

No wonder the Vatican is nervous. I imagine if they don't take action soon, they'll have to admit the nuns have gone AWOL, have become crazy with power, have become wild, feral, hysterical. And you know what they do with hysterical women, don't you? Oh, I bet you do.
One of those, a party planner in Akron, said she met "Rod Eric" in a bar in late April. In retrospect, the woman said, she realized he approached her after overhearing her talk about a benefit she was helping coordinate.
Sometimes people think we're British, partly because the music has some influences from English bands from the past. Why it connects internationally is hard to say. I think the lyrics are very personal confessions or whatever, but the topics are universal in some ways. We are always a little surprised, especially in countries where English is not the first language but they get really into it.

Start with a devil crab, a Tampa staple ($3.25). It looks like a standard version but it's so stuffed with crab you'll wonder why the rest aren't like this. Same with another Tampa favorite, the crab enchilado — red sauce thickened with blue crab and served over angel hair pasta. It's a Friday special all day ($8.45), and available most nights ($8.95). This is abuela's recipe, but with a lot more crab, and is Castillo's signature dish.

Dozens of emails and texts that passed between Adam Smith, a special adviser to Mr. Hunt, and Frederic Michel, News Corp.'s director of public affairs, appear to show the pair essentially strategizing together to win approval for the deal and comparing notes about an "opposition" that included other media outlets and the Labour Party.

"Becoming Chaz " surveys a year in the life of Chaz Bono, born Chastity Bono in 1969 and often trotted out to act cute at the end of TV's "The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour" when she was a small child. Yes, Cher is in the film, but only minimally and, frankly, she's almost beside the real point. If she has issues trying to accept that her daughter is now her son, they really are no different than the issues many parents, friends and siblings have to confront, even if they aren't chatting with David Letterman. The film is honest, informative, beautifully made and inspiring as it follows Chaz through breast removal surgery and during his first year of transitioning. A stunning documentary.
øI have also focused on being a better leader. This year our team had so many new people that needed to get adjusted to our system and a new coaching staff. I know (from experience) that sometimes when you're new, people tend to just go with the flow while they trying to fit in. So, I felt like my responsibility was and has been to make the transition easier.
“The proposal to cut income taxes by 10 percent, if you took a family with an average income of $50,000 -- which, by the way, $57,000 is the mean in our state -- that would provide $80 over a three-year period in the pockets of a New Jersey family. That is not anything of significance. We say that won't buy a bag of groceries for a working-class family,” Oliver said.
Brewer's announcement came not at the Capitol, but at a hard-to-find human resource center used by the state Department of Transportation, about 2 miles northeast of the state's executive office and near a major freeway interchange. There were no protesters there.
There's so much going on in "Jackie Brown" — the ensemble cast, the infectious score, the force of nature that is Pam Grier — that it's rare to hear Quentin Tarantino's 1997 valentine to Grier's career characterized as a "heist" movie. But "JB" is one of the best, and deserves to be put on a pedestal alongside "Rififi" and "The Killing." It's also Tarantino's most adult movie to date. No caricatures, no trendy dancing, no set pieces Xeroxed from treasured genre memories — you can believe everything you see on the screen.

Their styles are different. Steven looks and trains like a Marine, wearing a crew-cut and rising early each day to follow a strict regimen. In addition to jumping for three hours a day, Steven goes to a gym most nights to work with weights, do exercises to strengthen his core or swim sprints across the pool. He keeps meticulous notes of his practices. His sports psychologist urges him to take time off training, Steven says, but in order to aim for the Olympics, Steven put college on hold.
Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has roughly the same amount of backing in polls as he did in 2008 when he lost the race with 25 percent of the vote amid skepticism over his Mormon faith and reversals on some social issues.

øMore troubling for Underwood was a sudden dry spell at the awards show that she has co-hosted since 2008. After winning five CMA Awards in three years, including three for female vocalist of the year, many industry observers figured she'd be a lock for entertainer-of-the-year nominations.

After a day at the temples, I like to head to Nishiki Market, a wonderful little world of inexpensive thrills in an expensive city. The narrow, covered arcade with stalls that sell everything -- a variety of seaweed, dried fish with the heads still on, soy doughnuts, octopus balls, dozens of varieties of saki (the very best are cold), roasted coarse green tea, incense, candles, Hello Kitty dolls, kimonos, some kind of huge vegetable slathered in a brown paste, the traditional Kyoto gelatinous Warabi mochi bean cakes, kitchen utensils and daito, a kind of pickled radish.
