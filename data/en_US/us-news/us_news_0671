In the vigorous “Montilla,” a driving beat tumbles out against wailing vocals. The rapidfire singing in the colorfully orchestrated “El curruchà” also charms. There is striking variety here, including a few selections with a bright sound calling to mind Caribbean music. A contrapuntal prelude by Tarquinio Merlua leads compellingly into a modern song by Adela Gleijer. Among mostly pop-oriented singers, countertenor Phillippe Jaroussky adapts well, sounding fairly natural in folk melodies. He knows how to build intensity throughout a slow-building number. A drawback: A few ballads verge into easy-listening territory, particularly in the verses of the title track, an arrangement of an Astor Piazzolla piece.
Heidi tells Gretchen that she did the most backpedaling. And A.J. came up with an ill-fitting flight attendant outfit. Gretchen is....in. She goes backstage, and tells the others she's in, "barely," and that the judges called her out. She says she takes responsibility for the things they called her out on.
Part of Puck's genius is his instinctual feel for what people in Southern California want to eat. And his food here via executive chef Sonny Sweetman and chef de cuisine Ray Weber relies on top-flight ingredients and deft execution. The menu reads a bit cautious (it's a hotel, after all), but not stodgy. And, against trend, he hasn't gone in for a pounding rock soundtrack. The Bel-Air is one of the few restaurants in town where it's quiet enough for conversation. The terrace especially gives a sense of privacy and romance.
Though 76ers coach Doug Collins pointed out seven of the Bulls' mere eight turnovers came off 76ers steals, immediately placing them in transition, the mostly solid ball protection pointed to a larger issue — the offense.
The bill squeaked through the committee 3-2, with senators who voted for it stressing that they might change their minds if it comes to the Senate floor. Before that can happen, however, the measure will have to run another gauntlet in the Senate Appropriations Committee.

“It’s not like we’re going away from Camby,” McMillan said. “It’s just that I’m looking to start out with a team that’s going to be aggressive. Camby is still going to be in there and he’s going to be playing.”
Besides the Santa Anita Derby, there were two other graded stakes races on Saturday's 11-race card, and Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith won both of those to get to 5,000 wins in his career. He won aboard Lady of Shamrock in the $150,000 Providencia Stakes and Amazombie in the $150,000 Protero Grade Stakes. Amazombie won last year's Breeders' Cup Sprint.
It is the same violation of values, except we see ourselves as a person in the emergency room who shouldn't be bothered with finances and we can't imagine a situation where we couldn't pay for the other health care ourselves.
Throughout the music's history, drummers have offered plenty of evidence to that effect, from Elvin Jones supremely accompanying John Coltrane to Tony Williams engaging in telepathic rapport with Miles Davis. And Dafnis Prieto has been recognized as a worthy successor.

In his complaint to the state bar, Hargreaves said the law does not allow for the magistrate hold.
Asked Tuesday if he believes beating Mosley will get him the Mayweather fight, Alvarez said, "Yes, better days are ahead of me by winning this fight.
Building on the idea of a palimpsest, or a document on which new texts are written over old ones, Kahane draws from Hart Crane's poem "The Bridge" and his own lyrics. Throughout the 22-minute score, though, musical styles tend not to merge but graciously flow one into the next. The orchestra writing is atmospheric, favoring color (particularly with percussion) and eerie strings. Kahane's singing style can be pop-flavored with his own emotion-worn-on-the-sleeve lyrics and more coolly classical for Crane's intricate stanzas.

"The thing that concerns me about her is her inexperience with government," said Gonzalez, a Democrat. "There's a lot of people's lives at stake with her decisions."
A. Shock. But there were enough friends darting about, trying to cheer them up. "Look, you might as well let him, he obviously can't do anything else!" And I'd been sort of doing it since I was a child. We used to read the classics aloud after dinner - an old Victorian custom, a very nice custom, actually. So the feeling was, "Oh, the boy does it anyway. At least, let him get paid for it, for Christ's sake!"

In the real world, there's no reason Colton Dixon would be made to sing a Stevie Wonder song. As Jimmy Iovine suggested, "This is not his wheelhouse." But there's never been much patience for the real world on reality TV. And so it was that Dixon came to shock us all while reminding America than emo is short for "emotional" with a vulnerable reading of "Lately" that ended on a sweet falsetto note. Extremely well done, fauxhawked wonder.
After devoting six of its first seven picks to offense, Washington took SMU cornerback Richard Crawford and Iowa strong safety Jordan Bernstine with its seventh-round selections. Bernstine was a cornerback until his senior season.

There is a significant dropoff between the Luck-Griffin duo to Tannehill—more than six spots worth. There also is a natural fit, given Tannehill played under Dolphins offensive coordinator Mike Sherman at Texas A&M. But unless they are completely convinced the former Aggie—not nearly a polished product—is that long-awaited franchise guy, it's better for Dolphins to pass.
It is art for the ages.
Next, ask for more information on the stuff that doesn't sit right. For example, if his visiting "the one who got away" bugs you, then you need(ed) to tell him (preferably pre-trip) that you want to be the cool girlfriend and high-five this friendship, but you can't shake the memory of his drunken pining for her. It's not either-or, silent sufferer or jealous harpy.
Still, the Browns had to hold off the Bengals one last time after Anderson took over at quarterback for second-year pro Jack Thompson.
That last trend is the most significant, because it's not just about frugal parents momentarily prohibiting kids from driving during an oil-price spike. It's also about young people's preferences. As The New York Times just reported, "Many young consumers today just do not care that much about cars," as evidenced by an 18 percent drop in teen driver's licenses between 1998 and 2008. A generation ago, Ferris Bueller said that getting a computer instead of a car proved that he was "born under a bad sign" -- but The Times cites a new poll showing that 46 percent of today's 18- to 24-year-olds say they would actually "choose Internet access over owning a car."

The Kingdom Tower will rise from the middle of a brand-new, $20-billion mixed-use development laid out by the American firm HOK Architects. Its first few floors will hold offices, but after that it will be filled with a Four Seasons hotel and dozens upon dozens of residential floors. The tower's most noticeable formal flourish is a terrace jutting out from the 157th floor; it is not an observatory for the public but a private outdoor space for the skyscraper's penthouse — a front yard more than 3,000 feet in the air.

May's elections, 20 years after the collapse of Communism, swept away a large number of the country's predominantly male, entrenched career politicians. In their place have come a crop of new faces, including more women and twenty-somethings. There are now 44 female members of the 200-person lower house of the Czech parliament. The speaker, Miroslava Nemcova, of the conservative Civic Democratic Party is a woman—the first to hold the post. So are two of her three deputies.

We don't relish the thought of paying more for gasoline — working families feel that pinch, too — but we have yet to hear about any alternative to a gas tax increase that makes much sense. Somebody has to pay to maintain and upgrade Maryland's highways, bridges, public transportation, bustling port and airport. And the more of that burden falls the users of those facilities (with those who use them more paying more) surely the better.
The image has become part of pop culture, "used by everyone from Warhol to Hollywood to cartoons to teacups and T-shirts," said Michael Frahm of the London-based art advisory service firm Frahm Ltd. "Together with the Mona Lisa, it's the most famous and recognized image in art history."

The incentive package encountered opposition from the city's TIF Commission, which refused its recommendation. That means at least five of the six council members and the mayor must vote in favor of the TIF legislation. Normally, a simple majority of four would be needed.
Good news can cascade in the same way that bad news piles up. In the past week, for example, Magna International Inc. announced it is opening a plant in south Phoenix to make parts for solar panels. Within three years, the plant is expected to create 150 jobs with average annual wages of over $45,000, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority. The Gila River Indian Community announced that it will break ground next year on casino and hotel projects, valued at $160million, at its Lone Butte and Vee Quiva casinos in metro Phoenix. The work is projected to create 700 construction jobs and 400 permanent positions.

And scoring a goal isn't? This season, among NHL players who participated in 70 or more games, the most accurate shooter was Tampa Bay centerman Steven Stamkos. He scored on 60 of the 303 times he put pucks on the net. That's a 19.8 shooting percentage. Or to put it another way, Stamkos failed four out of every five times he shot.

On the face of it, Muse is a quintessential "hotel dining room" and offers a fairly predictable hotel restaurant menu emphasizing big proteins like steaks, chops, fish and roasted chicken. In a certain light, both observations are correct. The Ritz-Carlton Cleveland's main restaurant is the kind of clubby space that comforts a travel-weary executive with all-American offerings that won't jar anyone's sensibilities. On second glance, Muse sports a light, contemporary freshness that exceeds preconceptions. While any number of downtown restaurants offer more exciting menus (specials and seasonal menus lend jazz to the selection), at Muse the preparation of dishes is every bit as buttoned down as the bill of fare. Perfectly sauteed shiitake and button mushrooms are lined in regimental order atop a flavorful New York strip steak grilled just as requested. A beautiful crab cake, lightly packed with scarcely a hint of crumbs or other binders, seasoned with restraint and large enough to satisfy as a light entree, could be held up as the definition of perfection. Even seemingly minor players -- a refreshing arugula-and-butternut squash salad, creamy fingerling potatoes, seductive butter-sauteed and parmesan-laced brussels sprouts and spot-on bearnaise and veal demiglace sauces -- all deserve curtain calls. Gratifying to know that Cleveland's dining renaissance resonates even in the halls of a corporate bastion such as this.
As it turns out, he says, the extra altitude is actually good for the flavor of the coffee. Because temperatures are cooler, he only gets three crops every four years instead of the usual annual harvest, which allows the beans more time to hang on the trees and ripen.
They also found areas where someone could cross the perimeter without activating the alarms; one captain said he had tried to report the problem and had been told to keep quiet.

We cranked up the heat and asked for medium for our vegetarian Mastani Palak ($8.95) and Mutter Paneer ($8.95) (We've learned from experience that Jaipur Junction likes it hot, so aim a bit milder in your requests than you do at most Indian restaurants.) The Mastani Palak, spinach cooked in freshly ground spices with chickpeas, was indeed spicy, but had a nice earthy taste in the peas and spinach. And the Mutter Paneer's homemade cheese cubes were mouth-meltingly good, delicate chunks swimming in a light curry with green peas. Both were served with heaping bowls of fluffy saffron rice pilaf ($1.95).

So not only do I watch the games, but I root for a favorite player who throws himself into the game with energy, skill and passion.

Ottway fits into the latter camp, suicidal over not being with his wife (Anne Openshaw, seen in flashbacks). There is more to that story, we learn, but the effect is the same: Life for Ottway is no longer worth living.

Lloyd and Morgan's intention is telegraphed from the opening scenes, when a simple trip to the grocery store for a now-unsteady Thatcher becomes a confusing difficulty for her and a frightening surprise for her caretakers when they discover she's gone. The movie unfolds over just a few days plucked from the filmmakers' imaginations, looking in on Thatcher when she finally starts packing up her late husband's clothes. As happens in times like these, small things trigger memories, the distant past coming more easily to mind than the day's agenda. She finds herself frequently drifting back in time, which the director uses as a device to fill in the primary trajectory of her roughly 40-year political career — snapshots of various triumphs, her failures less so.
So, all of this is reason enough for movie buffs to check out Hugo. But what about the kids and families who have no connection to Méliès, little familiarity with Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton? Will Hugo keep them in their seats?
The issue of the surplus comes down to the basic issue of transparency. Instead of telling faculty that their salaries are causing a financial crisis, PSU needs to have a completely open conversation about how the pie is being divided -- and not the pie after the administration has taken out what it claims it needs. We need to ask where the money is going. We need answers to basic questions: Why have the number of administrators, as well as their salaries, increased at a much greater rate than full-time faculty? Why do administrators and coaches make $140,000 and up when more and more faculty earn poverty wages with no benefits? Why do we continue to fund sports when the programs lose more than $1 million a year? Does the quest for more out-of-state students lead to spending on nonessential items and buildings that in the end don't pay for themselves? Will PSU's proposed model of employing more adjuncts at poverty wages lead to such a decline in quality that enrollment will decrease as students -- in-state or out-of-state -- begin to wonder whether a PSU education is a wise investment?

Yarn-covered pumpkin: This is a great way to add texture to your pumpkin display. Choose a sparkly orange or black yarn. Coat your pumpkin with a thick layer of white craft glue and wrap it with the yarn - either in a random pattern, swirls or even rows.
Romney spoke at the school's commencement and received his most enthusiastic response when he reiterated his view that "marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman."

Moments before former Titans' great Eddie George announced the pick in front of a podium at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, Brown's cell phone buzzed.

In the end, it wasn't hard to figure out what did SLU in. The Billikens shot 35.3 percent from the field, their second-worst shooting performance of the season. In the first half, SLU shot 23.8 percent, making just five field goals. (At the half, SLU had one fewer field goals than turnovers.) The Billikens missed some layins, missed some free throws and shot 28 percent on 3-point shots. For a No. 9 seed to knock off a No. 1 seed, those numbers don't work.
Philip Markoff was not required to attend today's session in Boston Municipal Court, which his lawyer said was "not a critical stage" in his case.
He acknowledged that, to some, the mansion was a symbol of US Fidelis' abuses. The company's founder, Darain Atkinson, financed its construction with company revenue from the high-pressure and deceptive sales of practically worthless extended auto-service contracts, regulators allege.
It's happening in Sacramento right now. Last week, we learned that the local diocese stopped funding Francis House, one of the largest homeless charities in the region. They did so because the Rev.

This book is written with enough holes to leave readers judging Grace and the others for themselves.
øBut A Natural Woman is hardly a sob story. There's more humor and joy than pathos; and predictably, many of the happy moments involve music. There are leisurely, detailed accounts of recording sessions, and of collaborations, friendships and memorable encounters with fellow icons such as John Lennon and James Taylor.
The trade-off, they said, is texture. The meat generally becomes tackier.
Straddling the line between melody and melodrama without plunging into a well of simpering pathos has always been this country band's recipe for crossover success. Their latest album, "Own the Night," has owned the charts, finding just enough twang and grit for country traditionalists without abandoning pop sensibilities for the adult-contemporary crowd. Will their recent chart- topper "Just a Kiss" and crowd favorite "Need You Now" resonate in that echo chamber known as P.B. Pav? Singers Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott no doubt will emote enthusiastically enough to cough up a lung.

To deflect responsibility in the patient claims, the hospital wants to avoid saying that Midei caused harm, said some lawyers involved in the cases and some who aren't, even though St. Joseph publicly suggested he had through the mailings.

Cy Young winners Tim Lincecum and Clayton Kershaw will miss facing each other by one day because of the way the rotations are lined up.

Miller's books are not available digitally; they're out of print and still in copyright, a literary limbo of the lost. Hundreds of thousands of other titles are available, however — both by leading figures such as Shakespeare, Dickens and Tolstoy and by those (George Gissing, for instance, or Sherwood Anderson) who could benefit from rediscovery. My iPad holds all that and more: Henry Fielding, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Friedrich Nietzsche staring into the void. It collects "Common Sense" and "The Federalist Papers," as it's useful to remember where we came from, if only to see how far we've strayed.

A week later after the Ravens’ AFC championship game loss to the New England Patriots, Reed left the locker room without speaking to reporters. However, he did belt out a couple of lines from the Teddy Pendergrass song, “Love TKO” as he walked out of the building, singing, “I think I better let it go …”

This time, the Republican is hoping to fill the seat being vacated by the retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent.

I wish I'd videotaped our scramble to claim the new site, especially the decamping of the tent. Three of us were bunking in the bus, which popped out to sleep four, two up and two down.

The question of how much Oshie, one of the Blues' most skilled players, can contribute offensively at the NHL level has been asked since his arrival from the University of North Dakota. A first-round pick in 2005, he scored 59 goals and had 142 points in 129 games with the Fighting Sioux, but in the professional ranks, the points haven't come as easily. He has 63 goals and 175 points in 262 regular-season games, including career highs this season with 19 goals and 54 points in 80 games. But similar to his college career, Oshie provides the Blues with many intangibles, and often times his dogged play doesn't lead to prime-time scoring chances.

Lawrence's reputation — or at least, his legend — was secured for future generations by Peter O'Toole's performance in David Lean's wildly honored 1962 film epic, "Lawrence of Arabia," something of a landmark in an era of monumental films and one that Steven Spielberg has called "a miracle." Korda tells a particularly engaging anecdote about how his uncle, filmmaker Alexander Korda, came to sell the rights to Lawrence's story, along with years of work that he'd put into the project, to Sam Spiegel "over luncheon at Anabelle's, the chic club next door to Korda's offices at 144-146 Piccadilly. Spiegel bought the whole package: the book (Lawrence's own 'Revolt In the Desert'), the existing screenplay, all the preliminary sketches. (Over coffee, brandy and cigars, he also bought the film rights to 'The African Queen,' which prompted Korda, in a rare burst of poor judgment, to say, 'My dear Sam, an old man and old woman go down an African river in an old boat — you will go bankrupt.')"

Aetna and most employers that buy its coverage cushion the blow by setting a maximum on the patient's monthly share, said Walt Cherniak, an Aetna spokesman. Modest-income patients also may qualify for discounts from drug manufacturers.
It's getting easier and easier to be cynical nowadays, mainly because obsolescence, which used to come with a cushion, a grace period, a reasonable shelf life, is now pretty much instantaneous. "Been there, done that" has become the "Wow!" of the newly enlightened, and the idea of being truly dazzled anymore seems like a quaint, old-fashioned notion clung to by someone who's never been pre-empted by a 9-year-old toting an Xphone or a GamePod.

The songs: Newsom began as a Dylanesque, or Cohenesque, songwriter; like Dylan or Cohen, she’d come up with a nice melodic phrase and keep repeating it for as long as she had things left to say about whatever she was on about. “This Side Of The Blue,“ one of the best songs on “Mender,” is an instructive example: it does the same thing, over and over, until she completes her observations. Then she puts a bow on it with a nifty final verse, she stops plucking for a few seconds, and fires up the next one. Lots of lyrics-first songwriters have used this technique; it works well for folksingers who want the repetition of metric patterns to do the rhythmic work that, in rock, is traditionally handled by the drummer. Phil Ochs was addicted to it. Joanna Newsom, however, has musical gifts that exceed those of Dylan, Cohen, and Phil Ochs (yes she does), and she soon began bumping up against the limitations of the strategy. Rather than edit herself, she experimented with multi-section songs, casting aside verse-chorus formalism in favor of something freer. On “Ys,” she sped up and slowed down, wrote prefaces and codas (“Monkey And Bear” had one of each), allowed melodic patterns to twist into releases, descants, bridges to nowhere, repeated bits, sudden irruptions, false endings and false starts. It wasn’t pastiche, and it wasn’t postmodern; it was a classical student with piles of delicate-hand journals, opinionated and courageous, in firm control of her own voluminous writing, unwilling to prune it back for the sake of the radio, or her fans, or her friends in Nevada City, or her frenemies in the music press. Its centerpiece was an undertaking -- the seventeen-minute “Only Skin,” which stretched into endless mist like the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and which, in a post-release interview, Newsom insisted was impossible to abbreviate. Can‘t call her wrong: she had thematic mileage to cover, and she was going to cover it, pop, rock, and “freak folk” expectations be damned. Nothing on “Have One On Me” is as daunting as “Only Skin,” which isn’t to imply that Newsom has wimped out. On the contrary: she’s preserved the harmonic and formal complexity of “Ys,” and hammered it into a somewhat more disciplined shape. Most of the songs have recognizable releases, even if they’re just tag lines that Newsom sings a few times in a row. The trajectories of these songs -- even the multi-part mind-scramblers like “Kingfisher” -- make logical sense; maybe not immediately, but give yourself two or three listens and you‘ll grok what she‘s doing in each one. Sometimes she starts out frantic and lets the waves ebb away to a calm tide; other times, like on “Ribbon Bows,“ she jumps between simple folk tunes and weirder sections that develop those melodies in illuminating directions. One song -- the pretty “On A Good Day,” which kicks off HOOM2 -- is even notable for its brevity. More representative is “In California,” which seeds its verse with eight majestic, unusual chord changes, dives into a near-gospel chorus, dallies in a gorgeous post-chorus that does that major-to-minor thing you might remember from your music theory class, cooks up another batch of verses, takes on the chorus from a slightly skewed angle, sets up the crazy cuckoo section I referred to earlier, and touches ground with a lengthy coda that nods to the other sections while developing a brand new melodic idea. I’m mixing metaphors; she does, too. She throws so much into these compositions that she’s bound to occasionally trip over her own eloquence. But unlike “Ys,” where Newsom built nothing but labyrinths, HOOM periodically revisits the Dylanesque style of “Mender”. “Does Not Suffice,” which closes the collection, yanks out the chorus of “In California” and treats it as a succinct, repetitive melodic idea, just like “This Side Of The Blue.” Sure, you could call it minutes ten through sixteen of “In California”. Newsom admits as much in the liner notes, where “Does Not Suffice” is referred to as a reprise. Or you could call it a return to winsome folk-pop from a singer who has largely abandoned the style. She’s a slippery character, this Newsom; she’ll have it both ways if you let her.

So in deference to our opinion that we do not outgrow fashion, we matched three local women older than 60 with three stylists to see what would develop.
