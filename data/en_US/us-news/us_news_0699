WEBER RETURNING HOME?
Romney hasn’t said how he would calculate the formula for annual raises in the premium-support amount — a pivotal consideration — yet he has recognized the need to shift from open-ended entitlements to fixed government contributions, a key element in any program to contain Washington’s spending explosion.
Am I exaggerating? Of course, lovey. It's one of the entitlements of age. Helps us to stay myopic and mirthful, which comes in really handy when we spot those plastic surgeons' ads in local magazines that promise to give us designer faces to match our stiletto heels. Why make fools of ourselves when we can pay high-priced doctors to do it for us?

Trueman points out there are methods of manipulating sound inherent in the design of the computers themselves. “The laptops have a sensor built in to protect the hard drive,” he says. “But it actually senses the tilt of the laptop, and you can use that, and have that control sound directly, as well.”
"Testosterone and estrogen are closely related," he says. "When you have hormones circulating at high levels, as at puberty, you can get breast development. And when puberty settles down, it usually goes away.

Devault faces the death penalty in her husband's death. She's scheduled to stand trial in superior court Aug. 11.
My wonderful husband will not stoop down to pick up a penny (it's hard on his back), but we who grew up during the Depression know that pennies become nickels, then dimes, then quarters and finally dollars. Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone — or crazy!
At the time, a tabloid was publishing an article about the affair, and Palmieri said the campaign was absorbed with keeping the story from crossing over into the mainstream media.

But Parker susses out that the handsome guy there to meet Peggy can't be on the level. Why would a suave gent in a tux be interested in cats? Cat-lovers of the world, feel free to get your kibble in a snit about this conclusion, but Parker's instincts are right. She calls Hardison, who interrupts poker to do some facial recognition magic -- Cat Boy is really a bigtime thief.

Novick says that after retirement, Molly will have three policies worth $450,000 of life insurance coverage, which should be enough.
I also found that this is a textbook, business-school case of organizational structure driving dysfunctional conduct. In our business, it's pretty much standard lore that if you own a combination company - electric and gas - you do not try to combine them at the operating level. The electric business tends to be a much larger business. So if you're a really smart, up-and-coming employee, what part of the business do you want to go to? If you're a manager, and you have $100 million in capital to allocate between your two businesses, where does that capital go?
Officially known as behavior detection officers, or BDOs, the screeners were supposed to focus on nervous, erratic or evasive gestures or speech and other indicators to single out passengers for extra scrutiny, but instead they concentrated on whether Mexican or Dominican passengers had proper visas or passport stamps, the report said — all at the direction of their managers.

Nowadays it's a different matter, he said. "If I worked in a stationary workplace and I had a normal schedule, I could take public transportation there and back." The problem is that he must travel throughout his far-flung district, which covers much of northern Los Angeles County. Antonovich added that he gets input from staffers who ride Metrolink and other transit services.

The Vanguard Group Inc. offers some of the best all-in-one funds around. The Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX or VWIAX) gets Morningstar's highest five-star ranking. It invests 40 percent of its assets in stocks and the rest in bonds. That stock proportion might be too high for some seniors Johns' age. But the fund's managers have proved adept in downturns. It lost only 10 percent in 2008, yet has returned 6.7 percent a year over the past decade.

Use a special brining bag (see What's New) or double-bag two heavy-duty, unscented trash bags and put them in an ice chest that is large enough to hold the turkey. Place turkey in bags, pour in brine and remaining 1 1/2 gallons water - there should be enough liquid to completely cover the bird. Press out air in bags; tightly close each bag separately. Keep turkey cold with bags of ice, which will also help keep it submerged in the brine. Brine for 12-24 hours.

But if Democrats get enough petition signatures to place the issue on the ballot, assuming SB 5 becomes law, the statute could not be implemented until Ohioans have a chance to vote on it. That would make it difficult for the governor to plan a budget with SB 5 included.
In fact, Yum's decor is so fantastic that it's almost a surprise that the menu is so traditional. It's comprehensive, to be sure, and covers all the typical Chinese-American and Japanese bases, with a few additional Asian dishes thrown in (like Pad Thai). But it doesn't venture out into any new territory.
The rate is lower than the 66 percent from the fourth quarter and the 66.4 percent from the first quarter of last year, according to the Census Bureau. The rate hit a high of 69.2 percent in 2004, before the housing bubble burst.

You are a Mets fan. You wear your old-school cap (the one with the blue button on the top, not orange) even though you know the moment people see you they will ask, “Why do you do this to yourself?” And if you are less than a committed Mets fan -- and there aren’t many these days (the fence sitters are mostly with the Yankees or with the MLB TV package darlings-of-the-week) -- then you shrug your shoulders and don’t say anything, or you join right along and bash for bashing’s sake.

The quarterbacks will be the No. 1 and No. 2 picks in the NFL draft on Thursday night, with Luck going first to the Indianapolis Colts, then Griffin -- the Heisman Trophy winner from Baylor -- set to be picked by the Washington Redskins. So again, as they have plenty of times in recent months, Luck and Griffin will share the spotlight.
Project Bugsplat is the name of every war, at least from the planners' point of view. A winnable war is waged from above, invisibly, with godlike impunity. Such wars, especially in today's political order, cannot be effectively opposed with acts of equally brutal counterforce; they can only be prolonged.

In that first act, Nottage, director Jo Bonney and the fired-up cast summon the velocity and snap of a classic 1930s screwball comedy. It feels unfair to single any actor out, though Block, Hébert-Gregory and, as a pseudo-Brazilian bombshell, Karen Olivo ("West Side Story") display particularly lethal timing.

In this one sense, it would make sense to give a screened number of immigrants pathways to citizenship, fine them and put them on tax rolls so they will defray some of the costs of benefits they receive. Our getting a half a loaf is better than getting no loaf.
City police do not suspect foul play in the girl’s disappearance but have enlisted help from the FBI, the Essex County Sheriff’s Department and the Prosecutor’s Office.
Photo IDs would make both voters and poll workers accountable for their actions. They'd discourage those who aren't eligible to vote, such as illegal aliens and those abuse their voting rights by voting more than once, voting in the names of dead people, and using addresses that house nothing more than a vacant lot.
The state Attorney General’s Office has not released its more comprehensive crime report for 2010, or provided numbers for the first six months of 2011. The FBI report did not include all of the 566 municipalities in New Jersey.

Like many of the Pollocks in the show, "Bald Woman" is densely composed and difficult to read. Only close scrutiny can unpack the contorted anatomy of the drooping woman and the many images derived from Orozco's mural—winding serpents, orange flames and the jumble of tiny, sickly green skulls surrounding the central figure. Pollock had transmuted Orozco's politically charged imagery into psychological totems. The morbid scene is redolent with death and despair.
NEW YORK -- Stocks surged to their highest level in five months Tuesday after a measure of the most important driver of the U.S. economy surged ahead in September, a hopeful sign for the country's main source of employment.
The incident occurred around 2:45 p.m. as the restaurant was open. Diners sat about ten feet away from the damaged area, although no one was injured, Pullano said.
Earlier this month, the administration revised rules that would govern the operation of VLTs. The Ohio Lottery Commission signed off on the changes that include lowering from 50 percent to 33 percent the tax rate race tracks would pay the state on VLT revenue; eliminating the requirement that 50 percent of the construction of the VLT facilities go to Ohio companies; eliminating a requirement that some construction work be set aside for minority businesses; and shifting the cost of owning or leasing the machines from the state to the race tracks.
Voter-approved initiatives can be amended in the Legislature two years after they pass a public vote, giving lawmakers the opportunity to put I-1053 on the chopping block. Eyman is certain that would happen if he doesn't renew the initiative.
The $5.8 million project will see the addition of 6,000 square feet of production space, and is expected to boost Momentive’s production capacity of boron nitride powder by 50 percent. Ten manufacturing jobs are expected to be added at the plant when the expansion is completed in December.
The Tuesday vote was on whether to move the legislation to the Senate floor for debate. With the recent desertions and a statement Thursday by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell that it is too early to consider the bill, it appeared supporters lacked the 60 votes needed to advance the measure.
Nor is it certain it will help Iraq solve its domestic problems. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki could be brought down with the loss of a few seats in the National Assembly. Angered by Maliki’s “authoritarianism,” some Sunni leaders are playing the autonomy card to weaken the central government. The Kurds, secure in their three autonomous provinces, are trying to butter their bread on both sides.

The next day, McQueary told Paterno what he allegedly saw, and the coach notified athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz, who in turn notified Spanier. Both men, as well as Paterno, testified they were told Sandusky behaved inappropriately in that 2002 incident, but not to the extent of McQueary’s graphic account to a state grand jury.
To regain its stride, RIM is essentially starting from scratch. Few of the apps available for its existing smartphones will work on the new platform, and the legacy BlackBerry won't be able to run apps created for the new platform.

Rivera also attempted to evade paying taxes on the income derived from the scheme. For the 2007 tax year he filed an individual tax return that claimed taxable income of $89,696 when he knew his total taxable income was $499,176, upon which he owed $149, 677 in federal income taxes, according to Fishman.
“Overall, RIM remains under a challenging transition period,” Barclays Capital analyst Jeff Kvaal wrote in a note to investors Friday, calling demand in North America "mediocre at best."
For decades, Minnesotans have spent their summer vacations in cabins and resorts in Cass and Crow Wing counties, located about 150 miles north of the Twin Cities. With more than 900 lakes, those two counties accounted for most of the $2.2 billion in spending and 6.8 million overnight visits in north-central and western Minnesota from June 2007 to May 2008, according to a recent report conducted for state tourism officials.
The first step is preparing the curd. I started with a mixture of whole milk, heavy cream and a little yogurt. After heating it, I added the rennet and let it sit again. Then I broke it up into curds, first cutting it with a knife, then (after letting it sit yet again), whisking it gently. By the end, I had curds that were about 1/8-inch big (the book said they should have been 1/4 inch — whatever).
Savings from the Medicare cuts will be invested in government IOUs, like any other trust fund surplus. The special Treasury securities count as an asset on Medicare's books -- making the program's precarious financial situation seem more reassuring. But the government will spend the actual money. And when time comes for Medicare to redeem the IOUs, lawmakers will have to scramble to come up with the cash.
øManufacturing has also been a big source of hiring. Factories account for only about 9 % of total payrolls but added 13% of new jobs last year. Manufacturers have added 120,000 jobs in the past three months, about one-fifth of all net gains.
In a lengthy report Wednesday, Goldman Sachs strongly recommended stocks over bonds in the next few years. The main reason: Valuations have fallen so sharply after years of poor performance that equities could register big gains if the economy keeps recovering.
"There are a lot of reasons it's a good time," said Rep. Tobias Read, D-Beaverton, vice chair of the House Transportation and Economic Development Committee. "It would be good for the economy, interest rates are low and it would help us maintain our place in line (for federal money.)"

Charisse Williams saw the playground at Detroit's only residential domestic violence shelter as her place of peace from a violent relationship last year.
The DIA is seeking the millage to cope with debilitating annual operating gaps of roughly $10 million-$12 million. Despite raising hundreds of millions dollars during the last decade, the museum has never been able to adequately replace state funding, which amounted to 70% of its budget until cuts began in the early 1990s. Where the DIA once received $16 million in annual state funding, it received zero this year, while also facing the impact of the recession and increasing fatigue among its donors.
So when manager Jim Leyland phoned the bullpen halfway through Sunday's game and called on Putkonen to keep the one-run game close, the rookie reliever focused on his job, and nothing more.
In coming weeks, the PDC hopes to have more details of financing options for the project. Donations from foundations and grants from federal economic stimulus and energy-efficiency programs could lower the cost. Donated materials from local companies also could drive down costs.
Despite two of opera's biggest cultural changes within our lifetimes -- the addition of supertitles in 1983 and the Met's HD broadcasts beginning in 2006 -- the reason more people don't "get" opera is not that it's not good enough. It's that it's not relevant enough. It's an acquired taste. They don't teach it in school. It's too expensive.
"I knew it was a do-or-die situation so I just went for it," Gonzales said. "One I crossed I was in total shock because I knew we were going to win."
Positively Cleveland has lots more ideas and a five-year plan to get things humming. It's worth watching.

Mrs. Winstead laughed when people misinterpreted her car's tag as "Love Tonight," said her son.
Federal law requires the court's approval and three appraisals before the house can be sold, Norgard said. The Cooks bought the home in 2005, paying $155,900 in cash and a $420,000 mortgage in Gina Cook's name. Records show that all but one of the mortgage payments came from accounts subject to the receivership, however.

That would be followed by creation of the new congressional committee that would have until the end of November to recommend $1.8 trillion or more in deficit cuts, targeting benefit programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, or overhauling the tax code. Those deficit cuts would allow a second increase in the debt limit.

chancellor at Missouri University of Science and Technology. Wray is the current provost of the school, which will lose its chancellor, John Carney, to retirement at month's end. Carney has been chancellor for six years. Wray, who joined the school in 2006, will take the interim position on Sept. 1 while the University of Missouri system continues its national search for a permanent replacement. Officials have said they do not expect the MS&T position to be filled until the four-campus system replaces its president - Gary Forsee - who left earlier this year to spend time with his ill wife.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — This time, the fourth quarter belonged to the Memphis Grizzlies.
Minneapolis City Attorney Susan Segal argued the stadium plan did not trigger the charter referendum requirement because the state is merely reclaiming its own money. The bill goes further and thwarts potential court challenges by nullifying that section of the city charter.

One of California's best destinations for adventures - kayaking, hiking, wildlife watching and fishing - remains off the radar for many from the Bay Area, Sacramento and Los Angeles.
"Jer-sey!" Danielle Staub hoots at her younger daughter Jillian, whose straight blonde strands have been curled and teased and sprayed into the quintessential Garden State 'do. Which is to say, big. Staub and her two daughters spent Monday afternoon at Salon Luba at the Shops at Riverside, the upscale Bergen County mall, while her three of her fellow housewives and their daughters got primped and pampered that morning.

Years ago I tasted dozens of sauvignon blancs for a series of wine lessons, and came up with this range of flavors: ripe pineapple, apricot, peach, melon, fig, kiwi, fresh-cut lawn, lemon grass, grapefruit, lime, gooseberry, celery, oregano, pencil lead, gunflint and, finally, cat pee. Yes, sauvignon blanc grapes grown in the coldest parts of the Loire definitely have something feral about them - in the good sense, I always hasten to add.

Last month, GM said it would end the franchises of 1,100 Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac dealerships nationwide. The company said another 500 dealers selling Saab, Saturn, Pontiac and Hummer vehicles also would be eliminated because GM wants to sell or scrap those brands. That means GM now plans to close another 400 or so dealerships.

Allan Owen, like McCoy, hit a choked-down driver off the tee. His soft fade found the middle of the green  30 feet from the front-right pin location and 30 feet from the OB fence (that should tell you something about the hole's small margin for error). He made a par.
Every fall, Canadian birding prognosticator Ron Pittaway of the Ontario Field Ornitholigists prepares his annual Winter Finch Forecast, a much-anticipated report of what birds from the boreal forest are likely to invade the United States.
"The folks from 2006 looked at the 1997 example and didn't want to repeat that history,'' he said.
There's a good reason for that: unlike O'Leary, Spurrier and Bowden were not running the drills in which their players died. In fact, they weren't even present at those fatal workouts. It might sound strange, but an argument could be made that O'Leary is in this massive public-relations predicament because he is a more involved, hands-on coach than both Spurrier and Bowden.
Arianna Norris-Landry, who has served as legal counsel for Occupy St. Louis, said the confrontation between the protesters and police was sudden.
Within days of winning one-fourth of the $330 million prize, in September 2007, he told news outlets in the U.S., Britain, Finland and Russia that his win had been preceded by a Tarot card reading that told him to slow down and focus on his spirituality.
But that's only if the charter school succeeds. (Many don't.) And also, the time when the city will be losing money (now) seems awfully inopportune, because the city is currently so cash-strapped that it's cutting city services and furloughing workers.
Century head coach Kyle Bunting argued to no avail with the umpires that Wullger left third base before Sam Bates caught Poyer's fly ball in center field.
Under the plan, the Rams would fund about 52 percent of the improvements. Ratcliffe said that figure wasn't picked at random - it is the average contribution by NFL teams in recent new stadium construction and renovation projects.

For the guest artists who appear on stage with Opera Colorado, that's not always easy. The altitude here can take even the most experienced singer by surprise. The sharp turns necessary for a challenging piece — like this week's production of "Il Trovatore" — can be even more challenging.
"At one of the group's meetings, the speaker was Bishop (George J.) Lucas, who was the bishop of Springfield," she said. "It was the first time that a Catholic bishop spoke in an Alton Protestant church."
Some earlier musicians had universal appeal. Chuck Berry, for instance. You get all kinds of people at his concerts. He was not only a much more important figure than Russell, but he was big in the '50s and '60s.
So my tendency to pick chardonnay with crab continues. Still, I wanted to get a few other opinions. One person I called was John Hulihan, who oversees the wine program for the Lark Creek Restaurant Group, which includes Yankee Pier in San Jose, Parcel 104 in Santa Clara and Lark Creek in Walnut Creek. The group has a special Dungeness crab promotion every February, and Hulihan says the restaurants highlight "wines we feel have a nice affinity with crab."
Kelley, a former county employee who was the middleman in many of the schemes, pleaded guilty in the probe and is now cooperating with investigators. He is still likely to serve six years in prison, however.

"Bully" has received weeks of publicity leading up to its release, partly because of controversy about its initial R rating, which would have prevented kids, the film's target audience, from seeing it.

Four years ago, Lightford awarded a waiver to the wife of a lobbyist, outraging critics.
Of course, you wouldn't want to try something like this without a wicked hangover. To that end, on the eve of the race, the El Rio nightclub in the Mission holds a party.

Gutierrez has missed the past 10 Cactus League games, and has just 24 at-bats this spring.
Contemporary societies widely accept and accommodate gay and lesbian relationships. Laws within the United States have changed to recognize same-sex civil unions and grant legal rights regarding health care facility visitation, tax rights and health care decision-making. In lieu of attacking advocates of traditional marriage, I urge same-sex couples to embrace the term "civil union." Perhaps this matter can be resolved by enacting a law that declares couples in same-sex civil unions have the appropriate rights and protections granted to those in traditional marriages.

Some crop yields didn't suffer much by following organic practices, the study found. Organic fruits such as strawberries and apples saw just a 3% difference, and oilseed crops followed just 11% behind their conventionally grown counterparts. Yields for organic cereals, however, were 26% lower, and organic vegetables lagged behind by 33%.

But the low inventory has spurred some new home building in the region, and housing starts in southeast Michigan were up 47% to 741 in the first quarter, according to Housing Consultants of Clarkston. That's the most activity in five years, but just a fraction of the pre-recession levels.

Instead of the usual "white-out," Penn State fans had a "blue-out" by wearing blue clothing, which represents support for stopping child abuse. It was announced that about $22,000 was raised for the cause.

Marijuana probably provides less than 25 percent of the cartels’ revenues. Legalizing it would take perhaps $10 billion from some bad and violent people, but the cartels would still make much more money from cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines.
Beane’s giving out second chances, true, but he’s only interested in the team, not its players. (When one man does stammer out a thank you, an even-more-embarrassed Beane brushes him off.)

This romantic drama is the edgiest-ever film adaptation of the writings of Nicholas Sparks -- which isn't saying much. Beth (Taylor Schilling) is a willowy and gorgeous single mom running a kennel with her speaks-her-mind grandma (Blythe Danner). Logan (Zac Efron) is a brooding but chivalrous ex-soldier who tracks her down after finding a photo of her on a battlefield in Iraq. He charms her, but she's slow to warm to him even as she's ogling the backside of his work jeans. Director Scott Hicks lifts this material above previous Sparks-inspired movies ("Dear John," "The Last Song") by holding his revelations in reserve and producing a scene or two of real sexual heat. But at every turn, Sparks hurls obvious melodramatic obstacles in the way, telegraphs his story's every move and underlines every emotion. Rated PG-13; sexuality, violence. 1 hour, 41 minutes. By Roger Moore, McClatchy-Tribune News Service.

That brings us to the fact that Bennett has actually won a Pac-12 start. He helped the Ducks win other games against Arizona State and Washington State. He looked good doing so, as well.

In case you've not been in personal proximity to Reverend Jackson, I think it might be interesting to note he's a very formidable figure, well over six feet tall, slightly graying now and has gained a couple pounds since our most recent in-person visit a few years ago, but not grotesquely nor pejoratively so.

As much as Rachel misses potatoes, she and her parents made sure she would not be deprived of something more nourishing: the family time they all crave. Some young athletes move to training centers far away from their homes to chase the Olympic dream. Jan Bootsma emphatically said that was never an option for her daughters, because the Aquajets offer top-notch coaching and facilities, and especially because Rachel cherishes their nightly dinners together and their evenings spent relaxing at home.
"When you love, you love. I mean, do you stop loving somebody because you have different images? You know, Bobby and I basically come from the same place," she told Rolling Stone in 1993. "You see somebody, and you deal with their image, that's their image. It's part of them, it's not the whole picture. I am not always in a sequined gown. I am nobody's angel. I can get down and dirty. I can get raunchy."

For me and doubtless many more decorated veterans of the spanner, MG's reboot as an upscale imprint of some dull Chinese car company, well, it's hard. And yet I marvel that in 2012, 8,000 miles and a couple of world orders away from the old Morris Garages, there is still an MG, and Abingdon is still hallowed ground.

I’ve said forever that a player should earn All-Star recognition not on his career body of work, but for his play in the first half of that season. There’s no guarantee Aldridge, 25, will ever put together a string of games as he has the past two months, when he has averaged 25.4 points and 10.2 rebounds on .524 shooting. The last Blazer to have that kind of extended success is probably Clyde Drexler, though Brandon Roy may have come close.

"The poor people that will benefit from public housing are being pushed out," said Eades. "If you go in Annapolis Gardens, it's predominantly Hispanic, and it used to be predominantly African-American.

Minor-leaguer Adam Melker, wearing No. 97 with no name on his back, pinch-hit for Lohse in the bottom of the sixth inning. He drilled a pitch toward the wall in right field. Had the wind been blowing in a different direction, the ball might have soared over the fence. Instead it caromed off the wall for an RBI single.
In the same vein, I thought Clemons' attorney, Robert Costantinou, was awful. In his closing argument, he pointed out that the body of one of the sisters had not been recovered.

Newt Gingrich, who as recently as last month held a 20-point lead here, initially seemed to understand that job. His closing Iowa argument was that voters faced a choice between a "Massachusetts moderate" and a candidate born to a "bold Reagan conservatism" that highlighted economic growth and opportunity.

In Libya, illegal migration is once again picking up, conducted through two primary trafficking corridors in the east and west of the country.

In Cabreras case, fighting the war is a no-brainer. Hes the best player on the team and one of the best in all of baseball. Young is a little more of a test case. Hes not a vital player based on his stats, but his spot in this lineup is crucial. If the Tigers offense is going to click the way we expect it to, Young needs to be in the order every day protecting Cabrera and Fielder and playing the way he did last season when the Tigers acquired him. Its an ugly, nasty bottom line business, but if Young is cleared to play, he should play -- because he can hit. That may strike some of as horrible, but we know it to be the truth. Sports doesnt discriminate, nor should it. It doesnt discriminate against good people or bad people. It doesnt discriminate against like-minded individuals or people whose views make your blood boil.

Champagne, in northern France, is one of the coolest wine-producing regions in the world. It has severely cold winters and rainy autumns, conditions that maintain acidity in grapes but sometimes don't fully ripen them. The resultant wines often offer elegance rather than forward fruit. Champagne's chalky soil is also critical, providing wet stone and mineral qualities to the wine.
As to the contract itself – it's exactly the type of deal the Cardinals could not and should not have matched. Too many years for too much money. When (not if) Albert's production dips to the point that he becomes a burden because of his contract, the Angels can just reach deeper into their pockets and buy more players to remain competitive. The Cardinals wouldn't have been able to do that. They could have kept Albert only by putting his interests ahead of the interests of the overall franchise – and that would have been stupid.
