The large, oversized mirrors and central sink create a very unique, well designed environment, too. - David Salisbury, a law firm's director of business development, avid diner

When the lawmakers who decided to prohibit ferrets in New York City and California made the laws for whatever reason, they chose to not follow the scientific definition of what a domesticated animal is.

Cabo Pulmo, a remote knob of classic Baja landscape with an underwater world singularly blessed by nature, slumbered for decades on the peninsula's East Cape. It rarely made a blip on the tourism radar except for avid fishermen, divers, and in more recent years, windsurfers and adventurous tourists from Los Cabos, about an hour's drive away. Despite a valiant, and successful, effort by Cabo Pulmo's residents and fans to get the federal government to protect its uniquely rich waters as a marine national park in 1995, today it is the target of massive development that would plant 30,000 hotel rooms — equivalent to another Cancun — on the sand dunes, along with a marina for 490 boats, shopping centers and two golf courses.

The islanders already were suffering: Inter-tribal warfare had taken its toll, the island was almost completely deforested and many moai had been toppled. When Capt. James Cook visited in 1774, he described the locals as "small, lean, timid and miserable." By the late 1800s, all moai had been toppled; the ones that greet visitors today have all been reerected.

In 1996, he noted that a chance seedling tree growing close to his Grenada orchard bore fruits that were deeply colored, large and juicy and had arils with soft seeds that made them easier to chew than those from other dark-fruited varieties. Together, these characteristics made it better than any pomegranate available commercially in September.

"Shaq is the most versatile guy I've seen," Elk Grove coach Chris Nixon said. "Last year he showed how devastating he can be to an offense as a DB. This year, he's shown that if you put him at QB, he instantly makes an offense a threat to score on any down. He was way faster and bigger than any defensive player we had. He could make three or four of them miss him on any given play."

As a result, Jonah hits bottom. His choice to flee sends him to the depths of the sea. Overwhelmed by fear and frustration, he lands in the belly of a great fish. Whether or not this actually happened is beside the point, in my opinion. The story is inviting me to look at the moments I have hit bottom. When life seemed so incomprehensible, there was nothing else for Jonah to do but to pray. Jonah laments, crying out: "As my life was ebbing away, I remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to you into your holy temple."

The phrase "cradle to grave welfare state" originated with Clement Atlee's socialist government in post-World War II Britain. Back then, it was meant as a boastful description of a new age of government activism. Subsequently, it became a term of derision for critics of an overweening government. In the spirit of Atlee, the Obama campaign revives the concept of "cradle to grave" as it highlights Obama-supported programs that take care of Julia from age 3 to her retirement at age 67.

Chuck Klosterman, ESPN.com: "Calipari has professionalized college sports, which is great for him and good for his recruits. It's just discomforting for anyone who likes NCAA basketball, assuming they're drawn to the same game that lives within their memory. He's built awesome teams for seven consecutive seasons, usually by overhauling his entire roster with transitory superstars who are only attending college because there's no reasonable alternative. He's completely up-front about this strategy, and it's irrefutably effective. In his three years at Kentucky, he's never lost a home game. But here's the rub: Every season, something goes wrong at the end - and that validates his critics . . . It's like there's this indefinable weakness to his system that everyone hopes will eventually emerge; somehow, we want to believe that the way Calipari conducts business is intangibly doomed (because that reinforces the traditional view of what team sports are supposed to represent). It's not unlike the way most NBA observers are predisposed to root against the Miami Heat: You should not be able to succeed in this way. You should not be able to arbitrarily construct a Super Team that automatically achieves Super Greatness. It cheapens the experience. It feels cold and uncreative. That's why traditionalists are always relieved when Calipari's template collapses: It suggests there's some inherent flaw to his philosophy that even he cannot see. It balances the system. But not this time."

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine butter with 1 cup water, the salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring. Continue to cook until the butter has melted, about 3-4 minutes. Add flour all at once, and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon until a thick paste forms, and pulls away from the side of the pan, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and make a well in the center. Crack one egg into the well, and beat it into the hot mixture, either with the wooden spoon or an electric handheld mixer. Repeat with three more eggs. Stirring until the mixture looks like a sticky paste.
Scott-Heron always acknowledged this inspiration. Upon graduation from the Fieldston School in the Bronx, where he'd been schooled on scholarship, he chose to enroll at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, the same college that Hughes had attended. But Scott-Heron was also compelled by popular music. With composer Brian Jackson -- whose Rhodes electric piano and flute-driven arrangements still echo through contemporary soul -- Scott-Heron recorded a string of arresting mid-'70s sets on which he sang as often as he spoke. "Winter in America," their 1974 collaboration, was a plea for compassion and humanity released at the height of the Watergate scandal, and it remains a formidably intelligent document of that time. "Rivers of my Fathers," an eight-minute jazz-soul journey, evoked the pained spirit of Hughes' landmark "The Negro Speaks of Rivers." Another track, "The Bottle," explored the intersection between inner-city poverty, alcoholism, and the culture of incarceration. Funky and propulsive, "The Bottle" became a block party favorite and Billboard chart success.

Despite his sunny remarks, Huntsman’s path to the GOP nomination, already unlikely, grew dimmer with his finish on Tuesday.

And then there’s Florida, which has multiple expensive media markets and typically features an airwaves war that the candidate is unlikely to be able to afford. Huntsman’s fundraising has been weak, though a pro-Huntsman super PAC largely funded by Huntsman’s billionaire father has helped his candidacy.

General culture: Select planting areas that are protected from the heat of the afternoon sun to avoid fading of the flowers. Moist, well-drained soils are ideal. Go easy on the fertilizer to reduce cloning and lots of small, weedy stems. Once established, the plants need little if any fertilizer. In late winter or early spring, prune away any dead stems at ground level to keep the plants attractive. Prune immediately after flowering in the spring. This will encourage new growth and random flowering the rest of the season.

Cusack is a delight, manic one moment, overwhelmed by regret in the next, and as long as director James McTeigue keeps the movie in motion, it all works. Rated R; bloody violence, grisly images. 1 hour, 51 minutes. By Roger Moore.
