Chris Carpenter has 21 complete regular-season games in 194 starts as a Cardinal, or less than 11 percent. I bring this up for a reason, and it isn't to knock Carp. I think most of us would agree that when Carpenter is healthy he's tough-minded, physically strong, and takes an extreme competitive edge to the mound. If Gibby is the toughest and most tenacious pitcher in Cardinals' history, Carp wouldn't be far behind. (See: Game 5, 2011 NLDS at Philadelphia.) But Gibson pitched during a time when starters went nine. Carpenter pitches in a time when managers can't restrain themselves; they have to organize a daily parade of relievers. Sigh.

Tavenner said it is understandable how records from that 1995 night could have been inaccurate, recalling there was an ice storm and the event ran very late. Spalding was leading the B competition for most of the evening, and no one expected Bowling Brook to pull an upset.

Anthony's game fell apart late and featured some bad moments: He lost the ball with 6:25 to go and then with 5:48 left and Miami leading 89-77, he drove on James, the player he's been compared to for eight years since they joined the league together in the same draft. This was not Anthony's moment, though, and he quickly stepped out of bounds and gave the ball to Miami. Chris Bosh hit a 3-pointer from there. The game was never competitive again.

We should all enjoy Coach Burton while he lasts, as the great season The Viks are going to have next year will propel this excellent man to the next level up, probably as a Pac-12 head coach. That's just the way things work.

Meanwhile, we're cheering for a promising "new" Alzheimer's disease drug, too. It's the skin-cancer drug bexarotene, which in lab studies whisked away 75 percent of Alzheimer's-related protein fragments (called beta amyloid) in rats' brains in just three days. Since its safety (but not efficacy for this effect) in humans is already known, we think quick testing as an Alzheimer's treatment will be a research priority! But don't wait; start eating brain boosters now! Other new research shows that 76 percent of brain health is in your hands (just 24 percent is genetic). Here's how your brain hopes you're eating:

Bernanke had previously told lawmakers that the exemption for smaller banks might not work. The concern on the part of the small banks is that merchants might refuse to accept their cards because they carry a higher fee. Bernanke has said that problems in dealing with all the complexities of the new law may mean that the Fed is not able to complete the rule to implement the law by an April 21 deadline.
The big question is how big those checks will be. Analysts and workers all have their guesses, but Ford has declined to offer a range. The company uses a complex formula that only shares profits on vehicles made and sold in the United States.

The money comes amid a new landscape in campaign finance created when the Supreme Court, in a case known as Citizens United v.

LY: The first half of the book is Jersey City's architecture and the second half is its people. Since a city is both architecture and people, this was a simple but logical way to create a portrait. Oddly, we know of no other Jersey City book to date that specifically approaches the subject this way.
What stands out to me is that three of the eight players have never played a down in the NFL. Brown was the biggest bust, a second-round pick who couldn't get on the field. And he played a position, outside linebacker, where the Cardinals needed help desperately. The Cardinals released him after one season, and Brown bounced around the league for a couple of years. He couldn't get on the field for anyone else, either. The Lions released him last February.

Rather than putting food on a pedestal, Hamilton portrays cooking as a ritual that keeps her grounded  a craft rather than an art. It doesn't last, she said of a beautiful plate of food that is demolished by a diner in just a few bites, but people are going to look at Rodin's work for centuries.
Some legislators view the information technology grant as a back-door way for Nixon to develop health insurance exchanges. The exchanges are meant to be one-stop marketplaces, where consumers can compare health plans. But opponents view them as part of an overreaching federal role in health care.

In one case, after the mother of a teenage girl reported that her daughter had been raped, a detective didn't contact the family for four months – even though the mother reported the assault the day after it happened.

But by then any forensic evidence that could have connected the attacker to the assault had deteriorated.

How did he pull this off? By figuring out what he wanted and controlling the whole process until he got it. Very few buttons, like Mr. Jobs's clothing. But more importantly, don't just touch your computer, feel it. Let the graphics and icons simplify life's complexities. Let your fingers flow over the glass instead of peck at it. Speak to it.

The committee ultimately recommended a session on how pension costs could add up under five worst-case scenarios.

We started one of our visits with Soft Shell Crab Meuniere and Veal Bolognese Gnocchi appetizers. The ultra-crispy fried crab was paired with a zesty, lemony butter sauce. The rich veal dish featured light-as-a-feather gnocchi. I knew they were possible, because my wife makes gnocchi like this, but I have been consistently disappointed by the heavy, chewy globs most restaurants serve. Our feast included Long Bone Veal Chop Stuffed With Chevre and Melted Leeks and a pan-seared Kingklip. Appetizers and entrees were superb, if pricey. Yes, you'll pay top dollar here. If your idea of dinner out is a $20 meal for two, stay away. Far away. But if you don't mind putting down a few bucks for some of the best Northern Italian cuisine this side of Friuli, you owe it to yourself to experience this Cleveland gem. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer

A: I take, for example, what we'd do with the corporate taxes. Cut corporate tax rates in half and we make it, basically, a flat tax. That's a great advantage to small business. Why? Because small businesses don't have the compliance departments and auditors and accountants to be able to figure out how to maximize their -- look, I do my own taxes. Heck, Romney paid half the tax rate I did. Obviously he doesn't do his own taxes. Maybe I should hire an accountant in the future.

Jayson Stark, ESPN.com: "So Ryan Braun is an innocent man. Or is he? So the MVP's successful appeal proves he's clean. Or does it? So a man who has always proclaimed that his positive test was ‘baloney' (or a word that means something similar to baloney) can now resume his fabulous career and reclaim his golden-boy image. Or can he? It's amazing, isn't it, what we don't know, even in the wake of Thursday's stunning news that Braun's 50-game PED suspension had been overturned by baseball's long-time arbitrator, Shyam Das. This is a verdict that seems to tell us, if you just read the headlines, that Braun is as innocent as he has always claimed. It's a verdict that appears to suggest that the circumstances surrounding his positive test in October were as odd as his side has long contended they were. It's a ruling that theoretically proclaims that this was not a man who cheated his way to a most valuable player award, as his supporters desperately want to believe. But is that a proper reading of this decision, or isn't it? The sad part of this news is this: We may never know."

Do read: The Atlantic's Megan McArdle on Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, who's returning to the classroom at the University of Chicago. McArdle discloses up front that Goolsbee was one of her business school profs -- and a darned good one, in her recounting -- but her focus in on the self-effacing way he operated in a city where "Hey, Look at me!" is the dominant ethos. I especially like Goolsbee's own job description: "I always felt my role was like the pit crew in a NASCAR race and President Obama was Dale Jr. -- he's driving, and my job is to change the tires and get him back on the road."

Homer shows us both the human and the animal aspects of his ancient warriors. The driving desire for glory, for honor, and the passionate loyalty to comrades are certainly not bad traits but in war have led humans to commit horrific atrocities against each other. The tragedy as O'Hare and Peterson eloquently underscore is that brutal and brutalizing war is so deeply embedded in the human experience. The capacity for animal rage lies just beneath the surface of all so-called civilized behavior, and this fact is something we need to know.

You don't need a prescription for Jack's chicken soup, but you may find it's worth one. Not many restaurants offer a broth with such deep chicken flavor and a comforting, lightly thickened mouthfeel. Dress yours with a matzo ball, noodles, rice or kreplach -- or all four. Also plan on one of the best corned beef sandwiches in town, a stack both juicy and lean. Opened in 1980 by Alvie Markowitz; his brother, Harry; and father Jack, it is now run by Alvie in partnership with Gary Lebowitz. The wide, square dining room is corporately bland-looking, but it's the food and company that matter here. The menu is staggering, starting with a variety of breakfast items such as challah French toast, waffles and omelets. Soups, salads and sandwiches dominate the lunch hour, while dinner features specialties such as corned beef and cabbage, stuffed cabbage, beef brisket, roast turkey and chicken schnitzel. Cheesecake, brownies and ice cream highlight the dessert menu, as you might expect. (DS)

There's nothing wrong with not wanting kids, and your fear of having your life upended makes emotional sense. However, your argument doesn't. Either you can project enough joy in family life to accept that kids' needs are anything but convenient -- and, therefore, can say, "I do want children" without setting off any pandering-, wishful-thinking- or crap-meters -- or, you can't.
Regulators determined that the first spiking was essentially an effort to get around federal rules aimed at capping pressure on an urban pipeline at the highest point at which it had operated over a five-year period.
To GOP lawmakers, steps like blocking states from gaming food stamp eligibility rules to boost benefits or trying to stop illegal immigrants from claiming tax refunds of up to $1,000 per child are simply no-brainers.

Cityside Bistro opened earlier this year to grand expectations. It's a lovely modern little space, its bistro title a cheeky understatement to its urbane décor. The bar, the lighting, the artwork and even the silver on the table are modern and sophisticated. The wine list offers a number of really good choices. Plus, the restaurant proudly boasted a chef from the kitchen of the revered Manhattan celebrity hangout, the Spotted Pig -- a chef who learned at the kitchen of April Bloomfield, no less. It was an auspicious beginning.

In the margarita experimentation game, as long as you're using quality ingredients, you're winning. That means no margarita mixes. Variations can be as subtle as swapping one citrus out for another, choosing an aged tequila over a blanco or, as in Tommy's margarita from Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco, ditching triple sec in favor of agave syrup. On the more elaborate end of the spectrum, margaritas can be imbued with fruit purées, rimmed with chipotle-spiced salt or incorporate spirits outside of standard margarita territory, such as Campari or green Chartreuse.

Republicans shouldn't be frightened of Social Security so much as scared of their own empty rhetoric (including their disdain for how the trust fund surplus is used to pay for other government programs and isn't sitting in a vault somewhere).

In Minnesota, the court system rubber-stamps most debt claims without scrutinizing them for accuracy.

Like the Price family in City Heights, our foundation chose to focus its charitable work on a single community, believing that private philanthropy could successfully intervene in neighborhoods where both government and market forces had failed to appreciably move the needle. By engaging residents in transforming their communities, and putting dollars behind the ideas and initiatives of those same people, the Jacobs Family Foundation views charity as a catalyst, not a Band-Aid. The results speak for themselves, and stand separate from the redevelopment saga.
Democrats have called Christie's decision to eliminate New Jersey's entire contribution to the 58 family planning clinics insensitive to women, and economically foolish, noting it turns down $9 in federal funding for every $1 the state spends.

The occupation/employer requirement, sponsored by Sen. Bill Ferguson and Dels. Jon Cardin and Michael G. Summers, all Democrats, will make it much easier for voters and watchdog groups to discern whether a particular candidate is getting an undue amount of support from a particular business or industry — say, developers, gambling interests or the liquor lobby. It will also enable research into which industries have the most potential sway in Annapolis. That should help voters make more-informed decisions — and could go a long way in explaining why things happen the way they do in the State House.

If the Independent Police Review Division can initiate officer investigations, the union argued the inquiry must be done by police internal affairs.

So what's a target of these flying vampires to do? You Docs are fans of oil of lemon eucalyptus (or PMD, for para-menthane-3,8-diol, the synthesized version). It's registered with the Environmental Protection Agency, which means it is safe and effective. One application gives two hours protection, about as much as an insect repellant with a low concentration of the chemical DEET. Alpha-Keri and Skin-So-Soft also repel insects; these products are less effective, but easy on the skin. Another non-DEET choice is Bite Blocker: It's made with oils of geranium, soybean and coconut, and offers about an hour and a half of protection.
