But Prohibition was what put the roar in the Roaring '20s, soaking the era in wave after wave of bathtub gin, bootleg hootch and speakeasy booze. It allowed organized crime to get more organized, building mob empires on crates of illegal liquor.

The filling really could be any thick jam, or even a piece of dried fruit or a salted nut. But I liked quince paste, an extremely thick jam-like paste often sold near fine cheeses. It has a pleasantly tart-sweet flavor that works well with the marzipan and chocolate.
"They have so many talented kids over on the East side," Newgent said. "We knew coming in that every single line was going to have speed and three solid skaters that could get the puck in deep, bang and score goals."
If I sensed cautiousness, though, in that Fort Washington kitchen as it cooked with more conservative suburban palates in mind, all inhibitions have been dropped on the way to opening this Fairmount Avenue sibling, the sunny, sky-lit space and patio once occupied by Illuminare. Spinner and his crew challenge themselves with nightly specials, seasonal ingredients and current techniques — from pig ear terrines to sous-vide melon ceviche, house-ground chorizo and the essence of spring white asparagus — and La Calaca has helped push the dial forward a few more clicks on the evolution of contemporary Mexican cooking in this town. Perhaps more than Distrito, which has evolved little in the past couple years, and even served me stale chips at a recent lunch.

There's the distance and immediacy of the image, which motivates the title story, as well as the taut, unsettling "Baader-Meinhof," perhaps the best piece in the collection, built around the German painter Gerhard Richter's "October 18, 1977" sequence at New York's Museum of Modern Art. There's the necessary contrivance of narrative, which is both insufficient and our only solace, an idea that infuses both "The Starveling" and "Midnight in Dostoevsky." There's the influence of media and terror, those twin axes of modern power, which fuel "Hammer and Sickle," where, among other things, a wife sends increasingly radical messages to her incarcerated husband through the medium of television. It's as if in putting together "The Angel Esmeralda" DeLillo had decided to construct a primer, a guidebook to his literary life.

We're surrounded by the river on three sides. There are a couple of private lakes and a canal system, with bike paths and water-based wildlife. It's a good area for walking, bike riding and scenery.

Manager Kalen Kelekoma climbs atop a wooden crate and welcomes the throng with a warm "aloha" and an explanation of the market rules. Then the horn sounds, and they rush the stalls. Some head straight for the obvious draws on this hot day - ice-cold coconuts and soursop ice cream. Others start grabbing tropical fruits they rarely get a chance to taste on the mainland - rambutans, longans, lychees and mangosteens. Some buy salad greens and broccoli.

Quarterbacks used to sit for two, three, four years. I've been told by NFL folks that as players got bigger and stronger in college, and were coached better by better coaches, and started from the time they were freshmen, they were ready to go sooner in the pros -- and there were more teams, and they needed quarterbacks.

Where is Pipeline? From the grass area of the Ehukai Beach Park, Pipeline is down to your left about 100 yards. There are two surf breaks at the location. Pipeline is the left break that moves from left to right when seen from the shore. The right break that moves from right to left is called "Backdoor" or sometimes "Backdoor Pipeline." When the waves are very large, a second tube is created further out, called "Outside Pipeline."
This clash of paradigms came to a juncture in July 1937, when the British Peel Commission recommended the partition of Palestine into two separate states, leaving Jews about 20% of the land. The Arabs flatly rejected the partition plan, arguing that they should not be turned into a minority in any part of Palestine, however slender the margin. Had this plan been accepted, much of European Jewry could have been saved, and Israel would have become a thriving Hong Kong-type enclave, home to 10 million Jews and neighbor to an equally thriving Palestinian state four times its size.
The CIA used the enhanced interrogation techniques on high-level detainees at "black sites" or secret prisons outside the United States.
It's the threat of violence that has always made fiction about Los Angeles so fundamentally different than the raft of books about Manhattan: There always seems to be an undertone of menace. Perhaps it's a genetic marker left over from the great crime fiction that first rose out of Los Angeles, or perhaps it's that the citizens of Los Angeles have always understood that if reality can be manipulated, well, identity is nothing.
It was a much different scene on the plane ride home from San Francisco on Sunday, and Coughlin gladly recounted it, from the players wearing their NFC Championship gear, to the stewardesses as “cheerleaders decked out in Giants gear,” to the “really loud” volume level with some high-fives exchanged followed by more hushed tones as everyone “settled in and tried to get some sleep.”

"A fascinating discovery and a first in Maya archaeology," says Maya anthropologist Victoria Bricker of Tulane University in New Orleans.

It comes down to making pitches."

The space itself may have a bit more pizzazz, but Hajj’s diner still offers the same hearty breakfast and lunch plates that first captured the city’s attention 16 years ago, when it proved a major step up from Boston’s average greasy spoon. Mike’s pocket-- friendly menu is unique and perhaps even more appealing today than it was in 1996. It stands out amid the trendy, upscale chef-driven boutique restaurants that now largely define South End dining culture. Yet it still offers plenty of culinary street cred in a neighborhood of sophisticated foodies.

Ebanks survived his first test during Bryant's absence by mostly staying in his lane and not committing too many mistakes. He blossomed in the second half of the Lakers-Thunder game by making two late-game steals and holding Durant to five-of-19 shooting in the fourth quarter and subsequent overtimes.

And it was. Of course. The Rangers would go on to a 4-2 win over the Ottawa Senators, would seize a 1-0 lead in these best-of-seven Eastern Conference quarterfinals, would shake off the stubborn Senators and get four goals from four different men, one reliably stingy effort from Henrik Lundqvist, so what they did was take the formula that earned them the top seed in the conference and lug it into the playoffs.

This is the stuff that truly drives regular, hard-working taxpayers nuts."
... I introduced the Newspaper Revitalization Act to help our disappearing community and metropolitan papers by allowing them to become nonprofit organizations. My goal is to save local coverage by reporters who know their communities, work their beats and dig up the stories that are important to our daily lives. Today, newspapers do that job; all other outlets -- TV, radio, blogs -- feed off that base.

It might not be the latest-hottest-gotta-be-there address in town. But more than a decade after opening, the Blue Point remains one of the city's best restaurants. One of the first places to establish the Warehouse District as a food-and-drink destination, this lovely, airy seafood restaurant and bar is still more than worth the drive.

Then LaBonte found gazelle beetles proliferating beneath old-growth fir and hemlock trees near the top of Marys Peak west of Corvallis, the highest point in Oregon's Coast Range at more than 4,000 feet. The peak is typically snow covered from mid November until April. The beetles had colonized the forest, meadows and rocky summit; often it was the most abundant beetle. On previous trips there, LaBonte found only native species.

A transom door in the rear of the boat, which swings with open to become a swim deck, is fitted with so many hydraulics, locking pins, rotating stairs and electronics that it cost around $25 million to build. The company that made it eventually went bankrupt, along with the company that made the bomb-proof wrap-around glass encasing the master suite and the company that built the hydraulic gangways. The ship's two main landing boats are mini-yachts themselves, stretching to 36 feet, boasting plush interiors and costing more than $1 million each.
Damon Hack, SI.com: "For all of the Jets' bluster about 'ground and pound,' they averaged just 3.8 yards a carry last season (down from 4.4 yards in 2010). With new offensive coordinator Tony Sparano in the building, Tebow should give the Jets flexibility to use the Wildcat formation, which would play to Tebow's strengths as a runner. When the Jets went to back-to-back AFC Championship Games, Brad Smith was a wonderful weapon in their backfield. (He averaged 11.5 yards a carry in 2009 and 7.9 yards in 2010). Smith left the Jets for Buffalo last season, and he was missed. Tebow will help bring back some versatility to the Jets' running game."

From 1984, when he first ran for county recorder, through 2006, Russo never faced a truly competitive Democratic primary. Only once -- in 1998, when Mike Wise ran against him after he had been appointed auditor -- did he have a Republican opponent with enough skill and money to mount a serious challenge. But Wise got only 39 percent of the vote, even though Russo had been indicted for theft in office while recorder, for allowing his county employees to do political chores on public time. Russo pleaded guilty that time to a misdemeanor.

What ambitious Democratic politician would want to risk losing them by taking on Mr. Obama?

Since then, Sicilia has advocated for victims and for rethinking drug policies on both sides of the border.

Unlike United, Delta is so far not adding extra-legroom seats on its domestic fleet of A320s, 737s, and MD90s. My guess is that if Delta likes the market response to overseas flights, it will add economy comfort to its domestic planes as well. Meanwhile, Delta occasionally uses international planes for a few domestic flights; Delta may offer economy comfort an extra-cost option or those seats will go to some of the many more frequent flyers who are eligible for upgrades than available first-class seats.

And during that January 1979 stretch you described in Chicago, I was a salesman working the International Housewares Show at McCormick Place. Without question those were the most miserable 10 days I ever spent in Chicago, which happens to be my favorite city in the U.S. I didn't have my coat — those were the days when businessmen wore suits and ties. I sure could have used it.

Its location in the Cascades resembles the Bavarian alpine foothills, but the Oktoberfest there has gone downhill, attracting more or less a rowdy drinking audience and no longer includes German oompah bands like it did in past years. The surrounding setting, though, is beautiful, and there are some wonderful wineries up there."

Savings bonds are purchased at half their face value: A $100 bond costs $50 upfront (one reason for bonds' popularity as gifts), and delivers a fixed rate of return over a specified period of time -- essentially, you're loaning Uncle Sam money. Bonds accumulate interest until they mature and reach their full value, after which they earn interest for 10 more years. (To learn more about savings bonds, click here.) They're a more-thoughtful gift than handing a child cash or a check -- you have to plan ahead, instead of just reaching into your wallet. And because a child has to go down to the bank to cash the bond, the money is more likely to be saved.

From the American standpoint, the narrative of a U.S. military man leaving his isolated outpost and slaughtering defenseless men, women and children -- some too tiny to register what was happening, others waking in terror, only to be methodically stalked room to room -- represents a profound aberration from accepted norms, a betrayal of every value U.S. forces are sworn to uphold.
