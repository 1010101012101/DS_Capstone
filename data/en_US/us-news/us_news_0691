In response to public information act requests from The Sun and others, Mr. Teare has released a handful of files that fit that description.

Some former agents acknowledge a close-knit atmosphere where employees travel, dine and socialize together — sometimes in the form of so-called "wheels up" parties held in foreign countries after the departure of a president or other person under protection. But they say the prostitution scandal does not represent a cultural problem or reflect a broader disdain for women.

Offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride and his staff. There was tremendous design on a 24-yard run by Bradshaw early midway through the first quarter. It came out of a formation in which they had just run a pitch to the right side. The formation and the early movement after the snap indicated a run that way again but then -- bam! -- a quick counter to the left. Yes, I just unleashed my inner John Madden. And here comes a whap! because Kevin Boothe flattened CB Kyle Arrington on the kick-out block. Henry Hynoski cut pursuing LB Brandon Spikes and then Bradshaw blocked for himself with a stiff arm (a little grab of Chung’s face mask) that allowed him to gain the last 19 yards of a 24-yard gain. I can’t tell you for sure the Giants’ coaching staff saw something on film that told them a play to the right and then a counter back left would allow for something like that to happen against the Pats’ D, but I’d say it’s a good bet they did.
The Angels have always had the defensive mojo to keep themselves among the area's elite, but through the first two games this season they have notched eight goals. Five of those tallies came from five different players Wednesday afternoon in a 5-2 victory over a good Notre Dame squad at the Anheuser-Busch Center.
Michael Heeter, director of college counseling at Hawken School, suggests "Fiske Guide to Colleges" for a more subjective look. "It gets to the heart of the atmosphere and culture on campus," he says.
Top Picks Analysis: The Titans were believed to be leaning towards defense or the offensive line with their first-round pick, but the team switched gears by nabbing Wright, Robert Griffin's favorite target at Baylor. The former basketball player is an exceptionally quick and slippery receiver with impressive toughness as well, though a lack of preferred size and strength may limit him to the slot in the pros. Speed is also one of Brown's best assets, with the second-round choice setting a school record in the 60-meter dash while a member of the North Carolina track team, but suspect instincts and a passive demeanor in run support caused his stock to slip. Conversely, Martin competes with a relentless motor to go along with superior weight-room strength and solid quickness. He's similar to Titans' 2011 third-rounder Jurrell Casey, a 15-game starter as rookie, and will likely rotate with his new teammate this coming season.
Unlike the mechanical harvesters available a decade ago that used sticks to knock the fruit onto the conveyor belts and damaged the vines, these machines can be calibrated to gentler vibration levels.

Now, how offering congratulations translates into some form of subterfuge is beyond me.

All of which has left us with a winner-take-all system that was never voted on or designed as a matter of national policy and has numerous intrinsic defects (such as transforming presidential elections into nonevents in the many states where candidates don't bother to campaign because the outcome is not in doubt). We are also left with a constitutional framework that remains vulnerable to partisan machinations. That framework, created by men of the 18th century who could barely imagine mass political parties, permits the rules of the game to be changed in midstream by any one state or any collection of states. The largest states, of course, would be particularly inviting targets.
Commercial espresso makers use 22 to 26 grams (of ground coffee) per 2-ounce shot, while home espresso makers can only accommodate 12 to 16 grams per 2-ounce shot. What we were after was a blend that had a wide margin of error and performed well under pressure  pun intended, Helt says.

Europe-bound repositioning cruises -- one-way sailings that cruise lines sell at deep discounts when they relocate ships from, say, the Caribbean in the winter to Europe in the spring -- are particularly good bargains. Norwegian Epic's 11-night crossing from Miami to Barcelona on April 14, for example, starts at $699 for a balcony stateroom. That's less than the least expensive one-way flight -- $756 on Iberia with a stop in Düsseldorf, Germany -- found on Kayak.com in a recent search.

One major contribution that was singularly hers was her translation of Dali's writings, mostly in French and Spanish, for wider dissemination.

Worse, overemphasizing costs may make it harder for a restructured GM to focus on quality and innovation. Will a cost-obsessed management close so many plants and lay off so many engineers, designers and production workers that the company loses its ability to make better and more innovative cars? I hope not, but I can't be confident. Organizations that are good at cost-cutting usually aren't good at innovating or getting better at what they do. Navigating between the poles of cost-cutting and innovation may be the biggest obstacle on GM's road to recovery.

Ke$ha, never short on cartoonish personality, co-wrote "Till the World Ends," the lead-off track on "Femme Fatale" and a current Top 10 hit. On her 2009 hit "TiK ToK," she and her producers used AutoTune to augment the narrator’s giddiness. The unnatural, computer-generated melodic leaps in the chorus couldn’t have happened without the software, but they also couldn’t have happened without Ke$ha herself. Like Cher on "Believe," this was the pop star as cyborg — half giggling schoolyard seductress, half robot girlfriend.

It seems to me that perhaps people need to give this a little more thought before offering to give up these rights. We seem to forget that "the people" granted limited rights to the government, and that all others are reserved to us, as opposed some current thought that the government granted us these rights and therefore has the power to ignore them and take them away.
Ms. Steinbach was the author of three books: "The Miss Dennis School of Writing: And Other Lessons from a Woman's Life," "Without Reservations: The Travels of an Independent Woman" and "Educating Alice: Adventures of a Curious Woman."

Those with chronically high cortisol levels — or whose cortisol levels fail to float downward in the evening — not only feel stressed, they also are vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, both mental and physical. They even tend to die earlier, studies have shown. So linking cortisol levels with married parents’ end-of-day activities, the authors surmise, should tell us a lot about how our home lives influence our health and happiness.

The final challenge was to assemble a campsite. This wasn’t a pop-up tent and some sleeping bags. This was serious metal frames, tarps, cots, bedding, and a working camp shower. According to Army Dave and Army Wife, that frame was not easy to put together, since they took it apart a few times and shared nice words like “you’re so negative” and “I heard you the first five times.”

Among the homes just north of Broadway's commercial strip, survivors told stories of hearing sirens and barely having time to make it to the basement, if they could get there at all.

I go back to the now-infamous video of the policeman at UC Davis, acting not so much in personal disdain toward the students he was pepper-spraying as in a context of institutional disdain for them. The police defined their role as restoring order, but what they were doing was re-establishing turf. To that end, they were simply doing their jobs: removing impediments.

Many in Columbus, some who have never used the Ohio Turnpike, are now experts and think the Ohio Turnpike is simply a mini-ODOT. Turnpike revenue is collected through tolls (cash) at 31 locations, versus ODOT, which receives large payments from the Department of Taxation. The turnpike operates 16 service plazas, essentially mini-shopping centers. The turnpike has a credit rating separate from the state of Ohio. Additionally, the turnpike is a limited access highway where an accident can essentially trap vehicles on the roadway with no place to exit. This forces the turnpike to make provisions for emergency and towing services. McDonald's and a local buffet may both serve large amounts of hot food to many customers very quickly; they are, however, two distinctly different food-service concepts. Similarly, ODOT and the Ohio Turnpike are two distinctly different types of transportation systems.

If you lard your text with words from the languages other than English spoken in South Africa (the country has no fewer than 11 official languages!) and local references that convey the texture of South African conversation, shouldn't you build in explanations for those unfamiliar with these terms? Gordimer cannot always be bothered to do so and this leaves too many points hanging loosely.
On a recent Asian trip, my friend Don's airline changed his schedule without notifying him or asking if the substitute schedule was OK. As a matter of fact, the new schedule wasn't OK with Don. And being a cantankerous sort, he checked on alternate possibilities and called his airline to ask for a different new schedule. As it happened, the preferred new schedule involved one of his original line's partner lines, and Don had to push a little to get the switch made.

Upon his release he drags you into federal court claiming that you and the city violated his civil rights because you did not find his gun after the shooting. Although he is alleged to have admitted to a cellmate that he did in fact have a gun and threw it away during the pursuit, the federal judge does not allow the jury to hear that evidence. The judge does not allow the jury to hear evidence that the plaintiff is a violent gang member or that he was convicted and imprisoned for the very drive-by shooting that resulted in his injuries. After being denied so much critically important information, the jury finds that you violated the gang-banger's civil rights.

7. Apple TV (2007) -- Apple's foray into the living room was an uncharacteristically half-hearted effort -- Jobs later referred to the Apple TV as a "hobby." It was a small box that connected to a TV and to a Mac in the home. A tiny remote allowed the owner to play music and movies from the PC on the TV. It was expensive, at $249, and complicated to set up and use. Movies purchased from iTunes were low resolution and looked blurry on HDTV sets. In 2010, Apple introduced a much improved, cheaper Apple TV designed to connect directly to the Internet.

The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in certain cases, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized.

(By the way, is there such a thing as a "low-powered assault gun"?) As anyone familiar with firearms can tell you, a shotgun is a far more devastating weapon than any handgun that's been produced.
