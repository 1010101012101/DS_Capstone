Wyden is embracing premium support and, in the process, lending respectability to Ryan and the House Republicans. Ryan although distancing himself from his former proposal, still isn’t coming to terms with the Affordable Care Act. That’s been the story for a while now: Democrats are more willing to compromise than Republicans. Until that changes, Democrats make concessions at their own peril and with great risk for their constituents.

There was also Saint Peter’s trademark stingy defense. Between that and Seton Hall’s offensive woes early on, the Peacocks (1-4) were able to hang around all night long. There were shots that didn’t fall. Rebounds that weren’t pulled down. Passes that weren’t caught. All of that keeping the Peacocks’ hopes alive. Still, Saint Peter’s had opportunities of its own, but couldn’t capitalize.
Fongwei Liu is an extraordinary painter in the traditional figurative genre. He has earned a master of fine arts degree from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. His works stun the viewer and dominate the gallery with scale, color and brilliantly trapped subject matter. His oil painting titled "Before the Performance 2" (30" x 40") depicts a beautiful young dancer, in Middle Eastern-style dress, red pants and bare midriff, anticipating — in angst, prior to a performance. She is timeless and controls the canvas.

Two weeks ago she struck out a combined 22 batters and allowed just two runs in wins over Fontbonne Hall and Mary Louis.

Duncan's leave from the Cardinals fed concerns that a first-year manager may become overwhelmed without Tony La Russa's long-time lieutenant. The absence of Duncan's encyclopedic recall and records is obvious; however, the low-key Lilliquist espouses much the same emphasis - pitch efficiency and working down in the strike zone - while drawing from 10 years' experience in the organization.
It would be a shame for the Blues to go quietly, and submit weakly, in the remainder of this series. I want to see the Blues make an honest stand, and give everything they have, to extend this series and give themselves a chance. I don't want to lose respect for the Blues. I want to feel positive about the season. But if the Blues roll over in Los Angeles, they'll trash much of the respect and admiration they'd earned this season.

Jones was in the clear and going in for a fastbreak layup when the 235-pound Acy came up from behind, took a whack at the ball but mainly just crashed into the Kentucky player, sending him flying into the Baylor cheerleaders along the baseline.

øBeing Black Widow: To reprise her role as Black Widow, Johansson slips back into her leather jumpsuit as the only female superhero in the bunch. But, she conceded, a few rules were necessary - especially late at night. "You have to remind the guys at times that you're not a man," she said. "They will go full speed ahead and sometimes you have to be like, 'Guys you cannot drag me to one more place, I'm a girl, I'm getting my beauty sleep.' They can rage, for sure."
Neil Walker chopped a groundball to first baseman Albert Pujols. Pujols made a flip to the bag that Suppan didn't handle. The error was charged to the receiver not the thrower.

But, by design, the posted comments underneath these stories don't have that type of filter. For one thing, we don't want to curb conversation among readers. And as a practical matter, we can't monitor the comments under every story 24 hours a day. And as a legal matter, if we start hand-editing comments for content, we might be liable for any defamatory posts. So, we have an automatic filter for naughty words and we have a "Report Abuse" button that will under certain circumstances automatically remove posts readers find objectionable. We purposely don't say how it works because we don't want people to manipulate it for the wrong reasons. In short, we provide these boards; readers control them.

-- Kuroda's signing made it clear that managing general partner authorized a bump in payroll. But I'd be surprised if it was enough to work in another major signing. In the last three seasons, the team's payroll hasn't strayed far past $213 million, which has served as a ceiling of sorts. With the team trying to mind their finances, there's no reason to believe they'd stray past that barrier, which incidentally is also their all-time high.

There are risks involved with immunization. If a parent believes that the safest thing for their child is not to immunize them, they should not be forced to get a form signed by a physician before their child can attend school. Schools already have the authority to send an un-immunized child home if there is an outbreak, and the vast majority of children are already immunized. I have great respect for the author and sponsors of AB 2109, but this bill simply goes too far.
The key to a perfect blowout, Deavalon says, is sealing the cuticle using heat and the angle of air from the blow dryer.

ANALYSIS: Obama's ad evokes the positive "morning in America" spot run by Republican Ronald Reagan in his 1984 re-election bid. Like that ad, Obama's presents a narrative of U.S. recovery in an effort to woo swing voters. It reminds viewers just how grim things were in 2008, at the height of the financial meltdown, and presents Obama as someone who worked hard to improve the situation. But unlike Reagan, Obama doesn't have a clear-cut economic recovery to run on.
Fensom says: "With two weeks to prepare, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady will bring some wrinkles against a Giants defense that has been the best unit in the NFL since Week 16. That wrinkle, I think, will be a no huddle offense. The Patriots didn't huddle on roughly 25 percent of snaps during the regular season and that number will rise Sunday in an effort to fatigue the Giants pass rush. The Giants, though, will eventually start to reel in the Patriots. A seesaw second half will fall to the Giants because A.) their defense is more capable of making plays and B.) Eli Manning will unravel a Patriots defense that (still) lacks confidence.

It is unfathomable that the United States will be cutting off access to a college degree for the great majority of poor students in college today, especially at a time when we have dropped in international rankings of degree attainment.

Dear H.O.: Pashmina is being promoted as an alternative -- a legal alternative -- to shahtoosh. Technically, it is the fine underhair of the Himalayan Kashmir goat, which also exists in Mongolia; China; and Ladakh, India. (The fiber we know as cashmere, named for Kashmir, is taken from the Kel goat that lives in the Tibetan region of Central Asia and in China.) It is not, as has been reported, a combination of cashmere and silk. The Wildlife Protection Society of India says that pashmina goats from India are "easily bred, can be shorn annually and their natural colors are similar to shahtoosh colors." Unlike shahtoosh, which comes from an endangered species, the chiru antelope, which lives primarily in the Tibetan Plateau of China, pashmina goats are not endangered. Pashmina shawls first gained fame in Europe in 1796 when Napoleon gifted the future empress, Josephine, with such a shawl.

There have been a few signs in recent months that the economy finally might be turning around — ever so slowly.
McGuane has long been forming unforgettable people out of the dust and dirt of the country he knows best — characters that just get fuller and richer and less predictable. But unlike his last book, the story collection "Gallatin Canyon," with its tense, unsettling insights into marginalized characters, "Driving on the Rim" is reminiscent of the author's earlier, funnier work, like his second, picaresque novel, "The Bushwhacked Piano," from 1971. And yet, this is in no way a novel that could have been written in an author's 20s or even 30s (or maybe even 40s). The archaeology of Berl Pickett, the complex layering of memories, the behavioral ruts and yes, the full understanding of how difficult it can be to get one's wheels up and out require a bit of living — no shortcuts. This is a novel in which events matter so much less than the spirit in which we conduct ourselves and the lessons we learn.

"You have to try and give (a young franchise quarterback) an offense that is capable of A.) protecting him and B.) taking some of the load off him," Pollian said. "If you look at Peyton's career, every rookie quarterback struggles and quarterbacks are not comfortable until after about their fourth year. In their first year, they're simply flummoxed by the speed of the game and the complexity of it. They just barely survive. After an offseason they begin to learn what the game is all about. In the second year, they learn what the defense is trying to do to them. In the third year, they learn what they can do to the defense. In the fourth year, they're now capable of how to control an offense (and how) to manipulate a defense. That's the progression.

In the absurd position of being one of the highest-paid unemployed men in America, O'Brien needed outlets for his creative energy and his white-hot anger. He kept his staff on payroll and announced a 42-city tour that kept him busy and out there.

As a result of your dedication, the Maddie James Seaside Learning Center will break ground later this year, and shortly thereafter, Maddie's legacy will be seen in the smiling faces of area children for decades.

As evidence, he cites a visitor to 17th-century Cambridge who was shocked to witness swearing, drinking, rioting, and hatred of all piety and virtue.'  That could describe almost any frat house in the country or many of the Arrowhead tailgaters before the MU-KU border war.

At that point, no one had told Locane one person had died in the car she hit and another was in critical condition. Detectives said they refrained from telling Locane to ensure a candid statement. She learned of the death and injury after authorities finished questioning her, according to police. That’s when Locane’s smile and giggles disappeared, save for a moment when she posed in the hospital for a police file mug shot, according to authorities.
Good movies raise questions about life. Bad movies raise questions about Hollywood. "Real Steel" is one of those so-bad-it-might-be-good movies that raises the question, "Is this supposed to be a joke?"
While jersey sales will conceivably make up the bulk of Nike's NFL revenue, that won't happen for lack of alternative team products.
Meanwhile, the half a dozen monitors in Syria visited the southern province of Dara, where the revolution began in March 2011.
But the protests raised new doubts about the department's ability to make the required reforms. And, with so many Occupy-related complaints streaming into the department's Internal Affairs Division, police won't be able to complete several key investigations on time, placing the department in further violation of the agreement.
The album is a lot like Lambert — sassy, refreshingly honest, and a heck of a good time. Critics loved the CD, but so did her fellow musicians. That led to a record for the most nominations for a woman in the 44-year history of the CMAs and the second most overall. Both of her No. 1 hits were nominated in two categories, song and single of the year.
Sometimes, I wonder if some of us really understand what that means. With the L.A. riots now 20 years behind us and the Martin case before us, it is a good time to consider those words afresh, consider them in light of our noble ideals and too frequent failings, consider them as if it were you, looking for recourse after justice failed you -- again.
The Aggies are drenched in talent at the position, but only on paper. Senior Christine Michael, one of the nation's best when healthy, averaged 6 yards per carry before exiting with a knee injury last November. A broken leg sidelined him a little more than halfway through the previous season.

Spying on your child's Facebook account is not spying. It's called parenting!
You know how you shouldn't donate clothes to Goodwill without going through the pockets first? The same principle applies to eBay. Here's why: Some guy had a safe he'd acquired and been unable to open. So he sold it on eBay for $122.93. This would've been a good deal, except that the buyer cut it open and found $26,000 inside. He was kind enough to give the seller a positive review, which really seems like the least he could do.
Social issues, especially abortion, are gateways to the GOP nominating electorate: In today’s climate of economic fear, a candidate’s positions on social issues will not be decisive with his electorate — but they can be disqualifying. Perry — an evangelical Christian, like most Republican participants in Iowa’s caucuses and the South Carolina primary — emphatically qualifies.
The incentives "can be controversial," said the National Governors Association in a 2008 brief, adding that "even angels are in disagreement as to the economic growth benefits of tax credits."

He didn't leave it at that. The rapper opened "Umbrella," Rihanna's best song, with the verse he recorded for it's remix. He then turned the stage back over to the evening's star, who seemed energized by the encounter.
"Ultimately, this is about morality. What is at stake here is the very idea of America -- the America whose values have inspired the world and instilled in the hearts of its citizens the certainty that, no matter how hard we fight, no matter how dangerous our adversary, in the course of vanquishing our enemies we do not compromise our deepest values," he said. "We are America, and we hold ourselves to a higher standard. That is what is really at stake."

Every day for two years, he walked past until it hit him -- this plaza needs a mural, and he was the one to paint it. Luckily, facing the plaza was a long, blank wall on the back of the old triangular station house, which is still going as a diner called J's Hamburgers & Such. You can come up Piedmont Avenue and spot the clock tower, then step into the lunch room/waiting room opened in 1936. The morning sunlight angles through like in an Edward Hopper painting. Dash out the back door and there waiting is Car No. 159 on the C- line. It takes some imagination to ride it, as it exists in a 23-by-14-foot mural.
“We all hope that it will never need to be used, but a parent packet is a great way to stay up-to-date and informed,” Call said.

The first match I clearly remember was July 3, 2003. It was free hat night (that is not the reason I went), and Byron Alvarez scored a hat trick after being subbed into the match just after halftime. Since so many people had brand new hats, many of them ended up on the field. At this time the Timbers Army filled less than half of section 107, but still made an amazing amount of noise. At the time it kind of scared and intimidated me.
øThe camera has a full-size APS-C sensor - the same size as you'd find on a digital SLR such as the Canon Rebel T3i or Nikon D5000 - in a subcompact body that could easily fit in your pocket. It does this by ditching the mirror and viewfinder. All the composition is on the 3-inch LCD on the back of the camera. The NX200 has a huge 20-megapixel image sensor, and you won't have to worry about shutter lag - you can shoot seven frames per second.
"We tried to create some offense with our defense, and North responded really well and made some buckets around the basket and some and-ones," Patriots coach Mitch Stevens said. "But we just couldn't throw the ball in the ocean today. We settled for some outside shots. We hit two 3s in the last minute of the game, but other than that, it was pretty cold."

For the ECB, Mr. Trichet's deputy Vitor Constâncio, of Portugal, denounced the German plan as "dangerous." Credit-rating agencies would declare Greece to be in default on some of its debts—a so-called selective default. In that case, Mr. Constâncio warned, the ECB would refuse to accept Greek government bonds as collateral, dealing a death blow to Greek banks. France, Italy and Spain all supported Mr. Constâncio.

Geiger says the Russian government has committed $4 billion to the foundation. That money, in turn, is being used to build the infrastructure for the city, to create a high-tech university in partnership with MIT, and to invest in startups.

Since 1996, when Jeter arrived and the Yankees started winning World Series again, he has become a player distinguished by both the long haul and the big moments. Baseball stats are like rock strata, one season's accretions pile on top of another's. The geologists who examine these layers will determine that Jeter was the best offensive shortstop ever. He was also one almost nobody thinks was ever a doper.

In its tale of an emotional shut-in who learns to embrace life, get a pilot's license and speak Korean, "Yes Man" recalls some previous Carrey vehicles, notably "Liar Liar." (Chris Knight of the National Post newspaper put it this way: "Jim Carrey + oddly constraining superpower = box-office gold!") The tone of "Yes Man" isn't predominantly manic, however, and may throw some die-hard Carrey fans expecting the old shtick in high gear.

Then I headed over to the East side. Eight men rose to the occasion to calculate the plane paths here. Dave Kiff had his Verticalometer ready to go. This group included Eric Freed, Tom Edwards scribing coordinates and city Planning Commissioner Bob Hawkins, who gave me the cold shoulder. Apparently, he's not a fan.

Home of the world champions (for now): The San Francisco Giants play at Scottsdale Stadium, close to the action in the Valley of the Sun's most attractive town. There are plenty of options before and after the game, including a stop at the legendary Sugar Bowl, a pink-colored outpost of all things sweet – especially the ice cream sundaes.

That hasn't come by going big. If anything, San Francisco has witnessed a great shrinkage of its wine lists in favor of more focused and philosophically driven wine programs.

As an example he said American officials want to know who to talk to when Chinese hackers breach U.S. computer networks. And if there is a cyber incident in China, Lewis said, "we need the Chinese to feel confident that they can call us up and ask, 'was it you?', and get a straight answer."

"I will not allow people not to be present. I like to give everybody that feeling of absolute abandon, but it's not about 'Here's my solo and now I'm going to sit back and listen to Charlie rip.' That's not it. You have to truly listen to the music you're playing -- you're involved every second, and you can make decisions every second. You can subvert the chart, you can come in blasting and you can bury everybody -- if it's strong enough and it's cool and you do it with conviction. That's the kind of thing that should happen live, and it does in my band because I make sure that it happens."

Conservative operatives also say they are riding the support of donors upset with Democratic policies they perceive as anti-business.

But in many cases, an airline's misdeeds may not result in any measurable loss of time or money -- just annoyance and inconvenience. As a case in point, a colleague at SmarterTravel.com recently received a lengthy email about a series of difficulties with a trip to London, starting with inadequate notification of schedule changes from the online travel agency (OTA) she used to her inability to get advance seat assignments without paying hefty fees. Clearly, none of this entailed any loss of vacation time or money -- just hassle, uncertainty and annoyance. And she obviously can't justify a monetary claim against either the OTA or the airline.

After McFaul was elected sheriff in 1976, the paper dutifully covered his occasional legal difficulties, including a prophetic episode soon after the election.
