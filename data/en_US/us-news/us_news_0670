Obviously, the 4-star route posed quite a challenge.

The enactment of a protective tariff of, say, 30 percent on most imported goods and services could increase government revenue as much as half a trillion dollars annually. The resulting scramble to reopen or replace mothballed U.S. factories could hardly fail to create a welcome flood of new (albeit temporary) jobs. No other feasible reform would have as large an impact on either the nation's finances or its employment prospects.

Utility company speakers at the summit stressed that they believe the technical issues surrounding plug-ins are manageable, as long as work is done now to prepare for large numbers of vehicles within the next 10 years.
There's no reason to be anything but calm, the Capitals said. Most have been here before — facing a game that ultimately will determine the success or failure of everything they've accomplished to this point. Even those with minimal NHL playoff experience endured an often-unpredictable, sometimes tense 2011-12 season that tested the group's ability to come together and find an identity within a defensive system under the guidance of a rookie head coach.

Birds take care of us, and our planet. They pollinate plants, scatter seeds and eat an inestimable numbers of insects. The Ornithological Council offers this example: A single pair of adult warblers plucks caterpillars from countless leaves in the short time -- usually two or three weeks -- it takes their little ones to hatch and launch their own migratory adventures. Every plant saved is another fresh-air filter helping us breathe.

So, you know, that’s us. We don’t tend to see the long-term plan, we don’t believe in it, and that’s a failing. But we do live in the moment, and with a particular ferocity. Carpe diem, don’t you know? And that’s not such a bad thing.
Yet the State Department is cautious about confronting Chavez. Yes, last month it finally expelled Venezuela’s consul general in Miami, Livia Acosta Noguera — but only after Univision broadcast a recording of Noguera (at the country’s embassy in Mexico) exploring with a local hacker ways to cyberattack America’s nuclear facilities.

To get the full picture, just spend a day in a classroom. Or even a couple of hours. One consistently disruptive student can jeopardize an entire class's learning - yet often a teacher's hands are tied when it comes to disciplining this student. (But that's another article.) Standardized test scores don't do justice to a teacher's vast skill set she must tap on an hourly basis.

Production note: Here's some hot news from Cleveland regarding potholes.
I can't comment about the specifics of the bill you quoted but wish to point out that billed services don't represent actual hospital and doctor costs. Stanford (and other hospitals) have zero hope of collecting the gross amount, and their cost structures are not based on that. Their goal is closer to 20 percent, yet they publish these exorbitant bills hoping to get as much as they can. I'll bet Stanford didn't lose money on your father's treatment, but am sure they would like to have been paid more for it.
My buffalo popcorn chicken is a good example. It puts a delicious, low-calorie spin on a game day favorite -- chicken wings.

In my three years as an assistant professor at Portland State University, I have had the pleasure of working with engaged students from diverse backgrounds and with colleagues who genuinely care about their students' academic success and the quality of academic research. The PSU community has challenged me in my work as a teacher and researcher, and I am proud to work at a university where knowledge often benefits from and serves the city in which it resides. PSU's academic environment is all the more praiseworthy in that both faculty and students have done such great work while under considerable financial pressures.

Boats merely in transit through Canadian waters from Point A in the U.S. to Point B in the U.S. do not have to report. But as one Canadian immigration officer said, trying to play dumb and use the "in transit" rule when your intention is fishing is a great way to get into trouble.

Paul Blake, longtime executive producer at the Muny, stepped down, leaving a legacy of classic musicals produced right here, at breathtaking speed, with love and style - and a new generation of people who got to know those shows because of him.

McNellie, who turns 72 on June 17, was a longtime football player, football coach and teacher. The stress of putting out proverbial fires as a school administrator raised his blood pressure. When his doctor told him he needed an exercise program, he picked up running -- well, running halfway around the high school track and walking the other half, at first. Then half a track became three miles, and three miles became a half-marathon, and a half-marathon became a full marathon when Cleveland launched its event.

So it's likely that we're all facing a world with more individual economic agents and fewer employees. More small, very-focused companies and fewer big vertically integrated ones. Intense specialization and role playing in the workforce rather than jacks-of-all-trades. Risk shifted from employers to individuals — but rewards shifted in that direction too.

"He is now the ‘Rat of Hudson,’ and that is putting it mildly," Manzo’s defense lawyer, Peter Willis, told the judge at Tuesday’s hearing. "He is no longer welcome in Hudson County. … He will continue to suffer as a result of those three days on the witness stand for the rest of his life."

In America today one the biggest issues we face is our ailing debt. Many people think they have the solution to turn our financial situation from a debt to a surplus, but nothing has fixed it yet. I honestly don't have the solution to our debt crisis and either does anyone else in America. If we had a solution don't you think that it would have been done already?

I do not think anyone has a real solution, including our own president, but I am hopeful that a solution will come to our rescue in the future.

Maryland would benefit from the South Korea deal in particular. An increase in American trade with the Asian nation is likely to boost business at the Port of Baltimore, which is in the midst of an upgrade that will give it a key competitive advantage over other East Coast ports after the Panama Canal is expanded to allow larger cargo ships in 2014. South Korea is Maryland's 14th largest export market, according to the Business Roundtable, a Washington advocacy group that is supporting the pact. Maryland exports bituminous coal, engines for passenger vehicles, parts for lab instruments, agricultural products and various specialized raw materials to Korea, and a free trade agreement would instantly make the state's businesses more competitive against suppliers from Europe, which recently signed its own trade deal with Korea.

One sign of the still-tough job market is long-term unemployment: Forty-three percent of the unemployed - 5.3 million Americans - have been out of work six months or more. Most of the economists blame weak customer demand. Only about a third think the main reason is a mismatch between the skills workers have and the skills employers need.
If not this concept, then what?
The company has enforced rules that have earned it a reputation as having one of the strictest dress codes in the corporate world. And the dress code has become part of the Disney corporate lore. Until 2010, women were required to wear pantyhose with skirts and couldn't wear sleeveless tops. Even now, straps have to be at least 3 inches wide.
The defense shield is one of Obama's top military programs. Soon after he took office in 2009, he revamped a Bush administration missile defense plan that had been a chief source of tension with Russia. The Russian government believed the program is aimed at its missiles, while the U.S. said the system was designed to counter any Iranian missile threat.

Looking to come out of day two with a speedy wide receiver, the Jets traded their second round (47), fifth round (154th) and seventh round (232) picks to move up four spaces and secure the Georgia Tech wideout. With the departure of wideout Plaxico Burress this offseason, Hill would make an ideal fit for the team’s No. 2 receiver spot.
It should have come easier, Mets manager Terry Collins said. The Mets (13-9) hounded Jamie Moyer, the 49-year-old Rockies starter, with 11 hits in five innings — but they only plated four runs. David Wright continued his torrid April, notching two more hits and walking three times.

Chile's main seaport, in Valparaiso about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from Santiago, was ordered closed while damage was assessed. Two oil refineries shut down, and lines of cars snaked out of service stations across the country as nervous drivers rushed to fill up.
A: The Peace Bridge between Buffalo, N.Y., and Ft. Erie, Ontario, was built in the 1920s by a private company, but that company went into bankruptcy during the Depression, and a public authority took over. That's one scenario why most border crossings today are in public hands. Another reason is that the customs and border security functions require a level of government involvement that the public demands should be in public, not private, hands.

Although the Enterprise was built to blast into space, propelled by booster rockets, it only made a few test flights in the Mojave Desert on the back of a carrier jet. There were five trial runs, leading up to the separation of the shuttle and the plane in midair.

Marine Corps veterans and Stevens students Ben Choe and RJ Polunin said the school has supported them well.
The "congressman doesn't know Robert Blagojevich. Has never met with Robert Blagojevich. Has never had a conversation with Robert Blagojevich and has never sent any emissaries to meet or have conversations with Robert Blagojevich," Jackson's attorney, Paul Langer said Thursday. The "congressman continues to fully cooperate with the House subcommittee. He has not been asked to provide any additional information or documentation to the committee. His response is posted on that entity's Web site."
As Hunter suggested, business or ideological reasons rather than ethnic solidarity may well motivate contributions that otherwise hint at an ethnic connection. Xiong’s opponent Valadao, for instance, has raked in donations from the Valley’s Portuguese-American dairy farmers. Maybe they like his ethnicity, maybe they like his own dairy background, maybe they like something that cannot be easily summed up.
Preliminary figures indicate the Francis Howell School District has 17,244 students, down by 46 from last year.

But that is just the atmosphere, which is honestly reason enough alone to visit this Newark spot. They are also known for the variety of beer that they offer. You will find 120 different bottle beers and 16 on tap. Patrons who drink at least 100 different beers will be honored on a plaque as a member of the bar's century club. They also offer a full food menu and most entrees are under $10. This is a great place to visit if you want to relax in good company, but don't want to spend a lot of money. It is also a great place to watch sports. You can find Yankee and Mets games here, and for my fellow Yankee fans, you can keep an eye on Boston because there is even a television reserved for the Red Sox station.

The space, in a fairly typical Lenexa strip mall at 79th Street and Quivira Road, has taken on an appealing glow of rejuvenation, thanks to a new coat of paint in vibrant hues of tangerine, kiwi and butter yellow. Adding to the ambience are an illuminated green and blue bar and a ceiling baffle laced with delicate silk panels that flutter like a mobile from the activity below.
In the first, he spends time with some Mediterraneans who are trying to protect their songbirds from local poachers. In the second, he retraces the path and environmental impact of a cute made-in-China toy. (There's some Asian bird watching, as well.) Both are interesting and complex - Franzen plays golf on a Chinese course and explores the influence of "the Cypriot hunting lobby," among other tangents - but, in the end, they're just magazine pieces.
These are small indignities; more grievous is the film’s lack of dramatic tension. It lingers intolerably on some inessential scenes, rushes through others, and fails to provide any motivation either for Poe’s devoted (albeit fictional) love, or the film’s archvillain. Most of the players remain almost defiantly uncharismatic.
When Sam Yagan isn't investing time helping young tech companies in Chicago raise money through the Excelerate Labs program, he is running the New York-based matchmaking site OKCupid.com.

We'd like to think that 40 minutes of basketball will help us try and figure out why the Selection Committee gave a "meh" Gators team a gift No. 2-seed. Probably won't happen, though and neither will a UCSB win. Florida, 88-76.
On Oscar night, each TV entertainment show will have its own suite backstage, where gushing anchors will not only greet winners with a hug normally reserved for college roommates at a 20th class reunion, but also an expensive present. I have been observing the Oscars scene for more than two decades, and this gift-giving is a recent phenomenon. But it is now standard operating procedure for TV shows. The anchors will ask a couple of moronic questions, and then try to convince the Oscar winners to participate in some inane game, just to show the audience that they are all the best of friends.
The first polls planned by the Stockton Polling Institute will gauge preferences in this fall’s elections, including the 3rd Congressional District race pitting incumbent Republican Rep.

What to do: Reassure a child she's beautiful, and ask why she's feeling insecure. Brainstorm ways to live healthfully without banning any particular foods: a weekly dessert night instead of a regular supply of sweets, maybe, or family walks after dinner. Educate her on good food choices and how to follow hunger cues. Help her find ways to be successful, whether through sports or the arts, and nurture her friendships. Schedule a checkup with a pediatrician and, if symptoms continue, seek counseling.

Built on raised concrete slabs, the tent cabins are furnished with four squeaky, metal-framed beds with lots of scratchy wool blankets — it's a good idea to bring your own cotton or silk sleep-sack — a small but overachieving wood-burning stove and a card table. The canvas walls and roof are taken down at the end of each season.

Clecak introduced the video, "For My Mother," which featured local philanthropist Jack Shaw, who with his wife Ellen Shockro are past Dove Award recipients, speaking for the first time about growing up in a domestic violence home, where his father beat up and verbally abused his mother.

Nieuwenhuis, 24, has gone from being a star at the Denver small-school level to a starting center fielder with the Mets in just seven years, since leaving town to play college baseball at Azusa Pacific University, an NAIA Christian school near Los Angeles.

At the outset of the season, the Sox broke camp with Lastings Milledge on the roster, only to have to send him down out of necessity. Considering the team's overall struggles, trouble in the leadoff spot, etc. why haven't we heard his name in months? It seems as though he could've been consideration for a call-up instead of Alejandro De Aza. -- Shane Seddon; Las Vegas
Just make sure you're confident in your facts and prepared for any consequences before you act, since any choice is likely to alienate someone. If you're not willing to risk your relationship with the brother, or if your husband isn't, then that decides it.

Yet funding constraints and conflicts over how to develop the park ended up dooming a 1993 plan for it. Planners envisioned that about half of the site would be a ceremonial plaza with an open-air pavilion, festival promenade, outdoor amphitheater, playgrounds and a labyrinth created out of plants, picnic areas, a bike trail and ball fields. The rest would be preserved vernal pools and floodplain.

Mr. O'Malley won the election by 268,642 votes and had margins of victory in Baltimore City and Prince George's County of 106,995 votes and 177,801 votes, respectively.

The names alone of the birds we saw boggled the imagination: hawk-eagle, puffbird, motmot, toucan, treerunner, spinetail, and foliage-gleaner. The antbirds, understandably, posed identity problems, with antshrike, antvireo, antwren, antthrush, antpitta, and antbirds to keep us confused.

In New Jersey, a school anti-bullying coordinator told the Star-Ledger that "The Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights" has "added a layer of paperwork that actually inhibits us" in dealing with problems. In surveying the effects of the law, the Star-Ledger reports that while it is "widely used and has helped some kids," it has imposed costs of up to $80,000 per school district for training alone and uses about 200 hours per month of staff time in each district, with some educators saying that the additional effort is taking staff "away from things such as substance-abuse prevention and college and career counseling."

The most infamous brawl in NBA history—Malice in the Palace—started when Indiana's Ron Artest (now Metta World Peace) fouled Detroit's Ben Wallace late in the game.

Len was afraid when he saw Donald's costume that he was going to be a walking "Ferrero Rocher." (Mmm, hazelnuts.)

China produces 600,000 engineering graduates a year; the United States produces just 70,000. In math and science, the United States ranks a desultory 25th out of 29 developed nations. The war for talent, and the ability to produce that talent, is a global one, and we have a lot of work to do. We cannot allow board or leadership squabbles to get in the way. Our children, and their children, will miss out if we are not up to the challenge.

Alabama 27, Mississippi State 21: A dangerous game for the Tide, which essentially had its season mortally wounded with last week’s loss to LSU.

"In these challenging economic times, many local leaders around the country who have done nothing illegal are finding themselves the targets of angry voters who are expressing their feelings - often in destructive ways - about budget cuts or other issues at the ballot box," Cochran said in a press release to unveil the video. "We have produced this documentary not only to educate our mayors, but also, to help educate the general public about the economic and political costs of recall elections."

-- Great to see recognition for Rooney Mara, who brings complexity to a badass in "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." And I'm very much in favor of the love for Kristen Wiig, who's not just funny but endearing and vulnerable in "Bridesmaids" (her performance required a lot more than Melissa McCarthy, who was left off the list). Once again, however, Glenn Close ("Albert Nobbs") takes a spot better suited for Elizabeth Olsen ("Martha Marcy May Marlene") or Kirsten Dunst ("Melancholia"). I realize those are Oscar long shots, but I'm going to keep singing this song until voters sing it with me. (Not going to happen, I know, I know.)

After struggling last season, Elliott was traded by the Senators to Colorado, where he finished the season and then signed with the Blues. Not knowing what his reception from fans would be like Thursday at All-Star draft, Elliott was pleasantly surprised.
He did not comment further on the matter.
This year, the repeal bill had record numbers of co-sponsors: 66 in the House and 19 in the Senate. Although most senators support repealing the death penalty, there are only five votes and not the six-vote majority needed in the Senate committee that considers the legislation. The Senate leadership controls the committee system, which at present thwarts the will of the majority.
A: Every bottle, every glass. It's an Italian thing. Since glass is porous it tends to absorb aromas around it, such as old cabinet, dishwasher, etc. To prime, you pour 1/2 ounce into one glass, swirl, then transfer it to the next glass so you are only getting the taste and aroma the wine.
Nothing ever came easy, though. Fieldston had to fight back from down two sets against Poly Prep late in the season to preserve its undefeated campaign. It had to come back from a 22-14 deficit in the third set against Chapin in the NYSAISAA semifinals to make its first final since 2003. And then, to put an exclamation point on an unbelievable season, the Eagles came back from down set point, 24-21, in the third against Brearley to win that set and the match, 29-27, 17-25, 27-25, 25-22, to earn the state crown.

Of course, reality and the UN often have little to do with each other. North Korea and now Iran have skillfully exploited that fact; they used the privileges they won for signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty to facilitate their nuclear programs. (By the way, the two remaining Axis of Evil powers increasingly cooperate with each other. According to Seoul media, Iranian rocket scientists attended the recent Korean launch.)
On any given day, the restaurant also serves hundreds of the dosa masala ($6.50), a long, loosely rolled crepe filled with a mash of potatoes, accompanied by sambar, a mildly spicy lentil soup. Other offerings span the country: uttappam ($5.25), a griddled pancake embedded with onions and tomatoes; dahi pakori ($4.25), ground lentil dumplings soaked in hot water and served with yogurt, mint and tamarind chutney, a mild dish that acts as a cool foil to some the spicier ones; and pakora ($4.25), vegetables blended into a batter, formed into a ball and fried - a great accompaniment to the milky chai ($1) that's always behind the pay stand.
A lava flow of Swiss cheese on a smoked roast beef sandwich snuffed out any smokiness, and the horseradish aioli went missing ($11). Still, good bread and onions, peppers and arugula hinted this dish is a good one when the components are in place and balanced.
Work is something that is not foreign - or unwelcome - for Skinner.
An unsubtle meditation on the obsessive nature of artistic creation — Nathan pursues his goal as resolutely as Ahab went after his great white whale — the piece, strongly directed by David Schweizer, has its moments. As played by the bald, stocky Eckert with an old-fashioned tape player slung around his neck and a belt of duct tape, Nathan makes a haunting figure. John Torres and Caleb Wertenbaker’s set design — with its bare bulbs, old-fashioned tape players hung from the ceiling and a piano bound with rope as if it’s cargo on a sailing ship — imaginatively reflects the show’s themes.
Now a Tribune/WGN-TV investigation reveals how much those lucrative pensions could end up costing taxpayers.

After the crash, Woodson Terrace police stopped the pickup truck driver and arrested him on suspicion of driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, Heisse said.
A huge problem facing the Transportation Trust Fund is that billions of dollars of motorist-paid funds (gas tax, titling tax, vehicle registration and Motor Vehicle Administration fees) are being spent supporting two major mass transit systems, with 50 percent of TTF funds spent just on transit operating costs. Fares paid by transit riders cover only a fraction of the operating costs, yet mass transit systems handle less than 10 percent of local travel, while highways and bridges are choked with the remaining 90 percent. This is not sustainable. Out-of-control operating costs must be contained and other, broader-based funding sources identified to separate mass transit operating spending from highway spending.
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency says it plans to regulate wastewater discharged by companies producing natural gas from shale formations, including chemically laced water used in a controversial extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing.
The sheer size of Burnham and Wanamaker's creation can be underestimated against the contemporary skyscraper-dominated skyline.
I am not sure how to handle the situation, or if it should even be approached. We didn't give her an explanation for our choice, as we didn't foresee the commentary that would follow.

Newt has an answer for any big question. The substance of the answer is always well articulated; the question of affordability, not so much. And therein begins a series of problematic attributes that follow Newt the candidate, and have surrounded Newt the politician, for years.
The loss of 36,000 jobs in a snow-swept February, Gault said, can be viewed as a good sign. Minus the storms that raised havoc along the East Coast, he said, unemployment - which went from 10 percent in January to 9.7 percent in February - might have shown even more improvement.
Then again, this is a coach they call "Big Balls Kelly" around the Oregon campus, and he didn't have a first down in mind. A wide-open De'Anthony Thomas turned a screen pass into a 41-yard touchdown, a 22-9 lead, and a sense among the sellout crowd - everyone aside from that lively pocket of Oregon partisanship in the northeast corner - that things might not end well.
Walker and Kleefisch say local governments including school boards around Wisconsin are realizing savings because of his controversial decision to end collective bargaining rights for public sector unions.

Yet, on the game's most crucial possession, Bryant couldn't have expressed his feelings toward Bynum ever more clearly. After chasing down Denver forward Al Harrington for a steal, Bryant drove down the court and easily could've finished on his own. Instead, Bryant connected with Bynum for a two-handed slam that gave the Lakers a 97-91 lead with 2:15 remaining, causing Denver to call timeout and securing the win.

For the first time, the city health department included a question about bedbugs on its annual community health survey. In 2009, it found, more than 6 percent of New Yorkers — one in 15 adults — said they had battled the pests in the past year. Until the AP reported those results earlier this year, data had been limited to government statistics on bedbug complaints and private pest control company surveys.

While the miniseries starts off with a chilling and promising tale, none of it would have the same impact if it weren’t for the art of Richard Corben.
