A native of the Dominican Republic, which shares Haiti on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, Julia Alvarez poignantly describes Haiti as "like a sister I've never gotten to know." So this most recent account of her ongoing love affair with the deep feelings of Julia Alvarez combines three elements - her promise to travel to the wedding of a young Haitian, Piti, whom she has met working in the Dominican fields; her prickly relationship with Bill, her husband; and her bereft noticing of the mental decline of her aged parents. At least for this last element, she seems authentically aware of others, so that her brief evocations of her mother and father and of her own grief are touching.

One is for families. We triple the child tax credit -- child deduction. Why? Because families are taxed higher now than they've ever been. Why? Because the child deduction continues to go down over time. Families back in the 1950s in the heydays of Detroit -- they didn't pay taxes. Why? Because we understood the stress of raising children and the economic stress and how finances and economics can be a stress on families and marriages. And so we had a government that said, "We're going to support you."

Fortunately, the thrill of Sherlock Holmes was never so much plot as character. The cases came and went and our eyes were always on the man at the center - seduction through deduction. "Smart is the new sexy," concurs this Adler, only there's nothing new about it. We've always thrilled to both the character's obsession with facts and his fractured attraction to those around him, and Cumberbatch, the most physically beautiful man to inhabit the role thus far, infuses his Sherlock with a passion that is as dangerously intense as it is highly selective.

A tropical paradise is particular in its pleasures, and Honolulu has that universally popular combination of sun, sand and surf. Surfers from the world over come to enjoy a sport that islanders invented, and it is as common to see people carrying surfboards though town as it is to see people carrying golf clubs around Palm Beach.

"Almost as soon as I began writing for magazines and newspapers," Geoff Dyer tells us in the introduction to "Otherwise Known as the Human Condition: Selected Essays and Reviews," "I hoped one day to see my articles published in book form." This is both obvious (what writer doesn't want to see his or her short pieces collected?) and revelatory. Such a collection is generally regarded as a sideline effort at best, and yet, the argument here goes, that's completely wrong.
A jam would seem an unlikely ingredient to be overlooked.

Wits and Wagers Family (North Star, $20; 3-10 players; age 8+; 20 min.) The "Family" designation on this new version of the great trivia game Wits and Wagers turns out to mean something different from what you might expect. The questions are not any easier or more kid-friendly than in the original (unless your 11-year-old knows how many mummies were found in King Tut's tomb or how long an average honeybee lives in the wild). Instead, this is "family" as in "family values": they've gotten rid of the bets and the odds - which was kind of the point of the exercise. Too bad; if they'd kept the game play intact and softened up the questions, that would've been something.

Notable: A bad back has prevented him from having the kind of season he -- and the Cavs -- envisioned when he signed a one-year free-agent contract, but he's still able to provide leadership in the locker room, another reason the team brought him back.

But with “Safe,” working with choreographer J.J. Perry (“Haywire”), that strategy pays off. A slow-building B-movie thriller, the plot is nothing new for Statham. There's a girl in need of his protection from assorted gangs of bad men. But the dialogue crackles with flinty one-liners.
Still, newcomers and transients continue to proclaim that Los Angeles has no history. Perhaps it suits them to be dismissive because it protects them from this city's allure.

Now move on to the clams in foie gras broth ($13), an uncommon concept, for sure. But here they merge into a locomotive of flavors: salt of the ocean, warmth of the meat flavors and a flabbergasting (relative) tenderness of big honkin' clams. For clam and meat lovers, this is bliss.

Recently restored from the lone remaining hand-colored print, the new edition of Georges Méliès' 1902 sci-fi classic "A Trip to the Moon" — prominently featured in Martin Scorsese's "Hugo" — includes a soundtrack by the French pop band Air, who mix lush orchestration, stormy electronica and murmuring voices to lend some of Méliès' scenes more drama. But it's the filmmaker's pointy-hatted astronauts and mushroom-festooned lunar caverns that are still the stars of this show. Méliès had a showman's flair as he experimented with special effects like a kid with a new camcorder. The new DVD and Blu-ray of "A Trip to the Moon" include a documentary about Méliès and alternate audio tracks (for those not so fond of the Air score).

Not "vote for Measure Q." Incidentally, "Measure Q Improves School Safety." "Measure Q Improves the Learning Environment." And if you want kids to be safe and well-educated, well, you'll know what to do when you get into the voting booth. The district is just giving you the information.

Lead author Charles Mobbs, a neuroscientist at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, said that this study -- in which mice were fed a high-fat diet of 5% carbohydrate, 8% protein and a whopping 87% fat -- was the first to show that dietary intervention alone is enough to reverse kidney failure caused by diabetes.

But the Red Sox added to their lead in the ninth. Against Coke, Darnell McDonald singled to right and Ross, the pinch-hitter, blooped a single just fair down the rightfield line out of the reach of the second baseman Raburn.
