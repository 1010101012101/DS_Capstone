Last week, Schmitt's 1992 doctorate was revoked after a university committee, following up on a report published in January by the Internet publication HVG.hu, found that most of his thesis about the modern Olympic Games had been copied from the work of two other authors. Schmitt had won two gold metals at the 1968 and 1972 Olympics on his country's fencing teams.

It's kind of funny how everything came back full-circle for Seton Hall Tuesday night. From George Blaney being on the UConn sidelines for the Pirates' first win in 11 years to Tommy Amaker's Harvard Crimson losing to Fordham on the same night, potentially opening the door for a Seton Hall showing in the Top 25. But the 9-0 number is the start at home for the Pirates — their best since the Amaker days. Not since Amaker's second season of 1998-99, when Seton Hall began 8-0 at home, have the Pirates enjoyed such a good showing in their own building to start a season.
The incident has separately spawned an investigation into a patrol car camera video that reportedly shows the officer with what appears to be an AK-47-style weapon in the first confrontation.

When a wave of frustration and outrage about the killing of Trayvon Martin crashed across North America, there is no doubt that countless Michigan residents were caught up in the tide of a public debate that began to ebb only after George Zimmerman, the admitted killer of the unarmed 17-year-old, was arrested. As opinions flew, some condemned Florida for its stand-your-ground law, unaware that Michigan has its own law that contains many of the features that have been the source of so much controversy in Florida.

The notion of bridges, of connections -- of helixes, as he likes to put it -- is a key one, because Weschler is a writer with an idea. As with all enthusiasts, the idea is both simple and immensely complicated, having in his case to do with seeing, with "waking people, and myself, up to the possibilities. Slapping people. Notice. Take notice. This is amazing. This is so cool."

Voters last November overwhelmingly approved a county charter that replaces 200 years of commissioner rule with an elected county executive and 11-member council.
Bathrooms are increasingly important when it comes time to selling a property, too—enough to warrant stealing space from the master bedroom, or taking it over completely. "People are really investing in master bathrooms," says James Lentaigne, sales and marketing director of Drummonds, British makers of handcrafted, classic bathroom fittings. "They're spending money on freestanding basins with their own legs and large towel rails and deep, freestanding bathtubs that defy trends," he adds. "They're so worried about things going out of fashion that they're now veering toward durable, traditional designs that never go out of style." (Even Marc Newson, the cutting-edge Australian designer known for his space-age shapes, chose a freestanding Drummonds "Usk" bateau bathtub for his own bathroom.)

In a world of bombastic noise levels, this refined restaurant is like a soothing sound chamber, with comfortable padded chairs and soft music playing in the background. Its butter-toned color scheme is a quiet backdrop to Ian Begg's boldly flavored food in dishes such as Dungeness crab salad layered with citrus, avocado mousse, radish and frisee, or pan-seared foie gras with Brussels sprouts and golden raisin sauce.

Kyle McClellan pitched a scoreless ninth to salvage a win in the series.
The attitude that has long infused Portland's alternative schools -- that troubled teens can't be expected to graduate and that just getting them to show up is a victory -- has also defined Portland's general approach to the dropout problem. Grant makers and school board members praised the district for its creativity and partnerships in addressing the dropout issue, even as the schools kept failing huge numbers of students. Good intentions were rewarded, not results. If New York and Philadelphia can improve their graduation rates, what excuse does Portland have not to do so, too?

The food truck trend has hit Baltimore pretty hard within the last year and it seems like every week a new one pops up. The debate as to whether this is a good or a bad thing for local merchants has been covered pretty thoroughly so I won’t get into that. However, I’m of the opinion that competition for the hearts and stomachs of Baltimoreans ultimately steps up everyone’s game and give us, the consumer, better and more delicious options to choose from. The options at “The Gathering” varied from pizza to Ethiopian fare, lobster rolls to cupcakes.

I've spent a lot of time trying to psychoanalyze the large, primarily female audience and what exactly causes otherwise discerning and intelligent moviegoers to go gaga over this silly and increasingly ludicrous love story.
"They both seem very interested in that aspect and it's something I feel like I have quite a bit of experience at," said Roberts, who is second on the Orioles' career stolen-base list with 274 and had four seasons of 30-or-more steals. "I think that if I'm here, I need to use it for a reason. I saw Jones working on some base-stealing stuff during spring training, and that's when I went to him and said, 'Hey, if you ever want to talk about it let me know.' So we started doing some work before games, and tried to find ways for each of them to add another dimension to their game and help our team in another dimension."
But the embrace of gay marriage is likely to inspire the Democratic base as much as it might turn off persuadable centrists, Nick said. He called the issue "sort of a net wash" in North Carolina.
The newspaper reported that in one case, Romney and several schoolmates held down classmate John Lauber and cut off his bleached blond hair after seeking him out in his dorm room at their boarding school in the wealthy Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The Post said Lauber was "perpetually teased for his nonconformity and presumed homosexuality" and that he screamed for help as Romney held him down. The paper recounted another incident in which Romney shouted "atta girl" to a different student at the all-boys' school who, years later, came out as gay.

"When you start talking about trophies and championships and all these accolades in the regular season, we stop thinking about the next shift or the next game," Blues captain David Backes said. "We start thinking about we need ... eight of 10 points or who's got more regulation or overtime wins. That doesn't help us concentrate and have an edge and focus on what we need to focus on to win games. That distracts us and we need to be more mentally strong and push that stuff aside and get back on task."
The best news for Portman is that his job approval has been rising. He started in January with 34 percent, with a majority of voters not knowing enough to assess his performance. (Since his seat was barely warm, that 34 percent should be taken as little more than a sign of faith.) His 41 percent approval marks a high point in his young Senate career.

"You don't really have a chance of winning," she said as she headed to work. "I know people who bought $30 or $40 worth, and you figure all the other people are doing that too. And nobody hit the big one. I don't have much money to spend."
"I would say the main thing would be getting my elbow raised up. A lot of times in college, my elbow would drop below my shoulder, and when you do that, you lose velocity, you lose accuracy, you're less consistent with your throws," Osweiler said.

Hauerwas talked briefly about the social constructions that surround our conceptions of disability before he moved on to the heart of his lecture. At its heart, Hauerwas lifted up the reality that more often than not individuals express and make sense of their experiences of suffering, particularly the suffering of disability, through story. Rather than attempting to abstractly explain the experience, we narrate it. By narrating these experiences, the stories allow for deep experiences of empathy. The narratives open themselves up in powerful ways to various personal understandings of the suffering experienced.

The book, by Timothy Mason, also reflects Dr. Seuss in one key detail: Everything rhymes. It's amazing how those simple rhymes make the actors' words easy to follow.

Now, I know there are two schools of thought about cruises. Some folks shiver at the very word, preferring to be tarred and feathered rather than being forced to have dinner with the same people every night, or being subjected to the (perceived) torture of watching third-rate Broadway musicals and learning how to fold napkins in the shape of a swan. At the other extreme are people like the couple I met on the way to the cruise terminal in Barcelona. They confided that this was their 73rd time aboard a Crystal ship.

As for which grade to use for which purpose, Fathallan says, "Grade A is perfect for pancakes, desserts and when you want a pure maple taste. You don't need to use Grade A for cooking. It's like wine. You don't use your best wine for cooking, either. Grade B is for cooking and baking only. It has a more intense taste that is good in muffins, breads and on pork chops."
Kuhlmann is hoping his team can compete in the AAA and avoid the injury bug. Once the postseason rolls around, the Cougars will shift from what is primarily a Class 4 conference into the Class 2 playoffs.
Still, I'm not sure how I'll cope in the coming months. Will my heart race every time I hear a car stop outside the house, worrying that it has brought an Army casualty notification team? Should I try to keep abreast of developments overseas, worrying myself sick? Or should I purposely avoid the news in this paper and on TV, pretending all is well, that my son is OK, even if days have passed without a word from him?

To avoid those shortages, we must figure out how to improve our schools and reduce the dropout rate. We must persuade more young people to get college or technical training after high school - and stay here after they get it.

We were listening to music when the bus came to a dead stop. We had apparently barely missed a downpour that seemed to have pounded half the mountain down into the road. We were stuck behind a platform of impassable, red mud. Another bus faced us, trapped from the other direction. I looked around for reassurance. All the other passengers, who were locals, seemed unconcerned and disinterested. I craned to see as the bus drivers climbed out and rummaged through the luggage compartment. They pulled out shovels and started digging. After about an hour, we were free.
The NBA had only eight teams in 1960 when West and Robertson were rookies. There were fewer jobs, and the ones that were open were filled by players who had spent multiple years in college.

Answer: Although you are not in a targeted area, it sounds like your plants have what is called oleander leaf scorch, a bacteria transmitted by sharpshooter insects. Symptoms can often mimic salt burn or drought stress, to some extent. For drought stress, the leaves on all branches of a healthy plant will yellow uniformly and drop at the same time. In leaf scorch, the yellowing of the leaves progresses from the tip or leaf margins inward. In a drought situation, the plant will recover when watered. With leaf scorch, water won't help because the bacteria have plugged the xylem tubes, limiting the flow of water to the affected branches. You can prune affected branches for aesthetic purposes, but most likely the new shoots will soon be affected also.

The cops, Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), operate in a parallel universe. They struggle to pull together evidence from Bay Area police forces and jurisdictions that barely communicate with one another, let alone cooperate with one another, while the Chronicle guys second-guess them, follow their own leads and get in the way. Switching back and forth between the two panels of the diptych structure makes for repetitiveness, but it does prove informative; one has a sense of intelligent, highly motivated men making their way through endless mazes of clues, intuitions, misapprehensions and misinformation.

Reisinger said he won't pass judgment on whether the officer's involvement is evidence of further troubles, although he acknowledged the Police Department has faced recent problems.

The other reason has to do with the status of theatrical exhibitors as the weakest link in the 3-D process. (Some theaters have already been caught reducing light levels on the screen to extend the life of expensive projector lamps.) What happened to me and others at the ArcLight the other night was the height of absurdity. Here we were watching a production that cost somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter-billion dollars. Yet our enjoyment was compromised by button batteries that can't cost more than a buck a pop. And we were an invited audience, privileged to see an advance screening, not moviegoers paying hefty premiums for their 3-D experience. I shudder to think what they see.

The rationale for the mandate goes beyond the issue of personal responsibility. It's also an integral part of Congress' effort to stop insurers from excluding people with preexisting medical problems. That sort of cherry-picking leaves millions of Americans unable to find affordable coverage. To combat that, the law requires insurers to expand their risk pools, offering coverage to all applicants at prices based only on their age, locale, family status and tobacco use, not their medical records. But these requirements could have the perverse effect of inducing people to drop coverage whenever they're healthy, signing up for policies only when they know they need expensive treatment. Such "adverse risk selection," as economists call it, would result in insurers covering only the sickest people, sending premiums through the roof. To minimize that problem, Congress added a requirement that all adult Americans carry insurance at all times.
The red wines we selected were softer-edged reds, such as Merlot and Zinfandel. "If there are any dry red wines that would go, it would probably be Petite Sirah and Zinfandels," Jardim said, citing the big, jammy flavors. But even though the desserts weren't particularly sweet, the reds didn't pair well.

Without the state subsidizing purses, there is no real financial incentive for owners to race their horses.
Matthews didn't start, but played more minutes than Batum, Miller and Rudy Fernandez. Miller's playing time was guaranteed to drop from last season, but he played just 26 minutes tonight, and it wasn't because he was particularly ineffective. It was simply a matter of Matthews changing the game in so many ways that McMillan can't bring himself to sub him out.

When you're reading Tweets from celebrities who hire ghost Tweeters to handle their image-making, says Erin Biba in Wired magazine. Of the 250 million posts published every day, many are by hired professionals. In our social-media-obsessed culture, capturing the most followers can be a "blood sport," costing celebrities money and reputation. So ghost writers and impersonators become a natural part of the game.

When the team folded after 1982. There were about 9,000 die-hards who kept going to Civic Stadium in that last year. Even with the pain of that wound, I am just incredibly happy that the current ownership and the new generation of fans actively appreciate our history. The effort that the original Timbers put forth to entertain us and then to grow the game in Portland has a lot to do with this opportunity we now have.

Since Kelly arrived, the Ducks are 34-6. But during that time, former quarterback Jeremiah Masoli was booted, in part, for being cited for possession of marijuana following a traffic stop in 2010. Ex-cornerback Cliff Harris, who was pulled over in June 2011 for driving 118 mph and told police who asked about apparent marijuana use that he and others in the car "smoked it all," was finished in December after a marijuana bust in California.
The natural question is how Sanchez could make the long throws from third to first if he continues to struggle physically throwing from second.

By staging the show in the round, he creates a you-are-there immediacy, but also underlines the play’s concern with the need to belong and communication breakdowns.

Just recently, a business partner and I leased a new space for our 10-year-old fitness gym. (I do, after all, enjoy having my hand in different pies.) The space needed to be completely renovated.

But for Indio, Coachella — and the business it generates — are what matter.
Through 11 avante-garde songs that run the gamut of Americana, powerpop and noise rock, Wilco paints a landscape of a troubled America in the early 2000s. Sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrific, always challenging and inaccessible, it's a record that requires repeat listens. Some songs allow their thematic value to float readily to the surface like dead fish (see "War On War" and "Ashes of American Flags"), while others find post- 9/11 beauty in simple subtleties.
Israel immediately shot back, killing the head of a group called the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC). The attack left dead four PRC members and a young boy who was with them. Since then, Palestinians have fired more than 160 rockets into Israeli cities. At least one Palestinian missile landed in Egypt, injuring an Egyptian woman. Israel has fired back, targeting other militant leaders. More civilians have died on both sides. As always, Palestinians are aiming at -- and occasionally hitting -- civilian targets. Israelis are aiming at militant targets, but innocent civilians are also getting killed by Israeli fire.
We returned for a weekday lunch visit, this time sticking with the traditional. A cup of Italian Wedding Soup ($2.29) was generously filled with tiny meatballs and spinach in a rich chicken broth. My wife's Linguine With White Clam Sauce ($7.99) was buttery and garlicky with plenty of tender clams. My Santos Sub ($5.99) was simple but perfect: a crunchy hoagie bun filled with ham, salami, pepperoni, melted provolone, lettuce and tomato.
I've wondered since then where this leaves the debate on healthcare. As doctors struggle to be stewards with our resources, will we face these conversations over and over with our patients? If a mother doubts even her doctor-daughter's desire to give her the best care, how can we expect patients not to question our motivations?

BALTIMORE — He’s got twice as many hits as he had at this point last season. Of course, that statistic is irrelevant since the Yankees have only played a half-dozen games.
