There are also wraps, and many of the items you'll find you could buy from street vendors in Lebanon, Khoury's birthplace. Let's start with the pies ($3-$4.25). These are 9-inch brick oven pies, the same size you'd get as a personal pizza in restaurants. I tried a three-cheese pie with fresh cheese from Cyprus, Bulgaria and Syria. The crispy browned and bubbly bite I promised myself turned into an entire slice. It is so good, so light and so robust, it's my new favorite lunch, although Khoury says it's a traditional Lebanese breakfast.

A little background here: As a child, Barnabas and his wealthy family sailed from England in 1750 and founded the fishing village of Collinsport in coastal Maine. They spent 15 years building the grand Collinwood Manor, where a maid named Angelique (Green) loved Barnabas passionately, but he never returned her affections. Because she felt scorned—and happened to be a witch—she turned him into a vampire, chained him up and stuck him in a coffin in the ground. Nearly 200 years later, a construction crew unearths him and sets him free.

The issues associated with a lack of a level two trauma center on the East Side are real and remain unresolved. The closure of the hospital and its emergency room exacerbates the problem. In fact, during the discussion regarding the level two trauma center, the Cleveland Clinic repeatedly pointed to the existing emergency department as a necessary component of the overall trauma care in the region. Should the closure stand, not only would we be faced with where to send 800 trauma patients, we would face the additional dilemma of where to send 2,200 other emergency patients.

A-: The first four picks have been starters in the NFL for the past three years and have all made significant contributions to the team. The most questionable pick was Williams, who was taken higher than most had him being selected and has been a disappointment. (Pro Bowler Mike Wallace was the next receiver taken, two picks later.) Hill was a quality pick in the fourth round and has played in 44 games in three seasons. Follett was solid on special teams before a neck injury derailed his career.

The reasoning runs something like this: A budget's initial battles -- battles the "first-acting chamber" fights -- are the fiercest. Settling them requires the biggest compromises. That means the House, the first-acting chamber, arguably has more to lose, in terms of wasted effort, if the Senate balks at the House's own budget amendments. That is, what amendments the Senate writes, the House may let senators have -- after, that is, lobbyists tell senators which amendments to demand.

There are different levels of competition, however. With NFL rosters expanded to 90 this offseason, yes, the Eagles were going to add a fourth quarterback. It could have been a seventh-rounder or an undrafted free agent. By taking Foles 88th overall out of Arizona, Howie Roseman and Andy Reid pretty much ensured that Foles will be on the team this year, barring serious injury. We know Michael Vick is the starter, again barring serious injury. That leaves Edwards, the 28-year-old former Bills starter, fighting it out with Mike Kafka, a third-year player coaches seem to like a lot. After the draft, Reid praised Kafka’s diligence, recounting how the QB often pokes his head into the coach’s office after voluntary late-night film study.

øMy mom was the first coach I had when I was a little girl so I'm kind of used to it. On the track I don't look at her as a mom. She's my coach, I know she knows what she's doing, so it makes it easier for me to treat her like a coach. I don't want to be treated as a daughter.

When I served as Ohio attorney general, I was regularly faced with the dilemma of whether to defend a law that I would have voted against. Time and again, I was reminded that a central tenant of the rule of law has been to insulate legal decisions from political ideology and pressures. In fact, one of the great developments in the history of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence was the notion that courts of law and those charged with enforcing the law ought to make decisions without regard to the social status or political power of the litigants or their own political ideology.

But to maximize the 36-year-old Manning's limited time, they need immediate production from early-round picks. Defensive tackle appears to be the biggest need -- as it was last year -- but the Broncos completely bypassed the position in the 2011 draft and will do so again if they don't like the quality and value presented when they select. The need for immediate production could spur the Broncos to deal a future first-rounder in order to trade up from the 25th pick.

Although I love to make the most of my food dollars, I don't want to economize and find out later that I have sacrificed flavor. When it comes to Italian grating cheeses, I linger over the counter, trying to decide. Grana Padano is much less expensive than Parmigiano-Reggiano, especially if the latter is aged more than 24 months.

If that sounds abstract, let's allow PNCA to further detail what the prize entails: "In a 1000-word essay, applicants are asked to consider the fact that many developments of the 21st century such as rice infused with human DNA, new forms of warfare, fully playable nanoguitars, bots traversing blood streams, or transistors the size of viruses, are largely invisible and, as such, resistant to critique and intervention-what we call politics as a system of challenge, contestation, and negotiation. How do we force invisible processes into visibility, and what do we do with them once they appear at this threshold? Conversely, what are the means by which the visible might be made to disappear? Are these the right questions?"

The multicultural phenom, born of Argentinean parents in Sweden, reportedly bristled when first told that he sounded like Drake, an icon of British folk on a par with the late Sandy Denny and the enduring Richard Thompson. But once he heard the 1994 compilation, Way to Blue: An Introduction to Nick Drake, he was captivated.

Her 1993 best-seller, “Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Son’s First Year,” set the standard, acknowledging the doubts and the difficulties, the sense that many first-time parents have of being cast into an alternate universe where simply taking a shower and getting dressed in clean clothes is a moral victory over the chaos and entropy that every infant leaves in his or her wake.

The Guardian in London included a note from a correspondent in Pakistan that seemed to sum up the stunned confusion of the announcement:
While their status as viral video and TV stars may be recent, On the Rocks isn't new. As the group's website recounts, it all started in the summer of 1999 when two students, Leonardo Silva and Peter Hollens, met in a University of Oregon writing class. A shared love of singing inspired them to start a vocal group, which grew into On the Rocks. Since then, the group has thrived, with a typical lineup of nine to 12 members, who must be UO students. Auditions are held in the fall and spring to add new members to replace those who graduate out of the group.

Q: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently threw out a law which made it a crime for people to wear military medals that they hadn't earned. A lot of folks in this community think that's an outrageous affront to the veterans who really served and they don't understand the logic of the judge who said there's no evidence that falsely wearing medals is injurious to someone and should be seen as a crime. Is that something you have an opinion on?

Seldom does a film convey as stark and riveting a vision as the one that unfolds in "Children of Men," a dystopian drama starring Clive Owen and directed by Alfonso Cuarón. (The cinematographer was Emmanuel Lubezki, and the production was designed, brilliantly, by Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland.) And seldom are the director, his actors and their audience sandbagged by a script of such ineptitude.

The election was a mixed bag for the mayor in other ways. His ally, City Councilman Jack Weiss, was forced into a runoff in the race for city attorney. His push for the solar energy plan known as Measure B stumbled despite a flood of 30-second television commercials that featured the mayor as the sole salesman.

NEW YORK - A lawsuit filed against the Recording Academy over its decision to trim the Grammy Award categories from 109 to 78 has been dismissed.
The pacing, a little slow, also hints at the show's age, and numbers like Rose's "Shriner's Ballet" seem positively antique in their weird combination of sex and willful naiveté. (What are she and those Shriners supposed to be doing under that table?) The status of women, who according to Kim want to do nothing but "pick out a boy and train him," has changed drastically since "Bye Bye Birdie" won its Tony awards. Nowadays Rose wouldn't put up with Albert's shilly-shallying or his mother's racist digs; she'd open a music agency of her own.
The fans' excitement is likely to increase with the arrival of Cooper. The Timbers have hyped Cooper as one of the final pieces to the team puzzle, a catalyst for their attacking style and - they hope - goal scoring. The Timbers signed Cooper for one primary reason: Goals. And Spencer hopes he is getting the Kenny Cooper that played for FC Dallas for four seasons. That version of Cooper scored goals at a prolific rate - 40 goals in 90 games. Cooper scored 18 goals and was selected to the MLS Best XI (all-league) and an All-Star during the 2008 season.

The only things moving on the flat, calm waters of Lake Isabella are the red-eyed Western grebes, hunting carp and other small fish off the shores of Paradise Cove. I take this as a sign of bigger fish. It's midmorning, and several other anglers have already staked out the bare, rocky shores of the cove. There are no trees to break up the landscape or provide shade, and anglers can park right up on the shores of the lake. A few yards away, a fisherman sits in the bed of his pickup and stares at his line in the water, as if in a trance. Just beyond him, a second angler sits in the front seat of his pickup, his pole held up by a prop, smoking a cigarette, also contemplating the shimmering surface. What are they thinking about? The fleeting nature of life? Reincarnation? The existence of God? That's when I get a tug on my line, and I think about the best way to grill a trout.

Although this is the same Steve Martin who both wrote and starred in "The Jerk" and "The Jerk, Too," he certainly seems more rarefied here. One doesn’t find Pablo Picasso, Albert Einstein, or anyone like them in Martin’s standard-fare Hollywood films. The geniuses’ radical theories allow Martin to dispense a radical kind of comedy — think of this as the play Neil Simon would have written, if he had been a Mensa member.

The budget division's proposals merely buy the city time to consider an even more fundamental restructuring of a Fire Department that serves a much smaller city than it did 20 years ago. The department now serves as the city's emergency medical responder, but fights roughly half the fires it fought 20 years ago. Ms. Green deserves credit for trying to ease the pain of the first steps of major change that has been deferred for a long time and that is needed urgently.
Then Michael Brantley opened the ninth inning with single. He stole second, but Asdrubal Cabrera struck out. No matter, Travis Hafner, the reborn version of Pronk, doubled to left center to score Brantley and tie the game.

A few hundred yards away, the Intinan Solar Museum claims to be the exact GPS measurement-confirmed equator, and it's really the most fun. Visitors get to participate in science experiments showing how to balance an egg on its end at the tip of a nail on the equator line. Similarly, you can do the sink test. If the little sink is exactly on the equator, the water goes straight down. If it is moved north of the equator, the water swirls counter-clockwise, just like water in your toilet at home. If the sink is moved south of the equator, the water swirls clockwise. The difference? The rotation of the earth and its magnetic pull, the guide says.

Complicating matters were the damaged sewers, which prompted civil authorities to prohibit the use of bathrooms in houses for several days.

Nugent's apparent advice to American citizens whose political favorite has lost an election would be to respond with the level of violence required to make them liable for death or imprisonment. His desired form of democracy sounds more like anarchy to me, and even if Nugent lacks the courage to act out his anarchist prescription, his words alone may provoke violent actions by those even less rational than himself.

Let's be clear: That stuff can sometimes work, and not just in the movies.

Unlike the two previous versions of the bill, this one specifically exempts Homeland Security's list of "crucial components" from judicial review.

It’s certainly a natural desire to help relatives in need and take care of future generations. But use extreme caution when giving out your money. Jack Whittaker, a West Virginia contractor who won a nearly $315 million Powerball jackpot in 2002, quickly fell victim to scandals, lawsuits and personal setbacks. His foundation spent $23 million building two churches, and he’s been involved in hundreds of legal actions. “If you win, just don’t give any money away, because the more money you give away, the more they want you to give. And once you start giving it away, everybody will label you an easy touch and be right there after you. And that includes everybody,” Whittaker said five years ago.
