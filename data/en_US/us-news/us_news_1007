PACIFIC TREE FROGS: In Oregon, spring sounds like a loud, two-part kreck-ek or reb-it -- or at least it does if you've got Pacific tree frogs in the neighborhood. The 2-inch long frogs crank up the volume in spring, with males croaking vociferously and repeatedly aiming to attract females. When one frog starts the chorus, he stimulates other males to follow and their song fills the air.
Uptown Alley developer Steve Uphoff said he and his investors saw an underserved market in Surprise and plenty of potential patrons for a large entertainment complex.

In Old Bridge, Kenneth Popovich, principal of the township’s Carl Sandburg Middle School, said he likes the uniform idea because it would take pressure off of parents and school officials who have to reprimand students if they are dressed too provocatively. Old Bridge school board member Abhishek Desai said uniforms could be up to 75 percent cheaper than the clothes most students wear now. But he acknowledged the policy could stifle self-expression.
"It doesn't matter to me whether they're high school or junior college,'' Graham said. "We're looking for the best and brightest, guys with the best character, so we'll take them from all walks.

Much as Smith's 879 career wins and two national titles with the Tar Heels, innumerable innovations and influences on the game and broadly admired humanitarian acts have chiseled him in the Mount Rushmore of college basketball coaching, he is something more when it comes to two of the game's most storied programs.

It was Haile's idea that Delamarter ask Weiner to give the book to a new museum planned in Ankober, Ethiopia, to be dedicated to Menilek. Delamarter had never made such a request of a book owner, he says. He'd been content to create digital copies and preserve the contents for the use of students and scholars.

Two of the Kings' four children, Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Bernice King, attended Monday's ceremony. Their brother, Dexter King, was unable to attend the service because he is recovering from injuries he received in a car crash last year. Yolanda King, the eldest of the King siblings, died in 2007. Bernice King is also president-elect of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which her father co-founded in 1957.
After the first Kings goal, Perron put the Kings right back on the power play at the end of the first period with a needless goaltender interference penalty. He made a great play to steal the puck on the forecheck and he muscled a good shot on goal while fighting off a check. But his collision with Quick was avoidable.

The patient wears the patches for 48 hours and returns to the office near day three and day seven of the test. This is because the reaction taking place between the skin and allergen is delayed, meaning it will take the skin time to show visible signs of an allergy.

“I was a member at Cohanzick from 1978-96 and you had to fight and steal to get on there,” said Nugent. “It was mainly doctors and lawyers at the time, and I got in thanks to a doctor.

That trait has been the Devils’ downfall all season. Yesterday, they only blew a one-goal lead. They blew three- and two-goal leads in the first round, and how does anyone survive that?
True, some of this is down to bad luck rather than bad judgment. The BOE couldn't have been expected to predict last year's escalation in the euro crisis or the Arab Spring. But the BOE must take the blame for grossly over-estimating the impact of sterling's devaluation. It has also badly under-estimated the weakness of the money supply: Despite pumping £325 billion ($523.98 billion) into the economy, equivalent to 20% of GDP, the U.K. broad money supply suffered its biggest quarterly drop in February since records began in 1963. Add the BOE's failure to predict the crisis—even in May 2008 it was still attaching a virtual zero probability of a recession—and it is clear something is wrong with its models.

The solution: Make your own veggie tray for less than $10. The biggest expense is the dip so swap it for a veggie or garlic hummus which costs between $2.99 and $3.99 for a 7-ounce tub. For the veggies, pre-sliced bags of baby carrots and celery are ready to serve and cost 99 cents each. Avoid combo-packs of cut vegetables because the convenience can add another dollar. Finally, include pita chips ($2.79 a bag) or Italian rolls ($3.29 a bag) cut into 1-inch slices.

It whittles down Ohio's 18 current congressional districts to 16 by pitting a pair of Democrats and a pair of Republicans against one another in two different districts.

Mark Lenard plays the Bolts' competitor Stempel, who is kind of a villain, but not really. When he does something unkind, he wears an "I don't mean it" smirk. ("Star Trek" nerds remember Lenard as Mr. Spock's papa.) Henry Beckman risks the ire of Irish-American anti-defamation groups with his blustery Captain Clancey, who is always ready to hoist some ale and dance a jig.
Today, the Free Press separates the swirling exaggerations from the truth in the border showdown critical to Michigan's future.
We feel fortunate to have put some of these practices in place. We often hear about the skills gap and employers not being able to find folks. What we would say is try us. We want to have the most robust, deepest and pre-screened talent bank in the county; so that when a employer thinks about hiring someone, we'll be the first one they call. We're free. We have these people who are active. We can access them quickly; and we can get them over to the employer quickly. It saves a cost to them; It gives the job seeker more opportunity; and it is a very valuable service.

Program manager Ann Colonna said large companies view Portland as a trendy place -- approval by foodies here may mean success elsewhere for new flavors or modified products. They pay about $10,000 for access to Colonna's database of 14,000 local taste testers. Colonna conducts taste tests using demographics to select targeted consumers. In addition, a focus group meeting room has one-way glass so company officials can hear and see what consumers think of their product.

What Sowell's defense team or prosecutors could hope to learn from the Jackson family is unclear. What is clear is that the mayor has already learned plenty from the Sowell saga. It was Jackson, after-all, who appointed a special commission to study police procedures and the department's relationship with the community shortly after Sowell's arrest. Jackson followed that up with the creation of a six-person committee tasked with tracking the city's progress in improving police response to missing persons reports or sex crimes cases.

Just like I predicted, Proposition C (in Mehlville School District) was defeated because, like I said, all Republicans vote against tax increases, and that's why I am a Republican. I believe there should never be a tax increase. I don't care what it's for. That's what we believe in, no tax increase. That's what we say. And because I'm single, I'm 50-something years old, never had kids, these people need to think about having kids. They don't need them, they don't know how to take care of them. I take care of myself, all my cars, motorcycles, boats, my houses everything, that's what I think about. So, that's the way it is. ...

Novick is best known for his eclectic pursuit of justice, whether in taking on the Oregon Lottery Commission to collect more money for schools, challenging U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith in 2008 or repeatedly exposing the holes in Bill Sizemore's various initiatives. In some ways, Congress is a better fit for Novick than the Portland City Council, considering his wide-ranging interests and his tendency to focus nationally. It's easy to picture Novick getting restless during discussions of, say, off-leash dog areas.

The other top scorer was Sara Lee Deep Dish ($8.49 for a 2-pound, 15-ounce pie, Safeway). Its label says "crust made with real butter" but the ingredient list shows that the main fat in the crust is shortening, a longtime crust staple that's recently hit the skids because it contains trans fat - 5 grams per serving, in this case. This pie has many more ingredients, including preservatives and artificial flavor.

But for many Band admirers, that honor belonged to the short, feisty Helm, whose authoritative twang once was likened to a town crier calling a meeting to order. He not only sang Dixie Down, he inhabited it, becoming the Confederate Virgil Caine, hungry, just barely alive, his brother killed by the Yankees, the South itself in ruins. It was the kind of heartbreaking, complicated story and performance that had even Northerners rooting for the proud and desperate Virgil.

Matt Calkins: In response to charges that he was a shoot-first player with no regards to team success or defense, Jamal Crawford said last Friday that "a story could come out that I work at Voodoo Doughnut and everyone would believe it."

Five years later, Funny or Die, which McKay, Ferrell and "Entourage"executive producer Chris Henchy founded on a whim (and with the friendly urging of a venture capital firm), is way beyond baby steps. You might say, to keep the metaphor going, it already has graduated and become a media mogul: This fall there will be four Funny or Die-branded TV shows, two Web series and a movie in production, said CEO Dick Glover. It recently launched an iPad magazine, announced a deal to provide some of the in-flight entertainment for Virgin Airlines and started a commercial division. It's become the place where stars and corporations alike go to seem a little subversive. "The Landlord," the most-watched video in FoD history, has been viewed more than 80 million times, and the site gets 17 million visitors a month. Glover, who said Funny or Die became profitable in late 2010, has not ruled out the possibility ("someday, just not right now") of an initial public offering for Funny or Die stock.
This is just another artificial stimulus at our expense. If the president had allowed the housing market to bottom out naturally, it would have already happened a long time ago, and we'd be rebounding. As it stands, we're still walking the housing market down, cushioning its fall with our tax dollars.

The custom led to a little-noticed but farcical episode in July 2003, when Communications Director Dan Bartlett held a White House briefing to defend the now-discredited national intelligence estimate of October 2002, which claimed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Throughout, the transcript refers to Bartlett as a "senior administration official," and news stories on the briefing duly credited a "senior administration official" or "White House officials." Four days later, Bartlett held another briefing on the same topic, in which he referred to several matters "I talked about last Friday." Inadvertently or not, Bartlett thereby revealed he was the same faceless official who had presided over the earlier briefing.

For Day 102, I did a treadmill while watching a few of the latter innings of the Indians' game. I jogged for eight minutes -- the first time I have jogged in two-plus months. A strained muscle in my back, then a pulled quad, kept me on the sideline. Thanks largely to the amazing work of massotherapist Karen Chorba, I have made tremendous progress on both fronts. I cannot imagine where I would be without Karen, whom I have known for years and who has helped expedite my healing from more than a couple of injuries.

Under the plea deal described in the media reports, Urdangarin would agree to plead guilty on condition prosecutors not seek a jail term of more than two years. The length of any sentence is key because first-time offenders in Spain - Urdangarin has no criminal record - who are convicted of a crime and sentenced to two years or less automatically receive a suspended sentence. So Urdangarin would not go to jail.
Consumers weren't always so keen to orange, however, said Eiseman, who wrote the new book "Pantone: The 20th Century in Color." It's been used a lot in high fashion -- think Versace and Hermes -- for years, but to the general public, especially in the United States, it was more closely associated with fast food or children's products, she explained. It all started to change as computers opened many doors in the 1990s.

"The E Street Shuffle"'
To minimize the temptation for employers to wait until a worker has been out of work for six months, we should make the amount the federal government will provide proportionate to the amount of time the employee has been out of work, sliding from, say, 10 percent of salary for an employee out of work at just six months up to the maximum of 50 percent at, say, a year out of work. To prevent dropping a current worker to hire a long-term unemployed worker at half the cost, the employer would have to refrain from laying off workers during the time it received the subsidy for the new workers, and a reasonable time beforehand. These conditions would actually lower the overall cost of the proposal.

I was trying to think of a strong historical analogy for President Barack Obama's sudden embrace of gay marriage this week, and the best I could come up with (thanks to my colleagues on the Free Press editorial board) was 1939, when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for singer Marian Anderson to perform on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. That was after the Daughters of the American Revolution had prevented the renowned Anderson, who was African American, from singing for an integrated audience at Constitution Hall.

Rudd rises to the occasion, and then some. After the cramped quarters in New York, George is delighted with the elbow room of Elysium, as well as the flirty glances of Eva (Malin Akerman). The pretty blonde reminds him that at no-rules Elysium, the one rule is free love. The (obviously improvised) sequence in which George rehearses before the mirror how he will seduce Eva reduced me to a puddle of giggle.
The behavior: Sowell often showed signs of disinterest in the proceedings -- yawning, stretching, resting his chin on his hand -- right up until the jury delivered its verdict. But as Common Pleas Judge Dick Ambrose began reading the guilty judgments on 82 counts, Sowell's facial expression hardened, his eyes blinked rapidly and his breathing accelerated. When Ambrose finished and asked Sowell if he understood his right to an appeal, Sowell would not turn to face the judge and only mumbled an answer after prompted a second time.
