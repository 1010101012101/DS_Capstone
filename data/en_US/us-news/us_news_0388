Heidi tells Mondo she loved the screenprinted shirt with a skull design detail; and a color-blocked tunic with leggings. Nina loved the mix of prints on the first outfit but thought it was, all in all, "too overwhelming." Jessica says it didn't look like anybody but Mondo would have designed it. Michael thinks it's too costume-y. And he's not happy to see the polka-dot dress again. Not happy at all.

The images allegedly were sent from Berthold's computer and e-mail address.
Jagger and Marley dominate the vocals on the dozen-song disc, but even so the record is never far from collaboration. The song “One Day One Night” is a great example written by the entire ensemble. It opens with Jagger singing about being in a “rotten cheap hotel with a stale old smell” drinking himself into a stupor. He then yields the mike to Marley, who sings in clipped reggae vocals about the personal hell of getting stuck in a dark room with “one spliff and an empty box of matches.” Mick rocks, Damian skanks and Joss Stone caps the tune off with a frenzy of feral soul.

To see a team go from crisis to champions, from fire-the-coach to plan-the-parade, is unusual. To see a team do it twice, in a span of four years, might be unprecedented.
Minsky's 5th Louisiana Levee District is plagued these days by "sand boils," places where river water has found a way through earthen levees and bubbled up on the dry side like an artesian well. He insists they are no reason for alarm. If the water is clear, as it has been so far, that means the levee is not eroding. Stopping the boil involves ringing it with sandbags.
Maybe we’ll have more luck with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, who’s scheduled to visit Washington next month. More likely, Beijing will continue to buy Iranian oil. Other powers — Turkey, Japan, South Korea, India — will almost surely then say that, yes, their interests coincide with ours, but no, their economies would suffer too much. If China is exempt, why not them?

The reason why USA Payday Forever started this new social media campaign, according to them, is that their cash advance customers had been contacting them to give them critical feedback about their services. Many had claimed that they needed more than just help getting cash advance loans. They didn't want to get stuck in perpetual debt from not knowing how to properly handle their finances. Thus, USA Payday Forever and their unnamed personal finance partner company came up with the idea of the social media campaign.

The rehabbed Jimmie's Saloon space in the Princeton Heights neighborhood is charming and tidy, with lots of rustic brick and shiny wood.

Surrounded by a few well-edited and suggestive elements, Miller—blond and blue-eyed, and boyishly handsome—sits smack in the center of the store at a simple table. (He prefers to handle sales himself, and when he must be out of town, he calls his father to step in.) Walk into the store in the early-morning hours and chances are Miller will be there, sipping a coffee and poring over books of fabric suiting.

The Dutch 10-year bond was at 2.43% late Monday, from 2.33% on Friday, according to Tradeweb. The country's borrowing costs remain low, however, and the Netherlands is in no danger of losing access to capital markets, economists say.

� Scrooge: A tightwad of magnificently penurious proportions, Scrooge shared nothing, particularly his love. He ignored his one relative (nephew Fred) and seemed ambivalent at best toward his lifelong business partner, Jacob Marley (remaining so even as the Marley's ghost, dripping in chains, appeared - Scrooge blaming the vision on something he ate, concluding that Marley was more foul fig than figment.) Scrooge detested everything that did not involve quality time with his money.

For Robinson, knowing that he is providing some joy and comfort to hospice patients is rewarding.
All of this sounds like a pretty decent fate for a writer. I haven't written a book, although I'd like to. And that's one way in which sharing a birthday with Chandler is problematic. He was visionary in his characterizations, dead-on in his take on Los Angeles and wrote brilliant prose. What would it take to be that good?

There is a certain jolt of pride in knowing that attitudes have sufficiently changed so no female sports reporters will ever need to pose as a "pert young miss" with the track team and that bosses can no longer consider a pat on a secretary's derriere a job perk. And that future doctors are now heading to hospitals where their grandmothers could do little more than clean rooms and empty bedpans.

"After the 2008 election, the reality is the pick is going to be evaluated on one criteria: Is that person who [Romney] picks prepared to be president from the moment of the inauguration, and do Republicans, Democrats and the media all agree that that person is unquestionably prepared to be president in the way that Joe Biden was or Dick Cheney was," said former McCain strategist Steve Schmidt.

Bento boxes, available for lunch, are a great way to sample a variety of Japanese fare for one price. My wife had a Teriyaki Chicken box ($9.95) and I had Nigiri Sushi ($10.95). The boxes come with a lettuce salad with zesty, fruity dressing, a bowl of miso soup, an appetizer and California sushi rolls. The moist, tender teriyaki chicken was easily the best of the hot dishes we sampled. And I would be perfectly happy to eat a whole plate of the impeccable bluefin tuna sushi that was included in my combo.

Part of the exhibit designers' goal, he said, was to show how many animals and plants co-exist with people in a developed region. He said the designers' goal was to have people use the building as a starting point to learn about nature and then head outdoors to tour the trails and other areas. "I like to think this is a new paradigm for what nature centers can be," he said.
The idea, he says, is to "bring them here and say, 'Look at this community — what's interesting to you about this community? It's your resource; you tell me how you want to use it.'" The residency currently underway, with Los Angeles artist Jules Rochielle, involves the organization of a "think tank" of artists to investigate topics of work, labor, food and immigration; another currently in discussion, by the Venezuelan-born artist Saskia Jordá, would entail collaboration with the many nearby quinceañera shops.
At this rate, if he makes 30 starts - his average since 2001 is 32 - he'd reach 202 innings. Halfway to having his option vested. The Giants could manipulate his innings count to ensure he's not vested, but suddenly, 200 innings isn't a ridiculous thought.

White sesame pot de creme, however, was excellent and banished the nouvelle presentations for a simple bowl with stewed cherries and a cookie on top. Other desserts, including the vanilla bean gelato with pineapple and olive oil, and the warm beignets with blueberries, lemon thyme and ras al hanout sorbet, sounded more interesting than they tasted.

In 2010, New Jersey legislators introduced the Christopher Bryski Student Loan Protection Act, which would require lenders to explain a co-signer's obligations should the borrower die.

The children were nursed between three and nine years, with half being weaned between ages 3 and 4. The mothers tended to be middle- and upper-class women, the majority of whom were highly educated and worked outside of the home.

It decided to consolidate its wafering and cell manufacturing in Oregon after that state offered incentives, such as property tax abatement and business energy tax credits, said Bob Beisner, a company vice president. SolarWorld will employ 1,000 in Oregon by 2011. It will also keep some jobs in California.

"You can make more money on average if you go to college, but it's not true for everybody," says Harvard economist Richard Freeman, noting the growing risk of a debt bubble with total U.S. student loan debt surpassing $1 trillion. "If you're not sure what you're going to be doing, it probably bodes well to take some job, if you can get one, and get a sense first of what you want from college."
He and Penny, though, overcame their differences. "We're family," he said. "We worked it out. That was a long time ago. We got through it."
Don't overload chicken stock with vegetables if you want the result to taste like chicken. Peel carrots and onions, and discard celery leaves, which have a strong flavor. Schwertner uses only the white parts of leeks, not the strappy green tops, arguing that the tops make the stock too vegetal. But she might save the tops, blanch them separately in water, and float them in chicken soup.
• Chris Foster, LA Times: Rick Neuheisel says UCLA has made 'lots of progress': "Well, in my mind, from my vantage point, there has been lots of progress," Neuheisel said. "I understand the frustration of the fans out there. They may not be able to see it because they don't come to all the practices and they don't sit where I sit." Where Neuheisel sits, at the moment, is second in the city. UCLA has lost 11 of the last 12 games to USC, including the last three under Neuheisel, heading into Saturday's game at the Coliseum.

This was a great day for the Indiana Pacers. They got their first enshrinee (Mel Daniels, who was previously announced in February) and their second (Miller) in the same class. They got recognized for their ABA past (Daniels) and their NBA near-past (Miller). And yes, it's ridiculous that Daniels was the first full-time ABA player to get enshrined; several other ABA players are already in, but they were transitional players, having done some of their work in the ABA and some in the NBA. Daniels was ABA from start to finish.

For the first time in a few years, nobody can blame Oregon. And I don't think you can fault Robinson at Oregon State, either. Oregon's been very good at playing with the lead dogs on a given night. And as the Beavers demonstrated in whisking out to a double-digit lead against the Huskies, then clinging to it in the final seconds as the Huskies clanged free-throw attempts, the conference is a pile of mush.

Modern medicine has changed all that. As we learn more, and can do more, diseases which used to be acute and rapidly fatal -- cancer, heart attacks, even HIV -- have become chronic.

Moreover, chronically ill people are at risk for predictable, expensive complications: people with diabetes sometimes develop kidney failure; cancer may recur.

A: I don't find anything hard about it. I'm just working with the things that I know and bringing my little capitalist self into this environment. I think it gives me the opportunity to lend some skills that don't necessarily live in a nonprofit environment.
The question about this State of the Union, then, becomes not how well the president laid out a course of action for the remainder of this term but how well he articulated his case for getting a second. Much remains to be said before voters go to the polls, but the president effectively articulated the differences between his vision for the nation and his opponents'. He called for an America in which the wealthiest pay their fair share, the middle class have a fair shot at getting ahead, and the poor can get help climbing up the economic ladder. If the GOP wants to challenge that in a week in which one of their leading contenders for president revealed that he made $21 million last year and paid less than 15 percent in federal taxes, they can go right ahead.

Getting back to the problems with Seton Hall's 3-point shooting, perhaps the Pirates were feeling a bit overconfident after their showing against Northwestern. In the title game, Seton Hall shot 10-of-23 from behind the arc — its best showing of the season. Tuesday night's 2-for-16 black eye was made even worse by the fact that the only two players who made a trey were Patrik Auda and Grennan. ... There were three stats which helped tilt the game heavily in Seton Hall's direction: Points off turnovers, points in the paint and fast-break points. Off turnovers, the Pirates outscored Yale, 25-16; In the paint, it was worse — a 42-18 advantage. And in transition, Seton Hall really flexed its muscle, beating Yale 20-2. ... The Pirates now lead their series against Yale, 3-1. Tuesday night's meeting was the first since 1943.

I'm not sure why this Jersey-born blonde chick from South Carolina sounds Jamaican sometimes. And that part was kind of weird -- "Why don't we stay together" as a chick who'd gotten stoned to "Legend" one too many times would do it.

Everyone was focused on the film, glued to the characters' interactions as if their lives depended on this, too. We all wanted to see whether the film lived up to our high standards.

Let me just offer another, more valid, theory. Since, the 1970s it all started to go downhill with regard to the cities' infrastructure because of the failures of bureaucrats. Among these failures are the sewer systems in the major metropolises around the Chesapeake Bay. The result from the billions of gallons of human waste that is allowed to "overflow" into the bay due to the failure of the system has caused the ill-health of our treasured Chesapeake, and not because of farmers or chicken growers, the ones who normally get blamed. When and if the writer finally acknowledges this fact, instead of blaming citizens, I will expect him to conclude he is still correct in his notion, basing it on the chemical makeup of human waste which is certainly caused from ingesting chemically laced junk food.

Season the beef liberally all over with salt and pepper. Heat a 12-inch skillet over high heat. Add the canola oil to the hot skillet. When the oil just begins to smoke, add the beef, fat side down. To avoid splattering yourself with hot oil, place the meat in the pan gradually, starting at the edge of the skillet closest to you and ending at the far edge. Sear the fat side until well browned, about 4 minutes, then turn and sear both ends of the meat and, lastly, the bottom. Transfer the meat to a plate and discard all the fat in the skillet. Let the skillet cool slightly, then wipe it out with paper towels. Return it to moderate heat and add the butter, garlic and thyme. When the butter melts and begins to foam, return the meat to the skillet and spoon some of the seasoned butter over it.

He doesn't need to work; the royalties from "The Serial Killer's Protégé" provide a more than comfortable living. When his publisher, Paul Sheppard, shows up at the door, David's first instinct is to turn him away.

The book would be a collection of David's existing crime writing but for one new story: David would solve the mystery of the death of the man from Primrose Lane.

Mairinger's schnitzel is as good as it gets in L.A., fried to a dark gold without a speck of grease. It comes in three versions: veal, pork or turkey.

The second thing is to not to try to plan too far ahead. There are so many variables in life that you may or may not ever get there. It's not that you can be aimless and unfocused, but I always say plan for the next thing that you want to do, and plan and do it well.

At the moment, they consist chiefly of a summation of each day's triumphant treatment of Child/French classics like Potage Parmentier, a rich, herb-laced potato soup, and a forecast of the next day's dish (Tuesdaynight: Fricassee de Poulet + L'Ancienne, also known as Chicken Fricassee with Wine-Flavored Cream Sauce, Onions and Mushrooms). But who knows?

2) UMBC’s man-up unit. Albany is middle-of-the-pack in killing extra-man opportunities, allowing opponents to score on 33.3 percent (18-of-54) of those chances. The Retrievers, who scored on 3-of-4 man-up situations on April 21, could use a similar effort from a unit that ranks 20th in Division I (39.3 percent on 22-of-56). “It’s always critical,” Zimmerman said. “If a team fouls you, you have to have your man-up unit come in and get a goal. It’s an opportunity to play six against five, which gives you the advantage, and you’re expected to take advantage of that opportunity. And when a team fouls and you don’t make them pay with a goal, that really allows them to continue to play aggressively, which is going to be an advantage for them.”

The question is about whether the nation's political system is capable at this point of making the difficult decisions necessary to reduce borrowing over the medium and long term. That's why the bond rating agency Standard & Poor's, for one, has indicated that the United States could face a costly downgrade even if it does avoid default next month. A temporary patch might well not be enough to convince the markets that the danger has passed.

Tibetans have nothing to offer to them, nor do they have people who can lobby for their cause. Let's be thankful that we can post comments or write what we think because we live in America. If we were in China, it would be a different story. Liu Xiabo, who co-authored Charter 08, a declaration calling for political reform, greater human rights and an end to one party-rule in China, was put in prison with an 11-year sentence. What was Liu's crime? Nothing but an expression of basic human rights that we all take as guaranteed.

Let me return now to the issue of same-sex marriage. (And I want to emphasize that the 12-page document devoted only three paragraphs to it.) The Catholic Church, like many others, opposes a redefinition of marriage. But the statement does not argue that point. Insofar as the subjects of marriage and religious liberty overlap, the issue is not whether gays can marry but whether the government should require religious dissenters to affirm and support such unions. The statement referred to:

Pitt (8-2) entered the game shooting a miserly 31.4 percent from behind the arc, but shot 60 percent on 3-pointers in the first half to fuel a 38-29 lead. The Panthers finished at 56.3 percent (9-of-16) on 3-pointers. Overall, Pitt shot 53.3 percent, but it was more a credit to the Panthers stepping up than to Kent's defense wearing down.

Jan. 7, 2008 / No. 2 LSU 38, No. 1 Ohio State 24: This game wasn’t actually the Sugar Bowl, which featured Georgia beating Hawaii, but it was the Buckeyes in New Orleans.

To create a gallery wall like the one here, hang photographs in varying of shapes and sizes in a grid that is pleasing to the eye. Plan the layout of your picture frames before hanging them on the wall or by arranging them on a workspace or floor. Smaller frames have more impact when grouped together; a large frame may stand alone. Place your frames at eye level, usually five feet from the floor. Hang them higher if your room has high ceilings.
Should the federal government compel religious institutions to provide goods and services that violate their most basic beliefs? That's the question.
Carlitos Gardel: The beef at this restaurant, owned by an Armenian family from Argentina, is mostly grass-fed and from Argentina. The cook in the family is Azniv Bozoghlian. Her son Gerard runs the dining room. Son Max is an expert in Argentine wines. Carlitos Gardel is a warm, old-fashioned place with white tablecloths, smart service and, on Saturday nights, a pianist playing old tangos. The food is elevated home cooking — mushroom caps stuffed with chicken forcemeat, deep-fried squid in marinara sauce and, of course, empanadas. But the real draw here is the steaks and especially the long, skinny skirt steak served with chimichurri. Bife (regular or mini) comes with a black peppercorn and mushroom sauce. Sometimes there's a 40-ounce rib-eye big enough to serve four. The other way to go is with the parrillada, or mixed grill, for two — skirt steak, short ribs, blood sausage with a hint of sweet spices, spicy Argentine-style chorizo and flattened sweetbreads, which are cooked until they're crispy at the edges. Do save room for one of Mrs. Bozoghlian's desserts, such as postre Gardel, a tall slab of genoise layered with peaches, dulce de leche and meringue. Or her ethereally light ricotta cake.

Alleged rape victim No. 2 She said Sowell raped her in October 2009. She said she met Sowell at bus stop and went to his home to smoke crack. She told him she was married and she had to leave. She returned to his house to get her identification. He grabbed her and ordered her to lay on bed. He raped her. As he went to close windows she jumped from a bedroom window that had not been shut.

He raises his hand. The woman eventually gets up and walks with him around the home.

On that first morning, we joined the other guests at the corral for our first two-hour ride. For each outing, the various wranglers lead a small group of six to eight riders. Some guests will only do walking rides, but others, like our group, want a faster pace. Since we were new arrivals, George Lorta, the head wrangler, matched us up with horses that we'd ride for our entire stay. Lorta keeps records of these pairings, so the four returning guests in our group - Kim, Jan, Cal and Sabrina - were asked if they wanted the same horses they had ridden the previous year. Three of them did; Jan opted to try a new mount.
Hopper earned his living early in his career by commercial illustration. He eventually came to revile it almost as a form of artistic slavery, but the need to be explicit that it forced upon him may have led him to the ambiguity characteristic of his mature vision.

Leon Chow, Avalos' challenger, not only will tap the Asian vote but also can claim some of the same strengths as Avalos. He counts on union support, but Chow, a longtime resident of the district, is a veteran labor organizer.

"To put it simply, the distress is well known," said AmTrust Financial attorney Stephen Lerner of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey. He noted that the bank is "significantly undercapitalized," which is akin to a household being nearly out of money.
2B JOE MORGAN: There are probably numbers and performances out there that make it possible to pick another player at second. I just didn't find them. Morgan won five Gold Gloves at the position, two MVPs, and was the engine behind the Big Red Machine. Yes, he's become a polarizing personality as a broadcaster, but should detract from his career anymore than Berra's charisma hides his. From 1975 to 1976, Morgan won his two MVPs with a batting li9ne of .324/.456/.541 and OPS of .997. Several of my friends have pointed out that some of the same measures that Morgan rails against on the air are the same that support his place as the greatest living second baseman. Other candidates: Roberto Alomar, Craig Biggio, Jeff Kent. Active candidates: Someday Chase Utley.

An outlier of sorts was John DiPompeo, 40, a former resident of Chatham and West Orange who moved to Florida but has roots in Indiana.

EDITOR'S NOTE: I stacked the question thinking I could pull one of our panelists over onto the Michael Floyd bandwagon. I understand Floyd had some alcohol-related issues in college, but that's not a scarlet letter that he'll have to wear or that will necessarily define his adult life ... and it's not exactly like the four pillars are still standing at Rams Park these days anyway. Bottom line: I think Floyd may have the more productive NFL career of these two players. And, given the concerns some have about him I believe the Rams could trade down a handful of spots, grab Floyd, and gobble up yet another additional second-round pick. Not sayin' I'm right, but, just sayin'.
