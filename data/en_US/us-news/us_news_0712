The soda bread baking started out as something he did for close friends and family. A few loaves translated into as much as a gallon of the recipe's key ingredient, buttermilk, will make.

As the age of anorexia has succeeded the age of anxiety — or perhaps simply compounded it — we've learned just how wrong the duchess really was. The actress Portia de Rossi came perilously close to being a casualty of that delusion, and her compellingly honest memoir, "Unbearable Lightness: A Story of Loss and Gain," is a candid account of the toll a tyrannical body image can exact. It's also a wonderfully fresh meditation on the daily pressures of a successful Hollywood career and what it means for an intelligent, but conflicted young woman to work out her identity in the unforgiving glare of celebrity.
But a reader asked -- and we agree -- that the numbers needed vetting. What's their documentation for the claim that "the plan could generate more than 50,000 jobs?" Turns out, we find the statement Mostly True.
The other guy is Danny Nichols. I got to work with him for awhile at Huntington Surf n Sport and really liked him a lot. Good kid. At that time he was a rising local surf star who had major skills.

Danny would be a perfect example of one of the really great surfers we have had that the general public would not know of but was super respected in the core surf community.

"Missouri, in my opinion the last five years has greatly over estimated that which we could take from the market in investment gains, thereby allowing employers to push down their true contribution rates," he said. "No one wants to talk about lowering cost of the benefit package, so you got to true up on the other side that pays for the benefit package. That's where I don't think Missouri has done a good job.

Cuyahoga County's new government now has a human face. Beginning in January, County Executive Ed FitzGerald and the County Council will shepherd the community's interests and investments for at least the next few years. Divisions over the nature of county reform and over the best individuals to fill the new roles will now, we hope, be set aside.

Their shoes, on the other hand, were just the right ones for their gaits, thanks to Trapp's guidance. She had advised them how to find the right shoes for running and also what to eat, and not eat, beforehand.

Every time some television talker babbles about "going for the gold," as if no other medal is worth having, I think about that game.

A half-century and more of oppression, including Soviet tanks rumbling through the streets of the Lithuanian capital only a year earlier, was the game's searing subtext.

Mr. Maxwell, this is Jim over in Cocoa Beach. I've been thinking about how all these legislators just do what the special interests want. So let me ask you something: If we got rid of all the legislators and their staffs, we'd be up a few million bucks, right?

Dr. Tae Beom Kim, a urologist at Gachon University in Incheon, Korea, and his colleagues studied 144 men over the age of 20 who were undergoing urological surgery for conditions that do not affect the length of the penis. One member of the team carefully measured the lengths of the index and ring fingers on the subject's right hand before surgery -- left hands are thought to be more variable. A second team member then measured penis length immediately after the subject had been anesthetized. The length was measured both when the penis was flaccid and when it had been stretched as much as possible. Stretched length is thought to correlate to erect length, the team wrote. The team found that, in general, the lower the ratio of the lengths of the two fingers, the longer the stretched length of the penis.

On the other extreme, there's Five Seas ($42), which I consider one of the best dishes of the year. It includes a tasting of five fish, each prepared differently but woven together with the flavor of ginger. The chef poaches ocean trout belly in ginger with a ginger crumble on top; he pan-roasts Japanese scallops; broils marinated black cod so the exterior is gooey and caramelized; coats rouget with tempura batter on one side, fries it and then pan sears the bottom; and slowly cooks tuna cheek for seven hours, slices it and braises the portion to order.

4. Brandon Weeden, Oklahoma State, 6-4, 218: This former minor league pitcher for the Yankees, Royals and Dodgers is 28. If he had played football from the start and came to the NFL at 22, he probably would have been in the first round discussion. Weeden has a good feel for the game, is smart and shows poise in the pocket. He makes good decisions and has been a winner. He has a fine arm and good athleticism. Weeden played in a spread system in college, but he looked good under center in the Senior Bowl.

On Saturday, Yuka Iino danced the dual roles of Odette and her evil double Odile with fragile lightness - with the wispy flightiness of her essential birdness (she and her flock are under a spell that dooms them to be swans by day and maidens by night) and the sadness of Odette's not-quite-human state. She's a better Odette than Odile - she underplays Odile's mad corrupting edge of allure - but in all other ways she's a joy to watch. Ronnie Underwood partners her handsomely as the rash and rather foolish Prince Siegfried, throwing himself convincingly into the role's broad Romantic gestures.

Israel would attack in the name of protecting its security, but at the end of the day, her security lies in peace — a peace derived from a comprehensive and just settlement with the Palestinians. If that is done, including return of most of the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war, then the chances of Israel living in peace with all her Islamic neighbors will be greatly improved. And further, such a peace settlement would take the wind out of the sails of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the mullahs in Iran. Their vitriolic tirades against Israel would likely diminish, but even if they continue, they would be unlikely to lead to attacks (nuclear or non-nuclear) on Israel.

The doctor, far from doing no harm, inflicts unspeakable psychic violence on the midwife, who has long been his mistress and knows the dark secrets of his domestic life. The pastor seeks to purify his own children with beatings, then rewards them with white ribbons to signify their supposed purification.

Surely, a few of the Secret Service agents had qualms when one of their buddies came up with the swell idea of calling in a troop of willing women in short, tight skirts for a night of booze and bunga-bunga at their hotel. Surely, one of them said, “Hey, guys, we’re on a mission representing the United States of America in a foreign land.

Simon said he rejected the first deal because he was worried about contract terms that called for 80 percent of the employment from Timken's plant expansion to come from active workers.

Meet the Trail Blazers' newest defensive weapon, an old weapon used from time to time the last couple of seasons that has been dusted off and polished for the stretch run.

Caggiano's restaurant on the corner of 28th Street and Capitol Avenue, named simply Biba, has long been considered one of the city's best, if not the best.

They'd have been upset all right. Adding something extra to a double-down bet is cheating just as surely as past posting in roulette - putting down a wager after the winning number is known - or trying to add chips to your main blackjack bet after seeing your cards.

Lange's book is not alone in looking at St. Louis and soccer. Another recent book on American soccer history, "Distant Corners" by David Wangerin (Temple University Press), provides a different - more critical, less pictorial - take on the early days of St. Louis soccer. The book looks at the country as a whole, but focuses one chapter on the often over-the-top physical nature of the St. Louis game and the insularity that may have doomed the sport here. Wangerin, a native Midwesterner who has lived in the United Kingdom for more than 20 years, also touches on some topics that Lange doesn't, such as the slightly dubious path Scullin Steel took to the 1921 Challenge Cup final.

I'm afraid I can't say the same for winner Catherine Zeta-Jones' star turn in "A Little Night Music," as her clumsily emphatic rendition of "Send in the Clowns" revealed on the telecast. Too bad Tony voters (those wooers of superstars who can't be expected to know what they're called) didn't get to see Hannah Waddingham's portrayal at the Menier Chocolate Factory's production in London, where Trevor Nunn's revival of this Stephen Sondheim-Hugh Wheeler classic originated.

That doesn't mean ignoring Native Americans. Genesis got off on a bad foot with them, but at this point, rather than dismissing the finds, it should be talking to the Colorado River Indian Tribes about how to resolve their objections. Government officials should be launching early talks with other tribes about energy projects planned for their areas. Tribal leaders should come up with reasonable proposals — in the case of the Genesis project, perhaps, a special space for the reburial of remains and artifacts and an independent archaeological team to ensure that important finds are treated carefully. But rerouting transmission lines which are not within the boundary of the bones, as some have suggested, is not acceptable. Nor is banning solar panels on large tracts or redesigning the project altogether. Our energy future is too important.

Sleeper Agent has little to hate about life right now. The band, six late-teen-to-early-20s kids from Bowling Green, Ky., is one of the lowest billed acts at Coachella (the festival ends Sunday).

My mother never allowed me to buy something in a store without getting a bag because she told me people will think I stole it if I walk out of a store without one. I never wanted to teach my son that lesson; I didn't think I needed to. Do brown bags make you look suspicious, or should I tell my 6-year-old to always ask for plastic? I think I will play it safe and purchase a green, reusable bag for him. Maybe if he appears to be interested in the environment, people will assume he is not a criminal. I don't believe a criminal would ever walk down the street with one of those reusable shopping bags, so that is probably the right choice. Yes, I think this is the safest, most politically correct option for him.

Although a Japanese-made Lexus already has a similar system, Ford's Mark Fields - who holds the grand title of "president of the Americas" - said Ford's "one-touch function will be much safer to use and less intimidating.
