Consumers should keep in mind that venue makes a difference to your wallet, says Christopher Parks, founder of change:healthcare, a company that is working to make prices more transparent to consumers. A few rules of thumb: Surgery, imaging and lab tests are generally less expensive at freestanding centers than in the hospital.

In “Black Ops,” the often predictable and cliche single player campaigns of “Modern Warfare” were ditched in favor of a historically-rooted but exciting tale that wasn’t just retreading territory that Tom Clancy has been covering for decades. While the weapons and technology of the 60s don’t pack the punch of “Modern Warfare”’s arsenal, the atmosphere made the game more than just a delivery device for an addictive online multiplayer game.

For most concerts at this mega-tent on the east bank of the Cuyahoga River, you'll be standing, not sitting. If you're near the front of the stage, be prepared for a tight squeeze, as well as the possibility of a mosh pit for hard-rocking acts. I prefer to chill a bit farther back, near the sound board. You'll not only find more breathing room, but the dude who oversees the sound mix is stationed here -- so your listening experience should be optimal. If you look over his shoulder, you might even sneak a peek at the set list. -- John Soeder, Plain Dealer Pop Music Critic

The remainder are facilities which have at least five alternative postal facilities nearby available to customers.

* The confused Sutter engaged in some baffling double-speak Sunday. On one hand he defended King's actions by saying it was just an arm (a shove) and not even a hit. Then Sudsy pivoted and suggested the the media was campaigning to take hitting out of the game. Huh? Sutter says King didn't hit Pietrangelo, so why the reference to hitting? Was it a hit or not, coach?
What should be done with PERS is open to reasonable debate. City Club's report proposes a package of reforms that would save employers and taxpayers significant dollars, but would still provide workers with excellent retirement benefits. But any reform, especially one that would reduce benefits to PERS members, must at least bolster the PERS system itself. The time for partial Band-Aid solutions, like eliminating "the pickup," has passed.

That's because, though new members are admitted every year, only death takes voting privileges away, so the composition of the just fewer than 6,000-member group changes very slowly, if it changes at all.

Some critics will no doubt argue that the FARC's interest in negotiations is merely a ploy to buy time, not a sincere attempt to end the bloodshed. And their skepticism is warranted. On the other hand, the FARC is hardly the same fighting force it was in the late 1990s, when it controlled vast swaths of the country. Colombia's military, with the help of U.S. aid and advisors, has dealt major blows to the rebels. Many of the FARC's longtime senior commanders have been killed or captured. And desertions have thinned its ranks.

"If they don't intend to implement the ordinance, why have it at all?" asked BJ Iacino of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless.
The purely symbolic nature of Anne Arundel's proposed law is revealed by the number of exemptions it grants to its own English-only standard. If passed, the measure would allow the county to continue publishing documents in foreign languages "to protect the rights of victims of crime and criminal defendants, to protect public health and safety, to teach English to non-native speakers and promote trade and tourism in the county." That sounds pretty much like exactly what the county is already doing. What else is there?
The book lists 198 nonviolent weapons for overthrowing dictators. It teaches seven basic lessons, the first of which is to plan a strategy. A major reason for the fizzling of the 1989 rebellion in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he asserts, is that it was improvised. The book, which can be downloaded free at aeinstein.org, is a crisp, practical instruction manual.

Friends of Jackson say he was taken aback by speculative reports that he might even be cut by the Rams if they drafted Richardson. Releasing Jackson makes no sense. The Rams do not need the salary cap room this year. Even before the restructuring of Jason Smith's contract last week saved the team $2.2 million in cap room, the Rams were projected to have enough money to sign their draft picks and still have a little bit of a cushion.

PolitiFact Ohio, a fact-checking feature of The Plain Dealer, found Mandel's fracking attack ridiculously false and labeled it "Pants on Fire."
Modern politics has become a vast Pavlovian experiment. New technologies and media outlets provide immediate positive and negative reinforcement. The blogs buzz, the ratings come in, the hits are counted. A public official who reads the press too closely finds a following in attacking it. Elements of the press find an audience in criticizing her relentlessly. Reflexes become conditioned. People salivate on cue.
The GOP leader said he doubts anyone will be talking about Senate Bill 5 come November 2012.

Chisenhall, 23, needed a good spring to make the Opening Day roster, as the Indians seemed to favor Jack Hannahan at third. Hannahan is a better defender, and hit .250 (.719 OPS) last season. But Chisenhall struggled, hitting .205 (.456 OPS) as he was 8-of-39 with one double and three RBI. He had 16 strikeouts compared to one walk.

“Ecosystems are driving purchases these days.” Gartenberg said.
The Yankees wanted to counter the expected attrition with pitching by having bountiful options, including Pineda, Phil Hughes, Ivan Nova, Manuel Banuelos and Dellin Betances. Aside from Nova, though, this has been a horror-show early season for this Yankees plan. Hughes has mostly been a mess. Banuelos pitched poorly and then ended up on the Triple-A DL (back), and Betances seems another version of Andrew Brackman — a big righty who cannot regulate his delivery as he had walked 17 in 17 1/3 innings this season.
North Korea formally walked away from the talks after the Security Council condemnation of its rocket launch.

Frey revealed that combined sewers present one major EPA concern. Combined sewers carry both stormwater and sanitary waste and account for 7 percent of all sewer lines in the Euclid system. Under dry conditions, all of the stormwater-sanitary waste mixture reaches the treatment plant. However, heavy rains outstrip the capacity of the trunk lines and the treatment facility, thus resulting in "bypass events," in Frey's words. With the system overwhelmed, the mixed waste "bypasses" the treatment facility and erupts from 10 sewage overflow tubes that empty directly into Euclid Creek and Lake Erie. Frey stated that "swirl" units screen out some of the waste, but added that not all overflows receive this "primary treatment." All such overflows, treated or not, are currently illegal, Frey noted.

Kaiser Family Foundation, said she didn't know how many employers would be affected, but said a recent Kaiser survey in California found that 6% of all employers and 11% of large employers reported that their health plans did not cover contraception.

Fly rods—whose look falls somewhere between a stick and long whip—aspire to an almost impossible combination of stiffness, flexibility and strength. A 15th-century German treatise shows how hard this was to achieve with natural materials: a slender blackthorn or medlar shoot was fixed to a tapering ash or willow stick after months of curing, drying and heating. By the 19th century, fishermen were using lancewood, bamboo and whalebone rods, soon joined by "greenheart" wood from a South American hardwood tree. Then came "split cane"—a bundle of slender fibers of bamboo, bound to make a whippy but strong rod—that dominated design until the 1970s, fighting off the challenge of glass fiber.

Against Miami, Ohio State could have called timeout, for instance, to set up the defense before a third-and-1 play with 7:02 to play, before a third-and-10 play with 4:52 left or before a first-and-goal play from the 6-yard line with 3:30 left, when Miami was rolling. Any of those calls also would have given the OSU defense a breather during a 14-play drive, though OSU defensive lineman John Simon said fatigue had nothing to do with allowing the final touchdown. For example, when the Buckeyes didn't call timeout with 4:52 left, Miami ran the clock down to 4:13 before snapping the ball on third down.

Back in 2006, McGuane told this reader that he was working on a novel about a "tremendously compassionate" man who was "in and out of disgrace." He had just come in from three hours of writing in his bunkhouse and seemed irrepressibly happy to have spent it in the company of Berl Pickett. His readers will feel the same way. Berl is 100% homemade from the ground up, with a moral compass that wasn't sold to him by a pharmaceutical company — or anyone else. "I had been raised to believe that time delivers our dreams and quietly carries our nightmares away, and that most of what lies ahead is welcoming and serene." That's Berl. Simple and optimistic. His parents traveled across the Great Plains cleaning carpets for a living before settling in Montana. His mother was a Pentecostal Christian, "always telling me how deceitful the devil was, but that only made me think I could handle him." His father "soldiered on at jobs he disliked." Like most good people, Berl gets in trouble easily, hurts people's feelings with his honesty and fails to care enough when the world threatens to take things away from him.

Sun Wah Two stars 5039 N. Broadway, 773-769-1254. Some of the best Chinese food in Chicago — and indisputably the city's finest Peking duck — can be found in the sprawling, 200-seat converted auto-repair shop that's the relatively new home to Sun Wah, formerly on Argyle Street. The large menu offers delights such as remarkably tender batter-fried scallops and a fine duck-scallop soup, but the best bets are found off the menu, from the daily specials scrawled on the glass divider near the host stand to the "hidden" dishes touted on the restaurant's Facebook page. Service and creature comforts are suspect, and the room is much too bright, but for food this good at such insanely low prices (Sun Wah even permits BYO, charging a mere $3 per bottle of wine), these are minor inconveniences. Order the Peking duck dinner ($32 and feeds four) when making reservations, or risk going without. Recommended: Peking duck dinner, Mike's Chicken, pork belly with asparagus. Open: Breakfast, lunch, dinner Friday-Wednesday, closed Thursday. Entree prices: $9.50-$16. Credit cards: M, V with $14 minimum. Reservations: Recommended weekends. Noise: Conversation-friendly. Other: Wheelchair accessible; BYO available.

The exhilaration of first love and the pain of its denouement burst forth with aching tenderness in "Like Crazy." Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin play Anna and Jacob, who meet when they're college students and fall in love after Anna boldly leaves a note on Jacob's windshield. "Like Crazy" then sends viewers along for the ecstatic ride as Anna and Jacob discover that they're soulmates, with director Drake Doremus telling the story as a collection of vagrant moments of connection and intimacy. That viewers can agonize right along with the protagonists can be chalked up to exquisite performances from Yelchin and Jones. "Like Crazy" seems to say, 'Haven't we all been there? Didn't it hurt? And wasn't it grand?' Contains sexual content and brief profanity. DVD extras: commentary by Doremus, editor Jonathan Alberts and cinematographer John Guleserian.

Some students, so I gather, don't pay up or take a long time to repay the college bills they have run up getting an education. So not only have they to face the problems my generation faced (marriage, children, a house, cars, etc.), but the looming burden of debts incurred by their education.

Since you changed to HDMI from another kind of digital connection, the first thing to do is to check the settings of your components. Make sure your cable/satellite box and DVD/Blu-ray player have HDMI audio set to transmit in surround, not stereo. This would be Dolby/PCM (not just PCM) on satellite and cable boxes. With Blu-ray players, it can differ depending on the player's capabilities, but selecting bitstream will always yield a surround-sound signal.
While I enjoyed the atmosphere, it was the eclectic sushi menu that made it stand out from other tried-and-true sushi spots. RA specials such as Mango Ceviche — lobster, scallop, shrimp, and mango salsa ceviche served over endive and avocado, finished with limes, cherry tomatoes and saut�ed pine and cashew nuts — and the Viva Las Vegas Roll — kani kama and cream cheese rolled rice and seaweed, lightly tempura battered and topped with spicy tuna, crab mix, and sliced lotus root, topped with eel sauce and spinach tempura flakes — really made the menu pop.

Uh-oh. When the new iPad was announced, I immediately had two concerns about the new ultra-high-definition display. Would quadrupling the number of pixels sorely tax the CPU and the battery? Indeed, iFixit's teardown of the new iPad's hardware locates the CPU in that very corner.

"I just sucked," Gallardo said after his role in the first of the two three-homer innings for the Cardinals this season. He did not, however, take all the credit for the Cardinals' hat trick. "They're tough. They have good hitters, up and down their lineup. They do it all. They have everything. They hit for power and average. They take advantage of mistakes. Balls I left up in the zone today, they take advantage of it."

Plaintiffs lawyers are already done questioning their final witness, UC-Davis psychology Professor Gregory Herek, who earns the distinction of being one of the quicker witnesses thus far (although cross-examination is just beginning, and that has tended to go for hours with the plaintiffs experts). Herek testified that research shows gays and lesbians do not choose their sexual identities, as same-sex marriage opponents suggest. And he also said they are subject to social stigma.
The fruit used in some of the desserts didn't seem to be at peak ripeness, either. Not only was the topping gummy on the crumble ($10), but the peaches were rock hard. A clafouti ($10) on another visit also didn't show off cherries to their best advantage. This dessert can be very cakelike or as rich and creamy as custard; the Press version tried to straddle both camps, and the resulting batter was soggy.

First, can you get comfortable with the idea that less might be better, or at least that what we have right now is pretty good? It took time, thought and effort to get to where we've come. Many want to convince us that living with less isn't an option, and they have been spending a lot of money, for a very long time, getting us to believe that's a fundamental truth. It's not easy to reorient ourselves around a new idea.

What a label fails to mention is that the sculpture once belonged to Cleveland lawyer and museum trustees president Harold Clark, who disliked it so much that he used it as a doorstop.
Great stuff from Hamani Stevens the other day. Seems like a really nice kid. Kinda shy, but pretty funny once you get him going. Stevens told me the craziest part of living in the Philippines for two years was eating Balut, a boiled, half-fertilized egg that is sort of considered a delicacy. My thought: Yikes. Stevens said he got used to eating it, but that he mostly survived off rice.

"The set, now designed by Kevin Depinet, has more solidity to it," he said. "All the action occurs in the bar, but the play is not sheer realism, so I wanted a shift in perspective as time passes. There's more of a dreamlike state and a psychological component - the same space, but seen through alcohol, in a waking state, and through the lurid colors of a hangover. The fourth act is more Beckettian." (And yes, there is a "Waiting for Godot" element in this play in which everyone is "Waiting for Hickey.")
It's the same description Jagr used to describe him. That and "unbelievable." As the Flyers failed to record a shot on goal over that second-period stretch - a power play finally broke the skein - Bryz was the night's entertainment. Fans chanted his name. Repeatedly. It almost sounded odd, given the civic debate that has surrounded his season.

Henson arrived in Minnesota three months after a landmark labor deal was struck in 2007. It would have raised minimum pay by 26 percent through the five years of the contract, elevating Minnesota's rank in the national pecking order. The board felt it could pay for the contract by drawing from its endowment fund. The 2008 market collapse shattered that assumption, and management projects a draw in 2012 that is $4.6 million below an estimate made back in 2007 (significantly, the orchestra is hiring a new investment adviser).

That amendment will go before the voters June 5.
So far, some nations have eased travel bans against top government officials, while Washington has relaxed financial restrictions to enable U.S.-based groups to do charity work in the impoverished country. The U.S. may also ease restrictions on American investment and financial services.
"All of us remember a time in our youth when the world was full of promise, when we were still deciding whether to be doctor or astronaut ... or for a few strange kids, politicians," said Commissioner Jeff Cogen.

Now imagine that on your 18th birthday that same country that tells you to believe in the power of dreams says never mind your dreams."

This unfamiliarity didn't worry Jagger or Stewart. "The idea was to get them into a room and see what you get cooperating as writing and playing," said Jagger.

And coming in May: If you've ever taken a turn on "the swings," those whimsical single-seat carnival rides, Six Flags has upped the ante some with its SkyScreamer, at 24 stories tall, what it bills as an "extreme swing ride." You're still in the swings, but much, much higher.

Third round action was where Gomez tried to press but that was short lived because Mahasin's momentum was strong. Mahasin started the round with a four round combination and Gomez had to be aggressive to catch up on the score cards and win the bout.

Foreider's advice was simple: be honest with them. Answer their questions. What they will remember are not the gory details of the murder, but how their parents handled the emotion. As the parents talked of possible memorials - tying roses to balloons, notes to trees - the children received counseling of their own. One boy had covered his ears to block out the news.

And so it goes. Some of the things you do are met with laughter and petting, others with "no" and confusing words you're not familiar with.
