You'll see him out and about having dinner, but that's it. He's not a real complex individual. He just loves football. He's coming to work with the idea of putting something on the field the people of Indianapolis will be proud of."

You are now ready for the handiwork of man. I suggest that you put it in with water-color, for if it blurs here and there, and lacks a very clear outline, that will be so much the better. The hills you can leave just as they were.

You might smear in some patches of green lawn, with hose sprinkling them: it will remind you that bringing water in by pipeline is still the outstanding accomplishment of man in this region.

Sure, Scouts have endured their share of scandal and controversy -- pedophile horrors and spats over the group's right to ban gays and atheists and to receive public funds, despite an emphasis on God and religion.

He is someone learning to exist, through all kinds of strategies, in our contemporary world. I wanted a character who was a bit like Elric (me) but dealing with modern mythology of various kinds. That's why the first few chapters of "The Final Programme" echo the first Elric story, "The Dreaming City."

I wanted a character who was able to exist in a lot of different contexts in contemporary cities, especially London. I wanted to put London in her modern mythological context, which I then extended elsewhere -- rural America, Vietnam and so on. The first story which tried this was "The Deep Fix," which was about as close to Burroughs as I've ever written and which was intended as a kind of bridge for a reader between the fantasy they were reading in the magazine and what I was enjoying in the Olympia Press Burroughs books.

In interviews with this newspaper several weeks ago, NOAA officials defended the cuts, saying that the government is trying to save money, and that the buoys would still operate, although they would take longer to repair when broken.

Such realities are merely a departure point for Hiaasen, who wraps them into new and unusual shapes that invariably involve trailer trash, or, more accurately, the comedic opportunities their lives present.

For one thing, couples are now postponing marriage more than any generation before them. While almost 60 percent of adults ages 18 to 29 were married in 1960, only 20 percent of today's young adults are married. Yet just because they are delaying marriage doesn't mean they want to delay commitment or intimacy. And, unlike previous generations, today's couples aren't judged or ostracized for cohabitating before marriage. Decades ago, a woman might hear "No one wants to buy the cow if they can have the milk for free," but today's woman has the freedom and the power to configure her own and make her own sexual decisions.

It's always felt like Headley was on the brink of breaking out any moment. He's been ownable in fantasy leagues at times, left on the wire at others. But a couple of numbers jump out at me from his hot start. First, he's swinging at fewer pitches out of the strike zone: 21% this year as opposed to 27% in 2011, per Fangraphs. Another encouraging sign, possibly as a result of the first statistic, is that Headley is walking more. He has 13 walks in 62 plate appearances, more than double the clip of his career norm. Headley's a go-to option for those in the market for a replacement third basemen.

Heat a heavy, nonstick 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When a few drops of water "dance" when flicked on the skillet's surface, brush the surface lightly with butter. Add 1/8 cup crepe batter to the pan, swirling pan in an even circular motion to distribute the batter. Dollop extra batter over any holes in the surface. Cook the crepe until the bottom is browned, about 1 minute. Using a spatula, flip and cook the other side, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer to a plate and cover the crepe with waxed or parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining batter, occasionally buttering the skillet if the crepes begin to stick. You should have 12 crepes.

Olsen: It's not like I'm trying to separate myself in any way, because my family is who I am so much. But it is interesting, because I knew -- my entire life, because I wanted to be an actor forever -- I just knew once I start working, it's going to be something that's going to be addressed, and then after a few years it's going to go away and you'll just be making movies and it will be just like any other family that has multiple people working.

It's no exaggeration - these may be the best (and priciest) steaks you will ever eat, slow-poached in butter and finished over mesquite. Ultra tender, ultra flavorful and ultra scrumptious. Look for the 32-ounce porterhouse, 10-ounce filet and 14-ounce, dry-aged American Kobe New York strip.
Barrett had entered the highway's exit ramp, a dangerous mistake she attributed to inadequate and poorly placed signage.

Floor-to-ceiling windows that seem to stretch to the sky offer one of the most magnificent views in the city. Yet all too often in the past, the food has not been an attraction.

Even in Portland's competitive caffeine scene, where edgy, perfectionist baristas are rewiring The Next Generation coffeehouse, Spella Caffe will slap your foggy morning brain upside your head. Andrea Spella does the unthinkable: turning out the best espresso ($1.75) and creamiest cappuccinos ($2.75) from a trailer kitchen, using farm-direct Brazilian beans that he micro-roasts in a rented garage nearby. No wonder the city's best baristas are regulars.

Hearst Castle is Morgan's most famous creation, but it is probably the least representative of her personal vision. At Asilomar, where she had carte blanche, you find Morgan in her element. This is the largest single collection of Morgan's work, and 13 of her original 16 buildings are still standing. Best of all, you don't have to stay at Asilomar to see them. Just call the local state park office at (831) 646-6443 to schedule a tour. (The Social Hall will be closed for renovation until early November; be sure to ask about closures when you call.) If rangers aren't available at the time you'd like, download a self-guided trail brochure and strike out on your own.

Texas went 5-7 last season, dropping five of its final six games for a rare losing season. After defeating Rice 34-9 in the opener, Texas faces a significant nonconference test Saturday when it entertains Brigham Young - another school with its own network, though this game will be on ESPN2.

WASHINGTON -- While U.S. President George W. Bush paid a visit last week to Brussels, my hometown of the last few years, I traded places with him and spent time here in Washington.

Carefully remove foil 45 minutes prior to serving. Move ribs (which at this point may be so tender they may fall apart) to a flat rack set on a foil-lined sheet pan. Reserve meat juices in the unwrapped foil. Baste sauce onto both sides of ribs, leaving the bone side up. Place back into the oven or onto the grill for 30-45 minutes. This additional finish time will "tighten" the meat so the ribs are pull-apart - not fall-apart- tender.

Remembrance Day, a time when thousands of Civil War re-enactors and living historians converge on the historic town to honor the brave men who gave their lives fighting in the nation's most famous battle, is always held the Saturday closest to Dedication Day. This year, both occur on the same day, making it a popular time to visit Gettysburg and pay tribute to these historic events.

The chain sells the shoes at full price and, despite a weak economy and sustained high unemployment, often sells out of them on release days. That shows what a powerful brand Mr. Jordan remains even though he played his last game eight years ago. The former player's Nike line accounts for about 70% of the $2.8 billion U.S. retail basketball-shoe market, SportsOneSource says.
"You've got to mix coverages up on him because if you get in the same coverage, the same steady diet, he's going to pick you apart," Brown said. "There's a chance he's going to pick you apart anyway because he's that good, but hopefully by mixing up coverages, you might buy yourself a couple extra possessions because he's unsure of what's coming at him. He's a talented player. You just have to make sure he works for every shot. Then at the end of the game, he's a little tired and will miss some shots."

She reported that she had topped her record and had baked pies and rolls for Thanksgiving. I’d better get my order in now for Christmas, and I’m hoping that she may consider making our family favorite: her banana cream pie. I never had any as good as the ones she used to make.
"If you're willing to put in the work, the idea is that you should be able to raise a family and own a home; not go bankrupt because you got sick, because you've got some health insurance that helps you deal with those difficult times; that you can send your kids to college; that you can put some money away for retirement," Obama said recently in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

"I feel, as a group, we are more comfortable with the defense," Webb said. "This defense is pretty complicated. There are pre-snap reads and reads during the play.

To explain the finer points of the evening, our waiter hopped into bed with us. The five-course menu ($60) is designed to be a surprise, much like the rest of the evening. He asked if we had any dietary restrictions, then headed to the patrons on the next bed, leaving behind a Chinese takeout carton filled with truffled popcorn. It's an appropriately symbolic snack, because throughout the night, diners are entertained by performance artists, singers and acrobats, who are often joined by the gregarious, energetic service staff.
Last year, Ethel Hedgeman Lyle Academy, once an Imagine school, closed because of financial failure.

I have a problem with those who rail against these fees as "hidden." Actually, airlines advise you pretty well up front before you buy. To me, the worst fees are those that Allegiant and Spirit charge to book online. The only way to avoid them is to buy your ticket at an airport counter, which -- for most of you -- would require an extra round-trip drive to the airport plus airport parking. Obviously, they don't want you at the counter; they want your extra money. That fee is a scam.

The brownfield fund is the second environmental initiative this year to collapse because of adjustments made in the past decade to expand eligibility and increase payouts without ensuring that the state can afford the changes.
First, the savings the unions' concessions are supposed to yield appear to be both overstated and insufficient. Negotiators say the city would cut its labor expenditures under the agreement by about $54 million -- less than half what Mayor Dave Bing hoped to realize.

"The immediate challenges these people faced were not geopolitical but intensely local: how, for instance, to open a jammed door, or navigate a flaming hallway, or climb dozens of flights of stairs," the authors write.

Both leaders profess respect for the other and a willingness to work together. But as the session heads into its final days, one of the main storylines is over who gets his way -- Kitzhaber and his reforms, or Hanna, who is pushing a sheaf of Republican-backed job bills.
CPAP often proves very effective at keeping the airway open during sleep, and it has been shown in a large number of studies to effectively improve the quality of life, daytime alertness, concentration and mood of the individual. Growing data suggests that it may reduce some of the medical consequences associated with apnea. But many people have a hard time adapting to sleeping with the device, so other treatments can be explored.
If recent NFL history is a guide, look for the Vikings to stay in downtown Minneapolis. On the other hand, the last two NFL stadiums went up in suburbs.
As with the Marian's Zinfandel, he also likes to give his wines names that suggest a story. He calls his verdelho "Miss Independent" both for his daughter pictured on the label and in recognition that he began to make the wine when virtually no one else was working with verdelho in California. His "Old Soldier" touriga was inspired by the photo of the circa-1950 Studebaker dump truck on the label. And the name "Bootleg" for one of his ports was inspired by his father, who had made a frantic trip to the Bay Area to retrieve a batch of port he'd made for a winery that he learned was about to file for bankruptcy.

Q. How are you doing?
Thatcher will not be denied. Facing prejudice when first entering Parliament, she rises through the ranks of the Conservative Party, eventually leading it and becoming prime minister. We see glimpses of the turmoil that gripped Britain at the time -- the whole movie practically screams for a punk-rock soundtrack from the era, although that probably wouldn't have worked because it would have been so much more political than the film.
GM said it did increase prices last year, but a less-profitable mix of vehicles eliminated any gains it would have made from those changes. In North America, the company said its financial fortunes improved because of higher overall auto sales and lower costs, not higher profits per vehicle.
But another AP story suggested a more muddled result : "Unlike previous Republican campaigns, when a primary winner would typically win all of a state's delegates, allocations this year generally reflect the split in the popular vote. As a result, several candidates may be able to claim success once the Super Tuesday results are known."
VOA, which in the past has coordinated winter shelter operations for the county, is soliciting funds for a "nomadic shelter" program in which homeless people are housed in churches and other houses of worship.

After a pilgrimage to the mineral-rich waters of the Blue Lagoon, we returned to our hotel, found dinner, then went in search of ice cream. It was still broad daylight.

Apparently, Icelanders don't take full advantage of their 24 hours of daylight.

Bentley had a good career at Louisiana-Lafayette, turning in 71 tackles last year and seven interceptions his last three seasons.

"A gutsy type of playoff win," Vogel said. "Holding them to 35 percent shooting is a very strong effort. They're a challenging team to guard."
A recent Defense Department report to Congress warned that foreign nations run a "grave risk" if they threaten or launch a large-scale cyberattack on the United States, and it announced for the first time that the Pentagon possesses cyberweapons the president can deploy in the face of such an attack.

Overall, with Moreno still a ways off from recovering from his ACL injury, the Broncos want another threat in their play-action run game beyond McGahee.

The White Stripes model of two-person bands has been in vogue lately, but Montclair’s Bible Gun takes that format in an unexpected new direction. A teenaged duo with a male singer on keyboards and a girl on alto sax, Bible Gun mixes indie pop with adventurous post-modern jazz — early Elton John meets Theolonious Monk. They haven’t recorded yet but expect big things from this very talented pair of teens.
ANSWER: We're still finalizing the demo, but the cooking demo will probably be me cooking pasta and taking questions from the audience and stuff like that. ... If we do the baking demo, it will probably be me doing some cupcakes and calling people up from the audience to cake decorate with me. I'll probably tell my story either way on how I became the cake boss and just take questions from the audience, and it's going to be a great time to be out with the fans and see how things are going.

As a native Angeleno, I was admittedly a bit skeptical about the city's genuine niceness on my visit here last month. Why are these bartenders so friendly? And why is everyone smiling when there's not so much as a palm tree or Technicolor sunset in sight? It could be because Chicago was having the mildest winter in years. Or maybe it was the booze talking.

While in high school, Frank did hand-lettering and cartoons for a sign company. He went to Michigan State in East Lansing, intending to become a commercial artist, but he spotted an ad in the student newspaper. The State News needed someone to do a daily cartoon and was willing to pay $5 apiece. This being 1961, $5 for a cartoon was good money, and Frank jumped.

It also created such an impressive portfolio that Frank was hired right out of college to be an artist and writer for Hallmark cards. During his four years in Kansas City, Mo., he worked with other professional cartoonists from around the country and learned enough about freelancing and syndication to launch his own career as a newspaper cartoonist.
