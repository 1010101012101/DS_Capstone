The criminal justice system undoubtedly meets the needs of some women; successful prosecutions do happen. Some abusers are sent to jail, and some stop their abuse, particularly when they are closely monitored following their release. But for women, the costs of engagement with the criminal justice system can be high: exposure to increased danger at the hands of abusers and, more problematic, the potential for violence from the state. Women who express reluctance to testify against their abusers are sometimes threatened with arrest if they fail to participate in prosecution; some are even told that the state will remove their children if they fail to appear for trial. Some women of color are understandably reluctant to increase the reach of the criminal justice system into their families and communities. Undocumented immigrant women who reach out to the criminal justice system for assistance have sometimes found themselves targeted for deportation instead.
"The ball just felt good in my hand that day," he said. "In the third or fourth inning I started thinking about (a perfect game) during warm-ups, but once I started throwing it just left my mind and I just threw."

Boorstin, who taught at the University of Chicago for 25 years, won the Pulitzer Prize and became the librarian of Congress (he died in 2004), was writing at a time when traditional culture was under assault from mass culture, and he didn't much like it. He believed in unalterable truths that had withstood the test of eons — things like heroism, art, primary experiences and high ideals. These were prima facie good. He also believed that anything that drew us away from these truths harmed ourselves and our culture. And he lamented that that was exactly what mass culture was doing to the country. It was substituting the false for the true, the dark arts of public relations and self-aggrandizement for the higher purposes of human existence.

Op-ed writer Dave DuGoff makes a very reasonable case for eliminating the paper dollar bill ("Sensible change: Switch to $1 coins," April 26).

The underlying problem is that food aid was linked to North Korean compliance in the first place. Had it not been, proceeding with the aid after the missile launch wouldn't have looked like a sign of weakness on the part of the U.S. And what of the future? White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said last week that if North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons program and abides by its international obligations, "there is an avenue available … to allow them to better feed and educate their people." Put another way, that means that hungry children will continue to be held hostage to the machinations of a rogue regime. Finding a way to feed those children remains a moral imperative.

It really started with the California Supreme Court's ruling in 2008 that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right. Of course we know that it isn't — and neither is marriage between a man and a woman.

Now the fun begins. Watch for cairns or faded paint blazes to help show the way as you clamber up, over and around the jumble of boulders in the draw. Just below the top you'll have to climb about 10 or 12 feet almost straight up a rock face. Some hikers use the tree on the left as a sort of ladder, but the narrow chute on the right is easier than it first appears, with plenty of good hand- and footholds.

On one visit I decided to do my own taste comparison between the 18-ounce wet-aged bone-in rib eye ($42) and the 10-ounce dry-aged rib eye ($45). The waiter also recommended the 10-ounce American Kobe flat iron ($49) that I saved for another visit; it was like a rich, fatty Wagyu, but with a firmer texture.

TAMPA, Fla. — He won the press conference in a blowout, but anyone who followed him at Rutgers knew he’d do that.
"I've lived with three men," she said, referring to Larry and their two sons. She wanted a decidedly feminine guest room that reminded friends of a turn-of-the-20th-century bordello. Larry joined in the design fun, using reclaimed-wood floors, rosebush-print wallpaper and a pressed-tin ceiling in the adjoining bathroom. A cowboy hat hangs from one of the posts on the four-poster bed.
Remarkably, the Cardinals' core has the same RC/27 as the with-Braun Brewers. If the Cardinals get the predicted production from, say, Craig that would change the total. Move out Furcal and move Craig into the quintet and the RC/27 jumps to 32.80. And that's where we see how one corner of baseball statistics views the chore of replacing Pujols' production.
The Colorado High School Activities Association has an entire section of its bylaws — Article 19 — related to recruiting.

Built like a Mack truck, the junior was Clinton’s heart and soul, its top defensive player at middle linebacker and dependable fullback. He ran for 964 yards and 11 touchdowns and had 63 tackles and a sack. It was no coincidence that the Governors chances of an upset in the semifinals against eventual champion Lincoln were greatly diminished when he suffered a high ankle sprain early in the first quarter and was unable to return.
Unfortunately, as has happened with so many other industries, government regulations have forced U.S. manufacturers to outsource much of their minerals production. Even though we have $6.2 trillion worth of mineral resources within our borders, a duplicative mining permitting process that can stall projects as long as 10 years discourages domestic investment, and, in 2010, forced U.S. businesses to import $5.1 billion worth of mineral raw materials to meet their needs. This means that much of the country's manufacturing growth is being fueled by foreign minerals, even when we could -- and should -- be producing those minerals here.
Joseph Peterson, manager of the Flying B Ranch in Idaho where the hunting occurred, told the AP that he asked Richards to shoot the mountain lion as part of an effort to control the population there.

What's more, by teaching intelligent design or creationism in schools, we run the risk of offending nearly everyone. Exactly which theory of intelligent design should we incorporate in schools? And what exactly should we call the "higher being" in question? If we choose intelligent design, we choose one religious theory while filtering out the rest. By teaching intelligent design, educators are sending students the message that one religious theory is, in fact, superior to the rest.

It's as if she were Bette Davis contemplating some woeful act in between puffs. The film harks back to dramas of the 1940s, such as "Now, Voyager," "Letter From an Unknown Woman" and David Lean's "Brief Encounter."

The statistical-analysis crowd (full disclosure: I am part of the statistical-analysis crowd) pegged Nova for a downturn this year, because he didn’t miss a great deal of bats and his .283 batting average against on balls in play seemed a little low.

That's what makes the last-minute machinations surrounding the expansion of Maryland gambling in this General Assembly session so perplexing. Although there are some genuine issues left to resolve in the debate over the state budget, it is clear that what's really holding things up is the Senate's insistence on moving ahead this year with legislation that could lead to a Prince George's casino. Senators appear intent on getting a referendum to allow a National Harbor casino (and with it, the legalization of table games throughout the state) on the 2012 ballot. Failing to pass a gambling bill before this legislative session ends would mean voters could not approve it until 2014 at the earliest.

Although defenseman Barret Jackman think the Blues "definitely have to be desperate" in Game 4, frustration isn't visibly building in the Blues, who are making just their second playoff appearance since 2004.

Prairie Ridge is labeled "difficult" on Lynch's website, and that's no exaggeration. It's about four miles into the run and likely to be your slowest mile split. It certainly was for me. But it also provides that advertised "sweeping view" of the bay and beyond, as well as varying terrain in the form of a section of big boulders in a clump of trees.
The scheme usually involves insiders who spread flattering information to drum up interest in a low-volume, low-value stock -- one that sells for pennies, or at most about $5 -- to increase the number of buyers and the price (the pump), before unloading their shares in advance of the stock's collapse (the dump).
Excerpt: Oregon is favored by two points in its Nov. 12 showdown at Stanford, and if you had a good feeling about the Dec. 3 Oklahoma-Oklahoma State game, you could have bet on it moons ago. (The Sooners are now a three-point favorite.) Recently, a peculiar new tradition has surfaced in football: Months before the first ball is snapped, point spreads begin to pop up. They're not just for the opening weekend, either. Spreads have been available for virtually every important matchup throughout the season since June, enabling fans to bet on games nearly six months in advance—never mind that a school's star quarterback could get hurt a half hour into the season, or the fact that some pro franchises still are figuring out who their primary stars will be.

"The most important thing was, we don't change the melody," the 62-year-old Richie said. "We may change a little bit of the arrangements, but we didn't change where the crowd comes in. So, yes we changed ‘Say You, Say Me' from this anthemic thing to a little bit of a ‘Lay Lady Lay' kind of feel, but the crowd still knows where to come in. ... I wanted to put a little thing in there where each of my guest artists felt like they weren't copping out."
Regarding its new dual-enrollment agreement with Gloucester County College, university officials say Rowan and GCC personnel are developing curricula for the program, which will welcome students, as planned, in the fall. The schools will hold information sessions once a month through September on the GCC campus. Some Rowan faculty will teach on the GCC campus, though the exact number is not known at this time. According to statistics provided by Rowan, South Jersey is home to 30 percent of the state’s 8.2 million residents, but the region offers only 12.5 percent of the state’s higher education seats. Rowan officials say they hope the joint effort with GCC will help increase the percentage of South Jersey residents who earn, at least, a bachelor’s degree. Today, only 24.19 percent of South Jersey residents hold at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to 37.14 percent of North Jersey residents and 27.5 percent of U.S. residents.

New Orleans isn't just a way of life, he quickly learned, it's its own atmosphere. And in those many months coaxing out musicians' stories, watching them play — he'd severely overstayed his welcome.

Downey gets much of the best dialogue. When Thor (who is wearing antlers and an acre of velour) shouts, “You don’t know who you’re dealing with,” Stark replies, “Shakespeare in the Park?

I also had to try the mac and cheese, which was rich with cheese and so good.

Come to think of it, Thibodeau’s handling of the delicate situation really wasn’t that odd at all. In actuality, by recessing his guiding light, he simply continued to play percentages that have paid astonishing dividends with Rose out of service for 24 of a possible 59 games due to assorted injures. Despite his prolonged absence, the Bulls have registered a 45-14 mark, best in the East, and own the league’s preeminent (21-8) road record.

In response to the caller of "Senior shame" of Nov. 10.: I am a member of your so-called "greatest whining generation." Yes, I probably have received more dollar bills than I contributed, but what about all the Social Security contributors that passed away shortly after retirement or perhaps passed before they retired? But perhaps even more telling is the monies I contributed in years past were worth two, three or four times the amount of the dollar I am currently receiving. Just check the CPI index from 30, 40, 50 years ago. No I am not ashamed of what I am receiving. But perhaps you should be ashamed of being an economic illiterate.

Now, he’s reminding Americans that there’s a lot of great music at the antipodes — no matter where on the globe you're standing.
