Most Rev. - and the most respected or disrespected - Al Sharpton really needs to stay out of St. Louis business. I think people are wanting voter IDs to be presented to be sure you're not illegal aliens, to be sure you're not a dead person, to be sure you're not a dead St. Louis alderman. All these people that have popped up through corrupt organizations in listing the signatures of people that don't even exist or addresses that don't even exist. So I think there's a real good reason whey we need to show a voter ID. We all get the right to vote, but we don't get the right to pad the votes, like in Iran. If Al Sharpton doesn't like what we're doing, he can go to Iran and become a citizen and vote.
"It didn't happen in our day," said Scott, who played in the NBA from 1983 to '97. "You played where you played, period. If you got traded, that was a different story.

4. Few teams play zone defense except as a change of pace because of rebounding problems in matching up and difficulty of trapping out of it or of pressing and recovering. But Syracuse is so effective in it that Jim Boeheim has been the zone guru for the USA Olympic team. It does not have to be the comparatively passive, arm-waving defense you see in high schools.

In fact, the two baby troops reminded me of some bizarre simian version of William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Instead of a group of school-age boys stranded on an island, these were motherless baboons kept separate from the adults for their own safety. They seemed to try to embody adult roles that in a real troop would have been filled by mature baboons. It was the job of the human volunteers to try to fill that adult role.

We are now as mobile as we've ever been as a culture. Our phones are not tethered to any particular location. Our keepsakes, like photos and letters, are all saved on devices smaller than your average drugstore paperback.

Your computer fits comfortably in your lap — everything else is in your pocket. We now have the ability to go anywhere and bring with us more things utilizing less space than at any other time in human history.

He didn't intend to unseat a model, the Flyer, that had held that honor for more than 10 years. He just wanted something that was more fun and higher-performing in the small punchy surf of his home breaks. Something he could drive hard out of a turn and hit the wave's lip with enough speed to do the aerials that have established Reynolds, at 26, as the most go-for-broke surfer in the world. Something that would turn like a swallow and float the landing after doing an airborne 360. So he walked into the manufacturing facility of his surfboard sponsor, Channel Islands Surfboards, in Santa Barbara, and began to talk with one of the shapers.

Like every other rookie in the league, Williams' development suffered right from the start because of a bitter labor dispute that prevented teams from working with their players all offseason. Once the union and ownership agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement, there was a mad rush to get the season started, resulting in an abbreviated training camp and preseason that made it difficult for the youngsters to prepare for making the jump from college to the pros.
Experts and some advocates acknowledge that federal courts have already interpreted the act to include those documents. But they say that specifically adding them to the Espionage Act would make it easier for the government to prosecute leakers.

Antico’s first role was as a restorer of classical fragments, working in Rome in the 1490s, where plowmen were finding things like the “Apollo Belvedere” buried in a cardinal’s vineyard. Antico was the first Italian artist to turn the Apollo into a bronze statuette (though hardly the last). The rage for classical recreation was already well established in 1490, but it was just entering its scholastic phase, with a growing emphasis on measured detail. Antico’s version of the Apollo is nearly perfect proportionally, and restores the figure’s missing hands with conviction; even more importantly, this reproduction began the artist’s involvement with 12-inch to 16-inch statuettes that express an outsized monumentality.

The fact that O'Leary was the player with the gesture is not at all surprising given his personality. He's as tough a competitor as anyone you'll meet.

On a more fundamental level, though, they also seem to agree on wine as a metaphor, though for starkly opposing world views. For Grahm, wine at its best allows the sensitive taster to glimpse the hidden workings of nature, to revel in unseen connections and to better understand his place in the universe.

The vast majority of our nation's children are educated by dedicated public school teachers who do not deserve denigration.

The title track to Cooper's highest-charting album, "Billion Dollar Babies" was a minor hit at best. But its stature has grown through the years and it remains a staple of the live show. Cooper shares the spotlight and the mike with Donovan, whose vocals are a hoot, especially his mock-dramatic recitation of the lyrics under Cooper's vocal as he worries that your little head will come off in his hands while dancing.

One final point of clarification. In the case of Tri-City Medical Center, while the medical center is a public agency, only about 2 percent of the district's annual revenue comes from the taxpayer. In fiscal year 2011, that amount was $7.4 million. The remaining 98 percent of revenue, or $309 million, had to be raised in the highly competitive, health care environment. In other words, Tri-City must compete for business against competing medical institutions - whether publicly operated like Palomar Pomerado or privately held like Scripps, Sharp and Kaiser. This model is completely opposite that of a city, county or school district. In those cases, those public agencies derive 100 percent of their operating revenue from taxpayers.

But if the Bay Area is looking for an immediate federal response, forget it. Authorities warn that for the first 72 hours, residents will be on their own, depending on the level of damage, and should prepare accordingly.

"We are very cautious about those, let's say, under 25," Flechner said. "The reason is twofold. One, are they adult enough? Are they making decisions and choices that they wouldn't regret later?

It was a difficult decision to take almost a year-long break from writing for the Post-Dispatch to uproot my family and pursue this project. The relationships I've developed with readers of this column are among the most rewarding things I've ever experienced as a journalist. When I write about my grandparents' long marriage, I get to hear stories about your own enduring marriages. You've shared some family secrets and memories of your childhoods. You've taken me to task when you've disagreed (some more kindly than others) and have offered support when I've exposed my own struggles.
There was lots of traction for a Kevin Durant MVP candidacy in the preseason. The Thunder star has had a fine year, but not done enough to prevent James from becoming the eighth player in NBA history win three MVP awards.
It's clear that opposing players don't like getting dunked on by Griffin, then seeing him pose over them. And then, beyond that, having to see the highlights over and over of the spectacular play.
People who had never owned their own home were powerfully drawn to Kinkade’s sentimental admiration of cute, empty houses in mountain glades, and his work came to represent the boom itself. Kinkade started licensing the rights to individual paintings to specific gated communities and even struck deals to “design” suburban developments that were then sold under his name. They often did not look much like his paintings at all.
Despite disagreement over details, law-enforcement officials, politicians and child-welfare advocates agree any extra attention to the most serious cases of child abuse and neglect is welcome.

Camping has long mystified me. Mankind has spent centuries getting comfortable with heat, well-constructed roofs, pleasantly firm mattresses and microwave nacho cheese. Yet, for some folks, there's a curious but undeniable pleasure in chucking all that we've worked so hard to create to live as we could have millennia ago.
So the central issue actually is, are the market-centric ideas Mankiw is teaching his students correct? Evidence from the recent economic meltdowns in the U.S. and Europe, where all of our economic models have proved useless, would seem to indicate that they aren’t.

--The Knicks won't know their first-round opponent until after the final games of the regular season are played Thursday. They will be in Charlotte to face the Bobcats and the Philadelphia 76ers will be in Detroit. If both teams win or lose, the Knicks, who own the tiebreaker with the 76ers, will clinch the seventh seed and face the Miami Heat. If the Knicks lose and 76ers win, they will drop to the eighth seed and face the Chicago Bulls. Neither team seems to be angling to land the higher seed, as the 76ers have left three rotation players back in Philadelphia, while Carmelo Anthony has already said he may not play in Charlotte and instead may take a game off to rest.

Those little glasses are still out there but they are hard to find. They survive in the taprooms of bowling alleys and rural taverns across Illinois and Wisconsin.

The night's only standing ovation came at the butoh-like, ash-covered conclusion of Yuri Possokhov's "RAkU," which premiered last year as a stylized vehicle for the dramatic intensity of Yuan Yuan Tan, Damian Smith and Molat. Set to a percussive East-meets-West score by Shinji Eshima, who also plays contrabass for the company's orchestra, this romanticized account of the burning of the Golden Pavilion temple in Kyoto still packs a punch, both emotionally and visually in Alexander Nichols' striking sets and projections.

"Breaking Dawn," like the rest of the series, is based on a Stephenie Meyer novel. But like the last "Harry Potter" installment, the "Twilight" literary swan song has been split into two films.

You may also be tempted to give the Blazers a pass on recent developments in this wasteland on the Willamette.

So far, however, the deal hasn't paid off. Natural gas prices are around $4.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. That's slightly below the price when the XTO purchase closed and well below levels seen three years ago. That's one reason, analysts say, Exxon's stock has lagged behind those of rivals Chevron and ConocoPhillips.
For much of his tenure, Bo's Chongqing had been widely lauded as an economic success. The city's gross domestic product rose 16.6% in 2011, faster than that of any other major Chinese city.

The Sixers were leading 68-61 midway through the quarter after a 12-0 run that Elton Brand started with a foul-line jumper. Then, after a basket by C.J.

No wonder countries that face nuclear threats would rather rely on their own arms than on empty UN promises.

Many blue-collar workers in Ohio and Michigan credit the federal bailout of General Motors and Chrysler for saving tens of thousands of auto industry jobs, says Paul Allen Beck, a political science professor at Ohio State University. The bailout began under President George W. Bush, but Obama expanded it. "There's a feeling the administration went out of its way to protect jobs that are very important," Beck said.
Still, I think I'm ready. I'm pretty sure I've logged enough hours in the pool, on the bike and out running to say I'm prepared. I'm especially looking forward to scaling back my night-time rides on the trainer. But at no point in my life have I felt fitter, stronger, or faster.

No more open lines of credit to students who have no income -- indeed, who have never paid a utility bill. No more mortgages to buyers who cannot afford the payments -- or to buyers who have no "rainy day" savings. Micro-print contracts must be transparent and protect the consumer.

"The great thing is I don't feel a thing," he said, referring to his leg. "It feels solid, it feels stable. No pain.

The docs gave me the clearance to play, so here I am."
I think I understand all that. I am aware the December 25 was celebrated as the birthday of Sol Invictus - the Unconquered Son - in the Roman Empire. That festival was certainly an impetus for placing the celebration of Christ's birth on the same day. You can call that syncretism or you can think of it as "myth become fact",

I consider myself a bit of an expert in this arena, having grown up and lived exclusively in big cities, all the while dreaming about becoming a farmer. Sure, the romantic stuff is seductive — the local this and that; the community of like-minded, rustic, well-read people; the delicious tastes of tomatoes, eggs and other foods untainted by pesticides. But you rarely read (unless you are deep into 4-H manuals) about where to begin, how to learn to be a farmer. Kurt Timmermeister seems fearless in this regard. He started a little cafe and bakery in Seattle, went in early every morning to make pastries and coffee, gathered a loyal clientele, decided he wanted a bit of land, bought 4 acres on Vashon Island (a ferry ride from the city) and moved steadily up the farming ladder, one step at a time.

The only issues that have popped up with student loans in relation to Treasuries is whether to choose fixed- or variable-rate loans for private loans, Ulzheimer says.

BofA underwrites loans more carefully now, but it funds “next to nothing,” Muolo said. It has fallen from first to fourth in originations as calculated by National Mortgage News, with production down 74% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.
For some suburbanites, it means new interchanges on I-285, I-85, I-20 or I-75 to get to work downtown or in neighboring counties and dodge the flood of interstate tractor-trailer freight traffic.

It was reminiscent of the last time we talked, in September 2001, a few months after the release of White's second album, "No Such Place," and shortly before the attacks of Sept. 11 changed the course of 21st-century history.

The equalizer came in the 12th minute after Kyle Naughton raced forward down the left flank and played the ball through to Hoolahan on the penalty spot. The Ireland midfielder did not connect properly with his shot but it was enough to squirm past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and across the line.
Abortion has become a high-profile topic in recent months as opponents of the procedure, who are somewhat stymied on the federal level by the Roe vs. Wade decision, have taken their fight to the states.

"When we look at history, you see that immigration goes up in times of economic prosperity and down when the economy is not doing so well," said Michele Waslin, senior policy analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Immigration Policy Center. The influx spurred opposition from many citizens, who said Irish immigrants were taking Americans' jobs and opposed the immigrants' religion. Politicians demanded laws to make it harder for foreigners to become U.S. citizens.
During the meeting, which also included Dwyane Wade, Dwight Howard, Chris Paul and Chris Bosh, Colangelo said he wanted only a two-year commitment this time, with those years being 2010 and 2012.

I worked through my share of the novels: "A Farewell to Arms," "For Whom the Bell Tolls." I was compelled, in places, yet still felt distant. Then, on a train from New York to Chicago, I discovered the 1925 collection "In Our Time," Hemingway's American debut. The 15 stories here include some of his most iconic: "Big Two-Hearted River," "The Three-Day Blow," "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife." These works helped rewire American short fiction with their bluntness, their lack of affect, their insistence that we read between the lines.

There was one problem with that thought. Greg Schiano built something here at Rutgers and in New Jersey that has become so special, that it is even bigger than him. He installed a set of core values in the program that if you buy into it, are not unique to him, but to Rutgers Football. Players now have pride in State U.

Some banks are parking portfolios of assets, typically commercial real-estate loans, in newly created off-balance-sheet vehicles. The banks then hire outside advisers such as private-equity firms to manage the vehicles. In some cases, the bank agrees to absorb the first wave of losses on the assets, but the losses or profits after that are divvied up between the bank and the vehicle's manager.
"I am not making arguments in a parochial way," said Miller, who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee and is certainly concerned about the potential job losses at Selfridge. Rather, she said, the Air Force has to look at what is "most cost-effective" for national defense, an area where the Air National Guard has a huge advantage over active duty forces; the needs of Homeland Security along "our long liquid border" with Canada, and what will be America's best strategies for national defense in the 21st Century.

Of course, there is little reason to believe the Maloofs are serious with this latest trial balloon. As we said Friday, they don't seem to have the financial means to invest in an arena project, just as they don't have the means to field a competitive team. And yes, there is that little matter of the city's $67 million loan to the Kings. How is that going to be paid back?

In the neighboring town of Ajijic, where foreigners have been settling for decades, 69-year-old American Chris Kahr was unloading groceries from his car when a thief jumped him from behind, fired a single bullet into his chest and fled.

They play slow-pitch softball, but this is not your casual Thursday night beer league. And the in-your-face nature of their disabilities doesn't inspire pity or sympathy - at least not after they start punishing the ball, flying around the bases and making highlight-reel plays in the field. Finch's Fellowship of Christian Athletes team won the other two games last weekend, including a 13-11 squeaker in the rubber match.

Artisanal bread expert Peter Reinhart recommends a well-hydrated dough that makes a crust with a light, airy texture, and the moisture keeps the crust from drying out in a super-hot oven.

As with many De Niro performances, there is always the threat he might self-detonate. (Because Jonathan is a cabbie, the film has obvious echoes of Taxi Driver, and also of the mirror scene at the close of Raging Bull.) But Weitz isn't one for such in-your-face menace.
