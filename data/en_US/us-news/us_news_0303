After drafting Blair Walsh last month, the Vikings let Longwell go to give him as much time as possible to find another team. ...

Armitage's translation strategy doesn't worry about literal or word-for-word translation: He wants to give readers a good story that is accessible. His introduction doesn't say enough about his choices in this translation, but of his "Gawain and the Green Knight" translation, he explained that he wasn't interested in producing "an exercise in linguistic forensics or medieval history; the intention has always been to produce a living, inclusive and readable piece of work in its own right. In other words, the ambition has been poetry."

Perhaps more significantly, the Hawks started Williams at small forward and shifted Johnson to shooting guard, hoping that would create mismatches and give Atlanta's top scorer more offensive chances.

I enjoy panel discussions when there are people on the panel who disagree with one another. I want to hear other points of view. But almost every other topic, the panel all appeared to agree.

If the judge went to the trouble to write that, that's something (The Star) should have considered, said my caller. I think she was getting at a principle I've heard from readers in the past, and it's one I agree with: These cases against Tierney and the diocese are civil suits or tort actions, not criminal prosecutions such as the child pornography charges against Father Shawn Ratigan. Anyone can file a civil suit for any reason  and we've all heard about the nuisance lawsuits that critics think the U.S. legal system allows to proceed without sufficient evidence.

Says Dr. Soumi Eachempati, Chief of Trauma Services at Manhattan's Weill Cornell Medical Center: "I feel the recent decreases in fatality data are due to many safety measures including better airbags, more states having seat belt laws, higher seat belt compliance, more strict drunk driving laws, better trauma care, better EMS, more traffic congestion in certain areas, and what some feel are safer road conditions."

Well, not quite. There was nothing despicable about Clinton's ad, which simply implied that her superior experience in affairs of state made her the best person to handle a crisis. As the incumbent, Obama enjoys the same advantage over Romney, so it's little surprise that his campaign is making a big deal over his wise management of the Bin Laden operation. What makes the ad more than a little distasteful is its characterization of Romney's past statements, which are taken out of context to make it look as if he wouldn't have bothered pursuing the Al Qaeda mastermind.
San Diego took a 1-0 lead on Yonder Alonso's RBI single with two outs in the second and was poised to add on when it got runners to second and third with no outs in the third.

The added weight is worthwhile, considering that the new model packs an improved display, camera and internal hardware.

Act 2: DVRs begin to count. Or rather, the Nielsen ratings people start to count DVR usage.

No problem there, she points out, as pharmaceutical companies have a big profit motive. Unlike in the European Union, companies in the United States can advertise directly to consumers and create the demand for them.
Each of the conceptual plans calls for leaving Union Station virtually untouched, though some call for wrapping new towers on three sides of the 1939 building.
Erin McGauley gave the Chargers their first goal five minutes into the game, and Cor Jesu led 3-0 at the half.
The win came one game after a loss at Duke in which the coach said the Terps were sloppy offensively. That game ended with Stoglin sulking on the bench.
The Wayne County Sheriff's Department received a search warrant, and investigators entered the home Tuesday and located the note.
"He's a drunk and a gambler. He would go down to Rio de Janeiro two or three times a year and do terrible things," Toder said. But the attorney said Durand broke away from Cook about June 2008, making Durand "more of a whistleblower than anything else."

"This definitely marks the end of an era," said Michael Gartengerg, an analyst for Gartner, but he added that "there's much more to Apple than Steve Jobs."
European airlines have no such restrictions. For years, no-frills discount airlines have added these credit card fees to their ticket prices. But now the larger air carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa and Swiss are catching up.

Dear Heloise:
In addition to the Richmond Heights location, the company is also seeking a zoning change to put in a store on Manchester Road in west St. Louis County.
Statisticians, statistical groups and several groups that use the data have lined up in opposition to the bill, including the American Statistical Association and the American Association for Public Opinion Research, a professional organization of pollsters. They say far fewer people would respond if they didn't have to, diminishing the validity of the results and detracting from a key benefit of the survey—its ability to produce detailed information about even the smallest subdivisions of the U.S. in between decennial censuses.
Could either be an investment killer? That seems unlikely given that the rich of this country have faced far higher income tax rates in the past. That those earning more than $1 million might pay a little more on investment income is not going to keep the rich from putting their money in the U.S. stock market or other domestic investment opportunities.
''Meeting Rita Marley was a great inspiration too. She seems to have had a big impact on him.''
"Responsibility for this in the end is ours," he said.
Months later, cleanup continues along the coast, from east of Sendai north to Hachinohe; 111 miles of coastline is part of Rikuchu Kaigan National Park, which includes some of the country's most dramatic beaches. Because of erosion and onshore and offshore debris, only two of the region's 64 named beaches - Funado and Jodogahama, a real beauty - are open.

"I think some people thought that the idea was a little crazy at first, but it caught on," says Newman, 33, who resides in Bethesda, Md. "I travel to these beautiful, natural and off-the-beaten path locations not normally covered in the media, and I do it with local people who are sharing their favorite spots you won't find in a guidebook." Newman also is the author of "Equitrekking Travel Adventures on Horseback" (Chronicle Books, $27.50).
Durbin and Kirk said levees provide some level of protection even if it is not certain they will protect against a 100-year flood. Both cautioned, however, that deficient levees should be repaired as quickly as possible. Fugate said the change in modeling would further delay final flood maps, which were expected to be implemented in December of this year.
In an instant, the life that the couple had planned when they met as students at Ohio State University was destroyed.
We suspect the same may be true for school shootings, as many school shooters have also committed suicide. One could argue that responsible journalism requires reasoned coverage of these events: provide information; stick to the facts; inform the public, but do so without providing undue exposure to the alleged perpetrators and without sensationalizing what are often incomprehensible acts of violence.
The real estate investment trust will buy, refurbish and lease recently built single-family homes. The new company will be based in Phoenix and hopes to eventually have $150 million to invest, according to a press release. It did not say where the company will buy homes, and a Beazer spokesman could not be reached.
After a defensive first half, Burroughs put together a drive that consumed 4:11 and produced a fourth-quarter lead. Holmes converted a fourth and 1 at midfield with a run and then converted a third down with a throw to set up a great run from Elliott, who took a second-down sweep to the left, cut back right and took off
People hate tolls, but they seem inevitable. Florida and every other growth state confronted with maintaining and expanding its transportation infrastructure must deal with the reality that the gas tax no longer gets the job done. Increases in the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks mean it is a poor long-term way to pay for tomorrow's roads and bridges.
Blind faith: At age 19, SDSU sophomore Jeremy Poincenot lost his sight due to a hereditary genetic condition. Although he became legally blind, retaining only some peripheral vision, he went on, with his dad as his caddie and coach, to become the reigning World Blind Golf champion for players with 6 percent vision, or less. He won the tournament in England with a dramatic chip-in of his ball during a playoff.
As recently as last month, the top general in the Air Force issued a memo warning officers against "the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs."
In the 42nd minute of Saturday's game, Marquez, defending a corner kick, jostled with Earthquakes midfielder Shea Salinas. The two tumbled to the ground, with Marquez falling over Salinas. As Marquez landed, he followed through with his right foot and deliberately kicked Salinas' upperbody. No foul was called on the play, but Salinas stayed on the turf and was then substituted. His collarbone had been broken in four places from the force of Marquez sandwiching him against the ground, but he was unharmed by the kick, Salinas told reporters on a conference call.
In the beginning of December, Benfield signed a deal that will put a 165,000-square-foot brewery at an industrial park in Havre de Grace, hoping to amp up DuClaw's craft beer manufacturing and distribution, as well as make it a place for various events.
NEW BRUNSWICK — Testimony is continuing this morning in the case of Dharun Ravi, a former Rutgers student accused of spying on his roommate.
How they were selected
Compared to other countries that didn't experience a decline, the study found four characteristics common to countries where young people are driving less: They are wealthier, a high share of the population is older, a high share of the population lives in large cities and a high share of the population uses the Internet.
Xavier might miss the NCAAs. Amazing to think, given where it began the year, but since the brawl with Cincinnati back on Dec. 10, the Musketeers haven’t been the same. Plus, of their final five games in A-10 play, three are teams with winning records in the conference.
Young will not be ready until late May, Ricco added.
"I'm optimistic that the district will take these recommendations seriously and act on them," Price said. "I think that's the litmus test. We can't change the past. We will provide them a path forward."

Every fan of the 1939 classic film "The Wizard of Oz" should plan to travel to Columbia during the next two months to visit the magical land of Oz at Toby's Dinner Theatre.
"The Romney folks are going to have come up with a better answer," said Wilson, who is not affiliated with any campaign. "Because in a Republican primary, you can't talk about your record as governor of Massachusetts," a liberal state where Romney adjusted his positions on same-sex marriage and abortion rights.
"I think it's a disservice to the families to build it anywhere else -- 90 percent of the families are Cleveland families," he said. "You can't just go back and forth on a whim."

On the road: Hats off to Toyota because it has made the gasoline-electric interface the smoothest I’ve felt yet in both this Prius and the 2011 Prius X. (Honorable mention goes to General Motors, for the Chevrolet Volt and Buick LaCrosse eAssist.)
Smith began honing similar methods in the early 1980s with the project she dubbed "On the Road: A Search for American Character." They coalesced in "Fires in the Mirror," her award-winning one-woman show about a violent fallout from rising tensions between Jews and blacks in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in August 1991, and later in "Twilight."

Because Cameron makes enormous, exciting spectacles, yes. But if you look a little deeper, they’re always about love, and strong women.

When Urdangarin testified behind closed doors in February before a judge in Palma, he described himself as a mere figurehead at the nonprofit foundation—called the Noos Institute—and said the foundation's business dealings were handled by Torres, according to media reports.
TOWER GROVE -- When it comes to acquiring some of the most highly regarded, highest-ceiling young talents in baseball, no team in the major leagues has spent has much or as willingly as those noted checkbook barons at the confluence.
First, commissions. The centennial project of five world premieres leading to the orchestra's 100th season in 2018 is itself admirable. Orchestras and audiences are in constant need of replenishment through works by composers who savor the colors and expressive richness a mass of instruments can produce.
"You've got to separate them by size," said Ryan. "I have four small dogs and if I took them to a dog park I wouldn't let them around a large dog. Dogs can be unpredictable. Even though it may be a sweet dog at home, it's not known how it's going to react to other dogs."
Suppan spent the entire 2011 season with the Kansas City Royals Triple-A franchise in Omaha. He didn't receive a minor league contract from the Padres this year until a week before spring training opened. And after looking sharp early in the exhibition season, Suppan suffered a strained triceps muscle and was rehabbing in extended spring training in Peoria, Ariz., when the regular season opened.

And for what — to reduce gas prices? Federal studies show that even if economically recoverable oil is pinpointed, it would take decades for oil production to come online, and even then would reduce gas prices at the pump by only 3 cents per gallon. Oil and water don’t mix, and neither does a clean ocean economy (including fishing, boating, diving and tourism) and “Big Oil.”
The Answer: It's not a simple answer. First, there's nothing in the law or banking regulations that requires a bank to freeze an account in the event that one account holder dies, said Dennis Ginty of the Ohio Department of Commerce.

One big perk of running a small kitchen is that Batson can supervise her cooks as they experiment. On a hot day, after only five months on the line, Newmark suggested a light gazpacho as a special. The dish sold out in an hour.
Or is it? When I was in high school our church youth group used to sing a song lifted directly from the Hebrew scriptures: I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse and the rider thrown into the sea. It's taken from Exodus 15:21, the song Miriam sang after the children of Israel not only crossed the Red Sea on dry land, but saw the Egyptian army swallowed up behind them. It's a song celebrating the victory of the people of God, but it also celebrates the death of an untold number of Egyptians (and their horses). Singing that peppy little number never bothered me, perhaps because the Exodus was long ago and far away and clearly God's doing, besides.
Keffer also said attrition, not layoffs, had cut into the firefighting contingent.
Four years ago, my dad's 69-year-old heart called it quits, and I inherited one of his old flannel shirts. I bought it for him when I was still in my 20s, and I wear it occasionally when I'm working in the yard. I cannot help but smile whenever I pull it on. It's an Arrow XL and it's plaid, like all his flannel shirts. It stood out in his closet, too, because it was a palette of pastels: light blue, dusty cream and pale teal.

After two years of a federal infusion of funding for summer jobs, things are back to normal for many Ohio teens: the prospect of yet another jobless summer.
What was a 3,490-page budget in a House committee is now a 4,800-page Senate draft. Few of Ohio's 132 legislators can have any clue about what's in it. That's not policymaking. That's Russian roulette -- and it's no way to guarantee the lottery's integrity and lasting profitability.

That brought on the "closer" Jason Motte, who got Shane Victorino to fly out to end the inning.
The radar-evading F-35 fighter jet, a nearly $400 billion weapons program under development for more than a decade, is facing its worst turbulence since Washington decided to buy it in 2001 —when it was billed as the most affordable, lethal and survivable military aircraft ever.
Although Encores! productions such as "Gypsy," "Chicago" and "Finian's Rainbow" have made it to Broadway, fans of the long-running City Center series know such transfers are beside the point. The Encores! mission is not to spawn commercial hits, but to briefly resuscitate neglected, ill-loved musicals. That goal is perfectly illustrated by Kurt Weill and Maxwell Anderson's "Lost in the Stars," which is playing through the weekend.
Growing up, Theodore Szal said he felt like the "black sheep" of his family. While his three pretty sisters were cheerleaders in school, he was more of a rowdy class clown, he said.
Employers have not started hiring a lot of workers because of worries about potential tax hikes and unknown costs associated with health care and financial regulatory reform passed earlier this year. Consumers have also kept their spending down, which has kept a lid on hiring.
The double-dip sweep of Columbus gives the Blues six wins in their last seven road games and starts a marathon, seven-game swing on a positive plateau. The Blues did not feel they were at their best Saturday despite the 4-1 margin. Less than 24 hours later, they took it down a notch.
“Technology is a big focus for the school,” Delf said. “So this will have a real impact on the students and the teachers who have to revise the lesson plans.”
Miller won't hear his name called as early as former Buffaloes offensive lineman Nate Solder, who was selected 17th overall by New England in the 2011 draft, but he could be a nice mid-round pick-up by a team looking for depth up front. Miller has great size and a work ethic that is just as big. The native of Littleton, Colo., graded out at 83.3 as a senior, allowing just one sack and committing two penalties. Miller was an All-Big 12 honorable mention as a junior after playing every snap on offense, starting all 12 games at right guard. He graded out at 88.9 percent and yielded two sacks that season while getting whistled for two penalties. Miller was granted an extra year of eligibility after missing a majority of the 2008 season with a broken fibula. He has long arms and does a nice job controlling defenders, but there are concerns that he could be at a leverage disadvantage in the run and pass game. Miller, though, has shown good footwork and can pull from the backside to deliver hits on targets. At the NFL combine, Miller recorded 32 reps in the bench press and showed some nice athletic ability in the vertical jump (28 inches) and broad jump (100 inches).

It is indeed a frightening prospect. While some layoffs are necessary to help the city deal with its $8.4 million budget shortfall, the severity of the police department cuts is a legitimate cause for alarm.
At many airports, paramedics are on call for medical care; parking-lot buses are deployed to move people between terminals or to hotels. Among the amenities big airports now routinely stock: cots, blankets, diapers, baby formula, eye masks, prepaid phone cards, ear plugs, deodorant and shampoo. For the second big snowstorm in New York this winter, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey started handing out free WiFi cards to stranded customers at New York City's three major airports so travelers could check their flight status online at airline websites.

The magazine was then in its glory days, printing 2 million copies per issue — enough, Abercrombie writes, to form a stack a mile and a half high. That meant plenty of resources, the time to do articles well (three months was not an uncommon span, a rarity anywhere today) and an almost limitless canvas. Over the next four decades, the pair visited all seven continents between them, facing down myriad logistical challenges while capturing jaw-dropping vistas as well as the kinds of smaller moments that bring huge subjects to life.
“I’m really proud of our guys because they came back and showed incredible heart, toughness and courage to get back in the game and turn a street fight into a war,” Gonzalez said.
The fireplace had been partially covered in drywall, possibly as a cost-saving alternative to brick when the house was built. Braseth saw it as a missed opportunity to highlight the continuous structure on two floors. After a search through salvage yards and other sources, vintage bricks were found to match the size, pattern and groove depth of the existing bricks.
MySpace will invite other social networking sites, age and identify verification experts, child protection groups and technology companies to participate in the task force on age and identity verification technology.

Mike McCall played just 18 minutes, his fewest since early January, as Jett got the minutes at the other guard spot. I kept thinking that late in the game, Majerus would bring in McCall for his ballhandling and free throw shooting as SLU tried to run out the clock, but it didn't happen. McCall was 0 for the game.
Eventually, the conversation veered toward other topics, and I asked McMillan if, with the Blazers about to start their second back-to-back-to-back of the season, he had considered anything outside the box. Would he ever consider do something crazy like playing his reserves for the entire second half?
Nate Florea, T.C.A. 43-50 - 93
Williams also implores his charges to "lay out" Smith and later adds, "We need to decide whether Crabtree wants to be a (expletive) prima donna or he wants to be a tough guy. He becomes human when we ... take out that outside ACL."
Others worried the international franchise would put nearby Fred Meyer or Safeway out of business or won’t build to the level of sustainability the community wants from new businesses. Resident Dick Jones defended the company, though, saying residents should focus on making the designs better, rather than trying to stop the move.
The utility fee increase currently scheduled to take effect this summer would generate almost $800,000 of a $2 million plan to benefit schools. The rest of the money is coming from budget cuts or reserve funds.
The Pillars, built in the 1870s in the Second Empire style, was sold several times, expanded and renovated, and in the 1930s was bought by Albert Register, a descendant of a well-to-do family from the Main Line of Philadelphia.

Anne Kaplan, Bruce and Deborah Crown, Ed and Dia Weil, and Aleksandra Efimova joined ABT artistic director Kevin McKenzie and executive director Rachel Moore at the celebration. McKenzie recounted his days as a dancer, performing at the Auditorium Theatre, and expressed his excitement about returning to "one of the best theaters in the country."
What do you do? I take the event from simply a sit-down dinner and elevate it and bring some personality to it. I don't get involved with the food preparation. I'm not a caterer. I will get involved with menu selection and finding the appropriate place to hold the event. Then I go into a custom design that really helps them tell a story that is unique that kicks off the wedding that is going to happen the next day.
The resorts also have varying operating schedules so check their schedules. Some of the die-hard bikers will be on the peaks until late October, when the first dustings of winter snow typically start to drift across the Sierra.
"I can't run this by myself," she said. "It would always be too hard to do. We're not going broke. My accountant said it would be best to liquidate and sell everything."

April temperatures:
Still, Bush's second term isn't over, and an array of prominent -- or notorious -- offenders are hoping that the president will rise above principle and spare them prison time or wipe their criminal records clean. Some are former government officials, such as Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from defense contractors, and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, whose sentence for perjury was commuted by Bush last year. Others, such as junk-bond king Michael Milken and former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K.

To manipulate the wines to appeal to a broad market masks their greatness. On one particular occasion, I tasted seven vintages of a great (unnamed) Burgundy. All were highly rated, staggeringly expensive and very rare. But for the most part, the wines were over-oaked and under-wined. They had no balance, not enough extract to carry the oak, and the fruit was leaving as they aged so all that remained was the oak tannin, as is always the case.
How does that happen? Small groups and one-on-one conversations, he thinks, where everyone is heard. "Let everybody say their piece," Pederson said. "Talk about it."

There has never been a Cavaliers season quite like this one, the team's 40th. Two future Hall of Famers are on the roster, both in the final year of their contracts. The pressure to win a championship has never been greater, the scrutiny on the team never so intense, and the stakes have never been higher. Plain Dealer Cavs beat reporter Brian Windhorst has been chronicling the historic season. Along the way, he'll provide an all-access look at the wild ride. Here is the first entry:
"That is why the whole system is fighting us," said Anyfantis. "Because they are afraid that when we get into Parliament, the Greek people will understand that we are neither a gang, nor Nazis, nor children of Hitler. ...

Mr. I'll-Sing-What-I-Want met those who would dismiss him as "the guy who wants to be Dave Matthews" head-on when he chose a Matthews song for this contestant's choice round.

Fact: The 3C&D "Quick Start" would be a 79 mph train. In fact, the train would run at 79 mph for 70 percent of a trip from Cleveland to Cincinnati. This 79-mph system would provide the foundation for a higher-speed system, allowing speeds to be increased incrementally, over time, as has been done in other states. Top speeds initially will be limited to 79 mph, but speeds could be increased to up to 90 mph for much of the trip between Cleveland and Columbus, based on Ohio's memorandum of understanding with CSX.

Rima Dali's act of defiance last month — which landed the 33-year-old in prison for several days — was a call for the opposition to focus again on peaceful protests to bring down President Bashar Assad. It has inspired other activists who worry that their cause is going astray as more Syrians take up arms in the face of the regime's withering crackdown.
There’s not much to say about the Yankees' decision to bring back the iconic southpaw, other than, “Why not?” If Pettitte shows over the next several weeks that he can still pitch effectively, then the Yankees may have bought themselves a nifty piece for $2.5 million. If he gets batted around, and doesn’t look to have the stuff to succeed, you shake his hand and pretend this never happened.
The real bummer for WhoDat Nation, though, was that the December-woeful Dallas Cowboys pierced the Saints' perfect season with the sharpness of a voodoo needle, winning 24-17.

Rubin says the firm—which also has a history of providing pro bono legal services throughout the community—has nurtured that kind of collegial atmosphere since its inception. “We look for people we think have the same approach to working together that we’ve always had,” Rubin says. “That means from the hiring process through the mentoring process, we try and make sure that everyone is working cooperatively. It also means that I can ask someone for help when I need it. Instead of fostering an atmosphere where I can only win if you lose, everyone here understands that we do best when the firm does best.”

Rep. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, a community college instructor, said he was disturbed that out-of-state companies seem to be "hijacking" the state's charter school laws by making big profits off of online schools.

Deputy County Attorney David Plymyer, who argued against granting the restraining order, said Jones' absence would impede the operation of county government because he would miss several public meetings at which important legislation is considered.

As an electoral exercise, the party has been an unmitigated flop. Hanging chads. Dead voters. Relatives lurking near the ballot box. Jimmy Carter himself couldn't straighten it out.

He does not pull a punch when it comes to boxing or even to the tastes-great, less-filling Miller Lite commercials he once made, where Deford and others came to have no respect (seriously) for a certain Mr. Dangerfield or what a jerk (actually a stronger word) he found wrestling promoter Vince McMahon to be. Just as he can zing a heart string with a shared experience with Jimmy the Greek, a pair of dads who between them lost three kids to cystic fibrosis.

At the heart of the project are three long conversations he pieced together with Hillary Chute, a former graduate student who teaches at the University of Chicago. ("Everything takes me so long," Spiegelman laments.) Built around the central questions of his post-"Maus" existence — Why the Holocaust? Why mice?

Pediatricians' efforts to play a positive role in their patients' health "may be undermined if they use stigmatizing language that can hinder important discussions about children's health," the authors wrote.

Unlike after the one-run loss by the Trojans last year, the water flowing this time came from a cooler aimed at Troy coach Lance Richardson rather than tears of defeat streaming down the cheeks of Troy players.

But I think there's something else at work here: For your typical self-conscious but wealthy New Yorker with egalitarian ideals, it's hard to imagine anything more uncomfortable than patronizing a store meant just for rich people. We want our high-end stuff, but we don't want to look elitist. The children's books (and Snickers bars and Converse sneakers) offer gentle reassurance: You are not a jerk.

As I said, I suppose there's an argument to be made that the early church allowed too much paganism into its practices. I'm not making that argument, but it can be made. What seems far more dubious to me is to assume that those practices, completely decontextualized from the ancient world, turn modern Christians into pagans. When a family gathers near their tree and sings "Happy Birthday" to Jesus, I don't think that worship is transferred to an ancient solar deity. I don't want to speak for Jesus, but I think he knows what we're doing; he understands the intent of our hearts and our desire to celebrate his coming. And I can't imagine that the Unconquered Son. the one who is both Suffering Servant and King of Kings, is offended if we've gotten the day wrong. I'm petty about how my birthday is celebrated. I'm sure that Jesus is not.

For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it.

A: Land Rover was not ranked among brands in J.D. Power and Associates' 2012 Vehicle Dependability Study because J.D. Power said it received too small of a sample size, but in the 2011 study, Land Rover ranked 32nd out of 34 brands.
