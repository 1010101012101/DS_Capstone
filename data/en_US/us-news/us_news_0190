"The vast of majority of birds that are shot probably don't survive," Sallinger said. "They die and they're scavenged on the ground and no one ever finds them. The fact that we get in as many birds that are shot as we do is indicative of a much larger problem."

After I'd left for college in 1983, the state established a 779-acre natural reserve there, protecting the point's rare ecosystems and making a sanctuary of its beaches and waters. But getting there requires a grueling 2.5-mile hike over that lava-rock-strewn dirt road.
"The quality that makes a mom wonderful is balance," says Walfish. "She is comfortable with both nurturing her child and being clear, firm and following through. She is warm and sturdy, and at the same time she is tender and strong. She is in perfect harmony. She is balance."
"It’s already too much," he said. "I doubt it will hit $4. Maybe it will get to $3.70."
"Maybe," Shaheen said. "We like places that are a 'just-add-water'-type of scenario. We learned in the last several years, there were just some buildings that we were going to because we had been. And we weren't particularly evaluating them. We're not there yet (in perfecting the evaluation process) — we're getting better at it. I don't think our needs are that significant, but certainly it helps when a building is ready for us. And Newark did a great job."

After 35 years as a professional photographer, I continue to be inspired and amazed by Yosemite. There have been so many great photographers who have followed in the giant footsteps of Ansel Adams and have taken his teachings and examples to new heights. Yosemite is a breeding ground for some of the most talented landscape photographers in the world. Resident photographer Nancy Robbins made one of my favorite pictures of a moonbow at the base of Yosemite Falls, perfectly aligned with the Big Dipper. She may not have been the first to photograph a moonbow, but hers is one of the most incredible images made of the phenomena of the light. Michael Frye has made some amazing images around the park, demonstrating his expertise with alpenglow, sunsets and pictures throughout the four seasons. Frye produced a must-have pocket-sized book, "The Photographer's Guide to Yosemite." With examples of Frye's work, photographers shooting pictures in the park turn to the book for helpful hints about light and locations, and a great listing in the appendix shows the sun and moon tables.

"They drew first blood," said Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins. "I'm disappointed that we lost but there is a lot of basketball yet to be played."
Despite Bob Kravitz pandering to Andrew Luck, getting rid of a healthy Peyton Manning was the biggest mistake ever. Telling the fans that Manning would play again only as a Colt, probably the second biggest. Does Kravitz not remember the 2010 season when Manning dragged a horrible team into the playoffs with a bum arm?

George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a rich and famous movie star with a legion of fans, a mansion, a loyal driver, Clifton (James Cromwell), a spoiled wife (Penelope Ann Miller) and, of course, a small dog -- all the trappings of early-20th-century fame. Valentin makes blockbuster hits for Kinograph, a company run by Al Zimmer (John Goodman).

This struck me as being a bit strange. I, being the shy person I am, wrote a letter to the governor and asked him if he thought this is a bit strange. He did not respond but rather transferred my question to the State Police in Trenton that handles firearms permits. So about two weeks ago I received a phone call from a trooper which will remain anonymous. He explained to me that the reason they require money orders and do not allow checks is in case the check bounced because of insufficient funds and it would place a financial burden on the state to cover the insufficient check charges. I ask him to give me that in writing which he did. I also asked the trooper to pretend he was not in a State Police uniform and look at my question from a citizen’s view point and did he think the requirement was logical. He declined to answer the question. I asked the question several times.

The light-hearted approach carries over to the menu, which boasts dishes with whimsical names such as "Nacho Mama," "Soylent Green" and "Chairman Meow Rice Bowl." But that doesn't mean you shouldn't take seriously what they're serving.

If the opponents of these ballot measures really do believe they are more about presidential politics than marriage, let me offer a compromise, which I am certain I can convince my fellow supporters of traditional marriage to accept.

There's sex aplenty, enough to garner an NC-17 rating. But there is nothing erotic about it, nothing sexy, nothing but a brutish satisfying of carnal desires. Without an astounding performance from Michael Fassbender, it would be almost too painful to watch (and at times, too boring). With him, it's not exactly easy.

Haring opened the Pop Shop in New York City in 1986, marketing T-shirts, pin-on buttons and original prints. As Gianni Mercurio notes in his 2005 essay, some controversy erupted over the legitimacy of this commercial operation, as well as Haring's advertisements for Absolut Vodka and designs for Swatch Watch. And yet he was beloved by the activist community and seen as consistently counter-cultural in spirit.

All those wheels and levers and gauges aboard a submarine or a warplane may bewilder visiting civilians -- but a highly trained crewman who is surreptitiously answering to an authority higher than his commanding officer would know exactly how to use them to create death and destruction.
The photo with the bee hovering around the lupine flowers was shot near the redwoods in Wawona, near the south entrance to the park. It may look simple, but it actually took a while to compose, waiting for the right light and the bee to swing by for a visit. The picture was shot with a Canon 5D, a 100mm macro, set at 5.6 with a shutter speed of 1/2000th and the ISO was set at 200. I started looking around for this picture at 8 a.m. and wound up taking it two hours later.

That challenge partially explains why Optima paid so little for the huge building. The recession wounded the commercial real estate market, knocking as much as 30 percent to 40 percent off property values, in some cases. But the Huntington deal is striking.

3) Army’s Henderson. Thul has been the beneficiary of an opportunistic transition game. The fastbreaks have usually been keyed by senior long-stick midfielder Tim Henderson, who has recorded three goals, three assists, 56 groundballs and 20 caused turnovers. Henderson, who was recently named the Patriot League’s Defensive Player of the Year, will be someone Johns Hopkins plans to account for. “You’ve got to find him off a save, you’ve got to find him in transition, and if you take a poor approach or don’t approach him with the level of respect that a stick handler like him deserves, then he runs by you and creates a slide or he creates time and space for himself to let it go,” Pietramala said. “I think their transition starts with him and their goalie, and that’s certainly an area that we’re going to have to be very aware of.”

Things picked up a bit after World War II and, in 1959, the city incorporated. Muller, who was a teen then, remembers that it was shortly after that that floriculture began to flourish. Soon it would be one of the biggest industries along the coast. During the following 25 years, the city experienced its most rapid rate of growth. Fields of houses popped up next to fields of artichokes, chard and lettuce in subdivisions called Wave Crest, Arleta Park, Alsace Lorraine, Grand View Terrace, Casa de Mar, Frenchman's Creek. Residents concerned that Half Moon Bay was in danger of losing its small-town character as well as its agriculture pushed for measures to control development, which the city adopted.

Just what merits protest, anyway, isn’t as clear as it once was. K8 Hardy, the fashion artist, has devoted a wall of (often witty) photos and prints to the fact that women’s shoes hurt. The Occupy Wall St. Arts & Labor group has protested the Biennial itself this time, denouncing the Whitney for taking sponsorship money from DeutscheBank and the auction house Sotheby’s. (Sotheby’s, the OWS group noted, locked out its unionized workers last year.) They said the Biennial “perpetuates a myth that art functions like other professional careers and that participation in the exhibition, for which artists themselves are not compensated, will secure a sustainable vocation. This fallacy encourages young artists to incur debt from which they will never be free … .”
Too often, the one-and-doners rarely even attend classes during their second semester as they play in the NCAA Tournament and get ready for their ultimate jump to the NBA. Then they disappear, and all that is left is an empty chair in an abandoned classroom.
We may think we come by our opinions through something close to a rational process: weighing the evidence before us and using our powerful human brains to reach appropriate conclusions. According to Leonard Mlodinow's new book, "Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior," that assumption is far from the truth. In fact, our beliefs are determined, much more than we know, by our subconscious preconceptions. This may explain why I was somewhat underwhelmed by the book.
Feel free, though, to sue a government agency in America: A few years back, the Port Authority -- which, recall, was barred from suing in the case against the Saudis -- was found 68 percent liable in the '93 World Trade Center bombing (more than twice as much as the terrorists themselves).

* That's how you learn about quarterbacks, get a sense of their feel for the game, their natural instincts, and their ability to cope with breakdowns. If Gabbert's footwork is going to get all helter-skelter, it isn't going to happen during a customized workout. It'll happen in a game at the Superdome, or Lambeau Field -- with all sorts of hell breaking loose around a visiting QB. Bradford already has shown that he can handle the heat. And you never really know about a young QB until he's in the pit, fighting to make plays while keeping his cool.

Levin has a gift for voice, for creating enticing narrators. Whether it's the elderly, dirty-minded Jewish men of "The Extra Mile" or the adolescent Italian-American toughs of "Finch" and the white working-class boys of "Hot Pink," these are stories that grab the ear first. This is a great start, but more often than not, they don't have far to go. "The Extra Mile" is a funny anecdote, and "Finch" (about fathers, sons and half-truths) is relatively straightforward compared to the two earliest, more complex pieces.

It's an adage among rockers that when a musical trend reaches Hollywood, it's over. After tonight, the Gregory Brothers ought to be looking for a new angle. In a segment that was neither funny nor novel, the Academy Awards attempted to "Auto-Tune" lines from popular movies ("Social Network," "Harry Potter," etc.) and turn them into songs. For those who hated this trend to begin with -- my hand is up -- its inclusion in the Oscars broadcast is a reason to applaud. It'll never seem cool again.
