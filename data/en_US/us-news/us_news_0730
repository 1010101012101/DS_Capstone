After completing the list, the trustees realized they must choose some cuts to present to the county Board of Education and retain control of district finances.

Greene is a versatile talent who has been inconsistent at this level. The Cardinals made him the 30th overall pick of the 2005 draft and he'll receive every chance to succeed, especially given a more pronounced develop-from-within approach regarding the bench and bullpen.

The lawyers are done for now in the Proposition 8 trial. Charles Cooper finished his opening statement, defending the need for society to preserve the traditional definition of marriage and limit it to heterosexual couples for its procreative purposes. He told the judge that marriage must be "pro child," and that would be at risk if same-sex couples were allowed to marry. Cooper insisted that the courts should stay out of the issue and allow the voters to decide whether they want to allow same-sex marriage, but the judge questioned that thesis. "There are certainly lots of issues taken out of the body politic. Why isn't this one of them?" the judge asked at one point.
Over the last decade, Nagele documented his own theory of the disease focusing on the so-called "blood-brain barrier" which separates proteins and antibodies in the blood of healthy patients from their brains.

Inflammation and irreparable damage — and degenerative dementia — are the results, Nagele and his team hypothesize.

Baltimore's property tax rate, more than twice that of any other jurisdiction in the state, is unquestionably a drag on investment in the city. It needs to come down in general, and not just for homeowners — commercial investment, which leads to job creation, is held back by the tax rate, and rental housing, an important consideration in a city with a high poverty rate, is made more expensive by the high taxes. But it makes sense to target the limited funds slots will produce to homeowners. The city's best hope is for families and individuals to buy and improve undervalued properties and, bit by bit, turn around neighborhoods. Cutting the rate by 20 cents for homeowners makes the economics of such a proposition at least somewhat more feasible.

Every time I drive to the valley, crossing the highway bridge over the shallow Salinas River, the sky yawns amply and I recall the topography, which John Steinbeck described in "East of Eden." It was rich land for which men hungered  land that men fought pitched battles to take or retain. It was the same kind of land that the Communists in my great-grandfather's Manchuria wrested away from the haves to be redistributed  not necessarily fairly. From the stories passed down to me by my father about the House of Yang, eight generations in the telling, I inhale the love of land.

Here's what happened: A couple of episodes ago, The Situation and wingman Pauly Delvecchio were entertaining two ladies at the house; The Situation was making progress with a brunette named Alex, while Pauly D merely tried to keep her blonde friend placated. Didn't work. The never-named blonde barged in on The Situation and Alex in his bedroom and convinced Alex to leave. This week, The Situation runs into Alex again and invites her back to the house. She shows up with the blonde and a bigger blonde. The Situation does what any strapping young man would do -- he asks the 4'10" girl to ask them to leave. Snooki firmly but not overly rudely tells the two blondes to scram. Alex leaves with them, and one of them mutters something nasty to Snooki on their way out. Snooki barges after them, demanding to be insulted to her face. (Personally, I've never understood that impulse. I'd much rather be insulted behind my back.)

The Jets were hoping for a pass rusher at No. 16 and gambled on the most talented senior at the position in the draft with Quinton Coples. A natural 3-4 defensive end with the strength to collapse the pocket, Coples could be used in a similar fashion as how the Houston Texans played J.J. Watt a year ago. Rex Ryan will have his work cut out for him getting Coples' motor to run full bore, but this is a gamble that could pay off in a big way. The Jets took a similar gamble in round two with Georgia Tech wide receiver Stephen Hill at a much more palatable point in the draft. Hill has the size and speed to be a great vertical threat in an offense built on the running game and taking shots down the field. Of the Jets' later picks, third-round linebacker Demario Davis' size and explosiveness make him an intriguing developmental prospect. He could contend for a starting spot a year from now but he'll make his first impressions as a special teams star.

The ocean is our global heat reservoir and one of two major carbon dioxide sinks.

Bear, my daughter's 16-year-old Lhaso Apso, is almost completely blind and deaf. Since my daughter travels frequently, my husband and I often care for Bear.

The Proposition 8 trial is getting ready to start rolling, although cameras will not roll with the proceedings. The U.S. Supreme Court this morning issued an order blocking Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker's move to post the trial on a delayed basis on YouTube, at least for the first few days, while the justices consider the issue.
