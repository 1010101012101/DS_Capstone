The approach to public and affordable housing has changed drastically since Oak Leaf apartments were built. Housing authorities in urban areas throughout New Jersey have been opting to raze developments and replace them with single-family townhouses, arguing it’s often cheaper and safer than refashioning aging housing stock.

Komen’s Planned Parenthood debacle was a textbook example of weak leadership. It began with outside agitators pitching a battle that had nothing to do with stopping the 40,000 deaths to breast cancer that occur every year.

For years, Fuller has been a voice of reason and calm in an otherwise hysterical debate about the root causes of the contemporary logjam. He does not apologize for terrorism or violence in the name of God, but he has been consistently critical of the myopia of Americans about their own role in feeding the current hostility. And with a pedigree that includes years in high-level positions in the CIA, his critiques should carry unusual weight.

Studies such as this one do not establish whether sleep drugs are a cause of the increased cancers and deaths or whether, perhaps, those who are at greater risk of dying or developing cancer are simply more likely to seek a prescription for sleep problems. To establish such cause-and-effect relationships, clinical trials, which would compare subjects taking sleep medications against those taking a sham drug, would be necessary, said study coauthor Dr. Daniel F. Kripke, a professor of psychiatry emeritus at UC San Diego now affiliated with the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla.

Through the magic of someone else’s incredible amount of free time, they have spliced together all three games into “movies” that involve all the cutscenes and minimal gameplay to tell a feature-length story.

A: The government now borrows more than 40 cents of each dollar it spends. If the debt ceiling does not rise, the government would need to choose what to pay and what not, including benefits like Social Security, wages for the military or other bills. It also might delay interest payments on Treasury bonds. Any default could lead to financial panic weakening the country's credit rating, the dollar and the already hobbled economy. Interest rates would likely rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for the government and ordinary Americans.

The Cardinals first-year manager made only one twist to his top eight for tonight's game against the Cincinnati Reds and their righty Mat Latos. Tyler Greene will start at second base and bat eighth. Matheny explained that Greene is getting the start there tonight because he wanted to make decisions based on the night-day conclusion to this three-game series. The infielder who started today at second would not start tomorrow's noon game. Once he made that call, then it was just a matter of Daniel Descalso starting tonight or tomorrow.

Of course, no one does king cake quite like New Orleans. It's decorated in the colors of Mardi Gras — purple (to represent justice), green (faith) and gold (power) — as chosen by one of the city's first Mardi Gras organizations, or krewes. A token or trinket — usually a plastic baby symbolizing the infant Jesus — is hidden inside. Whoever finds the baby may be crowned king or queen of the party; more important, that person is responsible for bringing the cake to the next gathering.
The home of the Masters oozes decorum.

A difference from 2008: Air America, the liberal talk-radio network, was still operating then, albeit limping toward bankruptcy. Though that brand-name company is gone, along with all its behind-the-scenes turmoil, progressive talk as a niche is even stronger, Harrison said, with refugees from the network and others never associated with it, such as Stephanie Miller and Ed Schultz, heard on stations across the country, including locally on KTLK-AM (1150).

Because the villages tend to be at the bottoms of hills, while the Cotswold Way runs largely along the ridges, most days started with a climb. If we saw a monument on a distant hillside, we knew we would be standing next to it at some point. If there was an ancient burial mound, an Iron Age hill fort, a particularly scenic overlook, our route was sure to include it. We walked through pastures with cows by the dozens (including a bull or two) and sheep by the hundreds, following frequent way-markers that made getting lost nearly impossible. We were fortunate in the weather, with no rain to speak of, and never during 10 days of five- to seven--hour walks was there a morning we wished we could beg off, never a moment along the trail when we wished we were doing something else.

With such unusual needs available in a local store on Sunday morning, it seems realistic to expect logistics will provide for almost any need any time. (Oh yes, I know many people dislike Wal-Mart, claiming the company ruins small businesses, but I think we should remember that Walton did not invent such a concept. That was done years earlier by such local stalwarts as Famous, Stix and others who helped eliminate suburban business districts with their new suburban malls.)

Editor's note: Some of the best jobs require skills in math, science, technology and engineering, but local business leaders and educators are concerned that there will not be enough students interested in those subjects to meet demand. These skills are vital in Orange County, home to many rising and established technology companies. So, our Editorial Board has been showcasing local scientists and engineers, having them explain their work, and maybe get a student thinking about the kind of inventor or engineer he or she could become. This week, we showcase one such student. Bill Blanning coordinates this feature.
For now, the phone is off the hook -- as it was in 1994 when Sen. Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, derided NASA's "Martian chase" and successfully shut down its SETI -- "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" -- program. It would cost each U.S. taxpayer just 3 cents a year to fund the Allen array, according to SETI Institute Senior Astronomer Seth Shostak. But in this political environment, direct taxpayer support is unlikely, so the SETI Institute is trying to raise $5 million to reboot the array.

But Riascos missed a similar chance in the first half off a devious flick from Corona, and on two other occasions Pumas players cleared shots off the goal line.

CHECK THE FORECASTS. You can sometimes spot delays before your airline officially lets you know about them. That means keeping tabs on weather forecasts several days in advance for any airport you plan to use -- departure, hub, or destination. Especially check inbound arrivals at any originating airport where you plan an early-morning departure: If the plane can't get in the night before, it won't be there for your morning departure.

In its pragmatic wisdom, the court conceded "that there is no urgency in relocating the birds." It makes common sense, the court concluded, for the tiny flock of disabled wildlife to remain at O'Leary's Wildlife Center until the fate of SB 1126, a bill authored by state Sen. Mimi Walters, R-Laguna Hills, is decided in Sacramento. The legislation would grant O'Leary a long-sought permit to care for the birds under the authority of the Department of Agriculture, cutting Fish and Game out of the absurd psychodrama.

New features such as a media room and a billiard room with wet bar were added, and the kitchen was gutted. Since that renovation, Garrett has redone the office and the dining room. "It may have been built in 1930, but it has all the upticks of a modern home."
Top Picks Analysis: The Colts officially ushered in their new era of football with the entirely expected selection of Luck with the No. 1 overall pick, then proceeded to get their hopeful franchise quarterback a few playmakers to build around. Owner Jim Irsay and general manager Ryan Grigson made the right call at the top, as Luck is a strong-armed and very accurate passer with above- average mobility and an advanced knowledge of the pro game that's almost unheard of at the collegiate level. The cerebral young signal-caller will also have a familiar face to work with off the bat, with Indianapolis tabbing fellow Stanford product Fleener with the second choice of the second round. Adept at both getting down the seam and catching the ball in traffic, Luck's old and new teammate adds a needed weapon to the Colt's receiving arsenal. Fleener isn't much of a blocker, however, which prompted the choice of Allen in the next round. The 2011 Mackey Award recipient is a better in-line performer as well as a solid receiver that will allow offensive coordinator Bruce Arians to employ two-tight looks. Another pass-catcher was added to the mix when Indy traded up near the end of the third round for Hilton, a speedy and shifty slot receiver with dangerous open-field skills whose biggest impact as a rookie may be as a return man.

The appetizer size is filling; larger might be overkill.

On Thursday, the upstairs bar was closed before 11 p.m., and on Saturday, I was hardly finished with my second drink before they were already ushering everyone out the door.
"He got under the backboard a couple of times and couldn't get himself out," said Matta.
The sacraments are the seven liturgical rites - baptism, marriage and holy orders - through which Catholics believe they experience God's grace.
In June, Exelon documented levels of tritium in some monitoring wells that exceeded 1 million picuries per liter, which was five times higher than the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s standard of 20,000 picuries per liter. The DEP said Exelon has since provided evidence those levels have declined, although the levels remain above acceptable standards, including nearly 700,000 picuries per liter measured at two locations.
In reality, though, it was all pretty tame and just a close call. Jenny's goods stayed inside her dress.

The same cancer research agency lists alcoholic drinks as a known carcinogen and night shift work as a probable carcinogen. Anyone’s risk for cancer depends on many factors, from genetic makeup to the amount and length of time of an exposure.
Most people threatened with foreclosure never get legal help - already too broke to pay their house note, they can't afford it. In fact, most people facing foreclosure in Missouri never see a courthouse. The law here allows lenders to foreclose without court approval. Homeowners who want to resist foreclosure have to file suit asking a court to stop it.
Doctors, nurses and other staff have not received their last two paychecks. A source also said it has even begun laying off workers.
Lugo spent more than four months in jail in California last year after pleading guilty to grabbing a $275,000 Picasso off a San Francisco gallery wall.
So, if Kansas has no jobs to show for its seven years of subsidizing wealthy investors, who should be emulating whom?
Anderson and Wigget remain in the Webster County Jail where they await extradition to Oregon.
SUVs tend to ride higher off the ground compared with passenger cars, so cars can sustain damage to hoods, headlights, engine cooling systems and fenders in low-speed crashes with SUVs. Institute staff said the damages could be minimized by changes to federal regulations.
Said former teammate Ralph Terry: “Moose was a Yankee all the way.”
2. Robert Griffin III, QB, Baylor, 6-2, 223. Quality arm strength, 4.41 speed in the 40-yard dash and the Redskins are so excited he's on the way they've already dispatched offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan to Waco, Texas, several times to meet with him. His ability to throw, with accuracy, on the move to the left or right makes him a perfect fit for Mike Shanahan's offense.
And the action, as designed by Mr. Naranjo and his cinematographer, Mátyás Erdély, has a disjunct quality that borders on the surreal. Street battles break out without warning, setting thugs armed to the teeth against cops coming on like special-forces commandos. During lulls in the action, the Estrella gang's trucks and SUVs course through city streets in motorcades that avoid police checkpoints with the help of spotters on cellphones. It's impossible for Laura to know what's happening around her, what's going to happen next or who's on which side. In fact, she wouldn't have been forced into doing the gang's bidding if she hadn't enlisted the help of a crooked cop. "Miss Bala" is a portrait of a young woman who is at once terribly vulnerable and improbably brave. It's equally a vision of a vulnerable society on the road to anarchy.
Over the next 36 minutes, she said Senser's claim she was unaware she hit a person wasn't reasonable in light of the evidence.
Perkins has a lot in common with his mother.
"States are adopting the Nancy Reagan strategy—they just say 'no,'" he says.
"I don't know," English said. "We lost."
The three-star admiral was more than a figurehead throughout Ambition's trial cruise, sitting with the young aviators and monitoring the communications from the hangar bay as they flew their missions. Hoewing said he wanted to ensure that all the kinks are worked out before Friday's commissioning ceremony.
If you're not directly below the hole, whatever you think the break is, double it. Whatever you think the speed is, halve it. Putt with conviction, because if you miss, you're probably not going to be able to stop it near the hole anyway.
“You acted illegally and unethically, where the superintendent has presented you with reasonable candidates you’ve ignored,” Fisher said.
The letter to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus expresses a concern that the Navy might alter the rules "in an effort to exhibit to the public a larger fleet than actually exists." It is signed by Rep.

Johnston said he and Palin had used condoms but occasionally had slipped up. That's how Tripp was conceived, Johnston said.
For all the liberal lotus-eaters out there, especially Ted Stulz, once more, please try to follow the bouncing ball. Tax-the-rich schemes have never worked and have ultimately always reduced tax revenues. Why? Because the “rich” didn't get rich by being stupid. They will find ways to shelter or exempt taxable income, just as they always have.
Deep says Ford will notify the car owners to bring their cars in for a software fix. He said there is no safety problem with the cars. The automaker called the repairs a "customer satisfaction program" and said it was not a full-fledged recall. Deep said Ford reported the problems to a U.S. safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Harland, 35, is the baby of this group -- and arguably the drummer of the moment in jazz, generally. On Tyner's "Angelina," a Latin-tinged ballad, he took an astonishing solo, which began entirely on bass drum and drum rims. At first, he played really slow stretchy beats, like dub or hip-hop. As the beats accelerated, the clattering precision of his rim-hits conjured a timbales master, but then, still, there was the steady four-to-the floor bass drum that echoed Basie.
Ask a business owner where they find their hair, and they won’t tell. After all, it’s no small task to find the right supplier. In 2007, when Richardson, a former media ad saleswoman, started her business from her North Philadelphia home (www.indianprincesshair.com), she spent close to $20,000 searching for hair with the perfect weft, gloss and texture. Packs range in price from $265 for a 20-inch track to $340 for one that’s 34 inches long. And while it takes about two packs for a complete look, this hair, unlike synthetic kinds, can be worn — taking it on and off for style changes or washing — for at least a year. With traits like these, several Philadelphia beauty stores have been the targets of shoplifting and burglaries this year, the perpetrators taking their curly weaves with them.
Even many previously war-enthusiastic Republicans are pressing Obama to bring the troops home as fast as possible.
Like any good priest, Father Taso wanted little more than to serve his flock -- lead liturgies, baptize babies, build a new church for parishioners to call home.
— A 30-year-old Pitman man was arrested on active Washington Township and Glassboro warrants totaling $1,125 during a vehicle stop at 7 p.m. March 18 on Woodland Avenue. Ptl. Matthew Perry made the arrest. The man posted bail and was released.

Most of you are probably familiar with "Forrest Gump," the story of a simple man who changes people's lives - and history - through a series of chance encounters and weird coincidences. At the end of the movie version, Forrest delivers a touching soliloquy to his dead wife at her gravesite.
The chef roasts beef in its own fat so it has the richness of the accompanying foie gras, moderated with thick slices of porcini. He breads local abalone and places it on a platform of gooey rich pig trotters, surrounded by brown butter.
It wasn't until 1965 that Bandstand featured its first prominent African-American dancer, Famous Hooks. In 1991, Hooks told the Los Angeles Times, It was the most fun of my life. I met so many people and did so many things. Because of my image, I couldn't have been bad if I tried.
For vintner and host MacLeod, the fact that anybody would want to get together all these years later says something about the nature of people who come together to build the future -- and not just at Monsanto, though that's his frame of reference.
Center fielder Jay helped keep the score the way it was with a spectacular diving catch to his right on Lee to end the inning.
Connelly said it's unrealistic to have a peanut-free school. "It lulls the children into a false sense of security." But schools need to take steps such as having peanut-free areas for children to eat and reducing exposure of students to latex, perfumes or other allergens, she said.
"You'd be surprised how many people come in and they don't realize that it's THE Dick Vermeil," says Mary Sue Frediani, who is the tasting room manager and wife of winemaker Paul Smith. Frediani also is a co-owner of her family's Frediani Family Vineyard, which provides much of the fruit for Vermeil wines.
Friday's on-campus celebration of the impending move to the Big East Conference is indicative of the energy surrounding the program. Sumlin and Rhoades have been able to take what Art Briles and Maggard started to another level.
"They wanted to build up a bank of parts" before closing the plant, Rice said. But rising steel prices delayed those plans. The plant takes steel sheets and presses them into the shapes of door panels and other auto parts.
In hopes of not disrupting their children's education, many parents are holding on until the school year ends before uprooting their families.
For sure, Kyle has plenty of experience with the other schools. The SEC stops where his brothers played. There was Chas (Auburn), Ike (South Carolina), Clayton (Auburn) and now Johnnie, who is headed into his senior year as the place-kicking holder at Florida.
For many businesses, waiting 30 to 90 days for payment is a typical part of doing business. But car dealers tend to operate on credit. After a dealership sells a car, it usually has only seven days to repay the bank. So far, the federal program has approved paying $1.9 billion to dealers for 457,000 car sales, but it's handed out less than $150 million, Obama administration officials told the Associated Press.
Artest snapped and the sound could have echoed for years, rattling around with the thump of Rudy Tomjanovich's body landing on the Forum floor, a sound that still resonates nearly 35 years later.
The lead changed hands five times in the third quarter before Oregon City went on an 8-0 run to take a 51-47 lead into the fourth quarter.

"I'm so scared, I don't want to lose my family again," she said, clinging to her two children in a mosque in Banda Aceh, where hundreds of people sheltered.
It is the most intriguing subplot this mad March promises. When Williams left KU after losing to Syracuse in the 2003 NCAA championship game, he departed as the second-most successful coach in the program's history, behind only legendary Phog Allen. Now in his ninth season at UNC, Williams is the second-most successful coach in the program's history, behind only legendary mentor Smith.
At one point, he had a "breakdown," which he defines as putting his fist through the wall. But, for the most part, he got by until he could move out on his own.
Meaning, by the time he has completed his throw, he nearly has catapulted himself off the mound. Leyland isn't so concerned with the mechanics. He just wants Scherzer to "get it going. It's simple. We need him."

Economists expect home prices will continue to struggle this year before a modest recovery takes hold. The hardest-hit states, including Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, are inundated with foreclosures and short sales, when a lender allows a borrower to sell their property for less than what is owed on the mortgage.
“From what I’ve researched, you want, ideally, four square feet per bird in the enclosure and 10 square feet per bird in the run, assuming you don’t let them out in a fully-fenced yard,” she said. “I’m looking to design a five-foot-by-10-foot long footprint in my backyard for the run and elevated coop.”

The Markers had a penalty corner with two minutes to play in regulation but came away empty.
“He’s the best defensive player in the National Football League,” Ayanbadejo said. “He’s irreplaceable. There aren’t many guys out there who can do what he does for us. But we have a lot of talent on defense and we will be able to bounce back.”
They sure buy them if they’re made by Adele. "21" sold close to 6 million copies — the biggest single-year sales figure since Usher’s "Confessions" in 2004. (Three and a half million of those copies were physical CDs — an otherwise endangered species.) The album nearly tripled the sales of Lady Gaga’s "Born This Way," which arrived amid a landslide of hype and was hawked for 99 cents on Amazon during its release week.

He wouldn't elaborate on the facts of the accusation, pending the ongoing legal process.
Naturally, the obvious first question on Monday was: Who fired the shots? One name was on everyone's lips. But we were dealing with a minor, and The Plain Dealer has a long-standing policy of not naming kids who are in trouble until they are charged as adults -- and then, only after authorities have confirmed their names.
I agree with that statement, and I think once again people are getting carried away with their reactions to Flacco’s comments. Flacco might not have articulated it in an ideal way, but he was just saying that he believes in himself, and the nature of his job requires that he carries himself with confidence.
The average purse - or prize paid to horses - is about $252,000, and the authority is chipping in nearly half that amount, Samerjan said.

Despite its vocab-building potential, Wordie makes little effort at instruction. The site provides no definitions of its own and lacks any means for prescriptivists to purge the site of nonsensical words. Each word has a hyperlink buffet pointing to related entries from eight different sources. These include Google, Merriam-Webster, Wikipedia and the frighteningly named NinjaWords, which bills itself as "a really fast dictionary … fast like a ninja."

The change will mean a new pickup day for some city residents. But the administration isn't naming the wards or saying when the changes will take effect as it lays the groundwork for a citywide transition. Emanuel banked on roughly $20 million in savings in his budget by doing away with the garbage pickup based on the city's hodgepodge of misshapen wards.
The documents come from a confidential proposal by Felix J. Dawson, a former Goldman Sachs and Constellation Energy executive, to effectively buy out Baltimore Racing Development. Whether his plan, which involves a $3.3 million infusion of cash from his investment company, Wilkes Lane Capital, would be enough to right the finances of the race is hard to say. But it is clear that the only way to salvage the race — and the significant public investment in it — is for a new owner to take over and to bring in managers with actual experience in running an event like this one.
In advance of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit next month in Chicago, Karzai has been highly critical of his Western patrons. This week, he said NATO's intelligence failures were primarily to blame for a wide-ranging spate of coordinated attacks in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and elsewhere. He also demanded specific financial commitments that he said must continue once most Western combat troops are gone.
“When I didn’t hear from them for a few hours,” she writes, “I naturally assumed Jax was in the ICU, after thoracic surgery, or hooked up to a heart-lung machine.” Eventually, Sam calls to reassure her, grateful for her calm and her restraint. That we know differently is part of the trick of the narrative, the way Lamott reveals the outer and the inner life.
Similar plays of flavor and texture emerge on just about every dish, whether it's grilled salmon ($21) washed in a orange sauce with braised fennel and basil, or chicken ($21) served two ways - the breast cooked sous vide style, and the confit leg placed on potato puree with pistou, ramps and natural juices freshened with lemon.
For all of last year, the economy grew 2.9 percent, the most since 2005. The year before, the economy had suffered its worst contraction since World War II. All told, the economy produced about $13.4 trillion worth of goods and services in 2010, a record.
The Tadasana festival, named after the "mountain pose" in yoga, was the brainchild of yoga industry business developer Tommy Rosen and world music producer Fabian Alsultany, who also co-produces the Twilight Dance Concert Series on the Santa Monica Pier.

Capt. Ryan Jean wanted to perform well on the Army's psychological evaluation for soldiers. But he also wanted to answer the questions honestly. So when he was asked whether he believed his life had a lasting purpose, Jean, an atheist, saw no choice but to say no.
Tribal Council time! Everyone is confident that they aren’t the one going home tonight, which Jeff finds unbelievable. So who’s wrong? That would be Mike, who is, indeed, blindsided. (I totally have to admit that I already had Christina written down while waiting for the votes to be read, and I had to go back and change it. Maybe that’s just because it’s what I wanted them to do.)
"A lot will boil down to the judge's decision about whether to permit Edwards' experts to testify," Rich said. Such testimony would probably help Edwards by emphasizing the complexities of the law.

Track programs already have started their indoor seasons. It looks like the paths of two prominent area athletes, former Festus standouts Alyssa Allison and Brittany Borman, will cross this spring. Allison is a sophomore distance runner at Arizona State - she transferred to the Tempe, Ariz., school a year ago after a semester at Arkansas - and Borman, who started her college career at UCLA, is a junior at Oklahoma. The ASU and OU teams are scheduled to be at the Arizona State Invitational on March 25-26 and at the Sun Angel Classic (at ASU) on April 8-9.
As recent history goes, that is pretty good for a program without an indoor track.

Paterson’s CUMAC pantry “has been asked on several occasions to accept clients from other pantries because they have run out of food,” says executive director Patricia Bruger.
Mr. Hollande attacked the pact as soon as it was signed, promising to renegotiate it to make it more growth-friendly. His criticism of the pact has gained traction as the deteriorating euro-zone economy pushes more national leaders to call for a different balance between austerity and growth.

Braly said the company would be pursuing similar government contracts in California and other states.

The show was founded three years ago by "American Idol's" Simon Cowell, who didn't bother to hide his horror when Boyle, dressed in a modest, cream-colored dress with a sash at her waist and a contestant's badge around her neck, walked out on stage. She told the judges that she hoped one day to be as successful as Elaine Paige, the renowned British singer and actress. She gave her age and then nervously wiggled her hips after some people laughed. Cowell rolled his eyes. Another judge, Piers Morgan, winced. The TV camera zoomed in on scornful faces in the audience.
"It will certainly take a few days for people to get used to the detours," Zlotnik said.

The other aspect of the build to this year's show that could be problematic was the high volume of matches built around competitors being kept apart physically.

The outcry seems quaint now, but only because we've become used to tawdry tales. Some of Shaw's play feels dated, but a lot of it retains an indignant ferocity and gleaming sharpness. Unfortunately, it's nowhere to be seen in a production whose edges have all been dulled.
The numbers are ugly. The Blazers, who led by 18 points early in the third quarter, just went to sleep offensively in the second half, when they scored 28 points, their low in any half this season ... by six.

It's hard to know how the unfortunate ankle injury suffered Monday by point guard Darren Collison -- he stepped on a cameraman -- will affect the Pacers. And it remains to be seen if Indiana -- which returns home for the next two games, starting Thursday -- can still make a series of it.
After Manningham’s near-TD was ruled incomplete, I had a handful of people tweeting me, saying they still didn’t understand the rule. The best I can explain for you is the play isn’t over when he gets his second foot down because he still has to complete whatever act he’s currently performing. When a receiver is upright, that act is taking another step and/or holding the ball for another beat. (See Lions wide receiver Nate Burleson’s touchdown from Sunday.) In Manningham’s case, he was falling. That meant he had to go to the ground and hold the ball the whole way. He didn’t do it, and it was correctly ruled an incompletion — twice.
She wore a vintage white dress with pale pink Converse high-tops. A diamond necklace matched her glimmering earrings and what appeared to be a very expensive wedding ring on her left hand. Her extra-long press-on nails wrapped delicately around the microphone. It was easy to see why Del Rey came off so poorly in front of the television cameras. She makes awkward gestures with her hands and doesn't quite know what to do with her lanky body. She is also terribly self-conscious.

The agreement will still have to be formalized, then ratified by the league's owners. Also, the National Basketball Players Association -- which was dissolved as the players' negotiating body -- will have to be reformed, and its approximately 430 members will have to approve the deal. The sides also will have to agree on so-called "B-list" issues that will be part of previous CBAs -- such as draft age and drug testing.
Rev. James Reilly, pastor at St. Michael's Church, was asleep when the fire began. Two other priests in nearby rooms were awoken by a fire alarm and tried to get Reilly out of his room, but the door was locked.
Chicago: LHP Chris Sale's longest of three starts this season is 6 2/3 innings, and he's made at least 100 pitches in each outing. Hoping to help his command, the White Sox moved his bullpen session back a day to Monday. Most starters throw their bullpen session two days after their last start, but some, like LHP John Danks, throw on the third day. Sale will now try that routine. ... LH closer Hector Santiago is still searching for his screwball, so the team's video coordinator dig up video of former left-handed screwballers like Fernando Valenzuela and Willie Hernandez. Santiago converted four of his first five save chances, but the White Sox believe he'll be tougher if he rediscovers the screwball.

For the past three years, checked luggage has been a huge profit maker for air carriers. The industry collected more than $3 billion in baggage fees in 2010, compared with just $464 million in 2007, the year before the legacy airlines adopted a fee for the first checked bag. And for three years, the industry has essentially had it both ways -- collecting our money and then losing our luggage without any meaningful consequences.

øOn Wednesday, a survey by payroll provider ADP of private employers estimated that companies added only 119,000 jobs last month. The ADP report has deviated sharply from the government's figures in the past and isn't always a reliable indicator.

It was a magical experience-or rather, not magical, but holy. We were fortunate to arrive when the building was nearly empty. The serenity inside was palpable, as if you could feel the centuries of prayer gathered around you, as if countless mumbled petitions and heartfelt cries had seeped into the very stones of the place. I remember thinking, "This is how a church is supposed to feel," before my eyes even consciously took in the gorgeous mosaics depicting scenes from the life of Mary.

The Ravens will sign kicker/punter and undrafted free agent Justin Tucker, who hit 40 of 48 field goals during his last two seasons at Texas. Nothing against Tucker, but I’d still expect them to bring in a little more formidable and veteran competition for Billy Cundiff. The New York Jets signed Josh Brown yesterday to push the inconsistent Nick Folk for the kicking job. I would be surprised if the Ravens didn’t do something similar. Maybe, that means signing Shayne Graham again. Either way, you not only want to push Cundiff, you want to have some insurance if the problems that he had last year persist into the preseason.
