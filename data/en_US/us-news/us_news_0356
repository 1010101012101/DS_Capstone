Another impetus to prescribe is the changing nature of medical practices. Physicians spend more time now than ever waiting on the phone, filling out paperwork and jumping through a labyrinth of regulations from insurance companies in order to be allowed the opportunity to treat their patients. Additionally, insurance companies, via their reimbursement plans, discourage healthcare providers from spending the time necessary to assess and treat childhood mental health problems. The average doctor's visit now wraps up in less than 15 minutes. It can be quicker and easier to medicate symptoms than to do a full assessment.

It is fact that an offer was made before the season began. The team believes it was a very fair offer. Forte and his agent obviously disagree. Some of the numbers that have been reported about the offer have been inaccurate. As David Haugh reported, the truth is it was an offer with $14 million in guarantees and worth an average of $6 million a year. There has been very little movement since the season began that I am aware of. The Bears chose not to do their negotiating in the media. Sometimes, a little public disclosure might help their cause.

A special twist: Keep an eye out for Heller's Petit Verdot, a rare Bordeaux blending grape that can be tough to vinify on its own. Theirs is surprisingly approachable and fresh, one of few truly successful varietal bottlings. That might be the result of a dramatically long hang time; the grape is typically picked late in November, often the last fruit to come into the winery, yet lands under 14 percent alcohol.
øSome same-sex couples could come out ahead by filing separately, particularly if they're in higher tax brackets, says Mark Luscombe, federal tax analyst for tax publisher CCH. Filing separate tax returns also allows same-sex couples to shift income to the lower-earning spouse, although that's not an option in community property states, he says.
In the fermentation process, grape sugars are converted into alcohol. If a wine ferments to dryness leaving no residual sugar, it has a higher alcohol content than a wine whose fermentation is arrested in order to leave behind a little sweetness. In other words, most off-dry wines have inherently lower alcohol levels because of how they are made.

But as one of America's richest men, Warren Buffett, has famously been quoted as saying, "There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich, that's making war, and we're winning." Mr. Obama has been gleefully advocating the "Buffett rule," which holds that, in view of the fact that the man's secretary pays a higher tax rate than he does, anyone making $1 million or more a year should be required to pay an effective rate of at least 30 percent on their income.

THE REFORMS
Cassell Jr. has certainly welcomed the idea of being more a point guard than his father was at Florida State, where the older Cassell once said, “This team doesn’t need me to be the set-up man. This team needs me to score points. If I’m the set-up man, we’re not going to win a lot of games.”

They're part of a long list of bills vying for attention at the 2012 Legislature, which convenes Wednesday.While meat-and-potato issues of schools and health care are supposed to dominate the 2012 Legislature's agenda, no self-respecting posse of western lawmakers would be content to stop there. Bills about wolves, cougars, guns, liquor and gambling will make at least guest appearances.
OK, it's probably two-and-done with Sullinger. In the forward/center's two games before Wednesday's huge effort (22 points, including the game-winning basket, 18 rebounds) at Northwestern, he came off as an effort player who simply did not give a very good one. With a larger sample size than afforded last year, NBA scouts must realize Sullinger is not big enough to play inside in the NBA.

The Jones family has become leery of outsiders, who are angling with their own agendas. Former Jones coaches, parents, strangers, and media are all greeted this week with, "Can I call you back in five minutes?" while the family huddles and tries to figure out who can be trusted, and who cannot. Because fans, coaches, friends -- everyone, it seems -- wants something from Jones.
"As I was doing research on Westboro Baptist Church I was made aware of the fact that they have called off pickets in favor of radio interviews.

What if they showed up anyway?

In 1982, three 12-year-old boys in Mississippi possessing video equipment and total naivete about the arduous task of feature-film production decided to make their own version of "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Unbelievably, not only did they complete the film -- six years later -- the "Raiders" redo is remarkably fun and impressive given that its budget was probably less than a Hollywood film crew's weekly coffee bill. A great feat of enthusiasm and resourcefulness, this "adaptation" is reportedly charming audiences all over the country.

So we became friends. Such close friends, in fact, that I handled all of Sparky's personal business affairs. Neither Sparky nor I liked the sound of the word "agent." We tried "manager" for a while.

Byron seduced a litany of swooning titled ladies, and when he attempted to break off his relationship with Lamb because of public opprobrium, she disguised herself as a page boy and brought to his room a lock of her pubic hair as a sort of calling card. Nothing quite compares, though, to the gothic drama -- O'Brien compares his domestic life to something out of Edgar Allan Poe -- of Byron's ill-fated marriage. All the while, he carried on an incestuous relationship with his half sister, and when wretched wife and sister were both pregnant, he threatened to move his actress mistress into the home they all shared. On the night his wife gave birth, he roamed the home's galleries, waving the pistols he habitually carried and proclaiming himself "in hell." He subsequently threatened wife and child with death. Later, during his Italian exile, when Mary Shelley's stepsister bore him a daughter out of wedlock, he routinely reviled her and ignored the child.

Almost anytime we turn a desire - even a good and legitimate one - into a need it's something that typically and quickly becomes an entitlement, in our minds. And that means we have the right to demand it of someone else. Or demand that society approve of it. To make matters worse, when we refer to something we think we need, we tend to think we have no control over the situation.

She offered to check around. Then agonizing hours passed, and I used the time productively to regale my captive audience of co-workers with the tale, only to be regaled right back with other Oscar-related stories. One guy's brother married the granddaughter of actress Jane Wyatt, who my friend thought had won an Academy Award but turns out it was three Emmys instead. (Do three Emmys make one Oscar?)

The Baltimore insurance salesman heartily endorsed his gluten-free diet recently while lunching at Sweet 27, a cafe that has similarly done away with the protein that's become the latest nutritional boogeyman — the new carb or fat or red meat.

Here lies the secret behind "The Borrowers": Mary Norton was nearsighted as a child and wasn't diagnosed until she went to boarding school. Later, talking about herself in the third person, Norton confessed that recalling her life before glasses made it easier for her to imagine a race of tiny people, living close at hand and among the ants: "She saw through their eyes the great lava-like (sometimes almost steaming) lakes of cattle dung — chasms to them, whether wet or dry.

Hefner now faces the big task turning the company around. Playboy's most popular years are well behind it -- the magazine enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s. Today it faces competition that ranges from other men's magazines such as Maxim to far racier content available on the Web for free.

Tobacco companies are contributing more than $20 million to the campaign to defeat Proposition 29, outspending the pro-tax campaign — which is supported by bicycling star and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong — by more than 5 to 1. We couldn't disagree more with their reasons for doing so, and it makes us uncomfortable to agree with them at all, but from our perspective, this initiative takes perfectly good tax money and misspends it; we'd rather see an alternative proposal that hikes the cigarette tax but spends the money more wisely. We recommend a no vote on Proposition 29.
"When you charge someone, particularly a public figure, you essentially ruin their life," said Rutgers School of Law Dean John Farmer, a former New Jersey attorney general whose former law firm represented Doria. "It's almost as if it's the charge that matters, not what eventually happens. I think there wasn't enough sensitivity to that reality when these cases were brought.

A city staff review of the 11 Orange County cities that give housing developers the option of paying a fee said San Juan's fee is less than half the county average and represents just 10 percent of the city's total developer fees. Members of the city Housing Advisory Committee said other developer fees could be responsible for San Juan's perceived high cost of residential development.

Before leaving Siem Reap, however, I headed for Le Tigre de Papier cooking school to get a handle on Khmer cuisine. I put my foot in my mouth — before even taking a first bite — when I mentioned the influence of Thai food on Cambodia's culinary offerings. Heng, who runs the cooking course, scowled. "Let's get one thing straight: We influenced their food from 9th to 13th century when Thailand was under our rule. Khmer food came first, and the Thais copied from us."
