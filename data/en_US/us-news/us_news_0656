The night before Eid usually families get together to celebrate "night of moon", ladies adorn their hands with Hina, clean houses, cook special dishes and get ready for the celebrations. We wear new or best clothing on the day of Eid, eat something sweat before leaving for the prayers and afterwards celebrate with family and friends. Gifts are given to relatives and especially children; depending upon the local cultures it is usually cash (very much appreciated by teens). We visit our relatives, friends and acquaintances and say "Eid Mubarak" (blessings of Eid). It is also recommended to visit the graves of our relatives to pray for the departed souls.

When you have this talent bank, you know a lot more about the workforce, so you can start skill-marketing to companies. We found that we were getting a lot of job orders from IT companies. We knew that we had a lot of people who had skills in IT. We put together a very focused job fair. We recruited all the people we knew with IT skills and tried to match them. It was great. We had 20 companies. The feedback that we got was that the companies were ecstatic about it. Our goal is to put only qualified folks in front of the employers. I think that is a huge advantage and great service because now you have eliminated three or four steps in the hiring process for them. They had to be referred and prescreened.

Broadcasters end shows all the time, of course. But in the 38-year-old Emerson's case, his career has paralleled a period of seismic shifts in how people consume information. When he started in radio, broadcasters were still going after the largest audience possible.

In May 2010, a group supporting the switch to a traditional city presented the town with 1,700 signatures -- more than enough to put the city question to voters. But the Town Council didn't do its part to get the question on the Nov. 2 ballot as the group had requested.
Some of this, of course, is an inadvertent byproduct of larger trends. Much of it, though, is a deliberate effort to hide the truth.

Win expectancy charts aren't perfect, but they can be a good way to confirm (or dispute) what we may already know intuitively.

In a way, this was the most impressive achievement of the year. Doing this show is not just “a bear,” as the old theatrical expression goes — it’s a lion and a tiger and a bear, oh my. But despite the challenges of mounting such an elaborate production, the state’s best children’s theater company turned in first-class entertainment, from the top of the Wizard’s hot-air balloon down to Dorothy’s ruby slippers.

My wife does not work and is covered by my employer's health insurance plan. I am 60, she is 53. If I retire in five or seven years and go on Medicare, what does that mean for my wife?

It goes like this: When human consciousness expands, for whatever reason and with whatever stimulation and even if you can only measure it in hairbreadths, when our nasty habit of harsh judgment falls away and people begin to get a little bit, you know, lighter, there is always, as sure as there's someone who hates the sunrise, a clampdown, a recoil, a desperate need by the terrified and ever-paranoid conservative sect to, you know, put a quick stop to this so-called awakening ASA-damn-P.

Employees and patrons at the St. Louis Galleria knew Frank Romeo Jr. So did the bad guys.
But he also has shaped not only the way films are made, but how they're released and distributed. "Jaws," a summer movie about a shark terrorizing a beach, was the first film to have what's known as "wide" distribution -- that is, it opened all over the country on the same day, as opposed to rolling out from city to city over time. And its stunning success turned summer from a movie wasteland to prime time for blockbusters. For this he receives both credit and a surprising amount of blame.

In general, the front label of a wine bottle should tell you where a wine is from and what grapes it predominantly is made from. So, if you see an Oregon pinot noir labeled "Willamette Valley," then you know the grapes came from that region, which is known for pinots. Words like "reserve" and "vintner's select," can denote higher quality, but that's not a given, especially on New World wines. Ditto for medals and other awards, which have become quite prolific.

Perhaps not surprisingly, I've spent a lot of time with our leadership team reviewing our plans, asking questions, and evaluating our prospects. Bill Ford was completely candid about the challenges we face, so I came into this with my eyes wide open. We have some very big decisions to make about what kind of business we need to become. And, as you well know, this is an extraordinarily gut-wrenching time at Ford Motor Company, particularly as we become smaller in some of our core areas, such as North America. Some very good and loyal people are going to leave this company between now and next summer, and that's going to be tough on everyone.

PDAs aren't dead. They were just waiting for another technology to come along so they could become useful. I got it half right when I wrote back in 2000: "Handphones. Cellphones. Mobiles. Whatever you call them, this is where a lot of your computing is going to be done in the future. The first move in this direction is combining your Palm-type personal organizer with your handphone." (That was written only four years after I bought my first cellphone and got weird looks in the office -- partly because I hung it off my belt, which admittedly was not a good look.)

The pastor sent a pre-printed postcard to our home the following week, and that was the last she heard from them.

So order tickets now and come on out on Friday. When visitors finish following the pumpkin path, they will be able to visit a haunted house showcase at the end of the tour, but no one is required to enter its spooky halls, that’s optional. The showcase highlights scenes from classic horror movies thanks to the talent of actor and set designer, Bill Ward, who has added a theatrical touch to the traditional haunted house theme.
I remember struggling to articulate the experience I regularly had of drawing closer to God through the Daily Office, and especially in praying the Psalms. I finally blurted out something like, "You're right, there are times when it feels like I'm just reading words on a page, and the connection to God is not there, at least not emotionally. But there are other times when the Psalms feel like they're coming straight out of me, like they're saying what I needed to say but would never have been able to put into words myself."

Don't fear fat. For healthy brain development, include unsaturated fats (avocados or very thin spreads of nut butters, if approved by your pediatrician) and some saturated fats (full-fat cheeses are best before age 2). But avoid trans fats in processed goods.
If Roy voluntarily retires, he forgoes his salary and can't return to the NBA for one season. I don't see that happening. But if the three-time All-Star were forced to retire for medical reasons (a league-appointed physician would have to rule Roy is medically unfit), there's an interesting loophole. With Roy medically retired, the Blazers could potentially get salary-cap relief after a one-year waiting period.

The refining business slumped in 2009 as refineries paid more for oil but were unable to pass the costs along to customers. Now, demand for gasoline and diesel is healthy enough that refiners can command better prices for their products, helping to offset higher oil prices.
No joke. We hope.
Even if she wasn't our homegirl, I'd be rooting for Irene right now, because in the thick of all the reality-TV posturing that happens on shows like this, she seems genuinely modest, and struggling with giving herself credit for what she's done. In short, she seems like a real person, not someone who has watched way too many hours of reality TV and has studied how to grab maximum camera time.
So, no: the Rangers don’t need to have anyone stand up between now and tomorrow night and say something like, “We’re going to go in there and win Game 6. We’ve responded all year. We’ve won games we’ve had to win. We know we’re going in there to win Game 6 and bringing it back for Game 7. We feel we can win it, and we feel we are going to win it.”
Schlumberger is buying Smith International for $11 billion in stock in a move to diversify its product offerings and better compete with rival Halliburton Co. Investors viewed the deal as a sign that demand is likely to grow for fuel as the global economy recovers.
But that was with Chantel Cox and eight others removed from the pool of test-takers. If even one of them had taken the test and failed, the school’s pass rate would have slipped below the target. Failures by all nine would have driven the pass rate down to 82 percent — 11 points lower than the previous year.

The Hawks are the only team that didn't record a shutout. That stat, though, meant much more weeks ago when the Hawks played poor defensively and Crawford failed to come through with timely saves. It's lost some luster because the Hawks and Crawford have been better.
The 22-year-old was asked simple questions about his life, such as "Is your father's name Alexander?" He was told to answer "yes" or "no" by thinking about one or the other of the imagined scenes about playing tennis or navigating streets or his home. For five of the six questions, his brain activity matched the correct answer.
Garden volunteers worked hard at that location to get it off the ground, Lewis said. A volunteer from Dodge Nature Center tilled the soil. Others put up lightweight fencing to keep people from casually walking through the plots. Wood chips were put down to delineate 24 plots measuring 10-by-10-feet, and the city established 26 rules for how the individual plots would have to be maintained. When opened to the public, they were all spoken for within a week and a half, Lewis said.
"Late last night, someone told me you needed to be 18 to open a new account," Tich said. His 18th birthday won't be until June. The Pepper Pike resident said he had to wait up overnight anyway because he couldn't leave his friends who were old enough to get new phones.

In fifth place in the Horizon League coming in, losers of three straight, including one at Youngstown State, where the nearby Steelers' third trip to the Super Bowl in six years made the event an afterthought -- Butler is still the team that gets everyone's best shot. How else to explain students at Wright State and Valparaiso storming the court after beating a diminished Butler team this season?
A: It will have nothing to do with their regular-season record without him. Any move that dramatic would come as a result of the playoff result, and even then I'm not sure they could ever deal Dwyane based on his package-deal signing with LeBron James.
Tonya Billips, 46, who lives next door to the unit in which Leon was killed, was dumbfounded.

I'm curious about the difference between the two surveys. Are men more likely to say they're employed when they're not? Or are men more likely to be self-employed, a group that sometimes gets undercounted in the payroll survey?
Instead of doing something about it, Jean goes to pieces, which Wilton telegraphs with over-bright chatter, a frown fixed in concrete, trembling hands, a desperate pass at Wilkinson's character, and finally full-blown hysteria. It's harder than it looks, like playing drunk.
"This really comes down to the distinction between employment and training," George Wentworth, a senior staff attorney at NELP, said Wednesday. "We recognize that workers were doing this voluntarily, and that it was and continues to be a tough labor market, training is much more narrowly defined. This looked much more like employment."

At the emotional and physical center is Jones, who sits at a desk onstage reading the vignettes. Friday night's topics ranged from Amsterdam's red-light district, child abuse and McDonald's Happy Meals to grief, love and wonder. Jones is compelling when recalling his late partner, Arnie Zane, who died in 1988, at age 39; a minute later - literally - with deft comic timing Jones recounts the tale of Edward de Vere passing gas during an audience with Queen Elizabeth I.
Growing exports and robust domestic demand are expected to boost Poland's economic output this year by at least 4%, a rate that far outstrips the EU average.
NEW YORK: Amare Stoudemire had a small muscle repaired Tuesday and will not play for the Knicks in Game 3 on Thursday of their first-round playoff series. The Knicks announced that Stoudemire met with a hand specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, a day after suffered a cut to his left hand when he punched the case surrounding a fire extinguisher after the Knicks' 104-94 loss in Miami. The Knicks are listing Stoudemire as doubtful for Game 4 on Sunday.

The "diet" he created lived on after his death. Some of my friends remember their moms getting HCG injections in the 1970s. Then, the practice waned, as diet trends do.
"They play a lot of zone, so they try to really make you prove it from the outside," Gross said. "They play the lanes pretty well. They have really good size and they utilize it well. They run the floor well in transition, so that's going to be a key for us, to try to slow them down a little bit."

If the state removes the homestead exemption from a property, it is up to Baltimore to actually collect the money, and that's no sure thing. The reason many of the houses in question are boarded up is that they are in foreclosure — that is, the owners are not paying the mortgage and already stand to lose the house, whether they owe money to the city or not. In other cases, the owners have concluded that the investment necessary to make the homes livable isn't worth it, and being forced to pay property taxes at a higher rate isn't likely to improve that calculus. Either way, the city could wind up with the deeds to yet more vacant properties on top of the thousands it already owns.
In addition to trying to prep the regular 53-man roster for Sunday's game, players are often asked to fulfill different roles during the week. Brown is a running back, but because of his versatility, he has played the role of Patriots WR Wes Welker this week. He's also played some safety.

What the leaders do: They help people and organizations become more energy independent by building public and private partnerships to accelerate change and build healthier communities.
Boehner faces challenges from the opposite corner. Die-hard conservatives have been ascendant in the House Republican caucus for years, and they don't consider Boehner a true enough believer. He lost a leadership position in 1998, and he began his most recent leadership climb in 2006 not as the conservative favorite but as the plain-spoken, collegial alternative to a House Republican leadership team that had been embarrassed by lobbying scandals. A "fresh face," Rep. Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, said at the time.
Lundeen, who also sings tenor, has regularly performed as a section leader and on horn at Trinity Church in Red Bank — and at churches in Bordentown, Cranford and Bloomfield. "What you're really hoping for is that one gig jigsaws with another," he says. "You figure out, 'I have enough time to do a 6 o'clock service here, an 8 o'clock there.

We flavored our cream puffs with lemon zest, but you could use any extract or zest, or leave the dough plain. You also could use other berries in place of the strawberries.
"We're going to make some plays, but stay away from the bad ones," he told Manning. "And if that means he has to take a sack, which he has loathed to do, now, he hates to do that, but if that's the best thing on that play, take it. Throw the ball away, do those things, and then you're going to make enough plays but when the situation is such — the odds of you completing that pass (are bad) don't do it."
"We've got injuries, which doesn't really help. Some guys have got to pick them up," said Kennedy, who allowed six runs and six hits in seven innings with two walks and six strikeouts. "But guys are going to get healthy, guys are going to start hitting better. We've got to pick each other up. That's what a team does."
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the answer is in the question. I think that question is spot on. What you find as you travel around the country is that there's certain regions that are starting to gain expertise in biotech, or they're starting to gain expertise in advanced battery manufacturing, or they're starting to gain expertise in a particular industry which requires a particular skill set. And if we can get businesses to partner with local community colleges or local universities and have them help to design the training process for the jobs that already exist, it's a win-win.

Legend has it that Ixcateopan, in the southern state of Guerrero, is where loyal Aztec warriors smuggled Cuauhtemoc's bones after his execution on the order of Hernan Cortes in 1525.

Although this contemporary play does not have any direct connection to Monty Python, its irreverent spirit is much the same. Nothing is, er, sacred in this sort of spoof. If the monks' robes place them in a medieval setting, their speech patterns and behavior would be at home in a late-night comedy club.

The A's saved themselves in the 13th with a two pretty defensive plays. Catcher Kurt Suzuki caught pinch-runner Lillibridge well off second base, then shortstop Cliff Pennington chased down Alex Rios' double that skipped into the Oakland bullpen and made a quick throw to Sogard, who then relayed to Suzuki just in time to get a sliding Gordon Beckham.
According to its first Federal Election Commission report, President Barack Obama's re-election campaign raised $47 million over the past three months -- plus helped the Democratic National Committee take in another $38 million. That haul tops the announced $60 million goal for the combined appeal, and the chunk for Obama's campaign alone nearly matched the current record for an incumbent: George W. Bush raised $50.1 million in the third quarter of 2003. Impressive as the numbers are, that pace for the next six quarters still won't hit the $1 billion target that some observers have predicted Obama could raise. But keep in mind, there could be plenty more where that came from: Obama's 15,000-page filing lists more than 552,000 with an average gift of $69. That's a lot of people who can keep writing checks.

It builds on the generational obsession with fries. Sunshine Tavern's are crisp and firm, forceful enough to stand up to cheese and pork sausage gravy. (Kid brothers think they'll live forever.) Not only are the fries impressive, but they accompany the majority of the restaurant's most interesting main dishes.
State law allows a provider to care for a maximum of four children without a license. But Missouri is one of just four states that also permits an unlicensed provider to care for an unlimited number of children who are relatives, regardless of the children's ages.

The rubber game is Sunday at 1:05, with Dan Child (4-2, 1.93) facing UCLA’s Zack Weiss (2-1, 3.48). Although Fry stopped the bleeding - the Beavers had lost seven of their last nine Pac-12 games and four in a row - this one is just as crucial as the Beavers try to claw back up the standings.
A New England sort of charm colors the atmosphere in the trim, cozy space that unfolds behind this Chagrin Falls landmark.

This is one of those bills with a fiscal impact — potentially costing the state at least $4.9 million in lost revenue — so the governor likely won't be rushing to sign it.
Family vacation: Bear Valley on Highway 4 east of Arnold. Some miss out on Bear Valley because of its location, and there isn't much around other than Dorrington (one very cool restaurant at the Dorrington Hotel) and Arnold. But the lodge, cabin rentals and a family-oriented resort can make you fall in love with winter. Case in point, advised Al Saracevic: "I'll never forget the time I skied all the way back to the lodge with my 9-year-old because the roads were covered in snow. She'll never forget it either." We voted an honorable mention to North Tahoe and a combo trip where you stay at Granlibakken (best breakfast in Tahoe, excellent sledding) and then ski Homewood. (209) 753-2301, bearvalley.com
Taylor was the most blessed and cursed of actresses, the toughest and the most vulnerable. She had extraordinary grace, wealth and voluptuous beauty, and won three Academy Awards, including a special one for her humanitarian work.

But she was afflicted by ill health, failed romances (eight marriages, seven husbands) and personal tragedy.

Zidane had already ended his international career once in inglorious circumstances, but that was nothing compared to how he finally left the game. Persuaded to rescind the retirement he announced after France was eliminated from the 2004 European Championship, Zidane helped carry his country to the 2006 World Cup final and a meeting with Italy at Berlin's Olimpiastadion. Zidane had already said the game would be his last in professional soccer and he put France ahead with a seventh-minute penalty kick. A tense game was headed toward a penalty shootout after Italy had tied the game when, seemingly without provocation, Zidane turned toward Italy defender Marco Materazzi and planted a head butt on his chest. Zidane was sent from the field in disgrace, passing within touching distance of the World Cup trophy he was now unable to play for. With Zidane unavailable, France lost the shootout 5-3.

Old-school gamers may fondly remember "Kid Icarus" from the 1980s, but if they play it again as adults, the adventure doesn't hold up. The classic shows its age.

The German finance ministry feared the commission was trying to establish a precedent for centralized European public borrowing, through EU bonds. That would imply Germany, Europe's strongest creditor, subsidizing other nations. Instead, Germany insisted any aid must come via loans by the individual euro-zone members to a stricken country. That way Berlin, writer of the biggest check, could control the process and force a wayward recipient to reform itself.

She said a final decision on hiring a company to find the next director may be made at the board's January meeting.
Such initiatives quickly became obsolete. And just when strong jobs programs were needed most, Ireland instead was forced to dismantle its state training and employment agency, Foras Aiseanna Saothair, or FAS, because it became mired in a multiyear spending scandal starting in 2008. One FAS program cost the government €392 million in 2008 but had only 7,736 participants.

Q. Dear Honk: My sister and brother-in-law bought an 18-foot fishing boat and trailer from a guy in the San Diego area. When they brought it over to our house to show us, my husband noticed that there wasn't a bracket or license plate on the trailer. When they asked the guy they bought the boat from about this, he said as long as it had current CF numbers, which it did, that it was legal to drive on the road.

Davis, 25, had spent his entire career with the Rangers, who drafted him in the fifth round in 2006. By 23, he was the Rangers' Opening Day first baseman and hit 21 homers in 2009 while batting .238. The left-handed hitter has been in an elevator between Triple-A and the majors since. He has hit .250 with three homers in 76 at-bats for the Rangers this season.

Chris Overbeck, who owns the Hudson restaurant with his wife, Teresa, said he had been eyeing this store's location for two years, but back then the rent was too high and management didn't want to budge on the price — until a year later. Overbeck, who with a partner owned another Beef's at Hudson Avenue and Little Road from 2001 to 2006, knows the area well.

Shelved next to the Game Reserve was the 2009 Hestia Chenin Blanc from Washington state's Columbia Valley, priced at $13.99. This also has an interesting label with a raised golden face of Hestia, the goddess of the hearth and the protector of home and family. The Hestia chenin blanc received 92 points from the Wine Enthusiast. Like the Game Reserve, this is a dry chenin blanc, but not bone dry. It also tastes of pineapple and honey but has more citrus notes than the Game Reserve. However, I didn't find it quite as lively and crisp. The Hestia has a 13 percent alcohol level and a dense, syrupy mouthfeel. It also would pair well with flavorful and spicy food.

We are down to nine seconds on the clock in the fourth quarter. The score is tied at 49 after Rob Gronkowski trucked his way into the end zone. The Giants have the ball on their own 4-yard line after a disastrous kickoff return. Manning drops back to pass, and Vince Wilfork and Rodney Harrison (who unretired and was signed to a free agent revenge contract minutes before kickoff) burst through the offensive line, each with a clear shot at Manning for a game-winning safety, when both are distracted by the Lucas Oil Stadium scoreboard operator’s decision to put one of Peyton’s Sprint commercials up on the Jumbotron. While the defenders are busy laughing at big brother’s fake mustache, Eli laterals to Nicks, who unleashes a 40-yard option pass to Cruz, who catches the ball upside down while balancing one-handed on the helmet of a Pats defender, then flips himself forward and sprints toward the end zone, leaping over the hoodie that Belichick hurls on the field in disgust as the clock expires.
I even had a fabulous grandma name picked out. "Grammy K" had a nice ring to it. Grammy reminds me of a music award and I'm a singer, so it seemed perfect. Plus it sounds a little younger and hipper than "grandma."

We suspect the GAO will find what scientists studying the Big Muddy have suggested over and over again: The river needs room to roam. It needs more room to spread out.

We have a very solid and up and coming player with a ton of potential in Nic Batum. He won't ever be a 20 and 10 guy every night, but he is only beginning to tap his upside. Nic is very young (still) and is a much improved player from last year. Players like Batum are important to any championship calibre team. Will have somewhere between 12 and 20 million in cap space to do some real damage with. Although quaity FAs are a bit on the scarce side this year, Portland should be able to add 1-2 high quality starters to the Aldridge/Batum core through free agency.
