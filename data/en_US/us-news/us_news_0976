The thought of Marino erasing that with one flick of his wrist had the soldout Stadium crowd in a state of quiet apprehension.
Obama has made it clear that he is serious about reducing the number of U.S. troops -- and, even if that weren't his starting point, he faces pressure from within his own party to begin a drawdown soon. The most immediate danger to Obama's re-election would be a primary challenge from the left by Feingold or some other disenchanted dove, and the president would like to head that off. By comparison, criticism from the right could actually help him; the Afghan conflict is deeply unpopular, and Obama might benefit from casting his Republican opponents as champions of a bigger, longer, more expensive war.

John Freeman, editor of the literary journal "Granta," believes "there is no art form which can compress a dynamic so complex into a single narrative or a form." Like Junod, he credits nonfiction writers for "beginning to grasp the long context of these events, and how it is so much bigger than New York City or Osama bin Laden." But he also defends "Falling Man," DeLillo's brief novel set in part at ground zero on the very day, as the "one book which captures the eye of the storm."
Groves is urging cities and states to promote the census and improve upon rates in 2000, when about 72 percent of U.S. households returned their forms. If everyone who receives a census form mails it back, the government would save an estimated $1.5 billion in follow-up visits.

Given the mind-boggling complexity of the possibilities, Higdon's achievement in her concerto is considerable, with deft handling of tone color, texture and rhythmic transitions in a unified piece that flows easily in a rush of uninterrupted energy over a single 23-minute movement. The music is difficult to characterize -- it turns on a dime from sumptuous string-rich passages to sparse and sparkling episodes to percussive displays with the ghosts of Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa hanging out in the background.

øInstead of giving players a selection of mini-games to explore, Rhythm Heaven Fever opens with just one mini-game. It's a golfing game about timing your swing to hit golf balls that are tossed to you. The balls lobbed by the little monkey are easy to hit; but instead of just letting you warm up this way, the mini-game also introduces "fast balls" thrown by a mandrill monkey and interchanges these two pitchers. Achieving the passing score needed to unlock the next game will probably take repeated practice; so you will want to steel yourself to frequently see the "Try Again" screen. And there is no progress bar on the screen to let you know how you are doing.

Jeff Barker: There sure were a lot more memorable moments for the defense than the offense during the spring game. It looked like the stronger unit. I like the defensive line with Joe Vellano and A.J. Francis returning. The linebackers could be strong in the new 3-4, particularly if Kenny Tate can come back from knee surgery. “Depth-wise, the safety position is where we need some help,” defensive coordinator Brian Stewart said recently. The fans had to be rattled by watching the offensive line surrender 13 sacks. You just don’t expect your quarterbacks to be so harrassed in a spring game. It may be driving Randy Edsall crazy that people keep asking him about the dozen Maryland players who left the program after last season. Here’s how a reporter phrased a question during the most recent ACC teleconference: “How concerned are you that you could experience some growing pains or difficulties at quarterback in the fall when Danny O'Brien's out there leading Wisconsin to another Rose Bowl?” Think the ball coach loved that question? His reply: “I'm just concerned aboutC.J. Brown and Perry Hills and Caleb Rowe.”

Most famously, the country's government fought a six-year legal battle with the Met for the return of the Lydian Hoard, a collection of goods looted from a burial mound in western Turkey. (It, too, had passed through the hands of Zakos.) The Met agreed to return the objects in 1993 after evidence emerged that museum officials had been aware of the material's illicit origins and sought to hide it. To the chagrin of Turkish authorities, soon after its return a key piece of the treasure was stolen from the local museum to which it was returned.

Coach's comment: "You know, I just feel my coaching staff, assistant coach Denise Darre and coach Eric Palmer were great. I certainly wouldn't have won anything without them. They did amazing work as a team. I mentioned this before, part of the reason why I coach boys is because I was a sports psychology major and I believe in positive reinforcement.

But "The Trinity Six" is also solidly in-genre. Sam Gaddis is a perfect thriller character: He's handsome, smart and perhaps a tinge mysterious. "With his crooked good looks, Gaddis would have been a natural for television, but he valued his privacy too much." He's weak around beautiful and smart women and dutiful to his 5-year-old daughter. He can defend himself with a gun, but he's usually a humble Everyman who understands that people have "better things to be spending their hard-earned cash on" than his books. Yet faced with major money problems, Gaddis becomes heroic, wielding his occupation as one would a sword: "It was the only solution. He would have to work his way out of the crisis.

4. Bottlegate -- Displeasure at an overturned fourth-down conversion in the red zone in the final minute on replay led to a long delay, while beer bottles, hurled by angry fans, decorated the turf. Had Quincy Morgan either (a) caught the ball or (b) not preened and made the "first down" arm signal, the Browns would have either (a) converted or (b) got the next play off before the replay official intervened.

We could go on.

There's no question payroll taxes are constitutional, because there's no doubt that the federal government can tax people in order to finance particular public benefits. But requiring citizens to buy something from a private company is different because private companies aren't directly accountable to the public.

"And the choristers were all standing out there and they were kind of teary and I said, What's the matter? We just closed a great show!' And they said, This is our final performance at the Lyric Theatre.' And I hadn't even thought about it."

A caller who identified himself as James, an Akron small-business owner, discussed some of the tax write-offs he uses as a small businessman, and said larger businesses "game the system" by writing off things like parties, food and clothes.
Their one-bedroom apartment was barely big enough for two, so my son and I stayed at a hostel — another thing I never intended to do with my child. But the Circus Hostel defied my post-college experience of shacking up in cheap rooms with strangers who talked all night. The top floor of the five-story building held comfortable, IKEA-décor apartments that had views of the TV Tower, a Cold War leftover that, at 1,207 feet, remains the tallest structure in Germany.
There may come a day when asking people whether they are gay is as innocuous as asking where they live. But we're not there yet. The revelation of a judge's sexual orientation continues to spark controversy (as in the case of former Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker, who heard the Proposition 8 case), and questions about people's private lives are not yet routine.
"That was our best defensive quarter in a long time," Nuggets coach George Karl said. "Our energy to start the third has not been good generally. Tonight we accepted the criticism and played very well."
The daughter of sitar great Ravi Shankar, Jones exploded out of the New York City jazz scene in the early '00s and built a steady career on albums that elegantly nodded toward jazz, country and pop in a manner that merged well with public spaces seeking a hip (but not too hip) backdrop.
Yost's office found that the Columbus charter school, where Shye was treasurer, got about $100,000 from the state after it no longer had any students.

A. Home remedies seem to be a bit scarce when it comes to caterpillar — sometimes called worm — controls in bougainvilleas. Well, I guess you could try to catch the moths in a butterfly net or smack them with a fly swatter but you probably have better things to do. How about a natural control instead?
Romance and friendship
"There's definitely more awareness now," said. "Five years ago, the term was not on the radar. People don't give you a blank look anymore." Then she added: "I'm surprised how many people, even people in horticulture, think a rain garden is a water garden, a pond," she said. "Then they say they don't want a pond in their front yard."
Clendenin argued that the marijuana she grew was distributed to authorized medical-marijuana patients through dispensaries. The court found that Clendenin needed to know the patients.

But several council members agreed with the group that the fight against graffiti has to begin at home - and has to involve parents who aren't afraid to punish their children for doing wrong.
Most peculiar among Mickelson's career to date is that he has never achieved No. 1 in anything. He has not been No. 1 in the world ranking or on the PGA Tour money list. He has not won the FedEx Cup in its five years of existence. He has never been voted player of the year.
"He's been amazing this year," Kielbaso said. "Last year, Kyle was with him every day, so Kyle kind of took the lead. This year, Cliff knows that he's got to do it. He had a great attitude last year. But this year it's even more professional. He's here early every day, he stays late, he wants to do extra."
Kuntupis says he's remained sober since entering drug treatment shortly after his January 2007 arrest. Peals says she'd been sober for about 1 1/2 years, but had a relapse last summer because she was so depressed about the lengthy custody battle.
Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, fending off questions about whether she used her Native American heritage to advance her career, said today she enrolled herself as a minority in law school directories for nearly a decade because she hoped to meet other people with tribal roots.
3. When Luck enrolled at Houston's Memorial Middle School and went out for the football team, coaches put him at defensive end. It didn't take long for them to see the error of their ways. "The first day I showed up, they gave me lineman pads and I was probably too embarrassed to ask anyone to let me throw the ball so I could show them I could do it," Luck told the Houston Chronicle.
Fresh & Green's, which replaced Superfresh last July and advertised itself as a hybrid of a traditional store and an organic market, "did a subpar job" and chose the wrong community, Ilardo said.

"Winter always comes," says Weimer. "There's still a lot of season left."
Whinna said police were able to identify Henning as the suspect within a half-hour of the hold-up, in part because of descriptions given. Perhaps the most telling feature was a tribal tattoo band around his neck.
"I thought it would be great if kids got to use the beds. It's better than having just grass out there," owner Lois Hankins said.
Caliche (22-4) took advantage of Springfield's futility on the way to a 38-16 halftime lead. After guard Max Duncan hit two free throws that put Springfield (18-7) up 4-2, the Longhorns converted only 6-of-39 possessions into points going into the intermission. In a stretch in the first and second quarters, the Longhorns converted only 3-of-31 possessions into points.
(She won an Obie, among other honors, for her work.) Here, Patrese D. McClain assays the enormous role with style, versatility and, let's be honest, pure nerve.
Given all that, it's clear that we're on to a growing success story - not only in California but in Washington, too. The next challenge is to make great Grenache in enough volume to become a familiar sight on shelves. But if that could be accomplished for Pinot Noir - using, let's be honest, a range of dark arts - there's no reason that easygoing Grenache can't rally where its Rhone-native siblings have struggled.

"My K-Cup is not just a solution for environmentalism," but it also allows people to buy whatever beans they like best, said Molly Kelley, a Keurig spokeswoman. Keurig's parent company, Vermont-based Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, has developed a reputation for environmental awareness and has instituted composting and solar power. A third-party certifier, Fair Trade USA, said late last year that Green Mountain is the No. 1 buyer of fair trade coffee globally.
This week, it just seemed like the natural way to do this project. I started writing it on the new iPad simply because it's part of the process of testing (and because I've found a 24 hour donut shop with incredibly good free WiFi). But as I went along, I felt no motivation to move it to my MacBook. The screen was crisp and comfortable. The 4G-speed mobile broadband gave me greater freedom of movement. I had 10 hours of battery, so I never needed to rush through my work and I never needed to hip-check that guy who seemed to be headed towards the table that adjoins the donut place's lone open power outlet.
Two of those five — in Hampstead and Ocean City — are waiting for the state comptroller to approve their brewing licenses, an agency spokeswoman said. Union Craft Brewery, in the works in the Woodberry section of North Baltimore, plans to release about 1,000 barrels in its first year after it starts brewing in May, said co-owner Jon Zerivitz.

"I don't think you can stop progress," said Sergio Gonzalez, who owns a small restaurant in town and is developing his own tequila brand with his family. "There's a lot of good things and bad things that come with tourism, but I've seen small towns grow and grow because of it.
Every year, it seems, the story about Cleveland Public Theatre's upcoming season contains the words "most ambitious." Why mess with tradition? The 2011-12 season for Cleveland's alternative theater is the most ambitious yet, with a jam-packed schedule that includes seven world premieres, six of which are devised theater.
Captains starter Felix Sterling allowed two runs on two hits in five innings, walking two and striking out four. Francisco Valera pitched two innings, allowing one run on two hits, walking one and striking out two. Mason Radeke (1-0) got the win, pitching two scoreless innings, striking out two.
The value-added approach focuses on how much progress students make year to year rather than measuring solely their achievement level, like the API, which is heavily influenced by factors outside a school's control, including poverty and parental involvement. Value-added analysis compares a student with his or her own prior performance, largely controlling for outside-of-school influences.
Two years ago, environmental and consumer lobbyists clashed with utility advocates over state legislation that would have furthered Ameren Missouri's plans to develop a second nuclear plant in Callaway County.
"I don't see anyone galvanizing people like they did for Mike Huckabee," said Steve Scheffler, president of the event's sponsor and a leading social conservative activist in Iowa. "And I'd be lying if I told you that can change in one event."

Remember that time is your enemy. Older relatives won't be around forever, and family histories might die with them. If a family member is not nearby, call or write them to learn more about their health history.
"When you're so young, you haven't yet realized there's limitations to what humans can do. You think this 16-year-old guy sailed around the world. Why can't I? For me and my family, it was never all that shocking or that big a deal. I'd been raised around it. It was almost normal."
The straightforward Albona serves four-star dishes from the Istrian Peninsula. That strip is now part of Croatia, which explains the bottles of Terzolo vinos on the wine list and a few menu items involving sauerkraut. Its historic connection with Italian culture explains the other 90 percent of the menu (pasta, seafood, braised veal shank, Adriatic fish stew, $6 to $29).

"Blunderbuss," which debuted on the Billboard album charts this week at No. 1 with about 138,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan, was particularly unplanned. When the rapper RZA didn't make it to a scheduled session at White's studio, White decided to start working up some songs of his own. It wasn't until well into the process that those in the room — a collection of session musicians and others — understood the project taking shape.
Pine and Columbia streets and Highland Drive, which run along or within the square's 6.4-acre site, were built and outfitted earlier this year.
"We upgraded to curtains with a string," Karen said. "It was really a big deal."
No refunds have occurred since then. But that's partly because the Hancock Amendment forced a change in public policy. In response to swelling state revenue, legislators enacted a variety of new tax breaks in the mid- to late 1990s. Then the economy dipped in the 2000s, leaving a large gap between the revenue ceiling imposed by the Hancock Amendment and Missouri's actual revenue.

"They're great out-of-hand food. They're clean, easy and a small commitment of calories. Plus, the frosting-to-cake ratio is just right," she says. As a baker, she loves the creativity they offer. "There are endless options to what you can do with cupcakes," she says. "You can mix and match, and add new toppings and fillings to basic recipes."

To combine the oil with chevre, cut the log into ½-inch to 1-inch rounds; don't worry if they crumble. Place them in a pretty glass jar or refrigerator dish with a lid. Pour the cooled olive oil over the cheese. Serve with crusty bread or crackers, dried salami slices and olive tapenade, or marinated sun-dried tomatoes. Refrigerate any leftovers.
Four of the five people charged in the plot to kill Jessica Sears have been convicted and three are to be sentenced later this month -- Mallorie Wilson-Strat, 25, of Ferndale; David Clark, 31, of Detroit, and Christina Sears, 26, of Ray Township. Bashar Mansour, 23, of Warren is scheduled for trial Tuesday on a charge of first-degree conspiracy to commit premeditated murder.
"The bottom line is that players are misled into thinking that their labor will fully pay their way through school, and they are definitely earning much less than their fair market value," he said.
The 24-year-old center played in only eight games before being sidelined again.
They were right then - and now.
And it starts with lots of portable toilets.
The market for fuel-efficient vehicles should be more competitive than it was four years ago. Since 2008, GM launched the Lordstown-built Chevrolet Cruze compact and the Sonic subcompact; Ford began selling the Fiesta subcompact and Focus compact; and Hyundai launched a new Elantra compact that was good enough to win the North American Car of the Year award at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January.
1, Combine oil and blue cheese in small bowl or a glass measuring cup with a handle. Using a fork, mash about 1/2 of the blue cheese into the oil, pressing fork against side of bowl or measuring cup (the oil will be bluish when you finish). Stir in the vinegar, garlic salt and ground black pepper. Add kumquat slices; set aside. This recipe will make more than you will use. Dressing can be stored for one week in the refrigerator, well-sealed in a nonreactive container.

Injera is the base of Ethiopian cuisine and serves not only as sustenance but also as plate and utensil. The pancakelike bread is made from teff, a cereal grain that grows best at high altitude. It is cooked in a hot pan that causes the side in contact with heat to form spongy dimples. Those dimples help soak up savory sauces.

I thought I was just going to meet him and one of his friends, but when I arrived, he was sitting at a table with about eight students. Some were in high school and a few were about to start college. When I got there, he told me how much it meant to him when I helped him, and now he was going to do what he could to help these students. It was one of the most touching things I've ever experienced. By the way, he got his Ph.D. in May, and he is already doing a lot to give back to the community.

Wacky Wacky West (Mayfair, $35; 2-4 players; age 10+; 45 min.) Ignore the strenuously cartoonish Old West theme, and there's a perfectly handsome little family game lurking here. Players lay tiles to extend the streets, railroads and the river from the corners of the board into the center of town; the goal is to keep the developers from running over the buildings you have a secret stake in. That involves a nice mix of strategy, bluffing and luck - just the right balance for intergenerational play.
"For people who want to see a certain show at a certain time and know exactly where they are going to sit, they should definitely make those reservations before they leave home," he says.

Oregon finished with 168.5 points. USC was second with 156.
They won. But really, everyone did.
SMS is still huge in most parts of the world and will remain so: It's simple, it's immediate, it doesn't require any extra downloading or fiddling, and the limitations of its character length have created a new form of communication that everyone is familiar with (no need to begin "Dear so-and-so," no elaborate sign-offs, no need for pleasantries. To the point and businesslike, but with the potential for coquettishness.)
Monday, Anheuser-Busch InBev's U.S.-listed shares fell 2 cents, or less than 0.1%, to 72.62 after the Belgium-based beer brewer reported a year-over-year increase in first-quarter earnings revenue that just missed analyst expectations.

And be prepared to see Dunham, who looks nothing like the women we see in most TV shows. That is to say, she might pass muster as the nerdy gal-pal in a traditional sitcom. But when was the last time we saw the lead female character in a TV show -- comedy or drama -- look so average? Dunham's not skinny. She doesn't appear to have had a nose job, Botox or lip injections. All of her body parts -- and we get a good look at them -- appear to be factory originals.

If I throw a bad pass, I shake it off."

The Blazers coaches and players talked after Game 6 about how "draining" the season was. How "emotional" things felt. How they worked hard, and battled, and struggled together. And as they talked about these things I wondered if they realized who it was they'd forgotten.

As a writer and preacher I rely on the power of words, but as a priest I sometimes have to be reminded that music, gesture, and ritual are just as important--arguably even more important--to the experience of worship. It is possible to talk all the mystery away, and when the mystery is gone, so too is our experience of sacredness, prayerfulness, and awe.

As he guided his boat across the surface of Cross Lake, state conservation officer Cary Shoutz studied the lakeshore house in front of him. It was 6,900 square feet of living space crammed on a 23,000-square-foot lot with a lawn sprawling downhill. "The elevation is going to drain all the runoff into this channel here," said Shoutz, a 22-year veteran of Minnesota's lakeside enforcement wars. "It's legal. But it would have been nice if they could have left natural growth near the water and built a catch basin for the runoff. ... They had a chance here to do something really special, and we didn't get the message to them, obviously."

Your dentist can evaluate whether bleaching is right for your teeth, since different kinds of discoloration respond differently to whitening. For example, bleaching works for most stains caused by age, smoking, and regular coffee or tea drinking, but it may not be effective against discoloration that results from tetracycline use in children under age 8. (Tooth discoloration can also occur in a child whose mother took tetracycline while pregnant.) Finally, even if you choose the over-the-counter route, your dentist can advise you on the relative merits of the products available.

The orchestra, to these ears, sounded much the same as it did in the Georg Solti years. That is to say, it remains a formidably brawny ensemble. These musicians eat red meat and lift weights, sonically speaking. The brass section is still an almost terrifying presence.

The ease with which these sections coalesce and cooperate is remarkable. There's no shoving or elbowing. Everyone has his or her place and doesn't have to shout to be heard.

_ CULTURE AND ARTS: Don't worry, the debt crisis isn't going to shut down the Louvre in Paris or the Vienna State Opera House. Culture will play a central role in European life for the foreseeable future. But how much of it should be financed by the government? That's a question being asked in many European capitals as budgets are being tightened. As part of its austerity drive, Spain's new conservative government has eliminated the Culture Ministry as a self-standing institution, merging it with education and sports. A program to subsidize Spanish cinema — which made a name for itself around the world with Oscar-winning directors such Pedro Almodovar — has been scrapped. In Sweden, the government has decided to gradually dismantle a subsidy program that provided lifelong income guarantees for artists seen as particularly important to Swedish culture.

Fielder didn't fit. Yeah, I believed that. The Tigers already had two $20 million-a-year players. They already had a great first baseman, signed through 2015, and a big-time designated hitter, who is out injured this year but is signed for two more years after that. Prince Fielder didn't fit with the Tigers, just like he didn't fit with the Yankees or the Red Sox or the Phillies. Yeah, I believed that, and now I can't figure out why I did. Because here's what I should have believed: Mike Ilitch is 82 years old, and he's every bit as determined to win a World Series as Arte Moreno is in Anaheim, every bit as determined as the Steinbrenners are in New York. And if Prince Fielder was the guy who might put the Tigers over the top, Ilitch and his baseball people were going to try like heck to make it fit."

Clear Channel Communications hasn't fired Limbaugh, as it certainly could and should, but at least some advertisers and radio stations are jettisoning him. That's how the marketplace should work.
The animated Disney film, on which the musical is based, handled the mix of grownup themes and kiddie fare with aplomb; the stage version isn't always as successful. It can't help but be jarring when against a backdrop of exquisitely designed costumes, flowing dance moves and that hypnotic African chanting to suddenly have a squawking bird crack a one-liner. (Though it must be pointed out that Mark David Kaplan, as the bird Zazu, expertly squawks and sputters like a classic Vaudevillian ham.)

"The Cubs will be heavenly in '67ly!" Ernie Banks enthused. Sounded right to me. That was the year my parents first allowed me to go to the ballpark without parental supervision. It was day baseball, they figured, and walking distance, safe enough if I went with a friend like Billy Foster or Casey Dinges. Little did the adults know that their darling fourth-graders would spend a chunk of their summer days in the company of bartenders, guys just off the graveyard shift, unemployed layabouts, lesbians (though we recognized them only as nice ladies who knew a ton about sports and came even when it wasn't Ladies Day), and pimply faced, beer-swilling juvenile delinquents who always out-raced me over the bleacher benches to batting practice balls. These fine fans, the source of much valuable information about life, were soon to be immortalized as the Bleacher Bums.

ø•There's also the famous Sports Illustrated "cover jinx," in which athletes featured on the sports magazine's cover go on to experience bad luck.

"It was hard for us to let him go after '09 but the problem with Strick was that he played great but when he was in there he had some injuries that kept him out so there was a durability question there and that's one of the reasons we drafted Kyle (Wilson) and we had Drew (Coleman). I think that was one of the reasons he was let go.
The same is true of Cuomo’s proposal to build a convention center and casino in Queens. Genting, Cuomo’s preferred company, would pay the $4 billion, but only if New York gives it a regional monopoly on gambling, plus tax breaks. This isn’t healthy competition, but a protection racket.
Still, the Wolves jumped on the Warriors from the start, building a 21-point lead late in the second quarter. But in the second half the Wolves cooled on offense and stopped defending.

Phillip chooses "In the Midnight Hour." You know all the imagination and creativity he displayed during the first song? It's vanished. This is bar-band territory here.

The Columbia is a massive resource here, and many, like Neal, are frustrated that the state doesn't allow farmers and others to do more with it.

Among the four formidable lead roles — each equally important throughout the implausible, tragic plot of Shakespearean proportions — the highest praise goes to soprano Michele Capalbo as noblewoman Leonara and mezzo-soprano Nancy Maultsby as the gypsy Azucena. Both alluring, dramatic voices (referring to rich and robust vocal qualities that easily project above the sound of an orchestra) brought heft, fullness and emotion to Verdi's many sumptuous arias, as well as the pianissimo lyricism and powerful outbursts their parts demand.

However, with the new year came a new effort in that pursuit. It is something different for our readers, because it combines three complementary forms of newsgathering and delivery: the regional reach and authority of The Plain Dealer; the local connection of the weekly Sun newspapers; and the interactivity and immediacy of Cleveland.com on the Internet.

It is more of a passive defense in which the body erects barriers against invasion. Conventional wisdom says that allergens share some structural similarities with these parasites that mistakenly cause the body to direct an immune defense against them.
