But much will depend on the price. Analysts estimate a tablet could cost $500 to more than $1,000, and that may or may not include having to pay for monthly data access.

This one pulls out all the tricks: delaying payments until the next fiscal year ($3.4 billion from K-12 and higher education), liquidating assets ($1.2 billion from the sale of 11 state-office properties), legally dubious maneuvers (tapping $1 billion from early childhood programs funded through a tobacco tax; taking $1.7 billion from redevelopment agencies), politically dubious maneuvers (counting on Republicans to support a vehicle-license-fee increase of $500 million), dipping into the reserve ($570 million) and counting on windfalls that might or might not happen ($700 million from the federal government to help fund Medi-Cal).

Political scientists tend to rely on one of three types of prediction methods. Veteran forecasters, notably Charlie Cook and Stuart Rothenberg, combine data with impressionistic analysis, drawing on decades of experience calling races as well as interviews with hundreds of candidates. In the purely statistical camp is Nate Silver, who gained attention for his computer model that accurately predicted the 2008 presidential election and has developed a similar tool for House races. And a number of political scientists have produced mathematical models that, for the most part, treat the election as a single race.

He went for the ball and, much as the play ended poorly, props to Brady for keeping two hands on the ball to secure it.

Rabbani, it should be noted, was Afghanistan's most prominent Tajik, not a Pashtun like the vast majority of the Taliban. There are those within the Taliban who may be prepared to share power with the non-Pashtun minorities in the future -- but plenty of others who are probably not. Some analysts therefore think Rabbani's assassination was a cynical attempt to eliminate one of the few credible, ethnic opposition leaders ahead of the eventual, inevitable peace deal: a blow for future Pashtun hegemony rather than an assault on the peace process per se.

The measure, which passed 76-0, is intended to attract out-of-state companies to New Jersey, and could have a hefty price tag. Rate analysts said a 2008 version of the bill that applied just for manufacturing companies would mean $77.5 million less in revenue.

Travelers increasingly rely on these search systems to locate their best deals. Overall, they do a very good job with airline tickets, and they're starting to get it with rail options in Europe. For now, the biggest omission is in hotel prices. No sites I know require that hotels add in any mandatory "resort," "housekeeping," or other separate fees in their all-up quotes. At best, you get some sort of "extra fees may apply" notice that doesn't help anybody -- except, possibly, the agencies' lawyers. Clearly, the omission of mandatory add-on fees seriously distorts the price comparison process. The OTAs can and do provide all-up, fee-inclusive quotes for rental cars, and I can't see any reason why they don't do the same for hotels. Let's hope for some progress in this area soon.

A cow manure-based compost, mixed with various plants and aged, could then be added to the soil. The biodynamic gardener is always looking for diversity and balance.

I couldn't tell you our record. What I can tell you is that sports brought us close together. Also, that my father, a minor league baseball player in the New York Mets organization, could take a bat and ball and hit a pop-up higher than any human on the planet. He hit the baseball so near the moon and with such accuracy that Dad could put the bat down, pick up his glove off the ground, smile at me, and then circle beneath the ball and catch it.

Sherrie, Wheeler is claiming Hartig is taking a trip to Boston at taxpayer expense, but did you know that she is paying her own way for the trip and expenses? Did you also know that Wheeler went on the very same trip, only to Tampa, last year and charged the taxpayers $3,000.00? Do you also support that, Sherrie? IF you had heard the school board attorney, he told the superintendent that he misspoke and that he NEVER told Andrews there were three votes to terminate. Besides, Andrews guessed the wrong three names when he thought he was being smart in naming three board members. Andrews is leaving next year because he MUST leave due to his DROP program terminating.

This Japanese department store in giant Ala Moana Shopping Center is a giant in its own right and another unusual place to grab a meal. You can visit the store to buy electronics, but once you venture onto the food floor, you might be distracted for hours. Shirokiya has dozens of things for customers to taste: sliced octopus, seasoned squid with eggs, fried sardines. OK, so maybe none of these appeals. But there's also a snack bar and deli with such things as ramen noodles, sockeye salmon and great tempura. We tried the salmon bento box ($6.70) and curry udon ($7.45). Both were hits.
The cap will be the first limit on debit card fees. Currently, banks negotiate such fees with merchants. A big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop because it handles more customers. The fees are typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.
It takes a lot more than lithium-ion batteries to power electric and hybrid cars.
The sequester required by the supercommittee's failure would abruptly wring about $110 billion in new spending from next year's budget.

First, at the behest of state Senate Republicans, the "compromise" offers Ohio gamblers a juicy tax break on gambling losses -- and not just losses racked up at the four Ohio casinos, but losses racked up anywhere (Indiana or Las Vegas, say) and not just losses from casino gambling, but also losses on horse-race bets; lottery tickets; "you name it," a Taxation Department spokesman confirmed.
"During these difficult economic times, supporting American workers, their families and our small businesses must be everyone's focus," the president said in a statement.

It's not clear that Israel is convinced, but President Obama deserves credit for his forceful argument that the Jewish state shouldn't precipitously attack Iran's nuclear program. He has also effectively rebuked American politicians, including his Republican rivals, for "beating the drums of war." At the same time, Obama has committed the United States to a "military effort" to block a nuclear weapon — a newly muscular formulation of his long-standing commitment to take no option off the table.
Azarenka hit a deep return to set up a slam and break her Polish rival's first service game, and went on to hit 14 winners and held for love to wrap up the first set.

Money was used for security, but it was also used for other spending. A 2000 congressional report found that the federal government would spend $1.3 billion in and around Salt Lake City.

Cutler also suffered a knee injury in the NFC championship game, making improvement in the offensive line the team's top offseason priority. The job that Tice did with the group he had is one of the reasons he is a hot coaching property who deserved the raise he received. What about Martz? The Bears reportedly paid him in the $1 million a year range when they gave him a two-year contract last year. They were not bidding for his services and the chance to get back in the league and prove he's not a rogue coordinator probably meant more to him than the compensation.

We would have ordered dessert, but we had to allow time to walk to the theater. You need a walk after that kind of meal anyhow.

"My daughter grew up fishing," Morrow said. "I used to go rabbit hunting with beagles and she'd do that, too. Friends are more important to her now, but she remains pro-hunting and pro-fishing, and nothing will ever change that."
In our case, from our campsite we followed a trail that spanned the river on a beautiful wooden bridge, then climbed uphill to a connection with the main trail. From there we trekked nine miles through forest and meadows before turning around at vast Blayney Meadows, a lovely spot beneath the ramparts that on this day was very green; three horses from the ranch were out grazing and exchanged sniffs with our dog.
Organized in 1830, Latter-day Saints were persecuted from their earliest days for their doctrine and support for polygamy, which Mormons renounced in 1890. A mob assassinated founder Joseph Smith in 1844, sending Mormons fleeing into the unsettled Mountain West. Theological differences with other faith groups — about scriptures, the nature of God and heaven — provided fodder for anti-Mormon bias over the years. Christian groups challenged the Mormon assertion that the church is part of traditional Christianity. One such group, the Utah Lighthouse Ministry, operates just a few miles from Temple Square, the Salt Lake City complex at the heart of the faith.

Context: To Frog's Leap proprietor John Williams, merlot is the perfect wine to accompany foods for which pinot noir is too simple and cabernet sauvignon too intense. Specifically, the richness and plushness of his merlot, coupled with the wine's bright acidity, makes it a splendid companion for roast chicken, braised veal shank and grilled portobello mushrooms. "It's the perfect wine with salmon, and a lot of my family is vegetarian, and they like it with vegetarian dishes," Williams added.

Huntsman has also set his sights on South Carolina, but he has considerable ground to make up.

Also, check age and weight restrictions before buying any play equipment that your kids might outgrow too quickly.

The conservative Protestants are equally likely to understand scientific methods, to know scientific facts and to claim knowledge of science. They are as likely as the nonreligious to have majored in science or to have a scientific occupation. While other studies have shown that the elite scientists who work at the 20 top research universities are less religious than the public, it appears that the vast majority of people with workaday scientific occupations are like their neighbors, religiously speaking

Their function was to be prepared to fight the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites. It is also often forgotten that our forces in Europe were equipped with U.S.-supplied nuclear weapons. The navy's main commitment was an antisubmarine NATO assignment in the North Atlantic and it was equally prepared to fight.

"I don't know that there are too many arteries in this country with this much development," said Ari Maron, whose family redeveloped East Fourth Street downtown.

2009 Limerick Lane Block 1970 Russian River Valley Zinfandel ($36, 14.4%): This much-loved property is now controlled by Marietta Cellars' Bilbro family, and they have applied their blending talents to its bottlings, the youngest of which is from 42-year-old vines. Dusky, tangy and a touch sweet, with plum and candied violet, it shows great bones: a dusty minerality and big tannic backbone. For truly old vines, there's the cardamom-edged 2009 Limerick Lane Block 1910 ($48, 14.8%), which shows the subtlety that old Zin vines can offer.
And for you maple fans? An article in the Atlantic magazine opines that the entire U.S. maple syrup industry could be gone by 2100. Maybe it’ll shift to the Yukon or Tierra del Fuego or something, but it probably won’t be coming from New England anymore.
Steve Dever, the task force's executive director, and Richard Stuebi, the energy expert at NorTech and the Cleveland Foundation, opened the session, saying that even with the expansion of support, the task force at this point is sticking with its earlier plan of building up to eight 2.5 megawatt turbines about four or five miles out in the lake, to demonstrate that it can be done.

If you know much about the state of contemporary journalism, this will sound like pure folly. It's not meant to be; the book, written in 1998, is set at the turn of the millennium, before Sept. 11, before the 2008 economic crisis. Originally, publishers weren't interested in an amusing book about journalists and terrorism; after 9/11, they didn't want to touch it. But it wasn't the Taliban that informed Shriver's fiction; it was the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which she covered as an American journalist in Belfast.

Recall that only two years ago, Republicans nominated for governor a candidate known, like Santorum, for his deeply held socially conservative values. Recall, again, the political situation then.

What's more, he wanted to raise taxes. Sound familiar?

We know, from the casualty figures on TV, how dangerous this duty is. The film shows how confoundingly hard it is. Soldiers trained, in the narrator's words, to stop a Russian advance must now contend with a crazy-making range of circumstances. They stop traffic for 15 minutes until a suspicious-looking plastic bag can be examined. (The bag turns out to be empty). They function as truant officers, taking a glue-sniffing Iraqi kid off the street. They guide a rambling debate in an Iraqi district town meeting with unflagging patience. They burst into the house of suspected bomb-builders. (No bombs are found, but several residents are detained, then transferred to Abu Ghraib prison.) And, night after night, they go out on patrol in neighborhoods where, at any moment, they can be pinned down by sniper fire, or blown apart by improvised explosive devices.

Todd Pletcher’s best prospects may be Uncle Mo and Stay Thirsty in the Classic. Around Churchill, a strong sentiment is running against Uncle Mo. They don’t like him. Chief among them is retired top jockey Jerry Bailey, who said, “Uncle Mo is by Indian Charlie, he doesn’t want to go a mile and a quarter.

A navigation system is standard on the SL; it's an affordable $800 on automatic SV models. It's based on an SD card, though, not a full-fledged hard drive. Experience shows that SD-card-based navigation systems can run a bit slower, and the Juke's 5-inch screen is a bit small. On the plus side, Nissan's system is among the first I've tested with intuitive map scrolling. You swipe the map left or right, much like on a touch-screen smartphone, rather than holding your finger in one corner and waiting for the cursor to move there. Alas, the map has far too few street labels.
