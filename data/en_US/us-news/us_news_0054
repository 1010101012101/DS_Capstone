While the narrative is never less than entertaining and the perspective always acute, the book does not quite live up to its title. Fuller never makes a convincing case that contemporary conflicts could have been just as acute had Islam never existed, and at times the precise point of his digressions is lost. The analysis of Islam in India and tensions between Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs is informative about the degree to which culture and context shaped conflict, but it isn't clear how that adds to his overall argument that Islam is incidental.

In commenting on his appointment that day, Portman issued a statement with a budget fact that struck us as curious. He said, "I am honored to answer the call to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and will work hard to ensure that meaningful spending cuts are made to reduce our deficits, change the trajectory of Washington's record high debt, and to encourage economic growth and job creation. With the U.S. debt now equal to 100 percent of the GDP, Washington cannot continue to kick the can down the road again."
"It was better to come back home because I was able to focus a lot on my weight and my strength and conditioning. Also I want to be around my friends and family.

That's why I decided to come home and be with my people."
UO defense vs. Nevada offense: Here is where Nevada could fall off dramatically from last season. The Wolf Pack, operating the Pistol Offense invented by coach Chris Ault, averaged 41 points per game while going 13-1 in 2010. That came after leading the nation in rushing with 345 yards per game in 2009. The offense befuddled California last season when the Wolf Pack defeated the Pac-12 team, 52-31 at home. The problem for Nevada is that those numbers were put up with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running back Vai Taua in the backfield. Both are now in the NFL. They accounted for 2,836 yards rushing and 39 touchdowns last season. Kaepernick also passed for 3,022 yards and 22 touchdowns. Stepping in at quarterback is fifth-year senior Tyler Lantrip, who has thrown 23 passes in his career. Oregon's defense stood strong against LSU despite being placed in unenviable situations. That shouldn't be the case this week and UO's depth and athleticism could pose problems for an inexperienced quarterback who will be making his first start at Autzen Stadium.

He's stunningly optimistic, barely flinching at limits, shown by his reapproach to dunking, which he says is coming soon, and his passion for the game, which his teammates felt as he sat nicely dressed on the bench, burning inside when they struggled, thinking, "I just want to go out there and shoot and everything and do it for them."
A July 2011 article in The Economist observed this sad reality of human nature: "Both (the USDA and IOM) agree that merely improving access to healthy food does not change consumer behavior. Open a full-service supermarket in a food desert and shoppers tend to buy the same artery-clogging junk food as before — they just pay less for it. The unpalatable truth seems to be that some Americans simply do not care to eat a balanced diet, while others, increasingly, cannot afford to."

Although the Golden Gate Bridge is one of the city's leading tourist attractions, bringing in 10 million visitors a year, it offers remarkably few facilities for visitors. At the San Francisco end of the span, there's a small plaza off the metered parking lot that features a statue of Joseph Strauss, the designer and chief engineer of the world-famous span, a chunk of cable from the bridge, and a small weather-battered interpretive sign. Nearby are a snack bar and the roundhouse gift shop.

WELFARE CHECK, PEARL ROAD: At 11:55 a.m. June 5, police received a call regarding a possibly disoriented woman in a church parking lot. According to complainants, the woman took 25 minutes to park her vehicle and appeared to be wearing a nightgown as she wandered around the parking lot during a Mass. Police spoke with a friend of the woman’s, who stated that is simply how she dresses. She reported she was wandering around the parking lot because she hadn’t been to the church for a few years, and didn’t know where the entrance was. Police noted, “Other than appearing ornery, she appears to be OK.”

But true to his namesake — the legendary New York City rapper Rakim — Rocky is clear in his goals to define a generation of that city's rap. And part of that is to leave much of the genre's cultural baggage behind.

The $2 trillion hedge-fund industry still will face restrictions. To qualify, for example, investors still will need to prove they have at least $1 million in investible assets or make more than $200,000 a year. And even some consumer advocates contend the current rules are draconian, preventing fund managers from putting basic information on their websites and even chatting with reporters about strategies or performance for fear the comments get interpreted as solicitation.
Morton Street, near Union Square, was another street of open prostitution where ladies of the evening, with names like "Idoform Kate" and "Rotary Rosie," held forth. The top performers charged $1, but sex was on sale for as little as 25 cents. Morton Street is now called Maiden Lane.

The tea party's role in the GOP's 2010 takeover of the House has given some anti-deficit activists hope that the White House and congressional leaders will finally swallow major spending cuts.

This idea of touchstones is essential to "Otherwise Known as the Human Condition" — throughout the book, certain names pop up again and again. There is Berger, whom Dyer calls a mentor, and whose "ability to write on so many different subjects in so many different ways was an indication not only of his ability but also of his success as a writer"; there is Don DeLillo, Rebecca West, Garry Winogrand, Richard Misrach, William Gedney. The last three are photographers, and their presence highlights both Dyer's range and the coherence of his point of view. Like Berger, he is willfully eclectic, opening the book with 19 essays on photography, moving to literature and music, and then less classifiable pieces: journalism and "Personals." Yet like Berger also, this heterogeneity adds up to a wider outlook on the world.

Bloodthirsty bunnies dwell along a hill in Harmony Township, attacking hunting dogs to avenge the deaths of fellow cottontails. Even the most sharp-eyed sportsman cannot kill these hopping predators, locals say. A New York hunting columnist first reported the "spook rabbit" phenomenon in 1891. He ventured out to Harmony and fired at the elusive critters for more than an hour, failing to hit a single target. He remained skeptical, however, explaining that rabbits were protected by dense undergrowth. The wounded dogs, he added, were not the victims of fluffy fiends. Thorn-laced shrubbery along the trail was the likelier culprit, the writer surmised.

Some factors might have worked against him. The 1969 Cubs, an enduring symbol of failure, already had three players in the Hall: Ernie Banks, Billy Williams and Fergie Jenkins. Why should that ill-fated team be rewarded so lavishly? Some opponents did not like the way Santo ran and clicked his heels after each Cubs victory. Perhaps that played a role with previous Veterans Committee votes. But in light of some of the touchdown celebrations we see weekly, Santo's mode of celebration seems charming now.

We should hear from Mr. Romney on a matter of this kind. And in full and bold detail, what the voice of America will be in a Romney presidency—what it will stand for in regard to Syria, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan.

From my visit 15 years earlier, I remembered that Delicate Arch wasn't easy to get to. I was surprised when my wife, Ashley, read from our guidebook that the hike would take only 15 minutes. Ten minutes into it, we were at the bottom of a steep sandstone hill. Twenty minutes later and only halfway up, our breathing was labored, and we were burning up. Looking ahead at the rest of the hill and the one beyond, we knew this couldn't be the hike Ashley had read about.

Airlines all too often fail to provide the service you expect, and when you complain, they all too often fail to provide a satisfactory response. If an airline doesn't fulfill its contract or causes you actual financial loss, and still stonewalls your complaint, you have some remedies -- including asking for a credit card chargeback, notifying the Department of Transportation, and even hauling the offending line into small claims court.
These are positive steps, but they don't go far enough. For one thing, the deals and the trade association rules are not binding. The companies can back out of them.

For example, last night's show started at 8:30 p.m. — only so that the network could get in its own half-hour of red-carpet interviews.

Or does it? After the first episode of “Luck” aired last week, message boards were full of complaints about the sound quality. It was hard to hear what the actors were saying, particularly Nolte and John Ortiz, who played Peruvian trainer Turo Escalante. Kevin Dunn, whose character is in a wheelchair and uses an oxygen tank, spoke into the mask at one point. When the dialogue was audible, it was hard to decipher. Many of the characters spoke cryptically and used a racetrack/gambler patois unfamiliar to the uninitiated. HBO anticipated that problem and put a glossary on its website, defining “pick six” and “bug boy” for those who’ve never been to Santa Anita, much less Portland Meadows.

Political consultant Julius Henson, facing charges stemming from the infamous 2010 "relax" robocall that has already resulted in one criminal conviction, wants to put the entire state Democratic Party on trial. It's an odd defense strategy — he seems not to be focused on either the question of whether he actually did what he is accused of doing or whether the robocall was protected free speech. But it's not altogether surprising, either. Mr. Henson has long cultivated a bad-boy reputation, and he has never been one to pass up a chance for the spotlight. His political career looks to be ruined anyway — though in Maryland, one can never be sure — so why not go out in a blaze of glory?

I guess we will have to wait for the state to impose a stringent tax cap levy of 2.5 or 2.9 % next year and take this out of the hands of the local elected officials. Don’t bet on it though because there is bound to be a loophole and the local council majority (if they have a mayor on their side) will drive through loopholes on the way to your bank account.

I just started to spend always four or five hours on the classic training of the violin and then just sing even more hours. It was very hard, but it was very beautiful somehow.

At the western edge of town on San Pablo Avenue, Nordin stops at the newly constructed Vista Point.

The park and all its glory will live on in photos. As a student of this magnificent park, I feel as though I have a lifetime to perfect my craft and to master my visions. I am proud to be able to share some of my pictures and to pursue a lifelong dream that started in a hot car nearly 50 years ago with my family.

The outdoor bar and patio is a great way to enjoy the breeze and the laid-back atmosphere of the surrounding neighborhood. Check the cocktail list for a variety of ouzo and Metaxa-based beverages. I liked the Mama's Greek Lemonade, a mix of ouzo and sour with a Metaxa 7 float. You can also order a shot of Plomari ouzo and keep the neat cordial glass that it's served in.

Pinfield left “120 Minutes” in 1999; in 2003, it was canceled. The show’s amalgam of offbeat videos, choice classic cuts, clockwork imagery and interview segments was occasionally imitated by other video programs. But no successor to “120 Minutes” ever emerged. It is arguable that YouTube and other free video-sharing sites on the internet are that successor, and that “120 Minutes” is no longer necessary.

But Erwin Chemerinsky, University of California, Irvine's law school dean, argued that the Arizona law is a far more brazen attempt to regulate immigration than either the Texas or Proposition 187 cases.

The chorus of Southeastern Conference fans after Oregon's 22-19 loss to Auburn in the title game was annoying.

There is no more celebrated hot-dog roadhouse in New Jersey, maybe the country, than the venerable Rutt’s Hut, opened in 1928 by Royal “Abe’’ Rutt. It’s a brick-walled haunt with beer on tap and its world-famous Rippers — hot dogs that split apart when deep-fried. There’s a side dining room, but the routine at Rutt’s is to eat your dog standing up at one of the tables in the ordering area. A healthy dose of Jersey attitude comes with your hot dog. “This is the best hot dog you will have all day,” co-owner John Karagiorgis says. “Savor the moment.” There were rumors in hot-dog cyberspace several years ago that Rutt’s was about to close, but Karagiorgis quickly shot them down. “Rutt’s Hut,’’ he says, “will never close.” Thank goodness. The state’s pre-eminent shrine to grease shoulders on, diets be damned.

But that's not enough. Cuyahoga County also needs a council that's prepared both to advise FitzGerald and to provide his new administration with smart oversight when the new government takes power on Jan. 1.

Despite my vocation as a nonjudgmental sex educator, witness and unbiased documentarian of all sorts of sexual scenarios, I've never been the type to make public displays of affection. The only time I ever attended the Exotic Erotic Ball, I watched newbies drop trou and nonconsensually assault onlookers with drunken oral sex in public, and I simply thought, "They must be having fun," "I hope it's not a long drive back to Walnut Creek" and "Once is enough for this event for the rest of my life."

I’m not bringing this up to drive a dagger into the hearts of Terps fans -- trust me, I was groaning, too, when he ran hard against my alma mater, Penn State, a week earlier.

Roughly nine in 10 black-owned firms fit this description, both in New Jersey and the rest of the nation. This trend is not new among African-Americans, but such firms multiplied at a much faster pace in the Garden State, which saw a 72 percent jump during the five-year window, compared to 13 percent for the nation, the data shows.
