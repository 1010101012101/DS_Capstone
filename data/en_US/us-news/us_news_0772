Among the area's four other casinos, the only location to post a July gain was the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, where revenue rose just more than 1 percent compared with the previous July. Revenue declines at Harrah's in Maryland Heights, Ameristar in St. Charles and Argosy Alton ranged from about 3 to 7 percent.

Dustin Horning (@Dustbuster420) has a life that would make a pretty good driving game. Before going back to school to study engineering and mathematics, Horning worked as an auto mechanic and manager in the field. But with the addition of his new son last month, the high-octane aspect of his life reached a new level.
The path to nirvana starts with appetizers at Himalayan Cafe in Old Pasadena. Those hot, steamy curry-stuffed dumplings called momo look exactly like twisty-top Chinese xiao long bao, but their fillings taste vaguely Indian. Every spectacular bite, accented with bright pungent "pickle" dipping sauce, shows off the Indo-Chinese personality of a cuisine that makes its home in the valleys and hills in the shadow of Mt. Everest.
"I'm worried first about people not getting a meal," said Deborah Flateman, CEO of the Maryland Food Bank. "I don't want to hear that somebody is hungry. But ideally, they could be eating the highest-quality food on the planet, and our business model is changing to do that."

With no bombshell revelations Tuesday, neither the Murdochs nor the lawmakers were able to gain an upper hand, said Tony Travers, a political analyst at the London School of Economics.
At a time when so many people are trying to clean out their systems with detoxifying pads, pills and gadgets, let's take a moment to honor the liver, the best detox device a body can have. Without prompting, the liver breaks down and dispenses with all sorts of toxic compounds, including alcohol and acetaminophen. Anyone who is truly interested in removing poisons from the body should probably spend less time applying detoxifying pads and potions and more time protecting their liver.
Along with some of his neighbors, the chairman of the Baltimore City Council's taxation committee is getting a remarkable tax break on his home: He pays just 16 percent of the bill. The Homestead Property Tax Credit picks up the rest.
The introduction of quarterly payouts is not only a turning point for the company. It also vividly illustrates the importance that investors place on dividends in today’s uncertain stock market.

With just three weeks to go before Election Day, Corbett has been leading in the polls against Democrat Dan Otorano. But Christie was the main attraction at this event, where locals familiar with the tough-talking, Jersey guy governor from cable news shows and viral internet videos rushed to shake his hand. Many thought should run for president in 2012, no matter how many times he says he’s not interested.

Corporate sponsors want to see Ingenuity draw an increasing number of people from outside the area, Levin said. The festival is accomplishing that, he said. Marketing studies show about 12 percent of 2008 attendees came from outside this region, resulting in $2.3 million influx into Cleveland's economy.
In their day jobs (where they make a living) council and the law director may have occasion to go before the judge on other matters. The judge also knows who his friends and supporters are. This reeks of a back room deal that ignores the rights of the citizens in favor of an outside developer seeking special treatment.
"Her fittings are really like little character explorations. I'd act out scenes of what I knew was coming up in her fittings and we'd talk about who this character was, and what felt right and what didn't feel right. Amy was my collaborator. Amy is about so much more than just clothes. She's incredible."
HSBC, which launched the biggest cash call in British history with a 12.5 billion pound rights issue in March, was hit particularly hard by its exposure to the U.S. retail market. It reported a pretax loss of $2.9 billion pretax loss in its U.S. Personal Financial Services unit, where it has shut down its Household International Inc. consumer lending operation.

Kevin is a poster boy for cause-and-effect criminality. He is neglected by his mother and abused by her boyfriends, plays violent video games and listens to gangsta rap. But Troutmann fearlessly embraces the character, while mixed-race Ross (son of singer Diana) embodies the moral and class conflicts of a good kid in a bad situation. Snow, shaking off her teen-comedy background, shows similar promise, as does director Lagos.
"They are fun to be part of," said Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur, who has played in two Game 7s to decide Stanley Cup titles, not just series. "When you're a kid you always go out and say `this is Game 7 for all the marbles.' It brings back good memories because of that. You don't need to be nervous. You need to embrace the situation and make the best out of it."
Rep. Mark Waller, R-Colorado Springs, offered an amendment, which passed with bipartisan support, that takes $4.2 million from the Department of Corrections to increase funding for full-day kindergarten. Waller argued that inmate populations had been falling and that the money could be spared to help more kids get into full-day kindergarten.
They're a lot less vulnerable than children who have to walk through a bad neighborhood after their shift at McDonald's, but those kids are off the clock, so they're not Labor's problem.
"I can't really say that," he continued. "I have to say that to a reporter, but she really isn't. She yells at me about it. She's a fiercely independent woman. She runs the house. If you ask me how much is in our bank account, I couldn't even tell you. She's far and away tougher, stronger and more outgoing than I am."
But it wasn't about her life. "War Inside Me" is a teenage romance novel.

In Monday's arguments, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, articulated a complicated position. He contended that the mandate's penalty wasn't a tax as far as the Anti-Injunction Act was concerned. But anticipating Tuesday's arguments over the penalty's validity, he also said the health law could be upheld under the government's constitutional power to levy taxes.

Gingrich and Paul also campaigned here. Santorum, from neighboring Pennsylvania, never came.
The main, scripted mode of "Kinect Star Wars" is called "Jedi Destiny: Dark Side Rising." You play a padawan, a Jedi-in-training. The mode starts with some basic lightsaber and Force training, then quickly sends you into the first of a series of battles against the evil Trade Federation's droid and alien armies.
One result of metric's failure to catch on here is reflected in the results of a survey released this past week by Consumer World, a consumer-information site. Edgar Dworsky, the site's founder and a former consumer-affairs official in Massachusetts, tested 721 readers of his site and electronic newsletter about their knowledge of grams. The survey showed them two nutritional labels for yogurt, identical except that one listed 25 grams of sugar, and the other six teaspoons. Fewer than half of those polled realized those were equivalent quantities, and most erred on the side of finding the 25 grams healthier.
Two years before the next national elections, it is clear that independent campaign money -- unleashed by the Supreme Court -- will wield even more influence in 2012.
"I don't come from a business background," said Tischler, who has been focusing more on making delicious dosas than cooking up complicated profit and loss statements. "So I feel that I'm really in the dark. I've been stumbling around asking all kinds of questions. I want to know how to make a business plan, how to get licenses, how to budget. The class has been incredibly informative."
Seau died Wednesday of an apparent gunshot wound to the chest. San Diego police are investigating the death as a suicide. Seau, a veteran of 20 NFL seasons and performer in 12 Pro Bowls, was 43 years old.
If you're a casual Oregon sports fan (or a casual fan of any other Pac-12 school), would you rather tune into a regular-season baseball or softball game featuring two teams at the top of the standings, or the Payton Jordan Cardinal Invitational, which includes a series of distance races, one after the other, each taking somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes to complete, only one or two of which might include a runner from your school?

Scientists have long believed that the ability of disease-causing bacteria to outwit antibiotic medicines was a man-made phenomenon, said Eileen Choffnes, director of the Institute of Medicine's forum on microbial threats. The growing use of antibiotics derived from plants and synthesized in laboratories was thought to have spurred adaptations that made many of these bacterial pathogens less vulnerable to drugs used to fight tuberculosis, malaria, gonorrhea, influenza, pneumonia and AIDS.

When asked if the text messages or photos described in the New Times article were authentic, Babeu said that was a private issue that he would not go into.

And 2012 is already looking like, as Entertainment Weekly suggested, the “Geekiest Year Ever.” There will be a return to Tolkien with “The Hobbit,” the all-superhero-star “The Avengers,” a rebooted “The Amazing Spider-Man” and a re-rebooted Superman,“Man of Steel.”
There's a reason why many St. Louisans may never have heard of Ron Jackson, despite his large and devoted following in his field. It's the same reason why his retirement went unremarked for weeks.
Two excellent, classic films are not on my list, "Bridge on the River Kwai" and "Cool Hand Luke." To be sure, they are about prison life, which always includes escape. But both films are more about the life inside the walls as opposed to the consuming desire to get out. For that reason, and that reason alone, these two gems are not included.
DOMESTIC ASSAULT/FIRST-DEGREE BURGLARY: A man broke into a residence and attacked a woman between 11:45 p.m. April 16 and 12:01 a.m. April 17 in the 2800 block of Texas Avenue.

Now, "the technology has advanced so much that it's just as good as having it in a glass, from flavor profile standpoint," Biles said.
A rights referendum would throw Maryland back to the dark ages. Quite simply, civil rights legislation is not put to the vote. If it were, the group in the numerical majority would always win. There would be no mixed-race marriages, hoteliers would be able to decide their customers by skin colors, and kids would play on segregated playgrounds and swim in segregated pools.
The houses in the neighborhood are well-kept, some with picket fences and expansive front lawns.
Speaking to business leaders at the Institute of Directors annual conference, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called the figures "disappointing."
"I didn’t think it was fair for guys with 10 or more years left before retirement to bear the brunt of the criticism for bringing a case like this," O’Neill said. "This argument about $45,000 is specious and disingenuous."
Located on the corner of Taylor and Washington streets, where the cable car careens down the hill, Venticello is still a lovely spot for romance, or just a weeknight outing. Faux Tuscan yellow walls, dim lighting and a glimpse of the tremendous view create a wonderful setting.

But hanging in there brings its own set of challenges.
Once upon a time, many university officials thought gambling ads were at odds with their mission of educating young people. As recently as 2004, a Pac-10 official said the conference discouraged schools from accepting sponsorships from gambling interests, and the NCAA's former gambling-issues officer said many schools turned down such offers.
“That’s two opposite ends of the spectrum,” said Steven Johnson, a former KU linebacker who played for Mangino and Gill. “You’ve got a really mean, strict coach who demands a lot out of you, and coaches a certain way. And then you’ve got a players’ coach.”
A Type 2 incident management team has set up camp at Odell. Firefighters, numbering more than 300, face a big challenge battling this fire because the area is inaccessible and has 60 degree slopes in areas.
Other successful productions — “Don’t Let It Break Your Heart,” “Hurts Like Heaven” — are so drenched in synthesizer that they often sound like Passion Pit covering Arcade Fire. Guitarist Jonny Buckland hasn’t gone missing, but he’s had to redefine his role as his six-string is pushed to the margins. He contributes his best riff to “Charlie Brown” (besides a reference to a “cartoon heart,” this, alas, has nothing to do with Charles Schulz), the album’s most propulsive cut even if it doesn’t exactly rock.
What to do? To ease the discomfort, immobilize your wrist with a splint when you can, including during sleep. Also, take anti-inflammatories, like aspirin, and ice it morning and night. If the problem persists, you can get noninvasive endoscopic surgery to open up the tunnel and relieve symptoms. Most people recover completely and never have the problem again.
Smart phone: When I first got the iPhone 3Gs (starting at $99 plus two-year contract), my wife thought it would be another toy. Since then, having access to the Internet, maps, plane and train schedules and language translation - all without Wi-Fi - has rescued us in a dozen destinations on three continents. (When our driver in Berlin couldn't make his GPS work, we made the flight on time only after calling up the route on my phone and directing him to the airport.)
“I don’t know a single lazy judge in this office,” said Dan R. Hyatt, a former trial attorney who has spent 11 years as a Social Security judge.
The governor has said his plan won't be a budget-buster because he's cut spending aggressively. The proposed cut would be phased in over three years.
Kids congregate -- even where they can't actually enter -- if there's a crowd and some music to listen to. That suggests that at least some of the weekend underage crowd that now keeps company in the streets of the Warehouse District might be lured away to better alternatives aimed specifically at them.
Cisco Systems Inc. reported another drop in quarterly earnings and said it plans to cut more jobs as the big networking-equipment company continues to struggle with stiffer competition and management miscues.

Seattle began the season with two road losses: to the San Francisco 49ers, 33-17, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-0.
It's been widely speculated that Huff's pending divorce -- which became public Monday -- might be a contributing factor to his condition.
The good news is that we don't have to. At least not all at once.
The idea of state lawmakers not being paid unless the budget they pass is balanced is clearly a winner with the public - but beware. This voter-passed law will lead to serious and unexpected repercussions down the line.
Pound salt and garlic in a mortar with a pestle into a paste. Add galangal (or ginger) and pound into a paste. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add coriander and cumin seeds, cayenne and turmeric. Mix to combine. Add coconut cream mixture and mix well. Set aside. Alternatively, puree ingredients in a blender. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Stored in a glass jar with a tight- fitting lid, marinade will keep overnight in refrigerator.
It's delightful, the ways the borrowers make essential tools out of found objects we take for granted -- a leaf as an umbrella, nails to create stairs or staples to build ladders, strips of duct tape to help scale walls.
1. No. 2 Auburn at No. 11 Alabama, Friday, 2:30, CBS: Probably the best Iron Bowl since both were ranked in top six in 1994. If Alabama wins to knock Auburn out of the national title game, that could save the BCS a potential headache if the Cam Newton saga explodes.
It also underscored his flair for creative (and occasionally destructive) juxtapositions. Astute Southern rapper David Banner, A Tribe Called Quest founder Q-Tip and many superb lesser-known Golden State emcees (Turf Talk, the Federation) made guest appearances. DJ Shadow, a Bay Area native, was attracted to hyphy, the smooth, playful variant of hip-hop popular in Northern California.
1:45 p.m.: Burger King for lunch.
And finally, put as much on "automatic" as you can. That might mean setting up an appointment for walking or working out with someone, so you don't have to "decide" to do it or not. Or perhaps making the same nutritious breakfast every day.
Jones’ one-out homer in the second inning was his second in as many nights and sixth in a span of 47 at-bats. After hitting his 450th career homer Wednesday, he said he finally had strength back in his legs after July arthroscopic knee surgery and a quadriceps strain.
"But the thing is, with as much as David plays on the power play and penalty kill, sometimes five-on-five is a rest, and we want to get him past that, where he's really contributing more five-on-five. We just want him to trust his linemates and not have to be the safety net that he thinks he has to be all the time."
Tech continued its torrid hitting, strafing the Bulldogs with line drives and burrowing through seven Georgia pitchers. The Jackets, hitting .299 for the season, had hit .316 in their past five games. Eight of Tech’s nine starters reached base by a base hit. Daniel Palka, Zane Evans, Thomas Smith and Daniel Spingola each collected two hits. Smith and Kyle Wren both drove in two runs.
Kershaw posted a 2.45 earned-run average in 22 innings this spring.
By late last week, hope for a deal had all but faded, leaving panel members to spend a disconnected weekend talking with their aides and trekking to TV studios for recrimination-filled appearances on Sunday talk shows. On Monday, several members took one last stab.
Moreover, although Mr. Biden made an eloquent explanation of his thinking on the matter, the context in which he placed his recent evolution on the issue was not the kind of story the White House would make up. Certainly, the anecdote about seeing the heart-melting "look of love" two young children of a gay couple had for their parents could have come from a focus group, but the fact that this meeting took place at a fund-raiser in a private home in Los Angeles — rather than, say, at a PTA meeting in Ohio — gives it a less-than-ideal authenticity.
Denver fell one degree short of a heat record today when the mercury peaked at 82 degrees just before 1:30 p.m. The record high for the date was set in 1938 and tied in 1987, according to the National Weather Service.

Shortly after 6 p.m. Sunday, the 20-year-old victim and his girlfriend were waiting for a MAX train when two women approached the couple, according to Sheffer. The women had a disagreement with the victim's girlfriend, who later told police the women spit on her.
That method has evolved into a scheme whereby those in power redraw the lines of any issue to suit them and then declare what is best for the public. Never mind that their stories are half made up and will benefit only them and their campaign contributors.

Our trek was led by 15-year veteran guide Jesus Cardenas. With a smile that made even the most grueling of climbs seem effortless, Jesus provided sound advice ("Drink water. Drink water") coupled with ample encouragement ("Don't give up…only five minutes more!"). His easy-going style contrasted with that of his more serious assistant, Helen Reinoso, whom we dubbed "Hell-on-wheels" for the torrid pace she set.
The Biltmore, whose signature summer event is the "Hollywood & Wine" program, is kicking off its holiday concert series on Memorial Day weekend with "A Night Under the Stars," featuring performers from popular TV shows "Dancing With the Stars," "American Idol" and "So You Think You Can Dance."

The holidays should be spent with friends and family, not in the emergency room. By taking a few, easy safety precautions, we can keep the festivities happy and healthy.
This straightforward, familiar plot leads to predictable results. After a vivid struggle with homesickness, a time when "nothing here was part of her," when everything seemed "false, empty," Eilis gradually begins to shed old country ways, even under the scrutiny of her Brooklyn landlord and Father Flood. As Eilis' work and studies progress, she discovers joy in "the mere sensation of savoring the prospect of something." This is not a familiar feeling for her -- and neither are the stirrings of love she soon feels for an Italian plumber named Tony. He is "not like anyone else she had ever met," being open and tender with her. Moreover, "he was delighted by things." This, perhaps more than any other quality, astounds Eilis. Delight is a feasible human response!

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on a 30-year loan dropped to 3.88 percent this week, down from 3.9 percent. In February, the rate hit 3.87 percent, the lowest since long-term mortgages began in the 1950s.

The biographer divides the book into five parts that correspond to the roles Jane played in her own outsized life -- "Daughter," "Actress," "Movie Star/Sex Symbol," "Political Activist" and "Workout Guru/Tycoon Wife." The absence of "Mother" is hardly an oversight. Fonda has described herself as a lousy mom. Her own mother, Frances, slit her throat from ear to ear when Jane was 12. Told Frances had died of a heart attack by her icy papa, Jane learned about the suicide from a classmate's movie magazine.

The real risk is that once again the Republicans will lose an entitlement fight, and if that happens this time, then the chances will be much higher that the nation's financial future will be blighted by higher taxes or skyrocketing interest rates triggered by a bond market revolt.
"Oh god, I want you," Don tells Megan in the cab afterward. Here, it's, as always, hard to tell what Don really, deep down, likes: Megan's beauty and youngness or her budding copywriter talents. The lines are blurred in true "Mad Men" fashion. You want to think he's attracted to both qualities, and the writers here do a good job at making you really think hard about it and still not being quite sure.

It was not without its fault. Some of the organization of the truck placement and dining areas could have been better, but that’s not the point right now. The focus should be on the fact that people are enthusiastic and wiling to support a local event based solely around food. An event that people can bring their children to (as many did), have a beer, good food and interact with other food minded people. It made me happy to see such a good turnout with the hopes that this could become a more permanent and weekly affair.
The 23-year-old reigning MVP apparently has a baby coming in the near future. The Bulls likely will enter the playoffs as the best team in the league. Or rather, the one with the best record in the league. Will Rose have even more distractions than those caused by his ailing body? Who can say.

At the March 28 Board of Education meeting, the oard unanimously agreed to test for radon April 11-13. According to Gamble, the EPA and DEP recommend that radon testing be done between October and March, when there is typically cooler weather and the windows are less likely to be open. However, the decision to test during spring break was based on the fact that there was unusually warm weather this winter along with after-school activities that could possibly affect testing. The Board of Education also was in agreement to be proactive and test now versus waiting until October, he said in his blog on the district’s website.
Petrino just completed his fourth season with the Razorbacks, who have developed into a national contender since he was hired away from the Atalanta Falcons during the 2007 season.

Once, again, the Ohio Department of Education has issued school district "report cards," and, once again, the public is being misled. Consider that the ODE assigns districts "grades" without even acknowledging one of the most obvious factors that impact student learning: Students from economically disadvantaged families tend to perform poorly compared to their economically advantaged peers. Here is a brief look at that data in Northeast Ohio school districts:
As the voting got under way, regime forces stormed several poor farming villages in central Syria where residents were boycotting the elections, shooting randomly and torching homes, two witnesses said. One resident who asked to be identified only by his first name, Zakariya, for fear of retribution, said at least four people in his village of Qabr Fidda were killed—including a man and his two daughters, who were burned alive.
The "teenagers go to a remote location, awaken something terrible, and horrible things ensue" story is a familiar one, and there are loads of hat-tips to other greats in the genre (as well as to other types of horror movie, from Japanese horror to monster movies, and even "Back to the Future"), but "The Cabin in the Woods" is about something else altogether.
The elote in a cup is a velvety mixture of corn, butter, mayonnaise and lime juice, with a sprinkling of powdered chili on top. Mix it all up, or spoon your way through the different layers of tastes and textures. It’s also sometimes available on the cob, ready to eat like a big, messy, spicy lollipop.

While they're in session, they also should pass the bill that would bring control of the St. Louis Police Department back to the city. There is a deal there, too, and the only reason that bill isn't law is because it got caught in the economic development crossfire.
Planned Parenthood has released a statement denying any connection to the scouting group. In a statement of its own, the Girl Scouts of America did not address Morris' individual claims, but said:

One essay in particular stands out to me. David Gelernter, the renowned Yale computer-sciences professor who was injured in an attack by the Unabomber, talks about how he is bringing up his own sons against the culture. He writes that "a man's role in respect to women is to protect, to help, to support, to cherish as opposed to consume. We are a consumer society and the number one consumption is that of women."
Residents have also heard stop signs may be eliminated at Hemlock Point and Hemlock roads and a couple of curves in the road may be straightened out, moves that would give some drivers the feeling they could safely go much faster than the posted 35 mph speed limit. Phillips said there are no plans to straighten the road and no final decision has been made on removing the stop signs. Residents have also been told the road needs to be widened to meet federal standards, but Phillips insists the road widening is simply to shore up crumbling berms.

Had it not taken so long for Detroit to get with the program -- and to admit that it's broke -- things would not be this bad.
It was not particularly bold of Elway to covet Manning. It was not particularly bold to contact Manning. It was bold to chase Manning without any certainty he could catch him. This was exactly the kind of high-risk, high-reward stuff that made Elway into Elway and still apparently defines him.
The prosecutor's office has opposed both motions. In a formal legal response, the prosecutor's office said Baum's rights were "scrupulously honored" by police; his waiver of his Miranda right was voluntary and knowing; and he can intelligently participate in his defense even if he claims he cannot recall every detail of the incident, court documents state.

These sorts of arrangements aren’t exactly new. The pioneering Kronos Quartet’s recording of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze” on their self-titled 1986 album still stands as a model of genre-bending. The Turtle Island String Quartet also did well by Hendrix with “All Along the Watchtower” on last year’s “Have You Ever Been…?”

Using previously unavailable letters and diaries, BBC documentary producer Clay examines the events leading to World War I through the relationships among three cousins: George V of England, Wilhelm II of Germany and Nicholas II of Russia, who together ruled more than half the world. She argues -- critics said quite effectively -- that personal and familial dynamics were an important impetus toward the eventual outbreak of war.
Brown hasn't matched Jackson's approach of giving subtle digs to players, officials and reporters. But he has publicly questioned the NBA's failure this season to give Blake Griffin a flagrant foul for pushing rookie guard Darius Morris and shoving Lakers forward Pau Gasol in the back. The latter incident eventually prompted the NBA to give Griffin a flagrant foul. Brown has also earned two ejections this year for arguing calls.
BALLINASLOE, Ireland—Michael Brennan once earned as much as €1,000 ($1,300) a week as a carpenter installing roofs during Ireland's housing boom.

On the matter of which candidate could be trusted to roll back the excessive powers that Bush has aggregated, Obama is vague and McCain is exasperating. McCain has properly condemned the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and said he would close it, but when the court granted detainees there the rights of habeas corpus, McCain denounced the ruling as "one of the worst decisions in the history of this country." He condemned torture, but then, with the campaign underway, voted against legislation to limit the CIA's use of coercive interrogation. Those oscillations do not reassure.
"Marty was pushing the boundaries all the time, saying, 'Let's go further, let's go further,'" says Schoonmaker, who has edited most of Scorsese's films since "Raging Bull."

Johansson apparently relished taking part in the film's fight scenes. Her catsuit was reportedly in tatters after filming ended, because her male costars weren't afraid to get rough for the sake of art. They tried "to kill me for five or six months," the actress joked, according to LA Remix.
Day 11 was not so much a wall as the side of a mountain. I had nothing for it. My day's "work'' amounted to barely recording 1.1 miles in 20 minutes on the treadmill while watching "Legally Blonde.'' What does that tell you?
An only child, Nathan used to imitate bird chirps and animal growls, and give voice to his action figures. "He grew up and it kind of stuck," Arianne said.

But a case could be made that the school would function well as a magnet; it's accessible to students via MAX and near the center of the eastside campuses. Grant has the highest enrollment in the district, largely because it's a school that some students from just about every other high school want to get into. It doesn't have a marquee program, but has an overall abundance of electives, advanced coursework and a reputation for excellence.
Harvick's main issue with the new surfaces is that they don't wear out the tires.
Browne, 65, has long since traded his 1960s-era long locks and droopy mustache for expensive, lawyerly overcoats, a trademark white scarf flung over the shoulder and carefully trimmed hair.

A Your molded-fiber (papier-mache) decoy dates from the mid-1940s or early 1950s. One clue to its age is the postal zone, 2, in the address. Postal zones were first used in 1943. Another clue is the material your decoy is made of. Molded fiber was first used for factory-made decoys in 1939, but it really took off after World War II. Then, in the early 1950s, molded fiber was replaced by Styrofoam and plastics. The hole on the top of your decoy originally was covered with a thin layer of fiber. It was designed to be closed with a wooden plug after the decoy was filled with ballast. Ariduk duck decoys sell for $5 to more than $100, depending on condition, color and type of duck.

Regardless of motive, the potential for voter confusion is high, because lawmakers have been tinkering with election laws since the beginning of last year. If they pass new legislation before the fall election, voters will be casting ballots under different rules than the March 6 primary.
"Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour" (2011): Cirque's much-hyped arena-sized tribute to the late King of Pop turned out to be a garish mess. From a depressing opening sequence mourning Jackson's lost childhood to a soulless finale about the sorry state of global ecology, the show lacked focus and only occasionally touched his larger-than-life stage presence. The one bright spot: A large puppet of Jackson as a child, the creation of Oregon theatrical designer Michael Curry. Grade: D
The federal government projected that 19 of the nation's biggest banks could suffer losses of up to $599 billion through the end of next year if the economy performs worse than expected and ordered 10 of them to raise a combined $74.6 billion in capital to cushion themselves.

The weekend's turn of events  in a state neighboring one where Romney served as governor  would indicate the GOP has not yet united behind the presumptive nominee, and there are indications the infighting may last all the way to the national convention.
Still, the high-profile deal — which could herald a high-stakes, global e-reader battle pitting Microsoft and B&N against Amazon — may throw an uncomfortable light on the trades, says lawyer Bob Benowitz, a partner at Rick, Steiner, Fell & Benowitz.
How did you land in Portland? About four years ago, my family went on a cruise (ugh) to Alaska (ooh) where I felt a special connection to nature, something I hadn’t really felt in any of the nine cities I’ve lived in. A year later, around the same time I launched ecopop, I got a recruitment call from Wieden+Kennedy with an invitation to “just come up and see” if I wanted to move here. Two weeks later, my dog, Star, and I traded in our high-priced tans for two-for-one trees. The W+K gig was short-lived but it brought me to Ptown. I can’t really imagine ecopop, a company that merges ecology with pop culture, or myself for that matter, being anywhere else.
Kucinich also has a house on Cleveland's West side, which he bought for $24,800 in 1973. He said he has wanted to buy a property in Washington for some time because he considers renting to be "lost money." He said he and Elizabeth spent a long time looking for a house in pricey D.C. before they found something they could afford. The couple moved into the house about six months ago, he said.
Stegner was driven, in part, by a sense that literary capital was still tied up in New York and the East.
And way out of the ballpark.
With the director present only as a name in the credits, "A Fan's Hope" is as good as its word in introducing a collection of determined conventiongoers who have come to San Diego in 2010 to pursue their different but connected dreams. They come with the charming innocence of true believers, and this film respects that pureness of heart.
The new Explorer has been completely redesigned. The most obvious difference: It's built on a car platform, not a truck platform, so it sits lower to the ground and has a smoother, more fuel-efficient ride.

Like most politicians who talk a good capitalist game, Santorum is a free-trader in theory and a protectionist in practice. But, oddly, so is Romney. In fact, the need to rein in China — that is, to stop Americans from buying Chinese products they wish to buy at prices they wish to pay — is just about the only subject that seems to bring out real passion in Romney. So here too the candidates are not far apart.

Pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet was on hand to expend his extraordinary keyboard skills on Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 5, the last and perhaps most vacuous of the composer's vacuous piano concertos. The concerto bears the subtitle "Egyptian," either because a tune in the slow movement is drawn from Saint-Saëns' travels by the Nile or because the score's garish bad taste and cheesy effects prefigure those of Cecil B. DeMille's film epic, "The Ten Commandments."
Google managers told employees to go home, and they did not know whether to come back Thursday, said an employee who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to talk to reporters.

The no-nonsense nature of the Barkley — built as a ferry in 1958 in Stevanger, Norway — was, I thought, central to its charm, and my wife, Laurel, agreed. She'd skipped the locomotive ride the day before but was happily on board as we cast off just after 8 a.m.

Speed: Senior Jamia Reid, who is batting .383, leads the Pac-12 with 44 stolen bases -- twice as many as any other player in the conference. Her daring theft of home two weeks ago against UCLA helped jump-start a victory after the Bruins took an early 2-0 lead.

Crows may be having an impact on birds of prey. "They harass the heck out of ravens and raptors," said Murphy. He describes an apparently fatal crow-fu attack on a Cooper's or sharp-shinned hawk: "My wife and I were watching a hawk fly down the hill toward Pine Lake Park when a flock of crows came after it. They swooped on it in dives like you'd see in a World War I movie. Eventually one crow got up behind it and dived down. It passed just behind the hawk and slapped it at the base of the skull. The hawk turned once in the air and took a straight dive into the trees down by the park. No way it pulled up. That bird was unconscious or dead in the air."
Meanwhile, they plan to spend the anniversary of Nancy's death in Oklahoma City, where she is buried.

The second, less interesting (and fictitious) story line depicts the romance between modern-day math lecturer Ruth (Reeves) and an Indian-American businessman (Firdous Bamjay).

The Maryland Department of the Environment has also attracted the ire of residents, who claim the agency has failed to properly vet the company's relationship with the former owner. Both MDE and the company deny the claims. MDE, which is nearing the end of its permit application process, has twice this fall delayed a deadline for public comment on the issue, now allowing citizens to weigh in on the permit application until November. If the permit is approved, the rubble landfill would serve as a dumping site for concrete, wood, drywall and other building materials.

For good measure, Pierce also led his team in rebounding with 14. Garnett had 15 points and 12 rebounds, while Bradley, who shifted over to take Rondo's spot at the point, chipped in with 14 points but only three assists—a far cry from what the Celtics usually get out of that position.

The prose purplishly peaks with "Lettuces Hand Picked by the Children of Gila River Crossing School: Locally Picked Tiny Greens, Artisan Date Cake, Timbale of Tomatoes & Sobrasada, Ash Goat Cheese & Blood Orange Vinaigrette." Disturbing questions raced through my mind. Why are the schoolkids out in the fields plucking microgreens instead of in the classroom? Is there an overseer? Do the students get paid or just get comp time off from English, science and history? Really, diners don't need all this menu detail.

I once saw John Daly card a 14 on a hole at Pebble, after which he lit a cigarette and walked off the course and out of the tournament. I've seen Tiger Woods hit a mile-high 9-iron to within inches of the hole while the crowd gasped in appreciation. And I walked behind Tom Watson as he finished his final round of U.S. Open play at the course he conquered in his historic 1982 victory. He had tears in his eyes, and so did I.

But while that added price transparency may tip the balance in favor of consumers, retailers also aim to exploit the new "bricks and mobile" landscape. Companies such as Starbucks and Macy's are using location-based marketing to notify loyal customers of sales and promotions, Girard said. Through various apps, retailers can tell when customers are near their stores and send them text messages about sales, which in some cases helps drive buying decisions, he said.
They might throw double blockers at him, which is fine with him. That's because if two blockers are going after him, somebody else on the SDSU defense will be left unblocked and free to stop plays. The beneficiary of that might be Logan Ketchum, SDSU's other senior outside linebacker.

Opponents of continuing the extension of unemployment insurance often make one of the following arguments: (1) the program is welfare for the undeserving; (2) it subsidizes leisure and is a major contributor to the high unemployment rate; or (3) the extension does little to create jobs.

Murray who, you ask? All the Racers did was come thisclose to being the first undefeated team since Indiana in 1975-76.

Tabor's dupes may have had the last laugh, because the silver king went broke not just because of the drop in the price of silver closed most of the mines, but because Tabor himself was a plunger, a sucker who couldn't resist a scam to strike it rich again. Lingenfelter says Tabor died believing the famed Matchless Mine could be worked for one last deal. And so did Baby Doe, who froze to death there years later.

• Oklahoma City Thunder 111, Portland Trail Blazers 107: 2011-2012 Game 24 Recap -- Welcome to Loud City: Tonight was a huge gut-check game for the Thunder after playing poorly last week. While there was certainly still a fair amount of less-than-precise play (19 turnovers, way too many jump shots), OKC committed soundly to playing more attentive defense and rebounding the ball. Unlike against the Clippers or Spurs, the Thunder did a much better job tonight in finding the outside shooters. As a result, the Blazers were held to 42.3% shooting and only 5-20 from the 3-point line. The Thunder got a gift, but they did not waste that gift in OT. They continued to play strong defense, denied the shooters, protected the rim, and left Portland with a very satisfying performance that came coupled with a win.

The Vikings finished the season strong and even upended Fort Zumwalt West, the top-seeded team in the Vikings' district, 2-0 on Monday.

This season, Strop’s ability to establish his mid- to high-90s fastball for a strike early in the count – and specifically leaning on his two-seam sinking fastball to compliment his mid-80s slider in order to keep hitters off balance – has helped the 26-year-old become a late-inning factor.

And Rubio might not even help Romney carry his home state. In Florida, the tea party senator is something of a polarizing figure. A Rasmussen Poll last month found that 48% of Floridians have a favorable view of Rubio, not an overwhelming number for a well-known senator.

We can discuss the free-throw margin, and question why the Blazers haven't looked comfortable in this playoff series for more than a quarter here or there. We can ask coach Nate McMillan about tempo, and wonder what the home court will be worth in Game 6.

Ducks after Cal and heading for the BCS title... I'm a concerned at the sight of LaMichael James, hobbling off the field, ending up on crutches and in a protective boot after the win over Cal. He's not just an important piece of this team --- he's THE most important. Winning the final two games of the season is a primary goal, but right after that comes limiting the punishment that James takes down the stretch. They'll need him healthy and in the lineup to win the whole thing. Without him, the Ducks can't beat Auburn, TCU or Boise State.

The sun was bright and warm at San Francisco International Airport when I met Susan, but I knew the weather gods had something less summery in store a few miles north in the city: a blanket of cool, moist fog.

"It's been a godsend for us," said Weigel.
Mr. Davitt's case might have been more difficult for Mr. Leopold and his attorney to dismiss if he had stopped there. But the indictment goes on to describe Mr. Leopold's supposed use of his executive protection officers and other county workers to arrange liaisons with a county employee and to prevent his live-in girlfriend from finding out about the second woman. Mr. Davitt claims those efforts cost the county thousands of dollars in police overtime. But perhaps the most personally damaging detail in Mr. Davitt's indictment is the charge that Mr. Leopold ordered county officers and an aide in his office to change his urinary catheter bag after two back surgeries.

With so many integral waterways— the Bosporus Strait dividing the city's European and Asian sides, the Sea of Marmara and the Golden Horn—ferries are a cheap and easy way to get around. We took a six-hour excursion one day along the Bosporus Strait ($14 round-trip) and spent another on an hour-long ride to Buyukada, the largest of a handful of islands in the Sea of Marmara called the Princes Islands.

Children and teens are consuming too much added sugar in their diets, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly one in every six calories they eat and drink comes from some type of added sugar.
The department argues that it must withhold some information out of concern for the safety of deputies, presumably because detainees might be able to game the system if they knew the rules in all their detail. Although we appreciate that safety is paramount, surely any inmate who is intent on harming a deputy or other inmates need not consult a manual to do so. And those with ties to violent gangs or other groups need only ask those already inside the lockups to gain a firm understanding of how deputies work.

On Feb. 29, Rush Limbaugh repeatedly insulted a woman over the radio air waves by calling her a "slut" and a "prostitute." He used those terms to label one innocent and responsible woman. The majority of women in America are using or have used contraception at some time during their lives. So, according to Mr. Limbaugh, millions of us could be identified as sluts or prostitutes. What he failed to make clear during his fateful show is that not all health insurance is government-funded. In fact, the majority of Americans who have health insurance have private health insurance.

"You don't want your son to go to a place where there's a potential issue," Sal Anzalone told the Eagle. "You expect the staff to have some sort of control on how things are handled with recruits when they visit. This is ridiculous."

Sanchez, a member of the world-champion Giants' rotation in 2010, got knocked out after 75 pitches in his last start, on Saturday.

It was 56 years later, 2008, when we came to Chicago to attend a ship reunion for the USS Conyngham (DDG-17), the ship he had commanded in 1968-70. We took a bus tour of the city and were pleased when our tour guide, Linda Fox, pointed out the Palmer House hotel, stating that it was one of Chicago's finest. My husband remarked that we had spent our honeymoon there, and she asked if we still had our receipt. We were delighted to tell her we did (we had put it in our wedding picture album). She told us the Palmer House had a policy that a couple who had honeymooned there, been married at least 50 years, and had the receipt for their hotel bill could stay for the same room rate they had paid on their honeymoon. She gave us the name and phone number of the man at the hotel who could make arrangements for us.

No. 4 Louisville (27-9) vs. No. 5 New Mexico (28-6), 6:30 p.m., TBS: There should be an entertaining point guard matchup between Louisville's Peyton Siva and New Mexico's Kendall Williams. Ultimately, though, the Lobos' chances depend on forward Drew Gordon, who averages a double-double and has to produce against a physical Cardinals frontcourt. Gordon is the Lobos' only frontcourt player of note. Louisville is spotty from three-point range (31.8%), but the Lobos need to keep an eye on Cardinals G Chris Smith, who can get hot in a hurry.
