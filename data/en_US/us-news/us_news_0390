However, Parker is an upgrade defensively from Sasha Pavlovic, Wally Szczerbiak and Tarence Kinsey, the players who were there last season. Also, he's been excellent as a spot-up 3-point shooter, and that is exactly what the Cavs need from that spot. He's a reason why LeBron James is averaging a career high in assists. Not to mention he is making half of what West is making and just 10 percent of what Shaquille O'Neal is making, and he's played in every game.

But the investigation pointed out that other indicators rated WindNuts anywhere from 74 degrees to 100.7. (Most modern, similarly size boats rate between 110 and 120 degrees.)

"Beat Down" has its flaws and lacks polish, but it has a huge heart. It's easy to root for Fran as she learns to navigate the world of adults and refuses to stay down for the count. The actors all give their best, and the matches are a blast. It's also fun to see what goes into the "fake" wrestling matches of the pro circuit. It may be decided in advance who wins, but the strength, skill, and guts of the wrestlers are as real as it gets.

-- La Russa on keeping Lohse in the sixth: "Well, I watched the inning. First of all, he pitched very effectively. The ball that Rollins hit to start it was off the end bat. That's what you get, well-placed. I keep watching, he strikes out Utley, which is a tough out. Then he gets a hopper from Pence. I haven't seen him do anything wrong, both up the middle, found a hole. Pretty tough to take him out there. I know Howard is a real tough match-up, and he got a ball in the middle of the strike zone for his first home run, and then he made another mistake to Ibanez."

All the "body of work" items -- Tressel's personal kindness on many levels, the inspirational messages to students and players, the patriotic gestures to troops in the Middle East -- will never be known.

On many personal "scoreboards," Tressel, despite the scandal, is still ahead.

øChanging identities: Since Dale Hunter took over as coach, the Capitals' defensive game has become more focused and defined. They aren't quite like the Jacques Lemaire Devils of the 1990s, but they are far more defensively savvy than Washington teams of recent vintage. Under Hunter's command, two-way player Brooks Laich is probably more of a coach's favorite than Ovechkin. Superstar or not, Ovechkin is being held accountable by Hunter. It's not like Ovi can't play a gritty style. He is tied for second among playoff hitters with 31. Based on how the Rangers and Capitals play and the quality of the goaltending that each team possesses, this could be a low-scoring series.

But Raymond D. Cotton, a Washington lawyer who specializes in contracts for university presidents and once represented Bruininks, said there is nothing unusual about Bruininks' returning to the faculty and taking two staff members with him. New university President Eric Kaler and the Board of Regents should embrace Bruininks' continued employment and capitalize on his fundraising contacts, Cotton said.

In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add corn, onion, garlic and tomato and saute until soft.
The offerings have changed dramatically with the new look. Although two dabbas are still available, most of the food is plated and served in very attractive style. The papadum ($4), for instance, are rolled like cones so you can easily stuff them with chutney rather than dipping them, as we’ve done at most Indian restaurants.
There's a hint of sadness in every joke: What's funnier, Hannah's presumptuous claim of being an important writer, a voice of a generation? Or her parents' too-late attempt to withhold financial aid and instill a sense of responsibility? Together they form an endearing mess.

You're nearly over the flu, but still feel down in the dumps. It's not just because the laundry's two feet high and you're behind at work. Your immune system is still recovering from its no-holds-barred battle against the virus, which required unleashing chemicals called cytokines that have a good cop-bad cop effect: While fighting the flu, they also mopped up serotonin, the key "feel good" chemical in your brain. So there's less of that happy stuff bouncing between your brain cells like a cheerful game of beach volleyball, and it takes time to replenish your serotonin supply. You can help.

The moral of this story is that you can gain as much from victory as you can from defeat. Returning leaders who saw action that night include Jack Corcoran, Tim Brown, Kordell Young, George Johnson and Devin McCourty. If we get past Cincinnati in the opener, we could be in for a special season. Rest assured, if the Big East's BCS bid is up for grabs versus WVU in December, the aforementioned leaders make sure we take it this time. No doubt about it!
Thursday's GOP measure would combine a full-year Pentagon budget with a big slice of cuts from domestic programs as the price to keep the government running. Democrats and the White House oppose the idea, preferring to focus on the broader legislation and not forfeit leverage.

Florence and Lask had argued for years that the Burlington and Essex County jails had wrongfully strip-searched Florence because jail officials had no "reasonable suspicion" that Florence — hauled in on a noncriminal offense — might have been concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.
Mahlangu wasn't kidding on her sign. She has traveled to Japan, France and the U.S. to paint wall-size installations. She has created a custom-paint job for a BMW art car (joining the likes of David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein and Alexander Calder). And her work has been exhibited from Italy to Australia, in such prestigious venues as Paris' Pompidou Centre and Germany's documenta IX exhibit. But that afternoon in her home, Mahlangu was content to chat with us about her art and her travels as a living icon of South Africa's Ndebele (pronounced "N-day-BAY-lay") culture.

And that's a tale that needs telling. For the past two years, the Greek story has, as one recent paper on economic policy put it, been "interpreted as a parable of the risks of fiscal profligacy." Not a day goes by without some politician or pundit intoning, with the air of a man conveying great wisdom, that we must slash government spending right away or find ourselves turning into Greece, Greece I tell you.
Moisturizer. Anything you apply to the skin is going to moisturize it — your sunscreen, your acne treatment, your anti-aging products — so a straight moisturizer tends to be the most overused, least necessary product.
The pinewood bar is the centerpiece of the cavernous Uptown room: Its U-shape connects the two storefronts that make up the cafe. It's a simple, open setup: bikes on one side, beverages and lounging on the other, but without full separation between the two areas. While one sips on the drinking side, the soft clinks and whirs of the bike shop become part of the background noise.

After a swing through northwestern Spain, we reentered Portugal from the east and stopped in Évora, a magnificently preserved city where we stayed at the U.S.-affiliated Best Western Hotel Santa Clara, for 60 euros, or about $83, a night. I was relieved to find that it was not a generic motel near an interstate but situated on a narrow alley in the ancient district near the town's central plaza. We soaked up Old World atmosphere within a few blocks of our doorstep, then drove west to the much older Cromeleque dos Almendres, a collection of big stones, arranged 2,000 years before Stonehenge.
Freese, when healthy, was a more than competent player last season, hitting .297 with 55 runs batted in for just 97 games. But now the bar of expectation probably has been raised a few notches by the fan base.

Now, much has happened since that election. The flawed policies and economic weaknesses of the previous decade culminated in the worst recession of our lifetimes. My hope was that the crisis would cause everyone, Democrats and Republicans, to pull together and tackle our problems in a practical way. But as we all know, things didn't work out that way. Some Republican leaders figured it was smart politics to sit on the sidelines and let Democrats solve the mess. Others believed on principle that government shouldn't meddle in the markets, even when the markets were broken. But with the nation losing nearly 800,000 jobs the month I was sworn in, my most urgent task was to stop a financial meltdown and prevent this recession from becoming a second depression.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's message will be welcome news for his host, President Barack Obama, who is seeking to rebalance the U.S. defense posture toward Asia. The American leader faces the challenge of countering China's rising military power and taming North Korea's nuclear ambitions even as the Pentagon's budget shrinks amid pressure for fiscal austerity. U.S. officials are counting on Japan, America's biggest ally in the region, to step up its own activities to enhance American clout.

The latest bad news for Toyota is the recall of 133,000 Prius hybrids and 14,500 Lexus HS250h cars in the U.S. to fix faulty brakes.

Few, if any, restaurants in California can compete with the history of 1833, named after the date its adobe house was built by John Stokes, a deserter from the British navy who masqueraded for years as a pharmacist and physician.
To stabilize the economy, the federal government needs to counterbalance the swings in consumer and business expenditures by moving in the opposite direction. When consumers and firms cut back, government can help replace the lost economic activity through direct spending (on infrastructure projects, for example) and through indirect means, such as tax cuts, which increase households' disposable income.

Meanwhile, the little fish are growing up in Chatfield, with adults currently averaging about 3 pounds and 16-17 inches long. That's a little smaller than the fish netted at Cherry Creek Reservoir, Kehmeier said. Biologists hauled up about three times as many adult walleyes on a given day than they did at Chatfield. Smallmouth bass still outnumber walleye at Chatfield by more than 2-to-1.

The merged giant would also "be able to design its formulary to divert patients to high-priced branded drugs instead of generic drugs" without fear of competition, it alleges.

Phish fans love to dance, and the aisles were choked with revellers from the first note of the three-hour show. The air inside the amphitheater was heavy with smoke, and listeners heaved handfuls of glow sticks in the air as the band played. This unofficial light show was amusing, but couldn’t hold a candle (or a glow stick) to the candy-store assortment of colored beams and gels onstage. The Phish light show has become one of rock’s most evocative. It heightens the psychedelic intensity of the jams, punctuates the instrumental passages, and eases the wild, noisy transitions between songs. Often, and to great effect, swirling colored lights would be swapped out with clear, direct white beams at the height of a solo. During "Possum," gold-colored light was splattered across the top of the amphitheater ceiling, making PNC look like a gigantic beehive. And at the show’s conclusion — the a cappella vocal jam that always follows Phish standard "You Enjoy Myself" — the lights strobed so furiously it looked as if the musicians were blurring into the air. For a moment, it was possible to imagine that they had done what they set out to do: They’d slipped away from the awful bonds of time and space and merged with infinite sound.

Oddly, they're not ideal for scenic designers. There's little of what's called fly space, overhead room to lift or drop large pieces of scenery. The Bowmer was built before the adjacent Elizabethan Stage was enclosed, and festival directors felt that a fly tower would too dominate the view for theatergoers.

The issue of identity is especially acute in "Torn" (7 p.m. Tuesday), a fascinating and at times tragic documentary about a Polish priest's attempt to be both Catholic and a practicing Jew after learning in adulthood that he was born to Jewish parents who died in the Holocaust. As he tries to find his true self, he is subjected to anti-Semitism in Poland, but encounters bureaucratic and theological roadblocks when he attempts to immigrate to Israel.
The questions, built on shaky assumptions, asked Obama if, for example, postelection flexibility "would lead you to impose even deeper cuts that will cripple our military?"

One part of the report can't be so easily muddied. It concerns data on searches - a police intervention that is much more intrusive than a vehicle stop. Black and Hispanic drivers in Missouri are searched by police at more than twice the rate of white drivers. Yet black and Hispanic drivers were found to be in possession of contraband much less frequently than whites.
"The biggest thing going into this whole transition into the NFL, I think, is preparation," Newton said. "I admire the guys like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, who are a professional at what they do.

While no system is truly perfect, the current Illinois system is the simplest to apply and is working well enough with room for deviations and judicial discretion over many issues, including time spent with the child. In contrast, the proposed model opens up whole new issues for battling parents: A calculation would be required regarding two incomes (or lack thereof) and the comparisons. The proposed model presents an unworthy motive to seek the worthy goal of more time with children in that it appears to trade "dollars for days," as more than one commentator has observed.

Second, supporters of the public bridge predict traffic volumes will rise to new peak levels in the next 25 years, leading to congestion unless capacity is added. This is a hotly disputed point. Moroun points out that the volume of border crossings plummeted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Traffic has been rising as the economy picks up, but it's still only a little more than half of the totals of the late 1990s. Passenger-car traffic is down more sharply than truck traffic, as more stringent border security measures apparently have discouraged casual visitors.

Deciding when to boost interest rates and reel in the unprecedented amount of money plowed into the U.S. economy will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Fed in the coming months.

"Oh, dear, giving up on a 162 game season after 4 games? Look, I tried to watch last night's game and was bored out of my mind waiting for the Indians to get something going on offense. But the other two losses were extra innings losses to what I think is a very good Blue Jays team. We got good starts out of Masterson, Ubaldo (who I'm very negative on, but will reserve judgment till the All Star break), and Lowe. Tomlin started rocky last night but settled in and gave the team a chance to win...if only they could get some offense.
And speaking of arrests: The gang is at a bar when a guy tries to provoke Pauly D. When he finds out that Pauly D isn't from New Jersey, he asks him, "So what do you know about Seaside?", but Pauly D doesn't bite. Later, the guy follows Ronnie and Sammi as they walk on the Boardwalk: "So where you from, Manhattan? Brooklyn? ... Go home to Staten Island where you belong!" Sammi lays the 30 insult on him, and tells the guy's girlfriend that her sundress looks like something her grandma would wear. Ronnie pushes Sammi away and tries to shut her up; he's clearly trying to avoid a confrontation. But the situation quickly devolves into "Come at me, bro!", "No, you come at me, bro!" The guy's girlfriend steps in between the two men, but not in any effort to quell the tension. She pushes Ronnie, who shoves her hand away. She goes after him again, and he pushes her hand away, then she does it a third and fourth time. The guy feints a lunge at Ronni, and then the two are on each other. Ronnie pretty quickly gets the upper hand and lands a few blows, while the guy's girlfriend and Sammi try to pull them apart. They're tangling for what seems like a good while -- we cut to The Situation getting a phone call about the fight and he and Pauly D rushing out of the house -- and then finally someone, likely an MTV bodyguard, pulls the two men apart. A police car arrives. Ronnie stalks away and brushes off Sammi when she tries to talk to him. He returns to the house, upends a table and fumes some more. Sammi arrives home, goes upstairs and cries to Snooki, "He pushed me and left me ... and walked home."

Yes, well, probably not. The truth is, no one at the time — not even, I should say, the editors of a certain homely, recently bankrupted newspaper called the Los Angeles Daily Times — had the slightest conception how the invention of the automobile would transform L.A. from the moseying hoof-and-heel town it was to the furiously hypertensive, drunk-with-mobility monster city it is today.

The U.S. has expressed its condolences for the deaths of the Pakistani soldiers at two Afghan border posts, but has stopped short of a full apology, likely because of domestic political considerations.

While I was there, I was able to help a non-profit organization, Zambia Hope International, that my parents started when I was just a little child. This organization tries to provide aid to the orphans that have been hit hard by the AIDS epidemic. Aside from farming and other manual work, I found another way to reach out to the children. I did this through the mutual love of sport we shared. The children were going through difficult times, but when we played soccer, that was hardly noticeable. It's a little hard to understand, but the amount of joy a simple ball was able to bring was spectacular."

I also felt the movie also did not address the tumultuous nature of Katniss' and Peeta's relationship to the extent that the novel did, choosing to address the couple's fights only briefly.

The Pennsylvania biker doesn’t exactly go through hell to mend his ways but, as based on a true story, we do get to watch how Childers emerges from life as a very nasty ex-con to become the titled man of God, even starting his own small backwoods congregation. At least, that’s the way director Marc Forster tells it, and Forster, after all, is the guy who put Halle Berry through her Oscar-winning paces in “Monster’s Ball” long before he almost made a shambles of the James Bond legacy in the Daniel Craig-pushed “Quantum of Solace.” (In fairness, Forster told much better stories in nicely handling “Finding Neverland” and “The Kite Runner.”)

Republicans are currently neither fat nor happy. But many conservatives feel betrayed by an administration and Congress that they believe veered from basic GOP principles on any number of economic, foreign policy and social matters.

The third movement simmered with bubbling energy. A few unclear entrances or less-than polished sounds escaped from the orchestra.

Granted, that could change. Racking up wins against the team's next several opponents, the Rangers, Rays and Yankees, would certainly help. As each day goes by, more and more people are beginning to notice. Even if it doesn't last, it's a kick to see the hometown team on top for once. They are scrappy foragers, these Birds with their DH pitchers, and we look forward to seeing what else they can do if given half a chance.
"While the specifics of the program are not altogether clear at this point, what is clear is that there's a recognition that there's something good going on in Northeast Ohio," said Brad Whitehead, president of the Fund for Our Economic Future in Cleveland.

Everything is so green!'" said Richardson, who as a Nike designer worked on the Oregon Ducks' streamlined "O" a decade ago and an update of the Denver Broncos' mark.
Romeny doesnt cut peoples hair off anymore. Hes not an anti-gay bully, but he does oppose same-sex marriage and still views the world through a tight lens. His campaign gaffes show much more than his scripted speeches. This is a guy who likes to fire people, doesnt care about poor people, and thinks $379,000 a year is little more than chump change.
"Bank of America will do the exact same thing now, except faster," said Don Barrett, partner at the Barrett Law Group, which is representing homeowners who seek to block the settlement.

Smooth ponytails were created by Redken creative consultant Guido Palau for a confident woman. Makeup, done by Tom Pecheux, created an elegant and timeless look, with a distinct black eyeliner in a slightly extended line.
The names on the plaques mirror basketball's incremental rise in popularity. They move from modest fame (no high Q scores here) — Naismith, Allen, Mikan, Wooden (as a player), Kurland, Russell (John D.) — to those easily recognized by the casual basketball fan — Auerbach, Cousy, Wooden (as a coach), Russell (Bill), Chamberlain, West, Baylor, Robertson, Reed, Maravich, Erving. The spotlight then shifts to names easily recognized by the casual sports fan — Abdul-Jabbar, Bird, Johnson, Thomas, Barkley, Ewing, Olajuwon, Jackson — and finally rests on one that has managed to transcend basketball and become an institution of popular culture — Jordan. The Honors Ring is markedly incomplete, however. A large swath of white space eagerly awaits another fifty some-odd years of basketball history.
TOM: And if that doesn’t work, you buy a car, and charge him the IRS-approved 55.5 cents a mile to ride with you.

Unlike previous proposals to privatize Medicare -- including one from Ryan earlier this year -- the new approach would be seeded with safeguards to guarantee minimum standards for care that would be approved by federal officials.

RE: Here's where we won't get fully to your satisfaction. You are not allowed to sit in all my senior staff meetings. And until that happens you will never be satisfied. That's my assumption based on this last 45 minutes that has been thoroughly enjoyable to me. You think you have a right to sit in here. I think I have a right to get unfettered honest opinions from my senior staff so that I can make decisions.

Things that turned Elliott's record into 13-19-8 the following season and got him traded to Colorado, where he won just two of 11 starts. Things that shrunk his save percentage to a frightful .891.

Edmundo Hidalgo, president and chief executive of Phoenix nonprofit Chicanos por la Causa, said that in previous years, McCain demonstrated a willingness to understand and work through issues affecting the Hispanic community.

Romney now regularly criticizes Obama's healthcare law as government overreach and an attack on American free enterprise.
Now, Washington sophisticates may interpret this two-step as a mere political feint to Obama's left - just another case of a president facing a difficult midterm and his own re-election, trying to placate the base. They don't take this withdrawal date too seriously.
A lack of cohesion on the field, a loss and a bit of postgame tension. Sound familiar?
Specifically, the suit claims that defendants American Broadcast Companies; Warner Horizon Television; Next Entertainment; NZK Productions and Michael Fleiss, the executive producer of "The Bachelor" and "Bachelorette" franchises, violated a 1981 law guaranteeing equal opportunities in business, commerce and media regardless of skin color.

OBAMA: Now supports legal recognition of same-sex marriage, a matter decided by states. Opposed that recognition in 2008 presidential campaign — and in 2004 Senate campaign — while supporting the extension of legal rights and benefits to same-sex couples in civil unions. Achieved repeal of the military ban on openly gay service members. Has not achieved repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and affirms the right of states to refuse to recognize such marriages. Administration has ceased defending the law in court but it remains on the books.

Pew's latest survey on the topic, in April, found that the views of young adults had been more or less stable in recent years and differed little from their elders.

The claim: Dan Webster "will cut your Social Security by over $1,000 a year." So says Alan Grayson, referring to an August forum when Webster said he wanted to "roll back cost of living adjustments" to 2007 levels. After a major hubbub arose, Webster said people misunderstood him — that he was referring to government salaries, not Social Security. Now, you can debate his sincerity. But the bottom line is Webster has repeatedly said he never meant to cut Social Security payments — and, more important, has vowed not to.
It's only one day a year the Muskegon and Rockford get together on the football field. For the head coaches, they may wish it was a different day. Both teams a really banged up heading into the game.

The insurance requirement is widely viewed as crucial to other consumer protections in the law, including the guarantee that everyone can get health insurance.

Mr. Santorum, who hasn't endorsed Mr. Romney, expects to sit down with the presumed GOP nominee on May 4, according to John Brabender, Mr. Santorum's chief strategist.
Coach Lovie Smith wasn't ready to replace the Packers with the Lions as the Bears' No. 1 nemesis. As Smith said, "You can only have one true rival." Fair enough. But there is no mistaking that the Lions series has been ratcheted up several notches with play that comes right up to the line and crosses it at times. It started last season and continued in a big way with seven personal fouls in this messy affair. With some of the young players involved, this could be the beginning of juicy storylines for years to come. It happens when teams don't like one another.
Dogs also risk heat stroke when they overexert themselves, especially overweight or brachycephalic dogs such as pugs or boxers that can't breathe efficiently to begin with, Welker says.
So why not the Browns? I can think of crazier ideas, but maybe that's because I just remembered ESPN is paying Keyshawn Johnson to say, "The Green Packers must protect Aaron Rodgers and the receivers have to catch the football."
The Spears tour was responsible for the cost of setting up the show, the arena’s stagehands and production crew, as well as the cost of backstage catering. Those expenses cost the tour $91,450 for one night — a big number, but the staging was more complicated than most shows, officials said.
One name that should have been on that mentor list is Heston Blumenthal of England's Fat Duck restaurant. Parker was supposed to work for him, but, thanks to a suitcase full of knives, he couldn't get through customs in London. He didn't have a work visa, because the stint at Fat Duck wasn't a paid position - he just wanted to learn. Long story short, British customs agents were incredulous that he would work for no money, so they sent him back to California.

Down another path lies an even more unpredictable Republican drama. A Santorum victory in one or both of the Feb. 28 primaries would virtually guarantee a prolonged, and potentially damaging, struggle into early June, when California holds its delegate-rich primary, and could conceivably go all the way to the Republican National Convention in Tampa at the end of August.
Obama goes after Sen. Clinton in a different fashion. He has accused her of equivocating on policy positions. He has also voiced doubts that she would bring about real change, dismissing a Hillary Clinton presidency as "Bush-Cheney lite."
That new development came the same day Hancock Place was set to roll up its tax rate by 61 cents to the voter approved maximum.

What's missing from the dressing room: groupies, bling and that we're-about-to-trash-this-place vibe. What you get instead: a small table set with a few glasses and a bottle of the band's Save Me, San Francisco wine, which they are making in concert with ACME Wine Movers, a newly formed division of The Wine Group.

Said executive producer Randy Douthit, who has been with "Judge Judy" since its launch, "Byrd underplays it, and it works for the show. He's a big guy, and he plays the attitude of a real court officer. No one told him to act that way — it just comes naturally."

Achef in full white uniform approaches you at your seat and explains the menu, asking about your likes and dislikes.

He also said he thought the Cavs were committed to winning, but that he and his team 'had a game plan.'
They almost did just that. Favre suffered a serious ankle injury that night and was too hobbled to pull out the game in the end, throwing an interception instead. Saints defensive end Bobby McCray was fined $20,000 after two improper hits on Favre in that game, and Favre told Sports Illustrated's Peter King that he thought others should have been fined, too.

The divide within the party has been stark. Romney has not won a primary in a state where evangelical Christians made up more than half the GOP electorate, nor has he lost one in a state where evangelicals made up less than half the electorate.

Eight years into the war on terror, military wives are aces at anticipatory grief. The possibility of loss was introduced so early in my marriage, it may as well have been an attendant at the wedding. Immediately after our brief predeployment ceremony at city hall, my husband made sure I had our marriage certificate safely stored, as well as his will. While he was at war, I mentally rehearsed his funeral a hundred times, right down to the psalms and the finish on the casket fittings. And many of us Army wives, in the recesses of our closets, have stashed a black dress, just in case -- if not for our own husband's funeral, then someone else's. The military preaches readiness, after all, and, we reason, if tragedy comes, we may not handle ourselves perfectly in the abyss of grief, but damn it, we'll be prepared.

The most important in 1987 was the Libyan National Salvation Front (LNSF) formed in October 1981….The LNSF claimed responsibility for the daring attack on Gaddafi’s headquarters at Bab al Aziziyah on May 8, 1984.

The concept of "American exceptionalism" is not new -- French historian Alex de Tocqueville espoused such a sentiment in the 1800s. There is disagreement about when the phrase itself was coined, but it may have come from liberal political scientist Louis Hartz in the 1950s.

Jonah Hill, as Peter Brand, the visibly fidgety statistician, is a revelation, too. The overweight, over-perspiring dork of Superbad and Funny People pushes his twitchy awkwardness in uncharted directions, and the interplay between Pitt and Hill's characters - as the two embark on their crackpot mission - is something to behold. One great sequence, set on trade-deadline day, has Beane working the phones, playing one general manager off another, while Brand mugs, mimes, and offers counsel. The breathless bidding culminates with Hill delivering a totally dweeby - and exquisitely triumphant - fist pump.

Finally, when our politicians lose, they actually leave office. Banda became the first president of Malawi in 1964, swept into office by the euphoria of Malawi's independence from Britain. Yet he didn't leave office until 30 years later, and along the way he declared himself "President for Life." In recent years, Bakili Muluzi, the first democratically elected president of Malawi, has displayed similar ambitions. After serving two terms (the maximum allowed by the Malawian Constitution), he filed numerous court challenges to secure an opportunity to run for election again. Thankfully, he lost.

A 6-foot-2 scoring machine, Izevbuwa averaged 17 points per game during the regular season in a variety of ways: from the perimeter, off the dribble and even inside. The uncommitted senior will likely land at prep school and then a Division I program after that if all goes as expected.

Prop. 29 ignores these ballot-box errors and asks voters to do it again. We all agree cancer research and tobacco prevention - the measure's stated goals - are important.
