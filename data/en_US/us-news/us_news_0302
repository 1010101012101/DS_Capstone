Aside from being an extraordinary word to say out loud, this preparation has culinary benefits as well. By removing the backbone and keel bone (the one between the breasts), the chicken can be flattened yet still stay intact (see instructions on spatchcocking a chicken, this page).

But Reed and the firefighters don't have an actuarial study – an accounting report of the financial impact of the changes over 30 years – to prove their plan actually saves that much cash.
This is an episode of presidential malpractice. Obama has allowed NATO to be employed for the advancement of a half-baked doctrine (R2P -- "responsibility to protect"), a quarter-baked rationalization (was it just in March that Hillary Clinton discovered that a vital U.S. national interest required the removal of Moammar Gaddafi because he "is a man who has no conscience"?) and an unworthy national agenda (France's pursuit of grandeur on the cheap).

Fiennes’ adaptation (done with veteran playwright and screenwriter John Logan) makes much of that relationship; it’s clear that Coriolanus has been bred for battle since the nursery.

In any event, the diversion of some cargo to all-water routes through Panama does not necessarily mean that fewer goods will be moving through the West Coast.

But as so often happens when Big Business -- in this case, Hollywood and the Recording Industry Association of America -- runs to Big Government for protection, over kill is always just around the corner.

HILARIOUS: "Bee Movie" is a fun and adventurous film that people of all ages should enjoy. Don't mistake this as entirely a children's film, either. While the target audience may appear to be kids, almost all of the film's humor is actually complex or referential, and kids won't get most of the jokes. That certainly isn't to say that they won't enjoy the film, with its pleasant visuals, amusing characters, and "silly" humor. All performances are excellent and the cameos are great. The only downside is most of the film feels very rushed.

"Playing quarterback in our scheme is not too daunting of a task," Alabama center William Vlachos said. "You've got the best running back in the country (Trent Richardson) behind you. It's kind of one of those deals where you really do just manage the game. You need a decision maker. You need to not put us in bad spots. But that's something our quarterbacks are trained to do, and AJ's done a great job of that."

Here's a suggestion: Let's tackle consolidation as an issue of government efficiency and fairness, period. We have unnecessary duplication of some services, such as the sheriff's departments and court systems in both city and county, and we have inadequate provision of other services, such as police protection in some of St. Louis County's smaller municipalities. If a merger can save money in some places and deliver better services in others, then it should go forward. Otherwise, why bother?

Part III: Fighting off the backlash: Last year, hostility bubbled across the state and country as a slew of nonpartisan critical reports slammed the project. Brown appointed Richard, a former PG&E executive, and ex-Bank of America Vice President Mike Rossi to overhaul the plan again in November. Hoping to win over critics with blunt honesty, they pushed the cost to the $99 billion-to-$117 billion range, delayed the start of full service from 2020 to 2034, lowered projected rider estimates and profits again, and conceded funding wasn't coming anytime soon. It backfired: Republicans singled out the project as a boondoggle and moved to ax it while a majority of polled voters agreed.

Plenty of families opt for adults to watch their children. But I think it's great that plenty more still look to the local teenager. I'm only 17, and I have a 9-year-old sibling, so I assume it is easier for me to relate to the kids. Lately, that's been proving to be false. Technology has had a large impact on kids; they are not who I was when I was their age. It's so odd to think that the kids I baby-sit know more about technology than I do.

For most of these On the Job Training stories, I try to start at 9 a.m. or so. For the Buckeye Brewing OJT, Garin asked me to be at the brewery by 8 a.m. I was, surprisingly enough.

So it's difficult to clearly say what he was looking for in a piano, because the sound he was seeking maybe was more in his head. But from people's letters, we know he was very happy with his Broadwood, probably because it was a little bit louder than the other pianos he knew, and maybe he could feel the vibrations.

But the real fascination lies in Turner's zany juxtapositions of eclectic furniture, collections and art. His Monterey-style furniture, fabricated by Mason Manufacturing for Barker Bros. from 1929 through the mid-'40s, dominates most of the rooms. Because Turner can't abide theme rooms with "everything matching," he adds conversation pieces -- a 1992 Cappellini chaise longue upholstered in albino crocodile, for instance, or a resin deer head that glows in the dark, or a grouping of eye-popping, vintage Blenko glass.
Christie accused legislators who do not support the scholarship act of being "owned by special interests" and likened opposing the program to "a sin." If the bill ever reaches his desk, Christie has pledged to sign it without delay.

Though more ratings are being appealed, the MPAA is showing little inclination to reconsider its rulings. All but one of the appeals for 2012 movies failed in their bid for a lower rating; the one successful appeal was for Lionsgate's high-school romance "The Perks of Being a Wallflower," which was changed from an R to a PG-13. By contrast, nearly 50% of appeals were successful in 2010 and 2011.

Reeves, 15, grew up as an all-baseball, all-the-time guy. He tinkered here and there with other sports. But golf, basketball and everything else were just things to fill the time between baseball games and practices.
It's almost surprising that it took us this long to figure it out. Really, what's not to love? On a purely functional level, cupcakes are portable, they're small, and they're easily personalized. But it goes even deeper than that. From an emotional standpoint, they hark back to our childhood, and in so doing they seem to make us sublimely happy.
Gardner, whose company celebrated its one year anniversary March 1, started out in just one store, a place called Grab It in Lee’s Summit.

In its response to the FCC last year, AT&T said the decision to block the app was made entirely by Apple. But the carrier also revealed that under its agreement with Apple, it restricted use of Internet calling services on the iPhone -- allowing such calls only over Wi-Fi connections. Those connections generally have limited mobility and therefore present less of a competitive threat to AT&T's core wireless calling business.
The film fell through the cracks because its distributor recast it as a blaxploitation flick, retitling it "My Main Man From Stony Island." "It was devastating," Davis said. "The movie was about music being a common language and race being transcended by the love of music. This is nothing new. Racism is still a big part of our life. I thought this could break through. This was before hip-hop and rap. But look at the headlines today. It's very timely."

Like Scott Baio, who was victimized by a similar prank a few days ago, Jon Bon Jovi seemed unnerved by the barrage of Twitter rumors. He referred to the hoax several times, and even pantomimed taking phone calls from concerned friends checking to see if he was still alive. He even felt the need to rehash the old Mark Twain quip about how the reports of his death had been exaggerated.

The other, which could have even broader consequences, would allow corporations to become liquor agents. The idea is to make it easier for big grocery chains, such as Safeway or Fred Meyer, to open "store within a store" liquor outlets.

During his teenage years, Bin Laden also went on family vacations to Denmark, Sweden and Britain.
Police have good reason to want to know what to expect when protesters take to the streets. Many big cities, such as Seattle in 1999, Cincinnati in 2001 and Toledo in 2005, have seen protests turned into violent, destructive riots. Intelligence from undercover officers gives police an idea of what to expect and lets them plan accordingly.

One heated debate arose over the two-year term length for representatives, some feeling it was too long for them to be in office "without going back to the people for reelection." Fisher Ames, a Federalist delegate to the convention, countered, "biennial elections provided an essential security to liberty" by preventing decisions based on a "factionalism and enthusiasm. The people always mean right, and if time is allowed for reflection and information, they will do right." Biennial elections provided, a "security that the sober, second thought of the people shall be law."

Up until that time, he'd made his living selling industrial packaging. In the early 1980s he and his buddies began to brew beer, and at one point he toyed with the notion of becoming a commercial brewer.

The bank, in which the government holds an 82 percent stake following its near-collapse in 2008, on Thursday reported a worse-than-expected net loss of 2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) for 2011, compared with a loss of 1.13 billion pounds the previous year.

The conservative thing to do -- and I don't mean politically conservative -- is to send the whole thing back to Congress and have it done right. Leaving aside the fact that Obamacare largely falls apart if you remove the mandate, it's not the Supreme Court's job to design our health care system from the scraps Congress dumps in its lap. What Justice Ginsburg proposes is akin to a student handing in a sloppy, error-filled term paper, and the professor rewriting it so as to give the student an A.

One argument made by supporters of Proposition 8 to the 9th Circuit was that marriage is inherently about procreation. But this is wrong because heterosexual couples can marry even if one or both of the partners is physically incapable of having children or if they do not wish to do so.

We hope the dwindling number of you who defend the legislative scholarships will join your leaders in accepting that, at best, the program has become a distraction — and a political liability — in a state with massive financial problems.

Some evolutionary psychologists emphasize the benefits of what we label as disorders. For example, Edward H.

Such stories didn't happen overnight. The relic cult, as Freeman describes it, was a gradual evolution, begun in the darkest days of the persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire. Martyrdom wasn't just horrifying, it was debasing: Spectators watched and cheered as victims were stripped, tortured and burned to death or devoured by animals. Early Christians saw a link between this suffering and Christ's on the cross — torture and death became a holy, purifying experience. No pain, no heavenly gain.

He feels the need to widen the range of his experiences by dropping out of school and going off with some pals on a long road trip to South America. "I don't want to be dependent on you," he tells her, adding later, "you have to live your own life as well." The extent of Camille's passion almost unnerves him — he can't imagine that kind of romantic focus, and he is not always sympathetic to how hard this separation is going to be for her.

It's still sparse -- not much more than a half-dozen brick-red booths staring out onto César Chávez Avenue -- but Antojitos Carmen the restaurant is home nevertheless. After two decades spent hunched over sidewalk fryers, the Ortega family was recently able to move its operation indoors.

Obese kids today are already beset with the health problems facing obese 25-year-olds. Just recently, a new study found that type 2 diabetes, the variety associated with obesity, has started cropping up at an alarming rate in kids. The situation is only exacerbated by the increasing lack of activity in American lives, but especially in kids, who become hooked at an early age on TV, computers and social media. Even if children and teens could be motivated to engage in some kind of physical activity, many schools have eliminated gym classes, and poor neighborhoods often lack any kind of park area for kids to play in.
