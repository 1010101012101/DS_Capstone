On the other hand, "Uncertainty about future economic conditions remains high while consumer confidence levels are at historic lows, with many households reporting they are living from one paycheck to the next," he said.
The Buckalews, too, were remembered as a devoted and generous couple. Both came from the South. Jeffrey Buckalew’s father, Vardaman Moore Buckalew, is a nephrologist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. and Corinne (Stickley) Buckalew is a descendant of a long line of Tennesseans, including a Confederate captain in the Civil War.
Ascending 2,500 feet over three miles is the only way to get close to the milk-white tip of Quartz Peak. In this remote and rugged terrain, hikers are more likely to spot a bighorn sheep than a human being.
"I think they understand that if we don't win all three (games left), we don't have much of a chance (at the NCAA tournament) outside of winning the Pac-12 tournament," Altman said. "We just have to go play Oregon State and let things take care of themselves. It's the end of the season, lots of people talk about different things, so you've just got to make sure you focus."
SPARTANBURG, S.C. — Republican presidential hopefuls criticized President Barack Obama's efforts to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions tonight but disagreed in campaign debate whether the United States would be justified in a pre-emptive military strike.
A trial court ruled Avalon had taken control of the lot in 1962, but an appellate court reversed that decision in 2007. The following year, the borough admitted it took the property in 1962, but said it didn’t owe the Klumpps any money because the statute of limitations had expired.
Panetta reminded troops that they are representing the American people and they must live up to strict military standards. “These days, it takes only seconds for one picture to suddenly become an international headline,” the former California congressman said, standing in front of one of the most battle-hardened units in the Army, the “Hammer brigade” of the 3rd Infantry Division.
* If the Cardinals (as expected) close on that long-term contract extension with Molina, the price will be high but it's a positive move for the team and the future. Molina is more than just an elite catcher. He's a big part of the Cardinals' spine. He's a big part of the team's collective competitive personality. Pitchers hold Yadi in such high regard, it's like having a coach behind the plate.
 Next season: It will be easier to establish a rotation after a full offseason and training camp. And he'll have to figure out how to improve the defense after another down year at that end of the court.
While tourism has increased globally over the last decade, the U.S. slice of those travelers has fallen, due in large part to complicated visa procedures and heightened security that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. The 10 years after the attacks are often referred to as the "lost decade" for U.S. tourism, because new procedures drove millions of international travelers to other countries.
"We didn't get it done at the end," Miller said.
Last week, Christie laid out a slew of changes — some he has been talking about for months — including limiting pensions and benefits for current workers, capping worker raises at 2.5 percent, and the property tax cap.

not only the first sub.-500 team to make the playoffs but the first to win a game. But now it goes on the road, where it's 2-6 and wasn't competitive in its losses - the closest was a 15-point defeat. But 1 of the road wins came vs. the Bears, who were unbalanced - 39 passes, 17 runs - and gave up 6 sacks in that Oct.

In person, she compensated with charm - all heavy-lidded eyes, smoldering heartache and operatic warbling served with a knowing smirk. The gaggle of photographers in the front row hardly fazed her, nor did the presence of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak handing out business cards at the side of the stage. Backed by a pianist and guitar player, Del Rey casually draped her smoky voice around the longing themes of songs like "Born to Die" and "Blue Jeans" as if she had been singing them forever.

The problems started with an unusual accumulation of ice crystals in the airplane's three pitot tubes, probes that measure speed by capturing the pressure of the oncoming air. Losing reliable airspeed information, the autopilot turned the airplane over to its human minders, as it was designed to do. For some reason -- perhaps he thought the speed was too high -- the pilot who was flying the airplane pulled it up into a climb, rapidly gaining several thousand feet. This in turn led to an aggravated stall.
So it's trying something it is calling the Christmas Price Guarantee. It works this way: If you buy something at Wal-Mart from Nov. 1 to Dec. 25 and find the identical product elsewhere for less, you get a gift card in the amount of the difference.

Rather than ignore the rantings of just one of its 30,000 employees, Goldman put its communications machine into over-drive. A memo from CEO Lloyd Blankfein even outlined the fact that 89 percent of the 85 percent of Goldman employees who responded to a company survey said they believe the firm provides excellent service to its clients. Huh? By my math that means 25 percent of Goldmanites don’t believe that to be the case, or were too lazy to vote. No matter, the firm continued its pattern of protesting too much.
Wilson left an 0-1 pitch up in the zone and Renteria made him pay for the mistake by driving it into the left-field seats. Renteria had gone 53 straight at-bats without a home run since connecting off the Los Angeles Dodgers' Ted Lilly on Sept. 4 and had not homered at AT&T Park since July 27 against Florida's Brian Sanches.

Some of the preparation, including the selection and packing of ingredients making the trip from Oregon, was handled in Portland. Much of the rest, including butchery and sauces, happened the day before at A Voce, whose chef was also named a Food & Wine magazine best new chef, and whom Lightner met at an event for this year's class in Aspen, Colo. Among the work at A Voce was assembling the herbs and greens array for each dish -- a Lightner trademark -- each meticulously portioned into four sets of 60 small plastic containers, each container including a small square of damp paper to prevent its ingredients from drying out.

There's not much in the bare-bones decor and ambience of Kurata to distract you from the food. The folks serving the handful of tables and the four seats at the sushi bar are businesslike and efficient, occasionally too efficient. It's not unknown for everything you order to show up pretty much at once, producing a jam-up that could have you looking around for more table space -- which in a place this small and popular won't often be available.

His rejuvenation has rubbed off on his bandmates. It wasn’t long ago that guitarist Nils Lofgren had both hips replaced; at the Izod Center, he took a long, wild, imaginative solo during "Because the Night" while gyrating and hopping in circles on one leg. Drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent gave the impression that they could play another two and a half hours without dropping a stitch. Charlie Giordano, the accordionist and organist who is filling Federici’s chair, had a particularly strong night, adding vivid color to "The E Street Shuffle" and a soul medley that included the Smokey Robinson-written "The Way You Do the Things You Do" and the Wilson Pickett hit "634-5789."

Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi is scheduled to arrive in India next week.
K-12 public education is partially to blame. During the late 1960s, a sense emerged that the performance of high schools had declined — judging from the reasoning, English and math skills of college freshman, employers were probably right.
Although he's known for blisteringly fast fingering and a deep interest in Hawaiian music history, today Makana is more likely to be playing protest music, as he did at the recent heads of state dinner during the APEC meeting in Honolulu, and then at Occupy Honolulu (for details, see my Hawaii Insider blog.)

The numbers told part of that story. In the first 21/2 months of 2008, Donnelly and Achilli exchanged 632 phone calls, a little less than nine a day. Over the same period, she exchanged 425 calls with Garcia. But it veered toward the one-sided: Garcia called her 271 times. She called him 154 times.
In recent months, U.S. counterterrorism officials have come to see Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and one of its leaders, U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, as perhaps a bigger immediate threat to the U.S. The CIA and Special Operations teams have been searching for Mr. Awlaki but lack good intelligence on his whereabouts, officials say.

Editor's note: Some of the best jobs require skills in math, science, technology and engineering, but local business leaders and educators are concerned that there will not be enough students interested in those subjects to meet demand. These skills are vital in Orange County, home to many rising and established technology companies.

Next show: 1993, back at Radio City Music Hall, for the first night of a five-show stand. “I Will Always Love You” had become her biggest hit the previous year. Once again, the focus was on singing, not theatrics, and I enjoyed the show very much. She performed just fragments of some of her hits to make room for some more gospel, and a powerful version of the anthem of determination, “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” (from “Dreamgirls”).

Day 2 of the draft was highlighted by plenty of risky business. They passed on several first-round opportunities to land more well-known pass-catching commodities in favor of a highly productive receiver from a smaller school who some draft analysts compare with a Terrell Owens. Then they followed that up with the selection of a couple of talented cornerbacks with potential character issues in Janoris Jenkins and Trumaine Johnson, which gives the Rams the rare distinction of being potentially the first team in NFL history to select two players in the same draft who have both been on the business end of a police stun gun.
The cake layers are all-natural, not a speck of chemically treated flour in the batter. The buttercream has all real butter, and the fresh rose topper is organic and fragrant, a dazzler that comes in many colors. All of this is what you expect from a natural foods purveyor, with polished elegance as a plus. We loved the moist cake but would have liked a spike of lemon in our raspberry filling and a frosting recipe without a slick mouth feel at the finish. But you try it; there are plenty of options, including whipped cream, chocolate mousse and cream cheese.

Convinced of his team's talent, DeWitt shares concerns about its potential frailty. A mix of younger players who never have played 100 games in a major-league season (David Freese and Allen Craig) and veterans with a complex recent medical history (Beltran, Rafael Furcal and Berkman) represent this season's X-factor.
UC San Diego officials said the TAG proponents have it all wrong.

You don't go to a summer blockbuster movie looking for a plot and you shouldn't expect much of a story from the Transformers ride. The seemingly never-ending ride queue offers a backstory for the uninitiated, which essentially amounts to another chapter in the never-ending war between the good-guy Autobots and the bad-guy Decepticons.
Thank goodness, then, for the classic inspirations of Spain and for purists such as Antelo.

Ramirez, who is the same age as Alfaro, said he told her he was part of MS-13, a violent Central American gang, and had a new tattoo of two dice, one that had a "1" on it, the other that had a "3." Prosecutors say Alfaro and the five other young men charged in the killing were all tied to MS-13, and that the killing was gang-motivated.

In the fall of 2009, the pair made four trips to Mexico to buy one or two kilos of heroin at a time, Bement said. At the peak of his business, Bement testified that his own income was about $17,000 a week and $67,000 a month. From that, he said, he paid Greenspan about $15,000 a month on his investment.

The Clippers sounded annoyed and dedicated to improving themselves in the next nine days. And I know the bar has been much higher in prior years with the Blazers (read: trying to beat the Los Angeles team with all the world titles), but Portland is a more experienced, more complete team than the Clippers and should be 4-0 today save for dribbling the ball off their feet, or throwing it out of bounds in front of all those horrified people.

Vicki Berger, a 58-year-old Republican representative from Salem, was one of the 10 tested. Society needs to carefully weigh the costs and benefits of products and seek more scientific study, she said, not impose "willy nilly" bans.
The last thing any enterprise wants is for some government snoop to start minding its business - issuing subpoenas, taking depositions, filing charges, driving up costs. On the theory that the best offense is a good defense, modern sports moguls have taken pains to dispense swift, pre-emptive justice as a means of maintaining jurisdiction. Yet several recent cases should cause district attorneys to weigh weighing in on in-game violence, perhaps in the form of indictments.

What had I wanted from my trip to China? To engage in one of the oldest continuous cultures on our Earth? To sense what modern China might offer? I'd been shocked by the number of old women who begged for money. I'd felt sad seeing the charmless cities where architecture's old bones had been sacrificed for graceless apartments and impressive monuments. But I'd also been amazed at the warmth of China's people.

The business is driving the basketball. Not the other way around. And there's a tremendous ongoing power play among the personalities below Allen.

Though there are many themes coursing through this movie, its primary concern is how anyone copes with a loss like this one. The filmmakers dive into the deep end as soon as we've gotten to know the boy who becomes the totem for our collective pain. In Oskar's case it's the loss not only of a father, but his best friend. In Hanks' hands, Thomas is kind, funny, clever and fascinated by his son. He also becomes the film's primary source of comfort.
The challenge for teams like Ohio State, Michigan State and Wisconsin, three of the best defensive teams in the country, is to continue to lock down on that end of the court while hoping for some more breathing room offensively.

Mexico lures many with its legal drinking age of 18, rather than the usual 21 in the U.S. And tour operators and resort companies woo students by assembling packages that bundle airfare, lodging, meals, access to "VIP" rooms and often drinks as well. Wander into any spring-break zone and you'll find that even the most scantily clad celebrants are sporting color-coded plastic bracelets to affirm their party privileges. (And even if spring-breakers don't buy a tour operator's package, in Mexico they're likely to find clubs that charge $25 to $35 for admission, then serve beer at no charge.)

some expected based on the 18 games the Cardinals and Brewers played against each other the regular season. A few of those became beanball exchanges, and all of them had a certain edge. This series has lacked a bit of that feistiness -- lustily booing Nyjer Morgan is about as chippy as the Busch crowd has gotten so far -- but the Gomez slide and now Zack Greinke plunking David Freese could be adding some cayenne to these churchy festivities.
City Hall’s real estate sweepstakes: Downtown developers are looking for tenants, any tenants, to fill a new office project. The city, it just so happens, may be in the market for new office space. The Bureau of Planning & Sustainability and the Bureau of Development Services live in the city’s 1900 S.W. Fourth Ave. building, a short walk south of City Hall. Portland State University would like to take over the building. So, the two bureaus may at some point need a home. Leonard has been in talks with developer Brad Malsin about potentially moving the BDS to a project at the east end of the Burnside Bridge. The Bureau of Environmental Services, now in the Portland Building next door to City Hall, may be in the market, too. Developers Jim Winkler and Bob Naito have been trying for years to break ground on a PDC-backed project called One Waterfront Place just north of the Broadway Bridge. The word around the building is that Winkler is trying to recruit BES to help anchor his building. All of this and more will be on the table at a council work session at 2 p.m. Thursday. Office space planning has always been a challenge for the city given that each bureau answers to a different elected leader and they typically don’t coordinate their moves well. The work session is an attempt, for now at least, to improve that coordination.

Because it’s going to be like this over and over again.’ But I did (want it), and eventually started auditioning for commercials. And I hated that, because the corny improvs they made the kids do were mortifying and really, I couldn’t sell anything. I kept getting rejected.”

Aniston, making a small recovery from the horrendous “The Bounty Hunter,” looks pert and pretty (she may be the best-groomed woman in Hollywood — I picture flights of stylists hovering around her like cartoon bluebirds, each one armed with a hot comb and a pumice stone).

Goodell has said that time and again, but the commissioner remains an employee. A powerful employee, for sure, but he has 32 bosses, and if one of those captains wants to sail away - as we've seen with the Raiders, Cardinals, Browns, Colts and Oilers/Titans - there's really not much he can do about it. Except these franchises are running out of places to move where they'll build zillion-dollar stadiums.

A study by a Harvard University professor and an analyst from investment banking firm Barclay's Capital found that endorsement deals on average generate a 4 percent increase in company sales.
The success of Barrie's "Peter Pan," combined with the author's shyness, provided an instance of what could be called the Sherlock Holmes phenomenon, in which an author creates a fictional character and universe that overwhelms the reality of his life. It is this peculiar confluence of reality and fantasy, of imagination and reputation that "Finding Neverland" tries to explore, settling, it seems to me, for tears rather than illumination. The more I pondered "Finding Neverland," artfully directed by Marc Forster and based on Allan Knee's stage play, the more I realized that my inner biographer hungered for the full panoply of Barrie's rich life, and that no movie, no matter how artful, could sketch it all in.

I am very impressed with our education system and how it is working. And the teachers that work with students are so supportive and constructive." For science teacher Ryan Reidy, the highlight of Senior Exhibition is to see the growth of the students from early freshman days through senior year. "To watch someone progress from a shy and quiet student, to a confident and animated public speaker - that is the payback for doing what we do."

You could say that Granatell’s role on the show is that of an enabler, gamely indulging in Staub’s whims (including a surprise session with a stripper-pole instructor; “I was a spaz,” Granatell admits) and alternately feeding and discouraging Staub’s more self-destructive impulses, which is to say, all of them.
The pair promises devotional material, R&B, jazz and seasonal music at their Friday night show in Newark. "It’s still the gospel message in different flavors," says CeCe. "Praise is the reason for everything we do, and we do it with all that we have."

The unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey of households, was forecast to climb to 8.7 percent, according to the survey median.

The labor force was little changed.

The cassoulet stuck to a more expected presentation: confit duck leg, a link of garlic sausage and a square of braised bacon. The saucy beans were underdone, so after a couple bites I figured I could take it home, reheat it the next day and have a good lunch.

Gartland took responsibility for his actions but also appeared to mitigate his own wrongdoing.
By now, you are probably wondering: where is the Big Boi album? Well, it's here, sad to say. It never clicked for me, and I'm not entirely sure why. I always love Big Boi's rhyming, and some of the individual tracks are fantastic, but I find the second half of the record a real chore. I admit that I could never get into the tracks with Janelle Monae and Jamie Foxx, and they're back to back, and right after that there's the George Clinton song that I don't understand. I zone out around there and only re-engage when "Shine Blockas" comes on, and that type of thing never happened with an OutKast set. I adore them to pieces, and I will happily pay money for anything they put out, but I'm convinced now -- Andre and Antawn really do need each other.
The recent switch from elementary and middle schools to K-8 schools in about half the district, for example, left teachers and parents saying the district has created a two-tiered system in which only certain kids have access to a full range of classes and other opportunities.

Loyd's company, Aspen Tree Homes, would serve as general contractor.

A senior catcher, Duran proved to be a tough out in victories over Escondido, Vista and San Pasqual. Not only did Duran go 6-for-11, she sent three pitches where no one could catch them - over the fence - in a span of four at-bats, collecting six RBI and powering the Titans to the triumphs.
� "I think what we're beginning to get through to (the federal government) on, is if you've got a serious criminal opponent, treat them that way.

At the same time, Kaplan said that the device's one-year design life may limit its effectiveness as a long-term solution to obesity and diabetes. By giving a diabetic's pancreas a year to rest, it may improve a patient's long-term outlook, he speculated. And some patients, he added, may benefit from having the device implanted over and over, with a break in between. But such possibilities have yet to be demonstrated in clinical trials, he cautioned.
The government also plans to lend Chrysler $4 billion more when it leaves bankruptcy, bringing the federal tab to $11.5 billion, about the amount the company asked for from Congress last year.

The implementation of a commercial composting program will depend in part on how many participants sign on.

Of course the initiative goes beyond the agents. Delta officials say too often last summer, flights were canceled because planes weren't repaired fast enough due to a lack of parts and workers.

All that should put workers in position to deliver better service.

Renner's biggest immediate challenge may be handling the fame that comes from starring in blockbuster movies.
Edwards, who had three receptions for 79 yards, is looking for a lucrative contract after this season, and plays like that won't help his cause. The talented wide receiver showed everybody yesterday exactly why he is such a tantalizing talent and yet such a frustrating player at the same time. After failing to record a catch in the first half, Edwards made a 41-yard catch-and-run on his first reception, only to fumble the ball at midfield with 8:11 remaining in the third quarter.

"Afro-Colombian culture is more visible, not least because the people are more visible," said professor Juan Camilo Cardenas of the University of the Andes in Bogotá.

Annie is as engaging as she is generous, full of opinions earned by living life at full throttle, even when she was scared to death. And that is a crucial truth about Annie Glenn.

Bottled water enriched with whey protein may be the drink of the future--a painless means of weight control. New Zealand researchers found that even small amounts of whey dissolved in water and consumed two hours before lunch reduced hunger in overweight women. All 46 participants reported feeling more full and satisfied than after consuming a whey-free control drink. The greater the concentration of whey, the stronger and longer the effect. Although none of the women ate less lunch two hours later, higher whey doses may thwart dessert consumption.

If you wondered why the aldermen usually supported whatever Daley set before them, now you can appreciate one important reason: His administration had bought their servitude by engineering pensions beyond their wildest expectations. This happened during the same period when — as we wrote last fall — Daley was consolidating power for his first mayoral re-election campaign in 1991.
In a country that is accustomed to majority government, it is the first time Britain has had peacetime coalition rule since the 1930s, though it has had several minority governments in that time.
"People don't like to go to the painful part," said Spencer. "But the only way we can grow and heal is to acknowledge that pain. Once we stop looking at 'it takes a white girl,' we need to take a look at the fact that it's these women who came together to do something huge in their small community. I'm a realist — we live in a multifaceted, multicultural world, and maybe if we stop labeling ourselves, everyone else will."

Landowners and environmentalists in the region mounted a fierce campaign to block three proposals to build LNG import terminals in Oregon, including the one in Coos Bay. They insisted all along there was no need for imported gas and now say backers are pulling a bait and switch by converting to export projects.

And Georgia has a law that says courts may order parents to attend conferences at school and to participate in programs designed to improve the student's behavior. Failure to comply can result in fines of up to $500.
Only a trickle of laughter sprouted; most were like my friends and I, just stunned. This was only the final nail in Sinquefield's diatribe of false accusations against public schools.

It turned out he actually wasn't a cop, but a uniformed guard, one of many citizens who took charge that day — directing traffic, handing out bottled water, crowding aboard flatbed trucks racing downtown to help any way they could.
When I was a kid, Bo Jackson was one of my favorite players, not just because he was an astonishing blend of speed and power, but because I loved his six-shooter touchdown celebration. Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith and his "home run" sack dance are something I'll never forget. The thought of Deion Sanders high-stepping and tap dancing after an interception return still make me smile. The fact that Barry Sanders simply handed the ball to the referee after a score was great too, because it made him unique in his own classy, understated way. But I never once wished that the entire league behaved like Barry Sanders.

TAMPA — Cilantro is the most divisive herb. Some people can't even be in the same room with it, can detect a single quark of the green herb in a bathtub of salsa. Scientists think there is a gene that causes some people to perceive the flavor as unpleasantly "soapy." Like fruitcake or gin, there's no middle ground (see ihatecilantro.com).

Instead, when asked why he had done something that appeared to be in plain violation of the state law banning government resources from being used for political advocacy, Ekard denounced the question as "dangerous" and "silly."

The problem with being Justin Bieber is that eventually you’ve got to grow up. All of those kids who went crazy for "Baby" and "U Smile" in 2010 are two years older and more discerning; eventually, they’ll be down at the college radio station spinning Wild Flag and Beach House, aggressively disowning their preteen folly. How does an artist who specializes in anodyne professions of puppy love stay relevant as his fan base ages along with him? Has the time come for Justin Bieber to get sexy?

Johnson said courses are offered only after detailed research of the local labor market confirms that jobs for such positions will be plentiful for years to come. The program also forms partnerships with prospective employers.

The film, produced and directed by Aksoy, whose directing milieu heretofore had been comedy, tells of how the Ottomans' 21-year-old ruler, Mehmet II, took down the walls of the already beleaguered city and put an end to the flagging Byzantine Empire. It's filled with big battle scenes, the world's largest cannon (forged by a woman, no less) and a cameo voice-over by an actor portraying the Prophet Mohammed.

An occasionally by-the-numbers, often moving documentary about the Youth America Grand Prix, a U.S. ballerina competition, "First Position" stirs memories of the spelling-bee doc "Spellbound." The young subjects compete for scholarships and potential careers, and in several instances, the journey they've traveled is evident in their drive. Their devotion to their art is admirable, and the film gets under the skin, if never really in our blood.

Coby Fleener, tight end, Stanford: While ogling quarterback Andrew Luck, did Elway fall in love with the guy catching those perfect spirals? It would make sense for an old quarterback to develop a man crush on a tight end with big-play capability. It also makes more sense than taking a running back in the first round.
At Sears and Kmart this holiday season, shoppers can put as little as $15 down on retail purchases and pay in full later.

The turn card didn't affect the hand. No draws were completed, and Mr. E still made a big bet that was almost the size of the pot. I picked the worst option here. Since Mr. E kept in check (bad pun, I know) and so had I, it's unlikely he was bluffing. At the time, I thought he was capable of bluffing since he had a lot of chips -- not to mention the tell I thought that I noticed, which ultimately led me to move all in. I could have just called his turn bet, leaving myself with $17,000 in chips. It would have been almost impossible for Mr. E to bluff the river, and I could have saved my tournament life.

"Increasingly, and unfortunately in my view, students have been required to shoulder a greater share of the burden of funding higher education than they have since the advent of public education," Pridemore said.

It must be noted, however, that Lee enjoyed a long honeymoon partly because of his assurances that he had no interest in running for the office.
In the video for the Extra Mile’s “By Your Side,” his two worlds of fatherhood and hip-hop combine. In the black and white clip, Rome pushes his two children — Cydné and Dana, 4 — on swings, as E. Hill’s chopped soul sample plays. It’s a song of inner conflict — What does it mean to be a father? Will my daughters be attracted to men like their dad, for better or worse? — that encapsulates what makes Rome a vital voice in Baltimore’s rap scene.
“Liza’s,” which ran at the Palace Theatre on Broadway in December 2008 and January 2009, was, in part, a tribute to the two women who exerted the greatest influence over Minnelli’s early development as a performer: her famous mother, Judy Garland, and her lesser-known godmother, Kay Thompson.

These turn out to be hard lessons to learn. Obama offered a vision that tied together jobs and taxes, manufacturing and training, education and welfare. Yet Christina D.

The president has doggedly pushed piecemeal proposals that he says will improve the lives of middle-income Americans -- from hiring teachers and firefighters to streamlining the refinancing of home mortgages -- as a way to revive the broader job market in the face of a hostile Congress.

Like "The Lord of the Rings," C.S. Lewis' "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was the product of a Great Britain that had just been through a war of survival. The story neither was about World War II, nor was it an allegory for it, and yet it was informed by the moral absolutes and challenges of the wartime period: There's the presence of darkest evil, which can't be avoided but must be faced head-on. There's the grim understanding that sacrifice is necessary, that whole worlds are riding on the actions of a handful of individuals. And, in the presence of a wickedness so complete as to be supernatural, there's faith in absolute goodness.
The series was supposed to continue at Hayward Field this year as a coed meet, but UO coach Vin Lananna said logistics couldn't be worked out.
