I know you've spent time at LaGuardia in New York, LAX in Los Angeles, O'Hare in Chicago. Hopkins is one of the easiest airports in the country to negotiate. Plus, if you show up late for a flight (and don't have a loaded handgun in your carry-on bag like a certain football player I won't mention, mainly because he's big enough to chew me up and spit out Kibbles & Bits), you're probably still going to make your flight.

By the fall, the deteriorating economy had broadened the thirst for change from a base of Democratic Party regulars and anti-war activists to encompass a majority of the electorate. McCain's only chances for victory slipped away as the success of the surge he championed in Iraq was obscured by the economic collapse here at home. But looking back to the pivotal moments along the primary campaign trail last spring, it's clear that neither candidate could have possibly come this far without challenging their parties' conventional wisdom on a war that -- to most Americans -- barely seems to matter anymore.

I'm reading this morning's Town Talk on Feb. 22. The last article says if you can't play, don't. This is real sportsmanship. I thought this was not a game for just winning. It was to bring out the best in any kid and show them that they can have some self-esteem about other things. And the person who wrote this is probably one of those guys who gets out on the field and yells at the umpires because their son or daughter is not being shown at their potential. Give us a break, everybody. You don't always have to win.

The underlying goal of SB 1070 is "attrition through enforcement" — making undocumented immigrants feel unwelcome in Arizona and making their day-to-day lives so difficult that they move on. Gov. Jan Brewer argues that this can be done without abuse or racial profiling of Latinos. But similar efforts undertaken by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio have produced alarming results. Arpaio used the power of his office to stop Latino drivers disproportionately and to initiate immigration sweeps in neighborhoods not in response to reports of crime but rather to complaints that people with dark skin were present. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that such tactics resulted in "unconstitutional policing" and routinely violated the rights of Latinos, including U.S. citizens and legal residents.

The firing of Hue Jackson? Had it been done in a vacuum, it might have signified little more than the team's continuing drift.

The best parts of the film, for me, came toward the end, when the lives of the four lovers become bittersweet and melancholy. They were so happy for a time. They were inseparable. Now it is all over. There's a flashback where they walk together down to the farm pond to wash off the flour. As they dry contentedly in the sun, Teri still has a little flour behind her ear. You can't do better than that.

David: It's an industry-wide practice to sabotage older users and try to force them to move into newer (more expensive) contracts. When they start out trying to gain market share, they make the offers and promises.

If you don't want to spend the time and money for a full-blown luau, you can sample the show's signature dish -- kalua pork -- at this tiny restaurant. In its flashier version, the slow-roasted pork comes out of an imu, an underground pit stove covered with taro leaves that is the centerpiece of the luau. There's less show at Ono Hawaiian Foods, but the kalua pork is better than at nearly all the luaus I have attended over the years.

With a decision that pushes the gay marriage issue a step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld former San Francisco Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who invalidated Proposition 8 in 2010 after conducting an unprecedented trial.

His firm will spend a total of $300 million on Market Square, as the 1.1 million-square-foot property is now called. An expanded lobby with 17-foot ceilings, six high-speed elevators, a retail area spanning the width of the building, a courtyard and a basketball court are among the improvements, Shorenstein said during a tour of the site.
Walker's opponents insist the remarks undermine the Republican governor's long-held claim that the polarizing law he and the GOP-led Legislature pushed through stripping most public workers of nearly all their collective bargaining rights was meant solely as a budget-balancing measure. They also say the comments signal Walker ultimately means to go after private sector unions by making Wisconsin a right-to-work state, which would allow workers to not pay dues even if they are covered by a union contract.

Let us not go too far. Let us not get overly carried away. The pope may call the LCWR "radical," but that's a bit like the NRA calling a guy with only nine shotguns a liberal. It's a relative scale, to be sure. They are still wildly devout Catholics; their radicalism, in the larger view, is about as extreme as ordering a glass of wine at a NASCAR rally.

A: Radioactive iodine is one of the most significant airborne contaminants released in a nuclear accident because it will accumulate to high levels in the thyroid gland of those who breath it in. Taking potassium iodide floods the thyroid with stable iodine, thus preventing the radioactive form from gathering in the gland. It protects only the thyroid, not other parts of the body, and does nothing to prevent harm from other radioactive elements released in a nuclear accident, such as cesium.

What about Little’s drops early in the season and what's your take on that? “I think the more you get comfortable with what you’re doing the actual skills that you need to perform become smoother, the game slows down and then again, it’s in college and in high school, with all due respect, there’s not a lot of defenses that get up in your face and challenge every move you make as a receiver. You see a lot of zone coverage, you see alto of free access. In pro football, they’re right up on you and I think that takes a little bit of getting use to for a receiver and that may be what you’re talking about. As you get more and more use to what we’re doing, where you’re supposed to be then I think catching the football then becomes a little bit more natural.”

The Pew Environment Group commissioned a task force of 18 scientists to examine the issue of Gulf restoration. In a report published last September, the investigators found that the Deepwater Horizon blowout was just the most visible, recent problem. Chronic overfishing, poorly planned coastal development, and pollution -- according to the researchers' final report -- had already seriously degraded the area's ecological resilience. Consequently, to move toward effective long-term recovery, federal and state managers must apply a holistic approach to restoration across the region. A dedicated funding source and associated management mechanism are needed, though, to facilitate this change.

TRENTON — It took about two minutes from the time Senate President Steve Sweeney certified the passage of the millionaires tax package for Gov. Chris Christie to veto the bills at his desk. "While I have little doubt that the sponsors and supporters of this bill sincerely believe that the state can tax its way out of this financial crisis, I believe that this bill does nothing more than repeat the failed, irresponsible and unsustainable fiscal policies of the past," wrote Christie in his veto statement. "Now is not the time for more of the same. Ultimately, another tax increase will punish the state’s struggling small businesses and set our economy further back from recovery."

"As an active turbo-machinery engineering researcher for more than 45 years, now focusing on wind turbine research and development, I am quite familiar with the multitude of Ohio initiatives to develop wind turbine farms for Lake Erie.

Manufacturing is where a large portion of the jobs should be."

"We were seated in the fifth row at the Staples Center, and all we saw was Artest (swing his elbow). Then you knew Harden was hit really hard, because he went down and he stayed down. But the Lakers never showed a repeat on the JumboTron, probably because they didn't want to incite the crowd. I flew home Sunday night and saw the replays on ESPN and it was worse. It was really scary."

The state where the phonograph record was invented by Thomas Edison has produced a long list of musical giants.

It will live permanently at NJ.com/rockpop and induct a new class annually.
The rebuilding process will be complicated by the NFL's decision to introduce a new rule that moves the ball from the 30- to the 35-yard line on kickoffs.

Neither Obama nor his GOP rivals on Capitol Hill have yet come forward with specific proposals for cutting such benefit programs.

The GOP, in large part, isn't displaying its usual anti-gay election-year demagoguery, and not just in the "pledge." As recently as 1995, a Republican-controlled Congress was holding hearings investigating "homosexual recruitment" and the "promotion" of homosexuality. During the George W. Bush administration, the party used its fervent opposition to marriage for gay and lesbian couples as a get-out-the-vote strategy, encouraging more than a dozen anti-gay state ballot initiatives geared at driving turnout in the 2004 election and engineering repeated efforts to pass an amendment to the Constitution. This year is the first election year in recent history in which anti-gay rhetoric has been significantly muted: No state is facing an anti-gay initiative on the ballot, and marriage has not been a focus of the national conservative agenda.

The evidence suggests otherwise, and the country would do well to consider a new direction. Immigrants, legal or otherwise, act for rational reasons.

To prepare for Illinois' probable plunge into insolvency, read "Freedom to Fail: The Keystone of American Federalism" by Paul E. Peterson and Daniel Nadler in the University of Chicago Law Review. They note that only 25 of the world's 193 nations have federal systems, and in most of the 25 the freedom of the lower tiers of government is more circumscribed by the central government than American state governments are by the federal government. American states' greater freedom - autonomy under America's system of dual sovereignty - from the central government's supervision requires that they be disciplined instead by the market for government bonds, and the real possibility of default.

A: The compact also has to be signed by the eight Great Lakes governors and then the U.S. Congress for it to become federal law. But there's also no guarantee that the U.S. legislature will approve the compact or even someday repeal it. That's a concern of Great Lakes legislators, especially if drought conditions were to worsen in the South and West -- the same area expected to gain congressional seats after the next U.S. Census. Still, legal experts say that the Congress has not stood in the way of hundreds of other interstate agreements in the last 50 years.

Emilio was clearly proud that the months he'd spent studying the forest and planning the trails had paid off. He masked it with an easy insouciance, poking fun at the paucity of my own bird-watching experience. "What, you've never seen the spot-billed toucanet?" he asked in mock horror, referring to one of Misiones's rarer toucans. A smirk played on his lips as he ushered me 200 feet further into the forest and pointed between a cluster of grapia and tropical cedar trees. "Well, there it is!"

Since getting aligned with agent Eugene Parker of Maximum Sports, Jeffery has worked on his diet and eating smarter. It’s paid off. Now, he just has to come in and perform. The Bears have had wide receivers learn all of their positions at one time in the past. It’s what delayed Earl Bennett as a rookie.

Splitting the series seems reasonable -- that is, if the Cardinals plan on making the final few weeks of the season interesting. It's hard to imagine the Cardinals will gain ground on the Braves this weekend. (They missed that chance this week by failing to sweep in Pittsburgh.) But if they split with the Phillies they can keep pace with Atlanta. Win or lose, the Braves benefit every day that drops off the calendar because that's another day the two teams don't have to play. It's possible to look at the pitching matchups through pinched eyes and upside down and see a few edges for the Cardinals. The pivot could be Sunday night when Chris Carpenter pitches opposite Cole Hamels. That could be the game that decides if the Cardinals split the series or return home without a race to alive.

"Some countries under severe market pressure have no choice but to move faster," she said. "On the whole, however, adjustment should be gradual and steady."

The decision to end "Desperate Housewives" was more difficult than most because over the years it had faltered creatively, then rebounded, only to falter again.

It might be tempting to characterize "Che" as a rebuttal to the more conventional storytelling and humanist exuberance of 2004's "The Motorcycle Diaries," from director Walter Salles. But they're not at odds. Soderbergh has expressed his admiration for that film, and Del Toro effortlessly suggests Guevara's formative adventures as a bourgeois rebel. The political realities of his legacy can be endlessly debated, but in this flawed work of austere beauty, the logistics of war and the language of revolution give way to something greater, a struggle that may be defined by politics but can't be contained by it.

Yet the mental and social effects of both the betrayals and the hearings' aftermath aren't explored in depth, while precious time is eaten up by an overlong party.

Tressels 10-year reign as coach of the Buckeyes ended in disgrace as he was forced to step down for breaking NCAA rules.

All products that make health-related claims need some kind of clearance by the FDA. Cosmetics don't – unless they claim to treat specific problems such as dandruff or acne.

"We don't deviate away from them, the way we used to, where we'd get down a goal or two and we'd get 'individual.' We'd try to do things on our own.

When he gets to the M page and finds out it's "M is for Mouse," Moose goes ballistic and rampages through the rest of the book, stomping on the pie on the P page and overturning the queen on the Q page. Finally, Zebra takes pity on him and invites Moose to share his page, as "Z is for Zebra's friend, Moose." There's lots to look at and laugh over in Zelinsky's comic illustrations - including a gag on the cover: Lift the jacket and you'll see the "normal" cover with "Z is for Zebra" before Moose butted in with his own sign. This is hooves down the most fun alphabet book in years.
Seau's greatest game may have been in the 17-13 victory at Pittsburgh in the AFC championship game in January 1995 that sent the Chargers to the Super Bowl.

As often happens in these family fights, small ideological or tactical differences take on outsized emotional impact, and whatever happens today, the Democratic Party probably will need some time to heal.

The health care proposal seemed particularly unfair to some, because it would require all to pay the same percentage of salary, no matter what kinds of benefits they received or the size of their family.
I think Dave is incapable of stopping himself from following ideas that interest him. He doesn't have a brand he's worried about; he's not worried about a message; he's not interested in trying to create something that's going to be a blockbuster. Failure is an option, but only when you've done something that says, "This is the most honest thing we can put out there." So that allows us to make it as weird as we want because we believe in what we're doing.

Why: Michael Moosbrugger could spend his time working with the profundities of the Gobelsburg estate. But the more low-key Gobelsburger label, from less hallowed fruit, is where his talents truly shine. The 2009 Riesling shows the warm-spice refinement of the Kamptal region, with softer texture and cassia aromas to match lime-blossom flavors. And the tack-sharp 2010 Gruner Veltliner is one to stock away once you find it on shelves. (Importer: A Terry Theise Selection/Michael Skurnik Wines)

My son falls somewhere in the middle: Ezra is verbal, but, at 15, he still tends to talk about the same things over and over: otters, Pixar movies, dog breeds.

“I really believe that film is an art form, and hopefully if the art is good enough, you’ll want to see it more than once,” he says. “That’s what drew me to Scorsese more than anything — I’d seen his other films so many times, and each time discovered a moment I hadn’t picked up on before. That sort of complexity, that amount of detail — well, I think that’s part of what creates good movies. And those are the kind of movies I want to make.

A baby is diagnosed as dying from SIDS if — after a complete review of the medical history, an autopsy and examination of the death scene — no other cause of death can be found. Studies have found that the risk of SIDS increases anywhere from two to tenfold when parents bed-share, depending on the bed-sharing situation and the age of the baby. We don't know exactly why that is, but we do know that babies who die of SIDS often have brainstem deficits associated with their ability to regulate their breathing and heart rate, specifically when faced with reduced carbon dioxide and elevated temperatures. In a bed-sharing environment, given that the baby is sleeping with other bodies and potentially with blankets, we can hypothesize that SIDS would be consistent with these potential environmental stresses.
