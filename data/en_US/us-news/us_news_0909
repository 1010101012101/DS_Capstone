Advertisers immediately bailed, leaving the Browns no choice but to cover every sign in the stadium with black paint. The Browns lost six consecutive games after the move was announced but won their finale at home against the Bengals. It was a surreal moment as the game clock struck zero with no guarantee that the city would ever see another NFL game. Fans cried while using saws and hammers to hack away their seats and any other items they could find as keepsakes.
The House-Senate panel has been working into the evening over the past two weeks to resolve differences between the two bills.

A 2005 study by the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., found that teens drive an average of 1.3 mph faster than all drivers as a whole. In turn, IIHS reported that speeding factored into roughly one-third of all fatal crashes in 2005 when teenagers were behind the wheel — some 50 percent more than it did in fatal crashes for 20- to 49-year-olds.
Prior's lover Louis (Aaron Paul Gotzon) has left him, a terrible betrayal, and has embarked on an affair with a guilt-stricken Mormon lawyer, Joe (Stephen Peirick), whom Cohn mentored. Joe's wife Harper (Rachel Hanks), also forsaken, abandons herself to Valium and fantasy.

Grantham also said that inactive voters may go to the polls and cast a ballot just like active voters, so the existing system does not prevent anyone from voting.
Easier. And cheaper.
It also means Marillac also avoids the mountains of paperwork, required by Medicaid and federal subsidies. That is the secret to its success, said Dr. Steve Hurd, executive director. That ominous paperwork "would impair our ability to deliver services" because it would force doctors to pigeonhole each patient into a Medicaid procedure code.
Don and Phil Everly recorded some of the biggest hits of the early rock era -- "Bye Bye Love," "Wake Up Little Susie," "All I Have to Do is Dream," "When Will I Be Loved," "Cathy's Clown" and more. But their lasting contribution to the music lies in their seamless vocal harmonies, a style they developed by marrying the country sound of sibling vocal groups such as The Stanley Brothers and The Louvin Brothers with the exciting new R&B styles of Bo Diddley, Ray Charles and Little Richard.
So far, the Lakota Logging Project has trained about 15 Native Americans, including Shark, with plans to train many more. It marks the largest-scale project to date involving a nonprofit group aiming to help combat the beetle epidemic, said Adam Gahagan, senior forester with Custer State Park.

Sounds Like a Plan (Gamewright, $20; 4-8 players; age 10+; 30 min.) The basic structure of this pleasingly casual game is similar to Apples to Apples, though with a slightly more touchy-feely bent. One player reads a goal off of a "To-Do List" ("Make my mother proud," say, or "Sleep in a castle"); the others each offer the most helpful piece of advice ("Find a good recipe" or "Watch out for the police") available in their hand of cards. As an added wrinkle, the winner may not be the one who offers the best advice, but the worst or the most grandmotherly. I haven't tested this theory, but I imagine this game would be useful for sublimating family tensions over the holidays.
Totino is confident that he and partner Rob Vadas can find construction money, even though developers in Cleveland and across the country are strapped and struggling. Proximity to CSU and the university's 6,000-strong graduate-student population gives the campus project an edge, Totino said. Polaris is considering financing a deal through the Federal Housing Administration and private lenders.

"What we have here is a state agency continuing to thumb its nose at taxpayers," Whitmer said. "Judge Coleman made it clear the public’s right to know is paramount, and The Star-Ledger is simply trying to answer one question: Are taxpayers getting a fair shake or is the authority using our money to unnecessarily subsidize these deals?"

“We just haven’t swung the bats well in the last four games.”
It wasn't strange to see point guard Ty Lawson with 25 points and seven assists. It was much more suspect to see the Nuggets actually outrebound the Lakers, 52-48, outscore them in the paint, 60-52, and beat them in second-chance points, 26-19.
In 2008, Bryan pleaded guilty to neglect and was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. Fritts was found guilty of neglect in 2010 and was sentenced to two years of probation. She was also told to provide community service or pay a $900 fine.

My vegetarian companion was equally surprised by the mushroom paella ($21.95), which had little resemblance to the Spanish specialty. The plate consisted of a heap of thyme- and cumin-spiced rice topped with seitan sausage, sauteed root vegetables, artichokes and kale with a saffron tomato broth and toasted almond gremolata. It, too, possessed an overwhelming one-dimensional spiciness, homogenizing everything else. Why have all those great ingredients if you can't taste them?

The study does not predict savings if such a sharing program is implemented, but Yost estimated it would be "six-figures" over a two-year budget cycle. There would also be millions of dollars in one-time savings from the sale of equipment no longer considered necessary, he said.
So Steve and I divvied up calls to Hickey, his fellow board members, state and national firefighter and fire chief associations and began trolling databases for information on fire department spending across the state. A true, apples-to-apples comparison eluded us as we raced to deadline Tuesday night, but it appeared Hickey’s claims that the district’s salaries—pumped up by overtime—were higher than almost anywhere else, and that the district overall spends more than seemingly comparable districts.

Just as these stories were coming to their conclusions, a white man stoned to death a black boy who had gone swimming off the whites-only 29th Street beach. News of the murder rocketed through nearby neighborhoods, already racially divided. By nightfall, the area had been turned into a racial battleground, as whites rampaged along the borders of the Black Belt, assaulting any African-American they could find. The following day, the violence spread into the Black Belt and over to the stockyards, where there were plenty of African-American workers to victimize. The day after that, with the death toll at 19, the rioting moved into the Loop.
After pop powerhouse Whitney Houston's death last month, an "Idol" tribute night in honor of the Newark native was always on the horizon. When Houston was alive, "Idol" performers spent nearly a decade trying to match the diva's vocal prowess, choosing to sing her biggest hits and usually falling short. Often they would be fed the ever-popular "the song was too big for you" line by the judges. And the judges were right.

It isn't that Obama has anything to do with either Edwards or Parmley, but he risks being dragged into the fray. You don't want to be in the same camera frame or news cycle with the least attractive members of your party.

I was struck by how American entertainment was such a tangible part of ordinary life. In Hong Kong, I ran into a waiter who saves to buy his favorite mainstream Hollywood hits on DVD. Outside a theater in the city, giggly teenagers were camped out as part of"The Hunger Games"mania. And my Great Wall tour guide said he idolizes Brad Pitt in "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" and is on his 80th episode of"Desperate Housewives"— just, he assured me, to work on his English skills.

I guess this all proves two points:
It's the No. 1 (Oregon) vs. No. 7 (Auburn) scoring offenses in the nation, averaging a combined 92 points per game. There's little debate that these two undefeated teams deserve their spots, with No. 3 TCU (12-0) making the only potential argument. The 12-0 Ducks opened as a 3-point favorite over 13-0 Auburn after both teams won Saturday, but the line quickly dropped to a 1-point edge for Oregon.
Among the legion of social-media fanatics, there has been fevered chatter of a political struggle inside the towering walls of the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in downtown Beijing.

Walking away from the federal commitment to Medicaid doesn't solve the problem; it just passes health care costs down to states. Because almost every state, including Maryland, is required by law to balance its budget every year, it means cuts in services and more financial strains for already suffering families, cuts in provider payments, lost jobs in the health care sector, and dampened business activity as the consequences of lost jobs and unmet health care needs ripple through the economy.
Hurricane Irene could dump between 5 and 10 inches of rain statewide, according to the National Weather Service.

The grim ledger yesterday included a blocked field-goal attempt that probably wouldn’t have cleared the snapper’s butt, a kickoff that wasn’t fielded until someone decided to dive on it at the 7, and a roughing penalty on Antrel Rolle that turned a fourth-and-2 into a first-and-10 on the way to Washington’s clinching score.

But are these isolated examples, or are the Cardinals alone in their lack of a self-selected first-round pick? Focusing on a single team can make a critic, a writer, or a fan base too myopic to know if the problems here are really problems everywhere.
Sean Meagher: Former GM Kevin Pritchard called Elliot Williams the second-best athlete in last year's draft, behind John Wall. Blazers scout Chad Buchanan loves his athleticism, versatility and defense. He was good enough to start 12 games as a freshman at Duke. Williams himself thinks, and talks, defense first. If he can fully recover from those knee surgeries and be the athlete he was prior to the injuries, he seems like a solid addition to the second unit.

Where does this end? Could a Catholic caterer refuse to cater a party given by homosexuals or the reception after a civil union?

In all three cases, the vast majority of that currency comes from the U.S. The fate of its economy is linked tightly with the health of its giant neighbor.

In order for an individual to retain an attorney, he or she must have capacity to make the transaction. Generally, the law will presume that adults possess the capacity to undertake any legal task at hand; unless they have been adjudicated otherwise. Capacity is an individual's ability to understand the nature and effect of the act being transacted including the benefits, risks and ability to abide by an agreement. Yet, recognizing when one possesses capacity becomes less evident with age.

Mike Bianchi, Orlando Sentinel: "Urban Meyer quit at Florida a few months ago because he supposedly wanted to spend more time with his family and because he was concerned about his health. Now, not even a year later, it appears he's ready to take the Ohio State job.

Or maybe he was suffering from a rare form of ‘NoTebow-emesis!'"

The Series 9 is super-thin, it's super-light, and it's got a 10-hour battery . . . all in all, it feels like a sneak preview of what a 15-inch MacBook Air might look like.

øThat warming touch comes from the show's take on the relationship between Sherlock and Doctor Watson - played, in two of the best performances you'll find anywhere this season, by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. The limits of the friendship are undefined (Watson constantly bristles that people think they're gay, one of the few times such a running joke avoids growing stale), but what's clear is Sherlock has grown to count on Watson as a friend, and that Watson has begun to see through some of Sherlock's ego-driven bluster.

Ripken: I think that since I retired it's been the fastest 10 years, I think. In baseball, there were moments where it went really fast, normally when you were playing well and you were winning, and those seasons went by really quickly. The longer seasons were when you were losing and you're trying to figure out how to get to the end. When you look back on the streak, in many ways it seems like it was yesterday. It's still fresh in your mind. It's there. But then the realization really hits you when you see the images of your kids and you see a glimpse of that night on TV and you realize how small your kids were and how grown up they are now, and that's the reality that hits you that it is 15 years. In many ways, it doesn't seem like that. It seems like yesterday.

A-: I won't pretend I can evaluate every single pick. First-rounder Riley Reiff is an A-plus choice to me, because of value (he was considered a possible top-10 pick) and need. Receiver Ryan Broyles has to prove he is healthy, and the Lions have more pressing needs. Drafting three corners was wise.

But orchids are the most diverse family of plants on Earth, he said, with more than 25,000 species and 140,000 hybrids.

The candidates will cross paths at a dinner in Iowa this weekend where they will try to court cultural conservatives who haven't yet rallied behind a single contender.

And maybe through suffering and enduring hardships and persevering through that, it strengthens your faith to never give in and to never give up, and to ultimately teach your kids those values. And it's one thing to say it to your kids, but quite another to actually do it, and to stand tall in the face of adversity, because I have to confess there are times when I just want to give up, but then I look into the eyes of my daughters and I look at my little girls, and I think that is not what a father is supposed to do.

At first blush, the Morouns' best argument against the public span is declining border traffic as manufacturing has suffered over the last decade. But the U.S. and Canada must make multibillion-dollar infrastructure investments based on what will be needed 20 or 30 years down the road, and both countries expect traffic to rise in the long term. With construction taking four to five years, the second crossing would not open until 2016 or 2017. The time to start building is now.

The players express their usual skepticism of ownership's books. The Warriors, who are hardly the Lakers or Knicks, sold for $450 million last season.

Color me cynical. After all, we've seen the Magic try to put a positive spin on front-office turmoil in the past. Let's not forget when controversial former general manager John Weisbrod was fired and the Magic tried to paint it like he was leaving to pursue his dream career in hockey. One problem: Weisbrod didn't even have a job in hockey at the time. Seriously, does anybody leave a multimillion-dollar position as an NBA GM for a possible job as an entry-level college hockey scout?

2. Philip Seymour Hoffman taught him his most valuable lesson about acting. The two met on the set of the 2004 Ben Stiller-Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy "Along Came Polly," in which Oka had a small role. "He taught me how to be generous as an actor. Acting can be very solitary even if you're in a scene with someone else because you worry about your own performance and if you look good. Philip told me that generous actors make their partners look good. And at the end of the day that's what acting is about. It's about connecting and sharing the moment."

Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger seemed agitated by a comment made by coach Mike Tomlin. When asked if Roethlisberger can beat the Ravens throwing 50 times, as he did against the Patriots last week, Tomlin replied no because "you're going to get sacked, fumbled and intercepted." To which Roethlisberger responded, "That's not a lot of confidence from your head coach, I guess."

What has emerged is a much less splashy version of the parent trigger, but one more likely to bring about real parent empowerment and meaningful reform. Instead of choosing the schools for a possible parent trigger and engineering the petitions, Parent Revolution now leaves it up to parents to determine whether they want to initiate major reforms and what kind. It will provide information and support to parent groups that ask for it, says Executive Director Ben Austin, but it's up to the parents themselves to set their agenda, organize other parents into a committed nonprofit group and gather signatures.

These laws also have the potential of violating the rights of innocent American citizens and legal residents, making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound. And as other states and localities go their own ways, we face the prospect that different rules for immigration will apply in different parts of the country -� a patchwork of local immigration rules where we all know one clear national standard is needed.

Look no further than the "counter menu," which for $49 takes you through at least five courses of what amounts to a highfalutin reconsideration of bar snacks.

I found support through the neighborhood, and my undergraduate degree is in childhood development.
Few restaurants capture the charm of Carmel like this little sister of Casanova, a restaurant that's been a destination in the area for years.

Payday loans don't -- at least not unless they slide into collections, and that could take longer than a year.
The Cardinals' rush chairman lobbied another former Astro to come give the 'Birds a chance. The recruitment never went beyond their conversations, Berkman said, and he never took the idea to Cardinals management because Pettitte wanted to keep his return quiet and wanted to work something out with the Yankees. That didn't stop Berkman from at least asking the lefty to keep the Cardinals in mind -- even as recently as earlier this month.

Just because your drug of choice is a man (or gambling or risky sex or compulsive shopping or overeating or dieting/exercising or ... ) instead of a mind-altering chemical, that doesn't make your position harmless, and it certainly doesn't make it romantic. It's bad for you. You don't care. Why?
