A ruby-crowned tanager hopped into view, followed by a trio of blue manakins, the males' scarlet caps bold against their turquoise bodies.

At the start of each offseason, the Bill James Handbook drops, and near the back each year is something called "The Favorite Toy". What the Toy does is predict a player's chances of reaching a historic milestone based on age and the career curve of his production. James calculates the chances of players reaching 1,000 career stolen bases (Carl Crawford, 6 percent), 4,000 hits (Jeter, 3 percent), 2,000 RBIs (Rodriguez, 96 percent) and, yes, 900 home runs (Pujols, 2 percent as the only player listed). Basically, the Toy relies on a player's average season and a rate of diminishing production based on age.

You get the idea. I'm a dog person. So it will come as no surprise that I am an ardent proponent of animal blessings. I don't feel as strongly about other pets as I do about dogs, but I am keenly aware that many people do love their pets every bit much as I love mine, even when that pet is not a dog.

When it's something creeping or scaly or reptilic I'm hard-pressed to say I "get it," but I respect the person's choice. Perhaps there's something noble about lavishing care and affection on a tarantula. Who am I to judge?

Other winners are the plantains -- spiced, sweetened and fried to starchy goodness, and Pepian -- chicken in a mild pumpkin mole-style sauce. Wash it down with a Guatemalan or Salvadoran beer or Mexican soda.

Allison joked that, the night before, her partner asked: "What do you think you are doing? Going off in a van with a bunch of queers for two weeks. This is a Not Dead Yet tour, isn't it?" After much applause and a pregnant pause: "Uh huh." But the room was full of reverence for Allison, whom Sister Spit co-founder Michelle Tea introduced as "our hero," and her joining the outfit emblematic of the growing impact Tea's Radar Productions - the nonprofit umbrella to Sister Spit - has had on nurturing and expanding a group of likeminded but otherwise outsider voices. Sister Spit will be on the road through April. Find them at www.radarproductions.org.

I ordered the sirloin steak ($24.95) medium rare. The irregular cut was beyond well done on the thin side and medium well on the thick side. Two lamb chops ($19.95), ordered medium, were devoid of any pink. Both the meat items were unseasoned and lacked the caramelized crust that makes a steak special.
Joel Salatin is a farmer with a message for the masses: You, too, can earn a living off the land without selling out. Pastured poultry, he says, yields greater profits and less pollution than standard methods. For Salatin, farming is above all a spiritual calling, and his charisma and evangelical zeal have turned him into something of a celebrity-prophet for the sustainable agriculture movement.
Can he do the same for Harbor City, or the very different demographics of Harbor Gateway and Wilmington, and the seemingly worlds-away region of Watts?

It is that same arrogance of power which the former Senator from Arkansas, J. William Fulbright, saw shrouded in the deceit which carried us into the abyss of the war in Vietnam.

Joni James: There is one dynamic in a three-way race that no one can predict in post-Obama Florida. The ballot would have a Hispanic (Cuban-American) Republican, a black Democrat and a white independent.

But the most important reason these gambling cafes need to be shut down is gambling brings costs to society and taxpayers. According to a recent exposé in BusinessWeek, most Internet gambling cafe patrons are elderly and poor. Many of the locations even dispense welfare cash. Crime and addiction are the inevitable consequences of predatory gambling. Because of the convenient access to highly addictive gambling they provide, these establishments make millions preying on those who can least afford it. That means more people addicted to gambling, more dependency on taxpayer funded support programs, and more crime committed to support gambling addictions.

A bit more subtle but nonetheless signature Sputnik is the Standard 18 Arm Sputnik Lamp, $329.99, from Inmod. The half chrome candelabra base bulbs (for an additional $55) featured at the end of each arm further flatter the light's unadorned, svelte shape. The simplicity of this particular chrome-plated light would suit a married-in-pop room or add a peek of retro-chic to a contemporary space. Without bulbs, it measures 24 inches wide and is 15 inches long.

This is complex territory, emotionally and theatrically, yet this production stays remarkably surefooted at every step. There’s plenty of spot-on physical humor (Isaac Lamb and Tim True moving in lock-step as a pair of self-loathing “insecurity guards,” John Steinkamp’s tap-dance solo amid a music-hall style welcoming ceremony) and zany miscellany (Val Stevens playing accordion while dressed in a hot-dog suit). And heaping helpings of credit should go to Sam Kusnetz, whose musical compositions, sound design and video projections create the greater part of the first act’s fanciful world.

Each year, Lake Charles, La., sponsors a Rouge et Blanc festival, featuring fine wines and the best food from restaurants and food outlets in the city. All of the booths tend to be popular, but the year I attended, the line waiting to sample Shively and Gene Lampson's fare was the longest of them all, no doubt because the Lampsons were serving a deeply chocolate, richly delicious tart - one of the best desserts ever.

When do jihadists apologize for mass murder or religious persecution? Two years ago in Rasht, Iran, Youcef Nadarkhani, a Christian pastor who converted from Islam, was arrested on charges of apostasy. He has been sentenced to hang for his religious conversion.

"Yankee" may well have begun life as a slur that English colonists hurled at Dutch freebooters in early New York. The Dutch love of cheese was well known, so the English fashioned Yankee from the Dutch "Jan Kass," which literally meant "John Cheese," combining the Dutch first name "Jan" (pronounced "Yahn") with "Kaas," the Dutch word for "cheese," the country's national product.

Getting the economy moving again needs the pump primed. You can't get the pump flowing again with air, a certificate of appreciation and tightfistedness.

Finally Cathi and Bill head off, leaving just Liz and Marie on the beach toiling to make their umbrellas stay up in the sand and wind. The poor girls have been in the sun for close to three hours and they are really at wit's end. All is not lost, however, because somehow Ernie and Cindy have gotten lost at sea and are unable to find the location of the Roadblock. At some point Ernie realizes his navigational error and corrects course. On the beach, Liz and Marie are quickly unraveling and start yelling, "Shut up!" at each other as they continue their struggle until, at last, the tears have dried and they complete the challenge.

"Political thriller" hardly hints at the scope of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature -- in German with excellent English subtitles -- but you've got to start somewhere. (The filmmaker seems to have started at the top of his profession; his film, nominated for an Oscar, is as good as contemporary cinema gets.) First and foremost, he has turned a bright light on a dark, squalid domain of the former East Germany -- the Stasi, or secret police, whose declared goal was "to know everything" in that Communist nation of 17 million souls, and whose 100,000 employees, working with as many as 200,000 informants, sustained a reign of pervasive terror from 1950 until 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. Rather than dwell on the darkness and squalor, however, he has fashioned a genuinely thrilling tale, leavened with sly humor, that works ingenious variations on the theme of cat and mouse, speaks to current concerns about personal privacy and illuminates the timeless conflict between totalitarianism and art.

øFumes coming out of mystic caves figure in big ways in ancient Greek mythology, such as the classical Oracle of Delphi who foretold the future of kings and empires. Although that was thousands of years ago, around 1400 B.C., after the closure of Alepotrypa Cave, such a relationship was suggested by the Greek archaeologist George Papathanassopoulos, who led excavations at the site starting in the 1970's. He speculated that the ancient Greek notion of Hades, a gloomy and misty home for the dead, may have had its origins in the cave's rituals.

There's just too many things day to day you need to be a part of. And to be in the know with your own roster. At some point, you've got to trust the people that you work with. Certainly they narrow down who I need to do my film work on."

Hartel will mark his eleventh year at Guitar Bar in August - "the longest job I've ever had in my life, by far," he notes - and reports that business remains surprisingly strong.

These aren't people who really ever want to start playing publicly or want to get super awesome, it just enriches the listening experience for them by getting to understand music a little better.
