Ocampo was initially charged with the serial killings of the four transients that began on Dec. 20 in Yorba Linda. But after his arrest, detectives with the Orange County homeless serial killer task force expanded an earlier investigation into the October stabbing deaths of Raquel Estrada, 53, and her oldest son Juan Herrera, 35, in their Yorba Linda home – two slayings that were originally blamed on Estrada's youngest son, Eder Herrera, 24, who was a friend of Ocampo's.

For those who remain unmoved by the injustice, the shame and the stain of a rogue band of white police officers who from 1972 to 1991 suffocated, beat and electro-shocked black male suspects to "persuade" them to confess - a fact no longer debated - there is another reason to care.

stop. They have an excellent short-rib beef taco and a very good fish taco. A side order of french (Mexican?) fries delivered some of the best crispy spuds I've ever eaten, served with a tasty chipotle ketchup. I think $10 for a four-taco platter - plus "fiesta corn salad" - is a solid deal, and you can get two- and three-taco platters. Downer: They serve sweet potato tacos, and I hate sweet potatoes. But that's my problem, not theirs.

Goffard's piece on Karl Markvart and the other sailor-dreamers is just one very fine art of storytelling and slice of life -- exquisitely written. He captured something indefinable, fragments of life itself! I just wish it had been longer. The poignancy, humor, the conversation between two tough old men (dueling monologues), the interview with the boatyard manager -- everything right on. Congratulations.
The Magic will head home thinking about what might have been. They could be tied 1-1, and with the next three games scheduled in front of their frenzied fans, they could have denied Bryant and the Lakers their first title since 2002.

It was hard to get my mind off the cofferdam walls, rising high above our heads to hold back, well, more water with more force than I had the nerve to imagine. I noticed there were escape ladders built into those walls. A guy from the corps noticed me notice. He leaned toward my ear and whispered, "We'd never make it."

øThe S&P 500 index currently yields 2.16%, almost the same as the 10-year Treasury note yield.

His predecessor, manager Tony La Russa, would often rail against the Moneyball approach. He warned the cold cut of stats was no substitute for warm-blooded instinct. And, yet, La Russa had his sabermetric moments. He would pay attention to splits when filling out his lineup, and he would warn against small sample sizes. He batted the pitcher eighth partially because he believed in something that metrics could help him verify. Heck, his management of the bullpen could inspire a whole lecture series based on splits, abuse points, and sabermetrics. Duncan's use of information to make informed decisions about future approaches had obvious elements of today's statistical analysis.

The strongest such outburst came Friday. "Let's pray for God to rescue us from these two demons," Mr. Karzai said, apparently holding back tears at a meeting with relatives of the massacre victims, and clearly referring to the United States and the Taliban in the same breath. "There are two demons in our country now." ... The White House went to lengths last week to depict Mr. Karzai's call for Americans to hand over control a year earlier, by 2013, as no change in policy -- only to have Mr. Karzai pointedly insist the next day that it was. The Americans fret that Mr. Karzai is making a difficult job almost impossible, with demands they often see as unreasonable; Mr. Karzai worries that the Americans seek to undermine him, and may yet abandon his country and him, once again, to their fate.With all of this going on, you might think it would be difficult to find someone who believes the U.S. should stick to its mission.

The NFL fosters parity. There's a salary cap that ensures it. There's revenue sharing. I know Kelly is known as an innovator, but he's potentially leaving a place where he held significant advantages over his competition for a league that nullifies them as a hobby.
I’d say yes to all of the above. So, while we should demand restraint and professionalism from these kinds of men when they are carrying out official duties for our country, we should not be shocked if, occasionally, they fail. We did not hire them to do flower arranging or assist in the kindergarten classroom (or to draw cartoons, for heaven’s sake). We hired them to use a gun and take a bullet whenever necessary.

I do not agree with everything that every elected official does, but I prefer to believe that they were making decisions based on what they thought was the right thing to do. Unlike the letter by Lionel Emde in the March 21 Tribune, I do not believe that all our politicians are being dishonest. I have known caring people who have made decisions I personally questioned, but they obviously believed they were right. Again, the truth is that no two human beings will agree on everything!

Here, you are just an hour or so north of the high-end zip codes of Washington, D.C.; Manhattan is barely 200 miles in the other direction. Sometimes, though, it feels as if the only commonality between these places and Baltimore is the occasional Acela train whizzing through.
Pearce says the ceilings had been lowered when air-conditioning was added to the bungalow. He replaced all that ductwork and raised the ceilings to 9 feet, making the 1,000-square-foot home feel roomier.
"Any guy I've ever dated, there would always be that doubt: ‘He didn't answer his phone. What's he doing? It's late.' I'm not the crazy-girlfriend type, but there was a little voice in the back of my head," Underwood, 29, says. "I don't have to worry about Mike. I don't think twice. He's going out?

1. Begin your tour of the region's vast Underground Railroad history in Cincinnati, home of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, an impressive facility on the banks of the Ohio River, which marked the line between freedom and captivity for thousands in the 19th century. The museum has dozens of special events scheduled for this month, but the real reasons to visit are the two floors of permanent exhibits -- a sometimes depressing, sometimes inspiring reflection of the past, present and future. For more information, go to www.freedomcenter.org.

County police Lt. Col. Ken Cox said the department tells officers to break out rifles if there is reason to expect an encounter with an armed suspect. "We don't want them to think, 'Well, it might be a handgun, so I'll just go in with a handgun,'" Cox said. "No, you want to go in with the weapon that's going to give you the best edge.

Where to start? Small. It's easy to get carried away with this menu. The way Centeno endlessly invents, I'm wondering if he's somehow related to Pierre Gagnaire, the three-star French chef who spins dishes out the ends of his fingers. Though their styles couldn't be more different, every time I go to Bäco, I find a handful of fresh dishes that I can't leave without trying.
Unless the Browns drastically changed their mind over the final three games, they'll let Hillis walk in free agency. The Browns don't feel he is worth all the drama. Yes, he looked great against Arizona (99 yards) and Baltimore (112 yards) at the end, but the Browns have no intention of paying him the $5 million to $6 million a year he's believed to be seeking. With their offensive line, they feel they can plug in another back who'll be as successful -- at a much lower cost.

And business was grim. During his seven-plus seasons with the Giants, Tucker’s teams posted a 38-73-1 record, which is enough to drive anyone insane, but especially guys who had come from nowhere (Bloomsburg University) to help Fran Tarkenton practically invent the West Coast offense. There, we said it. And yes, Tucker agrees. But we digress.

"There are so many aspects of this story that make this a story that people want to share and want to tell," social media guru Peter Shankman told The Times. "Fifty years ago, you could have shared it, but your reach would have been much smaller. You would have shared it with your friend, or at work, or in a letter to the editor. What's new is everyone having the ability to do that at their fingertips."

Inside the wheelhouse, Bobo frantically tried to steer the Lady Mary. The engines were throttled up but it seemed to Arias as if the boat was somehow stuck and not moving. Outside the wheelhouse, on the upper deck, Frank Reyes clutched the starboard railing with both hands, frozen in fear.
"That New Jersey's correctional system has absorbed this deep and violent gang flood thus far without a catastrophic incident -- especially in an era of severe budgetary stress -- is more a testament to hard work and circumstance, to ingenuity and sheer luck, than to the supposed structural soundness and viability of the system as a whole," reads the report. "Those who manage and staff these institutions go to work every day in what amounts to a defensive holding action against worsening odds, and all too often, as they reach for practical tools to get the job done properly, they find the system lacking."
Santiago's airport was closed, with smashed windows, partly collapsed ceilings and destroyed pedestrian walkways in the passenger terminals. The capital's subway was shut as well, and transportation was further limited because hundreds of buses were stuck behind a damaged bridge.

Republican Sen. Keith Faber, chairman of the Senate committee that had added the ID requirement on Tuesday, said he expected legal challenges factored into the decision to take the provision out of the sweeping reform measure. There was concern among Senate Republicans that a lawsuit would stall the numerous other changes to the election system contained in the bill.
I wouldn't say I am jealous of all the mothers who surround me. I'm exquisitely aware of the sacrifices that go along with motherhood. Bernal is known as a haven of progressive couples, but I've read enough about supposedly egalitarian heterosexual relationships; when the child arrives, the woman does the vast majority of the work. Despite decades of feminism, the belief that women are primarily responsible for domestic life and childrearing has not changed. It's still a challenge for me to clean my own room. I'm terrified that if I had a child, I wouldn't be able to take care of another person and myself.

"They battled and we battled, and unfortunately they got the last run," Collinsville coach Pete Trapp said. "It's a tough conference, and I think you're gonna see a lot of games like that day in and day out. The conference is just really even.

Cook County has handled large cases before, and Burns' rules largely reflect the playbook used during the R. Kelly trial and Brown's Chicken murder trials. In everything from media credentialing to transporting jurors from an off-site parking location, the logistical arrangements have been almost identical.

"Eric is the coolest kid ever," Crawford said, noting that he is into band, sports, and dancing. "Like seriously, if I left the room and let you spend two hours with him, you would be, 'Oh my God, he's the coolest kid ever.' He's a charmer, that's for sure."
The Tigard-Tualatin district reported that a relatively large share of its high school students transferred to other states or countries -- 12 percent of its class of 2010 and 14 percent for 2011.

The turn of events left Clinton to begin her strategic dialogue with her Chinese counterparts today under a cloud of confusion.

I'm not going to let that happen."

Other Democrats said the amendment, expected to come to a vote Tuesday, goes too far by making it difficult for patients to use their own money to purchase coverage for a legal medical procedure, since there could be few if any plans offering the coverage. The amendment does allow insurance companies to set up separate plans with abortion coverage if they're supported solely by private money, but abortion-rights supporters say companies would be unlikely to do so since there would be little market for them, as most potential customers would be shopping with federal dollars.

By the way, a December layover by St. Nick and Co. did not give the town its name. Fort Christmas, which anchored the pioneer settlement, got its name because Army soldiers started building the structure Dec. 25, 1837.

Music was her balm, her comfort and companion in a confusing, chaotic world. She loved all kinds of music from opera to hip-hop. And how she loved to sing! One of my favorite stories from her time at Copper Canyon Academy, an in-patient treatment center, is about how she would sing the girls on her floor to sleep. When she was just a little squirt, she would bang on the piano while her "Uncle Dean" played his sax. She loved to write new songs and embellish old ones. She had a song in her head, on her heart, and coming out of her mouth 24/7.

There were the amber crosses that Charles Austen, Jane's seafaring brother, had given to her and her sister, Cassandra – famous to us Janeites. On the door leading to the staircase, a sign warned that it squeaked, and said Jane liked it that way so she could hide her manuscripts if she heard someone coming.

Chrenkov radiation is radiation (often visible) given off when a particle travels faster than the speed of light in that medium.
