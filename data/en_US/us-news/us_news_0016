"My favorite is Ikea's Abstrakt in high-gloss red. I usually adorn the cabinet door fronts with large towel rings instead of drawer pulls. This way they add that playful, unexpected, kid's room touch, and kids can actually lay their soccer socks out on them, or their freshly washed hand towels," Flynn says. "For a 6-year-old boy in Los Angeles, I installed three of them side-by-side on a wall below a window, instantly adding concealed storage for his sports gear. Plus, it doubles as a homework area, since I added a countertop to it."

After months of talks, negotiators for five major banks, the Obama administration and most state attorneys general are poised to settle claims stemming from a probe of "robo-signing" — the banks' widespread practice of rubber-stamping some of the paperwork involved in a foreclosure. It's a settlement, so by its nature neither side gets everything it wanted out of the deal. But it offers relief now and in the near future for millions of borrowers, and the precedent it sets for loan modifications could help millions more. That's why California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who's been reluctant to sign on, should do so.
"The clear trend towards overlapping regulatory initiatives will continue to challenge the mortgage industry," said Andrew Sandler, co-chairman of BuckleySandler LLP, a law firm that represents banks. "Hopefully the regulators will focus on the need for consistency in what they are putting out."

Some elements of the film that feel like flourishes have at least a grounding in fact. Tiede really did head to a rehearsal of a local musical production after shooting Nugent, although it was "Guys and Dolls" in real life, not "The Music Man," as it is in the movie. That small embellishment in the film provides Black a chance for a charmingly frenetic rendition of "Seventy-Six Trombones."

The weekend is here, as is PIFF, but so is the worst day of the year. Well, the Worst Day of the Year Ride, anyway. And Valentine's Day is getting close, so you may choose to celebrate that this weekend, unless you consider Feb. 14 the worst day of the year. Days are always what you make of them, I guess. Without further ado, here are some ideas for what to make of your weekend, in the form of a lovingly curated list of Portland events.

Instead, she suggests giving Blue Acres a revenue and public-relations boost.
I hate for the church to sound like a Grinch, constantly nagging and scolding and warning everyone not to get into the Christmas spirit until after the last Sunday of Advent is behind us. I'm not against baking cookies or visiting relatives or doing a little extra shopping in December. But we do need to be honest with ourselves and ask if perhaps our expectations of what is supposed to happen in this season might be taking the place of joyfully anticipating the unexpected.

Sullivan said she was a casual Notre Dame fan before a trip to the campus cemented her decision to play there.

Through his first 10⅓ innings this season, Santana (1-1, 4.76 ERA) evoked hope by peppering inefficient appearances with glimmers of past greatness. Tonight was different, a full-out collapse that ended after 55 pitches (35 strikes).

This latest performance elicited more concern, considering his tenuous condition.

This could all change soon. Besides "Damsels in Distress," she'll be co-starring in the upcoming HBO series adapted from Jonathan Franzen's "The Corrections"; and in June, speaking of a young Keaton, she's co-starring in Woody Allen's "To Rome With Love." A Greta Gerwig fan might even worry, the way a fan of a smart, unaffected band would worry about that band going mainstream and playing arenas — success can strip away eccentricity. At the moment, though, certainly no one in this Chicago neighborhood recognizes her.

The system is terrible, economically and socially. Price controls limit supply and favor those who got there first. In 2011, someone moving into an unregulated Manhattan apartment paid an average $3,309, because of tight supply; the vacancy rate was less than 1%.

Mayoral candidates Joseph T. "Jody" Landers, state Sen. Catherine Pugh and Otis Rolley say that a rapid and radical cut to the property tax would spur a significant influx of new residents, which would broaden the tax base, increase property values and offset much of the revenue lost from lowering the rate. They say increased economic activity, rising property values and higher individual income tax receipts would also mitigate the loss. Armed with a report from the city's finance department, the mayor calls this a fantasy — the city's number-crunching suggested that Baltimore would need to attract 217,000 new households to make up for the lost revenue.

(On if the West Coast offense looks he wants it to and where he would want it to go)- "There's room for improvement. I think part of that had to do with the offseason not being able to use it. I think some of the things we do are okay. Are we all a little frustrated by our offense right now? Yeah, I think so, but am I surprised? No, it did take some time to really time this thing out. As I mentioned earlier, because we're young I suspect as the season goes along and every time they get one more game under their belt, one more game under their belt, listen to this, practice this, same plays and all that, that you should see a little bit more of an offense with a little more timing, a little more fluidness to it. You've seen this system work before and it works. It just takes some time to get on the same page. I think we were hurt just a little bit by what happened in the offseason, like a lot of teams. You can see it every once in a while out there."

Palo Alto was the most surprisingly sexed-up burb in the whole mix. It turns out that 1 in 5,000 in Palo Alto are seeking anal. compared to San Francisco, where 1 in 4,000 are looking for backdoor action, Palo Alto may seem paltry for the anal enthusiast and lube salesman alike (in both cases, 27 percent are M4M). But considering that in most Bay Area cities in my survey only 1 in 10,000 are seeking anal, Palo Alto is actually seeking twice as much anal action as the rest of the Bay Area.

Obama's surge will bring to 51,000 his Afghanistan escalation since March. Supposedly this will buy time for Afghan forces to become adequate.

Litigants in the case against the State Center development in Baltimore are decrying a bill that passed the House of Delegates setting out new rules for public-private partnerships in Maryland.

Although three-time Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep - who provides a third or so of the voiceover, contrary to what promotional materials indicate - does her emotive best to make us care about global warming and its impact on the Arctic's flippered and four-legged inhabitants, the script is mildly instructive at best (roughly 20,000 polar bears left on Earth, etc.) and off-puttingly preachy at worst.

Again, this is perhaps the only questions that matters: Do we stay addicted to our patterns and our former selves, or do we harness the difficult opportunities when we see them, when the chance for change swims into view, knowing they won't wait around for long, knowing, deep down, that if we ignore them the energy will stagnate and congeal into fear and fat, misery and fundamentalist Republican Christianity, never to have hot sex again?

Those that say home ownership should be a thing of the past only have dollar signs in their eyes. They make the mistake of thinking the only reason people aspire to be homeowners is the dream of making a killing when they sell their home someday. Or, they want to be able to utilize the equity they build in their homes to finance the luxuries of life. While this attitude by some contributed to our economic challenges, the truth is home ownership was never meant to be a get-rich-quick scheme.

For Romney, a Michigan defeat would be disastrous. Romney was born in Detroit and raised in Bloomfield Hills, an upscale suburb. In 2008, he won the Michigan primary by a comfortable nine-point margin over McCain.

The new report shows that although California women, like their counterparts nationwide, are now more likely to earn college — and graduate — degrees than men, far fewer women get their degrees in engineering, math or computer-related fields.

Of course, life has its compensations. Jake has the NFL career, but Josh got the looks and the brains. He has done some modeling (mostly print work), but that’s not in his long-term future.

What a great place, this secluded little corner with this understated bistro, 1 year old this month, and many months removed from a bumpy start that made me question whether it even stood a chance. Like so many new restaurants, its first few months seemed to portend its own death, the fewer installments the better.

The thought of eating man's best friend is, of course, repulsive to us -- as it is, no doubt, to Obama. As these things go, the dog theme has taken on barking-mad dimensions. A pro-Romney poster features a puppy with the caption: "Romney 2012: I'd rather go for a ride with Mitt than be eaten by Obama." Campaign buttons show a dog like Bo and the caption: "Donate or Barack Will Eat Me."

He's driving along carefully, not going fast. Pretty soon we hear a racket, so we quick pulled off to the side and we all laid down in the woods. And this American truck goes past us, headed to Bastogne, and they sprayed the road with a machine gun as they went. We figured heck, that's a good guy to follow.
"I'm all in right now," he said. "I don't think there's anything that can make me change my decision. I've thought about this really hard, took a lot of time, sat down with my family, talked to them about it so I've made my decision and I'm not going to change it."

One of the more frustrating parts for the Blazers was that they didn't take advantage of a mediocre performance by All-Star Kobe Bryant, who made just 3 of 11 field goals and finished with 12 points.

The Reds got home runs from Ryan Ludwick, Brandon Phillips, and Drew Stubbs as they salvaged one win from their first visit to Busch this season.

2. Fenway Park, Boston: Ive been to Wrigley Field. Ive been to Yankee Stadium. You can have 'em. Nothing compares to Fenway in terms of the close proximity of the stands and the knowledge of the fans. Ignore (if you can) the arrogance of Red Sox fans. And appreciate the fact that they cheer when a hitter grounds out to second to move the runner along from second to third. Wrigley is all about the party in the bleachers (which is fun in its own right). Fenway is pure baseball.

If he is, than that has to be the world's highest radar level. Right now, if you're underestimating Edwin's scoring ability than you either don't care or aren't paying attention. Saturday afternoon, Edwin tallied a career-high 24 points in the win over Providence. Tuesday night, he had 24 points — in the first half. By the end of the night, he had set a new career-high with 28 points and has firmly established himself as a bona fide scorer. The Paterson Catholic product has always been thought of as a slasher, but now he's become a true scoring threat. In the last two games, he is 9-of-13 from 3-point range and is an absolute nightmare on the fast-break. He was really locked down in the second half by DePaul — something which we expect he'll see more of — but to be honest, Edwin's probably eclipsed Herb Pope as the second scoring option for this year. For now, at least.

And for billows of creamy guacamole, tinged with smoked trout and bacon -- and a wide variety of other flavors. Margaritas come in flights here, often with freshly made syrups. And don't miss what chef Eric Williams can do with adobo seasoning on lamb chops or with a nut crust on trout.

And Monday night in Seattle, Fister came off the disabled list and threw seven shutout innings.

But spend a couple hours downtown or visit one of the smaller wineries on Diamond Mountain and see their extraordinary vistas, and you'll conclude that the extra few miles up the highway have kept Calistoga just a little bit apart from the rest of Napa.

Chacin is officially a concern. He has pitched like a fifth starter for months, winning three times in his last 20 starts dating to last season.

However, he needs to string together some solid starts or it could be time to give Tyler Chatwood or Christian Friedrich a shot.
But Mod Lang is hardly an ordinary record store.

On the campaign trail, all the 13 candidates have had to face public exposure, often more focused on the personal than on their economic or social programs.

Tressel wasnt surviving this. There was no way. He blatantly lied to his superiors and NCAA investigators, breaching explicit terms of his contract. But Tressel became leverage for the university with the NCAA. His bosses defiantly stood by him. Forcing out a coach they so staunchly supported just weeks earlier  and who was so successful against the Buckeyes arch enemy  sends another signal to the NCAA that Ohio State is sternly policing itself, purging the program of the root of the compliance problems.

She then ran 11.73 seconds to win the 100 meters at the meet, but crossed the finish line hobbling with a slight hamstring pull. She shut it down for a while, but came on strong at season's end, despite not being 100 percent recovered.

BUFORD, Wyo. (AP) - Buford is a small place for sure, but so is the world.
Attorneys in Cuyahoga County are not assigned as counsel until after indictment and county arraignment. Now that may be quite convenient for the attorney (especially those who benefit at taxpayers' expense from an assignment system to a tune reaching six figures annually), but it's hell on the client sitting in the county jail. And it often means indictments issued that were entirely avoidable.

Sightlines in the stadium and proximity to the field will be a priority. One of the Metrodome's endearing qualities is the noise level that the fans generate, ear-splitting volume that gives the Vikings one of the better home-field advantages in the league.

So, I ask: Do we want our state government -- and thus, by extension, all of us -- to be in the business of taking lives in what amounts to a death lottery?

1. The Colts have a long, long way to go. They’ve gutted the entire organization, from the club president on down through the coaching staff and team leaders like Peyton Manning, Jeff Saturday and Dallas Clark.

A one-way ride costs a quarter, or five rides for a buck. No tourist, however, has ever felt the need to take more than one ride. Angelenos, without any proper cable cars to compare it to, always make a big fuss about the fate of their beloved Angels Flight, which spent three decades in a warehouse while Bunker Hill was being remodeled and another nine years in the fix-it shop after the accident.
We had planned to meet up at his friend's ranch, though this description is, again, fairly loose, there not being any cattle or cowboys in evidence. The term "planned" may also not be entirely accurate as there had been several versions of suggested itineraries and I was a bit vague about which one I had agreed to. I need not have worried, as a completely new version emerged during the first few rounds of complimentary margaritas that evening. We abandoned the hiring of a local Tarahumara Indian guide and pack animals in favor of "traveling light." I remember requesting the rental of a sleeping bag and tent, but this also seemed to be off the agenda.

Yet these laws do little to help poor workers. In January, economists at Charles River Associates prepared a report for the mayor on a similar bill.

A ski resort in the summer offers sights you'd never glimpse while schussing, such as the spectacular vistas from the 11,492-foot Boreas Pass, which closes to traffic from Nov. 1 until spring.

One challenge is how to enforce those principles. The White House wants to put them into law, and that's a good idea — provided that lawmakers resist the urge to require or ban specific technolgies. Until then, the administration plans to work with industry groups and other interested parties on an optional code of conduct that will be legally enforceable. Why any Web company's legal advisers would allow it to agree to such a code is a mystery, especially if there's no guarantee that its competitors or disruptive new entrants will.

I, too, expect this match to be the best of the night from an in-ring standpoint and just hope it will be alloted enough time to truly become something special, a WrestleMania classic for the ages.
