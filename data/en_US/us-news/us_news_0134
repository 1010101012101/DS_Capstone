Q: The calculation our Lansing Bureau did is you can make as much as 60 cents a gallon and not pay the taxes on that. That's pretty lucrative.
"We always reserved the right to go anywhere to get Osama bin Laden, I said that very clearly in the response that I made. Many people believed as I did it was naive on the part of the president, at that time the candidate, to say he would go into Pakistan. It was a very, if you will, fragile and flammable time in Pakistan and I thought it was a mistake of his as a candidate for the presidency of the United States to announce that he would go in," Romney said.

• Dirk Facer, Deseret News: Utes lose 7th straight game against Cal State Fullerton, 81-50: Utah, in fact, looked quite shaky early on in losing its seventh straight game. Playing without scoring and assist leader Josh "Jiggy" Watkins, who was suspended by head coach Larry Krystkowiak earlier in the week for conduct detrimental to the team, the Utes got off to a poor start and never recovered.

A second study in Europe found that colonoscopies did a better job of finding polyps than another common screening tool — tests that look for blood in stool. Both studies were published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
With thoughtful care, Dirda explains how Conan Doyle "rose above the conventions of his time" in many of his writings. Dirda shines a helpful light on the adventurers Professor Challenger and Brigadier Gerard, while a selection of "weird" fiction causes him to declare that those stories "can stand up to the best work of such masters of the uncanny as Sheridan Le Fanu and M.R. James." (As a longtime admirer of James, I was thoroughly piqued by this — and promptly bought a collection of Conan Doyle's ghostly tales to read over the holidays.)
All the while he caught the eye of NBA scouts.

At the time, the institute was just beginning to develop the first myoelectric limbs for adults and kids. Prior to that, many children went without prosthesis or used a mechanical-type arm with a hook on the end or other cumbersome device controlled by a harness worn around the shoulders. Those devices were difficult for young children to master because many are still learning the physical and cognitive abilities required to make them work, said Carl Brenner, the artificial limb developer who has created all three of the arms at his Livonia business that Annabelle has used thus far.

The film shows more promise when it manages to dial down the wackiness, touching on the ways motherhood can fray friendships and force uncomfortable realizations. In one genuinely affecting scene, Kim wonders if holding out on her long-held professional aspiration — in this case, opening a shopping mall for dogs — is impairing her ability to embrace motherhood. Granted, her career goal is ludicrous, but the sense of a childish young woman finally starting to understand what growing up actually looks like is sensitively played.
A family relative identified the woman killed as Ann Jefferson, who according to public records is 62.

The report also recommended such cost-saving actions as reducing the size of the county's pool car fleet; putting liens on personal property if booking fees at the county jail are not paid in six months; and reviewing usage of the third floor of police headquarters which, the report asserted, "is heated and cooled, yet it is rarely used."
Many people may find that troubling. Our age is marked by worries about too much information floating around too freely -- some of us want as little to do with the digital world as possible, and most of us who feel differently still sometimes wish we could keep that world's tentacles at bay. Given that, it's off-putting to imagine that having a Web page could become an expectation and a near-necessity. But technology and the social changes it ushers in have always been coercive. We'll get used to the idea, just as we've gotten used to all the ones that preceded it, and soon enough we'll be able to tell a lot about a person by, say, the mere formatting of their home page -- including if they made it themselves or had the communications company do it for them. Whether we like it or not, it's too late to cram the personal-information genie back into his bottle. Better to make sure he serves us.
"Keeping it 1-0 is always stressful," Tejada added. "We can make a mistake and they have a breakaway and score. Getting that second goal is always a goal to putting a team away."

“I’m still getting used to the daddy thing,” Emmich said. “That’s making it harder to just go away and tour for months at a time like I used to. The gallery show was great, but it was basically just a way to thank the people who donated and congratulate ourselves for getting it done on schedule. It wasn’t so much a record release show as a private thank you party.” Val Emmich & The Veeries have shows scheduled in Philadelphia, D.C., New York City, and Boston over the next six months. “I don’t know what will happen beyond that,” he said. “I wish I knew how to get this record out further. It’s a record that needs to be performed live, so that’s what we’ll do, as much as we can, and hope that it reaches a larger audience.”
Fewer babies were born to teenagers in 2010 than in any year since 1946. If the teen birth rates observed in 1991 had not declined through 2010, there would have been an estimated 3.4 million additional births to teens during 1992–2010.

Pippin has a bizarre finale, beautifully done here, and I'm not about to give it away. I've always been stumped by what the last scene, with its powerful song, tries to tell us. It seems to say that you can't pursue your dreams and at the same time grasp reality. Bummer - and hardly in the spirit of the musical. My wife and I began to talk about the finale's meaning after the show, then realized we'd wondered about it decades ago. That ambiguity may be a flaw in Pippin - but its ability to force us once again into the same line of thought made us chuckle.

About a mile and a half from the end of the Toothaker Trail, the Pedersen Trail bends due south and follows an abandoned road about a mile and a quarter.

In September 2007, the Vought House was listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, having met not just one but all four possible criteria: it contributes to understanding ways of life in colonial New Jersey; it was the home of historically significant people, and the site of important local events. Finally, the house itself is an important artifact, especially the wattle and daub decorative plaster ceilings. No other homes of that period have met all four criteria for inclusion on the New Jersey Register, which makes this house the most significant Revolutionary War site in Hunterdon County.

Jake Clemons did it again. Three songs into the E Street Band’s set at the Izod Center on Wednesday night — the second of two magnificent concerts in front of capacity crowds at the Meadowlands arena — Clarence’s nephew stepped into the spotlight and nailed the saxophone solo to "The Ties That Bind," a song about family, community and our responsibilities to each other. Bruce Springsteen beamed at his new band member and then, overjoyed, threw a roundhouse punch into the air and sprinted back to the center microphone to deliver the final verse, and bring the song home.

If no party can assemble a coalition, the country will need to hold new elections, probably in June.

Pastor said he hasn't given up hope that Congress might take up immigration reform, or at least act on parts of it, this year.

I'm not sure how this worked out at the "pool hall," the inside of which I remember seeing no more than once or twice. There may have been a light bulb hanging over each of the pool tables, or the bar, which was probably more the reason people - almost exclusively men - visited there. I remember once when for whatever reason I was sent to deliver something inside, seeing a number of elderly or unemployed men sitting around talking and aiming at the 'spittoons" on the floor to rid themselves of chewing tobacco juice rather than swallow it. (Not all of the tobacco juice hit the spittoons).

Putnam could not say which contaminated New Jersey properties would be next to land on the national list, but he predicted three to five would be added annually. He said that estimate was based largely on happenstance — the probability of finding new points of serious pollution where the responsible company is not around, and of realizing that problems at known sites are more extensive than had been anticipated.

Just a few weeks ago, it looked like the Miami Dolphins might be in the driver's seat for the No. 1 pick in the draft - and presumably Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. But after losing their first seven, the Dolphins have won three in a row for the first time since 2008 with an improved defense and steady play from quarterback Matt Moore, who led the Dolphins to TDs on their first three possessions against Buffalo. He finished 14 for 20 for 160 yards and three TDs with a passer rating of 133.3.

Finally getting a little airtime on the Golf Channel's fifth day of U.S. Am coverage, Geyer came under a little negative scrutiny. An analyst  either Gary Koch or Roger Maltbie, it's not clear which  said Geyer's ball-striking while warming up wasn't to the level of the more recognizable players left in the field. Geyer's 74.6 scoring average his sophomore season was also cited as a reason Spieth's lopsided victory wasn't a surprise.

When Democrats announced the choice in February 2011, they said selecting the Southern city signaled Obama's intent to fight hard for the conservative-leaning state like he did in 2008. They also highlighted the economic transformation in the state and in Charlotte — from tobacco, textiles and furniture-making to research, energy and banking. Party leaders noted the state's strong political leadership and expressed hope that a Perdue re-election bid would get a boost from the attention that would be lavished on the convention.

Then a funny thing happened: A woman named Susan stormed into my life last year. As fate would have it, we live 4,500 miles apart and must compromise on our meeting places. It seemed natural to meet midway, in San Francisco, if only for a short weekend. Better still: She barely knew the city; perhaps a few of my favorite places could make her a believer. And, love it as I do, it's still just a jumble of concrete unless I can share it with others.
• Paola Boivin, Arizona Republic: Dennis Erickson's ASU football program is healthy: Erickson always has had a great connection with his players, but at times he has needed to run a tighter ship.

If his stint is done here, Erickson leaves with the football program in a healthy state.

has to get some credit for being willing to take on the bombastic, locker room bully that Mark Driscoll has shown himself to be (over, and over, and over again). Naturally, he's hearing some of what I've heard in the past, from commenters eager to defend a Christian celebrity. But one of my favorite comments came from the other side, from a commenter frustrated over what we let our leaders get away with: "In the name of love, should we just keep silent?" I read it and thought I could almost hear the voice behind that question. How long, oh, Lord, how long do we let someone spread their toxins unchecked because they're "successful" as the world defines success? How long do we pretend that they matter more than the people they demean, abuse, manipulate and control? How long do we pretend that it's okay for them to corrupt the gospel, little by little, if they're still bringing in big numbers? Should we speak? Or should we remain silent? I know, some of you are reading this and thinking, "Well, Sharon, in your case, the answer to that question is obvious. You speak. You always speak. Have you ever not spoken?" Yes, I get that. I'm always tilting at some windmill or another. But Mark Driscoll has years and years of this behavior behind him, and the situation calls for more than righteous indignation from an infinitesimal blogger

-The branding/superhero era isn't ending anytime soon. In the last year or two, a drumbeat has slowly started that maybe moviedom's comic-book era was winding down. Look at the critical and even commercial sag of several of last summer's movies, said skeptics. "The Avengers" may be sui generis, but expect a reversal of that trend now. Every studio with a superhero license is, as of Monday morning, doubtless checking into how they can wring more out of it - or, if they have several such licenses, perhaps even rolling several characters into one movie.
"I still feel that intimidation today," Gabeira said. "Not because anyone is being rude. But it’s just super hard to paddle out at Pipeline (in Hawaii) and be surrounded by all of these guys in such a small space. You’re surfing with guys who are out there searching for the wave of their life."

Robbinsville Mayor Dave Fried, who had been running for Assembly in the 14th Legislative District, announced today he will drop out of the race due to health concerns. Sheree McGowan, a Robbinsville councilwoman, plans to take his place on the ballot.
"It's more of a suspension of disbelief," he says, adding that having Snoop rap alongside the image makes it seem all the more real. A high-definition video of Tupac — who died after being shot in 1996 — was likely reflected from a screen below using a sheet of mylar, Sapan says.

The Tigers have called up right-handed reliever Brayan Villarreal to take Wilk's roster spot. Before Monday's game, the Tigers can send down Villarreal and call up a starter. Or they can move Duane Below into the rotation for the first time this season; the left-hander pitched two more scoreless innings Wednesday and hasn't allowed a run in his 12 relief innings this season.

It's well known that the Supreme Court in its 2010 Citizens United decision lifted restrictions on political advertising by unions and corporations, contributing to the orgy of special-interest spending already on view in the 2012 presidential campaign. Less noted was the decision's reaffirmation of the constitutionality of laws requiring disclosure of the identities of political donors.
Convention Chief Executive Steve Kerrigan and Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy and co-chairman of the host committee, met with Democratic fundraisers and lobbyists on Dec. 15 at Washington's posh Jefferson Hotel to lay out the ways corporations and lobbyists could help raise money, according to sources familiar with the briefing.

Asked about the state of his current relationship with Clemens, Pettitte told the jury that he hadn't spoken to his friend "in a long time," but added he still believed they were friends.
Rather than offering voters anything new, Republicans and Democrats seem locked into a belief that with just a few more tactical victories, they can convince the half of the country that disagrees with them to go along with the same agenda they have been rejecting for years. It has always seemed ridiculous to suggest that a meaningful third party could emerge to break the deadlock in Washington. But with the prospect of more pointless showdowns like the one we witnessed this week, it might not seem so fanciful for long.

Because the power from the turbines flows to areas of the greatest need, little goes to where it's produced. That irony was highlighted on Christmas Eve when the lights went out in Waterman and Shabbona due to an ice storm and didn't turn back on again for four days in some places. Meanwhile, the turbines kept cranking power to homes and businesses hundreds of miles away.

Beat the clock: An energy slump results from one of two things: Too many carbs at lunch, which leads to an onslaught of insulin and a subsequent drop in blood sugar, or eating too little at lunch, said Sophie Pachella, nutritionist and founder of EatStrong, a New York-based weight management and nutrition consulting company. To combat this, make sure your meal contains 6 to 8 ounces of lean protein (chicken, fish or tofu), healthy fats (nuts, avocado, olive oil) and complex carbs (whole grains, brown rice). If you still crash, try snacking on some peanut butter on celery or a handful of almonds.

It’s a rehearsal, so there’s no audience at the Multnomah Arts Center auditorium. But still, the hush is expectant. Thunder crashes, and three hooded figures, hunched and terrible, appear suddenly at the back of the hall and scurry crab-like towards the stage, their cloaks aswirl.

The young Advocate and the young Congressman had a good thing going. I never hid, I never ducked, and I was always willing to talk and the paper that provided substantive exposure to its readers while never relinquishing its journalistic responsibilities. There weren’t a lot of puff pieces, just good reporting.
Amid mounting criticism, U.S. officials reignited talks with Beijing over the fate of Mr. Chen, whose about-face on a deal keeping him in China threatened a cascade of diplomatic and political embarrassments. The direct appeal to Congress by an activist under Chinese watch heightened the stakes in one of the most serious U.S.-China showdowns since China seized a downed U.S. reconnaissance plane in 2001.
Desert Botanical Garden opened. As far back as the early 1930s, a small group of passionate local citizens saw the need to conserve the desert, including Swedish botanist Gustaf Starck, who found like-minded residents by posting a sign, "Save the desert," with an arrow pointing to his home. In 1936, they formed the Arizona Cactus and Native Flora Society to sponsor a botanical garden to encourage an understanding, appreciation and promotion of the desert. Gertrude Webster, whose name graces one of the garden's buildings, provided connections and financial support.
And now? Foye will finally play on a playoff team this season, his sixth in the NBA. Roy is retired. Foye said he is sad about that because he had hoped to compete against Roy for years, to settle the Roy-for-Foye debate where it should be settled, on the court:
game that was much more of a blowout than the final score suggests.

The Giants have played their best football the last two weeks, defeating playoff-contending teams in must-win situations. The defense — led by the front four — is flying around, getting after the quarterback as it continues to get healthier. The offense seems to be back on track after a two-week interlude, based on Sunday night’s performance in a 31-14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys.
* What we could be seeing, then, are two teams that are beginning to form different views of their respective positions in their evolution as teams. The Blues are young, rising, and gaining confidence. They know the opportunity is there, and they are ready to snatch it. No matter what happens this spring, the Blues also know the best is yet to come; the future will present opportunities for advancement, and perhaps even a Stanley Cup championship. There's an inherent freshness and excitement that can be converted into energy.

How can you simultaneously reside in Kellogg (Michigan), Midland (Michigan), Follansbee (W.Va.), Myrtle Beach (S.C), Waynesboro (Va), Vallejo (Ca.), Mansfield (OH), Salinas (Ca), and Three Rivers (N.M.)? I also found your Haiti email printed in the paper in Lebanon, (PA). That one claimed you reside in Cornwall.

A month after convincing my friend that kicking, paddling and floating in the water would become as routine as signaling, turning and flicking on windshield wipers on the road, I prepared to fly to New Zealand for a completely natural, won't-even-have-to-think-about-it, 450-mile drive by myself down the North Island from Auckland to Wellington.

To emulate the wunderkinds and computer whizzes now inhabiting baseball executive offices, screenwriters Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin invented a guy named Peter Brand, whom Beane lures away from the Indians. Brand (see note below) is played nicely by Jonah Hill, who dials down his usual oddball affectations to create a memorable character. Miller's "Capote" compadre Philip Seymour Hoffman is also on hand in a nice turn as A's manager Art Howe.

It would have been so refreshing if Kozinski had said, "Yeah, I like to look at a racy pictures sometimes; so what? Mind your own business." But that would be asking too much of a public figure. Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Bill Clinton and basketball announcer Marv Albert have all had to deny that they enjoy their sexuality. One of my favorite comments was made by the comedian Bill Maher. Talking about the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he noted that because the U.S. president is always under stress and should be able to relax sometimes to do a better job, Americans should want their commander in chief to enjoy more oral sex.
Shame, really. Because covered in the grime and dust this race throws up, Boonen looked the part: the cobblestone king.

Alas, Santorum also appears to be squarely in the mainstream among GOP presidential candidates now, offering a fiscal plan that's heavy on tax cuts and defense spending and light on real deficit reduction. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the plans offered by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) and Mitt Romney would stop the federal debt from growing, but the ones offered by Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich would actually make it grow faster than it would under Washington's current policies. Rather than quibbling over nonissues from the past such as votes to raise the debt ceiling and to fund parochial highway projects, the candidates ought to spend more time critiquing one another's fiscal plans for the future.

At a few points, Lula sees and feels the radiant hopefulness that can be the true beauty of Americans. In these moments she feels as if she is floating — until something or someone drags her back down.

Cabaret, a picture of decadence in Berlin during the rise of the Nazis, probably struck few people as being the sort of material that guaranteed a sure-fire hit. But it was. A big one. Chicago, which fell flat in its first Broadway production, came roaring back in a long-running revival  perhaps because theatergoers were ready to accept the show's vaudevillian cynicism about murder, bribery and yellow journalism in old Chicago. And then there was the surrealistic Kiss of the Spider Woman, set in a South American prison.
Nick wants to know how Monroe has broken the colorful news about himself -- being a blutbad and all -- to non-creatures.

But this is a franchise that got to the second round of the playoffs with Tim Tebow, began free agency with $40 million of usable cap space, and even after the Manning deal has the ability to keep shopping.
