Iowa cemented its test-market status in 1976, when a little-known former Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter stunned the political world there -- by finishing second, 9 points behind "Uncommitted." Despite endless complaints that the state isn't terribly representative of America -- it skews white, old and rural, its only real city is the size of Akron and, this year, its economy is fairly robust -- both national parties continue to give Iowans the first say of the campaign. Owners of the state's hotels and television stations are eternally grateful.

(On how well defined the receiving core is)- "Whoever can score touchdowns, we'll get him the ball. I think it's going to be a combination. If you look throughout the West Coast systems, we had the same thing in Philadelphia, where we would like to have the ball distributed all over the place between the tight ends, the backs and the wide receivers. It's an offense that I've been around where we haven't had a guy, we had T.O. (Terrell Owens) an he was the one guy who had way more catches than anybody else. That was one year out of all the years I was in Philadelphia, it was spread around. They can all have 60 catches or however you want to talk about it, but it's not necessary to have one guy catch 100 balls. I don't think that's going to be the case here either."
At the screening I attended, the love scene sent titters through the audience, not because of any unruly passion, but because it is glowingly lit and woodenly performed – like "Cinemax After Dark" soft porn, except PG-13 rated.
Perhaps the insulated culture of firefighters made it hard to resist such practice and even harder to blow the whistle on it. But no firefighter should need a legal opinion to know if paying someone else to work for you is right.

Meanwhile, Obama's green-job revolution and its necessarily coercive regulations are killing, not creating, jobs and slowing, not stimulating, economic growth, according to a report by Bryan Leonard of State Budget Solutions.

We cannot change our children or their feelings, really. We can teach them manners and set house rules that protect the inhabitants (and Mom's eardrums). We can negotiate agreements and stay above the fray. But, perhaps, the best gift we can give our children is a little break from all the lessons we are trying to teach them.

Gilbert’s words are echoed by artists all over Music City. Brad Paisley’s "This Is Country Music" album imagined "country" as the exclusive province of everyman candor. On "Where Country Grows," Ashton Shepherd locates the country in the hearts of those who are upstanding and devout and savor the slow pace of a life well-lived. Even Blake Shelton’s hokey but sincere insistence that "we’ve all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside" is an example of this. Country, once engaged with rural realities, is now a private experience.

To assemble the sandwiches: Preheat the oven to 375°. Season the meat well with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a heavy-bottomed medium skillet over medium-high heat. When very hot, add enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom. When the oil is hot, add the meat and sear 3-4 minutes on one side. Flip over, place in the oven and roast until the meat reaches 128° in the thickest part, 5-8 minutes. Remove from the oven, tent with foil and rest at least 10 minutes, then slice thinly.

Yet there are signs of his good taste throughout. Despite the R rating (and a sexy subplot), nothing ever feels unnecessary or exploitative. There’s only one brief look-at-me camera angle, and even the smaller parts — Marisa Tomei as a suspicious reporter, Jeffrey Wright as an ambitious politician (and yes, I know those descriptions are redundant) — are perfectly cast.

But several ministers indicated that they might be willing to accept a forced default if it puts Athens in a position where it can eventually repay its remaining debt -- including the rescue loans from the eurozone and the IMF. The eurozone has said that Greece's debt is sustainable, if it falls to some 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020. Without a restructuring it would reach close to 200 percent by the end of the year.
Her husband, James, a former world-class high hurdler in college, said the only thing he wanted to know about was "whether (the tumor) was cancerous or not.

That was my biggest concern."

It's not always easy being green on vacation in Hawaii. After all, any tour company can call itself "eco-friendly," especially if it thinks it will lure environmentally minded clients.

To make batter, chop chocolate into uniform pieces to ensure even melting. Place chocolate and butter in a bowl over a pot of simmering water, or a double boiler. Avoid all contact with water, which makes chocolate seize up. Melt the chocolate and butter slowly over low heat, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula until melted and well blended. Set aside and keep warm. In a mixing bowl, use an electric beater to whip together eggs and sugar into stiff peaks. Slowly fold flour into egg-sugar mixture, making sure it's well incorporated.

øIf we avoid the overuse of some of these procedures, we can streamline care, and if we can invest in prevention, we can lower health care costs. And we must do that because we can't continue to spend money like drunken sailors on shore leave and expect to be able to care for people. The problems that existed before health care reform are still there. There are Americans who are dying because they don't have access to health care. That is a national shame that we need to correct. We haven't fixed it. Health care reform doesn't fix it. We need to change the system. I don't think health care reform went nearly far enough. And that's the problem.

No matter what the Cardinals decide to do in hiring a manager, I think it's reasonable to believe that Duncan will be back as the pitching coach in 2012. But a few important points need to be made here:

In some ways, Ford is actually a victim of its own success. This was the company's 11th straight quarterly profit, and it was the first quarter since 2006 that the company paid a more typical tax rate of 32.5 percent compared with the 8 percent it had been paying. Ford decided at the end of last quarter to return some deferred tax credits and other assets to its books because it is solidly profitable. The change cost the company $612 million, Shanks said.

* The plan would encourage people to stop paying their mortgages. One of the most perverse features of the McCain bailout is that the responsible people would suddenly have an incentive to become irresponsible and stop paying their mortgages. There are many American households that are living in homes that are underwater, yet they are keeping their promises and paying their bills. Under McCain's plan, though, they would feel like chumps for doing the right thing.

It’s the first public sculpture placed in Newark and one of the best. It depicts a Civil War hero that the town of Kearny, originally a part of Harrison that became a separate municipality and took Kearny as its name in his honor, has long wanted in its community. When the statue was re-sited after the New Jersey Performing Art Center’s construction, Brown’s sculpture was situated facing west, literally showing his back to Kearny. But Kearny obtained a copy in 1994, for just $25,000, which was set up in front of the post office on Midland Avenue.
Baltimore, my hometown, has a large Greek community. When I was growing up, about once a month my family would eat at one of the many small, family-owned Greek restaurants.

The races themselves are very much ad-hoc affairs. They start later and later every year, and even the one rule -- that every car must have a beer holder -- isn't enforced. The two classes of vehicles compete in an as-time-permits number of heats, culminating in a showdown between the top placers.

One main course is listed as "beef" followed by "couscous, carrot-tomato stew, brown butter" ($22).

I agree that there needs to be some improvement in the board's responsiveness. I offered two possible suggestions. He criticized one ( the parallel school board) for lack of specificity. Space does not allow that specificity. I would be happy to provide. The second suggestion, which Mr. Nellies chose not to comment on, was to elect two members to the board county-wide. This would add a voice on the board that wouldn't focus on politics. Both of these ideas would help responsiveness. What they wouldn't do is interject the vicissitudes of politics into how to teach children to read.

Luhnow believes his defense is accomplished enough that he's a fit for the position.

The Long Wharf's season-closer, May 2-27, is Aaron Posner's stage adaptation of the Chaim Potok novel My Name is Asher Lev, about a young painter being pulled apart by the conflicts of his artistic ideals and his Jewish faith. Director Gordon Edelstein, who last fall celebrated his 10th anniversary as artistic director of the Long Wharf, has been sharing special research projects with the cast so they can assure a respectful version of this much-admired story. Rabbi Herbert Brockman of Congregation Mishkan Israel spoke with the cast last week about Potok and about the Lubavitcher sect of Hasidic Judaism; a representative of one of the local Chabads will visit this week to discuss the same themes. The play's cast (Mark Nelson as "Man," Melissa Miller as "Woman" and Ari Brand as Asher Lev) also spent five hours walking around the New York City Lubavitcher neighborhood of Crown Heights, where the story takes place. "This kind of research," Edelstein says, "gives us a specific background for the social and cultural context of the play. Since Potok himself was rooted in orthodoxy, it is really useful to have hard, fast and accurate knowledge in order to tell this story as best we can."

The Democratic Party experienced its own backlash against the cultural revolution in the 1970s. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election, party leaders and pundits blamed activists outside of the old party structure for the landslide defeat. "The American people made an association between McGovern and gay lib, and welfare rights, and pot smoking and black militants and women's lib ... and everything else that they saw as threatening," the Democrats' convention parliamentarian later concluded. In fact, however, polling shortly before the election showed that it was less voters' perception of McGovern as a cultural radical and more their view of him as weak and indecisive that cost him the election. The flight of the white South to Richard Nixon over racial issues didn't help.

Colic signs can range from mild to severe, but should never be ignored, as several of the conditions can become life-threatening in a short period of time.

Steal. Early in my engineering career I worked at Ford, and I remember huge rooms where the newest vehicles from competitors, like Chevy or Toyota, were torn into pieces and spread over long tables.

That said, Pinterest has benefited from a strategy that initially engaged a kind of youthful visual exuberance, and that meant recruiting designers and artists and photographers when they launched in 2010. Back in those comparatively early days — when a tweet was an ornithological term — the staccato pattern of picture-posting seemed more an offshoot of snap-happy photographers (a practice sometimes called "firehosing") than a new form of visual expression.

The new methodology doesn’t negate that upward trend line. It’s solid growth, but it’s not nearly enough — a conclusion supported again by that glaring 67.4 percentage. A study by the Technical College System of Georgia put the non-completion statistics this way: for every 100 students entering 9th grade in a given year, only 56 will graduate.
Banks' solution is simplistic. He argues that black women should consider marrying outside of their race to add competition to the slender black marriage market. If only it were that simple.

Just telling these women to broaden their options is unlikely to work.

Moore has fertile territory for his claim that the '86 edition was the greatest Tour. On the eve of the race, French President François Mitterand telephoned Hinault and encouraged the national hero to make the country proud with what would have been an unprecedented sixth Tour victory. LeMond, an American racing on a French team in France during the country's showcase event against a national icon, found himself competing in hostile territory for what he thought was rightly his.

Betrayed and bewildered, LeMond fought his way back in the Alps to snatch victory from his teammate and become the first American to win the fabled race.

Some argue that such retaliation will adversely affect diplomatic and economic goals, especially in relations with our chief cyber adversaries, Russia and China. But if the cyberthreat is as serious as the government says, it must respond concretely when it has decent attribution, and Congress must give the administration the authorities it needs to do so. Events of the past decade have shown that, in the absence of concrete retaliation, complaints and vague threats will only embolden our adversaries.

Jay Davidson, a corporate lawyer, is one of the chief proponents of this event. He understandably emphasizes that restaurants, hotels and businesses will benefit greatly from a Baltimore Grand Prix.

The flesh of the shrimp is sweet, with a rich velvety texture, enhanced by the salt and lemon. The servers also bring the deep-fried shrimp heads -- crisp, salty and delicious.

Let's do the right thing and change our system for real.

If the bank were to ramp up its bond purchases aggressively and yet fail to calm markets, the damage to its credibility could be devastating. Central banking is a subtle art that rests largely on the institution's ability to convey an aura of invincibility. Once investors lose confidence in a central bank's power, the credibility of the currency itself is impaired.
Slay's office presents Reed's move as favoritism: Reed has been rewarded by firefighters for his support, and his campaign recently got $5,000 from the union.

Nobody who has seen the passion ooze from Tebow's pores really believes he would be happy leading cheers for Manning during the next three years. This is not the same situation as Aaron Rodgers patiently waiting for Brett Favre to wave goodbye to the Packers.

Beer is still the bubbly drink of choice, but in 2005, 8.5 percent of German households' beverage budgets went to sparkling wine, which explains why author Frank Schoonmaker once called it "a national drink." Sekt really just describes any fizzy wine, and in Germany at least, much sekt is made in tanks from French or Italian grapes and sold cheaply. But diligent vintners now strive to create great sekt (often labeled brut) using Champagne-style methods. Dry Riesling sekt can be dramatically refreshing - highlighting that grape's high-acid nature, with the merest dab of sweetness and a lean, stony texture not often found in Champagne. Spatburgunder (German Pinot Noir) and Scheurebe have made inroads.

To start off, you’re shown a map of the world that makes the game seem a little like “Risk.” For reasons unknown, North America is locked to me, and you have to choose “attacking” a territory off the coast of Africa. Logic would reason that the goal is to have one’s sperm conquer all the territories of the world. This seems ... problematic.

“He’s got those freakish athletic numbers,” Reese said of Robinson, who ran a 4.57-second 40-yard dash. “He hasn’t scratched the surface.

His reasoning goes like this: Grape growers and winemakers eager to capitalize on the movie's view of the two varietals abandoned merlot and began to plant like crazy pinot noir, sometimes putting it where it doesn't perform particularly well. Thus, as the proportion of weak pinot noirs rose on the market, the proportion of strong merlots increased.

One twist in this case is that Kagan has recused herself because she was U.S. solicitor general when the federal government brought the lawsuit against Arizona. That weakens the "liberal" bloc and creates the possibility of a 4-4 tie. In a tie, the lower court ruling halting parts of the law from going into effect stands. But because there is no prevailing side, the ruling does not apply to cases in states outside the 9th Circuit appeals court jurisdiction, such as Alabama.

There is no excuse to stab a helpless infant. There was a social worker in the room to witness the event. It appears to that details about the mental health of the mother may have been left out. The article says she had become "irate" and then stabbed her child. An 8-month-old child should not enrage a mother enough to cause her to stab them. Because the mother was able to sneak a knife into the social services building in the first place it appears that the stabbing was pre-meditated. All of these details are a little confusing and more background of the mother and child should have been included.

The battle royal over the debt ceiling also owes something to his influence. Debt until recently was of no concern to Mr. Norquist. Indeed, as two separate writers for the Cato Review demonstrated last year, Mr. Norquist's efforts have not, to use one of his favorite phrases, "starved the beast" of government. On the contrary, they have bloated it; the beast now suffers from acute gastric pains. Nothing is more delightful for legislators than voting for appropriations without having to vote for concurrent tax increases. The "Norquist moratorium" on taxes, even future ones, has fueled zeal to appropriate; witness the "stimulus package."

We may think that we are a long way from the wretched conditions of our medieval past and even from the Summer of Love, but in New York and many other big cities of today, we could expect a similar recrudescence of parasitic infections. The conditions among the unwashed masses of the Occupy Wall Street protesters are favorable for an outbreak of Third World infections as long as the protesters persist in occupying their instant slums; unsanitary conditions among individuals living closely together in poorly-constructed "houses" create an ideal environment for the maintenance and spread of infectious parasites that can easily jump to the permanent residents of densely-populated big cities.

Josh Cochran, NBADraft.net (via FoxSports.com): "He has outstanding size for a point guard, standing at 6-5 with a 6-7-1/2 wingspan. Morris is very quick with an excellent first step, giving him the ability to drive to the paint and create plays. He plays an aggressive, attacking style utilizing his size and quickness effectively. Morris had the ball in his hands a tremendous amount in John Beilein's offense, and he parlayed that into a Big Ten-leading 6.7 assists per game."
