Unlike Indiana Jones, the quest for relics didn’t run in Preston’s family, but he did have a mentor, Dr. Roland “Mac” McDaniel. At prehistoric sites in Loudoun County, Va., the American University-trained archaeologist taught the greenhorn, whose degree was in education, to differentiate between a natural stone and a stone tool, and how to identify the broken sections of projectile points and the byproducts or flakes driven off the stone core.

Though the Wildcats suffered humbling losses to Utah (1998) and Kansas (2003) in NCAA Tournament West Region finals at the building formerly known as the Pond, they created a much fonder memory there last spring by stunning Duke in the West Region semifinal and nearly knocking off Connecticut in the final.
"It's illegal for them to do it without an environmental impact statement," he said. "And the minute they release a true and proper EIS their proposals will be laughed out of town."
Leg-hold traps have been banned in more than 80 nations and outlawed or restricted in eight states, including California, where voters in 1998 passed a proposition banning leg-hold traps, but allowing padded traps in some situations.
The figures follow a report earlier this month that showed improvement in the labor market may help sustain spending. Employers added 243,000 jobs in January, the most since April, and the unemployment rate dropped to a three-year low of 8.3 percent, according to the Labor Department.

--- Peter Schrager, FOXSports.com: Dont’a Hightower, ILB, Alabama. “Hightower played both inside and outside linebacker at Alabama and was also used at DE in some sub-packages. Ray Lewis isn’t getting any younger and there still isn’t an eventual “replacement” in-house. Hightower may start out as an OLB, then move to MLB. Either way, he’s another great young addition to the D. Jimmy Smith, the pick from a year ago, showed flashes in his rookie season. Baltimore’s loading up for the eventual post-Lewis & Reed Era. Another reason to like Hightower to Baltimore? Ozzie Newsome’s a ‘Bama guy.”
He said that should have brought a better result than the peril those aboard the Christmas flight from Amsterdam to Detroit faced. Delta will insist Washington do a better job.
Zusak's popularity is well-deserved. He writes emotionally engaging stories with understated humor and a bittersweet style that refuses to play by straightforward grammatical rules. His earliest published works share many of the same stylistic hallmarks and themes of belonging and survival. They just center on a different geographic region and cast of characters — namely, the teenage Wolfe brothers, Cameron and Ruben, who, as all the oi's and g'day's seem to indicate, live in Australia.

It could happen that your systolic pressure is too high but your diastolic pressure isn't. That's called isolated systolic hypertension, and it's the most common kind of high blood pressure among older people. Though it used to be considered normal for that age group, doctors now know that treating it can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. But it's important to lower the systolic pressure without also lowering the diastolic pressure too much -- a too-low diastolic pressure can make the risk of strokes and heart attacks go back up.

His sketches of the tradesmen are marvelous and often hilarious: Malik, a self-proclaimed artist who lays the tiles; George Jaradi, a mason who refers to himself, royally, by his first name. The plumber, the electrician, the roofer  each considers himself a maalim, a master, and each has a maestro's temperament. They exasperate Shadid with their meltdowns, their lack of promptness, their endless litanies of inshallah (God willing) and boukra (tomorrow).
The injury wasn't as serious this time as it was in 2009. After a few weeks rest, Wheating was back at it. He beat a strong field to win a 1,500 in Los Angeles two weeks ago in his first open race this year. This is very early for him.

The running sketch giving the episode its title involves the annoying alt-couple, Spyke (Fred Armisen) and Irys (Brownstein). You may recognize Spyke as the haranguing "bicycle rights!" guy from season 1, the one with a goatee and giant holes in his pierced ear lobes. And he hasn't gotten any less self-righteously irritating. True to how they spell their names, Spyke and Irys are working overtime to let everyone know that they're not like conventional types. Which makes their meeting with a primly professional wedding planner (played by the actress who was the patient waitress in season 1's Colin the chicken sketch) appropriately ridiculous.
Peter played as a high school student and as a young man in the Army. In his 20s, he was working for the city of Carson in California when an acquaintance suggested he look into officiating recreation league games.

Our conscious reactions reflect our conscious values. In the case of campaigns, for most people, those values include a belief that people should run on their merits and stop tearing each other down. But unconsciously, our brains are highly reactive to threat — especially when, as in the case of an ad, the threat isn't immediately countered or refuted. A well-crafted positive ad can "stick" too, but there's nothing like a sinister portrayal of a greedy, self-centered villain, replete with grainy images and menacing music, to stir up our unconscious minds.

Climbing is, indeed, the most humbling part of cycling. The key is to optimize what's known as your power-to-weight ratio.

There was the defense letting tight end Rob Gronkowski run wild as if this were a bye-week trip to Vegas, giving up eight catches for 113 yards and two touchdowns. There was a missed chip-shot field goal on the first drive that set the tone, and a brutal face-mask penalty on safety Eric Smith that kept a touchdown drive before halftime alive, and a fumbled punt after a crucial defensive stop. There was the clock management snafu, when Sanchez called a time out on a scoring drive before halftime that gave the Patriots an extra 20 seconds or so when they got the ball back.

Dosa masala, the most traditional dosa, is usually made with lentils and rice that are soaked overnight in water, then ground up into a smooth batter and allowed to ferment for up to 12 hours or even longer in cold weather. Cooks heat a griddle until very hot, sprinkle it with water, moisten it with oil, then pour on the batter and spread it out in circular strokes until a round pancake forms, crisping up on the outside while staying slightly spongy inside, with a sourdough flavor. It is eaten with sambar, a soupy, South Indian dal, coconut chutney, and usually potato masala, a spiced potato filling.
Not so for Will Bousquette III, a 9-year-old at The Browning School in Manhattan. Assistant librarian Susan Levine invited Denenberg to the private Upper East Side prep school for boys after choosing his book for her third-grade reading group for fathers and sons.
However, the 25-year-old right-hander managed to minimize the damage. He struck out Harper with two on in the first, and would've gotten out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the second with only one run had the right side of the IronPigs defense not lost Corey Brown's two-out pop-up in shallow right. Instead of the third out, it fell untouched for a go-ahead run-scoring double before Dom Brown ran down Seth Bynum's liner in left to end the inning.

Thursday night, after a four-day trial and four hours of deliberation, a St. Louis Circuit Court jury found Patton guilty of murdering the boy's mother, Keneka Elliott, 24, and uncle, Julius Elliott, 29.

In the Christian tradition, for example, the Emerging Church invites participation from all who find themselves attracted to the teachings, actions and person of Jesus. It isn't crucial that members call themselves Christians, or that they believe Bible stories literally (rather than metaphorically), or even that they are believers rather than agnostics and atheists. As long as people want to sincerely engage with the teachings of Jesus and with the communities that seek to live by those values — "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," "Love your neighbor," "Blessed are the peacemakers" — they are welcome.
"Even though we’re having fun, we want to remember him and what happened," said Morgan Dundon, a freshman from Baltimore who enlisted four friends to wear black shirts for Clementi.

He returned a week after the incident.
The home's director of nursing told police that neither Jones nor his roommates had been on morphine. She said the three residents who did take the drug, because of cancer, had rooms across from the nurse's station and were watched closely. Those patients, staff told police, could not have given Jones their morphine pills because they are checked to assure that their pills are swallowed.
Rogers, who has shown poor judgment before he even serves his first day in elected office, did make one important point to Plain Dealer reporter Pat Galbincea after Friday's meeting: Nothing is etched in stone.

On Wednesday, speaking at a tea party event in Tucson, Santorum diverted from his usual rhetoric about foreign policy to talk about “those who seek to oppress – yes, evil forces around the world.” He then brought up Reagan, saying: “Ronald Reagan was courageous enough to go out and speak out about the forces of evil, not just around the world but, by the way, in this country. … Why? Because America stands for something. We stand for goodness, we stand for freedom, we stand for human rights, we stand for the dignity of every human person. That is who we are.”
She said he signed his name as Clarence, but otherwise was known to all as Clancy.

I wonder if that isn't too much. Say a teacher starts at a typical salary of $35,000. Payments on a loan that big would equal $400 a month over 10 years. That's a chunk out of a $2,900 monthly salary before taxes.
“We’re dotting our I’s and crossing our T’s,” said Miller, who reports to Reed. “We spent a lot of time with this.”

Bagley said the team had been briefed on the plan, and said an early version included having the state pay for stadium infrastructure costs and offer a 5.9 percent, low-interest loan to the team and others to build the project. The plan, according to Bagley, would have the team and its business partners pay more than 80 percent of the stadium's cost and is not site-specific.

Many Ohioans also will receive a lump sum within the next two weeks to cover up to seven weeks of missed payments when the program was frozen after it ran out of funding on June 2.
It's easy to second-guess the coverage, or the lack of it, with the benefit of 10 years of hindsight. I was in charge of the Metro operation for several years in the '90s myself, and I can tell you that things that seem obvious today didn't look as clear then.
Over the weekend, Jolie met with Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino in the capital city, Quito, and also showed up at Providencia, a settlement in the rain forest near the banks of the San Miguel River, which forms Ecuador's border with Colombia.

"This has nothing to do with my life. It's totally a fantasy," says co-writer and director Wes Anderson of his film about two misfit 12-year-olds who, pledging eternal love, run away to a small, New England island. "But I remember the experience of being a fifth-grader, and how powerful the feeling of being in love was at that age, and how important a fantasy world is." The disillusioned grown-ups are played by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton, but their star power didn't earn them any cossetted treatment on location in Rhode Island. With no dressing rooms, they were asked to come to set "camera ready," which Anderson says helps move filming along. "When people are in the theater they take care of themselves," he points out. "I mean, sometimes someone doesn't want to walk through their hotel lobby in a police uniform but Bruce Willis" — who plays a cop — "wasn't staying in a hotel, so that wasn't a problem." (May 25)
They can follow a scavenger hunt to discover what fruits and vegetables look like just as the season is in its first blush of summer, help transplant sunflowers which visitors can watch grow to a towering 10 feet during the summer, discover a wetland that runs through the mini-farm, meet the farm animals, and try tasty treats straight from the farm at the farm stand. Competitive spirits can enter the strawberry pie contest or try their hand at a plant identification contest. This is a great way to meet your local farmer and enjoy a day on the farm with the whole family.
Edna O'Brien, the distinguished Irish writer, is Byron's latest biographer, and she defines "Byronic" as denoting "excess, diabolical deeds and rebelliousness." It also connotes a certain impetuous and passionate intensity, which isn't a bad description of the spirit that animates O'Brien's own work. The fascination she finds in that implicit kinship is one of the things that makes "Byron in Love: A Short Daring Life" such a pleasure to read. This is a book not only for those who value perceptive, independent intelligence, but also for those who treasure lovely writing for its own sake. At this stage in her long career -- and who can believe that O'Brien is now in her 79th year? -- this is an author who seems incapable of composing a clumsy or uninteresting sentence.
With an incumbent governor seeking a second term, the statewide ticket for the Democratic Party will look a lot like it did four years ago. The trick for Montee and Co. is to repeat the party enthusiasm from 2008, as well.
-- I liked Meachem; he has something that the Rams lack: vertical speed. But it's also legit to ask if he could be the No. 1 receiver. He was a complementary receiver (and a good one) in New Orleans. With all of the weapons the Chargers have on offense, this is a great fit for him. He may have had a hard time in STL because of the Rams' unimposing group of receivers. (At least as it stands right now.)

What should not be normal is confusion about the mechanics of voting. Especially in Cuyahoga County, voters have complained about a perception of frequently changing ground rules. They've also been surprised by the unusually lengthy ballot printed in both Spanish and English as part of a voting rights agreement between the Board of Elections and the U.S. Justice Department; it will take time for voters to grow accustomed to the change.
"It was the 1960s," he said. "People were talking about landing a man on the moon. People weren't thinking of limitations at that point."
CJ: If I knew that, I'd be on Jon Embree's staff. Seriously, this has been going on for decades. I don't know that we'll ever be an Alabama or Florida. When those major universities play and the television posts either the starters or rosters, nearly every player is from that state.

The first and foremost consideration is your son's academic record. Remember that colleges will look at his sophomore year grades just as they would a traditional applicant's junior year grades. Does his transcript show a strong GPA in advanced courses? Is he meeting the minimum requirements for admissions, including standardized tests? He will need to complete all of his high school's graduation requirements, including four years of English, before he can get his high school diploma. He will need to demonstrate an ability to complete the requisite courses before he enrolls in any university. I typically only recommend early graduation for students who are excelling and will run out of courses to take if they stayed for senior year. Remember that he will be compared to traditional applicants academically and will need to stand out in the crowd.

Day boat scallops ($28) were perfectly seared, garnished impressively with a foam of red pepper juice. Pork chops ($28), glazed in pomegranate, were moist and sweet. Beef tenderloin ($34) had an honest-to-goodness texture of velvet. Just as lovely -- if not more -- are the accompaniments; sweet potato puree is so much more than an afterthought, and is prepared with Tahitian vanilla bean. How precious is that? Roasted Mediterranean Bronzini ($28) was a special for the evening; it was also lovely and light, although the most impressive part of this entree was the shrimp and English pea risotto, abundantly creamy and flavorful and studded with quite a few succulent shrimp.

About 180 workers will be laid off, but electric rates won't change because the plants are closing. Midwest Generation, which bought the coal plants from ComEd in 1999, sells its power on the open market and, like many other coal-dependent companies, has found it increasingly difficult for its smallest, least-efficient plants to compete with nuclear power, natural gas, wind energy and newer coal plants.

Mark Purdy, San Jose Mercury News: "In Internet vote, Patrick Marleau won the ‘Fan Favorite' award at the conclusion of the Sharks' regular season. He may be forcing a recall vote in the playoffs. Marleau was hardly the sole reason the Sharks lost Thursday's game . . . But he was the face of the defeat. And he probably deserved to be. Sometimes it's hard to keep reminding yourself that Marleau is the Sharks' all-time leader in game-winning playoff goals (13) as well as in career playoff points (88). For all that, the man has a habit of stringing together postseason games where he has little to no impact on anything, including beer sales. Then, when you least expect it, he pops up to score a big goal. Now would be a good time for that to happen. Because so far in four games against the Blues, Marleau is back in his non-impact mode. His well-known climate-control personality -- he never gets too excited or too angry, just stays even keel -- only multiplies the perception that he's lacking in passion to compete."

Bass player Luke Top and guitarist Lewis Pesacov were longtime friends with a shared love for world music when they started fronting informal African-inspired dance sessions two years ago at clubs like Spaceland. The sound caught on, and soon musicians from across the city were clamoring to sit in with the ever expanding ensembles. I think people used to come to our shows just so they could jump onstage, jokes Top. With a current roster of 10 to 12 musicians on any given night, playing a distinctive hybrid of dance sounds from West Africa, Eritrea and Ethiopia, there just arent a lot of bands out there like Fools Gold, says Spacelands Frank. For good measure, Top sings in Hebrew. After a monthlong residency at the Echo recently, the bands first EP is due out this fall on I Am Sound Records. But theyre not done evolving. This is dance music. Were probably going to add some synth elements, says Pesacov, and keep on getting dancier.

The southern cities are generally more affluent – because property values are higher near the beach. They often contract with outside agencies for their public safety and can more easily tailor their spending to their finances. They don't have to carry the cost of such things as police training and helicopter patrols. However, there is a tradeoff to the cost savings. They generally have fewer officers than cities with their own departments and, consequently, citizens wait longer for police to arrive.

This residual roughness and collective spirit is reflected in Portland's ever-growing art scene, characterized by a plethora of "alternative spaces." Just what is an alternative space? Philosophically, they're less about art's being—art objects displayed and for sale—than they are about artists becoming—creating circumstances free from market pressures and the need to hobnob with the rich (who are, after all, the only people able to buy even modestly priced art with any regularity).
Candidates also have to identify contributions from political action committees, and McIntosh was the more successful in that area. He raised $62,250 from PACs, compared with Brooks' $16,900.

At Jasper's Corner Tap, bartender Kevin Diedrich blends, kegs and puts his Negroni on tap; the result has become a fixture at the bar. Other bartenders up and down the West Coast have thrown batches of Negronis into a barrel, most notably at Clyde Common in Portland. Even weeks of oak aging add a sherry-like character, tannin and the vanilla notes of a charred barrel.
For example, they might get volunteers to dress in period costumes at each landmark around the city telling what happened at each location. Get some character actors out there, perhaps a high school student who could earn community service points or college students, especially history majors, who could earn internship credit. There are a lot of seniors who would be delighted to be in costume, too, and who probably have a wealth of information. We have trolleys and free buses which can be used — included in the price of tours — to ferry tourists and local residents who want to learn about Baltimore's rich history.

All KA asks for this Christmas is help with the basics many of us take for granted: food, rent and utilities. But some toys and games for her little boy and girl would make Christmas sweeter.

In the 1960s, the London-born Sassoon was a beauty pioneer akin to fashion rebels like Mary Quant, releasing women from stiff, high-maintenance looks and putting them in sleek, wash-and-go wedges, bobs and other less-is-more crops, most famously Mia Farrow's Rosemary's Baby pixie, which earned him $5,000. Other A-list locks lopped included Rita Hayworth's, Nancy Kwan's and Twiggy's.

Sone shows a creative California flair with "Lissa's Staff Meal'' ($18), clearly demonstrating there's much more to sashimi than knowing how to slice raw fish. The chef makes "noodles'' out of long chewy strips of cuttlefish and mounds them in the center of a burnished origami-like bowl with a julienne of daikon, burdock root stained orange to look like carrots, precise rounds of sliced okra, orange salmon eggs and sea urchin. A quail egg, held upright by a dab of wasabi, is meant to be blended with the fiery condiment, poured over ingredients and tossed. The seductively slick okra, the silky slip of egg and the velvety but chewy texture of the fish play beautifully against the crunch of vegetables. Although there's a lot going on, each flavor is distinctive,

A: I actually didn't watch "The Social Network" while I was doing the book kind of deliberately because I didn't want it to color anything I was writing or reviewing or anything else. Then when I saw the movie, there's a shot at the beginning of the movie of Harvard Square, where I found the magazine with the Altair on the cover. That and some of the other things in that movie were kind of strange echoes of some of the things that happened in the book. That's kind of an interesting aspect. I think when you get someone doing a magazine excerpt they look kind of for the thing that's going to attract the most attention and cause the most interest. I think if you read the whole book cover to cover ... you've read the whole book, right?

TR: It's good for me now. I have a really good feel for it now. It's more of an out pitch, I think. But it's something that I definitely want to have that I can flip in 2-0. Not only flip it in there, but be effective with it and possibly induce some groundballs when I can with it. For me right now, it's something that I throw under the zone more now than in the zone. That isn't a bad thing because I won't get hurt there. But I want to have the feel for the in-the-zone one and the out-of-the-zone one. Right now it's basically out of the zone for me.

But Manning decided to visit Denver first. Elway low-keyed the approach during the discussions, answered the critical questions and asked the correct questions.

When the Dolphins and the Cardinals were replaced by the Titans and the 49ers as contenders, the Broncos held steady and hoped.

Pasta, however, is hit-and-miss. In the bad old days, it was routinely cooked to mush. Nowadays, the problem is often undercooking. That happened to both the spaghetti ($16) with squash and tomato sauce (which desperately needed a hit of cheese), as well as the corzetti ($15), coinlike disks draped in a salty beef ragu. In contrast, the gnocchi ($15), kicked up with pancetta and broccoli rabe, were just right.

The Pacers outrebounded the Magic 16-5 in the third quarter and did a much better job taking care of the basketball.

The pedal steel is a network of pedals, levers and strings.
