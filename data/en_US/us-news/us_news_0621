The governor also signed Ohio's $55.8 billion budget for the two years that began July 1. Just for the record, Ohio could never write a state budget but for the dedication and professionalism of a key group of public employees: the men and women of the Legislative Service Commission, the House and Senate clerks' offices and the state Budget Office and Taxation Department and the patient-as-Job aides who staff the four legislative caucuses -- House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans.

FOR A director of conscience who can make his camera do anything, the realization that he has it in him to inspire absolute dread must be supremely unsettling. (I'm not thinking of "Jaws," which was comic-book dread.) What surely must prey upon Spielberg as he gets older are not the bliss-outs he is uniquely capable of creating but the horrors. The Normandy Beach landing in "Saving Private Ryan" goes way beyond the usual technical exercise; it's a fury against the flesh. In "Minority Report," Tom Cruise's John Anderton, the chief of the Department of Pre-Crime in the District of Columbia, stands before a floating computer interface and, arms waving like an impresario, whisks around its midair crime scene visuals. It's a nightmare representation of the director as puppet master, and it comes with a kicker: Anderton, whose mind is a mausoleum of horrific images, is himself a murderer-to-be.

But their members can go to neighborhoods or cities, like Denver or Pueblo, that heavily lean Democratic and register voters there, Democratic sources said.

Some destinations are distinguished by their remoteness; others by their incantatory ruggedness; still others by their mystery. The Anderson Valley, which runs about 25 miles from Yorkville to Navarro in Northern California's Mendocino County, is characterized by a little bit of all of that. On the way in you can't see much of it from the road—maybe a plume of smoke from someone's fireplace just above the ridgeline, possibly a lone jogger. That road in tells its own oblique stories: a little house collapsed in on itself, its chimney bricks spilled like a derailed toy train; the uneven patchwork of gently sloping vineyards; aloof sheep grazing, egrets strolling; a stand of burnt and broken trees. Alongside, the skeletons of new wood-framed buildings rise, and freshly painted wine-tasting rooms pop up at intervals.

Lowe's scouting report on the Angels might be a little dated. This year's team has done very little to create offense. It's hard to go first to third -- when no one's on first. They put the leadoff man on base just once in nine innings and that was Kendrys Morales, hardly a candidate to do anything crazy on the basepaths. For the season, the Angels have put the leadoff man on base in just 55 of their 197 innings and have worked him around to score just 19 times.

The real steal: Select from the $3 beer, sangria for $3.50 a pint or $12 for a pitcher, three different wines by the glass for $4 or $4.50 each, and cocktails for $5 to $6, such as the mojito or Habibi. The appetizers  falafel with green tahini sauce, hummus and pita, and empanadas, among them  range from $2 to $3. Kasbah is right next to its sister restaurant, Tapa the World, so it shares menu items such as the empanadas and sangria, which come from Tapa.

My crystal ball is broken, so I can't say whether, after the hammer falls Wednesday night, "The Scream" will end up in a Russian oligarch's dacha, a Qatari treasure-house, a Hong Kong penthouse or elsewhere -- including a Brentwood museum. But surely it's a testament to (and perhaps an indictment of) the grossly dysfunctional era in which we live that the thought that a public institution might have the wherewithal to acquire a century-old, globally recognized masterpiece is so remote as to virtually escape consideration.

Freshman Malcolm Agnew had a spectacular debut with a freshman-record 223 yards rushing in the season opener against Sacramento State.

Calistoga, too, is set for more attention. Last December, after a lengthy bureaucratic fight, Barrett and his fellow vintners won approval for a Calistoga appellation, giving them the right to use their town's name on the label.
"Obama's proclamation, to me, just gives insight into his moral fiber. It's inappropriate for him to be speaking about it as president," Alexander said. "And to me, it's morally repugnant that the thought is expressed by the president, who should be a moral person. It's embarrassing."
Q I have rented a unit for six months as part of a 12-month lease. Since I moved in, I haven't been able to sleep properly due to the noise level that comes through the walls and the ceiling.

The bracelet ended the nightmares. On mornings she feels foggy, she grabs hold of it.
The Race So Far: Adams has yet to win anything (although she played wonderfully against type as the brassy barmaid). Steinfeld is excellent, but while a young un’ getting an Oscar for her debut isn’t unprecedented, it is rare (although sympathetic voters may vote for her anyway, feeling she was under-nominated for what’s clearly a lead). Jackie Weaver’s only prize came from the anti-commercial L.A. crowd; Bonham Carter predictably nabbed one from her subjects at BAFTA.

Conservatives can continue making the claim that Mr. Obama's health care reform law amounts to socialism and that the mandate offends the Constitution (although we would disagree with either point).

With worldwide attention now on the caves and tourism a top government priority, cave and resort developer Truong Thinh's vision of another Phuket in sleepy Quang Binh province doesn't seem as risky as when he first proposed it in 2002. About six years ago, he opened the 234-room Sun Spa Resort and more recently completed 34-beachside villas that command prices more commonly found in top Asian beach destinations.

Eventually, the Wolfman, like his movie, slows down—what good is state-of-the-art makeup and effects if no one gets to study them? Unlike the succession of glass plates used in 1941's "The Wolf Man," through which we viewed the moon-induced metamorphosis of Lon Chaney Jr., it is computerized orthopaedics that accomplish Lawrence's transition from man to wolf: His limbs contort, his face is twisted into a befanged grimace, his fingers sprout claws the size of fish knives. In keeping with wolfish tradition, it's an agonizing process, which may account for the creature's ill temper upon becoming fully lupine: He doesn't kill to feed any need besides bloodlust, and his eviscerations are graphic, grotesque and largely unnecessary—although when Mr. Del Toro is seen chowing down on some villager's liver, it may be intended as an homage to his somnambulistic co-star Mr. Hopkins (hold the fava beans).

Note the contrast between the city's deficiencies and the pretentious rhetoric about the Grand Prix. If we look at the five major Eastern cities (Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston), Baltimore has the highest homicide rate, the lowest rate of public library book circulation and the highest pedestrian death rate. It is the only city of the five without a downtown department store, the only one to place a Greyhound bus station in a location with almost no public transit and the only one to lose population over the past decade.
A wide array of medical experts, professors and researchers, plus many women whose lives have been profoundly affected by menopause, weigh in on the sensitive subject with clarity, candor and at times humor.

"Just because we've put the child into a safe home, it's not enough. We need to do repair work," said Dina Halsey, director of clinical services for the East Valley Child Crisis Center. "A lot of these children have specialized needs, and the system isn't equipped to meet those needs."

One hundred and fifty years hence, what do latter-day Californios celebrate? Cinco de Mayo seems more about finding Margaritaville than acknowledging the freedoms won at Puebla and Gettysburg. U.S. Latinos contributed blood, sweat and tears to the building of our American dream. And yet, to paraphrase the poet Octavio Paz, U.S. Latinos today seem to be living in a paradox of patriotic inequality.

In a way, the classical-jazz fusion is like an affair between people with such incompatible core traits that one wonders how they manage to tolerate each other at all. The union is fraught with two fundamental contradictions. Jazz started out as, and mostly remains, an improvised music, whereas improvisation went out of style in European classical music centuries ago and has yet to make a widespread return (aside from anomalies like Lutoslawski's limited free-form passages and Gabriela Montero's encores). And then there is the crucial issue of pulse, for classical music has its own distinct rhythms that often don't quite fit into what in jazz is called swing, or a groove.

A: My advice to people is to give up as often as possible. Eventually, you'll end up with a job you never want to leave. The amount of energy I spent trying to be inside the system, I didn't realize that was what was making me unhappy, trying to compromise the screenplays I would write, trying to get into movies I wouldn't necessarily watch, be in movies I didn't like. I really didn't listen to that voice. But I will say I got on Letterman when I was 20, and I was getting jobs at the same time my friends were getting out of college.... I tell my friends constantly to turn down work, which they do. I'm sure I'm every agent's nightmare.

Middleton was shot in the abdomen when gunfire broke out on campus. Nathaniel Pugh, another 17-year-old student from Washington, suffered an ankle wound.
The unmaintained trail forges a well-defined route as it descends from Grandview Point and peers into Grapevine and Hance canyons. During the downward twists of the Toroweap and Coconino sandstones, it teeters a bit at some particularly exposed areas and hesitates at a couple of ill-defined jumbles of boulders. Eastern views disappear when the trail drops below a sandstone fin and opens up a sea of buttes and mesas in the west. The trail finally lands on Horseshoe Mesa's Supai formation.

The first case to come to light was a boy who met Sandusky when he was 11 or 12, the grand jury said. The boy received expensive gifts and trips to sports events from Sandusky, and physical contact began during his overnight stays at Sandusky's home, jurors said. Eventually, the boy's mother reported the allegations of sexual assault to his high school, and Sandusky was banned from the child's school district in Clinton County in 2009. That triggered the state investigation that culminated in charges today.

A few months ago, my husband and I decided to rent out a room in our home to a college student who is a friend of a friend. A few nights ago, I got up to get something from the fridge and caught him humping the couch. He was facing away from me so he didn’t have any idea I was there. I was stunned and didn’t know what to do. Do I tell my husband? The university? I’m considering blackmailing him: having an able-bodied college student doing my errands might not be worse than what he did to our sofa. Thoughts?
Babbitt's final basket, a jumper with 6:59 left, gave Idaho an 84-82 lead, but Maine quickly took the lead back. With Idaho trailing by four, Babbitt committed a turnover with 2:25 left and went to the bench.

Winslow's tumultuous 2008 season coincided with the Browns' free fall as an up-and-coming team to watch to one blown up again by owner Randy Lerner.
Let's use the starting point of the Giants' being $8-9 million over the cap a few weeks ago. After that, they franchised punter Steve Weatherford, which means another $2.6 million to add to that. So we're at roughly $10.6-11.6 million over. Now, subtract the $6.75 million they saved on the Eli Manning restructure and the $5 million they saved by cutting Brandon Jacobs and you have then anywhere from $150,000 to $1.15 million under.
People that have metal awnings - don't they ever wash them or paint them? They really date a house. And they don't look nice. They keep their grass looking nice, but they never do anything with awnings or shutters, especially the metal kind. Keep them clean or painted, because they really detract from the neighborhood. They really aggravate the rest of the people on the block.
"I think the more information we have on the streetcar, the better," said Councilor Mary Olson.
Like that film, “The Town” takes an interest in how men work together on a complicated caper (and how they work against each other when the past or dreams of the future get involved). Like that film, it also has a slam-bang, middle-of-the-day urban gun battle.
“I just think it was a good team effort today,” Braender said. “We had some good at-bats and we really stepped up the defense. We got out of some innings (through double plays and forcing Hamilton to twice strand runners at third base) and that’s big for momentum.”
Service at Dosa has always been helpful, but somewhat forgetful. Staff members know the menu and can help inexperienced diners make their way through the selections, but at times they can become distracted. On one visit, for example, we never received a dish we had ordered, and on another we chose a Gruner Veltliner from the well-crafted wine list, but we had to remind the waiter about it after we had eaten several appetizers.

On Halloween 2010, B and her three daughters were walking down the street when the four of them were hit by a car. They all suffered extensive injuries. The youngest girl, now 6, was paralyzed. She requires a feeding tube and has trouble breathing. By the time she was released from the hospital, B lacked appropriate housing, so the little girl was taken into the custody of the Children's Division. B has remained strong through all of this, and she wants to bring her family back together. She needs help finding a place to live, and she'll need help to furnish it. Food and clothing are in short supply, too - and B would like to be able to do something for her girls for Christmas.

What Luka's serves is not even vaguely related to pub grub. How about Hawaiian bigeye tuna carpaccio with arugula, preserved lemons and black olive oil ($9)? Instead of fried calamari, you might settle for oysters with cava mignonette ($2-$2.50 each for Point Reyes, Hog Island or Kumamoto). Nachos? You could nibble on fat, crisp-crusted, mealy Belgian fries ($3 small; $5 large), served in a parchment-lined metal cone with a trio of dipping sauces: a somewhat timid herbed aioli, a kicky chipotle aioli and ketchup with an attitude -- it's spiked with smoked paprika.
"There is nothing I can say. It was fun to watch," Yoo said. "But it didn't surprise me."

Lisa Fleisher/Statehouse BureauLawyer Anne Murray Patterson was nominated today to serve on the N.J. Supreme Court by Gov. Chris Christie during a press conference at the Statehouse in Trenton. Patterson would replace Justice John Wallace, the only African-American member of the state's highest court. Wallace was informed today by Christie that he would not receive his backing for lifetime tenure. In a morning press conference, Christie said he is nominating Morris County attorney Anne M. Patterson to the state’s highest court. He said the court has overstepped its bounds in the past three decades and that he wanted to reshape it into one that interprets New Jersey’s constitution and laws.
When Chetry asked whether the misstatements were "becoming a distraction" from Bachmann's campaign, she might as well have asked, "So, do you think our new strategy to destroy you is working?"

Five years ago today, I was asked to speak at a rally against going to war in Iraq. The vote to authorize the war in Congress was less than 10 days away and I was a candidate for the United States Senate. Some friends of mine advised me to keep quiet. Going to war in Iraq, they pointed out, was popular. All the other major candidates were supporting the war at the time. If the war goes well, they said, you'll have thrown your political career away.
Barrow, a mathematics professor and co-author of "The Anthropic Cosmological Principle" (why is the universe so finely tuned as to have permitted our evolution, when the alternatives are limitless and god-awful?), writes about complexity: "Complex adaptive systems" — that's you and me — "thrive in the hinterland between the inflexibilities of determinism and the vagaries of chaos."
