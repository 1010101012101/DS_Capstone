Still, over the years there have been occurrences at Friedens United Church of Christ, near the intersection of Highway 94 and Zumbehl Road in St. Charles, that have caused some staff members and church members to do a double take.

Not every white wine is meant to be an aperitif, and certainly not this lively Sauvignon Blanc from Domaine Ricard in Touraine, a lesser-known appellation in the Loire Valley of France.

I was not surprised to discover that, although New Yorkers in many other parts of the state can choose a Healthy NY insurer from several options, I only had one: Excellus BlueCross BlueShield. I was just glad to learn that I could get insurance. A phone call led to an additional choice, through the same insurer, that would let me see my own doctors. But it would have cost around $1,400 a month, which is the same as my mortgage. There was also a plan for sole proprietors, but I didn't qualify.

Jerusalem has always invoked deep emotions, slogans and wishful thinking. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at AIPAC's conference in Washington two weeks ago, repeated the mantra that "Jerusalem will always be united," he received a standing ovation. I doubt whether those in the audience really knew what they were applauding for, and if in their short visits to Jerusalem they saw more than just the lobby of the King David Hotel.
The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office was trying to determine the cause of death.

"Gingrich is not nearly the conservative that everybody thinks he is," said Mike McKenna, a Republican lobbyist and strategist unaffiliated with the presidential campaigns. "He is surging because some chunk of the electorate sees him as the authentic conservative in the race. Romney doesn't need to prove he's the authentic conservative.

Mr. Palfrey: I disagree with Prof. Liebowitz. It may be right that YouTube/Google is more likely to be sued if they leave the policing to the copyright holders, but I do think it's sounder policy. I think that YouTube/Google's best approach long-term is in fact not to take an active role in determining what goes on the site. Instead, I think that they should be letting any user post any user-generated content, so long as the user agrees, through the site's terms of service, not to post anything that violates anyone else's copyright. Then, if YouTube/Google hears from anyone that their copyrighted works have been reproduced on the YouTube site, then YouTube/Google should make an assessment of whether or not to take down the allegedly copyrighted works -- and to ban access to the site for repeat offenders, pursuant to the requirements of the DMCA.
But the Gophers apparently aren't hesitating when they see a player they want, either. According to Gopher Illustrated, a rivals.com website that closely tracks college recruiting, Kill offered Tartan High School defensive back Keelon Brookins a scholarship a couple of weeks after wrapping up the 2012 class, and the Oakdale athlete accepted. That makes Brookins the first member of the Gophers' Class of 2013, although the Titans senior-to-be said he still will make visits to other campuses. Several other high school seniors-to-be also have received scholarship offers from the Gophers.

A possible motive for Iran's keeping the al-Qaida figures under custody is as insurance against possible retaliation attacks by the terror group. Also there could be used as bargaining chips with the West. In 2003, Iran received rare Western praise after giving the U.N. Security Council the names of 225 al-Qaida suspects detained after illegally crossing into Iran. The suspects were later deported to their countries in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

Attempts to work out the wrinkles in the policy with Catholic bishops only emphasized the administration's high-handedness. In a recent letter to his fellow bishops, Cardinal Timothy Dolan recounted how staffers from the Catholic Conference of Bishops were told there weren't any wrinkles. Nothing proved negotiable. The rule had been published in the Federal Register. And by the way, why don't you bishops listen to more enlightened voices in the church? In other words, the government was saying, as Dolan put it, that we bishops simply do not know or understand Catholic teaching.
The federal program was created in 2000 to reimburse local communities for lost income from the sale of timber on federal lands. Counties get 25 percent of the revenue from federal timber sales, but when logging plummeted, so did revenue.

As Mr. Einhorn's own firm prospered, he could have jammed far more money into his Allied Capital short position, determined to prevail by brute force. He didn't.

Such discipline, we come to realize, is what distinguishes the wisest long-term investors from obstinate short-timers who veer between triumph and ruin.

This one’s easy. As has been the case all year, Djokovic is the ATP Tour’s best player. Don’t even worry about the fact that he had to retire last week in the Mason, Ohio, final against Andy Murray with a bum shoulder. He’ll be just fine — and is in position to win his third Grand Slam event this year. When (not if) he gets through the third round, Djokovic will be 60-2 in 2011. That would surpass John McEnroe’s 59-2 start in 1984. The only possible stumbling block: A semifinal date with Roger Federer, the only other person to beat Djokovic this year.

The idea is that to offset the power of large donors, citizens without deep pockets should be encouraged to flood the system with small contributions that the government would match. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has pledged to a state overhaul of this sort, based on the one already in force for New York City elections. In his state of the state address in January, Cuomo spoke of how urgent it is to "reconnect the people to the political process and their government." He could make himself into a reform hero across the country if he and the Legislature created a model law for other states, and the nation.

“I loved the irreverence, the willingness to question everything,” Noth says. “In society, we have these unspoken rules of conduct, these ‘shoulds.’ Even though we pride ourselves on being a democracy, there are all these ways we say you ‘should’ behave.

But it drowned out the flavor of the Pumpkin Curry ($9.95-$15.95). I order this red curry made with coconut milk at every Thai restaurant. It's almost become a ritual and a culinary reference point for me. Lone Tree Thai's was semi-bland and a bit oily. Plus, the chunks of pumpkin were unevenly cooked, leaving a disappointing powdery texture in my mouth.

"The most powerful force -- always -- in this issue, and the most cost-effective way to deal with a drug problem is to prevent the use of drugs. And that doesn't flow directly from government, it really flows from parents," said White House advisor Gil Kerlikowske, director of National Drug Control Policy. "Time and again the research demonstrates that parents are the most powerful force, and the most powerful voice and the most listened-to voice in the lives of young people."
"It took a lot of my explosiveness away," Whiteside said. "I mean I could still block shots because that's really just timing. But being more athletic, it took a lot of that away and that's when I knew it was time, I had to get surgery."

Hey, David: I am in total agreement.
Any increase in revenues from this increase would likely be insignificant, especially considering that it would no doubt drive many investors offshore. Germany, Holland, Mexico, India and numerous other countries have no capital gains taxes. Many others, including Canada, China and Japan, have rates much lower than 30 percent.
Your editorial criticizes this legislation by saying it "stomps on the authority of local government." From the perspective of any business that operates in more than one jurisdiction, that makes no sense. Illinois has a well-earned reputation of being a difficult place to do business. One of the primary reasons is the patchwork quilt of taxes, fees and often contradictory regulations in place in different local governments. To be successful, recycling must be convenient and clear.

Yet the boon of the Santa Cruz Mountains is that tremendous fruit has shone, even through the static of wobbly cellar work.

The exercise capped a two-hour practice of wisecracks and wit, puns and ploys designed to fine-tune the budding comedy skills of a group that regularly stages on-campus shows, often requesting material from their audiences.

Many people who used to pay their bills, say "happy birthday" or just keep in touch by mail now do those things online and avoid mailboxes altogether. That's helped push theU.S. Postal Serviceto the brink of bankruptcy, and postal officials now must try to catch up with the changing times by cutting costs, which in turn means closing post offices and mail processing centers. In December, Congress agreed to a five-month moratorium on closures, but the respite expires May 15. Then California is likely to lose 15 mail processing centers, including up to five in Los Angeles County.

That spirit can be found in everything from the jaunty popular songs like "Back to Market Street" and "Sleeping on Frisco Bay" that were composed soon after the quake to the Beat poetry movement of the 1950s, the drug-hazed Haight-Ashbury sensorium of the 1960s and the flowering of experimental art, music and performance that continues to the present day.

Everett Golson and Andrew Hendrix, probably in that order, now can be considered the presumptive favorites to be the choice Notre Dame's coach cannot get wrong entering an arduous 2012 season — at least not if Kelly anticipates keeping the same mailing address for 2014 or 2015.

"We’re not trying to make them hall monitors. Most will respect the rules, and if not, they will tell them," said Weinstein, adding that officials expect customers to self-police the ones who make noise.

At its peak, the academy enrolled close to 1,000 students in grades kindergarten to 12. That brought in more than $21.5 million from the state over the school's lifetime of less than five years.
Bowlin said the city had to design the program from scratch, including eligibility requirements and an application process. And there was an additional layer of red tape, she said, because the city will use federal block grant money.
Seven teachers and staff at the Ladue School District were told Friday they'd be laid off when the school year is over, news which has students set to show their support Monday.

Sacramento City Unified officials recently voted to close one school, and strongly considered shuttering two others. It's a common occurrence these days: School districts across the region have closed 80 schools during the past six years as birth rates decline, neighborhoods mature and families increasingly move from the city to the suburbs.

When Eli and Jimmy get a look at the enfeebled Commodore, Eli is horrified and suggests a doctor might be a good idea. “Nobody can take care of him like his family,” coos Gillian. OK, Lady Macbeth. It’s clear who’s in charge now, and it’s not sulkin’ Jimmy. Nucky hosts a whore-happy party for the mayor where the guest, Jack Dempsey included, are serenaded by Eddie Kessler, a wonderful use of the multi-talented Anthony Laciura, an operatic tenor.

At the event, the moderator asked a question about drilling for oil and gas in Alaska, a proposal the three candidates  Hoekstra, American Family Association of Michigan president Gary Glenn and charter-school founder Clark Durant  supported as a way to make American more energy independent.
Although I've never had any spiritualist training, I've been to Cassadaga a handful of times and it's always an interesting, relaxing destination. The bookstore is nice and it's tucked in a community along a stretch of rural road that's about as close to country as Florida gets.
There are still plenty of engineering tasks ahead. The team will need to design a way for their robot to pick up the basketballs. Jani talked about a system that would "pinch then lift the balls" and place them into a hopper.

The Christie plan is based on a federal model, officials said, which offers hundreds of plans to participants and requires them to pay 34 percent of the cost of the selected coverage.
2. This box is pre-checked for your convenience. A car rental agent who wants to make your life miserable can also pre-check a box on your lengthy car rental contract, in which you indicate your acceptance of the optional insurance. (Collision-damage waivers are one of the most profitable add-ons for car rental companies, so the bottom line might also have something to do with it.) That's what happened to Jim Strohmeier when he rented a car in Las Vegas recently. "They charged my credit card for car insurance, even though I did not check the box on the contract where it is indicated to select insurance," he said. When he requested a copy of the contract, the car rental company backed down and credited him for the insurance.

floor-to-ceiling half-wall. One portion of the room held a sofa bed and kitchenette, complete with small refrigerator, microwave and sink. The other portion had a king-size bed and small dresser. The bathroom was small but adequate. A flat-screen television could be watched from either side of the room.
Finally, the judges. In some states, a judge can evaluate the prosecution's case and if he determines that it is lacking the strength for a conviction, he can order the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. I don't know if Illinois judges have this authority, but I do not remember seeing the report of such an acquittal in the newspaper. If Illinois judges don't have this power, they should get it. If they currently have it, they should start to use it when there are indications of tainted evidence, testimony or inadequate preparation on the part of the prosecution.

New York City’s Battery Park receives about $4.2 million annually from a state authority, the Battery Park City Authority, but spends less per acre than the Greenway. The $9.2 million budget, the majority of which is funded by area residents and businesses, pays for the 36-acre park on the southern tip of Manhattan.
The least understood but essential element in the cleanup is capping, which leaves PCBs in the riverbed but buries them under a layer of sand, or sand and rock, sometimes in combination with an impermeable material to seal contaminants from the water. But capping will be contentious in negotiations, because it means leaving ugly stuff in the muck on the promise it won't leak out during scouring floodwaters or even seismic disruption.
"So (a patient named Jack) weighs 300 pounds and the doctor tells Jack to lose weight, and Jack leaves and the doctor gets $75 for telling him" what the patient already knows, Armstrong said. "That kind of visit happens thousands of times a day, and Medicare pays for it."

Training and weeding groups will assemble at the demonstration plot on the north side of Henderson Canyon Road, 1/2 mile east of the intersection with Borrego Valley Road. Volunteers are asked to wear sturdy hiking boots, sunscreen, bring water and snacks or lunch. Come prepared: Bring gloves and a hoe (preferably a "hula hoe" or stirrup hoe) or other weeding tools. The sessions are cancelled if there is rain.

I have always liked the way Jaroslav Pelikan once described tradition. "Tradition," he said, "is the living faith of the dead; traditionalism is the dead faith of the living." Traditions are fluid and dynamic, while traditionalism is static and frozen. The church is called, as the Reformed family of faith has always maintained, to be a community that is reformed and always being reformed according to the Spirit of God. For me, that means that the failure of the church's institutional structures is a bit like shedding skin. The process can be irritating and even painful, but something new is emerging.

Officials at the Bible Society, based in Baltimore, decided a few years ago that they lacked the space to show off a striking collection of antique editions from across the world. The original King James, for example, was most often kept in the director's office. Other rare Bibles were stashed in out-of-the-way cubbies where no one had seen them for years.
Woods teed off, and his new caddie and friend Bryon Bell trundled off with the bag after the ball landed in a fairway bunker. It was Woods' first competitive shot since withdrawing from The Players Championship 11 weeks ago after nine holes due to injuries to his knee and Achilles tendon.

Local hero Brad Harriman, 58, of O'Fallon, is Costello's horse in the Democratic primary. Harriman was a standout offensive lineman for Belleville East High School who went to college on athletic scholarships and played for two NFL teams in the '70s. He came home and became a teacher and coach and eventually regional superintendent of schools for St. Clair County (he's now retired). He is endorsed over Kenneth Charles Wiezer, a retired carpenter from Granite City.

There was a standout Cashner Moment this spring. The Padres were playing the Rockies. It was the ninth inning and Cashner was on the mound. Colorado had run out of position players so a minor league pitcher was sent to the plate. He took a 100-mph fastball, and when Cashner came back with a 90-mph change, the kid stepped out of the batter's box and stared out with a you've-got-to-be-kidding-me look. He soon took a seat.

Hines said local social services departments will work with the foster parents to shift them to another child placement company. If a foster parent chooses not to make that transition, Hines said, the child will have to be placed in a new foster home.
Pittsburgh's Allegheny County, though, has so far outpaced Cuyahoga County's efforts, in no small part due to a sleek reform government that replaced a slate of elected officials with one executive. Voters approved a county charter there in 1998, 11 years before Cuyahoga adopted its own.
In dating, women and men have equal rights -- but when it comes to popping that first question, it is still a man's world. In a recent Match.com survey of 5,000 single adults, only 10.8 percent of women admitted to asking a man out. Experts say that Internet dating has made it easier for women to find and contact men -- even initiate dialogue -- but that there are evolutionary reasons why tradition continues to win in the game of courtship.

Werfel compares her paintings to music and dance, which play a part in the inspiration for her works. Other sources are elements in her studio including postcards from Italian and French museums and childhood drawings of knights done by her son. These fragmentary visual impressions float in a fluid space that allows for much invention. Erasures and pentimenti form a kind of record of the process by which the paintings are made.
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy grew more slowly in the first three months of this year. Governments spent less, and businesses cut back on investment. But consumers spent at the fastest pace in more than a year.
The Bulls, who led the league in fewest points allowed and opponents' field goal percentage during the regular season, limited the Sixers to .398 shooting from the field.

I'd never had that happen before. It was really, really bad luck. I'm a really goal- oriented person, and 2,000 points became a huge goal of mine in recent weeks when I realized just how close was. I did set the women's record with 1,980 points, 10 more than Janica Kostelic's record (in 2006).

Few Chekhov fans would call "Ivanov" their favorite, but the work nonetheless holds a special place in my critical affections. A study of a "superfluous man," a recurring personality type of 19th century Russian literature that today would be treated with a boatload of antidepressants, the drama lays bare the tolerant, though by no means uncritical, approach to character that would come to define Chekhov's playwriting.
Reiterating an argument he made earlier this month, the governor said the federal government had released the money even though the tunnel did not have final approval or safeguards in place to guard against waste.

There was very little fanfare about the hiring. Not what you’d expect, anyway, when baseball’s most storied franchise brings a native New Yorker in to take charge of the team. Most of the coverage was negative, including the now infamous “Clueless Joe” headline in The Daily News, accompanied by a column saying Torre was naïve about the position and its perils.

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson has said the city will lay off 275 full-time employees including 174 police officers and firefighters because of what was expected to be a $35.7 million cut in funding from the state. It wasn't immediately clear what portion of the additional $17 million for Cuyahoga County would fall into Cleveland's lap.

Right now, there isn't enough known about the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a black, by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old part-Hispanic, during his neighborhood watch tour in an Orlando, Fla., suburb. If evidence emerges that Zimmerman's actions were not justified, he should be prosecuted and punished; however, there's a larger issue that few people understand or have the courage to acknowledge, namely that black and young has become synonymous with crime and, hence, suspicion. To make that connection does not make one a racist. Let's look at it.
The spent shell casings that often litter the street and sidewalks around Ray's Sausage Co. are one sign of the normalcy. So is the open drug trafficking, prostitution, and flagrant disregard for traffic laws.

Why is the Documents In The Cloud interface optimized for such a small collection of files? I suspect it's because users are more likely to rely on cloud storage just for those dozen or three files that they're working with on a daily or a weekly basis. But I worry that this design could be an early sign that Apple might be steering Mac OS away from people like me and are optimizing the experience for folks who tend to operate with just dozens of files on a 64-gigabyte solid-state drive. Users who don't put so many demands on a computer and don't expect it to do everything.

In North Carolina, the town of Wilson abuts the highway just below Rocky Mount. It's home to historic Fleming Stadium, a classic minor-league ballpark built in the 1930s.

HOME RUNS: 24 (2nd, tied)
In the second (and far less divisive) offering of peace from Norway this month, the Norwegian folk duo Kings of Convenience returns with its fourth studio album. Singer-guitarists Eirik Glambæk Bøe and Erlend Øye are often typecast as a postdated Simon & Garfunkel, and the comparison isn’t entirely unjust. On this lovely, lilting record, Bøe and Øye unite their breathy tenors in intoxicating harmonies that, with elegant foundations of acoustic guitar, make for an ideal lazy-morning record. The instrumentation is spare, but these delicate pieces might buckle beneath anything more than the occasional violin, piano, or acoustic bass to flavor them. The Kings stretch instead with shifts of rhythm and form: “Mrs. Cold” floats on a bossa nova buoy; “My Ship Isn’t Pretty” whispers hints of Spanish guitar; “Riot on an Empty Street” echoes the chamber pop of Belle and Sebastian.

Arastradero Road was downsized from four to two lanes and staff said all would be fine. The result: long delays during commute hours.
