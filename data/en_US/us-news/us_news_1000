Musically, it’s a Springsteen sampler skipping from the acoustic folk jams of his 2006 “Seeger Sessions” to arena anthems most associated with the Boss. On this powerhouse CD, Springsteen seems inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement, with several derogatory references to “fat cats,” “the banker man” and “robber barons” while praising the working stiff. When he’s not letting us know this land is our land, as on “We Take Care of Our Own,” Springsteen reminds us how love rejuvenates the soul in the very uplifting, yet misnamed, song “This Depression.”

Wu-Tang somewhat epitomizes the chip a lot of Staten Islanders carry on their shoulders as the negated New Yorkers. So, it is no surprise that Raekwon, Ghostface, Masta Killa et. al, clearly stated that every verse, hook and beat had to be epic and impactful. This passion ultimately helped put Staten Island on the map and solidify its place in hip-hop history.

6. London Calling: Hot on the heels of Will and Kate upping its hip factor, the UK is buzzing for 2012, says expert Kerstin Sowden. Monarchists will be going for Queen Elizabeths Jubilee in June and sports fans from around the world for the Summer Games.

Before I reviewed Farmshop in Brentwood, I wanted to wait until chef-owner Jeffrey Cerciello opened for dinner. That took a while, almost a year, in fact, while his application for a beer-and-wine license made its way through the bureaucracy. He could have started dinner without it but chose not to. Meanwhile, he continued to serve breakfast, lunch and brunch. Nice, but from a chef of his caliber, you want to have dinner.

The metaphoric weight of a ship journey is impossible to avoid — all of these people are caught between worlds, between old lives and an uncertain future. Today's traveler sees a 12-hour plane flight as an annoying interruption, a dead space best handled with iPods, magazines, movies and a nap. But on a journey like this one, a three-week voyage through three oceans (Indian, Mediterranean, Atlantic) and two seas (Red and Arabian), life is still lived and lessons are still learned — especially by our narrator, named Michael (though not the author, Ondaatje tells us in a note), who made the trip to join his mother in London when he was 11.

The Posada Barrancas Mirador hotel is literally built on the rim of the canyon. In the past, it was jammed with tourists, but I was one of only 17 guests on a night in early November. That meant the Mirador's "happy hour with a view" felt less like a money-making diversion for tourists and more like a small, pleasant gathering of friends. As I sat in a comfy leather chair sipping a local grain alcohol known as Sotol in front of a fireplace, I could fantasize that this was my own private lodge to which I had invited a few guests for a quiet evening.

It passed Congress -- the Senate and the House -- and the President signed it into law.

The Raiders are on the clock right now at No. 7 and so far, no wide receivers have been selected. Right now, you would think Texas Tech's Michael Crabtree would be the smart pick, but I said smart and I'm talking about the Raiders. If they go with Missouri's Jeremy Maclin or Maryland's Darrius Heyward-Bey, Crabtree could start to slide. The Jaguars up next might be interested, but they have other needs after signing Torry Holt.

As distinctive as Edwin is, he is just one of a new wave of Indonesian filmmakers testing boundaries as the country figures out just how liberated it wants to be since a dictatorship dissolved in 1998. Popular, Jakarta-based indie director Teddy Soeriaatmadja has a film in competition here as well. His "Lovely Man" is a father-daughter story with cross-currents of religion and cultural taboos, since the father is a transvestite, a modern-day outcast, and the daughter is a devout young Muslim, in a country overwhelmingly Muslim, who at 19 has gotten herself in a bit of a mess.

From the outside -- and the inside -- Banning's looks like a typical roadside diner, but it has pie chops. Banana cream pie ($3.49) is elemental, consisting mostly of bananas and cream, but that is, after all, the point.

This was when I discovered the stones surrounding the pond were not all glued down (or grouted or nailed or whatever you do to keep stones from falling into a pond they are surrounding). Tiny Bits decided petting the fish was something he needed to experience RIGHT NOW and nearly threw himself bodily into the depths of the pond but I was able to keep him and the stones safely dry. Then my neighbor, not knowing my children quite as well as I do, showed the boys what happens when you feed the fish. Mainly, they go crazy nuts -- the fish and the kids -- and the boys immediately wanted to feed them more. I don't know a lot about fish, but I've heard if you feed them too much they die or explode or something so we had to put a stop to our little visit before one of them stole some fish food and decide to feed the fish themselves. Or before they got bored with trying to kill the fish and decided to see what it would take to wipe out the sod.
"This investment demonstrates our company's commitment to the St. Paul area and helps us remain our customers' supplier-of-choice for years to come," Guilherme Gerdau Johannpeter, president of Gerdau Long Steel North America, said in a news release.
And mostly, college football is still regional. The SEC has been the best conference in the country over the past few years. Anybody can see that. But the SEC also has a distinct advantage in the postseason, because the weather is almost always good and the games are often in SEC territory. (This includes two of the four BCS sites, Miami and New Orleans, along with several second- and third-tier bowl sites.) An SEC or Pac-12 team should have to play in cold weather once in a while. That is part of football.

Wally becomes obsessed with the collection, lingering so long that you may wonder why she's not arrested. Instead, one of the security guards, Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), falls for her.

Shopping as liberation; an auction paddle lifted in protest, not exactly the stuff of feminist dreams.

During the Cold War, defense planners continuously assumed the need to prepare for a possible major war against the Warsaw Pact plus at least one other conflict. After the Cold War, the big scenario went away, and U.S. ground forces were sized and shaped primarily to maintain what was called a two-regional-war capability. The wars were assumed to begin in fairly rapid succession (though not exactly simultaneously), and then overlap, lasting several months to perhaps a year or two. Three administrations and five defense secretaries, starting with President George H.W. Bush and defense chief Dick Cheney, endorsed some variant of it. And to some extent, they were all vindicated in recent years as the nation fought two overlapping regional conflicts, even if one of them was in Richard Haass's memorable phrase a "war of choice," and even if the wars went on far longer than standard planning scenarios assumed.

How would they feel if Seventh Day Adventist (one Christian group) or Jewish religious leaders lobbied for a law to make Saturday the Sabbath and to limit commerce on that day? How would they feel if Mormon church leaders or the leaders of any other religious group in our country lobbied for laws that would impact everyone regardless of their conflicting religious beliefs?

The sheer magnificence of the larger spans -- Carnegie, Superior and the Inner Belt -- was overwhelming. Never again will I drive over them without paying my respects. And yet I preferred the intimacy of the shorter, lower and more intricately engineered bridges, where we saw and heard cars and trains rumbling overhead.
"He's the epitome of what a student-athlete should be, both on and off the court," Groce said. "He's an extremely hard worker. He always gives you his best.

But I think Walt has helped our program accelerate in that area.

"They respect who I am, and what I've done and my decision to retire. They knew from Day 1 that it was a final decision for me. Not that they wouldn't have liked to have me back or hadn't thought about it, I think it's more like, ‘We respect Kurt too much to go to him whether it's to put pressure on him or even ask him to consider coming back.' For that I give them a lot of credit because I don't know if every organization would do that. I truly believe that's why I haven't really heard anything definitive from them. They respect me too much to do something like that"
“Look, you’re talking about Tom’s style falling in the basket of someone with an obsessive-compulsive style. But it doesn’t mean that it’s pathological, or maladaptive.

It seems something beyond acting, in fact. Day-Lewis is famous for immersing himself in his roles. There is no hint of the actor here, nothing given away in his eyes, in his voice, anywhere. We are invested in Plainview from the start as a man, not just a character. This performance is the embodiment of the cliche that has adorned movie posters for generations, but truly, Day-Lewis is Plainview. Anderson, meanwhile, has made good movies before (Boogie Nights, Magnolia), but this is beyond good. If There Will Be Blood is ultimately bleak, it's also a monumental achievement, a movie and performance as great as they are unforgettable.

Some of the subjects date back to the 1800s — mayors of New York, the owners of railroads, forgotten captains of industry in starched collars and flamboyant mustaches.

But I tend to believe in amplifying choices, as they create the clearest contrasts in campaigns for voters. Which is why, for Obama, I'd suggest Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Start with the narrative of change: The visual shock of a national ticket made up of an African American and a woman would be tremendous. It would be, itself, change. But Sebelius brings more to the ticket: Where Obama speaks often of unity, of reaching across the aisle, Sebelius has done it in a fairly remarkable way. Skillfully sensing that the Kansas Republican Party's drift into extremism had alienated many of its moderate members, she asked the former chair of the Kansas Republicans to become a Democrat and run as her lieutenant governor; she convinced a popular Republican district attorney to switch parties and run for attorney general; and she flipped six candidates for the state Legislature. Obama muses dreamily of common ground, but Sebelius has a proven ability to find it. Add in that she's a widely regarded chief executive who Time magazine named one of the nation's best, and it's hard to think up a better fit.

Of the myriad miscalculations made by Obama, among the most fateful has to be his assumption that a repudiation of George W. Bush was synonymous with a repudiation of conservatism. By Election Day in 2008, Bush's approval rating was at 25 percent. You cannot get that low without losing a sizable slice of your base, particularly when self-described conservatives outnumber self-described liberals by roughly 2 to 1. It was their opposition to Bush's big-government conservatism that made them the feedstock of the "tea parties."

"If we would have brought stuff that L.A. did on Tuesday or Monday, I don't think it would have any impact," he said. "The players would have forgotten it by then. So everything we (do from here on out) will be in prep for L.A. and them specifically. You have to time it properly so the players are willing to listen and learn. When it's too far away, they just want to get the work in. Now, it's the focus and the work and it's different."

Sure, there will be workplace slackers. And then there will be entrepreneurs like Ryan Breslow. At 17, he already has worked for three years at a Publix grocery store, has secured two paid internships at high-tech marketing firms and has founded three online businesses. Breslow is determined to be his own boss. In the fall, he is headed to Stanford University, where he has his sights set on an eventual start-up as promising as Google or Facebook. "I see value in working for others," he said. "But I see myself eventually in a job with limitations set only by myself."

Are you aware that the oil and gas companies actively bidding up the prices of oil and gas on in order to increase their already record profits? So who exactly are we risking our scarce water resources for by allowing hydraulic fracturing? Oh yes, guess who really really wants us to go from gasoline to natural gas for our cars and trucks? Oil and gas companies are drooling, and you are expecting lower rates? What do you think is going to happen to the costs of heating our homes with natural gas as we compete with supplying Japan and powering our cars and trucks? What do you think motivates the oil and gas industry? Lower prices? America's energy independence?

Advent is not just pre-Christmas. It is its own season, a time of spiritual searching and waiting. In that sense, it is so much more than merely the four weeks leading to the birth of Christ. It is more than a time of getting the house decorated and the gifts wrapped. In Advent, our hearts are warmed by God's grace, and our weary lives comforted by the promise of the Christ who is coming.

The top Comcast executives could have received much fatter packages last year. The company achieved substantial growth in revenue and free cash flow, but its top executives elected to bring their performance base bonus calculations more in line with how their underlings are paid.

Banking reform hasn't done it, stimulus and rescue packages haven't done it, extending the Bush tax cuts hasn't done it and all the nostrums about what will work have fallen by the wayside. Obviously the economy is oblivious to politics, laws and prescriptions. It seems to have a trajectory all its own.
"We're an evolution, at least where St. Louis Blues hockey is going," Backes said. "We don't have guys that are going to put up 100 points a year, score 60 goals a year.

It's going to have to continue to be a focal point."

Flash back to 1992, when Santa Clara County voters approved a half-cent hike in the local sales tax for road and rail improvements.

The whistlers proved to be very-low-frequency radio waves, which Helliwell began to monitor regularly and to reproduce with radio transmitters. If the entire atmosphere were electrically neutral like that at the Earth's surface, the radio waves would propagate directly into space, continuing in a straight line forever. But charged particles in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere above it can trap the waves and carry them long distances around the Earth or bounce them back to the surface the way a mirror bounces light.

Looks are deceiving. Electrocardiograms of the hearts of highly conditioned student athletes can bear a surprising resemblance to some ECGs of people with potentially dangerous heart problems, often creating false-positive results.
Michael settled in as the night proceeded, singing with greater flexibility and control. Every arena show must now include a small-band mini-set; Michael's benefited from being jazzy instead of folksy-acoustic. His rendition of Nina Simone's "Feeling Good," which he performed last season on the TV show "Eli Stone," was dynamite. Michael could make a big impact in this interpretive mode, giving Rod Stewart a serious run for his silk cravat.

Next was the St. Louis debut of Gabriele Cassone in Johann Nepomuk Hummel's trumpet concerto. It's a beautiful piece, full of charming melodies that emerge in the many dialogues between soloist and orchestra. Cassone's day job is as a professor at the Conservatory of Novara in Italy, and he played a trumpet of type that Hummel would have known, one with an early version of valves. His entrances, even on high, soft notes, were right on the money; and every line of every movement was not just played through but had interesting nuances of volume and tempo.
"I'm not too worried about it right now. We still won. It's not the meet I wanted, but it still counts," Smith said.
"In terms of ability, they both have ability," Roushar said. "Andrew's just so much more comfortable in the system.

The game was not without the usual prickliness between the Cardinals and the Brewers. In the fifth inning, Jonathan Lucroy plowed Daniel Descalso as the latter attempted to field a groundball. Lucroy's curious collision cost the Brewers a run and it led later to an obvious bit of retaliation. Kyle McClellan hit Lucroy with a pitch in the ninth inning. The next batter, George Kottaras, cashed in on the extra base runner with the first pinch-hit homer of his career. Kottaras' three-run shot to center field tidied up a game that wasn't as close as its final score.

Rafael Perez (1-0), Joe Smith, Vinnie Pestano and Chris Perez followed Hagadone with four scoreless innings of relief. Chris Perez got the first out in the ninth, but Kyle Seager singled and was replaced by pinch-runner Munenori Kawasaki. He went to third on Jesus Montero's bad-hop single that hit Donald in the mouth. Perez retired Michael Saunders on a fly ball to short left, but walked Ryan on four pitches to load the bases. He finally slammed the door by getting Jaso to fly out to left for his third save.

Mr. Staatz argues that the legislation is needed because community banks aren't lending. Nothing could be further from fact. Banks are actively lending and looking for lending opportunities. Banks earn a much higher return on loan interest than they do earnings on investments these days. Despite the sluggish economy, banks added over $180 billion in business loans over the last 18 months. Here in Maryland, more than $204 million in Small Business Administration Loans were made in 2011 alone, the vast majority by banks and the highest total in 10 years. Business lending increased 13.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and totaled $1.3 trillion, according to the FDIC.

3. Longmont beat (8) Wheat Ridge 27-14
An infinitely rarer, more exotic version of the rood screen was the rood loft, requiring a church of considerable height and scope to accommodate it. As its name implies, the loft was an enclosed structure, raised well above the building's floor, under which worshipers could pass comfortably. Normally made of elaborately carved wood, it too succumbed to the iconoclasts and the reformers. The puzzling, orphaned circular staircases on flanking sides of the nave in some ancient churches are vestiges of these structures.

The 30-second TV spots portray the "Protect Our Homes" initiative as a constraint on eminent domain. It would prohibit cities from using their condemnation powers to transfer property from one owner to the other, such as was done in the Connecticut case that drew national outrage when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it. It would also strengthen the negotiating hand of landowners whose property is being sought for schools, freeways or other public uses.

The most admirable thing about Heavy Seas Alehouse is how well it plays to both the beer expert and those indifferent to beer. Fans of Heavy Seas will find no fewer than eight brews on tap — and two on "cask" — on any given night, along with a bracing selection of beer-laced cocktails, like the rich and hearty Lost Cargo, made with Heavy Seas Peg Leg Stout, bourbon, port and bitters.
The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood and Englewood Hospital and Medical Center oppose the plan to reopen. Executives say Bergen County already has up to 400 vacant hospital beds and reopening Pascack Valley would harm existing hospitals financially.
At that figure, Facebook's valuation would also be about 33 times its advertising revenue, compared with 5.5 times for Google. The reason for the discrepancy is in large part due to the fact that Facebook is still a young company with faster growth than Google, which is worth $200 billion but had $36.5 billion in ad revenue last year.

There are a few hidden fun spots in between all the blacktop, like the 10-year-old Museum of Making Music, tucked away in the back of an office park. Why Carlsbad? Because its home to NAMM. That's what used to be called the National Association of Music Merchants, which they've ditched for just using the acronym. The temporary exhibit, "ON! The Beginnings of the Electric Sound Generation," examines how early musical pioneers harnessed electricity to amplify and modulate music. Your ringing ears after a Led Zeppelin or Lady Gaga concert are due to old-timers like Thaddeus Cahill, who invented electromechanical instruments that prefigured today's streaming audio. There are guitar pioneers like Leo Fender, who worked on taking the six string and pumping up the volume with voltage. The big draw for musicians is the "interactive" exhibit where visitors can try out a Gretsch Sparkle Jet guitar, Deering Goodtime banjo or just wail away on a set of Hapi drums.

"From the perspective of politics and clout, one of the things that is problematic is that you just don't have an organization that stands for the middle class," said Solon Simmons, a sociologist and assistant professor who specializes in American politics at George Mason University's School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution in Virginia. "You've got lobbying groups that stand for various corporations, various interest groups, various business segments, but you don't really have a middle-class organization like workers once had unions.

We're getting just about enough to replace people that are retiring or going out of the workforce. But we have people coming into the workforce, coming out of school, out of training, and we're not going to create enough jobs in this country to get 3.5% growth.

The US government now can collect royalty revenues from oil and gas companies that wish to drill on our extended continental shelf -- the undersea areas beyond 200 miles of our coast. But if we ratify LOST, we'd have to fork over as much as 7 percent of that revenue.

Hardly pocket change.

This time, the Giants look like the better team, though you'd better not tell Coughlin that. It was bad enough that Canty declared, ‘‘Get ready for a parade on Tuesday,'' which is first cousins with a victory guarantee. You can imagine the indigestion it must have caused his tightly wound head coach.
"The camaraderie in the secondary and the interaction between us on and off the field is really good. We should continue to grow together. Last year compared to this year is night and day."

Not so long ago, Price's business would have raised eyebrows among cops. But today, police barely pay attention to the Converse-clad 26-year-old from Arizona. As Oregonians show increasing tolerance for the drug maligned in the cult classic "Reefer Madness," Price is part of a growing class of entrepreneurs moving marijuana through Main Street establishments across Oregon, especially in Multnomah County. That voters have twice rejected ballot initiatives creating a regulated medical marijuana dispensary system hasn't halted the industry's momentum: Federal authorities say they've identified more than 50 new businesses in Oregon suspected of selling marijuana in the past year.
Newsom clearly has tired of the position's obscurity and lack of power. Of late, he has criticized Brown's proposed budget, specifically cuts to education and welfare.

Then I discovered the hotel's most compelling amenity: its Theater District address, down the street from the Broadhurst, where Al Pacino is starring in "The Merchant of Venice," and near such Broadway fixtures as Sardi's, the old New York Times building and Restaurant Row; and 8th Avenue, which, despite gentrification, has clung to its seediness like an old hooker clutching her wig in the wind.

The Fuentes brothers, from San Diego, sure are showoffs — the sort of guys who will cram finger-tapping, shredding, gentle strumming and harmony soloing in the same three-minute song. But that’s exactly what makes Pierce The Veil so much fun. These guys throw so much at the listener, in such a frenzy, that some of it is bound to stick. If you don’t like the way a verse sounds, wait 10 seconds, and you’re sure to get something different. This new album is a 20-car pileup of influences: Maiden-style prog-metal, Timberlake pop, Blackout screamo, Zappa-like pastiche, theater-kid anthems. The Bamboozle crowd didn’t really need its own Mr. Bungle, but now that we’ve got it, we may as well enjoy it.

We will keep fans updated if this changes, so any of you who are interested can swing by if they decide to open it (don't hold your breath). Chip Kelly said he hadn't decided if he was going to close practice for the rest of the season, but I don't think it would come as a shock to anyone if he did.

I'm in my 25th year writing about food and restaurants in San Francisco, and I truly believe this is the best year for openings.

Dereliction of duty or all part of the plan? Obama’s strategy this year — in addition to demonizing whichever Republican gets the nod to challenge him — will be to run against a “do-nothing” Congress, a la Harry Truman in 1948.

New Mexico: This year, New Mexicans mark 100 years of statehood. But much of the state's appeal stems from its human history that goes back much further. (In 2010, Santa Fe celebrated 400 years of cityhood.) Explore here: the adobe architecture and art galleries of Santa Fe; the vintage signage along old Route 66; the lingering hippie vibe of Truth or Consequences. Don't forget the Lightning Field, an art installation outside Quemado where (for $150 to $250 a person) you spend a summer night in a wood cabin and wait to see if lightning will strike one of the 400 tall steel poles outside your door. Even if there's no strike, the sky puts on shows at sunset and sunrise that will leave you in awe.
