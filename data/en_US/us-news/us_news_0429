Walker's protest began when the Air Force kicked him out in 1966 after 25 years of service, mostly in sensitive intelligence operations.

Traditional marriage between a man and a woman should not be redefined just because a splinter group of society wants to change the definition. It is a gross misrepresentation to say that most Americans want gay marriage. You can push public opinion polls any way you want. The institution of marriage should not be manipulated to put the stamp of approval on alternative lifestyles that most Americans do not approve of and undermine traditional family values that have served civilizations well for thousands of years.

Romney seems even more reluctant to talk about his religious faith. Last month, when my Free Press colleague Jeff Gerritt asked him what exposure he's had to people struggling with poverty, Romney's first reflex was to describe the modest apartments he'd lived in as a young man in Paris ("I don't think any of them had refrigerators," he recalled, marveling at his former rusticity.)

What Jones has shown, and what I have tried to convince the great political geniuses in this state, is that a new Vikings roof-covered stadium might be scheduled to hold only 10 Vikings games a year, but having that stadium available for other events sure would benefit both the Vikings and the community.

Washington must ensure U.S.-based innovation and production have the same market access in Asia and the Eurozone that foreign businesses now enjoy in U.S. markets, and that American firms are not disadvantaged by an undervalued yuan or euro.

The spate of suicides -- in a population that traditionally has had lower suicide rates than their civilian counterparts -- has stirred deep concern within the military. Last year, a Defense Department task force called for better suicide-prevention programs, wider use of community expertise in suicide prevention and efforts to destigmatize help-seeking behaviors by U.S. service personnel. The task force also called for more research that could help identify those at greatest risk of attempting suicide and determine how best to help them.

Jones was often the one Purdue chose to leave alone beyond the arc, and that strategy worked as he went just 2 for 10 on 3-pointers. Jones did finish with his 20th double-double of the season, 23 points and 14 rebounds, but the Boilermakers' plan ended up doing just enough to help aid the win.

This makes for the most incredible incompetence at those routine things that you have always taken for granted. The paperhanger takes five days to do a job that a good man would finish in one; the restaurant has its lights so placed that your head casts a shadow on your plate, making it impossible to see your food; a house, well-defigned otherwise, has one corner of the living-room gouged out to let in a trick stairway, the result being that you cannot lay a rug; the salesman has a persuasive line of talk about the merits of the article, and then has to look on the icebox door to find out the price; the telephone clerk reports that somebody called, but hasn't taken his number so you can call back; the waiter clamps a fork over the spoon when he serves peas, in the elegant manner of an Italian serving asparagus, not noticing that when it is peas he is serving, and not asparagus, this makes them bounce all over the table like shot; the bookstore is sorry, sir, but would have to know the publisher before it could order that book for you, apparently not knowing that the United States Index, which is lying open on the counter, was invented specifically to solve this problem; the apartment-house has it drawers built exactly three inches too short to hold a shirt; the movie impresario wires frantically to New York for a certain writer, only to discover that for a year he has had the varlet on his own lot.

The filet mignon ($23) was inexplicably tough and didn't have much flavor, a problem that also marred the halibut in papillotte ($20). The fish is cooked in parchment with zucchini, peppers, olives, slices of Roma tomatoes and a pleasing splash of Pernod, but the dish still didn't rise to the occasion. The classic butter lettuce salad ($8) was overpowered by hot mustard, and the frisee aux lardons ($8.50), despite nice bits of sherry-glazed pancetta, was marred by a poached egg in the center that was practically hard cooked.

Different players will rank these ends in different orders based on their schemes, so we can't be completely sure how they will come off the board.
