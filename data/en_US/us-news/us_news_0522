øFor those difficult resolutions like ridding yourself of bad habits, exercising regularly or eating for health, I use the monthly (short term) system. It works wonderfully well. You resolve to do a particular thing from the first of one month to the end of that same month. A day or two before the upcoming new month, evaluate how things have progressed and if all looks well, keep going for another cycle. Otherwise pitch it. It's a lot easier to deal with a tough situation one month at a time.

The ruling, issued Tuesday, says Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale of St. Louis should only get $2.08 million in legal fees, instead of the $4.36 million awarded by a lower court. Another $471,082 in expenses awarded will stand; the court also ordered MSD to pay $100,000 in plaintiffs' legal fees relative to the appeal.

Revel today also mandated that Lohan abstain from drinking alcohol and that she attend the alcohol education classes once a week, not daily (as Holley offered). Lohan didn't speak at the hearing except to tell the judge she understood the conditions. At one point, when Holley was arguing that Lohan could undergo drug testing in Texas, Revel said she was prepared to outline her reasoning for these conditions if Lohan would not agree to them. At that point, Holley conferred with Lohan, who rolled her eyes and agreed to the conditions.

We often say that property taxes are a bigger problem than income taxes in the Garden State. Not in this case: Four employees of the state Department of Treasury’s Division of Taxation were fired and one resigned as part of an internal investigation of spying on co-workers’ private income tax information.
“I think we’re past that. That’s my belief,” DeBoer said. “You never know. My belief is he got it taken care of and he had the appropriate rest and he’s good to go. It was the first time in probably two or 2 ½ weeks where I really saw his jump back in his legs. It was good to see.”
The fun is just beginning for the Blues. This doesn't decrease their desire to climb back into the semifinal series with the Kings, but they know that even better days are ahead with Ken Hitchcock at the coaching helm.
Why it's hot: You know a bar is jumping when it parks an ATM trailer next to the entrance. That's the case on Fridays at MacDinton's, where party-goers start lining up for "Crazy Happy Hour" at 5:30 p.m. The $10 wristband gets you all?you-can-drink draft beer, house wine and well drinks, Jack Daniels included, from 6 to 8 p.m. Get there early because the wristbands often sell out, signaling the bar has hit its 730-person capacity. And bring cash, because the bar doesn't take credit cards at the door. MacDinton's runs on all cylinders Friday nights, with six bars indoors and on the patio, a live band and valet parking. The crowd thins out once happy hour ends but re-swarms by 9:30 or 10 p.m. for the second shift.

The second round has been to the Broncos what a green-side bunker is to a golfer's approach — hazardous. The Broncos' spectacular second-round whiff under the direction of Josh McDaniels in 2009 — Alphonso Smith (strike one!), Darcel McBath (strike two!) and Richard Quinn (strike three!) — is a major reason Manning's new supporting cast is not as strong as it could be.

Sentencing is set for June. Webster faces anywhere from 10 years to life in prison, up to $4 million in fines, and a mandatory minimum of five years supervised release and $100 special assessment.
A similar scenario played out in 1998 when the state was sued for not providing accurate mental health screening services for children eligible for the Medi-Cal program. In 2001, advocates won their case against the state, and by 2008 the federal court appointed a special master to oversee the program's renovation. Costs soon skyrocketed, and there is little the Legislature can do about it.

"I'm not sure what level of work consumes so much time that he has to be there more than anyone else," said Richard Dadey of Citizens United.
CBS Sports draft expert Rob Rang called a first-round assessment "almost laughable," and said he'd be surprised if Pryor went higher than the fourth round in the supplemental draft, which should be held in July. SI.com draft expert Tony Pauline said he had Pryor graded as a fourth-round pick if he'd been available in April and thinks he'll go no higher than the fifth round in the more uncertain supplemental draft.

So the brutal truth is this: Say what they want, the Cavs are a great regular-season team. But no more. Following them for seven years now and trying to be as truthful as possible along the way, I missed it. I thought it would work in a series, too. But obviously I was wrong with my predictions. So were the Cavs with everything in their planning and preparation.

Whereas previously it was a foregone conclusion that the marriage amendment, defining marriage as only the union of one man and one woman, would get a House vote this year, now that is less clear. Zellers Friday said he didn't know if the measure would get approval in the final three days of this years regular session. He noted it could get a vote next year and the constitutional question would still appear on the 2012 ballot.

Pop Warner football has been around since 1929, and it's quite an institution, but I've always found it a little bit sad, especially as it involves really little kids. Already they're wearing uniforms and knocking heads? I wouldn't mind seeing it eliminated altogether, and I would submit that the sport would continue to thrive. Play touch football, get your chops down, craft a bit of feel for the game, then take that crucial next step at the high-school level. By then, you'll know if you really want it that badly, and unless I'm misjudging the unbridled passion for this sport, I don't think there are enough protective parents to turn football into a wasteland. Too many moms and dads either revere the sport or live their lives through their kids' high-school deeds.

McTeigue directed "V for Vendetta,"and like that picture, "The Raven" is crowded with incident, yet isn't very exciting or fluid as cinema. The works of Poe are naturals for the screen, and their beauty lies in their raw intensity, adaptable for lowdown pulp purposes. The Roger Corman-produced Poe adaptations may not have been faithful to the originals, but they worked their own rough magic. The notion in "The Raven" of Poe chasing after his unwanted protege before he kills again is a good start. But there's no real kick or shiver to the events, nor to the ultimate revelation.
Further action against bounties is seen as part of the NFL's push to increase player safety.
Parents who thought they'd nurtured offspring into independence find 24-year-olds still on the family cell phone bill, still on their insurance plan, still sleeping on their couches. And that assumes Mom hasn't gotten the ax at Sprint or Dad's Raytown home hasn't slipped into foreclosure.
“We’re very excited about what Cleveland offers,” said Erin Lind, Championships Committee chair, in a release. “Not only is it a great city, but the facilities at the Spire Institute are among the best in the nation.

One of the few spikes in 2009 crime was domestic violence, where incidents increased 4 percent. But Karmen said that may not be a realistic barometer because domestic abuse often goes unreported. Better indicators, he said, are statistics on homicide and auto theft, which are almost always reported. Last year 15,501 vehicles were reported stolen, a 23 percent drop.

6. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939): Sure, it has large doses of Frank Capra's sentimental ways, which can seem trite in these modern times. But any dangers of becoming dated are quickly cancelled by the classic performances from James Stewart in the tile role and Claude Rains in evil support. You are cheering by film's end.
The sauce for this dish is red and spicy  how spicy is up to you. If you're looking for a "wow" factor, order it extra hot.

Be forewarned: They may soothe you, but they won't necessarily save you.

But there's more to Salem than witches, of course. The city also has a great maritime history and a prestigious literary past. For centuries Salem was an important seaport. It was also the birthplace of Nathaniel Hawthorne, a descendant of a witch trial judge. Hawthorne lived in Salem most of his life: The House of the Seven Gables, immortalized in his novel of the same name, remains a popular attraction. Author Alexandra Pecci suggests that diners at Nathaniel's restaurant in the historic Hawthorne Hotel try the Scarlet Letter Martini, made of raspberry vodka, Chambord and cranberry juice.

Mr. Krause was born May 27, 1921 in Syracuse, N.Y. to Frank and Helen Krause and grew up in Detroit where his father worked for U.S. Rubber. He earned a bachelor of science degree from the University of Detroit and a master's degree in engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle, serving as engineering professor there from 1947 until 1955, when he joined General Dynamics Convair Division in San Diego. He worked on the Atlas Rocket Program for launching the first Mercury astronauts, such as John Glenn and Alan Shepard during the "space race" years and was also involved in the cruise missile program. "Convair was ramping up a great brain trust of engineers in order to achieve the goal of manned spaceflight, and he was on the forefront of this venture," Bowman said.

Society of Women Engineers Award - Santa Clara County
Unfortunately for the Lakers, they've allowed opponents to crack the 100-point barrier mark in seven of their last 10 games off of these areas. Their pick-and-roll coverage either has shown their vulnerability in playing underneath the screen to allow guards to shoot jumpers, playing over the screen to deny open looks in the lane, and the front-line reacting too slowly on help with both schemes. The Lakers' faster tempo on offense has set them up for failure on transition defense because they don't have the speed to get back in time. They appear jumbled with their rotations both in closing out on the perimeter and giving weakside help inside. Add in inconsistent effort, and the Lakers are in a defensive mess.

The new order came on the eve of a court hearing where Reister's lawyer planned to argue that the bureau's "gross negligence" in the handling of beanbag shotguns and ammunition contributed to Reister's shooting. For example, the bureau has no policy that prohibits officers from mixing lethal and less-lethal ammunition in their duty bags. In the weeks after Reister's shooting, the bureau faced criticism for not having taken immediate steps to prevent a similar mishap.

During a long bench conference that followed, Pettitte was slumped in his seat on the stand, but briefly made contact with Clemens' lead attorney, Rusty Hardin, who loitered near the witness stand wearing headphones in order to hear the bench conference.

You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who wants to make our country less secure. However, many members of Congress would like to see cuts made to our international development budget, which would unquestionably harm the United States' overall security. As an Iraq War veteran — and a civil affairs operator specifically — I have seen for myself how international development keeps all of us safe.

Otherwise, Isaacson is upfront about Jobs' failings. As a young man, Jobs could be recklessly cruel. His parents were both 23 when they had Jobs and gave him up for adoption — an event that vexed and haunted him. But when he and his on-and-off lover, Chrisann Brennan, had their daughter Lisa — also at age 23 — Jobs denied paternity for over a year. He ignored his daughter through most of her childhood. Jobs' explanation — "I could not see myself as a father then, so I didn't face up to it" — seems to be about as self-aware as he ever got.

An offbeat father-and-son story, with 40-ish Ewan McGregor coping with 80-ish Christopher Plummer coming out of the closet. A couple of good performances get lost in a film that meanders back and forth through three separate time periods. (Newark Star-Ledger)
He had a crisis of conscience during the Nixon administration and abandoned his role as the symbol of America and became Nomad, the man without a country. Eventually, he put on the uniform again, deciding that America needed a symbol of freedom.
Anonymous is no more or less far-fetched than Emmerich's prior efforts. But it is much, much more confusing. Its flashbacks have flashbacks. Its characters are shrill and misanthropic. Its hero (a suave Rhys Ifans, resembling Peter O'Toole in his Henry II period of the mid-1960s) is a man of words, not swords, something he reminds the audience multiple times.
Conway used city money to pay for several Caribbean cruises, plane tickets and train trips, as well as a $9,000 delinquent federal tax bill and monthly TV and electric bills for the city-owned house where he lived rent-free.

Luce means light in Italian, and the dining room is awash with sun early in the evening and comes alive with nicely placed lighting as the evening progresses. One fixture is a stunning long luminary that is artfully reminiscent of dried pasta. An open kitchen and hearth oven lets guests watch the culinary team in action, and the eclectic artwork completes the upscale-casual tone. From the antipasti to the butterscotch toffee, the menu is superbly orchestrated.

A few sleeping tips might help: Don't stay awake in bed for more than 20 minutes. Get up and read a book or watch a boring TV show or do anything that relaxes you.

By the end of 1997, Atlanta had been fined almost $20 million for unauthorized sewage discharges into the Chattahoochee River and other waterways, according to one study.

The biggest upset was in the CIC 3-star, which drew the biggest number of marquee names. Tiana Coudray, winner of a 3-star at Jersey Fresh last year with Ringwood Magister, was first with Master Hill after both dressage and cross-country, going so well it was looking as if she would take a 3-star title again. But three fences down in stadium jumping dropped her to second behind Will Faudree, the only rider to go double-clear in show jumping in either of the 3-star sections. His victory on Pawlow was his first individually in an FEI event, though he rode on the U.S. gold medal Pan Am Games team.

Although they come to escape the city, they also bring elements of the city with them. The town's main drag, Joaquin Arcadio Pagaza, is lined with the staples of affluent urban life: coffeehouses serving espresso, fine-art galleries, high-end housewares shops, trendy bars and white tablecloth restaurants. In a town where the tallest building that's not a church is a three-story bookstore, where terra-cotta tiles adorn nearly every roof and ATVs are a common way of getting around, that means that Valle de Bravo is two towns in one -- at once urbane and rustic.

I hope the Pacifica School District and the board members can find funds for each site's School Improvement Programs and find another way to fill the holes in the district budget. I think it's too easy for the Pacifica School District to pass the cost and responsibility onto our PTO's. Paying for and hiring teachers or classified staff is supposed to be the PSD and Principal's responsibility. PTO's are not supposed to be employers. If the PTO's can't cover/loan funds for School Improvement Programs, then our children's education may suffer.

Be sure to check out the stuff on the menu labeled "Memorable Side Dishes" — a wonderland of Taiwanese textural tomfoolery. You've got a great version of rou yuan — a texturally berserk glutinous dumpling object, like a big, greedy Gummi bear that swallowed a meatball and then fell in a sweet-sour soup and drowned happy. You've got tung tzai mi gao, a stack of glutinous rice, regular rice, ground pork and tomato sauce, steamed into warm, melting, porky lusciousness.

His team is building a £400,000 zero-carbon country mansion in Hertfordshire for a client who initially contracted them for a standard home. When they suggested zero-carbon, he was skeptical. "He didn't like the idea of having to pay an extra 10%. But when I showed him how much he would save in the long run, and how much more he could sell it for, he soon agreed." Thermal and energy-efficiency related payback will take four years from occupation for an average home, taking into account new feed in tariffs on eco-homes in the U.K., says Mr. Lipinski. The mansion has a solar thermal heating system that can store up to 100 kilowatt hours of heat, a rainwater harvesting system and a heat recovery ventilation system.

In the early years, though, freedom prompted confusion. Vintners experimented with dull, acidic grapes like Ugni Blanc and Folle Blanche, both of which are better known as base grapes for Cognac than for their potential as wine.

When I became governor, I fought a lot, and maybe I fought too much, and maybe one of the lessons to this whole story is that you gotta be maybe a little bit more humble. You can never have enough humility, and maybe I should have had more of that. But one thing I had a lot of was the desire in my heart to help average, ordinary people, people who didn't have a voice, people like my mother and father who got up every single day and went to work, who worked hard, who sacrificed for their kids, who did without so their kids could have things.
Another potential issue with Findley is salary. Findley's base salary was $73,556 in 2010, but he's expecting a big pay increase in his next deal. The Timbers were leaning against a huge payout to a big-name player, but Findley might be a little more affordable after a disappointing 2010 season. Findley scored five goals and had four assists in 2010, but those numbers represented a sharp decrease compared to Findley's 12 goals while leading Real Salt Lake to the MLS Cup championship in 2009.

The game took a strange twist in the ninth, when Jeff Francoeur hit a long fly that bounced off the top of the fence in left-center. Jackson reached over the wall and caught the ball before it landed in the Kansas City bullpen, saving a home run.

Last season: Texans took major leap forward on defense, going to Wade Phillips' 3-4 alignment. Used six of eight draft picks on defensive players and top two -- end J.J. Watt and outside linebacker Brooks Reed -- locked down starting roles to help Houston win first division title. QB T.J. Yates, a fifth-round pick, was starter by end of year and guided Texans to first playoff victory. He'll start season as Matt Schaub's backup.

Shiloh is a ghostly place, a must for any student of the Civil War. Almost 3,500 soldiers were killed and 16,000 wounded in two days of confused, furious fighting April 6-7, 1862.

FitzGerald said groundwork established in the mediation may still lead to an eventual settlement.
On the original course, the scariest part for me was the initial climb up a staircase made of scaffolding. It was very open-air, and we were not yet tethered to anything, so it was easy for my mind to go to disastrous headlines. Mine was an irrational, but real, fear. The new course has a wider, more secure-looking path up, and that soon will be replaced with a permanent structure.

That's what I did and it worked out for me."

Not sensible, perhaps. The story itself is a pulped fiction, a half-shredded assemblage of genre standbys — World War I dogfights and medieval dragons, gold-hearted whores and old dark homes for “the mentally insane.” (As distinct from, what? The physically insane?)
"It's important for us to remember the history of Lithuanians and Jews goes back 1,000 years," he said. "The Holocaust is part of it. But it's not all the history. These discussions in Lithuania, because of the Cold War that existed afterward, were given a 50-year moratorium."

If they play with the air of entitlement we saw in the opening quarter of Game 1, there could be trouble. That opening stretch is the main reason the Celtics get an all-expenses-paid trip back to Atlanta for a Game 5 next week. Taking the Hawks lightly again will prolong a series the Celts would be wise to end as expeditiously as possible. It could even — those in sneakers need to know — be the cause of an early exit from this postseason party.

Lauren Turelli, a 40-year-old real estate broker from Lake Forest, is no stranger to the political landscape, despite having never won an election. She is known for her negative campaigning style, which tends to be particularly evident in her mailers. She was the 2010 Republican nominee for state representative for the 58th District. She lost to incumbent May. In 2008, Turelli launched an unsuccessful bid to become West Deerfield Township supervisor. She suffered some embarrassment after a widely distributed mailing claimed that Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White had endorsed her, and the endorsement was revealed to be a fabrication.

I used to be on Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett all the time, and people would say, 'He's got a sense of humor.' Then I went to Hollywood and did 'The Gong Show.' I did that stuff because I had a great time. Doing the Ira Gershwin show is not only educational about a great chapter of the Great American Songbook, it's also an enormous pleasure just to hear these songs, let alone sing one."

SLU's magic number to get a first-round bye is 3, and it looks like they won't need any help to get that. Slightly complicating that magic number is that there are five teams with five losses that could still catch SLU, so SLU needs a loss or two from all of them to get this settled. And the practical reality is that if SLU gets 10 wins, that should do it.

We gilded the lily with lobster mac 'n' cheese laden with chunks of claw meat. A splurge night out for sure (figure at least $100 for two; we spent more), but one of the better meals you'll have in the state. Call ahead.

As we talked at Sisters' Place, Miller acknowledged that it wasn't so long ago that he considered preschool "glorified day care." That was before Gabriel was born and before Carolyn scoured the city for early learning opportunities and volunteered with First Steps, an early intervention program.

Each prison inmate costs the state about $47,000 a year. The thinking is that counties could do the job much more cheaply, perhaps as little as $25,000 a year. Transfers would not be immediate. Only those sentenced or eligible for parole after July 1 would be put under a county's watch.

The cynical interpretation of the 2006 Schwarzenegger is that his move to the center is a ploy to get him re-elected in a decidedly blue state.

They ran a Grand Prix through the streets of Charm City recently, and if you looked closely, some people say, those were dollars you saw spewing from the exhausts of those high-performance engines.

Had he traveled half a mile farther north, to North Straight Street, he might have met Malinda Glover, 38, whose possessions were destroyed.

When it comes to Australian wine, the first thing that comes to my mind is shiraz. That's the Australian name for syrah, a red grape that gained its reputation in France's Rhone region. Australia has been so successful in marketing shiraz that many U.S. wineries use that name on their labels instead of the lesser-known 'syrah."

A: Moped bikes are safer than various types of motorcycles, which is basically what a dirt bike falls under. Unless you live in a rural area on a dirt road with very little traffic to the school, the school's goal is probably looking at keeping kids safe.

At each lodge, there were four "rounds" of 15 or 20 minutes. Each round is dedicated to one of the four directions. Between rounds, the lodge's door flap was opened. We were able to leave to cool off and drink more water while more stones were brought inside. We were encouraged to splash our faces with water and rehydrate. More water means more sweat. More sweat means more toxins flushed from the system.
It was after one of our practices, and we played nine holes together, Hamlin said. My agent and his agent know each other really well. Then he came to the race that weekend.

I was in my 4th grade classroom in a small town in South Texas. The fire siren sounded and we knew it wasn't 12 noon when it sounded every day. The school office notified our classroom that Germany had surrendered. As soon as school was finished for the day (maybe they let us out early), we spilled out onto the football field and acted silly as 4th graders might do. I don't remember how the teacher reacted except, as I think back about that day, she had lost her husband in the war and must have had some very personal feelings.

"Our preference all along was to see the dam used as some type of green project," Durbin said. "This is a local asset where there is something in place already to provide clean, renewable power and it's especially important now that Ohio has renewable standards for energy."
Real estate specialists warn that not all desert landowners will enjoy a similar payday, but try telling that to old-timers who hear about deals that have turned farmers into millionaires.

Using the wire nippers, cut a 12-inch-long piece of wire. Thread it through the first hole on the end, leaving a 1-inch tail. Add a small bead on the other end and insert it through the loop on the ring. Bring the wire through the opposite loop; add another bead. You need to tug gently so the beads will be snug. Continue that pattern. Save the larger beads for the center.

Take Jackie Robinson and the color barrier. In 1968, there was a delayed season because Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination rocked the country. In his last speech that June, moments before he was shot, Robert Kennedy gave a shout-out to Don Drysdale (of the L.A. Dodgers) who had just recorded his sixth consecutive shutout. ("Summer of '68" features a photo of Drysdale in his first start after Kennedy's assassination, showing him with a black armband worn in his memory.)

"The idea is that when people come here, they are going to be coming for the day," says Corey Beck, general manager and director of winemaking. "One of the things Francis has always thought was kind of a little bit weird was that when people decide to come to Sonoma County or Napa or wherever and they take a vacation - what do they do with the kids? This is creating an experience for the family. Children can go swimming; they can see a puppet show. Mom and Dad can roll a game of bocce, have a little bit to eat, we're also going to have a children's menu, and then, also, by the way, taste wine as well."

Overview: Jared Sullinger, who missed the Buckeyes' earlier loss to Kansas with back spasms, will be eager to make an immediate impression. But Deshaun Thomas will be just as important for OSU as it seeks ways to move KU's Thomas Robinson and Jeff Withey away from the basket. Aaron Craft is matchup trouble for Kansas' turnover-prone Tyshawn Taylor, so the Jayhawks will seek points in the open floor when possible.
“If you looked at us in the regular season, we are a roller coaster,” Hawks center Al Horford said. “We come out and play great, the other game we get blown out by 50, and so people are saying, ‘Same Hawks again.' And I can understand that.

Every year, business in Latin America's largest country comes to a stop for almost a week and most of its 200 million residents throw themselves so completely into revelry that reports of the proceedings often seem hyperbolic to those who haven't seen them firsthand.

I always thought that at 38 he was too young to retire. A year of resting the left arm - which produced to the tune of 11-3, 3.28 in 2010 - could be a helluva tonic. PED's or not he was always a workout fiend - those type of guys usually pitch well into their 40's. Wouldn't be shocked at all to see him do big things for us in October.

"If our pension system is not reformed, Chicago has two roads to take: We can watch each of our funds go bankrupt ... and be unable to pay the hardworking people who have paid into their retirement funds, or we will be forced to raise property taxes by $1.4 billion per year — triple what we now pay toward pension costs," Emanuel wrote to House Speaker Michael Madigan, Senate President John Cullerton and minority leaders Rep.

Eat in the main dining room or the regular sushi bar and you'll get very good sushi, but to get that "ultimate," you'll have to reserve a seat in the separate sushi bar, a room at the back, where Uechi himself presides and offers omakase (chef's selections) only.

"They have established their case enough to get to a jury, but it has holes in it," said Kieran J. Shanahan, a Raleigh defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. "He is not charged with being a liar and he is not charged with having a baby out of wedlock. He is charged with breaking campaign finance laws."
As a political commodity, the office may be worth considerably less in "Veep," where Meyer checks in regularly with her secretary to see if the president has called, only to be told each time that he has not. If she's desperate for something to do, she's even more desperate for visibility and political viability, something that will ensure her future far beyond the pointlessness of her current job.

The debate centers on whether bail for illegal immigrants held in county jails on indictable offenses can be significantly raised solely because the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has placed detainers on them.

Not that he minded all that much. The enemy in question was Dickie Bennett (Jeremy Davies), and the set-up was that Givens, ineffective again, spent much of his time lobbying to keep Bennett in jail and complaining about his own inability to testify in court. The payoff came after Bennett -- not the sharpest drug-dealing hillbilly in Harlan County -- talked about his time in prison and mehtioned "Abu Graby." With that sly bumpkin act to follow, all Givens had to do was explain why Bennett was a menace to society and should be locked away awhile longer. He couldn't do it. Instead, Givens fell into an angry, frustrated funk and started insulting Bennett and changing his mind on the spot.

As I wrote in February, we know little about Jizhak other than he went to a law school that no longer exists, he has practiced business law about 15 years, his office is in Irvine and he has no record of discipline. Why he decided to run against Chuang is unclear, although I suspect it's because hers happened to be the first name on the list of 37 judges who (technically) were up for re-election.
