"For example, the UAW has said that it pressured GM to change where the company plans to produce a new line of smaller cars," Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Thomas J. Donohue observed in a press statement. "And as part of the GM restructuring, the administration has reportedly closed the U.S. market to Opel and blocked Opel's forays into China so it could not compete with GM - clear examples of market manipulation and protectionism."

But the group's foes feel encouraged by recent events. "I think Planned Parenthood is more vulnerable than it has been in a long time," said Marilyn Musgrave, former congresswoman and vice president of government affairs for the Susan B. Anthony List, a leading anti-abortion group. "They will continue to be the object of a great deal of scrutiny, and I don't think they'll be able to weather that."
The stats for children also differ depending on source. A recent CDC poll of about 9,000 parents and guardians found that 367,000 kids under the age of 18 -- or about 1 in 200 -- are vegetarian. Again, Mangels says the true rates may be higher. A 2005 Vegetarian Resource Group poll of more than 1,200 young people estimated that 3% of 8- to 18-year-olds (about 1.5 million kids) were vegetarian and 1% were vegan.
This allegation raises several questions. On what evidence and on what research procedures does SNAP base this serious charge? Will SNAP publish a written report so that readers can judge the credibility of its statements?

Williams refused to comment for this story, but in a statement sent to The Orange County Register by his attorney, he insisted that “Ms. Larson had no legal priority to act as administrator because she does not personally inherit from the Estate. … Since Ms. Larson did not have legal priority, and there were Estate assets that needed to be properly handled, the Public Administrator was under a legal duty to seek appointment.”

So do we hate AT&T and Verizon? Well, maybe. However, they don't like to produce and deliver the books either. It costs them a fortune. So why do they do it? In 70% of U.S. states they are required to. This is a nutty situation. We don't want them, they don't want to make them and yet they have to and we have to have them. Didn't the founding fathers set up a government of the people? What happened to "We The People"? If 87% of "We The People" don't want these directories and all the wasted resources and costs associated with them, then why do we still get them?
One obvious difference, though, is that this MU team has five seniors in its seven-man rotation. The 1989-90 team typically went eight-deep, with three seniors, one junior, two sophomores and two freshmen.

History has shown that the cost of caring for military veterans peaks decades after a conflict. Already, half of the returning troops have been treated in Veterans Administration medical centers, and more than 600,000 have qualified to receive disability compensation. At this point, the bill for future medical and disability benefits is estimated at $600 billion to $900 billion, but the number will almost surely grow as hundreds of thousands of troops still deployed abroad return home.

Notes: Perry is excited that his daughter, Miranda, will be attending high school in Corvallis for her senior year. “I’ll have a chance to be around her a little bit more,’’ he said. … Perry hasn’t studied much film to learn about the players he will inherit, but noted, “simplicity is what we (taught) in the NFL, getting the guys to play, and play fast.’’ … Perry was part of a memorable Sports Illustrated cover that came out in January, 1980 after Super Bowl XIV. It showed Pittsburgh Steelers’ receiver John Stallworth making a tremendous over-the-shoulder catch just over Perry’s out-stretched hand. The Steelers won that game, 31-19. Perry was inches away from making the play of the game. Instead, he was posterized. “You know what, my son Ryan tells me I should never have jumped,’’ Perry said, laughing. “I have that picture up in our house.’’ … because it happened on such a big stage and made the SI cover, Perry will forever be linked with Stallworth. “Every Super Bowl, I get asked about it,’’ he said. “In fact, I use it as a great teaching tool with the DBs. “Even if you’re in pretty good position, I tell them never jump unless you can make the play. Don’t leave your feet.’’ … what Perry didn’t say was that one of the Rams’ safeties – either Dave Elmendorf or Nolan Cromwell – blew an assignment on that pass. Perry should have had help, but he was left alone. “Don’t know which safety it was,’’ said Perry, “you hate too say (somebody messed up). It was what you call a ‘miscommunication’ and those are words the coaches hate to hear.’’

Said manager Jim Leyland: "When you have a game like today, when a pitcher is pitching like Scherzer, it slows the whole game down to a crawl. I mean, your infielders are standing out there, it is Ball 3, you are walking people, when that happens to any pitcher, that's a nightmare. You like to see the pace of the game go: 'Get 'em in, get 'em out. Have it flow.' You hate to say it, but it can get you bored if you are not careful. ... When that happens to any pitcher, it's a nightmare."
In The Band, lead vocals changed from song to song and within songs, and harmonies were elaborately communal. But particularly when lyrics turned to myths and tall tales of the American South — like "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," "Ophelia" and "Rag Mama Rag" — the lead went to Helm, with his Arkansas twang and a voice that could sound desperate, ornery and amused at the same time.

Select fewer, higher-function, better-built pieces over excess, frills and for-show-only fashion statements. Devote most of your remodeling budget to a few, high-quality materials that won't need replacing for a long time.

That was the only resemblance to that first meeting, however, as this was a wild offensive battle. Both teams moved the ball without difficulty, and the decision wasn't made until the final two minutes, when Ken Konz intercepted a pass by Charley Conerly on the 2-yard line of the Browns.
When he was 15, the family moved to Washington state, where rents were cheaper and jobs more plentiful. His tall, lightly freckled good looks landed him a job as a greeter at an Abercrombie & Fitch store. He moved into a studio apartment and decorated it with a poster of his hero, Michael Jordan. He took two restaurant jobs to pay the bills; work pressures forced him to drop out of Pasco High School a few months short of graduation.
I didn't dance a jig or spike my remote in jubilation. Still, I have to admit to experiencing a small thrill at finally making the leap into my post-cable existence. I have had cable TV in some form for 25 years. Parting is not sweet sorrow.

Hey, Mary Kay: With the two picks in the first round, could you see them taking Blackmon with the fourth and somehow trading up to get Michael Floyd? This would give Colt McCoy two elite receivers to throw to. -- Nick R., Cleveland
Similarly, it insists on a last-in, first-out rule when the city passes out pink slips, as Bloomberg plans to do this year by the thousands. Never mind that some younger teachers, who far outshine some old-timers, would be first out the door. Never mind that fewer teachers would be let go if the state's LIFO law were scrapped. Individual merit counts for nada in the Marxist-inspired union world.

The dizzying décor is a hodgepodge of Western boots, Roy Rogers and wagon train string lights. But what's really mind-warping is the adjacent office building of rooms haphazardly strewn with bolts of 99-cent fabric, 1-cent buttons, nickel zippers and endless racks of jackets, dresses and other apparel priced as low as a buck.
Bunch contends in the motion to hold the divorce in abatement, that Terri Horman "did not borrow the money to pay for Mr. Houze's attorney fees, the money to not come from her funds, and she's not asserting that her attorney fees with Mr. Houze are any sort of marital debt."

You keep reading that the housing market may have reached bottom. We see signs, in general, that the economy is improving. Homebuilders are building new homes. So we think this is the right time to take it to market, both from the strategic standpoint and from the position of where we sit in this cycle. We think we've probably hit the bottom, and investors are looking more opportunistically at the land business.

The Ravens traded out of the first round, giving up their 29th overall pick to the Minnesota Vikings. In return, the Ravens receive the 35th and 98th overall picks.
The German equivalent of "Shakespeare in Love," this glossy, uncomplicated and modestly enjoyable historical romance imagines the real-life love triangle that inspired "Young Werther in Love," the book that made aspiring poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe a literary sensation in the 1770s. As imagined by director and co-writer Phillipp Stözel, young Goethe (Alexander Fehling) is a brash, creative, somewhat scattered lad whose irreverent, carousing ways don't go over well in the backwater town in which he toils as a lowly law clerk. The story indulges in the usual romance tropes once Goethe and his dour but well-connected boss become unwitting competitors for the hand of the same woman. It's a fluffy but agreeable picture, although Fehling hardly evinces Goethe's powerful intellect.

Neal McCluskey of the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute sees a missed opportunity for the GOP to make the case to voters that easy loans entice students to take out bigger loans.

That plan worked fairly well in practice (right down to the early goal), as FCD stymied Sporting on Sunday for 45 minutes. Sporting seemed to accept the snail's pace (made worse by a little post-tackle gamesmanship by Blas Perez and Daniel Hernandez on more than one occasion) dropping off into a very defensive 4-1-4-1 for the first 25 minutes.

Another part of the story here has to do with the character of Santa Monica and indeed of an increasingly crowded Southern California desperate for new models of park design as it tries to make up, slowly, for decades spent gilding its private sphere while neglecting the public one. The immediate context for the parks is a web of surface streets and freeway exit ramps, with some low-rise architecture strung along them. The site is also close to a number of commercial attractions — the Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica Place and the Santa Monica Pier among them — that combine consumerism and pedestrianism with outdoor activity, performing that peculiarly persuasive impersonation of public space that is so common (and so lucrative) here.
"We hope the proper authorities will move forward with their investigation without delay," they said. "We should turn our attention to the victims of these atrocious crimes and ensure they get the help they need. Our hearts and prayers go out to them and their families."

Blink-182's Mark Hoppus has an especially good line about the all-consuming nature of being a pop: "It's like red matter from Star Trek. It just sucks everything in."
McDonald resigned May 12. That was two weeks after being questioned by Ferguson's investigators about the police department's handling of the case involving the death of 21-year-old David Koschman of Mount Prospect after Vanecko punched him in the face during an argument on Division Street in the early-morning hours of April 25, 2004. It was also "days ahead" of the inspector general's summary report to the newly merged department where she worked. Ferguson left little doubt that he believes McDonald jumped to avoid being pushed.
“We exorcised some demons from the Giants from the 2002 postseason game, so I’ll be happy to call Matt because he’s a good friend of mine and he was involved in that play,” Tynes said. “Me and Matt played college ball together, I thought about him today before we played so, you know, we exorcised some demons tonight so that was cool.”
Instead, we get Connally defending the secret meeting as legal because the council members hadn't taken office yet, so they were just private citizens getting together. Even more remarkably, she told Krouse that there could not be a Sunshine Law violation because, "We were not discussing the public's business. Leadership is not the public's business."
The old piece of floss is fully laden with plaque. You wouldn't want to use it again and spread those germs. And be gentle: If you're too rough, you can cut into the gum and cause bleeding or even a soft-tissue wound over time.

David Whitley, FanHouse: "Love or hate Tebow, Ryan needed to tone down the circus he's created. Instead, he's bringing in the biggest elephant in the NFL room. Tebow won't try to be a distraction, but his mere presence guarantees there will be 48 satellite TV trucks permanently parked outside Jets headquarters. The only thing I can figure is Ryan gets a bonus every time the Jets knock the Giants off the back page of the tabloids. He can't be doing this for football reasons. If the coaching staff thought Sanchez's arm was erratic, wait until Tebow throws his first screen pass into the East River."

This is also the first time its been spotted in an Oregon park. Kanaskie said the new site will be treated aggressively. All of the host plants within 300 feet – and possibly farther – will be cut down and burned at the site. The new area will be quarantined to prevent anyone from taking plant material out unless specific disease-prevention protocols are followed. As required by state law, the Cape Sebastian State Park infection site and a three mile buffer zone are now included in the Sudden Oak Death quarantine area.
Newfield and the man who followed her to the stage, Rodney Atkins, suffered sound issues. Both sounded muffled, almost as if they didn't have access to the highs, lows and mids of the speaker set-up. But Atkins got better as his set wore on, especially after he ditched the headset mike and went for a regular hand-held. The sound was cleaner and more powerful, and it was clear he and country fandom are next to the altar.
An undercover investigation in June 2009 identified Reinhardt's computer as one offering to distribute child pornography. An undercover officer downloaded three images and three video files depicting child pornography from the computer. Investigation led authorities to the home Reinhardt shared with his parents in Granite City. In August 2009 while executing a search warrant officers seized two computers containing more than 1,000 images and videos of child pornography. Reinhardt admitted to downloading and possessing the files and sharing those files with other individuals.

"They got me forged papers. They took me right into cafes on occasion, and we often sat at tables next to German officers. I was told it was safe, as long as I didn't talk." Glen laughed at that recollection. So did I. I also marveled, because Glen R. Hufnail was naturally affable -- and talkative. Glen's good nature and combat pilot calmness probably blended him in well in with his Belgian rescuers.
Kasich, a first-term Republican, has tried to distance the injection well process from natural gas drilling and fracking. His administration has emphasized that 176 other injection wells have been operating in Ohio since the mid-1980s without any notable seismic activity.

We wanted Dungeness crab in some form, as well as oysters, because both of these local shellfish symbolize the winter holidays to us. Vegetables could be chosen from winter's brassicas -- Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage -- from winter greens, and from storage vegetables.

He may even be right.
Frequently, Mr. Awlaki has been described as a "terrorist," but how do we know that to actually be the case? We don't. All we have are the Obama administration's unproven assertions since they forbade any and all judicial involvement. That is not how we run our affairs in the United States.

Mason jars also have a long and venerable tradition as impromptu drinking glasses, whether it's moonshine at the Prohibition-era still or soda pop at Fat Maddie's Grille in San Ramon, Calif. Megan Myers, the Austin, Texas, food blogger behind Stetted - 'stet" is a copy-editing term for "never mind, it's OK after all" - mixes up batches of margaritas, using water, frozen limeade, fresh lime juice, tequila and an orange liqueur called Paula's Texas Orange (triple sec will work, too).

"I never would have passed if I hadn't had your class," Jarell continued. "The school isn't the same without you this year."
Mitchell: He's about the same height as Cleare, just a lot wider. Mitchell told me after the game that he played his junior year in high school outside Atlanta at around 285 pounds, that he's down to 265 and that he hopes to be around 245 by the time practice starts in mid-October. Considering what typical freshmen go through adjusting to college life, dropping another 20 pounds might be as hard for Mitchell as Stoglin passing up an open 20-footer. I can see Mitchell becoming a fan favorite at Comcast with his enthusiasm and physical style. More importantly, he showed an ability to put the ball on the floor -- something Maryland forwards haven't been able to do in recent years.

The abuse and neglect of children is a tragedy we should not tolerate. Abuse scars the victim for a lifetime, and children are defenseless against the perpetrator who is often a loved one.

Even as Lucy and the children extract long-dormant humanity from Martin, and he becomes ever more protective, he continues to stalk his prey - an elusive creature with tiger-like stripes and a doggish head. At times, Martin is gone for days as he camps out in the unforgiving woods, setting metal traps and seeking the tiger's den. Apparently the Tasmanian tiger carries some sort of toxin that will be used for some sort of wildly profitable venture. If Martin finds the tiger, he is not to trap it; he is to kill it and then extract organs, and tissue and blood samples.

Off-Ramp had acquired a reputation for an edgy attitude and material that might not suit the audience at the Loretto-Hilton Center in Webster Groves.

China's exports have surged since joining the WTO in 2001, rankling manufacturers in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.

One of the more intriguing moves by the Tony nominating committee was in the category of best original score. Committee members awarded Alan Menken and Jack Feldman a nod for "Newsies" but also Frank Wildhorn and Don Black for "Bonnie & Clyde," a show that closed after only 69 performances. They also nominated the songwriters for "One Man, Two Guvnors" and "Peter and the Starcatcher," although both are really plays with incidental music. Overlooked were "Spider-Man" and "Ghost the Musical."
All of these proposals face long odds of becoming reality unless the state legislature can be convinced to graft them into an already pending education bill.
Roshon seems dispirited, saying that he gives his all every week, but that he's not connecting. Aw, I've grown to like the kid, I want to see him succeed now. So now Roshon goes to Val to learn how to be more masculine - he's giving him some decent advice about body language and facial expressions. They're doing the Argentine tango to a "classical" version of Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance." I don't know if that's terrible or fantastic. Roshon's long, skinny legs look great as always - HELLO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY - I just got about 10 seconds of the logo filling the screen instead of dancing. Roshon gets a pretty great foot flick sequence in near the end. Len says overall it was "clean" and "confident." Bruno says the lifts were "seamless" but he wants to see strength in the legs, because sometimes Roshon's legs get a little wobbly - Bruno, they are but tiny, skinny things, he's doing the best he can. Carrie Ann is so happy she comes around to hug him. He IS kinda adorable, right?

Seeing a whole crowd of fans at an indie/tastemaking-curated event takes the New Orleans rapper by genuine surprise; he lets out a hearty, I-can't-believe-this laugh straight into the microphone. "Boy, look how many of us out here!" It could be the moment Curren$y realized his homegrown movement really has the legs to make him a star. Some would even argue he's already a star, and they'd be right. He performs "Drug Flow," which dropped in 2008 around the height of Spitta's trance stage.

At 10:43 p.m., a 24-year-old man was shot in the 2500 block of West 51st Street in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, police said. The man was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in "stable" condition, police said.

Closer DENNIS ECKERSLEY: Let's be blunt. Whoever holds this position during this exercise is only keeping it warm for Mariano Rivera's retirement.

Eckersley is the pick, but there are a handful of quality closers who would slide in here without many complaints. Other candidates: Lee Smith, Bruce Sutter, Billy Wagner (a 187 career ERA+!), Rollie Fingers. Active candidates: Rivera, Trevor Hoffman.

Izquierdo's sculptures were burnished, thoughtful but sometimes dreamily abstract works. As a whole, their legacy, as well as Izquierdo's, tell us that artistic change happens gradually, and the journey requires patience and toughness. The rewards are self-evident: the point of art is to make it. Izquierdo made and worked steadily while achieving the conventions of success, at least for a Northwest artist, having shown regularly at top tier local galleries like the Fountain Gallery and Laura Russo Gallery in Portland and in most major regional museums.

Chikezie: Paula, amazingly, puts it well: He starts out doing a sort of "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" arrangement of "She's a Woman," which then changes gears into rockin'. And, like they say in the Ron Popeil commercials, it really, really works. Randy thinks "Chekezie smashed it!" Paula quotes her own words of wisdom about taking a risk, and it paying off, though she says, "The reward paid off." That Paula -- if there's such a thing as an abstract talker, she's it. Simon thinks Chikezie was terrific. Ryan then goes nuts, jumping around in celebration of Chikezie's enthusiasm, swabbing the singer's head, and yelling, "You're soaking wet...You got us all fired up now, baby!"

The kick drum starts and doesn’t let up. It’s a club kick that shakes the beer-filled cups of the sports boys waiting for the game to resume. The lights come up as she tears through "Like a Prayer," and we can see that there’s a lean band onstage: a synth player, a guitarist, a bassist, a powerhouse drummer and a pair of backing singers. As her guitarist meets her in the middle of the dance floor, she feints toward "Burning Up," then swerves into "Lucky Star." As in the low-budget clip for the song, she executes a routine with nothing but two male dancers behind her. (They’re dressed in black, as are the musicians; Madonna is the only flash of color.)

A high school-age kid in an Eli Manning jersey then tapped me on the shoulder. “Excuse me sir — would you mind taking a picture of us?” he asked, pointing to his group of friends huddled by the reflection pool. “Sure,” I said as he handed over his iphone. I snapped the photo and took a quick glance at the series of confused half-smiles. It looked like the kids didn’t know how to react — they just knew they wanted to remember.
Which presidential candidate this year has had the most pro-bro policies? I've always considered Obama a bro. You can't be the most powerful man in the world and not be a bro. Rick Santorum was the anti-bro. He was anti the bro lifestyle completely. Herman Cain might have had the bro line of the year: "If you're not successful, look at yourself." It's too bad Chris Christie did not run for president though, because I would consider him the Bro King out of this group.

Each vehicle manufacturer offers a starter car, intended for newly licensed teenagers and other budget-conscious drivers. Their names are familiar, and as supply and demand would dictate, the cars themselves are ubiquitous. Examples include the Ford Fiesta, Chevy Sonic, Chrysler 200 and the Honda Fit. However, the least expensive new car sold in the United States today is the Nissan Versa. The sedan model (the Versa also comes in hatchback) starts at $10,990. Although such determinations are always subjective, it's not hard to argue that the Versa looks considerably more robust than the ballyhooed Smart Car - which costs $1,500 more than the Versa.

While the Republican presidential contest has been raging for more than a year, the Romney campaign concedes that most general election voters haven't yet paid close attention. The campaign now sees an opportunity to reintroduce their candidate to the independents and moderate voters - Hispanics and younger voters, among them - who will ultimately help decide November's general election. His focus will shift to Obama's record, his own economic credentials and what aides call "inspirational themes."

Another strand of logic becomes evident as you examine Calmels' culinary journey. He is the latest in a line of chefs who have come noggin-to-noggin with the reality that there is an impenetrable ceiling at Le Bec.

Think about the before and after. It's a law borne out of some pretty visible messy situations -- lakes and rivers on fire, billions of tons of raw sewage. In many urban areas, you could smell the waterfront before you got to it, and it was a place to keep people away from. (Today,) two-thirds of the waterbodies we assess are meeting the criteria for swimming, meeting the criteria for fishing. It was an ambitious law. It still is today.

After 11 seasons in Milwaukee, where the Bucks made him the 43rd pick of the 2000 draft, Redd signed as a free agent with Phoenix in January. The lockout that delayed the start of the season actually helped his recovery from his second torn ACL suffered on Jan. 10, 2010.
"I think when you look at our club and how things are going, there is no reason we're going to need to go outside (the organization) at this point," Mozeliak said.

Stumbling across underexposed gems is one of the special delights of festival screenings, Easter said. "So many movies, when you see them in the theater, you know what you're seeing already. At the festival, you sit down and you may know nothing about it beyond the title and a brief synopsis. You're taking a chance, having a new experience and maybe discovering something." After grazing the festival for three weeks, he said, he feels exhausted but satiated, like a gourmet following a feast.

No doubt some will argue that Los Angeles' proposal offers kids a free pass. That's simply not true. Police would still have the authority to ticket minors who are intentionally and repeatedly avoiding school or who are involved in illegal activities. What the new rules would do is give those students struggling to remain in school a better chance of succeeding.

Of course, it’s not just the wealthiest people doing what they can to rig campaigns. It’s corporations too. On March 30, “This American Life” devoted an entire episode to how money is currently corrupting politics. “The trouble with this issue -- and I think John [McCain] would agree with this -- is people have gotten so down about it, they think it's always been this way,” says Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) in an interview. “Well, it's never been this way, since 1907. It's never been the case that when you buy toothpaste or detergent or a gallon of gas, that the next day that money can be used on a candidate that you don't believe in. That's brand new. That's never happened since the Tillman Act and the Taft Hartley Act. And so, people have to realize this is a whole new deal. It's not business as usual.”

Those who need to stuff child seats or Costco pallets into their hatchbacks should pass up the 500 for a roomier set of cheap wheels. From Ford to Hyundai, the market has plenty of them.

Those qualities also informed the Bartók, where the call for virtuosity is less personal than communal. In its five sharply delineated movements, the Concerto demands flexibility and responsiveness from the ensemble, and Dutoit again elicited a splendid and vivacious performance.

However, we struck out with main courses. It was a particularly cool night, so I headed for the cassoulet ($24.95), which I can rarely pass up regardless of the season. It was filled with cubes of meat, sausage, confit duck leg and white beans, and topped so thickly with crumbs they soaked up all the moisture, making for a very dry, dusty-tasting dish. The rare cooked tuna ($26.95) was equally unimpressive; the beans underneath were unevenly cooked and the dish would have been too salty even without the green olive tapenade.

Americans have been always suspicious of presidential candidates perceived to hold weak or unorthodox religious values, according to authors Corwin Smidt, Kevin den Dulk, Bryan Froehle, James Penning, Steven Monsma and Douglas Koopman in their new book, "The Disappearing God Gap? Religion in the 2008 Presidential Election.

In Labadie, environmental organization members cite similarities between Venice and Labadie that they say underscore the need for monitoring. The ash ponds at Venice, constructed in the 1950s, are unlined like the leaking pond at Labadie. The Venice ponds sit in the same kind alluvial soil - a fine mix of silt, sand and clay that's an easy pathway for contamination to migrate via water.

Aerial photos of Universal Orlando showed thousands upon thousands of people in line. The park was admitting guests to the 20-acre Wizarding World area in waves, so it did not appear overcrowded from the inside.

The first issue is a transmission that's a bit of a mess. The clutch pedal has a nice response to it, but the shifter is too notchy and imprecise. It's just not a fun car to shift and has none of the satisfying "nailed it" feeling other shifters (even in less-powerful cars) can have.

In 2008, both Obama and Republican nominee John McCain used such joint committees to raise funds for their presidential efforts. But this year, the Democratic party and Obama's reelection effort are drawing more large donations.
The focus on likability is a mistake. It's a mistake, first, for Democrats if they believe likability will be enough for Mr. Obama to win re-election come November. It's even more of a mistake for those Republicans who believe that the only way to defeat the president is to get fellow Americans to dislike him as much as they do.

If DeCastro truly is a "plug-and-play" player, he could have fortified the Bears' offensive line, which has a chance to take a quantum leap this season with a healthy Jay Cutler and Pro Bowl wide receiver Brandon Marshall. And you can argue that if the Bears' offense improves significantly in 2012, the defense can live with Israel Idonije's five sacks. They were doing fine with that last season until Cutler was injured.

There are some variations that would include lefty Jaime Garcia because of his multi-year contract and the commitment that the Cardinals have made to him before his 25th birthday. There are some that would include Schumaker because of his history with the team and his role in the clubhouse. The people's pick would undoubtedly be David Freese, the Crowned Prince of St. Louis. A survey of the Cardinals' roster shows who has the contract to back their place in the core. To show how long the Cardinals expect individual players to be around (and, thus, to be an integral part of the team's Post Pujols Era), here is the roster re-sorted by the final year of each player's contract:

But interviews with more than a dozen friends, relatives, former colleagues and neighbors paint a complex and contradictory picture of a woman with immense personal charm who can be both supportive and self-centered. Sometimes giving, sometimes demanding, she has a few close friends who have stood by her while she's been vilified in blogs. She has a bachelor's and a master's degree in education but has never held a full-time teaching job. Colleagues say she was a dedicated teacher yet during the past year she cracked down on Kyron when he had a bad day at school.

Some of the criticism is warranted. This is not some blanket love fest for Holland and Babcock. Hollands draft record for the past few years has been pretty empty. The last star to come to Detroit via the draft was Franzen in 2004. Since then, weve had promising players such as Darren Helm and Gustav Nyquist and prospects that warrant excitement such as Brendan Smith and Riley Sheahan. But no studs. No stars. Not yet. The excuse is obvious. First, the Wings are always one of the top teams in the league, so they draft spot late in the first round. And second, Holland has been more than willing to part with No. 1 picks to acquire help at the trade deadline. Both valid points. But both lose a little steam when you consider that Pavel Datsyuk was taken in the sixth round (1998), and Henrik Zetterberg was taken in the seventh round (1999). Its still possible to find stars in later rounds. Holland just hasnt done it in a long time.

Expected role if lockout ends: It all depends on his health. He had microfracture surgery on his left knee on November 19, 2010, and the Blazers said he would miss "six to 12 months." Oden said last week on his Facebook page that he recently started to run, but his rehabilitation status is unclear. If he's healthy and can replicate the dominant potential he flashed before his second knee injury two seasons ago, he could be a difference-making starting center. But after three knee surgeries, expectations are at an all-time low for the one-time franchise player.

Supporters of Munger's plan argue that it's the more honest of the two initiatives. In her proposal, all of the revenue sent to schools would be in addition to the amounts they're guaranteed from the general fund.

Several years ago, bird lovers started tracking the number of dead birds found around tall buildings -- including here in Cleveland. Harvey Webster, who is director of the Wildlife Resource Center at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, said that most people have no idea that tens of thousands of birds die in Cleveland each year because of night lighting. In 2005, for example, nearly 700 dead birds were found near the Terminal Tower alone.
Carson and the medium of TV grew up together. In the early years, many TV shows and stars were recycled from radio, including two of Carson's idols, Jack Benny and Red Skelton. NBC created "The Tonight Show" in 1953, first hiring Steve Allen as the host and then the mercurial, more cerebral Jack Paar. When Paar quit in 1962, the network eventually turned to the young host of the game show "Who Do You Trust?" to take over. Carson's name later became part of the title of the show he hosted until 1992.
