I never met the man. In a quirky, tragic bit of irony, he dropped dead from a heart attack or some other physical anomaly when I was only a baby.

His vocals can bring to mind the expressive growl of Louis Armstrong. His guitar work sounds steeped in the colors of Piedmont blues. And the recordings — most of which he produced himself, up until his most recent one, A Wasteland Companion — sound like ghostly transmissions from some nostalgic alternate honky-tonk universe. He's covered tunes by the underappreciated outsider songwriter/singer Daniel Johnston. He's done Beach Boys tunes. He's recorded a haunting version of J.S. Bach's "Prelude and Fugue in C Major." He can veer from songs that would be equally at home on Tom Waits or Carter Family records. He's probably best known for his collaborations with the actress Zooey Deschanel. (They record under the name She and Him.) He's also recorded with the Monsters of Folk, which includes Jim James of My Morning Jacket and Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes. Point is, he's all over the map, and yet it's all somehow filtered through his expansive sensibility. But of all the artists that M.

Tell your sister to try to understand that he wants to show his "manly" side so he can be perceived as one of the more cool and independent guys, most likely to win approval from his friends.

IBM's "power wasn't recognizable before then," Spencer told Computerworld magazine in 1986.

Her choices at the beauty parlor may be reliably outrageous; in the studio, she sticks to time-tested sounds and beats that won’t trouble program directors at corporate radio stations. Because she understands showbiz and the need to make a splash, she makes sure that every safe choice she makes comes wrapped in an outrageous package. This confuses people. We tend to think of her as a groundbreaker, or an iconoclast, rather than the solid traditionalist she is.

Despite my mother's strong preference that I grow up to become a writer, she couldn't ignore the fact that whenever we went to OMSI, I was strongly drawn to the electronics section. When I was 6 years old, Barb Dudman offered to teach me Logo on the Apple III. Logo is a programming language that uses commands to move a turtle cursor around the screen, a deceptively simple concept that can generate amazing graphics. After one lesson with Barb, I was hooked. At home, I wrote a long program that drew a complicated picture; as I recall, it was an American flag. At the next lesson, I typed in the program -- and lo and behold, the turtle drew the flag for me in beautiful green-on-black monochrome. What power! My programming skills improved over time, and soon Barb was teaching me Pascal. By then there was a true reward for doing well in the lesson: I would get to play "One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird" with Joe on their Mac.

The city has spent the past few months grappling with a $35 million deficit in the coming year's budget. And the city saw its bond rating slide as it drew on reserves, in part, to cover payments to the NHL. The city paid $25 million to the NHL in an arena-management fee that covered arena and team losses last year. The city pledged another $25 million for this season.

This holiday dessert is a variation on the English plum pudding. Hard sauce is the traditional accompaniment but I find it way too rich. Whipped cream will do nicely, or some eggnog or vanilla ice cream. I steam the puddings in foil pans and wrap them in foil for easy reheating. They can be refrigerated for up to a week and then re-steamed. They also may also be frozen.

Our first visit began with two nearly all-plant courses. The daily eggplant special featured thinly sliced discs of the vegetable, coated with bread crumbs, topped with fresh ricotta cheese and basil and served in a bath of fresh tomato marinara. Yes, the eggplant was fried, but it was crisp and nongreasy. The marinara was the essence of beautifully fresh, ripe tomatoes -- very little garlic or herbs, just a concentrated, sweet, simple condiment.
"For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action," Giffords said in an interview with MSNBC.

Until now, few Haitians have known about this buried treasure. Mining camps are unmarked, and the work is being done miles up dirt roads near remote villages, on the opposite side of the country from the capital.

Actual mining could be under way in five years.

"I take a risk" every day, says Kelly Rudnicki of sending her 9-year-old son, John, to school. He is allergic to dairy, peanuts, tree nuts and legumes. When John started preschool, Ms. Rudnicki says she got "deer-in-headlights looks" from other parents and teachers because her son was the only child with allergies.

John's fourth-grade class in a suburb of Chicago recently invited Ms. Rudnicki to consult with the planning committee for a spring fair to help select refreshments that won't trigger John's allergies.

This is a question that we routinely advise our financial-planning clients about. The debtor must consider his or her marginal tax bracket and how much of the mortgage interest is actually deductible above the standard deduction amount. A simple example: A couple in the 25% tax bracket has $20,000 worth of deductible expenses, including $5,000 of 6% mortgage interest. The couple is deciding whether to prepay the mortgage or invest the money in a Roth IRA or Roth 401K. They're actually only paying 4.5%, after tax on their mortgage. Assuming they could get 7% by investing in the Roth account, the decision is easy -- make minimum payments on the mortgage and invest the additional principal payments in the Roth. However, if the couple only had $8,000 worth of deductible expenses, with an 8.5% home-equity line of credit (in which case the loan was actually costing them 8.5% after taxes), and they already had funded their Roth IRAs fully, then they should prepay the mortgage.

Depending on the exact free agency rules, Fells is either a restricted or unrestricted free agent. (The Rams tendered him as a restricted free agent at the beginning of March, before the lockout.) Last year, when McDaniels was head coach in Denver, the Broncos expressed at least some interest in signing Fells as a restricted free agent according to league sources. But whether Fells, Bajema or Onobun is odd man out in St. Louis remains to be seen.

Nearly two-thirds of her donors gave $100 or less, her campaign said when releasing a summary sheet last week.

His semi-nemesis is played by Bridges, the beloved White Russian-swilling Dude of "The Big Lebowski," and they are led by Favreau (writer of "Swingers," director of "Made," co-star of "Very Bad Things").

Christie, who wants the Legislature to join him in his effort to keep annual tax hikes to no more than 2.5 percent, also offered a surprise compromise.

Christie had been emphatic that he would accept only a constitutional amendment and would not go along with the 2.9 percent cap passed by the Legislature this week.

As for the university, I don’t think you should tell them. I mean, what he did really isn’t illegal — it’s just morally wrong and a bit icky. I also wouldn’t go threatening him so he could be your errand boy. It’ll open up a can of worms. You don’t want him to see it as a reason to continue taking advantage of your couch “You, Me and Dupree”-style. Leave this situation for the movies.

We are not naïve about the existence of forces in the world which work against peace and against human security, but it is our fervent wish that we shall never become like those whom we condemn as lawless and without scruples. For it is our duty as members of a democratic society to provide leadership by example, to not only articulate the highest standards but to walk down the path to peace and justice with those standards as our constant companions. Our moral leadership in the world depends chiefly upon the might and light of truth and not shock and awe, and ghastly glow of our 2,000 lb bombs.

Much like Someone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin, Oh No Oh My are earnest Midwestern kids with an affinity for Belle and Sebastian, the Shins and all things twinkly. SSLYBY was always greeted with a been-there-done-that shrug, and Oh No Oh My is probably cruising toward a similar critical assessment. There are a few reasons why “People Problems” demands more than just cursory engagement from the argyle-socks brigade: For starters, almost all the songs incorporate lavish, imaginative string arrangements. Principal songwriter Greg Barkley has stepped up his game, too, writing sharper melodies than those you’ll find on the band’s prior releases. But the real reason to tune in is the weird, unlikely thematic tenor of this record. Although they’re rarely blunt about it — the violent “So I Took You” is a notable exception — Oh No Oh My can’t stop alluding to crime. “Not the One” opens with a discussion of a police report. Then there’s the five-minute ballad “Should Not Have Come to This,” on which Barkley’s guilt-soaked voice speaks volumes. The result: a surprisingly spooky album by a twee-pop band that should have been capable of nothing of the sort.

The differences in the older cities to the north and younger cities to the south can be seen in Laguna Niguel and Anaheim.

Set in a 1930s expat Paris embodied in cleverly manipulated giant sepia-tinted postcard images, Krymov's "Paris," adapted from a short story by Ivan Bunin, is a moody, wryly comic blend of engaging visuals, enchanting found-object music and a romance that generates little heat. Or interest. And that unfolds very slowly. But it rewards some concentrated attention beyond its significance as an event.
Crystal will already have the audience on his side, having come to the rescue in the wake of the Brett Ratner fiasco. In case you've forgotten, Ratner, the hacky director of the "Rush Hour" movies, had been tapped to produce the 2012 Oscar ceremony.

The four actors imbue these characters with a frank, down-to-earth style that makes them seem like people you might have met, even if they are talking to angels, characters from history or figments of their imagination (all of whom show up). Stray Dog is a small theater in a small venue, where nobody looks too glamorous or refined. But their ordinariness makes their dramatic circumstances at once more plausible and more exceptional. Rooted in traditions of spiritual seeking, Kushner's work celebrates the precious essence of life itself. You need ordinary lives, not extraordinary ones, to prove you mean that.

But the smooth and delectable rum, made with island-grown cane sugar and water from the island's famous Mount Wai'ale'ale, was worth the wait. It's distilled in Kalaheo in the Kukui Brand jam and jelly factory, which the company also acquired. That means you can make a truly local mai tai, using Kukui Brand mixer and Koloa Gold and Dark rums, which they'll show you how to do in the tasting room at the Kilohana Plantation in Lihue. The tasting room may be visited only once a day (you must provide your driver's license as proof), and the door is locked during the tasting sessions, presumably to stop minors from wandering in (or could it be to stop the delicious rums from wandering out?)

His tile collection for Lea is called "Goccia," Italian for drop. The tiles — in smooth anthracite black or sleekest white — create an undulating impression along a wall.

I appreciate the concept of leap years and would never abolish them. However, I disagree with Julius Caesar and Pope Gregory XIII on one important point: They should never have put Feb. 29 on the calendar.

It is important to note that the Werdesheims' activities are not reflective of Shomrim's role in the community. The organization has fielded thousands of calls without incident, and it has received numerous awards for its efforts from local and state law enforcement officials. Only one of the brothers, Eliyahu, was a Shomrim member, and he was suspended immediately after his encounter with Mr. Ausby. He is no longer a member of the group. Despite some calls for it to be disbanded immediately following the confrontation between the Werdesheims and Mr. Ausby, Shomrim has quietly gone about its business. The whole group should not be tainted by one former member's poor judgment.

“He felt a little bit betrayed,” Banderas admits. “A little bit. I went to his house because I wanted to tell him face to face. I told him, ‘This is an opportunity to go to Hollywood — at least one day I can tell my grandchildren, I did a film for Warner Brothers!’ And finally he said, ‘Okay, okay.’ And then he slowly took a picture of me and him down from the wall and he wrote on it ‘The Mambo Kings play very, very sad songs — Pedro’ and handed it to me. I mean, you could almost hear him playing the violins, you know?”

Was there any real surprise that Ginny Jaquith was appointed to fill the vacated seat on the Pacifica City Council? Actually, you could have filled in a one of half dozen other names and it would have been no less a surprise. To be honest, Ms. Jaquith is likely an excellent choice considering her past experience. Perhaps I would have voted for her had I been given the chance but therein lays the issue I have with her appointment: I did not have the chance to choose her and neither did any other electorate in Pacifica. The Democratic process was hijacked by the city council and my choice was taken from me.

It is even possible, under this scenario, for the Republican campaign to go all the way to the convention floor, for the first time since 1976. In Kansas City that August, President Gerald Ford held off a determined challenge from the forces of former California Gov.

Experts say such borrowing is increasingly attractive to lawmakers because they don’t require large upfront expenditures and are easily forgotten as the state pays off the debt over two decades. They say it’s harder to criticize borrowing for college buildings or economic development projects than the small local grants. And the projects are added behind closed doors by legislative leaders and get little public debate. They often appear one day and are voted on the next.

The great pleasure of this work - and perhaps of any autobiographical writing - is the opportunity to peek under the hood. Reading Sontag's casual journal entries is the closest any of us will get to being inside her brain. And oh, what a brain it was! The subject of the diary is exactly what its ponderously Sontagian title indicates, "consciousness harnessed to flesh." Sontag puts it more simply: "There is no one right way to experience what I've written. I write - and talk - in order to find out what I think." Entries range from anguished heartache over love affairs to notes about books she was reading (or intended to), and fleeting observations about this and that thinker, artist, exemplar.
Susan Sontag is having a great afterlife. Not a day goes by without a reference or two; her name can be found so often in the Sunday New York Times that a writer friend jokes about playing "Sontag bingo." Since her death in 2004, there has been a steady stream of books by and about her: memoirs, analytical volumes, a posthumous collection of essays and speeches, and two volumes of her journals and notebooks, both edited by her son, David Rieff. Together, the recent releases constitute a moveable feast for Sontag fans, and a collective effort to re-examine a life filled with contradictions and complexities.
Brooks, 43, headed the company before resigning in disgrace in July after it emerged that one of its publications, the weekly News of the World, had illegally accessed the voicemail messages on the cellphone of a kidnapped teenager who was later found slain in 2002.

For the salad: Toast the garlic in a small skillet with a little oil. The garlic can be made ahead. Just before serving, toss all the salad ingredients together with just enough vinaigrette to lightly coat.
"He just said, 'I want to do this,'" Martindale said Friday afternoon during a phone interview from Anchorage, where he waited for Gilman's body to arrive. "His mom was not happy about him going fishing. I had some concerns, but I thought it would be an adventure."
Off the field it was a different story, though.
Perhaps the most troublesome part of the round occurred when he was 108 yards away on the first hole and wound up with a bogey. His wedge came up short and with spin, catching the slope and rolling off the green, and he took three putts from there. After his lone birdie on a par 5 at No. 2, he went long of the green going after a back pin and was left a difficult up-and-down. Another bogey.

McLaughlin stops short of being convinced that standing desks lower health care costs or decrease absenteeism, as some people have suggested. "But what I do think is that it raises employee morale," he says. "I think it gives people more of a feeling of control over what they're doing, and their health."
Some industry analysts have theorized that because of its clandestine nature, the X-37B could be a precursor to an orbiting weapon, capable of dropping bombs or disabling foreign satellites as it circles the globe.

The real horror, Hill seems to suggest, is in the unadorned truth that usually goes unspoken. And although a devil's-eye view onto the world shows Ig the world at its worst, it also gives him the opportunity to peer more deeply into the mystery of Merrin's death.
The easiest, most efficient way to lower tax rates and streamline the tax system would be to eliminate "tax expenditures," the deductions and exclusions that shelter big chunks of income from taxation. That would make your tax return much simpler and bring in billions of dollars of new revenue.

The other underscores the tense relations the Vatican's financial institutions have with the Bank of Italy and Italian prosecutors.
