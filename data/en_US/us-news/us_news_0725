Melandri Lambrusco, Emilia-Romagna, Italy ($6-$7, 8 percent alcohol): Lambrusco is both a grape and wine. It's one of the oldest and most storied grapes in Italy, cultivated prior to the Romans by the Etruscans. The wine was made famous (or infamous) by the Banfi family in the '70s and '80s with the introduction of Riunite. It's also one of the all-time great summer wines. This one is a little thin, but it's still good. The color has grape and dark cherry tones. There is slight fizz, which is normal and attractive. The aroma has some grippy charred cherry. The taste is tart, light and simple. This is a great pool red and a fine choice as a base for Sangria. 82 points.

The details: Even within the already esoteric hierarchy of brandy, Calvados occupies a low rung, perhaps because its base material is apples, not grapes. But it has its loyalists, none more than San Francisco importer Charles Neal. So if Neal's "Calvados: The Spirit of Normandy" ($60, Flame Grape Press, 766 pages) lacks the polish of a high-concept work, it has an impressive decade of scholarship behind it - from profiles on nearly every notable producer to the impact of mistletoe on apple trees. Neal includes a mountain of detail, making this an essential reference on an underappreciated topic.

Chris Burke, SI.com: "Manning is not the first superstar player to switch teams in the twilight of his career and he certainly won't be the last, but the shock of such a drastic change never quite wears off. Assuming Manning suits up for a different NFL franchise in 2012, he'll join the likes of Joe Montana, Emmitt Smith, Jerry Rice and Joe Namath, among others, who spent their final seasons with franchises other than the ones with which they built their careers. All of those moves were met with varying degrees of success. However, it's worth noting that Manning still played at an extremely high level in 2010 - he threw for 4,700 yards and led the league in completions (450) and passing attempts (679), while guiding the Colts to their ninth consecutive playoff appearance. If Manning's new team get anywhere near that quality of play, then the Colts' decision to send Peyton packing could have a major hand in how the 2012 NFL season unravels."

“We know that Portland is a talented team and if we’re going to have success, we’re going to have to work hard for 60 minutes,” Charron said. “If you look at tonight, their top players were able to seal the game for them as they had throughout the first series. And with us, our key guys didn’t produce the way we needed them to.”

The basic sort of message, though I hate to say it because it feels nauseating to say, “Follow your dreams,” but it kind of is. We never grew up with dreams in my environment because they would lambaste you if you mentioned dreams. It’s just about how you practice as hard as you can and, if opportunity comes around, then great. If not, that’s life.

No, Harriman says. On most airlines' websites, those kinds of purchases don't come with guarantees. Here's what American says about its awards flight upgrade: "You will have a confirmed seat, as long as award seats are still available for the award you are using when you make your reservation. However, all accommodations are subject to availability at the time reservations are made." Which means they can take them away whenever they wish.
"The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) offers its condolences to the family and loved ones of Trayvon Martin in their time of need. The NBPA is saddened and horrified by the tragic murder of Mr. Martin and joins in the chorus of calls from across the nation for the prompt arrest of George Zimmerman. The reported facts surrounding Mr. Zimmerman's actions indicate a callous disregard for Mr. Martin's young life and necessitate that he stand trial. The NBPA also calls for the permanent resignation of Sanford Chief of Police Bill Lee and a full review of the Sanford Police Department, for dereliction of duty and racial bias in this matter and others. Their silence in the face of this injustice is reprehensible and they cannot be trusted to safeguard the citizens of the Sanford community equally."

Update on The Pacificans For Recall. The Notices Of Intent To Recall Sue Digre and Pete DeJarnatt have been sent out on March 8. This recall has been long overdue, but if we want to save what's left of this city we must take a stand now, not just a few people that contributed to the cause financially and other ways. We all have to participate this time. We have a specific calender to follow, so if all goes well with the signatures we collected by the city clerk and the elections office I'm looking at a timeline of March 29, so I'm asking for all the community's help with the petitions. I have established an account with First National Bank. I put the seed money in and thanks to some very generous donors who have acknowledged with a thank you, we are now asking, you the residents of this city to participate by not only signing the petiiton but gather names for us, the proponents. We needed 20 signatures and we got well over that for the Notice of Intent. Now we need at least 4,000 by August.
The slapstick is mild-mannered; there's no romance, not a hint of emotion. Director Tim Hill (he helmed the first "Chipmunks" movie, shockingly) is all wrapped up in the "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" scenes -- the egg-shaped Easter Bunny sleigh (pulled by chicks) and making sure the rabbit looks at home behind a drum kit. When E.B. jams with the Blind Boys of Alabama, you will believe a rabbit can keep a beat.

Police corruption and dirty DUIs
A native of Detroit, Dick and her husband landed in the Chicago area in the 1970s for work, and "moved in cold," she said, looking for a neighborhood that had "young families, with Big Wheels in the driveways and stuff." Naperville was a town of 14,000 at that time and, from what Dick recalls, was very transient: the average stay was about 18 months. "There was a lot of community among people who'd moved in who didn't have family here," Dick said. "That was the draw, along with a great park district, great schools, and so forth."
"Trenton needed something like this, some place where residents can come even on a Saturday and instead of having to go out of town, as we most often do, they could get good quality stuff right here," she said.

What is surprising, then, is the relaxed, retro feel and sound that Orton and O'Rourke came up with for Comfort of Strangers. While acoustic guitar has been the constant cornerstone of Orton's aesthetic -- as her B-sides, including "Safety," "Pedestal" and "It's Not the Spotlight" (all available on the double-disc retrospective Pass in Time), often revealed with their stripped-down formats -- Orton seemed addicted to the perfection promised by studio technology and multitracking.

Overnight, Merkur became a walking cautionary tale. For Merkur kept an Excel spreadsheet of the dozen women he’d met on Match.com or who were recommended by pals, callously rating the ladies by appearance and personality. But mainly appearance.
While those arguments have some merit, Szalay and supervisors who voted for the deal  Roberta MacGlashan, Susan Peters, Don Nottoli and Jimmie Yee  utterly ignored the potential risks to the county. In particular, the deal, as now written, allows Ose to invest whatever amount of money he wants in profit-making businesses  ranging from a pet motel to an RV park. If the county wanted to end the agreement before 10 years, it would have to repay Ose for his investment costs and percentage of lost revenue. That could add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and possibly more.
OptiGrate will nearly double its space when it moves into the new, 10,000-square-foot facility in Oviedo. Its expansion, Glebov said, is driven by growing sales of its tiny electro-optic components, used in everything from military communications gear to medical equipment.

The speed at which Valor has gone from start-up to domination stuns even veteran prep observers. On May 20, 2009, the Valor girls soccer team — in its first varsity season — played in the 4A state title game, with at least nine eventual college soccer players taking the field that day for Valor, which lost to Wheat Ridge 2-1.
This is the strange part about the outrage over Reyes’ decision to take himself out of today’s season finale after his first-inning bunt single: This is not the first time a player has done this. This will not be the last time, either. Reyes didn’t break any unwritten rules here — he probably would have played only a couple innings today anyway.
In an increasingly Darwinian economy, Barracuda Networks, Campbell-based maker of spam and spyware filters, has used its profits recently to make acquisitions "to add technology muscle."

Ship's Capt. Trygve Vorren, a single himself, visited us twice in our lounge. "I like this," he said. Another frequent visitor was fleet hotel director Klaus Lugmaier, who seemed to be everywhere at once, taking notes about malfunctioning TVs or safes, seeing that they were fixed, using his influence to book group dinner reservations for us when we couldn't get them. He arranged for us to have dinner on the house one night at an alternative restaurant.

The Big 12, including Texas A&M, agreed to a 13-year television deal with Fox Sports in April worth more than $1 billion. There is a chance the contract could be voided if the Aggies leave the conference, which could lead to legal issues for Texas A&M and its new league.
Coppinger's story reached national attention last week when Anderson Cooper talked about it on CNN's "Ridiculist." During the City Council's Nov. 15, Mayor Sally Faith read a statement in which she said the other 61 applicants for roles in Christmas Traditions followed the hiring rules to the letter and were hired. Faith said that given Coppinger's "excessively inappropriate behavior and language at the drug testing facility and actions following this process, the city made the right decision in not rehiring this former cast member."

Not all delay has to be announced. The Environmental Protection Agency said in 2010 it planned regulations to cover coal ash; since then not a peep. Will it classify ash as hazardous waste, unnecessarily adding to utility costs? If we were forced to bet, we’d bet yes.
Four days later, corrections officers picked Anderson up and drove her to the prison infirmary to finish her antibiotics. There, Anderson's symptoms worsened. The tips of her fingers swelled like the pads of a tree frog's toes -- a telltale sign of chronic endocarditis.

Since the start of the 2009 season, Rice has not missed a game, emerging as the Ravens' most reliable and productive offensive players. He has topped the 1,200-yards rushing mark three years in a row and caught 217 passes during that stretch, as well.
When you get into (offseason practice), (Baldwin) has to develop, Breaston said. He's raw but he's athletic and he can make plays, and that's why he's here.

“Our first and foremost goal is trying to reduce the tax impact,” Sargent told committee members earlier in April.
"I thought it was a gutsy effort by us," DeBoer said. "I thought we deserved the win. We came out and played real solid. The game got away from us a little in the second period. We got a little sloppy and Florida is a real opportunistic team. But I thought we deserved the win and we got it. All it does is it gives us an opportunity for one game for us to keep moving forward here."
Koreans are very proud of faring well on standardized tests, and government policy since the 1960s has been to promote education as a means of lifting the country to affluence. But there's a long-running conflict in Korean culture, which promotes itself as classless yet clings fiercely to a hierarchical tradition. People see education as the only way to break through the hierarchy and move up the ranks of status. So actions that unfairly separate moneyed people from the pack are strongly criticized.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been making a concerted effort to reach out to the right. Although he has been noting his recent conversion to Catholicism, he's hampered by two divorces and an adulterous history. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney must explain his change of heart over the years on positions on guns, gay rights and abortion; health care also is a problem for him. Minnesota's ex-governor, Tim Pawlenty, has had to apologize for backing climate change legislation. Donald Trump? Highly unlikely.

More recently, the late pope attempted to calm religious tensions after Mubarak's downfall, which sparked a surge of persecution against Christians, including an attack by soldiers and thugs that left at least 27 people dead at a Coptic protest in October.

Ms. Nissenbaum, author of the book "Privacy in Context," has called for the development of what she calls digital "fences" around data usage. She argues that rules for data use should be based on context.

I've no idea where President Barack Obama gets his shirts and smokes, but he certainly talks like a highbrow, sufficiently so to persuade presidential historian Michael Beschloss to pronounce him the day after the 2008 election "the smartest president ever." Yet, in the end, he plays Chicago style. You can take the community organizer out of Chicago, but you can't take the Chicago out of the community organizer. Or as the Agence France-Presse headline put it, "Combative Obama Warns Supreme Court On Health Law."
Flake's stark shift to a harder line is reminiscent of the right turn that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another one-time champion of immigration reform, took while campaigning for president in 2008 and for re-election to the Senate in 2010. As with McCain, Flake's moderate record on immigration is widely seen as a political liability in an Arizona GOP primary. Many Republican voters and conservative "tea party" activists strongly oppose any proposals they suspect could lead to what they decry as "amnesty" for illegal immigrants. Flake is the only Republican to announce his Senate candidacy.

Clark's death at age 82 was a sad communal moment for most of us in the nonshowbiz world -- many remembered him from hosting "American Bandstand" and ushering in the New Year, every year, for what seemed like forever -- he was Father Time and Baby New Year wrapped into one age-defying package. But for Gloria Poole, now 56 and living in San Ramon (Gary Poole passed away in 1989), it was far more personal.

Brewer, meanwhile, has been a foe of the administration's immigration policy. The Justice Department filed suit against Arizona to stop the state's controversial illegal immigration law Brewer championed -- which requires all immigrants to carry documentation and allows police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without a warrant, among other provisions -- from being enforced. Brewer filed a countersuit earlier this year in response, saying the federal government has failed to protect her state from an "invasion" by illegal immigrants. Last week, a court refused to lift a stay on the law, and the Justice Department responded by asking a judge to dismiss the countersuit, The Associated Press reported early Wednesday.
Earlier, the blog Krebs on Security wrote that MasterCard and Visa have told banks that the “major breach” could involve more than 10 million card numbers compromised between Jan. 21 and Feb. 25. The post noted that the affected information could be used to make counterfeit new cards.
Unlike Spain and Ireland, where collapsing house prices have similarly threatened household and bank solvency, the Netherlands did not experience a construction boom that would have sent joblessness skyward when the real-estate bubble popped. Dutch unemployment is, for now, below 5%. But private debt has sapped consumption and investment, putting the country into recession since the third quarter of 2011. The country's fiscal troubles are a consequence of its broader economic woes, not their cause.

More than a decade after 9/11, it is a national embarrassment that our airport security system remains so hopelessly bureaucratic and disconnected from the people whom it is meant to protect. Preventing terrorist attacks on air travel demands flexibility and the constant reassessment of threats. It also demands strong public support, which the current system has plainly failed to achieve.
COPENHAGEN—Shares in Danish Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world's largest wind turbine maker, fell Wednesday after it released a set of vastly consensus-missing—and by its own admission disappointing—first-quarter results that it attributed to delayed order hand-overs and high costs of new turbine models.

Only a month after Martin's death, a narrative deeply rooted in racial stereotypes is being constructed. Initial reports in the media focused inordinately upon the fact that Martin was wearing a hoodie when Zimmerman confronted him. More recently, the media has been reporting that Martin was suspended from school for possessing an empty plastic bag with traces of marijuana. This and other facts, having nothing to do with whether Zimmerman was justified in using deadly force, are being used to paint the all too familiar stereotype of African American as violent criminal.

Led by director of music ministries Jason C. Tramm, the New Jersey State Opera Orchestra and the choir offered several vivid scenes of Haydn’s setting of texts from Genesis and Milton’s “Paradise Lost.” With tenor Ronald Naldi as the angel Uriel, “Now vanished by the holy beams” captured the flight of “hell’s black spirits” with urgency; its slithering descending strings and forceful, hardy contribution from the choir gave eerie effects.

Judged by the headlines per capita generated, you'd have to go with the Boston Red Sox. We all know what Stephen King's next book will be: "Full Dark, No Stars -- at Fenway." But from a baseball view, I think the Braves plummet has been far more surprising and damning for that organization. We all know the big number. A month ago, the Braves had a 10 1/2-game lead in the wild card and they were widely considered the second-base team in the National League, ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers and whoever the NL West had to offer. Atlanta was a worthy challenger to the league's Goliath, the Philadelphia Phillies. My, how things have changed. The Braves' pitching has ruptured, their brilliant young relievers have faded with fatigue and overuse, and the offense has vanished. The Red Sox lost their lead to the Tampa Bay Rays, a team good enough to win either of the other AL divisions and contend for three of the playoff berths available in the NL. Atlanta hasn't had that quality of opponent on their heels, and still they've faltered, letting losing teams defy them and the Cardinals nearly catch them.

"It would create new costs," said Ben Johnson, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or ODJFS, which administers the state's unemployment compensation program. "It would be expanding benefits based on a one-time infusion of money."
Chamberlin was quick to admit he's addicted to fishing, whether he's after small panfish or jumbo-sized trout and salmon.

On the other hand, Chris Hawkins has the perfect stove. It just never gets used because he doesn't cook. So this Thanksgiving, the San Francisco businessman was prepared to push a button on his Blackberry's speed dial for a heat-and-serve turducken, a semi-boneless turkey stuffed with duck and chicken, to be delivered to his door. If only he could find a nice girl to bring home to his high-end professional range.

For the most part, we've become a society of caution, of prudence, and of rationality. If you're employed by someone -- and most of us are, because as Bob Dylan said, you gotta serve somebody -- you might love your job. But it would still be extremely rare for you to feel so loyal to your coworkers, you'd come into work with broken ribs. Even your coworkers would consider that irrational behavior. Your job would have to be at stake.

The final step before sending the product abroad is the dirty and energy-intensive method of turning the gas into liquid. To create liquefied natural gas (LNG), the gas must to undergo a massive super-cooling process, which is exactly what Maryland's proposed Cove Point facility would be designed to do. But most people don't realize that the enormous amount of energy this process requires makes LNG's overall greenhouse gas pollution similar to that of coal. So much for the argument that natural gas is a "clean" alternative to coal-burning power plants.
Beyond these findings, I have spoken with friends and colleagues who lived in New York City and the District of Columbia before and after their respective FCBs, and they describe quite dramatic improvements in the general quality of life in both cities.

Something extra: Social Hour works at the bar and patio area only, but the most popular spot is the high tables behind the bar. Made for four, these wood-topped tables are close enough to the bar to easily order a second round of drinks or an additional appetizer and still cozy enough to have an intimate moment with friends. If it is a beautiful day, the patio becomes a popular spot. It is made for people-watching, and the wood tables and cane chairs give it a porchlike feel.

Gogol Bordello's novel combination of soul, world beat, punk, reggae, rap and traditional gypsy music has earned the New York group invitations to Bonnaroo and the Dave Matthews Caravan. Gogol has been pulled into the jam band circuit while retaining much of its hipster credibility, and lead singer Eugene Hütz would probably have been recognized by Zappa as a kindred spirit (and not just because Hütz wears a similar moustache).

Gulley: We haven’t yet experienced the improvements in the economy. We are encouraged by the increased number of applications we have for enrollment in the fall, but it is too early to tell if the results will benefit the bottom line.

The Plain Dealer made good use of Dugan's many talents in those days. Editors and writers in all departments went to him with stories, and he'd find just the right way to illustrate the subject, or craft a cartoon to capture the story's mood.

It is also perfectly trivial. What Didion does is something more difficult and enduring. Although she has an acute sense of historical decay -- of the discontinuities that estranged the Haight-Ashbury generation from their parents' universe, of the focus-group politics that have estranged us from Washington -- her writing encompasses far more than stories of contemporary decline. Despite our nostalgic illusions -- of the sort she dissolved in her 2003 book on California, "Where I Was From" -- no center has ever held. Her pieces examine how lives do and do not withstand such disintegration.

Cut a block of firm tofu into four equal, thick slices and bake for a few hours. The tofu gets a nice, chewy texture that I like to cube and toss into stir-fries. You can also bake the tofu in a sticky-sweet marinade and not worry about it burning the way it would in a hotter oven.

Education is at its core a people business. And Project Restore would not have been as effective, or even implemented, without a bold team of passionate teachers and a strong principal willing to stand up to the school district's bureaucracy.

The police reinvestigation this year determined that the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Vanecko threw the punch. It also found that Koschman never struck Vanecko and had been arguing not with him but with Denham.

Research by the Mono Basin Clearinghouse showed that it was the latest closing date since records began being kept in 1933. The road opened in 1915, but wasn't paved until 1937. The group put the average 79-year opening date as May 29 and closing date as Nov. 2.
There are always oysters with a different sauce (2 for $5), but the best item is the house-made potato chips ($7) served with horseradish creme fraiche and a house-cured salmon roe that's mildly sweet and briny; it's something that I wanted to eat by the spoonful without any embellishment. As much as they may want to change things often, I predict this dish will have to remain.
In your answer to “Dismayed,” the 32-year-old woman with a Ph.D. who was unimpressed by the men she was meeting, I was struck by how cold and calculating it all sounds: Women evolved to marry money and power; men look for eye candy to parade around on their arms. As a man who doesn’t bring money or power to the table, what do I have to give up? Why can’t you just fall in love like you got hit by a ton of bricks and have that be enough?

FORT COLLINS — Fort Collins Police Lt. Jim Broderick, accused of felony perjury related to his work in the Tim Masters murder investigation, this morning was advised of his rights in a Larimer County court room.
Westboro's last known appearance here was in 2006, and the Oregon members of the Patriot Guard Riders, a national coalition of motorcycle-riding veterans and other patriots, did their best to stop Westboro bullies by attending a Hood River service and creating a human shield between mourners and protesters. Without any law, they created a powerful "buffer zone" that brought many of us to tears and made us forever grateful.

Money flowed magically from my pocket. Using my parental Shield Charm to deflect Isobel's sudden desire, two months shy of her 13th birthday, to possess her own movie tie-in magic wand, I let her buy a black T-shirt identifying her as a member of the Harry Potter film crew. I bought a key chain affixed with Hermione's time-turner, which enables its owner to return to the past. I bought a refrigerator magnet with a moving photo of Harry on it for my older daughter, Alice, 15, who was not pleased about not being there. I bought some enchanted candy. I spent more than 50 pounds.

Kean testified along with the president of Rutgers, Richard McCormick, and the president of Montclair State, Susan Cole. The trio said they hoped voters will be able to vote next year by referendum on whether the state can borrow money to invest in higher education.
A fair enough observation, but hasn't Cleveland been there before? Historically, the city had a public school system over which a school board that selected the superintendent presided, unimpeded by outside forces. This is the way that most of the country's almost 14,000 school districts operate, with 90 percent of them electing board members and 10 percent appointing them.

The Celtics used a 22-0 run in the first half to go up 43-17, and they never looked back, pouring it on and leading by as many as 43 in the second half before both teams cleared their benches to close out the game.
"I think we'll be speed-oriented," Frerotte said. "We don't have a lot of extremely big guys, so we have to do what's best. A lot of the offense is finding out what we have in two-a-days. When you find out what you've got and who wants to hit and who wants to play, then it's a lot better."

The duchess has faced considerable pressure in her first year as she has eased into her increasingly public royal role, but she has avoided any missteps, seeming to have benefited from strong family support and good advice from palace professionals.
''As South, you have 10 sure tricks between clubs and hearts once you get in, and you can't stand a diamond shift from East, so go up with the king of spades to reduce the chance of East getting in." (04/27/12)
Basically, it's hard to keep a secret in a palace where courtiers and servants are in close proximity to the royal bedroom. The king is a dandy who would much rather fool around with the seductive young La Valliere (Annie Grier) than be faithful to his wife, Queen Marie-Therese (Katie Hileman). The marriage to the Spanish-born Marie-Therese amounted to a political alliance between France and Spain, so romance scarcely enters into it. Moreover, the queen's brusque manners and heavy accent offend the etiquette-obsessed king.
Meanwhile, Thomas wonders how long this scenario can continue.
"Tyler's standing there, all 22-years-old of him, and he looked all of 16," Lax recalled. "I said, 'I'll do it if you'll do it with me.' He looked at me and said, 'I'll do it.'

But Halvorson noted that Jackson has failed to advance his hallmark plan for a new regional airport in Peotone after years of serving in Congress. "This is about who can actually represent the district and get things done," she said. "His signature project he still cannot get done."
A few days later, I saw a TV report about a gay pride parade in San Francisco. Instead of Shriners on go-carts and a cute homecoming queen, I saw nearly naked men painted in rainbow stripes, with fig leaf-sized scraps of something barely covering their boy bits. And the not-so-cute queens in that parade were not of the homecoming variety.
The year ahead is exciting, Fish N Loaves, a wonderful soul-food restaurant I reviewed in 2010, is moving into Johnson's Diner's old digs. Amway Center is pumping up business in downtown Orlando. I can't wait to see what restaurateur Manny Garcia and his partners have in mind for City Fire in the Dellagio complex off Orlando's Restaurant Row. Many of you are just discovering newbies such as Napa at the Peabody Hotel, Spencer's at the Hilton Orlando and The Boathouse in Winter Park. And while we have had many closings, restaurants and independent bakeries are thriving in Orange, Seminole, Lake, Osceola and Volusia counties.

Robert H.H. Hugman certainly would be pleased. As placards up and down the River Walk trumpet, Hugman was the San Antonio-born architect who, in 1929, came up with the Spanish-inspired plan to transform a muddy, meandering waterway that bisected the city center by paving over its banks, then building arched bridges, cobblestone pathways and stone stairs to the streets above. Hugman foresaw a veritable community within a community, with river-level shops and restaurants.

The 2009 thriller is the second installment of "The Da Vinci Code" conspiracy thriller series. This time Tom Hanks & Co. go to Vatican City as the Catholic Church picks a new pope against the backdrop of the massive St. Peter's Basilica.

Not content to merely sell other people's records, Mod Lang also runs a label of its own, having released CDs by such local acts as Chris Von Sneidern and Bart Davenport's old group, the Kinetics. The Mod Lang label's latest offering is a vinyl edition of the new album by psychedelic folksinger Devendra Barnhart. The couple go to shows three or more times a week and are fixtures on the local nightlife scene. At Slim's, for instance, Bradshaw is known simply as Shopkeeper.

It's a bit over 2 hours, but the director keeps a brisk pace. Though he takes time when it's called for, digging into Duncan's isolation and the father-son friction, with Damon and Ford mining the frustration and affection typical of the teenage years to good effect. That the much-loved wife and mother is no longer there to run interference between them makes the stakes higher and the hurts cut deeper.

The statistics include bills in which lawmakers are a prime sponsor, though it’s not unheard of for a bill to have half a dozen or more such sponsors. And sometimes the prime sponsors in one house are knocked off the top spot of a bill by the time the governor signs it.
The SL's front end is similar to that of the smaller SLK, and that, too, posed a problem with down-the-road-graphics. In other words, how to distinguish visually the larger and pricier car from its cousin? The solution to the DRG problem was the SL's distinctively huge and squarish headlight assemblies. Alas. The right-angled inner corners of these headlamps—a physician would call them the medial canthi—make the SL look more than a little cross-eyed. And yet, the headlamps almost work stylistically: Note the sinuous LED light bars that connect the fender contours to the shoulder lines with glowing filaments. Again, nighttime is this car's friend.

The White House says that U.S. crude oil production is at its highest since 2003. It also notes that foreign oil now accounts for less than 50 percent of U.S. consumption. But Republicans say there's more oil we could be producing, as well as oil we could bring in from Canada, were it not for foot-dragging by the White House. Who's right?

With Manning, the tight end takes on a greater importance in the offense — by a long shot. Manning has long considered a tight end who can work the middle of the field to be one of his most important matchups against a defense, and the Broncos figure to line up in a two-tight-end set, with the intention to pass out of it plenty in the coming season.

Why: Aside from having a wallpaper-worthy label (seriously, Betsey Johnson should make a pattern) Francoise and Pascal Frissant show off the beauty of higher elevations of the Minervois, a swath of France's Languedoc near the Mediterranean. The Minervois has at times been a source of unremarkable reds, but here's proof to the contrary. Grenache's happy berry flavors are in play, with Carignane and Syrah's rooty accents as a baseboard, bringing iodine, beetroot and hibiscus. Those dulcet Grenache tones can be deceiving; the 2009 has surprising mineral nuance and structure, more than enough to keep returning this bottle to your table. (Importer: Vintage 59 Imports)

One of soccer's most colorful characters, Keane often made headlines for the wrong reasons. One challenge contributed to the end of a rival's career and tarnished his own. Keane's feud with Alfie Inge Haaland began while the Norwegian was playing for Leeds in 1997.
