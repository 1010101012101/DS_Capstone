For a sixth-grader — Christina Paulsen — to write a loving and sincere “thank you” to her school bus driver, Julie Cicik, was very touching to me.

Gotham City is calm. A crusader has tucked away his cape. Millionaire Bruce Wayne is as glum as ever. What could possibly go wrong in the final installment of Christopher Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy and summer's most eagerly awaited film? Maybe a new nemesis with a garbled way of talking yet a powerful gift for rousing mass resentment. The most chilling — and prescient? — scene in the trailer? Anne Hathaway's character Selina Kyle (a.k.a. Catwoman) warning, "There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're going to wonder how you thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us?" (July 20, PG-13)

This is an epic intended for a wide audience, and so anthropomorphic schmaltz is part of the deal. But Spielberg, working with a screenplay by Lee Hall and Richard Curtis, manages to convey in purely cinematic terms not just the insane nightmare of World War I but the seemingly limitless capacity of human destructiveness. The vulnerability of Joey, the brave steed at the center of our keyed-up sympathy, is powerfully exploited. Not everyone will be able to keep their eyes open as the poor horse tries to survive the hell he's been thrust into. But the movie communicates with as much force as the stage version the hideous waste of war.
The Cardinals were OK with Duncan taking his binders with him because there was an intellectual property element to those items.

Unfortunately, some major obstacles stand in the way of expanding our money-saving model. One big hurdle is the reluctance of leading private health plans to contract with nurse practitioners as primary care providers.

I figured that if my friend Michelle and I were going to see if there was any truth to the urban legends about San Francisco Safeways being the place for some after-hours amour, then I'd better at least be honest about what I was shopping for. The items in my basket weren't subtle, even if I thought my cucumber was modest for the Castro. But what would you expect? Trying to communicate a complex personality and desire for deep connection with Hot Pockets, Cheeze Doodles and bourbon just wasn't going to yield phone numbers, which is what Michelle and I were gaming for. Any gender would do.

-- Just how much of the airport screening process will PreCheck actually bypass? That's obviously the top issue. TSA says, "Eligible passengers may be referred to a lane where they will experience expedited screening.

He made some of his most admired pictures during his first six years here, including his most famous image, a 1930 still life of a pepper that half-resembled a well-muscled torso. (As his grandson tells the story, the photographer placed the pepper in a funnel and used an eight-hour exposure to get the desired depth of field.) His fingernails were always black from using amidol, a developer, in the darkroom.

For the most part, however, federal workers can negotiate only working conditions, which gets to Kasich's underlying point -- public workers in Ohio would continue to have more collective-bargaining powers than most federal workers.
In a wide-ranging trip to Europe this year, I found three major new museums to love: in Amsterdam, the first satellite branch of Russia's celebrated Hermitage; in Rome, a long-awaited museum for contemporary arts that is a work of art itself; and in Paris, a picture gallery with a constantly changing program of special exhibitions meant to shake up the enterprise of art appreciation.

In Granta, Richard Rayner offers this self-lacerating perspective: "Los Angeles was a lot like South Africa. The apartheid wasn't enshrined by law, but by economics and geography, and it was just as powerful. In Los Angeles I was afraid of blacks in a way I never had been.

The money in question is raised through fees that state law imposes on new development. The money is supposed to be used to expand the supply of affordable housing. In 2008, the state gave towns four years to use it or lose it. Since then, 30 municipalities have spent nearly $100 million on these projects — a big win in a state with such expensive housing.
But how can the same party believe its okay for the government to deny equal treatment under the law to an entire class of citizens, based solely on who they are, and who they love? How can freedom in the most personal sense (who we marry) be less cherished than the economic freedom to choose whether or not to buy health insurance?

POWER SHAGGING (tr. v.; gerund noun) -- To power shag is to track fly balls during batting practice as if they were fly balls in games, i.e. running after line drives and scaling walls to prepare for game-like situations. I.e., Kapler was power shagging when he raced to catch a fly ball in BP and knocked his shoulder into the wall. "What makes Gabe Kapler so good is he doesn't differentiate between the game and practice," Yost said. "He shags BP balls as if they were the game. And that's how you stay on top of your game."

Real victory, argues Boston University political scientist Angelo M. Codevilla, "means having your own kind of peace. It means not having to worry about terrorist attacks or suffering 'security measures.' " Above all, Codevilla says, victory in this seemingly endless war against Islamic terrorism means nothing less than "undoing the regimes that embody terrorist causes." Any opportunity the United States may have had to accomplish such a victory has been wasted in Afghanistan.

A. Out-of-control tomatoes are normal at this time of the year. The hot weather and plenty of moisture have given them a good reason to grow. If you have added extra fertilizer, this is probably helping to produce the lanky, long shoots too. Try keeping liquid feedings to every other week and slow release products to about once a season. Make sure the plants are in the full sun to help keep them as compact as possible. As the cooler fall weather arrives the plants should slow down, fill with shoots and start producing some fruits too.

Still, the value of the Israeli military to American interests goes deeper. Its joint ventures with the US military have been essential in developing such high-tech weaponry as missiles, drones and Tactical High Energy Laser systems.

It's funny to read comments from "global-warming-scam" now. After our infamous county commissioner was exposed as the author of them or at least the person that owned the account from which they were posted the tone of them has changed. Now they have become more vicious, as if the author has become mad at the world because he got caught.

The rumblings are already there. Some examples: Sell to private landlords, then lease back, the state's office buildings; sell the Ohio Turnpike; privatize state prisons; and, because 90 percent of the tax on gross revenue of Ohio's new casinos would go to local governments, not the state government, maybe Ohio shouldn't share so much state tax revenue with Ohio's gazillion local governments.

A veteran of the bestsellers lists (especially for his tales of Sharpe, an English soldier in the Napoleonic era), Cornwell knows how to move the story along with clean, clear, well-oiled prose.

Studies support an association between the drugs and osteonecrosis of the jaw, a bone-killing infection often triggered by dental work. The condition is rare — rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been estimated at between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 — although Solomon, for one, thinks the rate may be significantly higher than that. In addition, the risks of these side effects can be minimized by taking some precautions, such as getting dental work done before starting on bisphosphonate therapy.

On several occassions when The Bird was pitching, my friends and I would pile into a car (each pitched in a $1 for gas), drive down to Detroit and purchase $4 obstructed view seats that were available at game time and watch The Bird do his thing.

"Only if, like, a special event is happened out there," he said. "Everybody brings their scraper bike and we'll be deep, you know, just riding around. There's about 20, 25 of us. But that ain't deep compared to Champ. He'd be having 50 to 100 in Oakland."
Part of it also was due to a more proactive growth strategy.

The trend toward 16-team superconferences picked up steam Sunday when the Atlantic Coast Conference announced it was officially picking off longtime Big East schools Pitt and Syracuse to continue cannibalizing its northern neighbor.

Do read: Nina Easton's Fortune magazine profile of Bill Daley, officially Obama's chief of staff and unofficially his ambassador to corporate America. The son and brother of former Chicago mayors, Daley made his first visit to Oval Office when he was 12 -- after John F. Kennedy's inauguration. Daley's coziness with Wall Street -- he ran J.P. Morgan's Midwest operations and sat on the bank's executive committee before coming to the White House -- and his criticism of last year's health reform bill (also before he went to work for the president, of course) don't sit well with the Democratic Left. But Obama's never had many personal ties to top corporate leaders -- which can exacerbate policy differences. Daley can help with that.

Thanks to the Civilian Conservation Corps, skiing became a wintertime recreation at Flagstaff. The corps, formed to provide employment during the Great Depression, built Snowbowl Road, and a rope tow, powered by a car engine, pulled skiers uphill. Lifts were added in 1958 and 1962, but it was not until the 1980s that the resort came into its own with larger and longer lifts and ski runs.

I definitely learned what Tom Shadyac is talking about in his documentary, "I Am." Shadyac suffered a brain injury in a bicycling accident. Since then, he's devoted his time and movie-making talent to asking, "What's wrong with our world?" and "What can we do about it?" The bottom line is that too many of us are focused on the wrong things: money, self and getting "ahead." Our interconnectedness, empathy and compassion are what make us special and what can tackle world problems. Some might see the movie as too liberal or excusing irresponsibility, but most of us will see what Shadyac wants us to: Science backs up the idea that we are all intricately connected and that individual actions can change the course of things that seem insurmountable, even war and hunger.

Critics of the deal between the city and the event authority might say that's a valid worry, seeing as how the event organizers are now insisting they get Pier 29 or some other extra property beyond the deal signed off on by the Board of Supervisors.

That's wise and thought provoking. A lot of people, including me, can fall into the rut of asking the former question instead of the latter. Obama said that judging government as too big or too small misses the point. Asking "whether (government) helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified," is a better route. "Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward," he said. "Where the answer is no, programs will end."
