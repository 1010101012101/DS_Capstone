I'm reliving that memorable game not to point out that the Bears need Ditka on the sidelines to snap this team out of its two-game funk, but to illustrate an element these Bears are lacking on offense, especially with injured Jay Cutler on the sidelines.

Rock stars, Jazzers, Pachucos...they may have grown up somewhere else quaint, like Sandusky, Ohio, or Canada, but they made their mark herelived, created and died here. Music is as much a part of the L.A. legacy as film and television. From the bebop rapture of the old Cotton Club in Culver City to the head-banging kicks of the Whiskey a Go-Goneighborhoods have changed, but the memories will last forever.

Since 1932, when descendants got together as First Families of Arizona, they have been trying to preserve their ancestors' unfiltered insights into what really happened during the state's formative years.

So how did this mantle fall to "The Hunger Games"? Browse through the young-adult section of any bookstore (or, more likely, Amazon.com) and you'll see any number of series that would seemingly lend themselves to the big-screen treatment. (You may also be thankful that, whether you like their quality or not, these series tend to consist of large-to-massive volumes that kids cannot wait to get their hands on, making reading cool again at a most unlikely time.) If "Hunger Games" is the flavor of the month -- and many months to come -- how do we identify the next one?

Los Angeles is so movie-saturated that you forget the crimes were real. A trip northeast of town to the Los Angeles Police Historical Society Museum - in a decommissioned police precinct headquarters - slaps sense into you.

Some time around Easter, medical school personnel will hold a quiet burial ceremony for the ashes of another 200 or so donors. The medical school does that twice each year, without fanfare. Family members sometimes place anonymous mementos, such as the CD and the beer can. Others put Christmas ornaments on the trees, or leave flowers or teddy bears. Once each month, cemetery workers sweep the place clean of all the personal touches, just as they do at all burial sites.

It's well known, for example, that the lack of good options bitterly divided the president's advisors and that the chief executive immersed himself in the details of the decision that ultimately produced a modified version of the "surge" strategy that the Bush administration used to stabilize — temporarily, at least — Iraq. The Joint Chiefs were similarly split over what to do in Afghanistan, as were the commanders on the ground. What Woodward's signature brand of exhaustive reporting and access to sources — including Obama — and timely documents provide are the voices and detailed anecdotes that put flesh on the people in the White House — right down to the name-calling and back-biting.

A: When Sheila Morrison-Pietras' husband, Rodney Morrison, died, they had two young daughters and really needed the support. They found that there wasn't anything in the Jackson area (where they lived), and they became a Monday night family at Ele's Place in Lansing. Many years later, the family moved to Chelsea and noticed just how sad the community was because of so many deaths that were occurring. There was a rollover accident with some high school girls and there was a helicopter crash with the police chief and the fire chief. The list was very, very long. They decided there should be an Ele's Place in Ann Arbor to reach more kids. We opened our doors here in May of 2007.

Fiennes' adaptation (done with veteran playwright and screenwriter John Logan) makes much of that relationship. It's clear that Coriolanus has been bred for battle since the nursery.

Thanks to last week's news coverage, many have heard of the new Sheikh Zayed and Charlotte R. Bloomberg Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital, but there is another building at Hopkins that remains largely unknown: the Blalock Clinical Science Building. Two years ago, I watched the PBS documentary, "Partners of the Heart" during a tour of Johns Hopkins with a small group of students. It showed how two men, Alfred Blalock and Vivien Thomas, equally contributed to help save the lives of 170,000 children suffering from blue baby syndrome. Blalock received worldwide recognition and the above building in his name, while Thomas was recognized decades later with an honorary degree and a portrait. The reason is that Vivien Thomas was an African American who worked during times of segregation.
For instance, the state recommends against building a wind turbine within three miles of a breeding site for sage grouse, a bird that could soon be added to the list of endangered species.
Meanwhile, I took the slacker's route. After I changed trains in Béziers, the locomotive now snaked along the Orb River through a lush, hilly landscape of stone villages surrounded by neat rows of cypresses and vines, the pale blue peaks of the Massif Central rising behind it all. An Edith Piaf tune played in my head, entirely beyond my control. Why hadn't I heard more about this Aveyron region? Does the powerful cheese foul the air?
At first, Ku, also a Korean American, was "dismissive and indifferent" to his business, Otero said. "She referred to my gaming ventures as 'a hobby.' "

No good behavior is too insignificant for warm praise from his therapist, including peeling and eating a banana, washing his hands or using a trash can. Undesirable behavior -- sitting with limbs askew instead of cross-legged, for example -- elicits coldly delivered instructions to do better.

"We've planted 500,000 pine trees, and that will turn the landscape to what it was before," McIntire says. Pine trees take 45 to 50 years to mature, however, so perhaps our grandchildren will enjoy a forested park.

Once the suspension is over, it's critical that your medical wishes are documented and known by your doctors. It's also critical that you've named someone close to you who will act as your "agent" (the term used in California) or "proxy" to make healthcare decisions for you if you're unable to do so for yourself.
The case stems from a 2006 incident in which park rangers approached several Ramapough men who were riding ATVs near Stag Hill Road in Mahwah. A confrontation occurred, and Walder drew his gun and shot Mann, who died nine days later.

More than three years after Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered marriage licenses granted to same-sex couples in February 2004, the filing of opening briefs -- the best chance for the city and the couples to lay out their positions -- was a key step in a case that, perhaps within a year, could yield a closely-watched ruling.

I am always fascinated and appalled by the kudzu vines beside the highway. At this time of year, I saw carpets of bright green kudzu leaves on the ground and shrouds of tangled brown vines hanging from dead, grey trees strangled by last year’s growth. Further into the woods, I took note of dark green, shiny Mountain Laurel bushes — not quite in bloom, yet. Many trees on the edge of the road have been invaded by some type of tent caterpillars — their triangular white nests have been woven in thousands of tree forks. I worry about the health of the trees when the caterpillars hatch and begin their voracious eating.

During its bailout, bankruptcy and restructuring under Fiat's control from 2008-2010, Chrysler was inwardly focused on forging a strategy to survive and had pulled back from community and civic involvement. But as Chrysler's car and truck sales recovered and its finances stabilized, the company -- and the Italian-born, Canadian-raised Marchionne -- emerged as vocal champions of Detroit.
Since the appearance of "Hard Candy," Madonna and her husband, filmmaker Guy Ritchie, divorced. This is not an idle fact here - it's a thread tangled and knotted throughout the album. Madonna is moody, Madonna is mad, Madonna is forlorn and Madonna is sad. Skip the utterly forgettable first track and latest single (the cliché-ridden, Madonna-by-numbers "Girl Gone Wild") and dive into the ice water of "Gang Bang," a glitchy, downtempo techno throw-down that's a wholly different dance-floor confession - the kind detectives wheedle out in interrogation rooms. After expressing her desire to shoot her lover in the head, Madonna gleefully, sinisterly snarls, "I wanna see him die / over and over and over and over …"
No Blazers player was immune to shooting woes during the early cold spell, as all 10 players who played in the first half missed a shot.
Nuclear power’s economic advantages make it an increasingly attractive option. New Jersey has experienced an average growth in gross state product of 1.4 percent over the past five years. Because the Oyster Creek plant is scheduled to close in 2019, 10 years ahead of schedule, new sources of electricity will be needed to take its place and meet increasing demand for power. Relying heavily on renewable energy sources would be very costly and unrealistic.

The new-generation royals in Morocco, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, who do have the legitimacy to pull people together and drive change, are probably the most effective leaders in the region today. Burson-Marsteller just published its annual Arab Youth Survey, which found that more young Arabs said they would like to live in the United Arab Emirates than any other Arab state, because of how it has built Dubai and Abu Dhabi into global hubs and job engines.

In the late 1930s and 1940s, when R.C. Hoiles was reading everything he could get his hands on and working out a political philosophy, which evolved from a fairly standard-issue devotion to the U.S. Constitution to a full-fledged fealty to what he called "voluntarism" (which most people today would call libertarianism, though he was never quite comfortable with that label) he was going much more against the tide than we are today. President Roosevelt had installed the New Deal, to the applause of almost all the cultured classes, and John Maynard Keynes had provided the theoretical economic underpinning, which quickly came to dominate academe, for widespread government intervention into the economy.

There was a time not so long ago when Minaj was one of the coming forces in hip-hop: a rare female voice in a wilderness of dudes, and one with little taste for self-effacement. "Starships" completes her transformation into a figure less interested in making music than in calling attention to her brand. Nine reasons to pay attention to something else: Snow Tha Prodict, Dominique Young Unique, Azealia Banks, K Flay, Jean Grae, Iggy Azalea, LoLa Monroe, Angel Haze, Muthoni the Drummer Queen. Heck, throw in Kreayshawn and make it an even ten; at least she’s not so concerned with her dividends that she’s willing to throw her personality away.

The only question is in the Best Actress category where Viola Davis's put-upon maid in "The Help" holds the slightest of leads over heavyweight Meryl Streep's turn as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in "The Iron Lady."

As a relative newcomer to the area of young adult novels, I was very interested to hear what they had to say. Each author related how their story evolved from an idea to a published book. For example Jody Feldman had a young boy ask what is next after "Charles and the Chocolate Factory"?

Watch how sort of in-depth Leo (DiCaprio) goes with something, and then watch how professional Julia is when she approaches something and then watch the fun that Johnny has when he brings something to the set.
"I was looking forward to not being a sick patient anymore," she said.
Recklessly dumping these GM shares, rather than managing them prudently, could cost taxpayers billions. Treasury officials have carefully stayed outside the GM boardroom and have sought to balance the need to divest the government's stake in GM with the need to maximize the return on the taxpayers' investment. That is the right approach. Yet Romney says he wants to force a fire sale in the effort to make a partisan point. The very notion of the taxpayer stake in GM is offensive to him, and in order to eliminate that offense, he would make taxpayers suffer.
Although traditional Irish pubs are in decline at home, their numbers are soaring around the world. In dozens of countries, travelers can seek out the real McCoy — or Mooney's — designed and built on the auld sod of Ireland before being disassembled and shipped to Australia, Dubai, India and other far-flung lands.
After Mom, Florence Terry, died in 1993, her trunk came to my house. But the old taboo kept me from opening it for years. On what would have been her 100th birthday, I ventured to lift the lid. The contents were not earth-shaking, but revealing.

However, private student loan borrowers risk significant increases in their monthly loan payments with variable rates, Kantrowitz says. There's no simple rule of thumb, but a 1 percent increase in interest rates will typically yield about a 5 percent increase in the monthly loan payments on a 10-year term, 9 percent on a 20-year term and 12 percent on a 30-year term, he says.
The Tehran mullahs have rebuffed (to say the least) real dialogue with everyone on nuclear and related matters. They have repeatedly and clearly stated their willingness — even eagerness — to take human lives, including presumably those close to them and their own, for reasons justified by their misguided theological views.

TIGHT ENDS – Halahuni, Prince, Hamlett, Perry. Comment: Question mark No. 4. And a huge one at that. At this writing, we do not know if Joe “The Tank’’ will need surgery on his left shoulder. He finds out Tuesday during a visit with a San Diego Chargers’ doctor. … easing the pain of Halahuni possibly not being ready to go until mid-September or later, Prince is a runaway train at 6-3, 266, and Hamlett was one of the stars of the Spring Game.
The result was a somewhat deflated Empire Polo Club, when the three-day country music extravaganza should have been in prime "proceed to party" mode.
Feelings toward raptors were considerably less warm from the 1700s through 1940, when the U.S. passed a bald eagle protection act. Conservationists call it the shooting era. The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, was vilified as a cowardly scavenger and raptors in general were shot as threats to ducks, chickens and young livestock.

I'm not sold on Jason Hammel. He's off to an incredible start, especially at homer-friendly Camden Yards, but two of those starts were against the Blue Jays. Hammel always had middling numbers in ERA (4.63) and WHIP (1.403) over three full seasons in Colorado, but his strikeout rate dipped from 7.1 K/9 in 2010 to 5.0 in 2011. Whether his early success is due to the move to the AL or improvement in velocity remains to be seen. I wouldn't start him this week with games at the Yankees and Red Sox. And, oh yeah, Baltimore still has 51 games to play against those Yankees and Red Sox, not to mention the Rays.

I believe in the law and in the rule of law. And my heart can say, well I'd like to help this person and that person, but I'll follow the law and believe that in the case of the bankruptcy process, the company should have gone into bankruptcy, and as part of that process, the court should have determined what the rights were of the various parties under the bankruptcy proceeding.

We have this classical format like you have your composers, like Bach, and people play exactly what they wrote. It's the written-down music system. We don't have that written-down system, but our system is very scientific. It follows ragas — melody forms — and one is free to play a raga maybe for three hours, but you can make it as short as 15 minutes, even 10 minutes, and these are all my way of presenting to the West. It's like editing in films. So I give the whole gamut of our classical music, starting with the 13th century or so, which has been taught orally. It's not written-down music, so we have the freedom to improvise. And each time it comes out as new. That's why it's always fresh. I never feel like I've been repeating myself.

Flawed data was exactly what the right-leaning Heritage Foundation was trying to illuminate in its late-summer report "Air Conditioning, Cable TV, and an Xbox: What is Poverty in the United States Today?" In the report, researchers blamed the same poor accounting to make the point that the problem of poverty is not really as bad as the media's misplaced attention to worst-case scenarios would have you believe.

A perfect night at the Congress might unfold thusly: happy hour in the lobby, with Duran providing an early evening serenade, followed by dinner in the hotel's Cup Café or Maynards Market & Kitchen across the street (I've had some of my best meals in town at both places), then a long night of live music in the Club and finally a late breakfast or brunch the next morning.

We've been saying for years that a filtered cup has blood-vessel-loving, brain-enhancing, headache-defeating powers and more! And now we know sipping four cups of coffee throughout the day reduces your risk for type 2 diabetes by 50 percent. How does coffee do that? Turns out, it's more than the caffeine that fends off high blood sugar; other chemicals in the brew stop damage to the building blocks of diabetes-preventing proteins. True, coffee can have side effects: anxiety, migraine headaches, abnormal heartbeats, gastric upset. If you get these, cut back on the Joe so the risks don't outweigh the benefits.

That's a lot of plates to juggle, both for the detectives and the audience. Mann seems to have inherited her father's gift for moody atmospheres -- this truly looks like a place where you wouldn't even want to stop for gas -- but falls short in the storytelling department. Perhaps the blame falls on Don Ferrarone, who wrote the screenplay. Whatever the case, nobody seems to know quite how to end the thing; Mann goes with a bang and a whimper.

Rather, he's after something more elusive: identity, we might call it, which he understands to be not fixed but fluid, a set of reactions or impressions in evolution, a constant variation on the self. "(W)hat this means, in practice," he notes in the text of a lecture called "On Autobiographical Fiction," "is that you have to become a different person to write the next book. The person you already are already wrote the best book you could. There's no way to move forward without changing yourself. Without, in other words, working on the story of your own life. Which is to say: your autobiography."
Our tasting of 20 wines wasn't quite as auspicious this time. But we did find several standout 2009s, plus examples from the glorious 2008 vintage and colder 2010 that reaffirmed beliefs about Riesling's abilities in Oregon.
Certified nutritional consultants in California are not licensed, so we cannot diagnose or prescribe medication. What we do is endeavor to support health using food, positive lifestyle changes, herbs and/or supplements to help empower people in self-care. A holistic approach seeks to find underlying causes that may contribute to current health concerns. It's difficult to be a full-time nutritional consultant because of the limited client stream and frequency, unless you are fortunate to partner with a licensed professional who can send clients your way. In general, we have to work part-time in some other capacity and spend at least one day a week marketing ourselves. I currently teach about 400 hours a year at Bauman College, so that's been my other part-time job. In addition, I have previously provided nutrition courses (and, in some cases, still do) at Hawthorn University, Thousand Oaks Elementary School, Albany Adult School, Elephant Pharmacy, John F. Kennedy University and San Quentin State Prison.

Mike Freeman, CBSSports.com: "This is what you hear from NFL players all the time. Commissioner Roger Goodell doesn't really care about players. Goodell is a dictator. A bully. Goodell is arrogant and oh, yeah, Goodell doesn't really care about the players. But what an investigation into the New Orleans Saints and a despicable bounty system revealed shows the opposite. It shows that sometimes players, who push for safety, are hypocrites. While talking on one hand about their concerns regarding concussions, in another moment they are openly contriving to badly injure fellow players for chump change. It shows that on occasion it is indeed actually Goodell who attempts to control the more primal and at times disgusting tendencies of some players who do things when the cameras are off and no one is looking."
"The Art of Disegno: Italian Prints and Drawings From the Georgia Museum of Art" offers a look at 53 exquisite works on paper from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

Dano, who played the brother who refused to speak in Little Miss Sunshine, speaks plenty here, his voice a whiny, cracking instrument that would seem no match for Day-Lewis' commanding baritone.

He was dissatisfied with all extant mussel knives. So he made a better one himself. He looks forward to testing it in the shoals.
