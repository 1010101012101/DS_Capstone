I know a physicist who loves his work. People mistake his constant focus and thought with unhappiness. But he's not unhappy. He's busy. I bet when he dies, there will be a book on his chest. Happiness is a treadmill of a goal for people who are not happy by nature. Being an unhappy person does not mean you must be sad or dark. You can be interested, instead of happy. You can be fascinated instead of happy.

Outlook: The Brewers' starting pitching, strong at the top with Zack Greinke and Yovani Gallardo, fell short in the postseason last year and hasn't been improved.

The plateau around Lake Patzcuaro in Michoacan, best known for its Day of the Dead celebration, is the domain of the indigenous Purhepecha people. Pirekua, their gently rhythmical traditional music, originated with pre-Hispanic indigenous cultures, but as practiced today it is laced with African and European colonial influences. At least 30 regional variations have been found among roughly 100,000 Purhepecha people living in 165 villages. Performers may be men or women, performing as solos or in duets or trios. They might be accompanied by choral groups or orchestras with or without wind instruments. Pirekua is often sung in the P'urhépecha language and interpreted in Spanish, but sometimes it is presented as an instrumental, usually characterized by stringed instruments. Performers are famously creative in interpreting songs of past generations to relate to a wide range of historical, religious and political thought, always including love and courtship.

He is describing here the death of little Nell, and one pleasure of this volume is to track his "set of characters" — Sam Weller and Oliver Twist and Pip and Martin Chuzzlewit and Mrs. Micawber and the rest — as they fire his imagination, then fade into cold print. He could be generous, uproarious, incisive or discursive and, on matters of business, quarrelsome. His every sentence has flair. He writes with reference to prison reform, the pleasures of a nighttime stroll and the travails of his journeys to America and Italy; he writes devastatingly of the failed poetic efforts of a man who sent him amateur verse: "lock up your papers, burn your pen, and thank Heaven you are not obliged to live by it."

The film opens by introducing the rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais), who recites his morning prayers on a prayer rug, undergoes a grueling physical workout, and then tenderly kisses his pregnant wife goodbye.

Wearing clothes that make you stand out from all the others is a dimwitted move, but then again, how bright is Tama (Ray Sahetapy), the crime lord, by barricading himself on the TOP floor? Elementary strategy suggests he can be cornered there. He reminds me of my beloved movie cliche, The Climbing Killer.

Maybe Cooper never had to play such bad Michigan teams as Tressel does now, but, in that regard, you can't say enough about Rich Rodriguez, Carr's successor.

Rich Rod's team will go a bowl at last this year, albeit one low in significance and high in indifference.

Dear Margo: I've been close to "Maggie" for 30 years, from the time we were young mothers in our 20s. We've always had a joke pledge that we would never do anything to our faces. I don't know what your position is, but we both thought it was unnecessary and phony. Well, lo and behold, Maggie, after some weeks away ("visiting a cousin"), returns looking, uh, quite refreshed. I mean, the wrinkles are gone, and so are the jowls. What would you suggest I say to open this discussion? — Longtime Friend

The "quiz" part of the program was beside the point. The meat of "You Bet Your Life" was Marx's sharp interrogation of contestants.

The Groucho we remember from the movies would materialize, all bouncing eyebrows and bobbing cigar.

"It'd be nice to thin out the traffic at the (headquarters) area," said Karl Tallman, the chief ranger for several parks in the Santa Cruz Mountains, including Big Basin. "On Saturdays and Sundays, on nice days, there are so many cars parked or idling here. It takes away from the aesthetic."
The Kings threw every kind of defense imaginable at Aldridge last night, and they're a big and physical team. In the past couple of years we would possibly have seen L.A. back down from a challenge like this, and settle for outside shots. Not anymore.

Soon enough, we encountered a massive wall of gray rock that turned out to be Hogan Dam. When you ride parallel to the dam, the climb doesn't look like much. But we were getting tired, and this climb began to sap our strength. Yes, we were running out of gas. But that's part of the plan: If you finish a big ride and still feel fresh, maybe you didn't go hard enough.

Russo was right. His show is freewheeling and offbeat — and a surprise hit. That program director isn't at the station anymore, but program director and radio veteran Leslie Fram has given the deejay the liberty to be as playful as he wants to be. Free to play whatever catches his ear, "Anything Anything" feels like a throwback to a bygone era of personality-driven radio playlists. Russo chases whims: On his March 6 show, he spun four songs in a row with the word "alligator" in their titles.
SLUH isn't as big as it's been in the recent past. Instead, it is going with a mostly guard rotation with Daniel Schmidt (6-5) playing in the post. What SLUH lacks in athleticism it more than makes up for in poise and wits. Down 11 points midway through the third quarter, it would have been easy to let Maplewood have its way with the rest of the game and run them out of the gym. Instead the Jr. Billikens caught their breath and went back to work. It was impressive to watch.

Wolfe tells his patients to drink a glass of milk about 20 minutes before taking the drugs first thing in the morning, because the protein and calcium will stimulate acid production, and the drugs works best after you've been fasting overnight.

While it's best to drink the coffee or milk before taking the medication, you can also take the drugs with the beverages, if need be, he says.

Peeta asks Donald if he knows anything about the quickstep. Given his display of "DWTS" superfandom last week, I'm sure he does. Peeta says she's given Donald a very hard routine. In rehearsal, Donald drops into a split (impressive!) and them comes up wincing (ouch!). This song, "Stay the Night" by James Blunt, starts out so slow -- I hope it picks up or their quickstep is going to look really weird. Donald's kicks and flicks are high and high-energy. The song only ever briefly seemed to be as fast as they were dancing. Weird music selection there. Len apologizes to Donald and says that he undermarked Donald last week.

He saw a man sitting next to the water tower, with his back to him. The man was on his knees. Boynton couldn't see what he was doing. He walked quietly down the path as not to bother the man.

"And he gets up and he looks all disheveled and I don't know, just tired and all shaking and he walked up to me and as he walked down to me, he was walking slowly... I could see red on his hand... red all smeared on his shirt." When the man was about 10 feet from Boynton, he said: "I am going to kill you." Boynton said the man looked right in his eyes as he said it. "And I said, 'Why would you kill me? I haven't done anything to you.' And he looked kind of angry and confused.

Nicolaus Balla, who earned three stars cooking Japanese dishes at Nombe, turned his talents to Hungarian food when he took over the kitchen at this restaurant owned by Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt from Tartine Bakery. Who knew that he grew up in Budapest and loved the food? He's given the menu a light California touch; you might even find a little Japanese seaweed adding its umami to many dishes. Balla is also a master at pickles - there's often at least five on the menu. For his part, bread master Robertson makes a fried potato bread. The restaurant has recently been remodeled to include a space next door and a sandwich and retail shop.

The show was packed with filler -- a montage whose theme seemed to be "movies we liked years ago"; a compilation of actors talking about the first movies they saw; and a 5-minute performance by Cirque du Soleil (introduced by Kermit and Miss Piggy) that had only the remotest connection to the subject at hand.

No part of the Cardinals team had a bigger in-season overhaul than the bullpen, which turned out to be one of the units integral to the team's success. Through the dramatic September comeback drive and the even-more dramatic October pennant chase, the depth of the bullpen, with its mix of arms young and old, left and right, was instrumental.
The difference she made: Skowronek, her daughter and varsity cheerleader Natalie Skowronek, and about 10 other girls decided to sell the shirts. The issue caused a divide between the school and the community, and resonated throughout the country. The cheer booster club ended up disbanding. The girls collected more than $10,000 for breast cancer research, and are still selling the $15 shirts through saveyourbumps@yahoo.com.
Martina describes herself as an athlete and breast cancer survivor. And says after breast cancer she didn't see any reason to fear dancing. Tony says, "I'm not the bad boy or the bad boy's brother" and that he's ready to win the trophy. It's a Dovolani/Chmerkovskiy feud! Martina says that what scares her the most is the "high heels." Now, see, Martina can get away with saying she's not very feminine waaaaay more than a traditionally beautiful woman like Maria. I absolutely love the way the announcer says "Navratilova." Whoa, the back of Martina's dress is almost entirely sheer and she is still in tremendous shape. You can see her trying to remember the steps in her head, as they foxtrot to "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby," but she looks great and her athletic background means she's not visibly panting in front of the judges. Carrie Ann compliments her beauty and wants her to work on her spins. Len wants more wow, less caution. Is that Chris Evert in the audience? I remember watching tennis as a kid when their rivalry was so huge. Martina has a sense of humor when Brooke compliments her on her appearance saying, "With all this hair, with all this makeup … If I don't look good now, it's over."
With one week left before the Legislature’s session ends, we’re at a crossroads. Will the unions come to the table and make concessions on some basic but vital reforms Connecticut needs to move forward? Or will the state with the nation’s largest achievement gap fall further behind?

That's good news. The Oregonian's project most closely resembles (at the moment) the J-Lab project at the Seattle Times. That project has already resulted in some partners seeing traffic increases of up to 400%. A survey conducted by J-Lab and released today, finds that the Seattle Times project, now over a year old, has garnered significant public support. The report says that 8 out of 10 respondents appreciated the Times for helping them find local blogs and news sites.

This year, the state pension system should have been replenished with a $3 billion payment from the state budget, according to the actuaries who calculate the benefits owed to retired workers. But Christie and the Legislature decided not to pay anything toward the pension obligation in the new state budget to keep spending even with revenue projections. Corzine, like many governors before him, also short-funded the pension system for budget relief.

* Why did the police decide to close the case "exceptionally," on their own, rather than consult with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, as they did in 2004, and ask prosecutors either to consider filing criminal charges against Vanecko or present the case to a grand jury to decide if charges were warranted?
But now the role appears to be his. Another option would be Daniel Murphy, but Collins wants Murphy to remain aggressive. As a leadoff hitter, Collins explained during the spring, Murphy would be forced to take pitches, which may reduce his value.

The turning point, according to trade expert Ravi Batra, came in 1968, with the conclusion of the so-called Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations.

But the storm is expected to subside early today and the hiatus beyond Monday night - when postponed Sunday games long have been rescheduled - has drawn cries that the decision was based more on TV contracts than competitive balance.

I talked to him about trying to be positive with me, keep me in a positive light and I think that's something that can help me because he is such a big influence on my game and my overall mentality. Positivity, stay positive, because I think if I stay positive and I'm having fun, like last year at the beginning of the season with St. Louis, I was having fun, just relaxing, playing the game, and I played great. If I can try to do that all year, stay positive, have a lot of positive vibe coming at me, it'll help my game."

BJC Health Care has negotiated contracts that prevent insurance companies or other outside entities - including employers, who pay for their workers' health insurance - from sharing information on quality and cost at its hospitals.

But as Paul has risen in the polls, he has faced increased scrutiny, such as over newsletters published under his name that contained racist and inflammatory language.

-The villain isn't necessarily the thing. Every great movie needs a memorable villain, a bravura performance by a known actor, like Jack Nicholson's Joker - or Heath Ledger's Joker, for that matter. Except perhaps to his most ardent supporters, Tom Hiddleston's Loki won't, it's safe to say, go down as one of the iconic villain performances of all time. Yet that was hardly a hindrance to the movie's runaway success.

That landscape is El Monte, once a dusty Spanish colonial crossroads and now a bustling bedroom community about a dozen miles east of downtown Los Angeles. It already boasts at least one famous literary stepson, crime-thriller author James Ellroy, who briefly lived there with his mother in the post- World War II era. Cheech Marin also is a former denizen. Yet another onetime resident, Frank Zappa, immortalized El Monte in a song.
When the interstate system was created in 1956, a federal per-gallon gasoline tax was enacted to provide a stream of revenue for the Highway Trust Fund. The federal government paid 90 percent of the construction costs, with the states making up the rest.

Conforto added his fourth RBI of the game in the eighth when he drove a double over the center fielder, scoring Davis from first. It gave the Beavers a two-run cushion after UCSB scored twice in the sixth to pull within one.
But there are surprises, too. Spaghetti and Meatballs are made reflux-safe with chicken broth-lightened tomato sauce and careful portion control. Grass-Fed Beef and Portobello Blue Cheese Burgers have meaty mushrooms and a small amount of strong cheese. These dishes may seem like no-no's, but the smart approach to portion control and strategic use of flavors make the recipes quite light and satisfying at the same time.

"Not everybody has a happy ending," Tew said. "This is kind of as happy as mine is getting -- and I'm okay with that."
Ernesto's revealed itself to me slowly. The first time, the serving of meatball soup, albondigas, was pleasant and subtle with a mildly beefy broth. I liked the mainstay tortilla soup even more. The nicely flavored broth is thin, not creamy, and the soup is loaded with vegetables, along with crisp tortilla strips and a large topping of fresh avocado.

Two gems, two clunkers -- that's the book on Kuroda so far. He's coming off a strong start in Texas in which he was a tough-luck loser to his countryman Yu Darvish. Nothing about Hammel's fast start appears to be sustainable for the length of a season. But he's reintroduced a two-seamer into his repertoire with great success.
What our culture is suffering from, say Baumeister and Tierney, is a failure of self-regulation, or self-control. Consider how many people struggle with being overweight or in too much debt, to name just two common challenges.
In the awful comedy "Grown-Ups," there's a scene in which Chris Rock is freaked out when Maria Bello breastfeeds her child, who is "48 months," as her husband Kevin James sheepishly offers. I'm thinking that was not a favorite movie of the La Leche League.

If you were lucky enough to see the Houston Grand Opera production that became a modern template for Porgy and Bess - its national tour stops included the Academy of Music in 1976 - you may recall the masterly singing in a production whose staging was solid but far from great. The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess - now its official title under the ownership of the Gershwin estate - is every bit as much Broadway in its elaborate staging and choreography as it is opera.
1. The Cardinals face a major decision on catcher Yadier Molina. With the departure of pitching coach Dave Duncan, Molina is more valuable than ever. He's a great defensive catcher, an improving offensive player, and someone that the pitching staff entrusts as a leader.
Former Sen. Alan Simpson, one of the co-chairs of Simpson-Bowles, said as much when I spoke to him last week. A bipartisan group of 11 commission members -- three shy of the number needed to force a vote in Congress -- supported the recommendations, he reminded me. Dozens of others, Simpson insisted, had offered public support for a debt-relief plan that included tax and entitlement reform.
"Mountains and Sea," her breakthrough in pink, blue and green, set a style that critics — although not universally — have applauded for its lyricism and luminous use of color. Frankenthaler's stain technique influenced others such as Morris Louis, Jules Olitski and Kenneth Noland, giving rise to the Color Field movement of the 1950s and '60s.

Just about every year St. Francis Prep is considered one of the favorites to win the CHSAA Class AA intersectional title. Yet the Terriers have struggled in big games. Until this year. Purificato had the league’s best team, but also pressed all the right buttons and put his players in the best position to succeed. He guided SFP to its first city title since 2006, while juggling the birth of his daughter Carolina.

Philadelphia's scoring play started with some remarkable ballhandling by Michael Farfan, Gabriel's brother, who eluded Heath Pearce and Oswaldo Minda as he dribbled up the right side toward the end line. From there he tried to send a low cross across the goal mouth to Adu. Fortunately for the Union, Riley slid in to try to deflect the pass, only to leave the ball unattended at the left post. From there Adu used his left boot to tap it in.
Police departments across the county have been sent announcements about the program. Any firearm or weapon can be surrendered, but payment will only be made for handguns and assault weapons in working order.
Heath Campbell told The Associated Press last year that he believed the children were taken because officials felt they were in "imminent danger."

The hastily-assembled crowd consisted mostly of the latest class of officers, Newark’s 115th, which graduated in March. It signals the first time during the weeks of tense negotiations between the union and the city that rank and file officers have publicly criticized their own.
Mr. Frye can convincingly argue that he would have taken the plea deal, since he pleaded guilty anyway. Mr. Merzbacher has subsequently claimed that he would have done so, but that isn't believable. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial — in fact, the last words he spoke in court, during his sentencing, were, "I have just one short statement to make to the court, and that is I am innocent." He tried for some years after he went to prison to get a new trial on the grounds that the jury instructions for evaluating the state's burden of proof were insufficient. The state Court of Appeals ruled that they were acceptable. The claim about the plea bargain didn't surface until 1998.

Beltran is not in the lineup for today's 12:45 p.m. game against Pittsburgh and its lefty starter Erik Bedard. Manager Mike Matheny said late Wednesday that he had previously planned to get Beltran this day off. A day game after a night game seemed to be the reason he needed to convince the veteran to rest his legs, take a break, get ready for a month with only one off day, etc.
MORE COLLEGES: The University of Kentucky countersued fired coach Billy Gillispie, claiming it doesn't owe him pay because he never signed a contract. The university filed the lawsuit one day after Gillispie filed his own claim in Dallas, asking for $6 million in back pay, punitive damages, attorneys' fees and court costs.
So let me set the record straight. My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition. Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, almost 90% is controlled by just one company. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down. And it makes it easier for insurance companies to treat their customers badly - by cherry-picking the healthiest individuals and trying to drop the sickest; by overcharging small businesses who have no leverage; and by jacking up rates.

The first book from the site, a limited edition titled "Paper View," is about to be published. The book will feature stories on 25 designers and highlight their studios, homes and inspirations.
But, there's no mistaking that through four days of training camp, the Blazers are in the midst of an offensive transformation. It started Day 1, when the Blazers first worked on their new offense. Instead of featuring a typical 24-second shot clock, McMillan put 15 or even 12 seconds on the clock, and ran the Blazers through a full-court offensive set.

They are a great team. I mean, they are athletic, they get out and run, they push the pace. They have bigs, they have wings and they have a guard who can pretty much do it all. So if we don’t come ready to play, it’s going to be a long night for us.
A good start is the Moving from Ideas to Practice conference Friday at City Hall, sponsored by the city of Cleveland and numerous partners, which will focus on everything from obesity to anti-smoking efforts.
Ending the guesswork. It's tiring work even for a young DIY-er to hold a level while positioning a picture frame for hanging. An array of new levels combine laser precision with suction cups that adhere the level to just about any wall or surface so you can use both hands for something besides holding the level in place. The laser changes colors to let you know when the device is level. Taking it a step further is Black & Decker's Linefinder orbital, which has a dial on the side to let you know the optimum speed for the cut you intend to make. And it comes with a marker you can use to draw on your piece -- but the mark shows up only under the blacklight that's included with the tool.
At least 40 former internees were among the 300 or so people at last month's opening, which brought out officials, politicians and long-buried memories.

At a time when sex is viewed more widely than ever as recreational rather than procreational; when factory jobs have been triple-teamed by hostile environmental policies, overpriced homegrown labor and underpriced illegal immigrants; when we've made a college degree a requirement for just about anything that pays above the minimum wage; and when government policies encourage women to let the state be their mate, why trust a man?

The two gentlemen participated in the conversation, and we dropped it as close as we could to where they thought it was picked up.
When rain interrupts my tennis plans, I struggle to get through my cloud of disappointment. Finding a benefit isn't easy. But if I am willing to engage the question, something positive emerges.

The AWOL drugs tend to have two things in common: They're not pills; they're injected medications, which can be harder to make. And they're largely not brand names; they're affordable generics that have been around for years. That's part of the problem. Because profits on generics are low, their factories are often aging, breakdowns are increasing and quality control may have slipped as suppliers try to cut manufacturing costs. Worse, there's almost no early warning system for drug shortages, and price-gouging is widely reported. Canada is in the same boat.
