Perhaps the winner will be part of the next wave of Garden Island gourmets.

Oscar races, like political campaigns, are often filled with giant opinion swings, many of which cannot be explained, and there's no shortage of recent best picture upsets — "Crash" prevailing over the favored "Brokeback Mountain," or "Saving Private Ryan" losing to underdog "Shakespeare in Love."

That's a shame. There's a certain minimum standard of human decency you can generally ascribe to good parents. And when you're talking about politicians, male or female, there's a higher-than-average chance they might not meet the minimally decent threshold. Reports on Palin's PTA attendance record are important, in their way, as are tales of Biden's Amtrak addiction. Parenting is a window into the character of the people who hold power over us.

Is natural gas cleaner than oil? The only byproducts of burning natural gas are carbon dioxide and water. Natural gas does not produce the complex unburned hydrocarbons that are common in burning oil and its derivatives (requiring catalytic converters on cars and trucks), nor does natural gas produce the sulfur dioxides or nitrous oxides present in coal emissions. Natural gas produces only half the carbon dioxide for the equivalent heat produced by coal and 70 percent of that produced from burning oil. In terms of greenhouse gases, natural gas is definitely cleaner.

Still, it's clear Umenyiora believes he's been promised a new contract or a trade this offseason.

With a new pioneer spirit, I pulled out old vines and, among other benefits, created a new avenue that splits the farm. What a joy every spring as I rediscover the new short-cut on the farm. Who wouldn't jump at such an opportunity in life?

Me, I would have confessed and begged for forgiveness. Not Romney, though -- and herein is the reason he will be such a formidable general election candidate. He concedes nothing. He had seen none of the ads, he said. They were done by others, he added. Of course, they are his supporters, but he had no control over them.

Lotterman (Richard Jenkins), the harried editor, hires Kemp despite his obviously inflated resume and lies about his drinking, which Kemp describes with a straight face as "the upper end of social."

A few years ago I attended an early morning Bible study with a group of women from various denominations, and one morning we got into an interesting conversation about using the Daily Office (a common prayer book) as the basis for a regular prayer routine.

Dowdell had eight points and two assists in 13 minutes, capping an 8-0 Suns start to the fourth quarter with a backcourt steal and layup followed by a jump shot for an 89-78 lead.
We're not flatly opposed to new laws against cellphone use by drivers, but we also realize that alone they won't do much. Americans need to decide on their own that distracted driving is dangerous driving.
Single-day "mini-camps" present another option. "Beach Adventure Camp" at Fairport Harbor Lakefront Park, "Creepy Crawly Critters" at Children's Schoolhouse Nature Park, "Fishy Fun" at Veterans Park in Mentor and a bevy of other day-long adventures await children.

I can't completely ignore tapas, the original small plate, so in the kitchen I'll have plates consisting of chorizo-and-pepper-stuffed potatoes. And my less adventurous friends will love filet mignon skewers. Mexican chocolate brownies with cinnamon whipped cream will be a crowd pleaser for dessert.
The demands underline the erosion of trust between Greece and its creditors in the euro zone. A further meeting of euro-zone ministers is scheduled for Wednesday to finally sign off on the agreement, assuming the package passes Parliament.

DENVER (AP) — The Denver Nuggets figure the way to quit getting beaten inside and out by the Los Angeles Lakers is to get them running up and down the court.
On nice winter weekends, it draws more than 1,000 hikers a day. Or maybe more than 2,000. Droves of people have not always clambered to the top. In fact, hiking didn't used to be such a big deal, said Dottie Gilbert, one of several activists who successfully persuaded Phoenix to preserve its mountain areas, now known as the Phoenix Mountains Preserve.
Dessert includes a sundae ($8) with malt ice cream, whipped maple and candied sunflower seeds that looked too interesting to pass up. It was fine, but not nearly as compelling as if it had been made with chocolate or caramel sauce and toasted pecans or walnuts. Still, I'd score one for creativity.
Palestrina's "Stabat Mater" is a good example of this contrast. A collection of 20 three-line reflections on the grief of Mary, the mother of Jesus, as he hung on the cross, it is sung without pause between sections, and goes from sentiments such as "Make it that I feel the force of your grief" to "Grant that through your Mother I come to the palm of victory."
The 2.1-acre public park, in the shadow of South Waterfront towers, features an open space with a kid-friendly fountain and picnic grounds, landscaped gardens and an area with benches.

We sweated in the July heat and bickered about who wasn’t shucking fast enough, usually my youngest sister.
Gaffney was productive in 15 starts in 2011, with 68 receptions for 947 yards and five touchdowns. He helped out while top receiver Santana Moss was hampered by a hand injury. Much of the production, however, came from Gaffney's connection with his former quarterback at the University of Florida, Rex Grossman.
But Radley Balko, an investigative reporter for the Huffington Post, thinks a chill pill is in order. In a (rather opinionated) three-part series covering the abuse of prescription painkillers, he presents reasons for skepticism. While he certainly doesn’t write off the painkiller problem as a non-issue, he cautions us to beware of flawed data. Here is one such example: “There's also reason to suspect the raw overdose statistics in and of themselves. Dr. Steven Karch, who has written a widely used textbook on drug abuse and pathology, says because tolerance for opioids can vary so much from person to person, there's no scientific way to definitively say that a death was caused by an opioid overdose. "There are plenty of people walking around with levels of opioids in their bodies that would be declared toxic if they were dead on a slab in a medical examiner's office," Karch says. "Toxicology is the least important part of making a diagnosis." In other words, many of the deaths classified as overdoses in recent years may in fact have been caused by something else, but were called overdoses simply because the decedent had what appeared to be an abnormal amount of opioids in his system.”
Babbitt was assigned to the Stampede earlier this season on Dec. 8, posting averages of 18.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 27.3 minutes in four games before The Trail Blazers recalled him on Dec. 18.
In all of 2010, regulators seized 157 banks, the most in any year since the savings and loan crisis two decades ago. Those failures cost around $23 billion. The FDIC has said 2010 likely was the high-water mark for bank failures from the Great Recession.

STATE INCENTIVES
While moguls and the sporting elite planned their multi-million-dollar sports palace, Los Angeles City Hall was ringed with "Occupy L.A." tents. The monthlong demonstration resembled a '60s protest, complete with images of revolutionary Che Guevara, scratchy bullhorns, the backbeat of bongo drums and a tented "People's Collective University.'' It is part of a nationwide protest loosely focused on wealth disparity.
That's a dangerous attitude to take, as all too many people learned last year. Jim Kramper of the National Weather Service forecast office in St. Louis notes that 2011 was "a historic year for tornado fatalities" across the country. Last year's April storms in Alabama come to mind, but most of us remember the May 22 EF-5 twister that roared through Joplin and killed more than 160 people.
"The coaches haven't told me anything yet, but I anticipate eventually moving back into midfield," Nyarko said.
"They can't buy their way out anymore and they're not willing to compromise," said Al-Qahtani, an economics professor and president of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Assn.

convict defendants of capital crimes. Some have sentenced defendants to life without parole rather than impose the death penalty. Some defendants have been permitted to plead guilty to life without parole in exchange for prosecutors agreeing not to seek the death penalty.
Not Times Beach. With confirmation of dioxin, the one-two punch was too much. The last residents were moved by the federal environmental Superfund in 1985. The former town became a state park. The crest of Dec. 6, 1982, almost 24 feet over flood stage, remains a record.

But this is about the future, and the future in professional sports can be a cold-blooded brute. It can crush sentiment and cheap-shot best intentions. It can demand tough choices, but give no guarantees. The past cuts no ice with it.
Parents and teachers attribute the school's strong academic achievement to innovative programs like those created by the MIND Research Institute, in which students learn math through computer games.
The travel cost change brings Oregon's policies in line with states' such as California and New York, which pay their investment officers' travel expenses. Both of those states have endured scandals related to illegal gifts provided to state employees by outside investment firms and third party marketers seeking big investments and the management fees that they bring in.
The orchestra was in magnificent voice, with the many solo parts well-played. Putting the three offstage trumpets in the Dress Circle was an effective touch, making the sound more immediate dramatically as well as acoustically. One of those trumpets was retired principal Susan Slaughter; it was lovely to see retired second harp Ayako Watanabe back on stage, too, as one of a trio of harps.

It's fertile political ground for Obama too. Not only is Michigan considered a swing state in the November election, but he has made several trips to the area to tout clean energy projects, and his administration has provided $2.4 billion in federal grants to develop next-generation electric vehicles and batteries.
NEW YORK -- Forget style, quality and customer service. This holiday season, all that matters is price.
What's been happening over the past few years is that as nonrenewable natural gas supplies dwindle, fracking efforts have become more extreme: drilling is deeper, more fluid volume is forced in, more toxins are used. Thus, with this increased violence, we can expect more earthquakes.
The news comes quickly. Green came quietly.
The most recent anxiety over Italy and Spain comes after banks and other private investors on Greek bonds were asked to take some losses as part of the country's second bailout -- a move that the eurozone had ruled out for most of the crisis and which analysts warn may well be in the cards for other weak European states.
Those estimable forebears, and others, are clearly on her mind. The pieces boast stretches of Chopinesque keyboard figuration - where Auerbach's virtuosity as a pianist comes into play - as well as the tart dissonances of Shostakovich and an allusion to the "Dies Irae" plainchant that seems more like an allusion to the many composers who have alluded to it before her.

Why, then, would we refuse to provide a group of Coloradans with the rights and responsibilities given to the rest of us?

Twenty years ago, another Hawaiian Regional Cuisine co-founder opened shop on Kaua'i, but much to the dismay of his legion of fans, Jean-Marie Josselin closed his vaunted A Pacific Cafe in 2005 to concentrate on his Las Vegas outpost, 808. In May of this year, he returned to the Garden Isle as a neighbor of Merriman's, with a new name for his restaurant — Josselin's Tapas Bar & Grill — and a new focus, "country French, seasonal Provencal and Asian dishes." But they're still made with seasonal, locally produced ingredients, creating a menu that varies daily based on availability.
She evidently got past her disgust. She and her husband, Brad, were among the 3,000 exhibitors manning a booth last week at the Natural Products Expo, the world's largest trade show for health foods, supplements, natural cosmetics and eco-friendly cleaners. Their product, Broo Craft Beer Shampoo, is "pure enough I can drink it," Brad said proudly.
øAnother type of mini-game that uses the rear-touch screen involves pushing the bad Botz out of doors. The screen will show a house with a number of shuttered doors that randomly pop open. An opened door could reveal a Botz, a Deviant or one of the human-like inhabitants. If a Botz is standing there facing you, you get points by poking the spot where he is standing from the rear-touch screen and pushing him out of the house. If he is facing away from you when the door opens, you must push him out by tapping on him from the front touch screen. This whack-a-mole-type game is frantic, as shutters open and close non-stop and you tap both from the front and the back of the device.
"We wanted to show what we are capable of and bring some edgy new stuff to town," Carter said.

Employers and recruiting firms are checking. Block says the Society for Human Resource Management reported that 96 percent of employers perform some sort of reference or background check. They're finding discrepancies not only in education attained but also in previous employment titles and dates, reasons for leaving previous jobs, former job responsibilities and accomplishments, past salaries and other claims. If a job applicant is found out, they're usually terminated before – or immediately after – starting. Wilson says applicants have a short time period in which to dispute the findings of the vendor who performs the MHA Group's background checks but that the applicant may admit their falsification at that time.

Even with relatively slow iPhone sales, Verizon is handily outdoing AT&T, which recruited only 331,000 new contract subscribers in the quarter. The iPhone is AT&T's chief draw, while Verizon has other advantages on its side, like a broader "3G" data network and new, ultra-fast "4G" network in many cities. In the quarter, Verizon sold 1.2 million devices that use the 4G network, including laptop modems and the HTC Thunderbolt smartphone.
Under the agreement, the Vikings will pay the university a fixed fee of $250,000 each game. In addition, the Vikings and university will split money that comes in from concessions, sponsorship and advertising, likely amounting to about $50,000 a game. That plus the rent means the university will take in about $300,000 a game or $3 million over the course of a 10-game NFL season.

While we tend to think of it as a fruit, rhubarb actually is a vegetable, which helps move our brains in the direction of using it in more savory dishes, such as a kale salad. It is not necessary to always combine it with strawberries. Trust me. It's far more interesting to pair its tart flavor with tropical mangoes, chewy figs, fresh raspberries or ripe bananas.

To make: Heat about a tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan on medium heat. Cook 2 thinly sliced carrots, 1 sliced shallot and 2 cloves of chopped garlic until carrots begin to soften, taking care not to let them burn. Add 1 or 2 small zucchinis, cut into small pieces and 1/2 cup chopped roasted red and yellow peppers (I used the jarred ones, packed in water). Cook about 5 more minutes. Add a 14.5 ounce can of white beans, drained, and any herbs if using and cook another 5 minutes. If you like a little more liquid with your beans, add 1/2 a cup vegetable or chicken broth. Season to taste with salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice.
Hane, Lopez and Fischer, plus other officers who had arrived later, headed down the gravel railbed toward the elephant cars. They were armed with tiny white notepads and cameras.

4. Trent Richardson, RB, Alabama. A sidebar to Alabama's crushing loss to LSU was the big blow that result dealt to Richardson's Heisman chances. He was tough as nails against the Tigers, gaining 89 incredibly hard yards on the ground and another 80 as a receiver. But in a 9-6 game with no touchdowns, Richardson obviously didn't have any truly memorable plays.
2009 Vietti "Tre Vigne" Barbera d'Alba, Piedmont ($19-$24): Pour this into a glass and just enjoy looking at it for a bit. It's a deep, vibrantly toned ruby, thick and rich but not opaque. The aroma doesn't disappoint, either -- it's expressive and forward for the wine's age, a lovely basket of tart and ripe red berry. And the taste just seals the deal, balanced and lush with good structure and some terroir. It's a great value. 91 points.

Police cite common factors in all six killings. All the victims worked at small shops near the interstates, mostly businesses with just an employee or two, Senter said. Five of the victims were women and police believe the killer mistook the lone male, who wore his hair long, for a woman. All six were shot in the head. In most cases, a small amount of money was taken, though police said robbery was incidental.

In modern times, Egypt was home to a thriving Jewish community numbering nearly 80,000 in 1945. But after the establishment of Israel in 1948, Egypt expelled its Jews and went on to fight four wars against the Jewish state. Yet Egypt was also the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel.

Scherzer understands this. He also understands that an umpire isn't likely to give him close calls when so many other pitches were nowhere near the strike zone.

"Modding" is far from new in some walks of life -- car enthusiasts have tuned engines and turned factory models into hot rods for generations, with computer tinkerers and gadget freaks following suit. But tinkering has now become an increasingly normal part of consumer life: If you've ever changed a PC screensaver to your own photo, you've taken one small step into the world of modding. And if you've ever been surprised to discover that your desktop littered with icons and application windows looks nothing like your colleague's pristine monitor, you've discovered how customization can make the same program or machine feel very different. (Language sticklers will argue that "modding" is reserved for making a device do something its creators didn't intend, but I think that's too purist. The normal function of devices and programs now includes vastly more range than playing with the TV's contrast knob or tilting your steering wheel.)

The timing couldn't be worse for local sheriff Kyle McLanahan, since election day is almost here. Big, splashy unsolved crimes are bad for the incumbent candidate. Joe and McLanahan have a past, and if it weren't for Nate's possible involvement, Joe would love seeing the sheriff in trouble. But law enforcement resources are spread thin, and Joe and his new trainee, Luke Brueggemann, are drafted to help out.
Offutt said none of them are trash talkers, so that might not come up during the game, but they'll all know the undercurrent. And that diss of Douglass four years ago, does Offutt remember that?

So, the space agency released guidelines this summer on protecting lunar landing sites and artifacts. They call for a 1,200 acre "no-fly" zone around the first Apollo 11 landing site, and final Apollo 17 one.

Any team can get on a roll in the playoffs, and maybe the Wings will. But it's fair to ask: Why should they suddenly be able to win on the road when they only did so 17 times all season, and five of those times required a shoot-out?

The cast is a sturdy ensemble. Robert Downey Jr. remains ineffably cool as the amphetamine-fueled egotist Tony Stark. Here he's humanized in slap-fight dialogue duels with Gwyneth Paltrow as his equally sharp-tongued assistant, Pepper Potts. He also kindles an unexpected bromance with Mark Ruffalo, who brings wry warmth to the part of Dr. Bruce Banner, the Hulk's human proxy. When Ruffalo spouts a mouthful of scientific gibberish, Downey cheers, "Finally, somebody who speaks English!"
