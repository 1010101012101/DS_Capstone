Richard C. Baldwin: Baldwin told voters at a candidate forum last month that they should elect him because he has the kind of "practical experience" now missing from the court.

He's spent the past 11 years as a judge in Multnomah County Circuit Court presiding over hundreds of civil and criminal trials -- everything from drunken driving to murder.

It is also the culmination of a certain revolutionary logic. Since the days of Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, radicals have talked of the "propaganda of the deed" - the use of dramatic, usually violent, acts to inspire the masses and topple the existing order.

The Oklahoma City bombing. And 9/11 itself.

A new wave of houses is going up around the country. Sometimes they look like alien spaceships. Other times they blend so well into the background they're hard to see. These homes are strongly tied to their particular locations—in contrast to decades of architecture that produced identical-looking houses thousands of miles apart. The architects who practice this approach aim to create designs that connect to their surroundings by using local materials and borrowing ideas, shapes and even climate-control solutions from the region's historical structures.

We turn to the letters for special insight into Bishop — and while they reveal much about her craft, there is little of the unifying principle. Bishop lived in New York, Boston, Brazil (for almost two decades, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Key West, North Haven and many other places. Her letters to the New Yorker, as with so many writers of these generations, were lifelines. There is a lot of sheepish back-and-forth about money, frustration over long periods between submission and publication, discussion of punctuation and complaints. In the letters, one feels the natural aristocracy of the writer — a confidence about her worth that only grows as she gets older.
"We're full speed," Kelly said, shrugging off a question. "It was a clean shot. It was one-on-one. People can get taken down one-on-one. I just don't want people diving and leaving their feet, but that wasn't a bad shot at all. That stuff happens in this game."

Slightly more sophisticated readers will notice how cleverly the fox sows dissatisfaction with his seemingly innocent remarks.… Readers who have experience with how difficult even the best relationships can be will admire how Mini Grey hits this tricky nail on the head. Her illustrations contain as much subtlety as her text. Uncannily like marriage (how else do you parse the division of household chores among Dog, Cat and Mouse?), the arrangement contains the seeds of its own misery ("They lived happily. Or so they thought…") but needs a precipitating factor from the outside to lose its balance. A brilliant detail is that the traveling Fox is a salesman for the Winds of Change Trading Company. What has drawn him there? Why does he tap so easily into everyone's dissatisfaction? What catastrophe will bring the three to their senses? And when peace is restored, all readers will notice that, while Fox is gone, the Winds of Change have left their mark.

Gaiman's own story, "The Truth is a Cave in the Black Mountains," is a perfect example of that — a tale of an unlikely duo on a quest for gold in a place called the Misty Isles. You can't help but feel the venerable shade of Tolkien hovering over this story of a wee man's revenge as he and his companion search for a haunted cave on the isle. But the story also has something else: the arc of a novel, that feeling of satisfaction, of getting a full caloric fictional load of incidents and characters in a fraction of the length.

It hasn't seemed to worry most folks. The place seems as popular as ever, with crowds jamming the bar, the small waiting area up front and the newly installed communal table. It seems there's so much goodwill toward the spot - not to mention its house-made beers pumped up from the basement brewery - that even the no-reservations policy, which can mean substantial waits, isn't a deterrent.

Without some broader significance, Einhorn v. Allied Capital would be small beer in the chronicles of modern-day corporate showdowns. There is no lurid scandal here involving drugs, bimbos or $6,000 shower curtains. There is no cataclysmic ending. Allied stock has faded to about $19 in the current credit crunch but hasn't fared worse than many of its rivals. After a long tug-of-war, Mr. Einhorn's initial short sale has proved neither disastrous nor especially lucrative.

It's rarely a good sign when the first question for the general manager after announcing a draft pick is about a felony assault charge. But like everything else Phil Emery did in his first NFL draft as a GM, we'll have to take his word for it that the Bears' due diligence on Evan Rodriguez indicates the tight end from Temple is as coachable as he is versatile and that his transgressions were a byproduct of immaturity and not some self-destructive nature that doesn't get measured at the scouting combine.

These little plates feature an rich range of possibilities -- and some these are real gems. Try the Lobster Nachos ($12), impressive chunks of sweet lobster meat, avocado and corn deliciously tossed in a sweet soy, cilantro and lime dressing. The melange sits pretty on delicate tortilla servers. Or the three lovely little Lamb Lollipops ($12), nicely prepared though a little overwhelmed by a very thick, mustardy gratinee topping. But they are worth ordering if only for the exquisite pleasure of the perfect potato puree and matching madiera "gloss" that accompanies.

Richard Jefferson, Spurs. San Antonio owner Peter Holt was eager to include the clause that allows teams to use amnesty at any point in the new CBA, and the reason is fairly obvious—Jefferson, who is signed for three years and $30 million. The Spurs franchise is at a crossroads and is probably looking to make one last run with Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili. But they were ousted in the first round of the playoffs last year, and if they meet a similar fate this season, it will be time to blow up the roster next summer. So the Spurs can keep Jefferson on board, but if this year is a flop, he can be waived next summer.

Working from the prolific Guevara's writings, screenwriters Peter Buchman and Benjamin A. van der Veen have not attempted to turn a history lecture into drama or to argue (unnecessarily) against injustice.

Cahun and Malherbe, who went by the pseudonym Marcel Moore, lived together on the Isle of Jersey from the late 1930s on, and they were there when the Nazis invaded. The couple engaged the enemy with a witty resistance of prank leaflets — examples of which are on display — and for that the Gestapo sentenced them to death. When the island was liberated a year later, so were they. A self-portrait made after her release shows Cahun defiantly chomping an SS badge between her teeth. Heil that!

Oppenheimer, the JCH spokeswoman, declined to comment about the union's views, saying that she was unaware of them.
DG: This question fits snugly into the discussion above. Potential, position and priority also factor into a player's ranking. Tilson is viewed as a high upside center fielder who will not only progress at that position (a coveted position) but also get priority playing time at in the coming year. He's got attractive speed, good tools for the outfield, and a bat that, yes, had a great tournament at the ideal time. Keep in mind that prospects aren't ranked based on the season they just had. They are ranked based on the player they are expected to become. If we ranked players based solely on their 2011 performance, Miller would still be No. 1, but Adams would likely be No. 2 and a player like Adam Reifer, who was injured, would be left out all together. The rankings would simply be a regurgitation of the stats and not a snapshot of the organization and where it is headed.

Fisher actually started his campaign with a greater familiarity among Ohio voters than Portman, having won elections to the state House and Senate, to attorney general and lieutenant governor, while losing a race for governor. But familiarity clearly did not breed comfort between the electorate and Fisher, who struggled throughout the race to persuade voters not to blame him for Ohio's job losses during the long national recession.
The injuries meant no significant workouts during April and May. I used the down time as an excuse to revert to suspect eating habits, so I figure that's when I added a few pounds.
Plastic-type bags that biodegrade provide another option, promoted in San Francisco as an alternative. But they also have a drawback: If they inadvertently end up with regular plastic bags for recycling, they can ruin the entire batch.

Testifying on direct examination, Tarver said that Young told her at least three different versions of McCray’s killing, and at first, she recalled, he said he was not the person who actually pulled the trigger and gunned down McCray. She also said — with emotion in her voice — that Young had at various times abused her physically, tried to burn down her house, and threatened her life as he held a gun. “I just started praying,” she recalled of the frightening moment.
A small number of white sharks, perhaps juveniles, could be coming into the area to feed on young elephant seals and ending up killing otters, as well, Tinker said. Had the rate of shark attacks remained where it was a decade ago, there would be about 500 more California sea otters now -- around 3,250, according to his computer models. That would be enough to reach the 3,090 population target to remove the otter from the federal endangered species list.

The first stage calls for 1 1/2 clockwise loops around Lake Tahoe, followed by a climb up Highway 267 and the descent toward the finish at Northstar.
Cody Rhodes dominated Kofi Kingston in a short match, but he failed to capitalize on the opportunity to pin his opponent. Rather, Big Show emerged, taunted him with photos of last night's match, and allowed Kingston to hit Trouble in Paradise for the victory. Rhodes looked strong by making quick work of Kingston early on, and the Big Show spot was a fun way to keep their feud going. I expect Rhodes to get a rematch, fall short and hopefully move up the card.
The Bichon Frise possess a thick, wavy coat. Its fluffy white coat needs to be brushed every day. Professional grooming may be needed once a month and can be expensive. They are friendly, affectionate and don't yap much or nip. They also can live well with other pets in the household. The Bichon is prone to suffer from skin disorders that can give rise to unsightly bald spots and skin irritations, which would yield vet care expenses.
At 68, Newt Gingrich enjoys Medicare, the government's single-payer plan, which he supplements with a Blue Cross-Blue Shield plan. Medicare is the plan the Republicans tried to dismantle last year in the House. They would turn it into a fixed premium that would pay for less care over time.

When a new student comes to Palmer, she doesn’t start them singing. Instead, they talk about her four principles they will have to learn: singing is just like talking; you’ve got to have guts; there are three voices in you; and two muscles we use when we sing. “Then we talk about using your talents whether you do music therapy, sing at your parent’s anniversary party or a lullabye to your baby.

All three major U.S. stock indexes sank after a dismal report about bad loans on the books of Spanish banks. The day before, U.S. stocks had soared after Spain held a successful auction of 2-year bonds.
And, in some ways, it will be Cai's first time too — just as it always is for this constantly youth-reliving artist. Because, when Cai strikes that match, he reverts, if only for an instant, to his childhood self, to that innocent moment when he first started playing with rockets.

Is it my imagination, or does Beckham swing a bat that's too big for him? It looks like he borrowed it from Dick Allen (circa 1972). Wouldn't he be better off swinging a lighter bat and choking up a bit and/or take some lessons from A.J. on how to cut down on his swing and make contact? I hope he pulls out of it, regardless. Ed Sikora, Auburn, Ala.
The remainder of Monday's witnesses were carpenters, metal craftsmen, and a landscaper who performed work at Dimora's home. The carpenters testified they received their pay from Pumper, not Dimora.

"Americans like to obsess about ways that people are different," said Wadsworth, a political science professor at the University of Denver.

This new addition to the genre is more "Sister Act" than "Hoosiers" thanks to its setting of the all-female, nun-run Immaculata College. The year is 1971, and Cathy Rush (Carla Gugino) has just gotten married but has no plans to become a housewife, despite the protestations of her NBA-referee husband, played by David Boreanaz of "Bones" and "Buffy" fame. Rather than fill her days with baking pies and dusting, Rush takes a job as the basketball coach for the tiny school, which has no money, no gym, a single ball and a pile of outdated dresses as uniforms.

Trying desperately to slow Brown's momentum, Coakley and fellow Democrats rolled out a fresh round of automated calls to voters from Vice President Joe Biden and from Vicki Kennedy, the late senator's widow. They were targeting voters who propelled Obama to victory in 2008.

White House spokesmen, fresh from championing the "reset" in relations with Moscow, carefully played down the illegals' arrests as a minor irritant. Public trials, which might have thrown enough of a spotlight on foreign intelligence threats to motivate elected representatives to take action, never happened.

The bill was introduced by state Sen. Shannon Jones, a Springboro Republican. The proposal originally called for a ban on collective bargaining for state employees and restricted bargaining at the local government levels.
Both proposals have their pros and cons, but only one would significantly improve the state's fiscal situation for years to come. That's Brown's, which combines a four-year, quarter-cent-on-the-dollar increase in the state sales tax with a seven-year surtax of 1% to 3% on Californians with taxable incomes over $250,000. Although the money from Brown's proposal would flow into a new fund for public schools and community colleges, it would free up more than $3 billion a year to help close the persistent gap in the state's budget.

If you are overweight or obese, there's no argument that your goal should be to get fit through diet, exercise, and slow, steady weight loss.

The European Central Bank promised to provide unlimited one-year loans to the region's lenders through 2013. The goal is to shield banks from poorly functioning short-term credit markets, in which banks are becoming too worried about each other's financial stability to lend money to one another. Germany's DAX jumped 3.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 3.4 percent.
I'm not a believer in the higher-ed bubble theory, which suggests that a college degree isn't worth the money that people borrow to pay for it.

Their eldest daughter, Megan Murphy, was fair-skinned. “People didn’t realize that she was Latina and white,” and expressed hurtful anti-Latino sentiments in front of her, said Nelson.
“Yo!” shouts the menu at Gabriel’s in Ship Bottom. “Come experience the place where South Philly meets LBI.” The deli, which opened three weeks ago, offers old-school Italian sandwiches. The homemade roast pork or Carmen sandwich won’t put John’s Roast Pork or DiNic’s in Philadelphia out of business, but for the Jersey Shore, it’ll do just fine. The hot soppressata sandwich, with sharp provolone, was quickly dispatched for dinner later on. The roast beef could be juicier, rarer. Good bread.

Defense lawyers are hoping to discredit Murrays testimony, and use the state charges against him to bolster the following argument: the only reason the FBI arrested the Hutaree members when they did, they claim, was because the agencys lead witness was spiraling out of control.

But it was television where audiences really discovered Moore — first as Sir Walter Scott's dashing "Ivanhoe" in the late '50s series, then in the ABC adventure series, "The Alaskans," which Moore later described as "my most appalling TV series ever," and as Beau, the British cousin of Bart Maverick on the fourth season of ABC's "Maverick."

Still, without Chavez's constant presence in the media, his successor could lose the October elections. Polls show that Chavez is much more popular than his notoriously corrupt and inept government. In addition, electoral trends in recent years have shown steady gains for the opposition: Anti-Chavez candidates won 52 percent of the vote in the 2010 legislative elections, and got an unexpectedly high 3 million votes in this month's opposition primaries.
May 28: Benefit concert for Griffith Park with Ludacris, Tommy Lee
I agree with Ramsey County Commissioner Tony Bennett, who has been pushing hard for the Arden Hills site, that a referendum would kill the stadium proposal. And if there wasn't a referendum for the Twins' Target Field, which has been such a major success, why have one for the Vikings stadium?
Like a platoon in an old World War II movie, with its crusty yet caring training officer (Terry Kinney), the recruits in their various complexions together equal America. As the series begins, we follow them as they make their individual, cross-cut ways from home to station house, then to the street in pairs to act as "mobile scarecrows" and exchange expository dialogue.
Jordan displeased some establishment Republicans by refusing to get behind the debt-hike deal backed by House Speaker John Boehner, another Republican.

Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he wants to be "actively involved" in trying to persuade the city's public safety unions to agree to contribute to their pensions. Faced with a $15.7 million deficit, city budget officials said nearly 100 police officers and firefighters will be laid off if those workers don't pay the full share of the employee contribution of their Cal-PERS retirement plans. The city would continue to pay the employer share.
What makes Wilson's characters appealing is their willingness to risk uncertainty in order to learn about themselves. They become humbler, wiser and, one suspects, better human beings for doing this. Such is the case in "Mind's Eye," where a college teacher with a sudden health problem accepts his estranged wife's help, or in "The Decline of the West," where two alumni of an ivy-covered New England school recall, from years before, an incident that embarrassed them.
Pared, 30, hugged his brother, along with two off-duty Newark police officers and the half-dozen uniformed Essex County sheriff’s officers there. He even hugged one of the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office investigators who assisted in the case against him. Applause followed as he walked out.

Barcelona is the place to see a wild and wonderfully inventive form of Art Nouveau architecture called modernisme. Catalan architects led by Antoni Gaudi (1852-1926) and Lluis Domenech I Montaner (1850-1923) rebelled against mass production and structures with straight lines by designing buildings with asymmetrical undulating forms, using bold colors and unusual materials. These structures are a joy to behold and clearly illustrate why the world goes gaga over Gaudi and his colleagues.

And on one wall, Brumley's renderings showed more curious details. The first image in Brumley's architectural drawings showed a scene not from Mozart's comic romp, but from Puccini's "Tosca," which concludes with the heroine throwing herself to her doom from a parapet.

"Downton Abbey": Last week, we learned that Matthew's injuries aren't just upsetting for him, they may have implications for the future of Downton. Tonight, World War I is nearing its end, but that doesn't mean things will revert to the way they used to be. Plus, we also heard this week that Shirley MacLaine is joining the cast for Season 3. My reaction: hooray, Season 3! But ... Shirley MacLaine? I fear a bit of shark jumping in jolly old England, but we'll have to wait and see. MacLaine will play the mother of Lady Grantham (which would explain why she's American), and supposedly, this will set up scenes of friction with the Dowager Countess, played by the peerless Maggie Smith.

"It was one of those ones that I had an absolutely perfect number for a 4-iron," Laird said. "It's one of those ones that you almost wish that you don't, and you play a little safer. I hit three or four great iron shots in a row right at the flag and kind of got a little greedy there and tried to fade one in the wind. So that was the first mental mistake I've made all week. If you do that on your 16th hole in the second round, you're doing pretty well."
It’s the 30th year of this original gangster food festival. And the lineup is, not surprisingly, stacked.

Kincaid also said that some prisons are more difficult to staff than others. For example, the highest earner, a prison surgeon who took home $777,423, worked at the High Desert State Prison in Susanville (Lassen County) - which she called "one of the hardest" facilities to staff. That employee did not retire in 2010, she said, but is listed in state documents as receiving a "back pay adjustment."

The area that used to house vendor stalls in the U. City Market in the Loop was consolidated about a year ago into a single restaurant, Racanelli's Cucina, an expansion of the popular pizza parlor that had inhabited a portion of the space for many years. The Cucina was a decent standard pizza-and-pasta joint, but it broke no new ground in the competitive Loop restaurant scene - and it was hindered by its sheer size.
At the cremation grounds, caretaker Buksh took a last look around the crypt before snapping the lock shut.
At its best, the bigger production instilled a sense of romantic nostalgia — similar to the vibe on classic pop crooner records of the 1950s and '60s — on songs that emerged as dreams recalled in a semi-conscious state. Gibbard extended the wistful feelings without his bandmates on "I Will Follow You Into the Dark," turning the folksy ballad into a regal, save-the-last-dance-for-me theme that Frank Sinatra and Nelson Riddle would've been proud to cover.
It's clear, however, that some damage has been done by the more than 3,000 wells in that state alone. Toxic runoff may already be headed to Maryland's waters by way of the Susquehanna River, which flows into theChesapeake Bay.

“Food is always the expendable thing,” says Kathleen DiChiara, executive director of the Community FoodBank of New Jersey. “People think, ‘First, I’ll keep a roof over my head.

Here's the film's official synopsis via the film's official page on Facebook and iTunes: "In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet--or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles. Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins, (Jonny Lee Miller); her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Moretz); and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins (Gulliver McGrath). The mystery extends beyond the family, to caretaker Willie Loomis, played by Jackie Earle Haley, and David's new nanny, Victoria Winters, played by Bella Heathcote."
