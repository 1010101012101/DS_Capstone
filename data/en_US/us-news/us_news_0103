Wyden says the deficit goal can be reached by combining budget cuts with surgical reductions to entitlement programs like Medicare and with an increase in revenue that would come from reforming the tax code.
"The use of the word as it appeared in the media, however, may have had to do with a misunderstanding. While some of the teenagers were in a holding cell, the police reported that they had been laughing and joking and began singing the popular song 'Wild Thing' by rapper Tone-Loc. In the song, doing the 'wild thing' refers to sex, but police may have misinterpreted this, thinking the boys were talking about their own activities and 'wild thing' became 'wilding.' "
“No, because he’s a core guy in our O-line room,” Diehl said. “Obviously, we still give him a hard time about being a Cornell Ivy Leaguer, but he’s a tough guy, he plays through injuries and most importantly he’s one of us, always breaking down film and watching stuff.

Lately I've been listening to podcasts more than music. I try to catch up with This American Life and like The Moth. I love The New Yorker's fiction podcasts in which authors read short stories and then discuss them. Lorrie Moore's reading of Julie Hayden's "Day-Old Baby Rats" in that series stayed with me for a while. If someone is telling me a story, I can work for hours.

Now it was time to test my mettle on the obstacle course. I climbed into the seat of the RZT, a zero-turn model with lap bars ($2,599 and $2,999). I fired up the key ignition and putt-putted toward the course. On the first turn, I pushed the lap bars too fast. The wheels jerked and a cone crunched underneath the wheels.

"Cinema Verite" (HBO Home Video): A fictionalized, behind-the-scenes story of the revolutionary 1973 PBS documentary series "An American Family," which catapulted an ordinary family to fame and gave rise to a new television genre: reality TV. The filmmakers set out to chronicle the life of the Louds, a seemingly perfect family. Once filming began, though, the strain in the Louds' marriage, the ups and downs of raising five children, as well as the criticism Pat Loud (played by Diane Lane) received for asking for a divorce and openly supporting her gay son (Thomas Dekker), came sharply into focus. As the show gripped the nation, the Louds were unprepared for the consequences.
"According to the seedings that was the hardest team," Robinson said after the Washington win. "That doesn't mean anything though, because everyone gets to the semis and then they're playing hard. We've kept our 'one day at a time' mantra, and that's what we're going to do."
Although Mr. Leopold's defenders are apt to seize on those elements of the indictment to paint the entire thing an effort to embarrass the executive, they do follow the pattern of the earlier accusations. In all cases, the charges revolve around Mr. Leopold using county resources for his private benefit. It is the behavior of a king, not a county executive, and Mr. Leopold should be forced to answer for it.
Patricia Krentcil, 44, told CBS News that she has "been tanning my whole life," and "I love to tan." But when asked if she had her daughter in the booth with her she said, "No, not at all. There's no room (and) I would never permit it."

LOS ANGELES - NBA scoring leader Kobe Bryant will sit out his fourth consecutive game to rest his bruised shin.
Left side of line, plus Mack, is fine. Pinkston made strides as a rookie last season. Questions remain about Lauvao’s viability for the long haul, and right tackle screams for a high draft pick. Cousins only is listed as the starter because Browns parted ways with Tony Pashos, who was injured and played poorly last season. If Vikings go against prognostications and pass on Matt Kalil at No. 3, Browns would have a crack at him. Sliding Kalil to right tackle, though, means he would not play the position that is tied to his best value. Right tackles simply should not be going in the top five. At 37, Browns possibly could have two of these three in front of them: Jonathan Martin, Mike Adams and Bobby Massie. If the Browns stay at 4, 22 and 37, and pass on RT each time, Mitchell Schwartz and/or Zerbie Sanders might still be on the board when they pick early in the third round.
By the end of this summer, The Star-Ledger will create a virtual New Jersey Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame on its website, New Jersey Online (nj.com/njrockhall). Readers will be able to go there to learn about the inductees, look at photos and videos, and discuss who should be inducted.

However, as an adult (I would say I entered adulthood, and I use the term loosely, when I got married 7 years ago), I don't mind the rituals that go along with observing the High Holidays. Maybe that's a shout out to my rabbi, or my husband's family who we celebrate with here in St. Louis (my family is in Chicago), or maybe I just grew up. Regardless, it just doesn't seem as much of a chore as it did growing up. Sorry Mom.
Tortorella wouldn’t answer with any depth about the Capitals’ limited use of their star Ovechkin, who played only 13 minutes, 36 seconds in Washington’s win on Monday. Despite playing his fewest minutes in a game in which he wasn’t injured, Ovechkin scored the tiebreaking goal on a third-period power play.
The issue of family loans reminds me of the well-known Shakespearean quote, “Neither a borrower nor a lender be.” The quote is from Hamlet, perhaps one of Shakespeare's most famous plays. In this scene, a father is passing words of wisdom onto his reluctant son before he leaves for gentlemen schooling.
The exhibit shows the growth of the region from 1945 to 2000. The most striking time for Gillahan was the 1960s. The Berea school district built 11 schools then. The city’s population rose from 12,051 in 1950 to 16,616 in 1960 and 22,396 in the 1970s. Berea and surrounding communities then saw a drop in the 1980s, causing the school district to start closing buildings and reducing its teaching staff.

Why they won’t: It was disturbing to see Taylor, with KU up two points and 4:23 remaining, pull up for a 3-point attempt with three UNC players back to guard the lane and none of his teammates to offer support. He missed, and the rebound inevitably went to the Heels. Did he learn nothing from the mistakes of Florida’s Erving Walker? That kind of recklessness will not play well in New Orleans.

Only in Washington could a semantic argument such as this take place and have weight. In the real world, the point of departure is the status quo. So, an increase in existing tax rates would be a tax increase and raise money. Maintaining existing tax rates wouldn't cost a thing. A tax cut would be a reduction in existing rates.

After he died in 1862, childless, his will was contested by his family heirs for 17 years as the house decayed.

Neighborhoods have life cycles. After their initial growth stage, whether neighborhoods thrive or decline depends on whether new residents move in and maintain their homes – or whether owners move out and properties decline. Those decisions will be made, in part, by whether the city also invests in parks, libraries, capital improvements, and public safety, and whether surrounding businesses make the neighborhood interesting.

'I'm trying to get this team to understand that they still have a legitimate shot to win the division. That means more to me than anything.

How it works: Someone claiming to be from the hotel knocks on your door and, finding you in the room, announces that the towels/honor bar/plumbing need to be inspected. They often work in pairs so that as one explains in elaborate detail what's being examined, the other can case the joint to see what kinds of electronics or valuables you have lying around, whisking them into their pockets if they're able to do it without your seeing or simply waiting until they can catch you away.

Roshon is trying to get some of William's mojo, by dressing like him, and putting a poster of him up in the studio, and then gets some salsa tips in the "DWTS" kitchen. The dance floor has been transformed into some sort of prom with a "tropical paradise" theme. Roshon's certainly got the energy for a salsa; he's so fast and his ultra-thin legs remind of the pros you see doing well in Latin competitions. Bruno calls his timing "unbelievable" and Carrie Ann says it was a "mishmosh of beautiful dancing." Oooo-kay. Len wants him to settle down just a bit.

Commercial structures designed before 1993 were not built to withstand earthquakes and according to the codes, it's not until an existing building changes use that it is required to retrofit. A grandfather clause says if an office building in the '20s is still an office building today then the owners aren't required to retrofit, which means that a substantial number of existing structures have not been upgraded.

Yet many of the newly elected Democrats who gave them their majority -- Heath Shuler in North Carolina, a former Washington Redskins quarterback and evangelical Christian who loves to hunt, and Brad Ellsworth, a church-going county sheriff in Southwest Indiana -- campaigned as centrists or even conservatives: tough on immigration, against free trade and culturally conservative.

When I was a keeper at the Los Angeles Zoo years ago, I took care of Jonathan, a 3-year-old orangutan. When I went to check on him one day, someone told me he had a bolt in his mouth. Orangutans are great traders, so I took some grapes in to him to try to get the bolt. While I was inside with Jonathan, people knocked on the window. They'd seen him get rid of it. He had thrown it through the screen when he saw me coming.
The brother and sister often went without food, water or human touch, according to the suit.

Proponents of principal reduction say it would give underwater homeowners -- those who owe more than their homes are worth -- a much-needed break and cut down on the number of more financially costly foreclosures. Opponents say it's not a cost-effective approach and worry about borrowers defaulting just to get the reduction, at least in cases where a program is structured so you must be delinquent for the help.

The largest portion of public services spent on Latinos is for education, according to the report. (That's not a surprise since demographic figures find Latinos as an ethnicity tend to be younger.) One could look at that two ways, according to Sylvia Puente, executive director of the Chicago-based Latino Policy Forum. Yes, it may be major spending, but "it's really an investment in their future and their potential to contribute to the region," said Puente. We're not educating Latinos just so that they can do well personally, but so that our entire local economy can grow with them.

Critics view the groups as essentially an end-run around campaign contribution limits. Colbert — Potter's frequent host — highlighted the loopholes in the system last week when he declared his candidacy for "president of the United States of South Carolina."

Two weeks ago Mayor Sly James and the City Council courageously followed the initial suggestion of City Manager Troy Schulte to trim the department's budget for the new fiscal year by a reasonable 1.4 percent from this year's spending. The result will be fewer firefighters. But the department can make sure this does not reduce public safety. The best way is to not send larger-than-necessary numbers of responders to so many calls, as is done now.

While these findings make sense, it is a case of the chicken vs. the egg: Which came first, a woman's sensual, free walk, or her habit of reaching vaginal orgasm? I think the former. A woman who walks with confidence, ease and a bit of sex appeal is likely more in tune with her sexual needs and her body, meaning that reaching vaginal orgasm is easier for her than for someone who might be more self-conscious and inhibited as she walks down the street. A woman who isn't comfortable in her own skin outside the bedroom isn't likely to be comfortable in the bedroom. She will likely be more inhibited and disassociated from her physical sensations during sex, all of which will complicate the process of attaining vaginal orgasm (which is notoriously harder to reach than clitoral orgasm for most women).

And now, as with all addictions, I love it and hate it in equal measure. And, as with all of life's puzzles, I find that the true puzzle far exceeds the visible puzzle. Why, for instance, should qualities as inane as shortness and vowels get to dictate something as ane as immortality? And why does "inane" get to be a real word while poor "ane" does not? Especially considering insane and sane. As you see, I no longer find crosswords relaxing. Au contraire, they send my bitty brain spiraling.

The area that surrounds clearance racks can feel like an alternate universe: Budgetary concerns and closet inventories seem to evaporate, along with the ability to make rational decisions. The lure of bargains is strong, and can monkey with otherwise savvy, reasonable shoppers. Which is especially unfortunate since many clearance items are final sale, so any unfortunate impulse buys may be irreversible. Here are a few things to keep in mind before you step into the Clearance Zone and risk an ill-informed purchase:

We also chowed down at Beets Café (1611 W. 5th St.; [512] 477-2338, http://www.beetscafe.com). Beets is a "living foods" cafe that serves raw and yummy meals and desserts.
