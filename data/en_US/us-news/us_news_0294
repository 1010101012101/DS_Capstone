Despite the difficulties, the camp is drawing support from all corners of the community, which provides a steady stream of donations -- tents, blankets, clothes, bottles of hand sanitizer and food. This week, a group of union locals, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Amalgamated Transit Union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers rented six portable toilets for the camp. The aging plumbing in the Chapman Square public bathroom has succumbed to the increased use.

That left Ross with only four months to ready the film, half the time he had on the first movie. Ross, a three-time Academy Award nominee for screenwriting, wanted to do a rewrite on Beaufoy's script, as he did on the original "Hunger Games" script by Billy Ray. The second book features a lot more action and will probably require a more elaborate shot list. There has also been speculation that the movie will shoot on location in North Carolina, where the original took place, and possibly Hawaii, to double as the jungle setting in the book.

Outlook: It’s certainly not out of the question that a back that the Ravens really like is sitting there in the second or third round and they opt to pull the trigger. Pead, one of the team’s pre-draft visitors to the Owings Mills facility, has game-breaking speed and would add another dimension to the Ravens’ offense and special teams. The Ravens also could use a power back, like the 210-pound Baker, as a change of pace for the elusive Rice. However, the fact that Rice figures so heavily in the game plan and the Ravens have a history of giving their own younger players, like Allen, an opportunity before looking externally would lead one to believe that they won’t place as high of a priority on the running back spot as they will on other positions. Still, they clearly need to add some depth so don’t be shocked if they come out of the draft with at least one new running back. There are also a handful of relatively accomplished free agent running backs still looking for work, so the Ravens could go that route as well.

We’re arguing that this is illegal under the Bern Convention, the EU regulations. That’s why Norway and Iceland are not members of the EU, because of killing whales. And Europe doesn’t allow that. But the Faroes claim an exemption because they’re a protectorate of Denmark. But what we’re saying is that you can’t be expecting to take subsidies from the EU and then claim an exemption, so we’re putting pressure on Denmark to say: look, you’ve got to comply with the law and stop giving subsidies to your protectorate that’s killing whales. This might be a loophole but we’re going to try and close it.

Coffeehouse Northwest: When you order hot chocolate here ($5), you'll likely be asked: "Have you had it here before?" That's because these baristas are as impressively nerdy about their cocoa as they are about their coffee. The owners spent five months trying different chocolates and salts until they found their ideal combination. The winners? Venezuelan dark chocolate from renowned French chocolatier Michel Cluizel and just enough Portuguese sea salt to round out the flavor. The two are added to milk, steamed into frothy thickness, and served freckled with cocoa powder. Rich, balanced and complex, it occupies that welcome middle ground between ultra-intense drinking chocolate and standard hot cocoa. 1951 W.

Of course, professional basketball isn't a sport; it's a business. In general, winning is a good thing and brings revenue, thus: no conflict. But if winning were suddenly to become a bad thing, the Berserker management would be fiducially incompetent if they did not accept the proposition that, for just this little bit of time, the team should lose games. Management can make that happen just by playing rookies and role-players. The players need not be complicit.

But in Washington, where there is deep respect for the office of the presidency—even among critics of President Barack Obama—there has been a general reluctance to harshly criticize the agency that quietly keeps the president and his family safe from harm.

What you will not find is a discernable plot -- or at least one worth following. The vaguely sinister visitor is Mr. William Hard (Michael Regnier), an emissary from "the land of evening," come to replace Squeezer's dad, Raymond (played by artistic director Clyde Simon), who, it turns out, is a "pneumatic redundancy."
Kyle Orton's 476 yards passing were the second-most in Broncos history, and two receivers — Brandon Lloyd and Jabar Gaffney — had 140 or more receiving yards.
Oil prices notwithstanding, the Blues had plenty of gas against Minnesota. Let's not kid ourselves, the Wild haven't been a difficult bunch to tame in recent days. The loss Saturday was the team's seventh in succession, a skid that includes two losses to lowly Columbus - but let's not go there.
"Consumers who have jobs will continue to spend,'' said Dan Laufenberg, an economist with Stonebridge Capital Advisors in St. Paul. "Consumer balance sheets have improved, and they are not taking on more mortgage debt. With consumers spending, businesses can justify investing.''

Anytime you have an opportunity to play for first place it should mean something. Tonight's matchup with Vancouver presents a good challenge and I expect both teams to be ready to play. The Blues have proven to be one of the stronger home teams in the league and winning tonight will only help their chances of securing home ice once the playoffs roll around. To improve to 5-0 on this trip would be an accomplishment and sitting atop the conference, even if it's for just a day, further shows just how consistent this hockey club has been.

I drew strength from it. I said I'm keeping this. I broke a smile a couple times because it was unbelievable. All of these women were so loud and so awesome.

Such a provision hardly satisfies the likes of Frank Quirarte or Doug Acton, photographers who have skillfully executed countless rescues over the years, or the many surfers who have bailed out tow-partners in trouble. They've had their training, in some of the most horrific conditions imaginable. In the wake of Trette's near-death experience, "I'm hoping NOAA will loosen up its stance," said Quirarte, "and be more receptive to a qualified, organized volunteer rescue team when Mavericks breaks."

In the third Harrell got into some trouble when the Condors (18-16) leadoff hitter doubled down the third base line to start the inning. After a sacrifice bunt put the runner at third, just 60 feet away from taking a lead, Harrell struck-out the next hitter to get the second out of the inning.
"There is no perception of political motivation except for the one you created by choosing to raise it with reporters," Yost wrote on campaign letterhead (and with the tone that makes him susceptible to charges of grandstanding himself).

Some people hunt eggs, but I prefer to eat them. As a kid, I thrilled more to the feast than the hunt — as in the feast of hard-boiled eggs and leftover egg dishes that remained in the wake of annual visits from the bunny.
Roy is a star. He's going to do his thing. He'll lead. Most of his teammates will follow. But it's the glue players in between that matter most in a season like this. In prior years, there's been a calm in the locker room. But that's been replaced with a peculiar feel that surrounds this team -- one that has caused those around the team to observe that "something's not right."
"Going into high school, I will be honest, I wasn't the greatest player," Conroy said. "Coach Vitello is all about individual skill and he shaped me up.

I think the show can be a powerful vehicle for your beliefs and ideals, but this dance fell flat. The two were out of sync the entire time. They looked stiff.

Ravens director of player personnel Eric DeCosta mentioned South Carolina's Alshon Jeffery as the sort of tough receiver who could make plays on the outside. At just under 6-3, Jeffery lacks top-end speed but has played effectively at nearly 230 pounds. He could be an option if the Ravens wait until the second round. Appalachian State's Brian Quick, another lanky prospect with upside, is also considered a second-round talent. He left school as the all-time leader in catches, yards and touchdowns but claims he rarely received positional coaching. He also played only one year of high school football and is considered a project.

We may have said, at first, where did that come from? But the answer was there in the death of Anna Draper (Melinda Page Hamilton), the widow of the real Don Draper, Dick Whitman's Korean War commanding officer.

Lazy people exist in all employment sectors and social and economic strata, and it is counterproductive to label an entire group as such. Ask anyone if there is a lazy person at his place of employment; the answer is bound to be yes. There are lazy CEOs, lazy middle-class workers and lazy poor people.

These days, summer beer means more than just wheat beer. It can mean a crispy, hoppy pilsner like Sierra Nevada's. It can mean a nutty, caramely copper-colored cream ale like Anderson Valley's Summer Solstice.

But browsing also provides a place to meet. Browsing brings people and ideas together. Book stores--especially those wonderfully rare independent booksellers-- provide a place to talk with others. You can digest ideas better when eating a scone and drinking a coffee. Trust me. But if the trend is away from browsing places to virtual stores, where will we meet? What is the shape of community is this new era?
Ramon Sessions, traded to the Los Angeles Lakers at the March 15 deadline, was a luxury for a team headed back to the draft lottery. Irving, the presumptive Rookie of the Year, probably will average 34 to 36 minutes next season. That means his replacement will earn 12 to 14 minutes per game.

Abramoff was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in 2006, eons ago in Washington time. He is out of prison and speaking about his new book.
Most of the time Aaron and I are talking about whether something is compelling, rather than the best program to make it with. The question we're most often asking ourselves is, "Is this good, and if it is, how do we make it better?" The more I learn from a technical standpoint—whether it is film stocks or camera lenses or compositing software—just means more tools, more paints in your palette as a director. I think Aaron comes from the other end of the spectrum. He's very thoughtful and intelligent and articulate when talking about scenes and ideas and stories; he's not coming at it just from a computational standpoint, and I think we're meeting somewhere in the middle.

Oddly enough, she was dressed in a futuristic garb with Saturn-like shoulders, the kind only a man's man like Ace Frehley would wear. Adam now dubbed Juliet "the one to beat." Christina quickly makes it about her again by saying, "I sing from me, and that's where you sing from, too." I went into this show a Christina Aguilera fan and damn it's getting harder by the minute to like her.

Don't buy too much. The benefit on a long-term care insurance policy is generally structured as a fixed daily amount over a certain period up to a cap. You can typically start the clock on the benefit and begin to access the dollars when you have a "long-term care event," such as breaking a hip or having a stroke, in which doctors expect you to need help with the tasks of daily living for at least 90 days. Kenyon said that many salespeople will try to sell you a policy designed to cover the cost of several years of nursing home care, which averaged $239 a day for a private room in 2011, according to an annual MetLife survey. But you can get a much more affordable policy by structuring a benefit package that also includes time with a home health aide, at $21 an hour nationally by the same survey, or adult day care. In some cases, just 10 to 15 hours of respite care a week can be enough to allow people to remain in their homes.

The proposed office building has been treated by the mayor's office as simply a necessity of the Exelon merger with Constellation Energy.

Did the Midland theater change the date of the Roger Daltrey Tommy' show at the last minute? asked one caller. I've had my tickets for weeks, and they say right on them that it's Friday night, the 14th.

I can't believe they'd change the show at the last minute and leave all the ticket-holders needing to change their plans. I don't know if my babysitter can change. I'm hoping (The Star) just messed it all up, because this is way too much trouble if not.

I've worked in the technology industry for more than a decade now. My engineering days are behind me, and I'm learning a new set of skills in leading the team at Elemental. Once again, the environment that Jobs created at Apple is a guiding light. We are working hard to build a culture that will allow us to hire new people at a steady clip while maintaining and strengthening the core values with which we've attained our modest level of success so far. It's been a challenge, to say the least. Yet a friend of mine recently interviewed for a position at Apple, and during the process was told that the only goal for each employee is "to make the platform cool." That's it; so simple, yet so effective. This mantra permeates everything Apple creates, from the lovely devices themselves to the shimmering operating system to the elegant packaging, even down to the environmental impact statement on Apple's website.

Just over eight months ago, Weaver signed a new contract with the Angels worth $85 million. A consensus emerged the Angels landed an ace at a bargain price, that Weaver could have earned even more money had he challenged the free agent market.

The filmmakers of Spielberg's generation wanted to take over Hollywood and change the face of an art form. And for a brief period, until the blockbuster syndrome kicked in in the mid-'70s, they did just that. Along with Lucas, Spielberg is often blamed for shutting down the renaissance, as if without "Jaws" and "Star Wars" it never would have occurred to anybody in Hollywood to come up with high concepts and saturation marketing.
