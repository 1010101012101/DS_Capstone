The lowered hopes come after Monday's dramatic rescues at the Wangjialing mine in Shanxi province.

We discovered one more downtown gem in the South Park area later on our trip: the exotic poolside bar at the Moroccan-themed Figueroa Hotel on South Figueroa Street. With its lush silk drapery, twinkling lanterns and plush couches and tables, it's a dreamy Arabian Nights getaway in the heart of thc city.

With "Moneyball," that strategy delivered a winning moment with critics as well as moviegoers (the movie has pulled in $103 million in worldwide box office). The story, based on the 2003 nonfiction book by Michael Lewis, follows the rebel path of Beane, a failed player who makes his mark in the sport by working with a shy Yale-schooled statistics guy (Jonah Hill) who doesn't know baseball traditions (or its haughty clubhouse mentality) but can find the truth hidden in the numbers.
We remained poor cousins (at one point, near-bankrupt ones) for more than a decade, then proceeded to get mean.

Reading the work of a 95-year-old author is humbling, especially if parts of his book are unfathomable, not because the author is past his prime, but because Martin Gardner once wrote the Mathematical Games column for Scientific American magazine. The chapters devoted to such games were off-limits for this reader.
In a note to clients, Cowen and Co. analyst Ken Cacciatore said it is difficult to get a handle on Actavis' results because it is privately held, but he said the company may be on pace for revenue of $2.9 billion to $3.05 billion in 2013, and it could add 70 cents per share to Watson's annual profit. Cacciatore wrote that about 70 percent of Actavis' revenue comes from international markets where Watson does not do much business.

While countless comedies have used the interview format for parody, "Between Two Ferns" has its own unique rhythm. Galifianakis may be satirizing vacant, unknowing celebrity interviewers who use the opportunity to elevate themselves. But much of its appeal is simply as an unfiltered vessel for Galifianakis' brand of comedy -- a mix of gleeful antagonism, perfectly-timed pratfalls and absurdist irreverence.
Despite its compassion and generosity of spirit, "In One Person" probably isn't the best gateway into John Irving's body of work. For that, the clear choices are "Garp," "Cider House" or "A Prayer for Owen Meany." Still, it's an admirable undertaking, evoking the spirit of his literary hero, Charles Dickens, to examine a serious social issue without losing sight of the truth that those ultimate questions are rooted in the everyday world of living, breathing people.

Owner Monique Siu had been thinking about the "evolution" of Castagna after the departure of co-founder/chef Kevin Gibson a couple years ago, and, more recently, the departure of chef Elias Cairo. Despite the changes, Siu says Castagna will hold fast to its philosophical roots emphasizing seasonality and clean, clear expressions of great ingredients. Lightner agrees. What makes Mugaritz great, he says, is not so much fancy gadgets or clever techniques as it is the "refinement of simplicity" -- the ability to highlight the purity of excellent ingredients.

“Once,” a modest romance set amid the Dublin music scene, led all comers with 11 nominations, including best musical, direction of a musical and three acting nominations.

Both shows went on to win best musical.
A good tortilla is more than just a vessel to convey meat, onions, cilantro and lime to your mouth.

At La Superior, they are just as they should be: soft in your hand, but thick and chewy between your molars.

No, Ricky Martin hasn't hit the top of the Billboard Hot 100 since "Livin' La Vida Loca" in 1999. But he's been a regular visitor to the upper reaches of the U.S. Latin chart; "Tal Vez," "Jaleo," and the Grammy-nominated "Tu Recuerdo" all reached #1. "Almas De Silencio," his last Spanish-language album, and his MTV Unplugged session both topped the Latin list, too. All of this is to say that the former Menudo heartthrob remains a big star -- and one whose soon-to-be-released ninth set "Musica + Alma + Sexo" is likely to arrive amidst a flurry of hype. "Lo Mejor De Mi Vida Eres Tú," the lead single, is already shaking up the Latin airwaves. So if you want tickets to his upcoming show at Prudential Center, act fast.

Family dinners can serve up drama and comedy, but they're rarely as fraught or funny as when Mrs. Doubtfire (Robin Williams) insinuates herself into his (we know, the pronouns are confusing!) ex-wife's birthday party so she/he could torpedo the new boyfriend with a pepper-laced entree. What's really true about family dinnertime is that sharing a sit-down dinner three or more days a week can transform everyone's health and brighten your children's future. If lowering blood pressure and reducing cancer and heart disease risk isn't incentive enough, consider this: Dishing up dinner will improve your family ties; boost your kids' health, self-esteem and grades; and rev up your love life. Pass the broccoli, please!

K. tried anything and everything to make it right, to make our little marriage hold. Pride wounded, furious, cruel, I turned her pleading humility to my advantage -- she could never be right, always I had the high ground. I refused to forgive her, though I told her I did, time and again, only to push her into it again, slash at her in the way I knew to hurt her. I pushed her away.
“I immediately communicated with Hal Steinbrenner, Randy Levine (and others). Paramedics were called to the scene. He was taken to the hospital.

— "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968): Stanley Kubrick at his visionary finest. My dad took me to see this when I was about 9 and I was changed forever. Kubrick's visceral and prescient take on such themes as artificial intelligence, extraterrestrials and their role in human evolution was adapted with novelist Arthur C. Clarke from one of his short stories. From the astonishing first act at the dawn of man to the hallucinatory, largely non-verbal climax, the film takes more risks than any 10 studio films made today. I watch it over and over and always experience something different.

Pages 3-16: Portland Police Detective Mark Slater said his sergeant on the homicide detail, Rich Austria, called him at his home around 3:30 p.m. March 22 and dispatched him to Hoyt Arboretum. Slater described for the grand jury some of the procedural tasks that officers accomplish at a shooting scene, including a "round count" to determine how many shots had been fired. The answer, he said, was four. Slater described the contents of a series of still photographs from the scene, including the blood-spattered restroom where Collins apparently had been cutting himself with a knife before he was confronted by police. Slater held up one photo showing Collins' body on the ground, in a fetal position, with plastic restraints around his wrists, and said that securing someone in that way was standard protocol in officer-involved shootings. One juror asked about that procedure, and the detective replied, "By the time the officers were able to approach him, take him into custody, at that point, they did not know if he was deceased or not."
Cook without stirring for about 7 minutes or until the bottom of hash is browned and has a crust. Break up the hash, mixing the crust back into the meat-potato mixture; repeat twice as crust forms on the bottom. Add additional stock 1/4 cup at a time as the mixture starts to dry.

A reminder to Parker and like-minded friends. The tea party moniker is short for: Taxed Enough Already. Those elected under that moniker committed themselves to a reduction in government spending and thereby the deficit. They are doing what the majority of American voters expected them to do. Not like those who go along to get along.
In December 1972 the FAA issued an emergency rule requiring all passengers and carry-on bags to be screened by metal detectors or searched by hand.

In my nearly 40 years running large components of successful businesses, I would never approve such an action with these negative consequences on quality services, and based entirely on a lack of data to support such an action.

Arda: Who expected the response from the audience that Daniel Bryan has received since WrestleMania? In what could – likely, should – have been a career burial, Sheamus beats Daniel Bryan in 18 seconds at WrestleMania, but once again, all eyes are on Bryan going into the title rematch with Sheamus. Fans have responded with chants of "YES!” making it as popular as "WHAT?" If anyone got hurt by the 18-second match at WrestleMania, it's Sheamus. Bryan has truly carried the lion's share of interest for me in this program. Unfortunately, for that very reason, I see Sheamus holding onto the gold, even though many fans might feel that Daniel Bryan deserves to win. Perhaps the match starts with another quick fall, like at Mania.
interest in the Travel Channel and Food Network lately, I have wanted to become more adventurous with my cooking.

That's appropriate, but we would urge Mr. Schurick to go one step further. Mr. Schurick's offense was specifically against the right of franchise in those two jurisdictions, and he should tailor his community service to undo that damage. The robocall had no immediate practical effect in that it did not prevent Mr. Schurick's candidate from losing in a landslide. But it did feed cynicism about the political process. That is a harm that Mr. Schurick can and should use his 500 hours to address. He could spend the time helping people to register to vote, volunteering as an election judge or speaking to community groups to explain why voting is important. Then he might learn just how ridiculous it was for him to lament that campaigns from now on will be "bland," and he might learn just how that robocall sounded on the other end fo the line. It wouldn't restore his legacy, but working to increase the voter turnout he once tried to suppress would be a fitting sign of devotion to the political system to which he had dedicated his life.

Sheridan said that the words and actions of Justice Department lawyers since the release of the profiling allegations have contradicted some of the agency's written and public statements. Sheridan said Austin's reference to the need for a "culture change" in the Sheriff's Office, and the characterization of Arpaio's office as the most egregious example of racial profiling in U.S. history, stand out in the minds of the sheriff's representatives.
