We've got to get that focus back and we move on, rather than thinking about what's going on in a different building that we can't control."
The trail is sandy, fairly level in most places and very easy to follow as it leads through thick stands of manzanita, yucca, juniper, oak and, as you ascend, large ponderosa pines. There are even a few sycamores along the wash.

The takeaway: Antoine Young is the lone senior starter, and he scored eight of his 14 points in overtime to help Creighton win the MVC title against Illinois State, 83-79. "We are a team. No single individual brought us to this day," said Doug McDermott, the conference player of the year and tournament MVP. Creighton is making its first NCAA appearance since 2007. Coach Greg McDermott, Doug McDermott's father, took Northern Iowa to the NCAA Tournament in 2004.
That logic was flawed, of course. The Royals (or any other MLB team) have never shared the rights to New Jersey the way that the A's once shared rights to San Jose and Santa Clara County. Also, the Yankees did in fact permit the Mets to become New York City neighbors as an expansion team in 1962. Danger was avoided. No lives were lost.

It's easy to see how these problems can compound. If you're deep in debt and you lose your job, you probably will have to deplete your meager retirement savings just to make ends meet.

A critical debate about mass incarceration is not about avoiding personal responsibility or accountability. Inmates like Woods, for example, advocate restorative justice programs that enable prisoners and ex-prisoners to give back to their communities.

Acquiring Kingway would give either brewer a leg up in Guangdong Province in Southeastern China, where the brewer is based and sells about 9 percent of all beer. Right now, A-B InBev has more market share in Guangdong than any other brewer, but with the addition of Kingway, Yanjing would catapult ahead.

While China has many churches, they are required to submit to state supervision. That long ago sparked what is called the house church movement, in which members typically meet in people's houses or in larger meetings spaces for services that are technically illegal and otherwise resist government interference.

2. Bynum overcomes slow first half. Consider the first and second half discrepency in points (six, 19), field-goals (two of six, eight of 11), rebounds (six, 12) and turnovers (three, 1). Bynum appeared aggressive throughout the game, but it clearly looked like the 49 minutes he logged in the Lakers' double overtime victory Tuesday over Memphis caught up to him. He appeared incredibly slow in reacting to double teams. Bynum made desperation passes that hardly hit the intended target. He didn't appear as strong finishing. In the second half, that all changed, where he connected on a few lobs and even sprinted baseline for a reverse. In seasons past, Bynum wouldn't handled fatigue as well as he did against New Orleans.

What changed: With the rain pouring down, slopping up the field, the conditions only encouraged the hapless 49ers offense to run the ball even more. Completions — to receivers, especially — were at a premium. However, with Iupati banged up, injuring his ankle when running back Kendall Hunter fell on him, that made getting Frank Gore and Hunter their touches all the more difficult. Iupati returned, but was injured again before the quarter was over. He was seen limping during several points in the game, which is obviously no way to be facing off against the most feared front four in football right now.

A well-intentioned analytical fad has become a plague, epidemic. On SNY, YES, ESPN, TBS, MLB Network. Was that a splitter or a two-seamer? Did the batter, a .268 lifetime hitter, swing late or was he really trying to “go the other way.” Are his hands set too low, too high?

Leave those kind of sartorial shenanigans to Ballas, MacManus. Standing O in the ballroom for Gladys and it's taking a while for the crowd response to die down. Bruno's standing and calls Gladys a star. Carrie Ann is moved to dance and then lean across the judges' table in a way that really messes up her microphone. It's how you know it's live tv, folks!

øCantwell said he was so sure he had the job that he began to recruit high school players for Kennesaw State and that Papp knew Cantwell was recruiting on behalf of KSU. If that is true, it is an NCAA violation for a school to use a non-coach, non-employee to recruit student-athletes.

That doesn't sound like a bubble to me. That sounds like a vibrant market for innovation.

Asked what it was like playing at Western Oregon, Slowey told the Bay Area media, "It's different, Division II. Real small school, we only have about 12 scholarships, so it's nothing like probably any of the other guys that I'm going to be coming in with in San Francisco. You learn to work hard, real blue-collar mentality up here. Everything you get is with hard work, so I think that's going to be a big help for me at the next level."

"As player you don’t really care what the score is as long as you’re on top. It’s one of those things where you’re seeing what’s going on around the league in other series. You kind of have an eye on it. But at the end of the day, we’re not going to lose a game or win a game 6-5, it’s pretty safe to say."

The experimental Russian director, who has staged the avant-garde 90-minute piece in French and Russian with English supertitles, concentrates on the eye and the brain here, instead of the heart. Nobel laureate Ivan Bunin's melancholy tale of love lost and found takes the form of a postmodern montage of Paris. It's an ephemeral dream of last romance, which floats from lovely to surreal without ever reaching the emotional depth an audience might crave.
Gribbon will have a very busy year and sounds thrilled about it. But even before she comes, she will have had an impact. Her decision to come to Cleveland is a reminder that, despite the loss of Timothy Rub to Philadelphia, the museum's ability to attract major-league talent is undiminished.

Entrées come with two sides and cornbread. The biggest seller is fried chicken ($6.49, ¼ chicken, dark meat; $7.49, ¼ chicken, white; $8.99, ½ chicken) and again, there's only a thin crust of batter (secret ingredients here, too), so you're eating juicy chicken, not fried flour. The turkey is the same thick, hand-carved as the sandwich and served with a good, light gravy. I didn't try the smothered pork chop ($17.99) or the hand-battered shrimp with Cajun spices ($14.95), but I'd return for the brisket, catfish or fried chicken anytime.

It won't come from Schaeffer, whose few ideas aren't even brought to full fruition. The ghostly chorus girls haunting the theater in Gregg Barnes' fantastical outfits are a nice touch, but they're underused. And when the fantasy-driven "Loveland" sequence hijacks the second act, it should transport us to a different realm, not a gigantic potpourri from Laura Ashley.

You know, I benefit from the explosion of reality programming, nonfiction programming. The past five or six years I've had a very busy career. And I manage every four or five years to put out a longform documentary. But those subjects are harder and harder to raise money for. When I did the original Paradise Lost, the budget was $1.1 million for two and a half hours. Paradise Lost 3 will be not as much money and not as much screentime.

One of my favorite moments from the three days occurred during one of the many periods I spent hanging out with fans outside the team's hotel. Dave Wallace, a high school teacher from Vancouver, swung by en route to a trip to Oregon for a brief glimpse of his heroes, leaving his wife and two children in a parked car nearby. When Wallace's absence extended, his family eventually appeared.

5. Jewelry: Forget the diamonds – give me vintage jewelry every time. I love rings, earrings and necklaces that are people-stoppers – the ones that make people stop and admire your baubles. I have one piece, a quarter-sized white daisy necklace, that I get compliments on every time I wear it. I paid $6 for it at Cawman’s Mall Antiques and Things in Quinton. I really love the earrings from the ‘50s and ‘60s. Most of them are clip-ons, but don’t let that deter you. Many of them can easily be converted to post earrings after a little DIY.

The biggest savings could come by simplifying the criteria for calculating permanent disability compensation for injured workers, the 2009 report said.

Wood bats meet the safety requirement, but the cost of replacing broken ones makes them a non-starter.
All this gas is the natural product of fermentation, created as yeast transforms sugar into ethanol. For centuries, though, winemakers treated so much CO2 as a hazard that, unvented, could make their wine bottles explode. The original developer of champagne is lost to legend, but an innovative 17th century Benedictine monk named Dom Pierre Perignon is sometimes credited with pioneering the predecessor of the wire collar, called a muselet, which holds a cork in place to withstand the fermentation pressure. With that simple twist, he turned a gassy nuisance into a luxury industry that last year sold about 322 million bottles of champagne world-wide.

Because Whedon's dialogue is less glib than the Marvel norm, with lines written as if they meant something, not to mention often being genuinely funny, the total effect brings the film closer to the tone of the original 1960s books, which revolutionized the comic world by presenting superheroes who were deeply involving, troubled individuals.
"When older women come up to me and thank me for opening a theater that puts the focus on women," Kilburn says, "it feels that we're doing the right thing. But it's very hard.

"It's an especially fitting song because it does coincide with Memorial Day," said Christy, a self-employed insurance agent with grown children. "To me, it shows a callous disregard for American heritage (by not allowing the song to be played). When it is sung at a graduation ceremony, it serves to remind us of the sacrifice of soldiers.

Meanwhile, little effort is made to address the strong correlation between socioeconomic status and student achievement in the U.S.

I make accessories; I take things apart and put them with other things. Nothing that I'm wearing came this way. My T-shirt is from American Eagle. Big stripes and bold colors are really in. I love hats. I shave my head; it's so easy. I made the white wrap bracelet, and I carry this bag everywhere.

Both of her statements are disappointing. Trayvon’s heart-broken mother is grieving, but her grief has not endowed her with ESP about Zimmerman’s motives or state of mind, or the chain of events on the night in question.

The SRT8-only steering wheel has a flat bottom and paddle shifters. Sport mode does a great job of controlling the transmission automatically, so I didn't feel the paddle shifters were necessary.

The Romans changed it slightly to Hispania, which evolved into the present España, which we call "Spain."
Santorum did not mention Friday's revelation that he stands to lose more than a quarter of Ohio's delegates because he filed incomplete delegate slates in six of Ohio's 16 congressional districts.

Under terms of Article 10.2 (iii) of the CBA, the Rangers are required to offer the impending Zuccarello a two-way contract in order to retain his rights when his contract expires following the season.

You will not eat just moles, although you could. There is a kind of mole appetizer, small dishes of several moles arranged around a stack of those green tortillas. It is a mole party on a plate, untainted by chicken or meat: a pounded peanut pepian tinted borscht-pink with beets; a sweet mole flavored with mandarins; a tart mole made with tequila; a dark, oddly sugary coffee mole; or an herb mole that is luridly green. You could compare Camacho's Oaxacan black mole with her mellower mole poblano; with the spicy, smoky manchamantales, (tablecloth stainer); or with her signature mole de los dioses, which has a funky, toasty hint of what I believe is corn fungus, huitlacoche. Is the sauce of poblano chiles with slightly underripe strawberries or the sauce blasted with the Oaxacan spirit mezcal technically a mole at all? We will leave that for the scholars to decide.
