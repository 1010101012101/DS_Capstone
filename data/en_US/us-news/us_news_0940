The loss of the Constellation headquarters, then, is no reason to panic, but it does present a good opportunity to take stock of the region's potential and opportunities for economic growth. Although no Baltimore-area companies are on the Fortune 500 now, Legg Mason was just a few years ago, and it could be again. Among up-and-comers, Under Armour has a shot at the Fortune 500 someday. Its revenues last year were about $1.4 billion, well short of the $4.4 billion earned by No. 500 on the list,Seaboard Corp., an agricultural products company headquartered in Merriam, Kan., which is near Kansas City. But given the athletic apparel company's phenomenal growth rate (its revenues increased by more than 38 percent last year), it could crack the list before the decade is out.
"It was almost lifeless out there," McMillan said. "That's not the team I've seen."
KB: It crossed my mind, maybe a little bit. (laugh)
A. It all gets down to training. What really is courtesy and treating people well? I like common courtesy. I'm constantly saying things like, make sure patients have a magazine and families are informed. We've got a lot of great people working here, but unfortunately even they don't always treat people with as much courtesy as I'd like. We try hard but we are not perfect. And that's something that bugs the heck out of me.
Conservatives from the Republican Study Committee wanted budgets to balance more quickly than Ryan proposed, and did so with deeper spending cuts. The RSC budget, also up for a Thursday vote, would balance in 2017.

"We have a plan in place for Bryce," Rizzo said by conference call. "Losing hitters like Michael Morse (lat injury) and Zimmerman for an extended time expedited this move.

During World War II, the church basement and auditorium became a service center for the military, holding dances and other social events for 450,000 servicemen.
That loud chorus of "Duh!" you just heard came from the many leading economists who have been screaming at political leaders for years now that we'll never cut our way out of this economic slump and instead must grow our way out. It is obvious that deficits, debt loads and entitlement spending have to be brought under control -- but equally obvious that the necessary adjustments should be made when the economy is going great guns, not when it's gasping for air.
The feds went after the biggest slugging name in Bonds and the biggest pitching name in Clemens. That convictions were unlikely because even the most unlikable defendants are afforded the constitutional protections and evidentiary safeguards is not a bad thing. Turning a blind eye to drug cheats, for one, is surely worse.

Professor Vatz is supposed to be an instructor of political rhetoric at a state-funded university. Yet he is such a blind partisan for Mr. Ehrlich that he can't grasp the abomination the Ehrlich campaign has perpetrated against people of color.
With more time, we would have soaked at Ainsworth Hot Springs (about 30 miles northeast) and caught the free ferry at nearby Balfour (a 35-minute ride across the lake to Kootenay Bay). But we did ride an antique streetcar along the Waterfront Pathway to Lakeside Park, where you'll find an organic concession stand (summer only) and busy playground. Downtown, we shared a good but pricey brunch at BiBO, followed by a great (and pricier) dinner at the All Seasons Café, Nelson's top restaurant. Uptown, I took a ride on old BNSF railroad track that has been converted into a mountain-biking trail.

Lynn had a solid college career, but his senior season was marked by a concussion — after which he was carted off the field and missed a few games — and a calf injury that hobbled him in the Senior Bowl and NFL combine. He went undrafted and weighed his options. That's when the Jets called.

Every time he has went to work and pulled any of these things, we have went to work and put in a kick, but every time we have went to work and put in a kick he has went to work and did it again.

Exactly how far has the election sunk? On Sept. 8, The Times published an article detailing the leaked audiotape.

"For me personally it might be harder than anybody else," Staroselskiy said. "I still feel young. I can still work."
They just can't miss almost all of them. Especially Buford. That's far from a revelation. Buford's 2-for-16 against Kentucky helped bounce Ohio State in the Sweet Sixteen last season. All the Buckeyes needed then, and now, is more like 4- or 5-for-16. After Saturday, I haven't changed on whether Buford will provide that when it's needed most -- I still have no idea.
Wooden built championship teams when he had to practice in dingy second-floor gyms in between the Greco-Roman wrestlers, the trampoline gymnasts, the girls in leotards, and even the glee club practice and the pompom girls. He played in Venice High gyms, on City College parking lots and at auditoriums built for auto shows, not zone presses.

The City-County Council will consider a resolution Monday that would pave the way for moving the horses to the fairgrounds, located at 7300 E. Troy Ave., Indianapolis. A new equestrian facility would be built at the fairgrounds before the move, which could happen within 18 months, Lake said.

Event 3 Men Hammer Throw
Gardens based on a one-color-only scheme are chic and straightforward, but I find them just a tad bit quiet and predictable. (Am I the only one who gets bored by endless clumps of Nikko Blue hydrangeas ringing every other house?) An undeniably simple and pretty garden is a pleasure, but is there enough passion in a landscape composed of a single tone?

different things to people. There are things that could make you laugh so hard you will cry, while others stare in disgust, or even concern, such as in the case of someone falling down. Admit it, you fight the urge to laugh to ask the person if they are okay, don't you? Why do you think people enjoy viral videos so much? They can laugh out loud without forcing their way through fake concern. It's

Economists say roughly 6 million older homes need to be sold each year to sustain a healthy housing market.

Dziczek said she still expects the contract to pass, despite the early losses.

Newman. That’s about as bad as it gets in a big spot. If you watch the Cruz touchdown, you’ll see S Gerald Sensabaugh coming down to help bracket Cruz. It was a modified, less “draconian” version of the inside-outside coverage I wrote about for Sunday’s paper. It’s clear from the way Sensabaugh tracked Cruz that was his guy and he wasn’t just providing general help over the top. That means Newman has help to the inside, which also means he has to maintain outside leverage. He didn’t come close to doing that and gave Cruz the edge. Now, because Sensabaugh is coming down to bracket Cruz, that means there’s no deep help, so you can’t get beat like that. You just can’t. Brutal night for Newman.
"I understand it," says Hedrick. "Like for a linebacker, it's easy to justify signing a 6-3, 225-pound guy who doesn't pan out. But how do you justify a 5-6, 5-7, 190-pound linebacker who doesn't pan out?"

Throw in the first-rounds from the 2006 draft, and Jay ranks fourth in WAR behind Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria (24.1), Florida's Chris Coghlan (2.8) and Cincinnati's … well, we'll get to that.

"(Beckmann) is trying to project himself in the German art world as an ambitious, grand painter of contemporary life," said Simon Kelly, curator of modern and contemporary art.

The flags will be flying in cemeteries today, thanks to the dedicated volunteers -- many, veterans themselves -- who, year after year, decorate the graves to honor those who fell or risked death in service to our country. Their selfless task helps put into concrete form our commemorations of their sacrifices for freedom, from the Revolutionary War to Afghanistan. We might also pause to remember fellow citizens far from our shores, still burying comrades and sacrificing comfortable lives and evenings with the kids for a greater cause.

At first I thought I'd be OK. Debbie and Carie told me they were going to start my day with Pam Nickle, whose forte is stripping. And not the kind involving a pole, a thumping beat and dollar bills.

Four players -- Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove, Will Smith, and Jonathan Vilma -- were notified today that they have been suspended without pay for conduct detrimental to the NFL as a result of their leadership roles in the New Orleans Saints' pay-for-performance/bounty program that endangered player safety over three seasons from 2009-2011. Participation by players in any such program is prohibited by the NFL constitution and bylaws, the standard NFL player contract, and the collective bargaining agreement.
Perhaps Leyland didnt want to go to Jose Valverde after he worked a rocky outing Sunday in Chicago. Perhaps he wanted Verlander to prove a point to himself and work his way out of it. And perhaps he really thought that Verlander gave the Tigers the best chance to win that particular game on that particular night. I tend to think it was the latter. But regardless, its not a decision that Leyland should make again. Let Verlander go 131 pitches in the playoffs or if a key game is on the line in August or September. I really doubt that pitch count will wear this guy down. But on the other hand, Id hate to take that risk. And going forward I dont think that Leyland will either.

Ms. Fleming drew on a trick she learned in the restaurant business: to decorate for low maintenance by having fewer, sturdier furnishings. As a result, the interior of the house, on a hill with a 360-degree-view, is sparse. The wood floors lack sealant, because that would require refinishing. The furniture—mostly wood antiques and comfortable, neutral colored sofas, gold mirrors and antique light fixtures—is meant to be timeless rather than trendy, so it shouldn't have to be replaced every few years.

My tour guide, Elisabeth Daude, who leads Stockholm walks in five languages, shows the way to a midsize apartment building at 1 Bellmansgatan. This is the real-life building where Mikael Blomkvist lives in reel life. Alas, Larsson fans are not invited in for snaps, but the building - a gabled, yellow neo-gothic affair shoved up against the hill - is interesting to look at. Residents use a narrow walkway high above the street to get in. It has sweeping views of Gamla Stan and the water, of course, in keeping with the romantic movie tradition of putting working-stiff characters in incredibly cool digs.
That's your memory applauding, not just us. That walk gave you a jolt of something called (sorry about this) brain-derived neurotrophic factor, better known as BDNF. (Think of it as Miracle-Gro for your brain!)

Now the Four Seasons has announced the creation of its King's Pond Eco-Crescent, 65 rooms surrounding its "swimming aquarium" King's Pond that reduce guests' environmental impact. Among the changes: compact fluorescent bulbs instead of incandescents, ceramic carafes and cups instead of disposable water bottles; refillable pump dispensers instead of tiny bottles of shampoo, reusable rubber spa sandals instead of disposable slippers, and so on. They may seem minor, but the substitutions add to a comprehensive program that includes large-scale efforts such as fishpond restoration and gray water irrigation and smaller ones such as those of the creative seamstress who turns worn textiles into aprons and teddy bear clothes.

Boisjoly was not the only engineer who attempted to stop the launch and suffered for blowing the whistle. Allan J. McDonald was Thiokol's program manager for the solid rocket booster and became the most important critic of the accident afterward.

Even a traditional cedar, pine or boxwood wreath can be given a contemporary tweak if you dispense with the usual embellishments. There's something elegant about a spare, unadorned circle of green. Add a few small apples, oranges, pomegranates or pepperberries for a natural color touch. Wrap or bow-tie the wreath with burlap for a rustic vibe, or use velvet ribbon in an unexpected hue like persimmon, purple or mustard.
Once established, crabapples need little care. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun. Very little pruning is required, other than to keep the desired shape. As with all other fruit trees, you should prune out crossing branches and remove water sprouts and suckers.

The layoff plan presented by the majority was not the plan discussed just days before the resolution was presented. I think that I can speak for all of the freeholders in that no one wants any layoffs of our hard-working, dedicated employees.

The members of the CWA, our lowest paid unit, will suffer; they will either lose their jobs or be forced into a pay cut. Is this fair?

Hey, Tom: Mark Price, John "Hot Rod" Williams, Carlos Boozer and Mo Williams are just examples of second-round draft picks who played for the Cavs and became stars. The examples litter the NBA.

To put it mildly, Russia is not considered a user-friendly country for disabled people. Buildings lack ramps and, often, elevators, and if anyone in a wheelchair tried without assistance to use the narrow tracks affixed to some staircases heading to the underpasses beneath busy Moscow and St. Petersburg streets, that person no doubt would crash. The widespread feeling is that the country has preferred that these people stay out of sight.

* The Illini fate will largely be determined by PG Demetri McCamey, who changes more frequently than the STL weather.
