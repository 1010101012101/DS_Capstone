"We are seeing younger and younger patients coming in with osteoarthritis because of more obesity and injuries," says Nicholas DiNubile, a Philadelphia-area orthopedic surgeon. Of particular concern, Dr. Nubile says is a sharp rise in injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, in the knee, most commonly seen among female soccer players. Some 50% to 80% of players with an ACL tear go on to develop osteoarthritis. But studies have shown that such injuries can be avoided with training programs that focus on landing and decelerating in a more controlled fashion.

If Paul had ever, for even one second, been my favorite Beatle, I'm sure this wouldn't irk me so much. But of course my favorite was the psychopath John because he was tortured, myopic and mean. I didn't know how mean till I read Bob Spitz's Beatles biography, but even now that I know, I don't care. At least he knew he was way too demented to work it out with anyone ever. Which is why, I guess, he married Yoko. (Talk about mean; check out the Spitz book.) Even for that, I have to forgive him.
Counterfeit luxury items — Bargain hunters should take extreme care when shopping for discounted brand-name merchandise on the Internet, the Better Business Bureau said in a recent bulletin. Websites such as Craigslist and EBay have been used to sell counterfeit items, the BBB said. But some firms have also set up their own websites to market knockoff luxury goods, which are often of poor quality and likely to disappoint the consumer, the group said. “In a tight economy, consumers are always looking to save a buck or two,” said Katherine Hutt, a spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus. “Too often, what looks to be a great deal is really a shoddy knockoff in disguise.” To avoid buying counterfeit merchandise, consumers should deal with reputable, known vendors, avoid deals that sound too good to be true and beware of ads that use phrases such as “genuine” or “authentic,” because those words are often a sign of trouble, the BBB said.

A vacation is a chance to get away from many of the stresses you can't get away from in your everyday life (your boss, your commute, the chaos that is your home). Of course, it can also introduce new ones. But while some of these may be out of your control — bad directions, missed connections, loud neighbors in hotels with thin walls — planning ahead can forestall others. If it's stressful for you to be around your in-laws, don't arrange a monthlong camping trip with them. If you're afraid of airplanes, pick a destination you can drive to instead — and don't get talked into skydiving lessons. If you suffer from separation anxiety, don't go anywhere Spot can't go too.

Most of the time, I can respond with an emphatic no. Most of the time my love for my children is a conduit for my relationship with God--an embodied metaphor, a medium through which to experience God's tender lovingkindness towards me. All of this goes hand-in-hand with the reality that being a mother also brings out some of my worst traits--impatience being chief among them--and those rightly are the source of deep penitence and compunction.

As in the risotto, Batson and her crew know how to bring the best out of vegetable dishes. That's clearly evident in cannelloni ($15) stuffed with leeks and chard and moistened with parsnip cream. Fourme d'Ambert was added for a rich, tangy note, and toasted walnuts for crunch.

Buchanan’s take: "Typical New York City point guard. Very good with the ball. Hungry to make plays. He's become a very good shooter. That's improved over the years with him and that was really a weakness for him. He's really worked on it. Doesn't have great ... physical tools. Not a great athlete; doesn't have great speed or quickness. So he relies on being able to be really good with the ball. Just a solid player."

Chen (2-0) could relax after seeing Orioles base runners aggressive, though not reckless, especially in a five-run second inning that featured six hits -- all singles.

Mr. Obama came to power deploring the Bush tactics of torture, extraordinary rendition and the preemptive, perpetual incarceration of terror suspects at Guantanamo. His administration trivialized terrorists as no more than criminals who should be put on trial in the federal courts, which were more than capable of dispensing justice while giving the accused a fair chance to defend themselves. What happened between now and then?

These are, after all, just chimps being chimps — as we see in “Chimpanzee,” their fascinating lives need no embellishment from Allen, or from Disney writers, whose contributions are often at odds with the camera’s passionate interest in rain forest life, even something as small as a raindrop striking the dry husk of a plant, releasing its spores into the air.

Desserts were good, but more delicate than the rustic savory courses. A crostata ($8.50), no bigger around than a coffee cup, was so good I wanted more. I felt similarly about the gooey, rich toffee budino with creme fraiche gelato ($8.50), although it wasn't warm, as advertised, which would have made it even better. I decided not to complain to the server, who was generally efficient and friendly. The staff showed up when needed and offered cogent explanations when asked.

It could also free up more money for AT&T to invest in new operations here, creating jobs.

Sold company to employees a few years ago, so his biggest problem these days is which Newport house to spend the night in.

Still, it is sad that some women still cut these sexual thoughts off at the pass to be "good girls." Not only are these women denying an essential part of who they are, but they are doing a disservice to their own sexual response and to their own relationships. When you shut off your sexual side and refuse to think about sex, you will have a very hard time "flipping the switch" when you do enter a sexual situation. You won't know your own body or your own responses, and you won't be able to relax and enjoy the moment.

Admittedly, this unpretentious, hand-held snack is nothing fancy. And while other once-plebeian fare has gone gourmet over the years - think pizza, ice cream and hamburgers -- I can't imagine anyone creating an artisanal taco, with, say, Kobe beef, shaved truffles and a spoonful of caviar. It would be too ridiculous.

Then there's this gem: "The policies in the 2013 budget will allow more time to develop long-term policies to address the persistently rising debt." Translation: "It's an election year, so we're not doing a thing about addressing the long-term unsustainable social spending problem because it might make us unpopular with millions of Americans on the receiving end. Instead, we'll savage Rep. Ryan's plan, which does offer some serious proposals to reign in runaway spending."

Last year, the most anticipated moment of the festivities was how the crowd would react to the introduction of new Cards hitting coach Mark McGwire, who not long before had admitted using performance-enhancing substances during his playing days.

That led some fans to think there was a cover-up in case McGwire was booed. Donovan said then that wasn't the case, that FSM's timing was off because those ceremonies also ran long.

"It actually goes very well with that wine," Spencer says.
They seemed pleased with the draft, in general, but preoccupied with their next task: signing undrafted free agents. The Ravens have done well in that area but face a unique challenge this season.

Fried was among the GOP officials who sent Wesley a letter in December asking him to resign. The officials said he had managed candidate campaigns poorly, raised too little money and mismanaged a lawsuit related to expenses from the 2003 county executive race.

"No matter how odious, bigoted, biased and unconstitutional Arizona's new law may be, let's be clear that there is no comparison between the situation facing immigrants, legal or illegal, in Arizona and what happened in the Holocaust," Abraham Foxman, the Anti-Defamation League's national director, said in a written statement.

That's bad news for anyone within earshot or bottle-rocket range of an inconsiderate neighbor.

"We will have a more convincing position if we move in both directions," Mr. Schäuble told her during the flight. "We need stricter rules for all, but we must also offer the instruments to fight contagion—in our own interest."
Perish to think what will happen if they should ever win their first playoff game since 2001. Or their first playoff series since 2000. What will we get then? Champagne? Parades? Holidays? Because this was the thing that was impossible to escape if you grinded your way through all 48 minutes of this indifferent 98-90 loss to the 21-41 Cavaliers:
But a new “Jane Eyre” needs more than a new Jane Eyre. It needs a formidable Rochester — and a fresh reason for being.
As with previous GT-R's, the personality on this one is tunable, via a trio of buttons on the dashboard. One controls the Bilstein shocks with Normal, Comfort and "R" modes (consider the "R" mode your ticket to, well, tickets. It’s the more progressive setting for each system, and allows drivers to better push the performance envelope). Another button handles the transmission shift mapping with Normal and "R" modes; and a third dials up the stability control with Normal, "R" and Off.
øMy final agreement with Sharon is that we will give each young family member a principle to recite and how to best put that principle to use, to be included along with the Christmas dinner blessing.
Nancy Snow Carr channels Patsy Cline, Nancy Sinatra, Carol Channing and a few sweet and ditzy blondes. Lisa H. Payton gets to play Rosa Parks for a moment and deliver a soulful rendition of the Billie Holiday standard "God Bless the Child," among the very few blues, gospel or Motown excerpts. Also absent from script and lyrics are such trailblazing female songwriters as Carole King, Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon.
Snyder and his top officials have been quiet in recent weeks about their plans for a bridge they call the New International Trade Crossing. Snyder hasn't ruled out bypassing the Legislature to get the bridge built after authorizing legislation was defeated in a Senate committee last year.

Though a Democrat won the top job, three Republicans won council seats -- the first time in 18 years that the GOP has been elected to the upper levels of county government.
ALPER: The facts back me up. The priorities coming out of Lansing are wrong for everyday citizens. You can tick off a "to do" list, but if the actions don't help people, what's the point? We saw business taxes cut again on the backs of citizens. An abominable redistricting plan passed. People have taken to the streets to say to Washington, "Think about the 99%, not just the 1%." Republican leaders want to gut Medicaid, privatize Medicare; they pushed a budget stalemate and held the supercommittee hostage. No wonder the tea party has a low approval rating. The Arab Spring and Occupy movements have shown us that social media protests can propel real change.
As singles, they can work with all the trainers, including Brett, who parachutes in -- literally -- and starts jabbering some nonsensical jock cliches about being back: "Boom shacka!" Er, what? But he seems like a nice guy, so maybe it's just the altitude that's made him apparently take leave of his senses for the moment.

Investigators believe the fire was caused by a problem with a dryer. No dollar loss estimate was made.
We’re used to professional athletes playing it safe with their bodies. The world of athletics is filled with men who wouldn’t dare come back a day before anyone expected them to be present. It’s not about risking injury most of the time, it’s simply about not wanting to look bad while people are watching and you're not at your best.

Most Chardonnay is best drunk young. The large majority of this full-bodied grape variety, which can take on a number of different guises from luscious and buttery to whistle-clean and steely, is made to be consumed within one to three years of its life. Of course, there are exceptions that can age for a decade or more when the aspect and location of the vineyard are right, the ripeness of the grapes has produced enough acidity and the winemaking is in tune.

All of which just adds to my natural skepticism about bureaucracies. Even good news, like the $300 mil, comes with an air of incompetence ("Hey, honey, you left this in your pocket when you put it in the wash.") It's no wonder that public polling puts trust in government at all-time lows.
There’s always a gap between what public officials say to the “gotcha” media and what they actually must do — especially when it comes to terrorism. If officials could candidly talk about the daily reports they get about possible lethal jihadist activity, the country would be in a state of permanent panic.

These traditional German-style potato pancakes are inspired by a recipe from his Austrian godmother. Manjencich grates two kinds of potatoes, Yukon Golds for sweetness and structure and russets for creaminess and binding. Baking powder transforms the patties into real pancakes, not just grated potatoes fried crisp like hash browns. On the side are sour cream, chopped green onion, horseradish or, for an authentic German experience, applesauce.

Wagner wrote the massacre at a Seal Beach beauty salon demonstrated that the killer acted with a "high degree of cruelty, viciousness and callousness," and that the killing spree was premeditated, planned and sophisticated. He added that the evidence will show that the eight victims were killed in an "execution-style fashion from close range" and that the victims were unarmed and particularly vulnerable and posed no threat to Dekraai.

Defense attorneys said Morales' testimony couldn't be trusted. They also pointed to DNA from an unknown male that was found on Levy's black running tights. The DNA matched neither Guandique nor Condit, and the defense said it was powerful evidence that the wrong person was on trial. Prosecutors argued the DNA was the result of contamination during the testing process.
It's a fitting end to the season. Warriors fans begging, praying, for a loss so Golden State can keep its draft pick. That's how far this season has spiraled.

RB Marshawn Lynch (225 carries, 969 yards, 9 TDs) has been on a tear, averaging 118 rushing yards over his last six games, with six total TDs and 109 yards or more in five of the six games. The Bears have been pretty stout against top RB threats. Last year they held Lynch to 44 yards on 17 carries in the regular season and two yards on four carries in the playoffs. Willie McGahee was coming off back-to-back 100-yard games, but the Bears held him to 34 on 17 carries last week. The Bears are 10th in rushing defense (102 ypg) and are allowing an average of 80.5 yards in their last eight games.

West Amwell Township resident Bill Wolfe, director of the state chapter of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and a former DEP planner, said he was glad the DEP checked its facts. “It’s unusual for a bureaucracy ever to admit an error,” he said. “You’ve got to give them credit.”
“New Jersey is a difficult state for young doctors,” Horan says. “Malpractice is very high. The cost of living is very high. And the reimbursement for doctors is not very good in the state.

Let me just say that this "Skyrim Bikini Contest" video is really stupid. It also probably took someone a fair amount of time to edit it and make all those characters clap, so I'll let you be the judge rather than deprive you of seeing for yourself. I think they’re trying to do the "so crass it’s funny because it’s poking fun at crassness" thing, but it just comes across as regular old-fashioned crass. I feel such ire toward that host that I was hoping a dragon would swoop in and light him on fire. The language and scantily-clad digital ladies are NSFW.
Researchers from Harvard Medical School in Boston studied 193 adults aged 25 and younger, and interviewed them to see whether they had been subject to a variety of different types of abuse, from 'harsh corporal punishment' down to 'parental verbal aggression.' They scanned the subjects with an MRI machine to see what their brains looked like.
You've probably seen the empty plastic bags hanging on door knobs all across town. Last Saturday, Scouts were driven around their neighborhoods to deliver the bags, and then this week they'll make a second sweep to gather up any donated products which contributors set out. If you don't have an official Scouting for Food one, any plastic grocery bag will work.
This larger and more casual trattoria space had already earned a major following in the hands of partner and chef Jeff Michaud, 34, himself a James Beard award winner. It has my nod as the city's second-best Italian (after Vetri itself, where he was a former chef). And in the five years since it opened, it has come to embody the rustic spirit that predominated when Vetri first opened, from the marvelous roasted-vegetable antipasto, to the gossamer sliced prosciutto, soulfully braised rabbit, spit-roasted suckling pig, inventive seasonal pastas, and wood-fired pizzas that set the standard for our current pizza craze.
The Tribe went in front 5-1 in the sixth on a two-run homer by Evans. Marte opened the inning with a walk and scored on Evans' first home run of the season.
Scam artists spring into action after every global disaster, setting up phony charities.
Lower price growth also leaves more money in consumers' pockets, boosting their buying power and supporting economic growth. The jump in gas and food prices early last year limited Americans' ability to buy other goods, slowing the economy.
And while the cynic in us continues to debate Smith’s real motives in penning his op-ed, it’s clear Goldman found itself flat-footed when confronted with a pretty predictable P.R. headache.
New Dorp pushed rival Tottenville to overtime, but suffered a disappointing loss to St. Joseph by the Sea in the Staten Island Shootout consolation game.

In the last decade, Congress has approved more than 4,000 additions, changes and deletions to the tax code -- all bought and paid for by professional lobbyists representing corporations, businesses and individuals. Is there a difference between Wal-Mart paying bribe money to do business in Mexico and the money that congressmen receive (as campaign "contributions") to enact specific legislation to help "hidden" and "unidentified" donors? I think not.
