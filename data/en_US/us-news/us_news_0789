Just another farm family trying to make it.
"Jeff, Who Lives at Home" could be just another quirky, abrasive and unconventional relationship comedy from the Duplass Brothers, the fellows who gave us "The Puffy Chair" and last year's "Cyrus." It starts with the assertion — by Jeff (Jason Segel), the title character — that "everyone and everything is interconnected in this universe." You know, he says, like that life-altering (and daft) M. Night Shyamalan movie "Signs," a film that's become Jeff's obsession.
Hastert didn't refer to Blagojevich in his brief letter lauding Harris. The note from the Republican leader was written on "Office of the Former Speaker" letterhead.
"It's just one more thing I lost in the fire," she said.
The industry argues that its services are intended for one-time emergencies. But one study showed that 90 percent of payday loans go to people taking out more than four a year. As one consumer advocate put it, it's like throwing an anchor to a drowning person.
Below is a chart showing year-by-year ridership since the formation of the regional transit agency in 1976, after the merger of several municipal public transit services.
While construction of the Hope Creek nuclear plant was completed during Kean's tenure as governor, the last nuclear power plant built in the United States is the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee, which commenced commercial operations in 1996.
The well-received deejay sets were a nonstop pastiche. Funkmaster Flex, for instance, barraged the crowd with 10-to-20-second snippets of well-known hip-hop records, punctuating the song changes with shouts, exhortations and call-and-response with listeners. Hook collided into hook, classic riffs gave way to modern favorites, and the audience roared with recognition each time the deejay switched the record. Funkmaster Flex has impeccable timing and an ear for clever juxtapositions, and he kept the aural collage bumping, without a lull, for 20 minutes (“I could do this all night,” he told the house). The landslide of beats, choruses and chants can be exhilarating; it can also feel like getting trapped in somebody’s ring-tone search.
Urquides was also recognized for her exhaustive work in mental health, continuing education and human relations.
Volatile energy prices and potential constraints on the use of fossil fuels will blunt the outward sprawl that has pulled resources and people from the urban core, Murphy predicted. Compact, walkable development is gaining popularity, he said.
But Ribisi has become the go-to guy for movie psychos, giving everything to performances like this one or as Moburg, the dissolute reporter in "The Rum Diary." Briggs isn't exactly a great character -- he's too cartoonish for that description to work -- but Ribisi makes him a lot of fun to watch. By extension, he makes "Contraband" a lot more fun to watch as well.
"It's probably not a good idea to place Yoenis Cespedes' locker next to Ramirez's," observed San Francisco Chronicle beat writer John Shea.

Spain's crisis isn't of a piece with Greece's or Portugal's, and it won't be resolved in the same way. The Spanish economy is much larger, but its ailments are not principally fiscal. Public debt was 65.8% of GDP at the end of last year. Indebtedness actually fell between 1996 and 2007 before climbing again during the financial crisis.
øWhat's new is an option to really refine the effect, with a wheel tool that offers better color rendering. My jeans at first looked purple and my black sweater blue. But with a few clicks, they regained their correct color. But putting the pictures of Hawaii, New Zealand and British Columbia underneath the video clip, on another portion of the timeline, I was able to shift my background from green to something quite exotic.
Rose’s absence in Game 2 was the break the Sixers needed to became the first No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference to win a game on the road since 2003. The Sixers head home and are ready to show Philadelphia they’re more than a minor speed bump in Chicago’s playoff run — they believe more than ever they can beat the top team in the East and make a big march of their own through May.
The test can be administered as early as 10 weeks into the pregnancy with 99 percent accuracy.
The percentage of high-poverty schools nationwide increased from 12 percent to 19 percent in the past decade. (In Baltimore, three-quarters of students attend high-poverty schools, up from 60 percent in 2000. The second-highest percentage is in Wicomico county, with 29. The statewide figure is 19 percent.) Students attending these schools are less likely to graduate from high school, and those who do are less likely to go to college. As the authors suggest, the idea of economic school integration can be one of the most cost-effective ways to produce what the nation desperately needs: highly skilled workers. When it comes to the debate during the fall campaign over how to fix our schools and prepare students for the challenges of the global marketplace, we can no longer afford to ignore ideas that work — whether the politicians choose to or not.

In neighboring Kandahar province, where U.S. soldiers patrol the birthplace of the Taliban, enemy-initiated attacks increased 13 percent. That region accounted for 21 percent of security incidents throughout Afghanistan, up 3 percent.
Still, optimism reigns in San Francisco, especially when it comes to the promise of technology to improve people's lives.
"Who's Afraid of Post-Blackness?" was released Sept. 13, and since then, the world has provided Touré with plenty of fresh material. Among other things, he's been watching the rise — and potential fall — of Republican presidential aspirant Herman Cain with horrified fascination.
The Romney radio ad criticizes Santorum's 1998 Senate vote to confirm Sotomayor to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. That put her one step from infiltrating the highest court with her liberal activist ways, the ad suggests, where she can create havoc for conservative causes. Who knew it was all Santorum's fault?
The Blue Beet has been around since 1912, and sits just a few (slightly exaggerated) feet from the foot of Newport Pier. If you haven't been to the peninsula recently, it's not just a lineup of beach bars and dives. Oh, they still exist, but the area has had a bit of a facelift, and even the venerable Blue Beet is looking good. In fact, it doesn't remind me of a beach bar at all, but rather a neighborhood tavern near Wrigley Field in Chicago.
Business investment is also slowing. Companies increased their spending on equipment and software at the slowest pace in nearly three years in the January-March quarter, the government said last week.
The lockout killed the mandatory rookie mini-camp and the 14 OTA (Organized Team Activities) sessions. OTAs are some of the most uninspiring things to watch or write about outside of paint drying, but they are where playbook familiarity begins as coaches walk the players through the choreography of scripted violence.

“The more I thought about it, the more rejuvenated I felt,” Perry said recently as he stood on the field at Reser Stadium as the Beavers finished up spring practice. “The opportunity to coach young men both on and off the field, I’m having a lot of fun with it.”
"I honesty think he is one the best pure athletes to come through Arizona," Kush said. "There wasn't a thing he couldn't do in athletics. If he did shot put, I don't know if he had thrown it the furthest, but he would have had the best mechanics and it would have allowed him to get close."
But that isn't the story he tells in his young-adult debut, "Playground: The Mostly True Story of a Former Bully." The fictional account of a 13-year-old's descent into bullydom is loosely based on 50 Cent's personal experience, only softened. Incorporating enough urban grit to be believable but otherwise smoothing off the rough edges of inner-city teendom to appeal to a young and mainstream audience, 50 Cent mines the situational psychology of a child who resorts to intimidation and violence.
The students presented their "Rio Salado Project" to the Valley's city leaders at an ASU forum. One vision was to fill the Salt River with water from end to end. The ideas piqued the interest of city officials.

Briggs knew we disagreed on this and welcomed the debate. I contend we can preserve football as the beautiful sport of choreographed contact America loves even after the NFL eliminates unnecessary blows to the head and cheap shots.

The store's counter is covered with British rock magazines like New Musical Express, Uncut and Mojo, and Bradshaw sees the parallels with their enterprise. "I'm not into this chest-beating, 'we-are-the-best' -- 'cause we're not -- but at its best, on a really good day, the store is like picking up a really good issue of Mojo."

The next major green development will be a much more intimate understanding of the real role clean water plays in the Earth's health and in our own. Right now, we say we understand how important water is ... but we don't treat it that way. We waste it, we pollute it without hope of reclaiming it in any really sustainable way. We of the "first world" fundamentally dismiss it as "a given," as if it has always been available to us in unlimited quantities... and we believe that will never change.

"Tea is so much more than a beverage," Peterson says. "It’s a sign of hospitality everywhere in the world. When you walk into a tearoom, people aren’t chatting on their cellphones.

"I think you do look at the person you're looking at and say, 'Is this part of an ongoing pattern of playing things close to the line and finally getting caught, or is this a person that anyone who ever had anything to do with him said this is a good person who has been a positive force in the community?' In the normal scheme of things, that does lead to perhaps less of a harsh outcome than if you have the feeling that this is a person who should have gotten caught a long time ago.
The second Maryland case makes similar claims, though it involves a single plaintiff: Rosemary Munyiri, a nurse who says she's never even had a parking ticket. Munyiri says she mistakenly ignored flares blocking an exit ramp on her way home from work in 2008, then didn't pull over quickly enough when an officer pursued her.
Things had been tense between council members and the mayor as her first term ended in 2009. So Council President Adrian Mapp — a founding member of the New Democrats and a man who gave Robinson-Briggs a run for the money in the last primary — met with his nemesis.

If an agency wants to investigate claims arising from a protest, he said, "the internal investigators in the police department are so in tune to who's involved from the department and what comes into play when you're making a decision to take aggressive action, it puts you way ahead in the investigation from the start. When you outsource it, they have to go back to square one."

There's no lack of ideas, Brownstein says. "I think we have figured out 70 different sketches to write for season two. We don't feel daunted, we just feel encouraged and inspired. In some ways, we know a little bit more what the show is now. When we were writing the first season, it was sort of written in a vacuum. In some ways knowing what the show is, and what you're writing for will make it a lot easier. That being said, we have every intention of still surprising people. We never want to veer into the realm of predictability."

However, one person plowing their way through will never create a path in the forest. Here we can draw wisdom from the words of Margret Mead, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." If women in the church continue to forge on alone and in isolation we will never be able to create a path to a place where women can gather together, in homes, churches, parks, chat rooms, wherever, and share.

These instruments, 284 at last count, have gathered $133 billion in assets, nearly all in the past three years; by comparison, 1,154 ETFs hold $1.1 trillion in total assets. The ETNs often track currencies, commodities and other assets rarely held by traditional ETFs—and can surprise unwary investors with high costs, quirky taxation and prices that may wander far from their asset value.

I think it would be fair to say that I am an expert skier, but my alpine touring and ski mountaineering experience is limited. However, I am comfortable in big-mountain terrain, managing 5,000-vertical-foot descents in Alaska's Talkeetna mountains with sluff chasing me and tackling off-piste classics in the Alps, such as Verbier, Switzerland's Bec des Rosses, a technical and exposed 50- to 60-degree face where extreme skiing's Freeride World Tour Championships are held each year. Last winter, I opened a new chapter in my skiing book when I started alpine touring and exploring Colorado's backcountry. I was hooked.

Dragging his feet into church, he groans, "Marge, why can't I worship God in my own way: by praying like hell on my deathbed?"
Since Save Gladstone is so concerned that Gladstone is paying more than its share, it may be worth pointing out the obvious. In the 21st year (for 20-year financing) or the 16th year (for 15-year financing), the citizens of Gladstone would own a library fair and square -- a claim that Happy Valley cannot make. This now becomes an asset owned by the citizens of Gladstone that we will have paid only 26 percent for. That is a return on investment that private-sector firms would die for.

One night I saw waiters snapping beans between waiting on tables, a task that's both necessary and connects them to what they're serving.

The summer before, President Lyndon Baines Johnson had ordered the Eighty-Second Airborne to Detroit after the rioting became so bad that the Michigan National Guard couldn't contain it. During the long hot summer of 1967, just about anything attempted by authority had struck the wrong chord. Tensions had finally come to a head in the early morning hours of July 23, 1967, when the police raided an illegal bar, also called a "blind pig," where a celebration for two black servicemen returning home from Vietnam was underway. When Detroit's finest, mostly white, began to load everybody into a paddy wagon, an angry mob, predominately black, had formed on the street outside.

The web site www.stegoarchive.com provides several more recent examples of steganography: "Computer files (images, sounds recordings, even disks) contain unused or insignificant areas of data. Steganography takes advantage of these areas, replacing them with information (encrypted mail, for instance). The files can then be exchanged without anyone knowing what really lies inside of them. An image of the space shuttle landing might contain a private letter to a friend. A recording of a short sentence might contain your company’s plans for a secret new product. Steganography can also be used to place a hidden ‘trademark’ in images, music, and software, a technique referred to as watermarking."

WASHINGTON — Americans probably won't be seeing a huge ticker-tape parade anytime soon for troops returning from Iraq, and it's not clear if veterans of the nine-year campaign will ever enjoy the grand, flag-waving, red-white-and-blue homecoming that the nation's fighting men and women received after World War II and the Gulf War.

But even President Obama has stayed locked into the same axis of debate over spending and taxes that has defined the relationship between Democrats and Republicans for decades. Times have changed. The crisis we face now is different from the ones in 1980, 1992 or even 2007. There is no sweet spot of marginal tax rates or government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product that is going to magically revive American manufacturing, restore our schools to global preeminence or confront the challenge posed by China and other rising economies. The bickering in Washington is not just destructive but is fundamentally irrelevant.

Williams said he's had the injury -- in which his knee cap essentially pops in and out of its socket -- since high school and it was the reason he shut down private workouts during the predraft process over the summer.

Two months later, Halak was on the way to St. Louis in exchange for former No. 1 draft choice Lars Eller. The deal has worked out well for the Blues. Halak, physically banged up in 2010-2011, had some disappointing stretches in his first season with the Blues. He had to make the mental adjustment of being the designated No. 1 goaltender.

Our response: Capitol Hill, without doubt, is a much more partisan, bare-knuckles kind of place than it was when Mr. Lugar first went to Washington in 1976. Lugar's style is to build consensus, reason with friend and foe alike, and look for opportunities to work together to get important things done. In contrast, his opponent in the Republican primary, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, promises to fight for ideological purity inside the Republican camp and to shun compromise with Democrats. That plays well to partisan crowds, but it's a formula for ineffectiveness and frustration in the Senate, which is designed to encourage moderation. The problems facing this country, including an out-of-control deficit, are daunting and Congress hasn't shown the ability in recent years to fix them. But adding another hard-core ideologue such as Mourdock to the mix is more likely to hurt than to help.

Governments have a duty to taxpayers to award contracts to the most responsible low bidder, yet local hiring has economic benefits that accrue to taxpayers, and sometimes the low bidder isn't locally based. So it makes sense to give preference to contractors that plan to open L.A. factories. When it comes to Kinkisharyo, though, there doesn't appear to be much difference between its hiring plans and Siemens'. An MTA analysis concluded that Kinkisharyo would create 348 U.S. jobs if awarded the rail car contract, compared with 391 by Siemens. The difference in economic benefit is vanishingly small: $138.8 million for Kinkisharyo and $140.6 million for Siemens. It appears to have been the right call by the board, and that's refreshing.
"It made more sense that it was Cynthia," said Lt. Eugene "Doc" Coombs, the special investigations commander for the Jefferson County sheriff's office.

Some of the passivity is by design: Leading figures in Sacramento have tried to keep details of the debate from becoming too public for fear that some special-interest group or another would try to kill it altogether, along the lines of what happened to "Hillary Care" in 1994.
