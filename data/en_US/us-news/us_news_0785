For venture capitalists, IPOs are often the preferred route for a young company. Dean Drako, founder and chief executive of the Web security firm Barracuda Networks, likens VCs to the gambler at the roulette table who judiciously scatters his chips across several numbers, knowing many will be lost but figuring one or two will pay off big. The entrepreneur, in contrast, always has a much larger stake on the table - in emotion, time, personal cash and sweat equity. With more to lose, the founder of a young company often prefers to place a safer bet.

A handful of these political rascals even wanted the township council to override the school board’s decision to keep the April election.

Kaye was a single mother who broke into the tight-knit world of L.A. studio musicians through talent and determination. Producer Bumps Blackwell heard her playing guitar at a jazz concert and invited her to play on sessions for a singer she didn't know much about, Sam Cooke. From there, she was on everything from "Good Vibrations" to "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" to "Feelin' Alright." She came up with the bass line that made Sonny and Cher's "The Beat Goes On" a classic and the six-note intro that started Campbell's "Wichita Lineman."

Victims of clerical abuse welcomed the findings and the Vatican's recommendations that bishops and religious superiors should continue devoting time to listening to victims and attending to their needs.

The year's most acrobatic melodies were penned by Forrest Kline. But it's not a melody contest. This one goes to Sarah Harmer, the part-time Canadian environmental activist who finally got around to putting out another set. Half of the songs on Oh Little Fire aren't anything special, but then there are the ones that are, and those are built to subtly wow those who've never tried to write a song, and to thoroughly destabilize those of us who've tried. "Late Bloomer" is a sauntering country-pop ballad in which Harmer lets some fibster rake play yo-yo with her heart; "One Match" is pure post-Vega grown-up storytelling; "Captive" is a coy cat-and-mouse game. The best by far, though, is "The City," which is one of those rainy trolley-window dreams, with all the elements of a town's architecture and a failed relationship thrown up in the air, only to have it all scatter on the tarmac until you can't tell which is which, or why you wanted to know in the first place.

The session Wednesday cements a detente between Suu Kyi's party and the administration of President Thein Sein, which came to power last year after the nation's long-ruling army junta stepped down.

Edsall, a disciplinarian from the Tom Coughlin coaching tree who prohibits ball caps and earrings during team meetings, has said repeatedly that he abides by two broad rules — be on time and do what's right.

Obama also has to define a driving value for his brand of centrism. The fundamental principle of centrism in the 1990s was that people would neither be left to fend for themselves nor guaranteed equality of outcome -- they would be given the tools they needed to achieve the American dream if they worked hard.

In all three locales, Birdseye is portrayed as a man who always wanted to know how things worked and when they don't, he is quick to invent an alternative.

I will say the Orioles, because I think the Tigers are going to run and hide in the AL Central in the next month now that their starting pitching has rounded into form. I think the Indians are a .500 team on their best day and they'll be fortunate to finish within 15 games of first place. The Orioles have a good combination of legitimacy (having gone 5-1 on their recent road trip) and good karma. I also think Jim Johnson is underrated, and will provide a means of finishing games that Baltimore hasn't had in a few years.

"The ability to get a first-round pick and an option for a higher pick the following year was the right decision for us." The Sessions trade coupled with the Varejao injury crippled the Cavs' playoff hopes. They went 5-20 after the trade deadline.

"Last year, my student was gifted. You teach at a different level, but the fulfillment is the same when you get a kid who feels better about herself. I also like kids this age. I think they are funny and outspoken. They have spunk and personality and they are just beginning to struggle with who they might define themselves as in the adult world. I think this program helps that to be a positive destination and to give them an entree into the adult world."

Not only can he switch between rhythm and lead parts so deftly that it seems like he’s playing both simultaneously, he can simulate the sound of a classical string section, a forest full of insects and tree frogs, or a helicopter crash. His instrument sounds like it was strung with live wires — if it started smoking or shooting off sparks as he played, no one would be surprised. His style has been imitated by so many hard rockers, it’s amazing he still has the capacity to astonish. But astonish he does and he does it effortlessly, with an imaginative faculty that never takes a measure off.

Bringing home a big, shiny gold thing is a great validation of a superb season, but it's not the only worthy end for us as consumers and fans of the game.

This restaurant's name alerts you that seafood is the specialty, and the kitchen offers several exceptional taco options. Crispy shrimp ($1.75) and moist, lightly battered pescado ($1.75) are fresh and tasty. But the taco you want to come here for is the smoked marlin ($2.75), a meaty species that transports you to the Mexican coast. Instead of the tangy chile de arbol salsa, it goes better with mayonnaise (which comes in a packet) and a few squeezes of lime.

By the way, there are some things no one ever told me before my first baby, and this is information I could have used: Your belly does NOT fully deflate after the birth - that actually can take weeks or even months; and those first few months after the baby is born can be particularly "unmagical." Little sleep, lots of worry about how much he or she is eating, a great deal of crying, and he or she isn't smiling at you for weeks. So, no emotional payback.

The elephant in the room here is an ethical one, because the line between seeing and selling — or pinning and purchasing — is so uncertain and indeed, embryonic. From a retail perspective, it's perhaps an ideal situation: Think passive window shopping meets persuasive personal engagement. On the other hand, for those adhering to the old-school traditions in which the roles of advertising and editorial are intended to function in parallel but separate worlds, the boundaries are murky. Is Pinterest a repository for aesthetic pleasure or a pop-up mall? Is it a stronghold for creative inspiration or a boomtown for visual entrepreneurs? Is it a sentimental scrapbook or a shopaholic's paradise? One thing is becoming clear: For those who view pinning as a promotional conceit, it's a slam dunk.

Dotson clarified today that Slay would only consider giving up control for those firefighters already hired – not firefighters yet to be hired.

New firefighters would have a new system, governed by city law.

Quite a voyage, indeed. Marsha Monro eyed several cashmere dresses, Splendora's Gina Pell purchased a wide leather belt with oversized brushed-gold buckle, and fine arts patron Angelique Griepp and venture capitalist Deepa Pakianathan made a pact over an ostrich feather shrug. Everyone wants to be distinctive when they walk into a room, and neither wanted to buy the piece if the other one did, for fear of looking like twins at a party.

It is ironic that SLPS finds itself in a microcosm mirroring the Turner case that the St. Louis County schools dread. The influx of thousands of children with very little notice is something the county schools repeatedly have said they could not handle; SLPS now must do exactly that. I am glad to see that SLPS Superintendent Kelvin Adams has not reacted by saying it can't be done. He has said it will be done. To make up for the snake oil sold in the name of school choice, there is no other choice, after all.

4 Speaking of the Oscars, if you prefer a less-buttoned-up awards wingding, tune in for the Film Independent Spirit Awards. This celebration of independent film has a looser atmosphere than the Oscars, with relaxed celebs, irreverent acceptance speeches and a general party vibe.

"I think they're right," he said. "The rich, they make all the bonuses and people are losing their houses. It's not right. Obama's got the right idea, but he needs to stand up to those guys."
What's interesting to me is that Isaiah's counter offensive to burnout is rooted in the memory of Israel as a community of worship and praise. It seems that overcoming spiritual burnout begins in worship, where we remember our identity as God's people. Paradoxically, we are filled in this act of giving. In other words, worship is not so much about "getting" something as it is giving.
Many middle schools feature some sort of collaborative effort in the humanities, but Lakeside's program is unique in that the two classrooms are physically linked to each other by a connecting door, teachers have the same students for both seventh and eighth grades, and kids of all strengths are intentionally mixed into each classroom, removing the need for Lakeside to offer any honors or GATE classes.

Anatolia really comes into its own in the entree category.

Anatolia's doner is classic: crispy on the outside, succulent and tender on the inside.

Like most people of my generation, I grew up surrounded by the stories of Civil Rights protests, bigotry, and Jim Crow laws. I heard stories of relatives who would not share a sidewalk with a black person, and heard others speak of "coloreds" in derogatory tones. I listened to my Chicago-born mother tell of being scolded when she tried to give up a seat on a bus to a black person, or accidentally drank from the "wrong" fountain while visiting in the south. I remember being told to "watch myself" while driving through "that part of town."

The elections will be the country's first since its economic crisis began in late 2009.

Since November, Mr. Papademos has headed an interim government—backed by the country's two main parties—whose mandate is to oversee the ratification and implementation of the country's latest bailout.

Mr. Glendening has recently said he regrets the "life means life" policy he employed, admitting it was a matter of politics, not justice. Our hope is that Mr. O'Malley's action in these cases represents a similar evolution in his views. It was clearly unjust that Ms. Settles has served three times as many years in prison as the man who fired the shots in the murder for which she was convicted. By all accounts, she has rehabilitated herself in prison and has the capacity to contribute to society. But surely hers is not the only such case.
