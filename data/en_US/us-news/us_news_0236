Red-baiting, a virulently partisan, pro-Republican press and Nixon's full-blooded fondness for gutter politics all played a role in Douglas' crushing defeat, as popular historical memory still stereotypically recalls. So too did an emerging postwar California middle class whose members imagined for themselves lives very much like the one Nixon and his handlers projected.

It's a decision I'd later have cause to regret, and not just because I arrived at the back door and messed up the grand entrance.

"Prometheus": Sci-fi has been very, very good to Ridley Scott, the director of "Alien" and "Blade Runner." Now he's back at the genre with a space race of sorts, this one conducted by a team of explorers who go on an incredible trip to far-off galaxies and must scramble to protect humanity from ... what exactly?

Warm-water action, particularly for bass, is good at most Front Range waters. Water temperatures are mostly in the mid-50s. Chatfield, Bear Creek and Boyd report decent action using plastics, such as worms, lizards and tubes. Good options for trout include Evergreen, Lon Hagler, Pinewood and South Park waters. Many are using dough baits, but spinners also produce for shore fishers. If there is surface action, dig out the fly and bubble. The Clear Creek, South Platte, Big Thompson and Poudre rivers remain low and fly-fishers have been doing well; stoneflies and attractor patterns are a good bet.

"We're at the 50-minute mark anyway. We got 60 against Nashville, it was great; we got 60 against L.A., we played great. We get 30 against Chicago (the start of the losing streak), we get 20 against Columbus, then we got 50 last night. If we're going to get 50 minutes of that type of performance, we've got something to build on. But against a team like Detroit, it's got to be 60. If we would have stayed on the program for 60 minutes and managed the puck the right way, and stayed on the forecheck and stayed on the hunt, we would have won the game for sure. It wasn't like they jumped into the game, we let them into the game. We let them into the game by backing off too much. You can't do that against that team."

"That's all it can be," said captain David Backes, who scored his team-leading 19th goal. "We're happy with the personnel that we have. We have a few guys injured that we'd love to have back in the lineup, but it's time to move forward. We had a contribution from a lot of players tonight - even if it wasn't on the score sheet, they're contributing in different ways. This was probably a carbon copy of the way we need to be on the road to make sure we get our wins."

Under the old-school method of redrawing political boundaries, elected officials would get together in a back room to horse-trade, bicker and dicker, then meet again in the open to adopt their new maps as a done deal. If you didn't like what they came up with, you had to sue — and you could win, but only if you could show that the maps discriminated against a historically underrepresented group. This is still the way it's done in most jurisdictions in the country, and was the way the Los Angeles City Council did things until 2000.

"What you really want to see is sales going up, inventories going down, and prices going up, not down," said David Semmens, an economist with Standard Chartered.

“As I have repeatedly explained, I believe that drug testing state employees is a common-sense means of ensuring a safe, efficient and productive work force,” Scott said. “That is why so many private employers drug test, and why the public and Florida’s taxpayers overwhelmingly support this policy.

The more time you spend in these occasionally gritty, mostly gentrified neighborhoods around the park — Silver Lake, Los Feliz and Echo Park — the more you realize that they're incubators of American pop culture. Thousands who live here work onstage and off in movies and TV, make music, art and theater, keep up with the interwebs and savor all things ironic (including the nonword "interwebs," a.k.a. the Internet to the rest of us). Yes, Hollywood is glitzier and Beverly Hills is richer. But who's cooler? These 10 micro-itineraries, the third in a series that concentrates on Los Angeles and Orange counties, might help you decide.
“Inception” works beautifully, too — and if the story’s intricate shifts in time and consciousness demand audiences see it a second time to take it all in, well, that’s fine with DiCaprio.

The Kings had an 8-0 shots advantage before Jonathan Quick finally faced a shot at 9:21, then undressed the Blues' power play for their second short-handed goal of the series with Brown stealing the puck from Carlo Colaiacovo in the St. Louis zone and feeding it in front to Kopitar, who had enough time to stretch Elliott across the crease to the breaking point.
David Lindsay-Abaire adapted the screenplay from his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Mitchell, who previously directed the subversive and sexually daring "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" and "Shortbus," would seem an unusual choice for such traditionally dramatic material. While Mitchell has expanded the scenery a bit, you still can never shake the sensation that you're watching a play on film. That draws attention to the structured theatricality of the work, but also makes the more powerful moments hit home with a piercing directness.

But Valle de Bravo is as much a secular playground as a spiritual center.

She went the way of D.D., Camille Grammer’s BFF from the Beverly Hills Housewives, and made her friend’s fight her own.

Transfer of ownership is the final step in the demise of a franchise that's played in Portland with few interruptions since 1903. The team's fate was set last year when proposals to construct a baseball-only stadium in Portland and Beaverton fell through and the Portland Timbers soccer team, which Paulson also owns, was granted entry into Major League Soccer.

"Blue Like Jazz," based on a spiritual journey book by the real Donald Miller, is an ambling movie that skates around on the surface of a lot of deep thoughts. The whole jazz metaphor is no deeper than The Hobo's insistence that Donny have his John Coltrane LP collection. Like Donny himself, the film puffs itself up as substantial when all it's aiming for here is glib and snarky and shallow. Donny wants to be a writer, so the film is structured like a junior-college writers seminar, ineptly built around "setting, conflict, climax and resolution" bullet points.

Grunwald, played by Raye Birk, espouses well-made drama in the style of Ibsen, Shaw and Chekhov, playwrights whose portraits adorn the walls of his office. Anything more modern is disdained as "experimental," including Stanislavski, whom he dismisses as "a Russian Jew who made a fortune off of insecure actors." Opinionated, manipulative and self-absorbed, this character could easily come off as repellent were it not for the engaging energy and insight Birk brings to the role. He subtly reveals the disappointments that underlie Grunwald's bravado and tempers his egotism with charm and self-deprecating humor. It's a wonderfully assured and modulated performance.
As Hochberg began to dial 911 from his cell phone, the Jeep was right behind his car.

Christian rock concerts – A Downey woman who told investors she was raising money for a Christian rock concert but instead used the money for personal expenses and to pay returns to early investors has been sentenced to nearly five years in prison. Lauren Baumann pleaded guilty in October to wire fraud, admitting she falsely promised to use investors’ money to finance a Christian "battle of the bands," and repay them with profits from ticket sales. Instead, authorities said, Baumann used proceeds from the scheme to rent a $10,000-a-month historic mansion in Downey and to pay private-school tuition for her children. U.S. District Judge Josephine S. Tucker sentenced Baumann to 57 months in prison. She was ordered to report to a federal prison by April 2 to begin serving her sentence.

I'm not sure about the colobus monkey, but more than a few California retailers blithely hopped right around the kangaroo ban. It seems soccer aficionados loved to sport shoes made from kangaroo skin, which they claimed were lighter and more flexible than shoes made from cows or pigs or marine iguanas. Soccer superstar David Beckham, for example, enthusiastically endorsed kangaroo-skin shoes made by Adidas, the German-headquartered athletic gear manufacturer. So sports stores in the Golden State did illegally what sports stores in 49 other states did legally: sold kangaroo-skin shoes.

So overall, if voters approve both taxes, a homeowner in Portland will see the public schools' portion of the property tax bill rise by nearly 50 percent, to a total of about $1,500 on a typical home. Currently, that bill is about $6 per $1,000 of assessed value, or about $1,070 on that typical home. The discretionary taxes the district is allowed to collect if it can get the OK from voters -- a bond and local option -- would triple, to about $720 on a typical home.

In 2008, Hungary secured an IMF-led bailout of euro20 billion ($26 billion) to avoid bankruptcy during an earlier, Socialist government. In 2010, Orban decided not to extend the IMF deal to allow the government to set its economic policies without the fund's intervention. But last November, in a shocking U-turn, Hungary said it would in fact seek IMF-EU financial support to strengthen investor confidence.

Sue Hildick, president of the Chalkboard Project, a nonprofit focused on improving achievement, said she has not seen action on such a broad scale in her group's eight-year history.

Will Sasso (best known for "Mad TV") and Sean Hayes (ditto for "Will & Grace") will play Curly and Larry. Yet to be cast is Moe, although we're fairly certain it won't be Del Toro.
One evening, I heard the heavy strumming of my son's guitar from his room. I dropped in for a visit. I scrolled through his iPod to a song with one of my favorite guitar solos - "Joining a Fan Club" by an obscure 1990s band called Jellyfish - and asked if he could replicate it. One more listen and my son launched into his own goose-bump-inducing version.
The official said Mahmoud Abbas, who has been in Tunisia this week, was expected to go to Libya but canceled because of security concerns. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.

So state lawmakers threatened to gut the law. This time, activists and voters got mad. They pointed to the state's reputation as the nation's "puppy mill capital."
"Once they're done with their education, they can't legally work here," he said. "And so to me, we're not stopping that feeling of hopelessness, we're instead prolonging it. We're putting families in a lot worse financial situation."
Think of it this way: Wayne is making up for lost time. The rapper spent the better part of a year cooling his heels in Riker's. This is a tough image to reconcile with what we know about Lil Wayne. Onstage, he is in constant motion, running his mouth and his feet nonstop. How could he have sat in a cell for months when he can't stand still for a moment?
The daughter of a Jewish father and a Mormon mom, Handler is the youngest of six siblings (most still reside in the Garden State). She believes her proficiency with punch lines is inherited, while many of her signature euphemisms -- "batchookie," "coslopus," "shadoobie" -- are inspired by her brothers and sisters.

Scott McClellan, the president's press secretary, complained that the Newsweek report on the Koran was based on a "single anonymous source." That leads to the greatest irony in the current controversy: The White House is often the greatest offender. Although McClellan recently promised Washington news bureau chiefs that the practice would be curtailed, reporters are routinely called in for "background" briefings by White House officials, who insist they cannot be identified by name or title.
The Knicks and Heat were once the game's biggest rivalry back in the late 1990s thanks to Pat Riley. Riley, the current Heat president, was the coach in New York from 1991-95 and took the Knicks to the '94 NBA Finals. He resigned from New York via fax to move on to South Florida, creating quite a bit of acrimony with the New York faithful.

TechAmerica (formerly known as AeA and the American Electronics Association) promotes the tech industry across the country and in individual states. As such, it's reports always highlight the industry's upside -- but they're still useful for tracking trends and comparing growth among the states. Nationwide, the tech industry lost 115,800 jobs last year -- a 2 percent decline of a work force TechAmerica tallies at 5.75 million.
Legislators' comprehensive annual financial disclosures will not be posted online, as proposed in the original bill sponsored by state Sen. Jamie Raskin. This summer, a panel appointed by legislative leaders will explore the possibility of publishing those forms, which contain more information than the conflict-of-interest records.
The demonstration garden's ornamental beds change with the seasons. The shade and sun garden transitions from woodland plants to sun-loving perennials and shrubs. Irises and daylilies form perennial borders. You can rest in a sheltered gazebo covered with fuchsia and clematis vines.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a brash Republican often likened to Kasich, signed an order on Aug. 26 putting in place a one-year moratorium on fracking in his state after rejecting a permanent ban on the practice passed by Garden State lawmakers.
The measurement is not a new concept. Davis Payne often professed his desire for the Blues to play 200 feet, or the entire ice surface. But when the Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 3-0 Tuesday night at Scottrade Center, Hitchcock indicated his Blues team will have to get up to speed to play a 200-foot game, at least in his version.
On the floor, House Majority Leader Matt Dean, an architect by trade, described the beauty of the structure. Then he took a swipe at our Flickertail neighbors: "Has anybody seen North Dakota's Capitol? It's like, State Farm Insurance called, they want their office building back."

TRENTON — In a move some say could weaken consumer protections, the state Division of Consumer Affairs is instituting a "waiver rule" that will allow it to grant exemptions on regulations covering nearly every product and service bought and sold in New Jersey.
"The result of that vote was simply that bars in casinos wound up being on the same playing field as anyone else who qualified for an exemption," he said.
If the success of the Internet can be attributed to one basic principle it's this: information should move freely from one place to another without restrictions. That's not a hippie-dippy drum-circle philosophy, either. It's simple engineering. It's the reason why Google, Wikipedia, Amazon, Twitter, The Comics Curmudgeon, and all of the other sites I love and rely on happened. Good ideas get to prove themselves in front of the worldwide Internet community immediately, and they're adapt to changing needs.
Bar-Aba glowers magnificently, his compact form imploding with anger. Ashkenazi, his large, expressive eyes filled with anxiety or alarm, is a rough bear of an actor who transmits a piercing intellect and warmth. These two don't look alike, but it's easy work accepting them as a combative, complicated father and son. And it's easy to see the passion they feel for the Talmud.

About half of 170 hospitals that have performed kidney transplants have used anonymous living donors three times or fewer.
He looked, and sounded, calm that week. He had fun. Despite Auburn having the Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback, and the best defensive player in the upcoming NFL draft, I believe Kelly was convinced he was going to win that game. And because he believed, I believed. Fans did, too. I can only imagine that the players who were around him every day must have felt that conviction in their bones.
"The eyes are the most important thing on a character. That's what people are always drawn to," said Nikolai, who worked on Splash Mountain atDisneyland and the Monsters Inc. dark ride at California Adventure. "His eyes can do anything we want him to do.

Blanton had a base-running blunder in the eighth. He singled to center with one out, but then took off for second on Rollins' fly ball to left field. Martin Prado quickly threw the ball to Dan Uggla, whose relay throw to first easily beat Blanton back for a double play.
Our society needs more problem solvers and fewer excuse makers. We can get more of them if everyone starts trusting grown professionals over young people who we think lack the judgment necessary to vote or even drive responsibly.

It’s too soon to tell whether Kelsey is autistic, but she exhibits behaviors that concern the doctors. She’s not where she should be developmentally. She babbles, but has no words. This could just be a reflection of growing up in a household with two autistic siblings — She sees them get what they want without speaking, so why speak? — or it could be more serious.
And in Ann Arbor, where the unemployment rate dipped to 5.4% in February, Google has added several dozen new sales and service employees so far this year, with more hiring expected in coming months.

The start of court Monday marked Day 11 of a trial that was still on its third witness. Walton opened the proceedings by again expressing his concerns about the slow pace and said he might impose time limits if the lawyers persist in what he called "unnecessary questioning."
-Critics do matter. Fan sites often like to say that the critics don't have much to say about whether a film will succeed. That may be true for a certain kind of generic action movie. But the strong critical support for "The Avengers" (there were some voices of dissent, like the New York Times' A.O. Scott, but they were few and far between) helped extend the movie far beyond the base. Telling stat: The two superhero movies with the biggest opening weekends, "The Avengers" and "The Dark Knight," are also, with Rotten Tomatoes scores hovering around 93 percent, also far and away the best-reviewed.

I have to respond to these comments regarding the firefighters. I've been a firefighter for years. I'm on disability. And that's just the way it works. We made an agreement with the city and this is wholly negotiated. So I don't have a problem with it. It's no different than ballplayers. They're getting paid. You can still go down there and pay extra for the Cardinals after they increase their ticket sales. So why shouldn't taxpayers pick up the money for us to be on disability? It's no different. We put our lives on the line. We deserve it. That's just the way it is. So get over it.
"I don't know how people can afford these increases every year. We are about at our limit," Libresco said. "Whether it's 20% or 29%, it's still an enormous number."
LA: I have one more question for you. You describe a society in which people look after themselves because they know the most about themselves, and they will flourish if you let them. You, however, are a crusader for the rights of others. For example, you say in "Free to Choose" - and it's a very powerful statement - a tiny minority is what matters. So is it one of the weaknesses of the free market that it requires certain extremely talented and disinterested people who can defend it?
The report lists one Ohio legislator as having graduated from the University of Michigan. It doesn't name names, but Tipoff will: State Rep. Mike Duffey of Worthington. We're keeping our eye on you.

"My Week" moves between Monroe's friction with Olivier ( Kenneth Branagh) during production, her struggle with depression away from the set and the machinations of the small circle of sycophants always around her. A clearly smitten Clark becomes her shoulder to lean on, a trusted advisor, and her co-conspirator in escaping, at least briefly, the star machine.
Typically, the Fed can lower interest rates to encourage Americans to borrow money and spend it, invigorating the economy. But the benchmark interest rate controlled by the Fed has been almost zero for more than a year now.

Su Shan Tan, head of private banking at DBS Group in Singapore, on the effect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. The new law, to be phased in starting Jan. 1, seeks to prevent tax evasion by Americans with offshore accounts. It requires financial institutions outside the United States to report information about income and interest payments to the accounts of American clients. That means additional compliance costs for banks and fewer investment options for U.S. citizens living abroad.

And it doesn't hurt, as Uhelszki notes, that "he still likes muscle cars even though he could afford a fleet of Bentleys. He still seems affected by the same things that he did when he started out."
The book isn’t nearly as political or as outspokenly dire as “1984,” so much so that it’s easy to picture a young reader saying, “What is supposed to be so bad about all this?” Unlike in the book by Orwell (Huxley’s pupil at Eton), in which independence of mind earns you torture and brainwashing, Huxley’s freethinkers are threatened with expulsion to a small island (Iceland) — but the joke turns out to be that this isn’t really a punishment because all the cool artists and original thinkers wind up together and are much happier in their own hipster enclave. Iceland: the sixth borough.

That's probably why House Speaker John Boehner initially embraced the Senate plan — but quickly withdrew it after he found out he didn't have support of his caucus. So the House rejected the Senate's two-month extension on Tuesday, chiefly on the argument that they preferred a one-year deal.
Why it might work: Red means "ready" in primate language. Some monkeys and apes advertise their sexual prime times on their skin, turning bright red throughout their vulvas, buttocks, chests and faces during ovulation. Male primates prefer to mate with these flushed females. We humans may not have red rumps, but men may be drawn to the color -- whether gleaming from lips, splashed across camisoles or in the blush on a face -- all the same, Elliot says.
Nicholas J. DiCarlo and his wife, Suzanne, paid cash for a 6,180-square-foot home with pool built in 2003 on the north side of the Foothills Golf Club in Phoenix.

The euro's first decade was much different. The currency was introduced in 1999. Investors—their devaluation worries banished—viewed the bonds of Mediterranean economies as a close substitute for those of Germany and other solid economies, and were drawn to them by slightly higher yields.
Nate McMillan also has used the All-Star break to fly to Tempe to watch Jamelle, including this year. But he won’t be able to take part in Saturday’s Senior Day activities.
Timken followed that purchase in 2008 by buying Houston's Boring Specialties Inc., a company that processed steel pipes for the oil and gas industry. Timken had supplied BSI with steel for years.
St. Joseph and its parent, Denver-based Catholic Health Initiatives, are depending on the November 2009 release as they seek to have the suit dismissed. The contract shields the hospital from responsibility for any consequences of Midei's activities there.

It's likely the boy did find enjoyment in drawing, even at an early age. One story has it that his first brushwork used tar, which was used on the family farm for patching roofs and fixing drains.
You see, this so-called "Jennings Freeway" doesn't officially exist. It may be marked on maps and called that by most of the area population, but the name's not formally recognized by the Ohio Department of Transportation. To them, that highway's just Ohio 176, and it's marked as such.
