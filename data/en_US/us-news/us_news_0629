I wanted a cheeseburger really bad the other day. However, I had made a pledge to really buckle down on cutting out the high-octane junk intake. The problem was I had nothing in the way between me and cheeseburger. There were no obligations to attend to, no financial or logistical barriers preventing me from obtaining my coveted treat.

Most citrus fruits are ready to be picked now. Instead of letting them drop to the ground to rot or attract the dreaded roof rats, take them to work to share with co-workers. And food banks around the Valley will accept any citrus. As far as the trees themselves are concerned, fertilize them around mid-February. Water thoroughly before and after fertilization. In fact, consider watering all of your plants at this time if there has been no rain. If you planted wildflowers, keep them watered as it is proving to be a fairly dry late winter.

There's still a lot to do before anything is passed into law, before Congress manages to produce even a cut-down emergency version of the transportation package that used to be just everyday business.

The historic City Market is housed in a series of open sheds built in the early 1800s that stretch about three blocks down the middle of Market Street.

The Method is dead. Long live the Method. ¶ Spend an afternoon with David Lee Strasberg, the ambitious 38-year-old son of legendary acting guru Lee Strasberg, and you just might walk away with the idea that something revolutionary is going on at the Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. That would be overstating matters. This family-run school with flagships in West Hollywood and New York still finds its raison d'être in what Strasberg himself identified as the training of the actor's internal skills. But the vision of the Method being articulated at the institute, observing its 40th anniversary this year, seems to have little to do with the stereotype of sweaty, mumbling actors wallowing in the muck of unhappy childhoods. ¶ Dressed in preppy clothes that hint at his undergraduate days at Brown, Strasberg fils, the institute's CEO and creative director (whom I'll refer to as DLS), says that the Strasberg approach -- the best known of the American adaptations of the Stanislavsky "system" commonly grouped together as the Method -- is less reliant on psychobabble than most people believe. The words "Oedipal Complex" never pass his lips. But more interesting is the way developments in neuroscience keep cropping up in his conversation. Don't bother telling him about the toy your parents didn't buy you, but do engage him on the subject of conditioned reflexes and the neuropsychology of smells.

“Think Like a Man” avoids falling into the same traps as similar movies (the dreadful “New Year’s Eve,” for one) that typically pack an ensemble with overqualified actors in underdeveloped roles. This crowd-pleaser is well cast with a talented mix of familiar performers who aren’t household names. They are attractive people but not so supermodel-ish that they seem false. (It’s particularly nice to see Henson, an Oscar nominee for “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” finally get a chance to revel in some glamour.)

A: Yes. Take pictures of your car before and after your rental and keep them at least six months. The systems used to determine who damaged a rental are far from perfect. At least one company, Hertz, has pledged to begin photographing all of its cars before they leave the lot. The rest have less scientific ways of determining who is responsible for the dings, dents and scratches. If I didn't know any better, I'd say they try to guess who might have done it.

The sales rebound comes with risks that are familiar to Detroit. Crank up production too much and carmakers have to sell vehicles at deep discounts.

Initially, I tried imitating what I had seen in the Pinterest board photos. The problem was, I looked -- and felt -- ridiculous. If I was going to be comfortable and happy with these photos, I needed to be myself -- every clumsy, goofy, awkward bit.
Stocks spent most of the day in a slump. The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate climbed to a seven-month high of 9.8 percent in November. Employers added just 39,000 jobs, far below what economists forecast.
Sound complicated? Those are just the basics.
Strickland's new consulting firm will have offices in Columbus and Washington, D.C. and will focus on business clients and political and advocacy campaigns.

Martin Freeman ("The Hobbit") is a solid Watson, not stodgy or befuddled like previous interpretations, and not a mere plot device, but a manly sidekick. (The two are frequently mistaken for a couple, perhaps a nod to years of literary analysis of the pair).
Goodyear:
Or, if you prefer: if you include this season's salary, the Cardinals will have Molina behind the plate for the next six seasons at an AAV of $13.6 million. (Does that ease the sticker shock at all for you?)
The higher-achieving magnet is no longer included in Birmingham's overall test scores, which may have contributed to a first-year decline in the school's results. Birmingham ranked in the bottom 20% of schools statewide and the bottom 40% of similar campuses.

A fine-dining establishment doesn't have some kind of herbal crème brûlée that elicits a quarrel at our table: I said it tasted like suntan lotion; my GF insisted it was more like baby shampoo. I'll go with inedible, tempered by flavor notes of something not found in the natural world.
"I think we've been able to learn a lot already," Bernard said of the last race. "We can dwell on the negative or we can focus on the future and work to make this the best event in the world."

6:08 p.m.: Best Alternative Music Album award goes to the Black Keys, for "Brothers," beating out "The Suburbs," by Arcade Fire. "The Suburbs" was nominated for Album of the Year, though (open to all genres), and the Black Keys weren't -- one of those unexplained Grammy things (if voters prefer "Brothers" here, why isn't it up for Album of the Year?). In any event, it's hard to imagine "The Suburbs" winning Album of the Year, later tonight, after this diss.
As usual with past product introductions by Apple, rumors have swirled around the media ahead of time. The most common rumors — which line up generally with most analysts's expectations — have the new iPad 3 featuring a faster, possibly quad-core processor and a high-resolution display similar to the "Retina display" currently used in the company's iPhone and iPod Touch products.

M-1 and SEMCOG should coordinate efforts to ensure the best use of rapid transit buses and light rail on Woodward. Side-running light rail and rapid transit buses could run concurrently, serving two distinct transit needs. Light rail from downtown to the New Center would serve mainly secondary trips for riders living, working or visiting downtown. Limited-stop rapid transit buses from downtown to 15 Mile would provide city-suburban commutes without transfers.

I asked Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby if the district or state has a cohort it follows separating kids from single- and dual-parent homes. He said not in Portland and not that he is aware of in the state. My guess is the breakout would be telling. As amazing as many single parents are, they typically have less time and money to give their kids. (Note: The school district is making a concerted effort to give all families tips for how to keep kids on track and find out when they are not.)
The indictments confirm suspicions of a link between the murders that Phoenix and Paradise Valley investigators have been working to verify ever since the Shapiros were discovered on Jan. 30 in their burnt bedroom.

I checked with the State Department, which already publishes some of the information that the bill would require.

The government doesn't offer that information specifically regarding a hotel, though.

The opponents of legalized video poker are still screaming about the "massive expansion" of sinful gambling it represents, as if the tens of thousands of machines that illegally pay out somehow don't exist.
The state contended that the doctors who said she was in a persistent vegetative state were wrong. The state showed a videotape of Christine. Her mouth was frozen in a sort of smile. In the tape, a woman put lipstick on Christine and then another woman kidded Christine about wearing off the lipstick kissing people. She seemed unresponsive, but when the people - and the noise - moved, her eyes seemed to track them.

The German shepherd dog is hailed as the world's leading police, guard and military dog, however, this dependable breed is more than its nine to five job.

But not physically. At 5-4, 110 pounds, he's lean and on the slight side, built more like a wasp with a six-pack than a plodding moose. But as the quarterback rolls to his left during the practice in black Nike high-top cleats and matching wristbands, he is quick and his footwork is sound as he commandeers the offense through some basic plays. This is his team, no question. He has a natural charisma that one high school coach describes as "that winner category."

Elsewhere, the spokesman for the governor of the northwestern province of Badghis says four police officers were killed Saturday when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb in Qadis district.
"It's finally nice to have some upperclassmen on the team," said O'Leary. "Because I do think that it's always nice to have that upper class mentality where we may give up a goal or two, but they know that they can get the ball back and that they can score at the other end."

"Dick Clark was a primary force in legitimizing rock 'n' roll," Uslan said. "He was able to use his unparalleled communication skills to present it in a way that it was palatable to parents and the establishment. Dick's philosophy was that it was like introducing someone to hot, spicy Mexican food. He would say, 'Start them out with the mild stuff first and once they get a taste for it they'll jump in for the really hot stuff, the authentic stuff.'"

"I don't believe in stereotypes of any kind," Ganley said in an e-mailed statement. "Clearly the words used were inappropriate, but with unemployment over 11 percent in Ohio we need to stick to the issues."

More crucially, it lacks suspense; it's pretty clear early on what's happening at a remote research site, so the film quickly becomes an exercise in guessing who the next person to meet his or her gruesome fate will be. (Hint: Most. It's like a bad version of "Hamlet" in fur parkas.)

In recent years, the vast majority of Derby participants didn't accomplish as much after the race as before it. The reasons include an arduous path merely to get to the Derby, the 20-horse field that almost always induces contact, the 150,000-plus crowd with an overflow saddling paddock and the 1 1/4-mile distance that's beyond the scope of most 3-year-olds.

That goes not just for scholars, but for the general public, too. In a special reading room, under supervision and amid tight security, you’ll be able to peruse material from the archives, although in the case of certain highly valuable items -- Jimi Hendrix’s handwritten “Purple Haze” lyrics, for example -- you might have to settle for studying a digital scan or a color copy of the original.

On our Update visit, Meneghelli displayed a competent, workmanlike approach to the food, but the creations lacked some of the flourishes that would make them stand out. The salad Lyonnaise ($12), mostly made up of lentils with a few sprigs of frisee, a couple lardons and a poached egg, was OK, but the lentils dominated and the dish needed more bacon flavor. The pate maison ($12), wrapped in bacon and served with toast, mustard and a small knob of apple and celery heart salad, was strong-armed by sweet spices that diminished the natural flavor of the meat. It was good, but a little goes a long way.
HSUS has been pushing for more than a decade for large-scale purchasers of animal products to ensure that they are raised humanely.

Normally when an offensive player goes there he has two options  pass the puck in front to an open player or try a wraparound.
Sheer happiness.
UO defense vs. UCLA offense: Since UCLA's defense is unlikely to suddenly become dominant against Oregon, the Bruins' offense must carry the day for them to win. That would be something to see. UCLA ranks 10th in the conference in scoring (23.2 points per game). Oregon has scored more than that in a quarter this season. UCLA's Pistol offense has been able to rack up rushing yards to the tune of 193.2 per game (third in the conference). But the passing attack has produced just 14 touchdowns. UCLA ranks 11th in first downs (18.9 per game). Running backs Johnathan Franklin and Derrick Coleman have combined for 1,585 yards rushing and 16 touchdowns. Kevin Prince is the top quarterback and has passed for 1,463 yards with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions.

The idea source: Holmquist bought a mobile sharpening business in 2000 from a man who sharpened shears for a haircutting business. That equipment didn't meet Holmquist's standards, so he redesigned it. After selling the new equipment online for two years -- 400 units -- Holmquist set up an unemployed friend up in the sharpening business. That worked so well that Holmquist decided to start the franchising company.
At Gyro House, everything is homemade. Well, everything except for the pita bread, which is kind of important when the word Gyro is right there in the name of your restaurant.

Now, adding another jewel to an already crowded career crown, Dion will be returning to the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for a three-year residency beginning on March 15.

I don't know what "within reason" means just yet. But if we can get a true temperature of the region and a consensus of intelligent people agree that there is legitimate value in having an NFL franchise in St. Louis, then the commission negotiators must get creative enough to entice Kroenke to stay put.
He said that finding licensed inspectors for other subspecialties is slightly trickier, and that the township is at the whim of the economy and other factors when it comes to knowing if the others will bring significant savings as well.

Denver's property taxes are the fourth-lowest in the region, nearly 25 percent below most neighboring jurisdictions. Denver has a preponderance of the region's commercial/industrial real estate.

Richard and Mayumi Heene "put on a good show for us and we bought it," Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said at a news conference Sunday.

For the iPad, they're supposed to have fantastic drawing programs. I'm sure they have software or an app that would let you pull up a score and draw all over it with a pencil and eraser, in different colors, I bet. What I wish is that I could somehow move that over to the laptop -- connect it up. That would clinch it for me, having the bigger screen.

"I guess I connect with his work because I like its meaningfulness," Heller said, "I just like that there is meaning. He's not randomly placing stuff on shelves.

"Never Fall Down" is similar to Dave Eggers' fictionalized memoir of Sudanese child soldier Valentino Achak Deng in "What Is the What," but it differs from McCormick's 2008 National Book Award finalist, "Sold." For that book she interviewed several Nepalese and Indian sex slave survivors, fusing their stories into a single, fictionalized character. "Never Fall Down" is a blend of Pond's memories and McCormick's research and imagination. "The truth," McCormick writes, "is right there between the lines."
It’s difficult to envision James becoming even better this season, given that he already appears to represent perfection in this offense.

øMy take on Boudreau is that he's a much better NHL coach today than he was when he arrived in Washington. I think he has learned on the job, and I'm betting he has learned more from his firing. He'll get the Anaheim boys going again, as hockey folks like to say. They will play with more enthusiasm because Boudreau coaches with gusto. You can bleeping count on that, as Boudreau might say.

More storms in the Texas Panhandle today, where U.S. 287 is finally open again. Motorists were trapped in muddy drifts that were waist-to-shoulder high from a severe storm. Some cars were buried in hail, with people trapped inside for a while. The storm left so much hail in its wake that workers had to use snowplows to clear the piles from the road. National Weather Service meteorologists characterized the hail as really small, but there was lots of it, accumulating from 2 to 4 feet deep.

Now, I'll hedge a little. Herbert Walberg, a member of the Hoover Institution's Koret Task Force on K-12 Education, may be the nation's foremost authority on standardized testing. Like Pia, Walberg advocates comprehensive, systematic testing across the whole curriculum  not just reading and math. He has little patience for educators and politicians who argue as Brown does.

Velasquez on Tuesday specifically prohibited Araguz from drinking alcohol and going to places where alcohol is served.
On Thursday, the Treasury Department agreed to pump $30 billion more into GM if it files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. That persuaded a group of bondholders that earlier had balked at trading $27 billion in debt for a 10 percent stake in the company to agree to a deal. Taking a 10 percent stake in a company flush with federal dollars gives them a greater chance of recouping their investments, the bondholders said.

Eighth Army troops would have pushed north through what are now dense suburbs. The hotel that Gen. Douglas MacArthur would eventually use as his headquarters is now a small building in the booming port city with the nation's tallest building and a Ferris wheel that lights up at night. History buffs can stay in the New Grand Hotel, new being 1927, where MacArthur first lived after the surrender. It was one of the few brick buildings in the area, so it survived the firebombing raids that destroyed much of the wood-and-paper structures of traditional Tokyo and Yokohama. The suite where he lived has been kept in the style of the war era and can be rented by booking well in advance.

This newest Muppet fable begins in an idyllic slice of '50s-era Americana, Smalltown, USA, with old home movies of best friends and brothers, Gary (Segel) and Walter (Walter, in an impressive acting debut).

"The U.S. Forest Service has the largest amount of parks and campgrounds in the nation. The vast majority of them are privately run and you don’t see billboards, Starbucks or any of the things some people say. Park agencies are not handing over ownership to the parks. They set the tone in leasing agreements about exactly what I can and cannot do," Meyer said.
The book wasn't supposed to be so large and encompassing, but Cockroft got lost in it during 140 hours of recorded interviews with every living player and coach. In the book, players talk vividly of the throng of some 10,000 fans who descended on Cleveland Hopkins Airport following the conclusion of a 17-14 win in Houston on Nov. 30.

Crissy Field was a military base, ramshackle buildings filling what now is celebrated open space.

The project, with its community involvement, fits the spirit of Flint's broader revitalization efforts. Mayor Dayne Walling is holding neighborhood meetings to help figure out how to use Flint's limited resources.

If the hearing commission determines that Surendra Chaganti can be sanctioned, the board can issue penalties ranging from written reprimands to revocation of his medical license.
Another factor may be stricter parental attitudes. In September, the journal Pediatrics published a widely circulated study linking shows like "SpongeBob" to kids' poor performance on tests of skills such as following rules. And some parents say they don't let their kids watch the show. Ian Guarnieri of Maplewood, N.J., says he started letting his son watch the show when he was five years old, but quickly pulled the plug. "Once we started to watch it, we decided it wasn't something we wanted him to be watching. It's very low brow."

Service is also caring and precise under Tobias Peach, whose last job was general manager of Fleur de Lys in Las Vegas. The attention to detail is evident at every turn - the heavy silver hand mirrors used as wine coasters for bottles purchased from the 1,000-plus bottle wine list, an oyster shell that snugly holds the cork, woven mats that keep the glasses and flatware from touching the bare wood tables, and even the black Converse tennis shoes worn by every black-shirted and jean-clad waiter. It all speaks to a keen sense of style.

"It doesn’t mean we didn’t get angry," he said, looking over his shoulder at Sweeney, who launched a profanity-laced tirade a few days after Christie vetoed parts of the state budget last summer. "You may even recall that even some of my friends had some very colorful nicknames for me."
Toronto had given up 12 goals in its past two games, but Scrivens stopped 38 shots in regulation and overtime to prepare for the shootout.
The result is "The Gay Debate: The Bible and Homosexuality." It's a video -- you can find it online with a simple Google search -- of a speech he gave in March at a church in Wichita that has become a minor sensation. Small wonder. Vines' speech is a masterwork of scriptural exegesis and a marvel of patient logic, slicing and dicing with surgical precision the claim that homophobia is God ordained. So effective is the video that after viewing it, Sandra Delemares, a Christian blogger from the United Kingdom who had, for years, spoken in staunch opposition to same-sex marriage, wrote that it "revolutionized" her thinking.
Liliana, who has known she wants to be a paleontologist since she was 5, stood in front of the case that holds the 66 million-year-old fossilized skull, amazed at being able to see something so old. Discovery Channel programs prepared her for the size of Samson, but she was in the minority.

Jim Kopel has been a big fan of state fairs since he was 10, when he exhibited his Chester White pigs at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Since retiring from teaching a few years ago, Kopel has visited state fairs in all 50 states, turning his ardor into something more than just happy memories.
"It's like a hidden gem," Cuevas said.
"This time it feels real," said Roland Hwang, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's transportation programs. "Automakers are serious. There's oil price shocks. The long-term trends are very positive. There will be potholes in the road as this rolls out, but there aren't any showstoppers."
They also dropped other House-passed language forcing low-income people to have Social Security numbers to get government checks by claiming the children's tax credit, a move that was aimed at illegal immigrants and caused a furor among many Hispanics.
Both Republicans and Democrats agreed Tuesday that the public must not get the idea that lawmakers are using their political influence to land lucrative jobs. But the short debate that occurred within the House Rules Committee Tuesday indicates the two parties have different ideas about how to lock the revolving door.
For years the city has banked this land, keeping it off tax rolls, in the hope that some day it could be repackaged for redevelopment. Don't expect the properties to produce much in tax revenue any time soon, though, even if Mr. McKee starts attracting actual businesses to his land.

It was hard to tear our attention away to dig into the fennel and artichoke salad ($7.75), but that, too, was captivating. Long fennel strands and thin pieces of artichoke tangle with a light lemon dressing punched up with mint.
Illinois was rock-solid in favor of including casinos among public places where smoking was prohibited, starting in 2008. But with the state's casino gambling down about 30 percent (including effects of the recession) since then, cracks are developing. The House already voted 62-52 to crush that rock altogether.
Due to the lack of proper treatment, she lost vision in one eye while in college. Since moving to Texas in 2010, she has been under the care of Greenberg, who prescribes regular, preventive immunosuppressive medications that prevented a flare-up, attack or relapse during her pregnancy with her twin boys. Gavin and Garrison turned 1 on March 24, and she continues to be in remission.

“Sure. I don’t disagree,” DeBoer said. “I’m sure we got a little bit of a lift. All of a sudden there is a heightened desperation level because your leading scorer is out and you’re facing potentially a 2-0 hole. We’ve got to keep that desperation level and that’s what we talked about. That’s got to be something that is nightly for us if we’re going to have success.”
The results were OK. But there is a sinking feeling on Wall Street that Goldman's best days are behind it. Whether the problem is new regulations, outside distractions or market forces like the prolonged slump in fixed-income trading, Goldman has simply lost its mojo, some people say.

The Senate's final passage of the bill, two weeks after the House approved it, is a welcome achievement for a president and congressional Democrats, both increasingly unpopular with voters four months from midterm elections that threaten to put Republicans in charge of Congress. Only three Republicans voted for it -- Maine Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who has said the bill is not tough enough, voted with most Republicans against it.

If you are already getting Social Security retirement or disability benefits, or railroad retirement checks, you will be contacted a few months before you become eligible for Medicare and given the information you need.
And then it wasn't.
His arrival required courage and a willingness to face change. "I quit architecture because I knew it was too late for me to start a career here in the U.S.," he says. Instead, he started doing sculpture. One day while visiting a ceramics supply store, he saw an ad by Howard Slatkin, the decorator known for opulent and highly crafted period interiors. Kanevsky answered it, and, despite having no experience or credentials, persuaded Slatkin to let him create a melon-shape porcelain tureen on spec. It took him almost two months to fabricate the object successfully. Slatkin purchased the tureen—Kanevsky's first commission.

There's no way anyone is going to downplay that "SVU" guest appearance, an intensely dramatic follow-up to a 2006 episode introducing Bridges as Darius Parker, the stepson of Detective Odafin "Fin" Tutuola (Ice-T). That episode, titled "Venom," climaxed with Darius' arrest for the brutal murder of a woman and a baby, a crime Darius said was prompted by long-simmering rage over being abandoned by his mother (guest star LisaGay Hamilton) when he was an infant. Just before the final credits rolled, Darius swore that if he had to face trial for the murders, he would bring down the rest of his family with him.
Tim Powers, a spokesman for the Colorado Bankers Association, agreed that it's unusual for banks to turn away potential customers, but he said legal and regulatory considerations have made many banks uncomfortable working with dispensaries. Federal law requires that banks not do business with companies operating illegally, and marijuana distribution — for medical purposes or not — is still illegal federally.

"People think you can kill somebody and you can walk away with a 'careless' ticket," Vence said, referring to the woman who killed her mother and only spent a few days in jail.
Having grown up in Mexico City, Rivera had no family or other ties to show business. As a teenager, she approached a popular actress filming a video on the street and asked for advice about breaking into the entertainment world. Rivera was counseled to participate in a beauty pageant and soon won a newspaper-sponsored contest. She was then cast in supporting roles in the TV melodramas known as telenovelas, beginning in the late 1980s.

It has not been an easy road for McCluer. The Comets opened with defending Class 4 state champ Webster Groves and were beaten 51-14. McCluer was better in Week 2, but still lost by three scores to a solid McCluer North team, which has lost just one game.
"All we want from you is a fair trial," Goodman told the jury. He asked the panel not to let emotional testimony from Paranzino’s friends and family, or testimony about the lifestyle of Rendfrey and his friends "prejudice you."
Director of Disaster and Emergency services for Musselshell County Jeff Gates said people are still stranded around the town. Gates said there is little emergency crews can do but provide people with supplies they need and wait for water to go down.
I suspect it is the mix of the circumstances surrounding his slaying. Among them: that his killer is white and Trayvon is black; that the wounds of slavery, Jim Crow and lynching still run deep as well as racial hatred and racial profiling, exacerbated by the denial of their continued existence.
Kurt Ramm's trumpet added a lot to the song. The song was soundchecked several times in the afternoon.
Nolan insinuates that war under George W. Bush was not approved by Congress. Who passes the bills that pay for the wars? Perhaps Nolan was confused by John Kerry — who was against the war in Iraq before he was for it — or was it the other way around?

We've started but our process is to do musical sketches and then Matt sits with them for a while. We haven't fully engaged in that yet because we've been traveling all the time. We're also a band that doesn't write very well on the road. We have to be home for a while to get out of the touring mentality. For us, it's not the most creative environment, especially Matt. His feeling is he doesn't want to write songs about being on the road like Bob Seger … even though Bob Seger is cool. [laughs]
We also managed to build a campfire. I admit that I used most of the cardboard packaging from the stuff we bought at Target, but the flames were now raging, and even prompted some personal tips from the local fireman, whose fire truck tours the campsites at night. As our fire died down to a safer level, we toasted marshmallows on sticks, made s'mores, and told ghost stories. Then we slipped into our $20 sleeping bags, which were actually very comfortable but might not have stopped our blood from freezing had the air temperature dropped below 60 degrees.
Time for the show. Heidi Klum shows up wearing a Treacy hat apparently inspired by her husband Seal's song, "Kiss From a Rose." It's a floral lump stuck to the front of her head with a stiff green stemmy thing sticking up. Treacy's hats are wonderful, exuberant art pieces, but this one looks like it came from his Everything Must Go rack.

If you're part of Odd Future's young army of fans and head to the Mint for this show, odds are you will see some instrumental fireworks and invention unlike anything you've seen. But just wait until you hear the Bad Plus, Jason Moran, Vijay Iyer and Robert Glasper, and those are just a few off the top of my head with albums from recent years. Listen to where knowledge and extension of the jazz tradition can take you, because odds are BadBadNotGood will also find out soon enough if they want to go much further.
Ashley Fox, ESPN.com: "One of the greatest quarterbacks of all time -- some would say the most technically sound man to ever play the position -- is getting cut. Peyton Manning. The assassin. The leader. The face of the Indianapolis Colts' franchise. A man so ruthless with the football that Bill Belichick, of all people, famously feared him. Cut. Gone. Done. Thanks for playing. See you in Canton. It is like the Chicago Bulls waving goodbye to Michael Jordan, or the Edmonton Oilers saying farewell to Wayne Gretzky. There are no fairy tales, not in professional sports, only reminders of how harsh a business it is. If Peyton Manning can get cut, no one in the NFL is safe."
Some 17 years after Pulp originally released the single - roughly around the same time the Sheffield, England, band last played in San Francisco - it seemed as if Cocker's wishful invocation had come true. The group having reconvened last year after a very long hiatus, anticipation for its stateside return - anchored by two Coachella appearances - was at a fever pitch. The Warfield show sold out in just 10 minutes; something that would have been highly unlikely when the group released its limp last studio album, 2001's "We Love Life."
Of course, there may be other provisions in the will that must be addressed, and your aunt may have owned other assets you haven't mentioned, so the probate may be more complicated than I have described.

While we could watch the show on our laptops through our browsers, somehow Hulu didn't have the rights to stream it directly to our TV. So, I connected my laptop to the TV. Mission accomplished, but it was a lot of effort.

That's mostly in line with what forecasters have predicted. Originally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said such debris could be expected by 2013. Newer forecasting models suggest an earlier arrival, and SOLVE asked its beach captains to report anything that seemed as though it could be tsunami-related.

Just ask the Mets, who dug themselves out of a three-run hole in the seventh only to see Schafer get the Astros going an inning later with another key hit.
For players such as Colby Rasmus, Trever Miller and Ryan Franklin, who spent part of the season with the club before being traded or released, the players decided to award partial shares. Each player received a pro-rated amount based on the time they spent with the team. The same measure was used to determine the amount awarded minor leaguers who contributed to the team during the regular season but did not appear in the postseason.
The jersey's dominant navy was inspired by Puget Sound; its "action green" accent, brighter than what was used previously, echoes the area's fauna. The "wolf grey" is a nod to the frequent color of the sky, particularly on an autumn game day. And the white, besides serving as an accent, owes its larger meaning with the nearby snow-capped Cascade peaks.
GM Chris Antonetti said he initially talked to Scott Boras, Damon's agent, before the start of spring training. Once spring training started, Antonetti said he looked to improve the Indians through trades. Toward the end of camp, Antonetti turned his attention back to free agents such as Damon.
Columbus is a good place to do it. Let him stay there for as long as possible. This is probably the only way the Indians are going to reap any return from him as the key player in the CC Sabathia deal in 2008. For whatever reason, the Indians deemed LaPorta to be major-league ready shortly after they made the deal. They deemed wrong.
Do Re Mi House (8199 Clairemont Mesa Blvd. Kearny Mesa. 858-565-2085) is my go to for Korean. Some of the friendliest owners and staff out there, and that always makes for a great experience. Their banchan (side dishes) are lavish, the ggae ran jeem (egg soufflé) comes hot and bubbling to your table. The raw crab is one of my favorites. The black cod is a winner - so are their tofu soups. The complimentary cinnamon tea at the end of the meal, is spot on. Trivia: Cinnamon allegedly lowers blood-sugar levels and in Korea is used to treat people with diabetes. - Andrew Spurgin, chef/partner Campine – A Culinary + Cocktail Conspiracy
Meanwhile, James can only watch and wonder what's next as Orlando reaches the NBA Finals after building around Howard and the Lakers make a repeat trip to the Finals with Kobe Bryant as their anchor. The failure of the Cavaliers -- and the success of Orlando and the Lakers -- shows James cannot carry the team by himself.
But behind the scenes, another game was being played Tuesday, and it was quite the nail-biter for Blazers management.

Claire McCaskill, offering reasons why she voted with her Democratic colleagues, said: "If we're going to keep this economic recovery moving in the right direction, then we've got to make college more affordable and accessible and make sure our kids and grandkids can compete for the jobs of the future. That's what this fight is all about."
The 300 Line runs through northern Pennsylvania and into Sussex, Passaic and Bergen counties, through the heart of the New Jersey Highlands, and Tennessee Gas won approvals this summer to construct what is called a "loop" or new 30-inch line, between Wantage Township in Sussex County and West Milford in Passaic County.
In some cases, the various players in a big news event have sold their stories to different producers. But for the nearly simultaneous teen-science, body-switch and killer-asteroid movies of a few years ago, the only plausible explanation is willful treachery.

In fact, only the lead acting categories might offer reasons enough to stay up extra late. That said, look for Kate Winslet ("The Reader") to beat out Meryl Streep ("Doubt") for Best Actress, and comeback kid Mickey Rourke ("The Wrestler") to edge Sean Penn ("Milk"), et al, as Best Actor.

The story unfolds in a gorgeous world created by scenic designer Simon Pastukh, costume designer Galina Solovyeva, lighting designer Brad Fields and projection designer Wendall K. Harrington. Kaschei's realm is spooky: gnarled trees that sprout menacing branches tipped with glowing red buds. Solovyeva's costumes, especially her Firebirds, contain just the right amount of homage to Fokine's work (and not too many feathers, thank goodness). Harrington's projections are haunting and evocative, though opening night was marred by a few cueing glitches.
