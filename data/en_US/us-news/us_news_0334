It's a concert film of the spoken word, with the accent on recollections, rather than onstage performance.

Hinds' comments: "It was one of those perfect games (the victory over Hamilton). The kids came out loose and focused. You could tell that week, they were real focused and determined after the first time we played them. That didn't sit well with them. I was surprised they came out pretty confident. Talking to them later, I asked, 'Did you believe you could do it?' They said, 'Yeah, we did.' ... I was not sure how it would go down. I don't know if I'm surprised. It was a pleasant surprise how well we did in the trenches."
"As for this coming Last Thursday, given that all of the public communication and planning around the event has indicated that street closures would be in effect from 6-10 p.m. through September and the public understanding is such, it would be impractical from an implementation perspective to try and shift the timing at this late date."
Levitan tried to say that the meeting was just the beginning of a process of soliciting community input about the recommendations.

I'm not a fan of some of the pasta dishes. The pasta in the carbonara ($15), with organic eggs, sweet onions and smoked prosciutto, tasted like chewy pellets. On the other hand, the ricotta gnocchi ($14) are like a dozen tiny souffles, gently napped in a fresh-tasting tomato sauce with pecorino cheese. Veal tortelli ($15) is also a winner, with the packets of pasta shimmering in a bronzed meat broth with cubes of butternut squash sauteed in brown butter and fried sage leaves.

Truth be told, I haven't been tracking feminist hermeneutics too closely. I'm sure you'd agree, Amanda, that encouraging strong female role models is an important part of feminism. But in a world where mainstream feminists almost unanimously backed Bill Clinton during the Paula Jones scandal and now excoriate McCain for choosing Palin, I'm not totally clear on what feminism entails -- if not simply support for the Democratic Party.
"You get off the ice and right now, you just wait and see how it is," Steen said after practice. "I'm not going to diagnose myself every minute of practice or every minute of the day.

Van Gogh (1853-90) sold hardly any of his art during his lifetime, and on his death at age 37 his paintings were deemed nearly worthless in Paris. On the other side of the Rhine, however, the artist was seen as a Nietzschean hero whose blazing canvases—"screaming in horror to the heavens," as the critic Julius Meier-Graefe put it—seemed to anticipate an age in which art had replaced faith. Along with Meier-Graefe, who had become enamored of the French Impressionists while living in Paris in the 1890s, other instigators of the German Van Gogh cult included the socially connected Count Harry Kessler, the powerful art dealer Paul Cassirer and the shipping heiress Helene Müller, who quickly amassed a collection (now housed in the Kröller-Müller museum in the Netherlands) that was exceeded only by the artist's own estate.

Aside from the "Viva Gordita!" running through my head, Taqueria la Pasadita and its best-in-town take on taqueria fare couldn't be further from a Taco Bell, even though it lives in a building that was one. It's as good as they say - maybe even better.

There were also many winning plays. The lobster "knuckle sandwich" ($16) and the Creole midnight snack ($12) appetizers were memorable in presentation and flavor. The knuckle sandwich spread a generous portion of lobster across an elongated piece of baguette, with a tangle of sprouts and a hint of tarragon for accents. The midnight snack was comfort-food genius: three large shrimp coated with a mustard-spiced rémoulade and topped with a freshly poached egg, all seated on a butter-fried piece of thick, fluffy bread.

I have been praying for speed cameras on the stretch of the Jones Falls Expressway that I regularly travel — between North Avenue and Ruxton Road and sometimes on to the Beltway. I have been tailgated so close that I can't even see the headlights of the SUV or car behind me. I've seen tow trucks with cars on them going over 70 in the far left lane as I near my exit and dump trucks spewing trash as they speed past. I've seen tour buses going well over 60 as they head south past North Avenue. I've often seen two cars or trucks tailgating and weaving in and out of lanes without signals — apparently in a race with each other — that actually disappear from sight within 40 or 50 seconds. Where are these speed cameras when we need them?

A: Let all of your expectations go. The truth is, you may not be the best, but art is about finding the outlet for your soul. The reality about good art and bad art is not how much heart goes into something, it is about the skill that the individual has.

By contrast, the changeable nature of sunlight and wind mean that a solar plant delivers less than 20 percent of its rated peak capacity even if it is in the sunny Southwest, and a wind farm delivers less than 30 percent of its potential.

That was in December 2010. Ken signed up and happily paid $59.99 a month for the first year. But this past December, Ken got a shock. Sprint took advantage of some tiny print in his contract that says they can change the terms of the contract at any time. Suddenly, Ken's data charges were more than three times what they used to be, resulting in eye-popping monthly phone bills around $400.

The series features two of major junior hockey's hottest goaltenders in Portland's Mac Carruth, a seventh-round pick by Chicago in the 2010 NHL draft, and Edmonton's Laurent Brossoit, a sixth-round pick by Calgary in 2011. Carruth, who has a franchise record 30 playoff victories in 47 appearances over three seasons, stopped 154 of 164 shots in the Winterhawks' four-game sweep of Tri-City in the Western Conference championship series. "I wouldn't necessarily put any more pressure on Mac than anybody else on our team, but he definitely has been a solid piece of the puzzle for us," Hawks defenseman Joe Morrow said. "He's been playing fantastic, and consistency out of him is a huge thing for us."

-- You know, I certainly can't laud the defensive coordinator for this one but I'm having trouble killing him as well. Watching live, I could see the Giants played a good bit of Cover-3 zone and Brees hit them where it hurt. The 20-yard pass to Moore on the first drive and the 23-yard corner route to Graham after somebody ran the corner up the field showed how Brees and a good vertical passing game can hit those seam and sideline gaps. But after that, Fewell made some adjustments and the Giants actually got the ball back after man coverage on three passes forced incompletions on two of them: a pass defensed by Webster and a ball on which Brees just missed Graham, who was covered well by LB Jacquian Williams. After that, it was just a matter of guys getting beat: Ross on a 21-yard in cut by WR Devery Henderson, S Kenny Phillips on a 22-yard out route to Sproles on which Phillips missed a tackle, LB Mark Herzlich in a mismatch on Henderson for 24 yards to set up the second touchdown and Webster on his whiff on Colston to lead to the third TD. I said in the game preview, the Giants had no shot of playing a lot of zone and they had to trust their guys to make plays. They did, and the players didn't get it done. And I don't just mean the guys covering because, when you play man, you need your pass rush to help you. The guys up front did not do that.

Seeing that Davis might swat away his shot, Johnson tried to pump fake but came down and dropped the ball for a double dribble.

Parker pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and offenses against a human corpse. Parker had told her mother that Kaliyah was living with her paternal grandmother.

For much of the 1980s, beginning when I was in college, I used to read a Hemingway book a year.

The institute and the Actors Studio, it should be noted, are separate institutions. Strasberg was the artistic director of the Studio from 1951 until his death in 1982, and it is here where his influence on members such as Kim Stanley, Rod Steiger, Geraldine Page, Paul Newman and, later, Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino brought about a sea change in American acting. Twice weekly for many years, Strasberg would preside over sessions, in which members, working on scenes, would receive feedback from the high chieftain. But the Studio wasn't designed to develop talent the way a conservatory can.

"Damsels in Distress" is the fourth film (and the first since 1998) by Whit Stillman, who as a younger man looked like F. Scott Fitzgerald and spoke like someone who had learned the language out of sophisticated comic novels. He made a kind of movie nobody else was making, about rich and privileged young people moving in the very best circles — which is to say, their own. He called them the "urban haute bourgeoisie." They consider "yuppie" a term of praise. His "Metropolitan" (1989), about a young man hoping to win acceptance from such snobs, was a considerable hit, in part because no one had seen a movie like it unless possibly running in black and white at 3 a.m. on TCM. Then came "Barcelona" (1994) and "The Last Days of Disco" (1998). What they have in common is that the supporting cast of a Fred Astaire comedy could wander in and not be noticed.

The original "Coriolanus" layered on an abundance of conflicts for Martius to grapple with. Even with Logan's surgical streamlining of the play, more than enough remains. There are the great expectations of an autocratic mother, Volumnia (Redgrave), coupled with pressure from his ambitious political ally, Menenius (Cox). There is his sworn enemy, guerrilla fighter Tullus (Butler), who is both nemesis and savior. And testing his patience at every turn is the constituency of ordinary citizens that Martius disdains.
