"Our legal counsel told us this will never fly -- it's unconstitutional," said Sawyer, who served eight terms in the U.S. House and is now a state senator. "I said, 'I know that. You know that. They probably know that -- but it's a question of time.' If they can't act quickly, they'll lose value."
No longer able to afford basic necessities, the unemployed and underemployed are turning to food pantries filled with free canned and boxed goods, and maybe meats, eggs and produce, depending on the site and the season.

Perhaps the best example of Vongerichten’s quest to make Korean food more accessible to the American palate is the kimchi hot dog — thinly sliced kimchi tempered with honey and rice vinegar topping a grilled frank. When Vongerichten moved in with her husband, she brought along her 1-gallon bucket of kimchi, and Jean-Georges admits he was knocked out at first by the funk in the fridge, though he has since come around.

Officers responding to the call that morning found Goldson, 64, who had just returned from Florida, dead in her garage. An autopsy revealed the cause was blunt force trauma. Smith was indicted on the charges in November, and will be back in court Feb. 1. His public defender, John McMahon, would not comment.
But looking up from the weeds at the clouds, McCarthy has a dismaying desire to bring a "futurist" to speak to the Republican caucus each week. This betrays an unconservative faith in prophets -- pursuing prophecy is a recipe for forfeiting the present -- and is a depressing reminder of Speaker Newt Gingrich's swoon about Alvin Toffler's books "Future Shock" and "The Third Wave." Gingrich said of himself, oxymoronically, "I am a conservative futurist." Fascination with clairvoyants is, however, symptomatic of an unconservative hankering to surf supposed "waves" of history, and to put government in the service of, and society in harness to, Big Ideas.

Manufacturing is doing quite well. One sector that didn't add jobs is government, which is still adjusting to tight budgets and probably will for some time. 8.3 percent unemployment is still terrible. There are almost 13 million unemployed. There are 5 million long-term unemployed. But if the unemployment rate descends to the low-7-percent range by November, it will substantially improve the Democrats' chances to hold on to the White House.

Ross alluded to several veteran players drawing a line in the sand during the charter flight to Minneapolis last Sunday night. The Red Sox are built to be a playoff contender, and the way they played through the season's first two weeks, they looked nothing like that.
​The former Seabra’s — one of Newark’s perennially popular restaurants — is now known as Rio Rodizio, and the name is a clue to the main attraction: the nonstop orgy of grilled meats known as rodizio. It’s all-you-can-eat meat, and it’s up to you to tell the waiter no mas. There’s an enormous salad in case you’re striving for nutritional balance. I’ll say this: If you don’t add rodizio to your NCAA tournament eating resume — whether here or at one of the Ironbound restaurants — you’ll be all the poorer.
At Thursday's Chicago Live!, a weekly stage and radio show presented at the Chicago Theatre Downstairs, Tribune transportation reporter Jon Hilkevitch, Ethan Spotts of the Active Transportation Alliance and Brian Steele of the Chicago Department of Transportation will discuss what changes are needed for drivers and bicyclists to get along better and share the road.

ø- Like Plural Eyes, Apple wants to sync up the various cameras (you can use up to 9 cameras) by using the audio to line them up. But what if, say, you have great sound on camera #1, but the other cameras are using the natural sound provided by their internal (and usually very lousy) microphones? If so, you don't do as well. You will need to put a microphone - a shotgun, a lavalier - anything, to help each camera record sound if you want Apple's Multicamera option to perform at its best.

Brooke: I consider myself a big feeder. I feed Kelly a lot in clutch situations. That’s mostly when we have our connection, at the end of games or when goals are really needed. I’m a feeder, but she’s definitely more of a finisher.
In fact, I can hardly write about it (for the millionth time) without curling up under my desk in the fetal position. It sickens me to experience the slow impoverishment of Oregon and the rapid disinvestment in my kids' generation. My kids don't deserve this. They deserve a full school year, a full week of Outdoor School and a full platoon of librarians, music teachers and counselors. They deserve the sun and moon and stars, or at least a school with a working drinking fountain.
Two-thirds of American adults are obese or overweight, raising their risk of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The FDA hasn't approved a new prescription drug for long-term weight loss since Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG's Xenical in 1999. New diet pills from Mountain View, Calif.-based Vivus Inc., and Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Orexigen Therapeutics Inc., both based in San Diego, are now under review at the FDA.
Not bad. But it's still less than a drop in the bucket. And in terms of a business, Foursquare is probably still light years behind Where, which has been around for five years and has become profitable by developing a service for sites such as Pandora that uses a person's location to offer ads for nearby businesses. It's less trendy than check-ins (which Where does have), but it's the more robust business for the moment. And it makes Where's future look more plausible.
"It's hard to image a more compatible musical partner," Shearing said after Torme died in 1999. "I humbly put forth that Mel and I had the best musical marriage in many a year. We literally breathed together during our countless performances." And he told Down Beat magazine: "Mel was one of the few people that I played with whom I felt I worked with and not for."

Educational attainment, the ability to save or gain assets and neighborhood poverty impact economic mobility, Currier says.
Denise also shared with me that she is more careful now about whom she invests time in. While she kept the circle of those who knew about her husband's affair small (wise girl), she saw some friends treat her marriage like something to be thrown away. So she's more thoughtful now about who's a part of her life, meaning those she lets influence her, on a day-to-day basis.

After the team went through a rare practice at Bankers Life Fieldhouse Monday, the mood was cautiously optimistic. A realist might point out that the Wizards have the third-worst record in the league.

Day 61. Did she become a man because she was "trapped in a woman's body," as she explained, or to hurt me? I have to wonder, since she ratcheted back to a woman before the final phase. That's a lot of hormone injections when we needed to replace the roof. "Isn't it the sort of thing you wanted to be sure of?" I ask her one night. She just hides inside her giant McCullough. I turn out the lights and say, "G'nite, Jane John Jane."

• Allow business owners to offset taxes on gains from one of their businesses with losses from another, and to carry forward those losses for 20 years (S1540). The State Division of Taxation estimates it will mean as much as $400 million in annual lost revenue, though sponsor Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) called that figure "overly aggressive."

“This group is very mentally tough,” guard Mike Conley said. “We've had to handle adversity all year long with injuries and guys being in and out of the lineup.”
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, was invited to testify but declined. She signed SB 1070 into law and has blasted the Obama administration for seeking to overturn the statute.
"It's tough, but we just have to play with the guys out there," Aldridge said. "We've been faced with injury every year, but I think if guys are working as a team and working to get better, it shouldn't matter who is out there."
To accommodate January Jones' pregnancy while filming began on Season 5 (and probably to give her a better storyline this year), the writers have decided to make her big. How big? I mean, she's not HUGE. She's, well, like medium-muumuu territory. I must say that January Jones never seemed to sport a double-chin while really pregnant, so I'm assuming there's some clever makeup/prosthetics going on here.

That's strong enough to calm fears of another recession. Still, growth would have to be nearly twice as high -- consistently -- to make a major dent in the unemployment rate, which has been stuck near 9 percent for more than two years.

"We need to know that although we’re talking about something that happened in 1865, we’re still struggling," she said. "It’s very important for us to make sure our children understand what Juneteenth is all about."
The threat was that the Colts could, from a huddle close to the line of scrimmage, start the play immediately, preventing defenses from constantly changing personnel and forcing them to try quickly to decipher what Manning might do. Generally, though, Manning would change the play (audiblize) at the line of scrimmage, shout out a fake play, move his receivers, recognize where the blitz would come from and await his linemen's blocking assignments' call. The actual play preparation could take up most of the 40-second clock.
Jeffrey Stenroos, the former Los Angeles school police officer who staged his own shooting last year in a bizarre hoax that caused three schools to be locked down and forced the closure of streets across the western San Fernando Valley, will pay the city a lump sum of $309,000 in restitution, authorities said Monday.

The sun hadn’t yet set when the headlining band began playing at Maplewoodstock. It was bright and warm in Memorial Park, and the sky behind the outdoor stage was still a clear blue. Face-painted kids shared food with grown-ups on beach blankets, and a gentle breeze cut the heat at the annual outdoor festival. From the crowd at the bottom of the Memorial Park hill to the food and craft vendors who’d set up across from the train station, all faces turned to the stage, where New Jersey’s own Smithereens serenaded the bucolic township of Maplewood with songs about jealousy, paranoia and romantic obsession.
He addressed a lot of questions about his age. Weeden will be 29 about a month into his rookie NFL season.

It's obvious in the name -- this joint is all about racking it up on one of the many pool tables. You're bound to see lots of hotties in the process, considering the bar is a favorite among ASU students because of its primo spot on Mill Avenue. Cue Club also features pool tournaments, so grab a group of your best-playing friends to compete. The Long Islands are pretty potent here. After a few, prepare to probably not win many pool games.

enthusiasts tend to obsess about their first-round draft pick. Do you go with Adrian Peterson or Chris Johnson with the top pick? What about Arian Foster? Is the middle of the round too early for Aaron Rodgers? Should you grab an elite receiver at the end?
But Timmins and the board rebuffed Peterson's advances and shut him down at the company's annual meeting in June, refusing to respond to his suggestions or answer his questions. Peterson stopped campaigning for change, though he held on to his stock.
This live-action confectionary was, in part, a visual joke about the sort of music that Perry makes — pure daydream pop for teenagers, young forever and craving something sweet. "Teenage Dream," her million-selling second album, was literally bubblegum-scented. As niches go, it’s a big one: Perry’s teen-girl audience handily sold out the arena. She has released five singles from "Teenage Dream," four of which have hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart. (The other may well be on it its way.) It is reasonable to argue that her candy-coated melodies and chewing-gum dreams have made her the biggest pop star in America.
A few years back, Radio Shack came under fire for using an e-mail to lay off about 400 workers. "Unfortunately your position is one that has been eliminated," the message said.

It was the fourth such adventure Danielson has put together since 2009.
1. If you don't feel polished without foundation or powder, do that first. You're probably wondering what this has to do with your eyes, but smoothing out an uneven skin tone will make whatever color you apply to your face pop. And you apply foundation and powder around the eye to diminish dark shadows and wrinkles. This step takes me less than a minute because I dot on a liquid concealer with clean finger tips and blend, blend, blend, done.

"The Knitter's Life List" (Storey Publishing), by Gwen W. Steege, is a different beast altogether: It's an illustrated compendium of patterns, resources, tips and artist profiles. The author hopes to entice knitters to explore, so she suggests places to go and movies to watch and unusual techniques. The book requires some sitting time to dig into its depths.

I'd be hard-pressed to find a better guy to trust. On my visits, not really knowing the difference between the Schiava grape found in the 2009 Mumelter Sudtirol St. Magdalener (which retails for about $17) and the Teroldego grape in the 2006 Roberto Zeni Rotaliano (which retails for about $23), I turned to the staff for assistance for this choice and others.

But Bertolucci tries to keep a broader view. If someone is listening to another station, they're not listening to KFI, and she wants to know why. The goal is for KFI hosts to cover a broad enough spectrum of topics to hook listeners of all types. Grab them with a discussion of the tension between stay-at-home moms and working mothers, or the story of a black Labrador retriever who refused to leave the side of its dead fellow Lab, and hopefully they won't be punching buttons to hear what's playing on KIIS or KOST.
"Harry pretty much invented the idea of the Latino think-tank," said institute director Roberto Suro, who had founded the rival Pew Hispanic Center in Washington in 2001. "The targeted work he did was very original. He produced a lot of imitators, and I say that as one of them."
But at the same time, Jack Britt is concerned. His son’s on-field performance — he had 42 receptions for 775 yards and nine touchdowns last season, despite missing four games with a hamstring injury — has shown he can be a dominant NFL receiver.

The debacle begins in Manhattan, with George in a well-paying job he hates and Linda working on her latest project, a bummer of a documentary on why penguins are dying.

In the 20th century, women writers seemed especially drawn to utopianism. In Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 novel "Herland," a society of women has been living—and reproducing parthenogenetically—for almost 2,000 years: "Everything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness, and the pleasantest sense of home over it all." The women were, in the description of three male explorers who stumbled into their world, "in the full bloom of rosy health, erect, serene, standing sure-footed and light as any pugilist."

Don't bother looking for Richard Nixon's old Western White House; he sold it in 1980, and it's a private home now. The town is tucked in among hills and canyons — no tidy street grid here — and on the main drag, El Camino Real, many locals like Sonny's (an old favorite for pizza at 429 N. El Camino Real) and the Riders Club Cafe (a new favorite for burgers and other "slow fast food" at 1701 N. El Camino Real). But you're starting with the pier.

Politics: Check out an analysis of this year's Clackamas County Board of Commissioner's race in today's newspaper.

Brown criticizes Munoz for voting to privatize Chicago's parking meters, a vote he now admits was a mistake. He also was criticized in 2009 when he acknowledged his daughter was admitted to Whitney Young Magnet High School after he called the principal to ask that an initial decision not to admit her be overturned. Munoz said he made 10 to 15 such calls a year on behalf of constituents.

It is one of several books on the royal romance in the works.

She contends that because the board meets only twice a month, directors are not sufficiently engaged in policy decisions. Some directors are more involved than others, she allows. But because the board is designed to be run "like a corporation with directors who have other careers,'' she said, the board has historically been guided by its staff. "It's really easy for the board not to pay attention" to suicide barrier pleas, she continued, "because suicides have become so routine, and the staff is definitely not agitating for it.''

The screenwriters, who control everything (Mr. Goddard got his start on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," the TV series created by Mr. Whedon), have filled their film with big ideas. "The Cabin in the Woods" simultaneously celebrates and deconstructs the genre's conventions, while touching on questions of ethics as they apply to reality shows, and free will as it applies to all of us contestants in the game of real life, clinging as we do to the belief that we run our own shows. Yet the initial brilliance of the premise is eventually dulled by illogic, the whole thing proves unmanageable and the filmmakers unmanage their climactic revelation with far more zest than finesse.

Stoudemire was treated for a laceration to his hand after Monday's 104-94 loss to the Heat, which sunk the Knicks into a 2-0 hole in their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series.
These are, in various subtle ways, recognizably images by a generation of artists who came of age during the first decade of the Castro regime. Modernist in feeling, many are also magical realist in tone, with strongly poetic readings of Cuban-based themes. But, as in such novels as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude," the poetry tends to be inflected with ironic, bone-deep political and social skepticism.

"Sure," I said.
But even as nine other states were holding caucuses or primaries, both Romney and Santorum focused their energies on the Buckeye State in the final days.

But if somehow Ohio Republicans opted for the Electoral College "reform" that Pennsylvania's debating, Ohio's congressional districts could make Obama's 2012 re-election tougher, too. (Risky prediction: His 2012 Republican GOP foe will be Texas Gov. Rick Perry.)
Other ventures off-property included West End, the hip, dusty little town at the end of the island and a 15-minute drive from AKR. Although all meals were included in our dive package, we sometimes went for dinner at one of several excellent restaurants. Tongs Thai Island Cuisine was our favorite. The liveliest bar scene was at Sundowners, but that required leaving the kids behind on movie night. The shopping in West End erred toward the hippie: parachute silk pants, kites, wind chimes, that sort of thing, but the Lenca pottery, with beautiful black and white geometric designs made by Honduran highland women, was worth the drive.

To rev up the stateliness factor in what remained, at its core, the Cohens' mid-1960s ranch home, Birkhead added molding, layers upon layers of it, to ceilings, walls, on doors and above them, too. Throughout the house, he also added more color - green in the kitchen, for example, to match an existing countertop - and darkened the existing wooden floors.

In 1996 leadership passed to Jo Carole Lauder, the wife of Ronald Lauder; she steered the foundation away from simply supplying loaner art to diplomatic residences and instead toward building a permanent collection at American embassies in more than 140 countries. Lauder quickly transformed what had been an elite, rarefied program into something more accessible and democratic. "Embassies are the visible face of our country," says Yale's fast-talking dean of art, Robert Storr, who moonlights as chairman of the organization's professional fine arts committee and guides its curatorial mission. "The art installed in and around those government buildings allows foreigners to have a glimpse of our cultural production."

Roberts concludes "Pavane" with a somewhat problematic coda, one that compels the reader to think again about the action of the novel and of the church's role in it. He also suggests that history is governed by a kind of eternal recurrence, that once before, "beyond all the memories of men, there was a great civilization" that rose and flourished until there came "a burning, an Armageddon."

I did that Sept. 1 and never heard another word. I called again and was told he can't be reached by phone. What can I do?

As the league continues to look for ways to produce and market Thursday's draft as a premier American sports event where everyone except the Oakland Raiders can usually claim victory, one idea to grow even more grassroots support would be to take the show on the road.Cleveland one year.

The problems with gas begin with getting it out of the ground. Companies roll into a town or rural community, set up massive drilling rigs, and then grind through soil, rock and drinking water aquifers to reach the gas deposits. Next comes the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, where millions of gallons of water mixed with sand, and a potentially toxic cocktail of chemicals, is pumped at high pressure into tiny cracks, breaking up the rock and releasing the gas. Not surprisingly, this violent process is known to contaminate drinking water, release huge amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane into the air, disrupt life in local communities and create vast cleanup problems.

Viognier, pronouced vee-oh-NYAY, is a well-respected grape that was once difficult to find because little of it was grown.

Although it was once expensive, Viognier wines are now being produced in various parts of the world and can be found at affordable prices.

In Haditha, after an improvised explosive device killed a popular Marine, 24 Iraqi noncombatants were killed. The Marine battalion commander denied the possibility of his men's criminality and failed to make sufficient inquiry into their actions, multiple investigations allege.

South Carolina voters also clearly explained why. Exit polls showed that Mr. Romney's two (and only) messages—that he is the best suited to turn around the economy and to defeat Barack Obama—aren't working for the majority of voters.

With all that, his terraced garden, a collaboration with Denise Moscarella of Garden Scape Design, won't need much irrigation: "It shouldn't require any after a few years.

“You could take the average fan and say: ‘You’ve got a minute, walk through the front door of the Yankee clubhouse and, on the same day, walk through the Diamondback clubhouse," Towers said. "You can’t say anything, just evaluate what’s going on, walk through the room, down the steps, into the dugout and out, and you tell me which one’s a winner and which one’s not.’ Even if they had their name tags covered, it’d be easy.

"I think we're prepared for a bunch of different scenarios, and it allows us to proceed with caution. But I think we are really prepared for any situation," general manager Ozzie Newsome said. "At 29, I think the best way to start off is you have to have 29 players because you can't control the other 28. So, if you're on the clock and 29 players have been taken, you have to be ready to take that 29th if the phone call [with a trade offer] doesn't come."
Of course, some of you won't be able to wait. For that bunch, Barnes & Noble at Desert Ridge Marketplace is having a party at 7p.m. Wednesday, March 21. Ah, bookstores -- remember them?

Today, I again thought about what fairness means in a time of transition. For years, we as a country allowed and in many ways encouraged illegal immigration. We were not really serious about securing our borders and reaped the benefit of cheap labor.

If Notre Dame's press release is any indication, it could require sweeping change at the top in South Bend before anything truly changes.

The two-day break between games gave coach Mike Babcock the opportunity to give the team Wednesday off.
Time Warner's cable TV networks, which include CNN, TBS, TNT and HBO, saw revenue grow 3 percent to $3.6 billion. The company benefited from strong ad rates, better timing of the March Madness basketball games and higher fees collected from U.S. cable and satellite TV distributors to carry the channels. That was offset partly by a decrease in content revenue; last year's quarter got a boost from licensing HBO's "Sex and the City" to other cable outlets in the U.S.
Writing for the court, Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor found that "a criminal sentence is final upon the issuance of a final order" and that Ohio lawmakers tied the hands of judges when they passed the so-called truth-in-sentencing law in 1996, which repealed the section of law that had allowed the leeway to modify sentences.
Wood-fired items like the bison and the rabbit are served, attractively, with an enveloping puree of caramelized sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts and slivers of crisp green apples. The bison, sourced locally, as much of the menu is, was lusciously buttery and full flavored. The rabbit entree, a standout, comprises a cornmeal-breaded loin, a delicate and milky rabbit sausage and a confit made from the rabbit forelegs. It's the kind of dish you'll find yourself thinking about.

Grand jurors heard two days of testimony. By the end, Shadel could recite the police bureau's use-of-force policies -- and felt almost as bad for the officer as the man he killed. If Walters had known Collins threatened to kill two people or been seen with blood on his hands, he never would have confronted him alone, Shadel says. Two witnesses each thought the other had passed that information along.

I'm not so sure. Ultimately, large government checks can and will buy influence. Here's another concern: Many of these programs would require the government, for the first time, to decide who is a journalist. Does the guy who blogs about local government in his pajamas qualify for the same tax credit as this newspaper's City Hall reporter?

That's true enough, but it doesn't directly answer the question of whether the race was worth the effort. To some degree, it's too early to answer that question. The event will be back next year, and organizers hope for at least three more years after that. Much of the effort and expense for the city to host the race was front-loaded on the first year, and the benefits are likely to grow as it becomes more established. Even if the figures Messrs. Coates and Friedman produced are right, it remains plausible that Baltimore will at least recoup its investment over the life span of the event.
Likewise with Hell's Kitchen, she added, "We didn't have a plan, we didn't have the money, we didn't have that sophisticated investor. But what we did have was an organically-grown, one-of-a-kind jewel, some guerrilla marketing skills ... and guts."

"It goes to show that our system at Maryland worked," Dickerson said. "It worked in the ACC. It worked in going to two Final Fours and winning the national championship, and it worked for Jimmy to get him a situation where he won 24 games and was coach the year in his conference."
Confident that encounters like his are the exception, I extended our stay to sample a vacationer's summer experience of Glacier and in the process discovered that the park is a glorious combination of the raw and the cooked, the wild and the civilized, a place where the hand of man is surprisingly at home in a world teeming with predators and untrammeled nature.

The toll hike has already been publicly questioned by the two governors with the power to block it.

Yeah, the same story that’s been said the first couple of years. In the very beginning of the season, you started to see validation of the previous commentaries, that what we’ve been saying all along, that it’s part of the building process, that it takes time but they’re the foundation of it. We’ve surrounded ourselves with kids who could believe in what would be, who know exactly what it is. To be able to have that kind of success that we had, it’s validation. It makes you truthful.
"Rich would get down over the ball, and there's the nose guard, and Rich is talking to him, wanting to know how his family and kids are doing," recalled former Rams guard Dennis Harrah with a laugh.

He's assigned to be a stringer while Saddler, who has gone missing, was a star reporter. Saddler has been to all the world's hot spots, always at the right times. He looms so large in the minds of the reporters that they sit around the Rat trying not to mention him — going less than 10 minutes at a time.
The United States has a lot to gain from crafting immigration policies that secure the border, meet labor needs, honor human dignity and enhance economic growth. But the sad political truth is that Obama can also gain simply by making a speech that will please the Latino voters he will need in 2012 and then blaming the Republicans in Congress when nothing happens.
"But did I think I'd build an empire this size? The answer is no."
Schwartz told jurors that Google was free to use the Java programming language and related elements known as application programming interfaces, or APIs, which Oracle has claimed as proprietary technology.

That is the only possible explanation for why that city coughed up another $25 million to cover the operating losses of the Phoenix Coyotes and keep that troubled franchise in town for another year. That must be one of the few local governments flush with cash during these tough economic times.
A student of the so-called golden age of early 20th century course architecture, Strantz admired Alister MacKenzie, the creator of Augusta National and Cypress Point. This Englishman believed that every good hole should look harder than it is. A golf course may be a faux battlefield with a cold one as close as your cart's mini-cooler, but the player still wants a sense of accomplishment, the pride of conquest -- or at least survival.
