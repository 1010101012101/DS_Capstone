Let me be clear, like Mr. Smith, I am no fan of President Obama, but wasting ink talking about his failed promises on Guantanamo and such merely diverts our eyes from the salient problems facing us.

Based on what Montero showed in 61 at bats for the Yankees last season (.328, four home runs), not to mention a different style (translated: more aggressive) of hitting than just about anyone on the Yankee roster, it would be hard to see Cashman parting ways with the 21-year old.

When Steve Miller worked in as the second-team Leo rush end and got a touch sack on backup quarterback Kenny Guiton, Miller got a flying chest bump from defensive line coach Mike Vrabel.
The dog's name is Freeway. That part I will never forget. I will remember it echoing forlornly on mountain trails and forest thickets, on the banks of streams, on basketball courts, behind gas stations and along highways. "Freeway! Freeway! Freeeee-way! Where are you, boy? Freeway!"

The details that Karr has described, he said, are widely available.
The book is as much an ode to Moby Dick and small colleges as it is to baseball. When I finished the book I realized that this wasn't a book about baseball as much as it was baseball as a book. The pace of the book is like a baseball game. There's that early feeling out period as the pitcher gets to know his stuff (the author gets to know his writing) and the hitters get a feel for the pitcher (the reader gets to know the characters). There are lulls, where things slow down, move almost laboriously. And then, something happens. A surprise, perhaps. A plot twist. And then you realize there wasn't a lull at all. It was prelude to action. One of the reasons why I enjoy baseball is because of that sustained tension, and The Art of Fielding captures that, especially as Skrimshander comes to grip with his yips.

Collins said he tried to prepare Harvey for the demotion, but was not annoyed to learn the pitcher was upset. “This kid believes he’s ready to pitch in the big leagues,” Collins said. “He threw 75 pitches in a minor league game on Wednesday and the last pitch was 96 miles per hour. And his makeup is off the charts. Even the way he handled the rookie treatment, he just went along with it. That speaks volumes to the veterans.”

Writer Peter Kaminsky has lived off the fat of the land as a reviewer of untapped New York ethnic eateries, while also journeying through France with Daniel Boulud and researching his tome on the gastronomic majesty of swine. The embarrassment of richness caught up with him, and his doctor advised that he lose some serious poundage. His newest book, "Culinary Intelligence," proves that a delicious bite can be had at any price point or calorie count. Mr. Kaminsky avoids restricting readers to a collection of recipes (although there are 14 stellar essentials at the book's closing) or stringent meal plans. Maximizing your FPC (flavors per calorie) is the linchpin, and Mr. Kaminsky has it down to a science.

In December, the ECB lent banks €489 billion ($648 billion) at a maturity of three years, the central bank's biggest commitment of funds to date. That action is credited by many economists and ECB officials, including Mr. Draghi, with averting a credit crunch.

After 10 seasons of futility and a reputation as one of MLB's worst franchises — on and off the field — the Rays made a stunning worst-to-first run that turned Tampa Bay into a crazed baseball town. The season was filled with big moments, topped by Dan Johnson's dramatic pinch-hit game-tying homer in a key September game at Fenway and Fernando Perez's daring dash in the 11th inning to win Game 2 and even the ALCS. But Baldelli's hit and Aybar's run was the most significant because of what it led to, a berth in World Series.

This was a no-pretense guy who, like other military veterans in politics, had lived through much worse than his opponents could ever throw at him. Rangel’s ordeal came in the retreat from North Korea, and he was liberated by surviving the experience.

When devout, sheltered, infertile Texas homemaker Linda (Rachael Harris) finds out her fundamentalist, no-sex-without-procreation husband had a stroke at the sperm bank he'd been secretly visiting for decades, well, that's the sort of thing that sends a woman out alone on a road trip. She tracks down the product of one of her husband's donations, Raymond (Matt O'Leary), a loser on the lam with his own self-interested reasons for going along with Linda. It beggars belief that these two would be around each other long enough to find a real human connection (the forces that do so are blatantly contrived), but credit should go to first-time writer-director Robbie Pickering for taking a premise that's basically the Christian version of "Transamerica" and deftly walking the line between comedy and serious disturbance.
The boy, a quiet slip of a 10-year-old, had been prescribed two antipsychotics, two mood stabilizers, one antidepressant, two attention deficit disorder medications and another medication to manage the side effects of the antipsychotics.

Penn's new program is directed by L. Scott Levin, an internationally known orthopedic and plastic surgeon who was recruited from Duke University 17 months ago.
Why is spit so full of information? Saliva contains proteins, enzymes, hormones and DNA. That's why the cholesterol spit-test won't be the only one you'll see in the next few years. One of the most exciting saliva tests in development is a reliable screening for the inflammation marker called C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP can indicate heart disease — or an impending heart attack — and tracking changing levels can let doctors and patients check on how well cardio treatments are working. That can speed recovery after a heart attack or other cardiac problems. And eventually, many important health risk factors — including stress; exposure to harmful chemicals in the air, water or food; a person's history of infectious disease; and of course oral health — may be measured this way.
PROBATION VIOLATION: On April 21, a 21-year-old resident of the 2400 block of Illinois Avenue, Granite City, was arrested at Cardinal Avenue and National Avenue on a charge of violating probation.
But numbers? They really seem to bore him. Ask him about the otherworldly statistics Aaron Rodgers has compiled for Packers this season and he responds with the same look he gives his receivers when passes bounce off their hands and into the waiting arms of a defensive back.

4.Boy, 9, fights off would-be kidnapper- An Ahwatukee boy was nearly kidnapped on his way to school but fought off the man with his skateboard, an official said.
Of note, as well, is that investors' demand for Treasury bonds didn't change much last week. If anything, it increased. Yields on 10- and 30-year bonds actually fell a bit Friday. That means that investors were willing to receive lower returns just to hold them.
On the Monday after the army came in, people discovered 20 bodies in front of a high school, he said. A few young men went to retrieve them and were shot and killed, he said. For three days no one dared approach the bodies, until the army gathered them and dumped them in one of the city's roundabouts.

"That just means I'm going to hear the case," Koblentz said.
At Lynn Crest School, a K-5 school in Woodbridge, a satisfying 100 percent of fourth graders were proficient in language arts, but principal Scott Osborne is looking for ways to raise the above proficient numbers, which were zero in 2008. "That was one of our main points of emphasis this year," Osborne said.
2. The Lakers hardly played much defense. Let's just preface the rest of this analysis by saying the game itself means absolutely nothing. The Lakers already knew they'd face the Denver Nuggets in the first round. Still, it would've been nice if the Lakers actually used this as a practice scrimmage to hone some defensive concepts since it's remained their primary weakness in the last month. Instead, the Lakers simply played the Kings as if they're NBA Jam. Yeah, Mike Brown isn't going to dissect this tape that featured all the Kings' starters cracking double digits and scoring 25 fastbreak points. But this game certainly doesn't help matters either.
Three short-handed goals by the Kings helps heal some of those wounds, of course.

Lauren Roemer, 18, of Brunswick has larger plans. She used to cook with her mother and also wanted to learn more.
The sourdough bread craze traces back to the Gold Rush era, and to Boudin. The bakery says it is San Francisco's oldest continuously running company, having started in 1849 on Dupont Street in North Beach (now Grant Avenue) and moving to its current digs after the 1906 earthquake, during which Louise Boudin salvaged the original mother dough in a bucket.
Life Sherpa: The burger was perfectly average. It was fresh and juicy, but it lacked that beefy, carnivorous taste of a really good burger. The bun was good, toasty and warm, also soft and fresh. The fries: This was the highlight of the meal. Cooked in peanut oil, they were crisp on the outside, soft and hot inside. The dipping sauces (99 cents each; we went with zesty horseradish) are a nice touch.
Bell, who signed a $27 million, three-year contract to join the Marlins in the offseason, had his fourth blown saves in seven chances.

By this point, I want to rip Joshua's lungs out and wrap them around his neck like a scarf.
A heart of palm is the white tube-shaped sort of asparagus-tasting thing that comes from the inner core of certain palm trees. It's most often used cold in salads. We're going to grill it, and it's going to kick ass. Serve it on the side like you would grilled asparagus.
"He (father) put his hands up and the others came back," Sinha said. "Then the first guy punched him on the side of the head."
Usually, when a game has so many different elements, some are less successful than others. But I was surprised by how nimbly "Starhawk" shifts among genres, from third-person shooter to tower defense to dogfighting.
Others with a shot include Take Charge Indy, Dullahan, Creative Cause, Daddy Nose Best, Went the Day Well, I'll Have Another and Done Talking who all won their final preps. Of these, the two that stand out are Dullahan and Done Talking, both for their late running style. And in the case of Done Talking, his 50:1 odds are curiously, tantalizingly high.

But Obama probably would explain his unlikely success in this unfair nation as the result of his being an exceptional and extraordinary individual. Which is why, I would assume in his thinking, we ordinary folk should turn our lives over to him to determine who should have what.
According to the report, the state launched this push last year, with 4.5 million video plays in the taxis. Commercials are also being shown in neighboring states.
Why: Since this superlative is all about offers, I’ll stick with Tate, who was a four-star prospect that also considered scholarships from Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Penn State, Virginia and Virginia Tech. Tate’s time at receiver was short-lived in College Park, as former Terps coach Ralph Friedgen switched the 6-foot-4, 220-pound player to safety before his freshman season began. Tate was an All-ACC pick at safety as a junior, but was switched to linebacker before his senior year by Maryland coach Randy Edsall. He had season-ending surgery on an undisclosed injury in October, and later received a medical redshirt. Tate will have a chance to live up to his four-star hype as a fifth-year senior this fall.

Film critic Stephen Whitty wonders where the movies for adults have gone. The year's biggest hits were: "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2," "Transformers: Dark of the Moon," "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 1," "The Hangover Part II," "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," "Fast Five," "Cars 2," "Thor," "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" and "Captain America: The First Avenger." Not one of them, he argues, is an original movie, and none of them are dramas.
The Red Wings averaged about two goals a game in March and April, discounting games played against opponents that were out of the playoff race. For some of that stretch the Wings didn't have key offensive players such as Pavel Datsyuk, Johan Franzen and Nicklas Lidstrom, but even after everyone came back, scoring was problematic.
Police said a 30-foot Pro-Line fishing vessel operated by a 39-year-old man crashed into the side of a 17-foot Bayliner speedboat occupied by the three victims.

Advocates who fight trafficking point out that the 40,000 figure is identical to the one used ahead of the World Cup in Germany four years ago. Researchers at the International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based intergovernmental agency, looked into the number following the 2006 event. Officials they interviewed said they saw no jump in measures related to sex trafficking, including police cases and calls to hotlines, says Sarah Louise Craggs, a project officer with IOM.

Dishes will draw discreetly from the bag of high-tech tricks he learned while cooking at Mugaritz, one of Spain's top avant-garde kitchens.

Too cute. But with that kind of money, her cup, or cups, would have runneth over with greenbacks. And that's a lot of money for 2011, let alone 1911, so my question would have been: "Where was she going with the cash?"

Popular, indeed. Here in Colorado, we are currently preparing to shower money on Hollywood producers — whom, as everyone knows, make ideal recipients of corporate welfare. After all, they come and go without really planting roots. And the local jobs they create are mostly temporary and depend upon politicians keeping the subsidy spigot perpetually running.

Skipper's used to go through 100 pounds of smoked mullet a week. In recent years, it's down to 25 or less. But the bony fish still holds a place of honor at Skipper's — employees call themselves Mullets, and their smoking deck is known as the Mullet Pen. So when asked for his favorite tchotchke on the walls at Skipper's, White points to a red mullet-shaped weather vane high above the coolers of free water. "An old girlfriend, when I first bought Skipper's, gave me this weather vane as a present," he said. "I don't know that it points to anything. But it's so unique."

Early forecasts estimate that the economy will have grown at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annual rate in the current April-June quarter. That's a relatively weak pace that wouldn't spur robust job growth. Still, it's above the 1.8 percent growth the government reported Thursday for the January-March period. The natural disasters haven't led economists to reduce their estimates for April-June quarter.

But to my thinking, the grand simplicity of the metaphor is a big part of "In Time"'s oddly retro sci-fi charm. Niccol is practicing the old-school craft of making a barn-broad alternate-reality that forces you to think about the way we all consensually agree to participate in systems -- even when those systems are hopelessly screwed up.

While Head said there is a lot to celebrate, the festivities for the 35th anniversary were a little low key. Head said they had a private party at the hospital for past and present staff and for volunteers. A marked difference from public ceremony held for the 20th anniversary in 1977. Shadwick said her family was invited to the event, with her daughter, who is now a stay-at-home mom in St. Louis, being a featured guest.

For a number of female surrealists, Mexico — a country of rugged natural beauty and epic history, steeped in indigenous imagery and myths — seemed a land of wonders and a creative playground for Western bohemians estranged from their native cultures. André Breton, the French poet, pamphleteer and surrealist godfather, idealized the earthquake-sculpted nation as a land of "convulsive beauty" — the surrealist country par excellence.
He said he'd do everything in his power to keep their names private, including possibly risking a contempt ruling by keeping them secret if the judge orders him or Special Prosecutor Angela Corey to release them.

I think it's important to remember that, like all of Mike Daisey's works, the Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs is multifaceted and intimate: it concerns itself with the personality of Jobs, and with the nature of obsession, as well as with Daisey's own journey to Shenzhen to unpiece the history of the Apple devices he loves so dearly; it is a work which is more than a recitation of abuses, it is a complex attempt to bring us to a different way of understanding the coveted technology which has become an integral part of our daily life. Although Daisey has misrepresented how he came to know some of the information, the experience of workers in China involved in manufacturing devices for American consumers has been documented.

According to NCAA bylaws, a player has until “the end of the day before the first day of the spring National Letter of Intent signing period.’’ That would be April 10, about two months from now.

Usually, at the warehouse these are just the tiniest “vignettes”: the nicks and scratches on a dining room table that suggest that this was no showpiece for formal occasions — people actually sat at this table, ate, talked, fought, forgot to use coasters.

Overseas, ticket sales for "The Hunger Games" were healthy but not as spectacular as in the United States.

Frank Sterle's Slovenian Country House, 1401 East 55th St., Cleveland, 216-881-4181: Who says Cleveland's polka past is long gone? This near East Side institution serves up not only polka nights but also a menu you'd imagine Frankie Yankovic digging into in the 1970s. You know, Eastern European staples like wienerschnitzel. The Alpine lodge-style dining hall feels like it's straight out of yesteryear, when Eastern Euros came to the city in waves. And they came here, to eat well.
A. You can petition for your husband now. The law does not limit the number of spouses you can petition for permanent residence. However, since this is the second time you are sponsoring a husband, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services examiner may think that you are marrying men just to help them get green cards. So, make an extra effort to show that your marriage is bona fide or "real." Or, in the words of the USCIS, that yours is not a "sham" marriage. Depending on how long you were married to your first husband, an examiner may also ask for proof that your first marriage was bona fide. Though seven years is a long time, do your best to provide it. Even without proof that your first marriage was not a sham, I doubt the agency can deny your petition just because you previously petitioned for a husband. Unless of course, the USCIS has evidence that your first marriage was a sham, After seven years, it would be unreasonable for the USCIS to require you to provide lots of evidence about your past marriage.

The Bears eventually caught on - Rodgers was 9-of-19 for 96 yards and two interceptions after that, but the damage was done.

White: Without oak, Chardonnay can telegraph all the pretty tree-fruit flavors of fall. Seeing as we'll soon be awash in oysters and fresh Dungeness, I wanted a mineral edge too. (Plus, the prospect of an oaky white to match turkey seems like a turbo booster for your tryptophan-induced haze.) The 2010 vintage once again brought Chablis its stony edge, and I went with the 2010 Patrick Piuze Petit Chablis ($20, 12.5%, Aliane Wines) from an ascendant name in the region. Its exoticism - it smells a bit like a fruit market in Bangkok - rounds out classic gunflint freshness.

At the senior colleges overall, numbers of black students have remained flat while the numbers of other ethnic groups have grown.

What stops people from buying used?

Mr. Dundee also loved to tell the story of the night he was in the corner for a little-known heavyweight named Johnny Holman. Remembering that Holman's dream was to buy a house, Mr. Dundee tried to motivate Holman when he said, "This guy's taking away your house from you. He's taking away those shutters from you. He's taking away that television set from you." Holman would come back to win - and get that house.

2. Trigger finger: If your idea of happiness is a warm gun, then you should probably take aim at Machine Guns Vegas, a new, off-the-Strip attraction for those who like to go ballistic. The clublike venue features hostesses who help you pick out your weapon from an iPad menu (perhaps an M4 carbine, Uzi or AK-47); there also are female "range masters" who are responsible for guest safety and personal instruction. There are 10 shooting lanes, including two completely private lanes with a separate entrance for VIPs. Packages range from about $100 to $800, depending on the firearm and number of rounds. Each package includes your targets and a T-shirt as mementos. There's also complimentary transportation from the Strip. Oh, in case you were wondering: No alcohol is served.

Though most tourists have probably never heard of many of these towns before - Huasca de Ocampo? Jerez de Garcia Salinas? Tlalpujahua (not to be confused with Tapijulapa)? - obscurity is not a requirement. Ex-pat magnet San Miguel de Allende made the cut in 2002 but has since been ousted. San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas was a Gringo Trail stalwart. Patzcuaro in Michoacán, while somnolent most of the year, has been the place to go for Day of the Dead for years now.

Greg Cote, Miami Herald: "New Dolphins offensive coordinator Mike Sherman and defensive chief Kevin Coyle are optimistic and like what they see of the team's direction. That's fantastic. I will pay, from my own pocket, the first newly hired coach in any sport who publicly expresses pessimism. I want to see the headline, 'Sherman, Coyle doubt team's direction.' Or, 'Dolphins' new coordinators not hopeful.' By the way, new coach Joe Philbin has 21 assistant coaches on his staff. Lot of specialists there. I think the backup long snapper has his own coach."

But Johnson, bless him, is in there swinging, giving it his best while, among other things, flicking his pecs while others bounce berries off them -- yes -- in a nearly non-stop plea for the audience to like him. And the effort pays off, sort of, in that Johnson again comes off as a thoroughly decent fellow (though was it really necessary for him to sing?). Plus, the look of the film is impressive, as are the effects. Overall, however, it's a big, loud, 3-D-drenched jumble.
In an investigation about a separate incident, reporter Jeff Burnside of WTVJ lost his job because of a March 19 report on the dispatcher's call that similarly edited out the dispatcher's question that prompted Zimmerman's characterization of Martin as black, said Matt Glassman, spokesman for the NBC-owned station.

Brown, 21, is serving five years of probation after pleading guilty to felony assault for the attack on Rihanna in the early morning hours before the 2009 Grammys. "Graffiti," the album he released 10 months after the attack, was a commercial disappointment. But his latest release, "F.A.M.E.

We bet you've heard the news linking high LDL cholesterol and saturated fat intake (greasy cheeseburgers and premium ice cream) to low sperm counts -- while good-fat foods like fish and walnuts are associated with a bigger, better baby-making squad. Our favorite headline (kudos to Maine's Bangor Daily News!) says it all: Sperm goes limp with fatty foods, while fish perks them up. But don't stop there. If you're a man concerned about fertility (or a spouse hoping for a baby soon), we have a do-it-yourself male fertility improvement plan.

It is as important that religion not be forced upon the people as it is that the people not enforce their will upon religion. It is generally accepted that in this country most employers provide insurance for their employees.

Though estimates vary, outside experts say the North has enough plutonium for about four to eight "simple" bombs, more if it can employ uranium. But, so far, North Korea's attempts to demonstrate it has mastered the technology — with tests in 2006 and 2009 — have not been entirely successful.

The album is the first release on her own label, Red Wing Records. It's largely run by trusted associates so Raitt can focus on being a musician, "but ultimately," she said, "I'm saying yes or no to everything.

If somebody's not working out, you can change it, which you can't always do on a label."
What do all the numbers mean for fishermen and boaters? In all likelihood, an early fishing season on area rivers that could grow increasingly difficult. Although wading the rivers is easier, low flows lead to increased water temperatures, lethargic fish and mossy riverbeds.

Michigan's schools-of-choice program enables parents to enroll their children in a school operated by a neighboring district. School boards ultimately decide whether they are going to enroll nonresident students, but if they do, they must follow certain rules, since they receive state aid on behalf of each student. State law explicitly forbids districts that accept nonresident students to refuse enrollment based on "intellectual, academic, artistic or other ability."

"Why Nations Fail" is a splendid piece of scholarship and a showcase of economic rigor. But even so, it captures only part of the story.

The next 10 minutes of the show will be spent with people debating whether it will be Christina or Mike going home tonight. It goes back and forth all over the place, and it’s not like the editors are going to give it away. Like I said before, I think Kim is making her move too soon and is risking alienating jury votes, even if this works for her in the short term. I don’t see Jay or Troyzan forgiving her when the lies come out. In talking to the men, it seems like Kim is seeing my point, but I don’t trust the "Survivor" editors, so I’m not calling anything.
