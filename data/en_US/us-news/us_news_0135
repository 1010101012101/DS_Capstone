Unfortunately, in the past few decades, the house has withered into a state of perilous disrepair. Neutra's home was given to Cal Poly Pomona University by his widow upon her death in 1990, and now feels more like something out of a crumbling section of Havana than the crown jewel of an American city. The house you will find, with empty fountains, broken windows and cracking veneers, is a house the way Miss Havisham is a lady: once lovely and delicate, always compelling, never too late to rescue. So come soon.

Mostly, however, mothers and grandmothers shared memories of child rearing, and laughter found its voice.

4) Querétaro (2.02): Also among Mexico's smaller states, Querétaro is one of the most geographically varied, ranging from desert to tropical rainforest. The capital, Santiago de Querétaro, was designated the "third city of New Spain" in 1531 and is a trove for history buffs. It is best-known, however, for its role in ending Spanish rule. Overshadowing such momentous events as Maximilian's execution or the signing of the Treaty of Hidalgo and Mexican Constitution, its greatest source of pride is being the place where the fathers of independence plotted to overthrow the Spanish. Ecotourism is the mainstay of the Sierra Gorda biological reserve. The state also claims three of Mexico's major wineries and maintains a Cheese and Wine Museum. San Sebastián Bernal, whose Peña de Bernal is the third-largest rock in the world, is one of Mexico's Magic Pueblos.

What got worse after Jay left the lineup with his shoulder sprain was the offense. Other than a brief appearance as a pinch runner, Jay missed the entirety of the six-game road trip during which the team struggled to score. Most of the credit went to the opponent's starting pitchers, especially Cubs righties Matt Garza and Jeff Samardzija, who handcuffed the Cardinals in consecutive games at Wrigley Field this past week. But a contributing factor was absences.

If Edwards were being prosecuted for shameful dereliction of duty as a husband and father, he'd deserve 30 years of hard labor.

During our investigation and the trial, my mother has repeatedly asked me, "When is this about Rusty?" Unfortunately, I have been forced to explain to her this trial was really not about him.

There have been so many lies told to this court about Rusty, even to the extent of the defense shamefully equating my brother's life with that of this killer. So let's set the record straight:

Considering that weddings are often your one chance to bring all the important people in your life together, it's unfortunate that the big event is often a dizzying, stressful blur with little time to spend with anyone.

There are comfortable accommodations for every budget and taste. Delicious food and drinks are abundant and easy on your wallet.

I find the latest concern by oil companies over the plummeting price of crude rather amusing. They would have consumers believe that unless oil rebounds immediately to a profitability point of $75 a barrel the industry will suffer, exploration will cease, and supplies will be thin once demand picks up. I'm all for companies making money. But since September of 2007 crude prices have averaged just about $106 a barrel. Since oil began to sag on the world markets in October the running average since September 2007 is still $99 a barrel. And even if prices were to continue at a level of $45 a barrel for the next 12 months, the average would still be at the magic price of $75 a barrel. This happens to be a down cycle for oil. But it's hardly the calamity that oil companies would have us believe. I see no legitimate business reason why there should be any concern until the average price dips below $75 a barrel. By my calculations that will be at least a year away under the worst of circumstances. Until then I would hope that oil companies will do what all companies should do. Dip into profits earned during the good times and continue to do business. The price will rebound in time. But I doubt that Americans will be too happy if exploration and investment cease while oil companies sit on those huge profits thereby causing another shortage and an inflated return to $140 oil.
Leaving aside whether Netflix was smart to split itself in two or raise its rates (or grovel before customers), I thought the more devastating news for the future of Netflix came on Sept. 1.

Tuesday's hearing was the fourth of five being held this month.
The Gaming Commission's main argument against the President is that it's not doing enough to reverse its revenue declines. The commission cites a provision in state gaming code that allows it to discipline casinos for behavior that is "injurious" to the state.

"Damages" (10 p.m. Wednesday, July 13, DirectTV's Audience Network): Dropped by FX, the riveting legal mystery drama moves to DirecTV for its fourth season.

* It's an organization that has a plan, and knows how to establish a core nucleus of veterans that are supplemented by an improved and increasingly productive farm system. This is an organization that's been winning consistently since Bill DeWitt took over as owner/chairman in 1996. It's an organization that has the fourth-highest win total in the majors since '96, and more postseason wins than any franchise except the NY Yankees. It's an organization that made the playoffs twice (1996, 2000) before Pujols arrived as a rookie in 2001, and it's an organization that seemingly has the pieces to make it to postseason again, in the first year without Pujols.

For the Yankees, Posada’s struggles had become untenable. In 90 games, mostly as the DH, Posada hit just .230 with nine home runs. Of the 11 players in the American League with at least 300 plate appearances as a designated hitter, the 39-year-old Posada ranks ahead of only the White Sox’s Adam Dunn when measured by weighted on-base percentage, which attempts to measure a player’s total offensive value.
After such a massive introduction, Grannis, who plays Baltimore Soundstage on Friday, signed with Interscope Records, essentially putting use for her social science degree on hold. Judging from her videos, Grannis seems plucked out of "New Girl," a possible new best friend or twee-rival for Zooey Deschanel's protagonist. Your ability to like Grannis will depend on your appreciation/tolerance for cutesy, Cotton-of-our-Lives-type jams, the kind that Taylor Swift may deem too lightweight for album cuts. But there's genuine charm to her songs — sticky hooks, a sweet innocence many of us should be envious of — even if they feel slight at times. Don't be surprised if the songs eventually catch up to the potential.
The revival comes with a curiosity. Ben Stiller's mother, Anne Meara, appeared in the play when it opened 40 years ago Off-Broadway.

This revival marks Stiller's first Broadway appearance since that debut.

Merely being associated with a disapproved entity could bring the axe. RecycleForce is such a case.

Pakistanis are in some ways partners in the effort. U.S. conventional forces are banned from the tribal areas, but Pakistan tacitly acquiesces to Washington's reliance on drones to strike militant camps and hide-outs.

If the intelligence is faulty, or if civilians are near militant targets, civilian casualties are almost inevitable.

Annie puts in the extra work, on or off the ice, that's needed for an elite athlete to excel."

Dear Dis: I think this must have been a jolt to your system, and there is definitely something wrong. A child that young has no way of knowing anything about sex, even if she'd seen some porn on TV. (If she's seen a lot of porn, that could be a problem.) I know this may sound almost unbelievable, but there's a good chance that some male member of the child's family is molesting her. This is not to say that young children, even babies, don't touch themselves, but to be that sexualized at her age means someone is having at her. If you don't feel comfortable bringing this up with her mother (which admittedly would be difficult, even if you were close friends), I would call the family services agency in your town and just report what you saw. You will have done as much as possible to advocate for this child. — Margo, regretfully
Ultimately, the team manipulates Travis into implicating himself and others, and he's arrested, and justice is done.
How strange, then, that "Farther Away" contains more to like than to love. There's something to be said for a push toward clarity and consistency. In "How to Be Alone," his previous collection of nonfiction, Franzen described rereading the Harper's essay - "an essay, evidently written by me, that began with a five-thousand-word complaint of such painful stridency and tenuous logic that even I couldn't quite follow it."
A May 14 hearing is set before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an ongoing legal battle between the Forest Service and the John Muir Project over salvage logging in woodpecker habitat where 250 homes burned in the 2007 Angora fire at South Lake Tahoe, Calif.

Why might a robust dorsolateral prefrontal cortex be better than one hobbled by chronic pain? Because this area plays a key role in mood, social judgment, short-term memory and higher-order thinking, and any or all might suffer with the loss of cell density in the region.
Love can come out of the microwave, too.
Major stock indexes stand at their highest levels in more than a month but the gains have come in light trading volume. That indicates many investors are staying out of the market as they await more evidence about the economy.

There are two other locations, at 3110 N. Shadeland Ave. and 1269 W. Oliver St. But it's the Northwestside location, situated amid ethnic eateries near Lafayette Square, that I found so appealing during a recent visit. At 33,000 square feet, the store is larger than its other locations.
"We believe the electrification of vehicles will continue as the battery costs come down and there's a move to generate clean energy," Mulally said.
It's easy to keep a boat mussel-free. The first rule is don't go to a lake in Southern California that has mussels. Since their discovery in Lake Mead in 2007, invasive mussels have spread to 16 lakes and rivers in the Colorado River watershed, and a boat from that area spread the zebra mussel to San Justo Reservoir near Hollister. San Justo was closed to all boating overnight, and an alert went out to all boaters and recreation lakes across the state.

Along the way Lewis has picked up two IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) awards as Female Vocalist of the Year and a Grammy for her contribution to "True Life Blues: A Tribute to Bill Monroe," produced by Right Hands bassist Phillips. And in addition to singing like a bird, playing bass, guitar and world-class fiddle and paving the way for such high-profile pop-tinged "new acoustic" bluegrass-folk acts as Alison Krauss and Nickel Creek, Lewis has written dozens of gorgeous memorable songs that tap traditional idioms while expressing contemporary sentiments and speaking to the moment ("Love Chooses You," "Texas Bluebonnets," "The Hills of My Home," "The Maple's Lament," "The Oak and the Laurel," among them).

Last month, Bourne's world caved in. On Jan. 4, he was arrested, along with another Mammoth Lakes man, on suspicion of sexual crimes involving a teenage girl. He quit the school board. Mammoth Hospital, where he recently served as chief of staff and where his brother is an anesthesiologist, ended his contract. Twenty days after his arrest on charges of "illegal communication with a minor to facilitate sexual activity," Bourne, 46, drove to an isolated spot outside of town and ended his life. He was tracked down with the aid of a GPS device in an ankle bracelet he wore as a condition of his $750,000 bail.
Holmgren: "I would think that could be a difficult situation except if it is ever going to work, it will work if that happens, because Colt McCoy is a special young man. I have always said that. Of course he wants to play, they all want to play. Again, nothing has been done yet, we don't know how it is going to sort itself out. But, if that were to be the case, at some point, I think we have the best chance of making that work because of who the people are, who the players are. It is never easy, everyone wants to play. But, you only have one ball and only one guy can play at a time."
So Taylor spends a lot of time on Skype and conference calls with colleagues from the home office. She travels two or three times a month to other states and occasionally back to Boston. In some ways, this arrangement is more flexible, but Taylor said she finds it forces her to be more efficient.

For weeks after the concert I was unable to shake off the guilt of my epiphany. I also could not help being curious as to how many others might have a similar attitude. Then I began wondering how people without any weight issues perceive those they deem as not simply chubby or even heavy but much too fat.
And this is what the future of reality television hinges on  its ability to find real people that other real people will want to watch.
Faith's measure was spurred by the $235,823 buyout approved by York and the City Council in October for Karen McDermott, St. Charles' finance director for about 18 years. Using city money "to buy an employee's silence is not a good use of taxpayers' dollars," Faith said.

And there was the price: 10 percent off the weekly 1,700-euro rate in August, a time when pretty much all of France is on vacation.
Everything we do makes a difference, though, and even a small amount of exercise is no exception. A recent study shows that regular physical activity has important benefits for our blood sugar levels, whether we’re in good physical condition to begin with or currently living a sedentary lifestyle. With heart disease, Type-2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses on the rise for both women and men, it is becoming clear that this is the kind of information that deserves to get us off of the couch.
As sensuous as her gyrations are, her repeated demands for Iokanaan's head are delivered in a monotonous series of shouts -- less like a canny seductress than a child throwing a tantrum.

Don't plan on ever retiring. You'll have to work until you're dead, like we are. We're retired, but both of us are working just to keep up. That's why it's insane to ever vote for any tax increase. These schools get plenty of money; they just need to stop the waste and use the money they have efficiently. Please never vote for a tax increase for anything. You're crazy.
It also has a surprisingly upbeat feel, given the darkness of the lyrics. "He's imitating your guys on Wall Street the only way he knows how," Springsteen has said of the song's narrator.
Now that the state is sending more prisoners to the counties, offenders that would have been on parole now will possibly be on probation. Small says GPS monitoring makes Orange County better prepared to handle the highest risk offenders.
Cerf was not at Wednesday's meeting, but he was appointed assistant commissioner, which an Education Department spokesman said was necessary before he could be appointed acting commissioner. In coming weeks, Cerf is expected to be appointed acting commissioner, prior to confirmation by the Senate.

He replied that Julian "was outside" and there was nothing to worry about, she said. The boy was found three days later a couple miles from Cathey's home, shot to death in Jason Hudson's stolen SUV.
Going forward into the new year, look for more and more travel suppliers -- especially airlines, but not exclusively airlines -- to start adding fees for online purchase or fees for paying with a credit or debit card. Again, they'll claim they give you no-fee options, but those supposed options will all be more cumbersome and expensive than buying online with a credit card.
Caliche captures fourth consecutive 1A title
Four years ago, Obama became the first Democrat to carry North Carolina since Jimmy Carter in 1976. He did it by exploiting voter anger at President George W. Bush and assembling a diverse coalition of supporters, including huge numbers of minorities who had never been politically organized and young voters. State law allowed people to register to vote on Election Day, which also meant the large student vote could be tapped.
Though he is an unmistakable physical presence, Abdul's identity becomes less clear. He keeps people at a remove, as his multiple identities and erasures form an indelible barrier. His growing reputation and new clique put pressure on that cloudy center, and he confronts fears about his parentage, figuring out who his father must be. It's all too much for him.
The more Heslin heard, the angrier he got. He visited the Veterans Administration and asked for ways he could help. Then, he took action and founded Serene Haven, a Home for the Brave.

Lisa Malanij offered an intriguing unisex collection of post-apocalyptic, not-so-basic basics that used a recurring motif of circles and squares. Futuristic and punk, the KSU grad's collection was distinctive but also very wearable; its pieces could easily be adapted to any level of conservatism a wearer might desire. Better yet, her pieces are done in humble, affordable fabrics; all these factors should make this young designer attractive to retailers and consumers alike.
"The Tierra agreement to begin remediation resulted solely from our filing of a lawsuit," Moore said of the 2005 action that was endorsed by former DEP Commissioner Lisa Jackson. Jackson, now head of the EPA, is precluded from discussing the New Jersey environmental or legal matters "as required by federal ethics rules," said Rozanne Smith, the EPA's press director.
McIlroy twice has reached No. 1 in the world this spring, only for Luke Donald to wrest it away from him last week in New Orleans. It's a battle that could go on during the summer, with perhaps Lee Westwood rejoining the fray. McIlroy or Westwood could go to No. 1 with a win this week. Donald is not playing.

The result? A disappointment. The new version offers no new moviegoing thrills, and, to my eyes, is actually a less enjoyable visual experience.
2. The Truman Show (1998) Christof: Earning a supporting-actor nomination, Harris plays the meglomaniacal television producer who truly can't see why keeping a young child a prisoner on a TV show is a bad thing.

Written by Randy Blair and Tim Drucker, the duo behind “Perez Hilton Saves the Universe,” the show is a lot of fun, with a perky pop/rock score by Blair (lyrics) and Matthew roi Berger (music). Kelly Devine’s energetic choreography milks maximum comic mileage from the frantic gyrations of generously proportioned bodies. At this rate, they may well exercise themselves out of a job.

The capital-projects bill, which still awaits action, contains $496 million in bricks-and-mortar projects such as flood mitigation and bridge repairs, but not local projects members had tried to insert. For instance, the House version has no money for convention centers, the Southwest rail corridor, a face-lift for Nicollet Mall or a new ballpark for the St. Paul Saints. It scaled back the House's original plan to borrow more than $200 million to repair the crumbling State Capitol; the new figure is $44 million.

You don't often hear Republicans praising President Barack Obama, but Zeidman said that with MavPAC, he and Bush are looking to emulate Democrats' engagement of younger voters. "Looking at the 2008 election, the one thing the president did very well was engaging the young generation. ... I think that's something, as a party, we really need to do, and that's what George and I are trying to help steer MavPAC towards - getting people involved and educating them on really, why should they care?" he said.

Day 1 was easy for Schiano. He is a natural for moments like this. Tampa went 4-12 last season, becoming an undisciplined mess on the field (losing their final 10 games) and off it.

In the living room, for example, the solid bulk of a decidedly modern coffee table blends surprisingly well with the curves of a rustic antique side board nearby. Just across from the coffee table, two antique wooden armchairs flank a blue marble fireplace with a white mantle. The niche above the fireplace bears a decorative wood cutout design. This simple circle design is played up in the bright blue-and-white pattern of the reupholstered chairs, which are family relics.

The big prize for Oregon from the count would be adding a House seat, said both Lightfoot and Deni Luna, spokeswoman for the Census Bureau's regional office in Bothell, Wash.

5) Use the dining room everyday: Tuck clutter into natural baskets in the dining room in an open console, and use repetition for a great springtime appeal. All accessories can be functional in this space--either to display food, garden cuttings, or napkins and silverware. 6) Consider an "all-white" bed transformation: One of the simplest changes that make a bedroom fresh immediately is all white bed linens, including the duvet cover. White mixes with any color--even cream or flax-toned linen. Change the wall color to a fresh water color or green inspired by nature, and the mood will change dramatically. Contrasting dark furniture is especially appealing with this approach, and adds visual interest. Also, be sure to snap a photo when you are done to make sure you have removed any excess clutter on the night stands.

And then in the second half, in the 65th minute, a young player named Alan Gordon headed the ball into Milwaukee's net. Diving header man looked smug. I was trying to write this development down in my notebook when all of a sudden I went blind. A thick, lung-searing cloud of smoke had enveloped the section. I looked down and, amid the dancing feet, spotted a smoke bomb fizzing in a tin pail filled with sand. At least they are practicing responsible hooliganism, I thought. Then I heard the fire alarm go off.

India's self-image can ill-afford another blow so soon after the chaos surrounding New Delhi's preparations for the Commonwealth Games, which begin Sunday. Filthy athletes' accommodation, a lack of readiness at venues, and a construction accident have been widely criticized by delegates from Commonwealth member countries and viewed by many Indians as a setback to the nation's efforts to project its modernity. If the country remains calm in the wake of the verdict, it will help counter the negative impression of the country's progress created by the Games mess.

Way back in the last millenium, people always knew that public schools started the day after Labor Day. Why begin classes that Tuesday?

The theme of the evening was wheeling and dealing. Within the first hour of the first round, eight picks among the first 15 selections traded hands. The Rams had started the trade frenzy last month, trading the No. 2 overall pick for a boatload of picks from Washington, then Thursday traded again with Dallas. What Snead has done with his wheeling and dealing is set things up for the Rams to get four or five potential starters through two nights of the draft. Tonight, they will have the 33rd, 39th, 45th and 65th picks in the second and third rounds.
