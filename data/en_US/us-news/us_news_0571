We were never one of those families that wore Harry Potter outfits, memorized spells and waited on the sidewalk to buy the books at midnight. But my daughters grew up with Harry, and I did, too, in a way, between the reading aloud and the moviegoing, and sometimes I was embarrassed by how much I loved it.

Complications — expected and unexpected — ensue. Mark Duplass, Emily Blunt and Rosemarie DeWitt give lovely, bemused and wounded performances. (June/July, R)
The problems, typical of this stretch, occurred early. Guthrie allowed a double to Will Venable, the game's second batter.

As little respect as I have for the people at Heartland and their secret financial backers, whose irresponsible work is helping to assure a grim future for our children, I suspect they're not brain-dead enough to equate Nobel prize winner Al Gore with Osama bin Laden. Under the theory that any publicity is good publicity, they have mounted an ad campaign so calculated to outrage that it will attract nationwide media coverage, thus magnifying a relatively meager ad budget into a national campaign. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is one group that has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, but I'm not sure it has done much to aid PETA's cause.

Hollander said the Government Center, which opened to acclaim in the mid-1970s as something of an architectural gem, is now feeling its age, with features and mechanics starting to fail.

Maybe the national college player of the year will be Kentucky freshman John Wall, who is a one-and-done transient as surely as Texas' Kevin Durant was when he won in 2007.

If it was his job to carry a lot of money, maybe the state police superintendent would have given him a concealed carry permit that would have saved his life.

"Chicago shaped Playboy in ways I didn't realize at the time," Hefner wrote in last Sunday's Tribune. "New York City seemed a world away from the rest of America, sophisticated and socially advanced, detached from the remainder of the country. Chicago stood as the most significant representation of true, postwar America...

Interested in more than work and domestic security, longing for sexual adventure and enjoying the postwar financial boom, these men looked to spurn the restrictions of puritanical convention in favor of life as a single, city-bred male with a bachelor apartment and a proper martini. I counted myself among them."

Early reviews so far have been better than for the first "Titans" film, a key ingredient — but not as important as fanboy word of mouth — if the sequel is to have staying power.

Completely different in form, but likewise indebted to the Bauhaus, are geometric vessels glazed in flat, bright, primary and secondary hues. Their compositions recall early 20th century Russian Constructivist paintings by El Lissitzky and Dutch De Stijl works by Piet Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Like the Bauhaus, Constructivism and De Stijl valued pure abstraction, dynamic asymmetry and simplified shapes and colors. Price's exquisitely made cups brought down to earth the grand Utopian aspirations of those early 20th century movements.

Vazquez leaned in and tickled Samantha's chin as Karla held her. The couple greeted each other with a quick embrace and a peck, as if Karla had just returned from the store, not a weeks-long separation. Karla said the two want to keep their emotions in check so that Samantha doesn't sense anything unusual. They hope this is resolved in March and that the baby won't remember being separated from her father.

Candidate Patrice Brown resigned in March from an administrative-support job at the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office. In June, she told The Plain Dealer that she was running two home-based businesses, a for-profit and a nonprofit, to certify people for green jobs and place them. At the time, she said she had no clients or employees.
That guilt, it should be noted, came with a big price tag: at nearly $600 million, the new campus is the most expensive that LAUSD has built. In the end, the district's decision to commission elaborate replicas of the hotel's best-known spaces added to the cost of the project without managing to save very much actual architecture. That's a pretty good definition of the worst of both worlds.
In 2008, August Busch IV was given a lucrative consulting deal after Anheuser-Busch was sold to Belgian brewer InBev. The deal had aspirations to go beyond simple consulting. The new company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, indicated the contract would make Busch its public ambassador. That never happened.

Of course, the NCAA insists that it doesn't orchestrate first-round games with compelling subplots that could generate television ratings and, more important, ticket sales. But the Titans are probably looking at a 14th or 15th seed and the current bracket projections have the Spartans at No. 2 and the Wolverines at No. 3, making such a matchup possible.

Congress apparently -- thank heavens -- has come to its senses about keeping student loan rates at the current rate of 3.4%, rather than letting them revert to 6.8% on July 1. That's assuming the Senate and House can agree how to "pay" for the lower rate. The House may vote as early as today.

Best lesser-known baseball shrine: Hoboken, N.J. The antithesis of Cooperstown. It was here, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, that historians believe the first organized game of baseball was played June 19, 1846. The game at Elysian Fields was umpired by Alexander Joy Cartwright, using his rules that are still the basis of the game. The New York Base Ball Club, also called The New York Nine, crushed the Knickerbockers, 23-1. Since the Cooperstown legend held sway until the latter half of the 20th century, Hoboken never reaped much benefit from its key role in the history of the game. Elysian Fields is long gone, with only a marker at 11th and Washington streets memorializing the site. The city, best known as the hometown of Frank Sinatra, has undergone a renaissance in recent years. There's a W Hotel in town. And it's just across the Hudson River from Manhattan.

No question, this move makes it less likely that the McCormick site or the former News American site will be redeveloped soon. And the move out of Constellation's current headquarters will only add to a relatively high vacancy rate for downtown office space. But that would have been the case regardless of where Exelon went. Instead of arguing about whether an existing business moves a mile to the east or west, downtown boosters need to focus on making the entire area more attractive to new employers.

But a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday underscores why the vision remains a challenge. Cancer researchers in England showed that individual kidney tumors and their metastases had different mutations in different locations — and that those mutations, in turn, affect the biology of those tumors in varying ways in different locations.

Bay City sued back, threatening to not allow beach access on the driveway, which adjoined its waterfront land. Bay City Partners said at the time they were willing to donate the beach access.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt took it upon himself in 1944 to add to the constitutional freedoms of speech and religion with his invented "freedom from want" and "freedom from fear," we as a nation took a sharp left turn. We have been veering down that descending leftward path ever since. Obamacare is but the latest acceleration, albeit perhaps the greatest boon yet to the Big Government state. It stands to do more than mandatory public school attendance, Medicare or Social Security have done to conform all people to the government's will.

Their extra-base power. The Cards lead the league in homers, slugging percentage, and isolated power despite having lost a player (Pujols) with the fourth-best all-time career slugging percentage. They have six everyday players with slugging percentages above .500, seven if you count Matt Carpenter. To put that into context, the MV3 lineup of 2004 (which led the NL in scoring by a wide margin) only had four regulars who slugged above .500 ---- and that was in an era when overall scoring was higher than it is today. The Cards are on pace to bash 236 homers, or 22 more than the MV3 team amassed. Unless I'm mistaken, that would be the highest one-year total in franchise history.

As for the suggestion that BackBid could turn the hotel industry hypercompetitive, I have only one thing to say to that: Now hotels know how it must have felt when Priceline burst onto the scene and consumers had to guess the winning rate when they made a name your own price bid. Many guests complained to me afterward, believing that they had overpaid. Hotels didn't care. Now they're getting their comeuppance, some might argue.
Once you asked Utell for help, it should have punted this back to your agent or your hotel to sort the problem out. Again, it's unclear why that didn't happen, and why you were left to negotiate directly with the hotel. I think the time to have done that was when your husband was standing at the check-in desk, without a room. That's when issues like payment need to get sorted out - not weeks after you've returned home.

Have the scheduled war games simply been postponed, or are they actually under way after months of planning, under the name of Operation Odyssey Dawn? Were opposition forces in Libya informed by the US, the UK or France about the existence of Southern Mistral/Southern Storm, which may have encouraged them to actions leading to greater repression and a humanitarian crisis? In short was this war against Gaddafi’s Libya planned or a spontaneous response to the great suffering which Gaddafi was visiting upon his opposition?

“I think he gets the power of not only the work but of the man -- his intensity and passion,” Benzali says of Logan. “Rothko was a complex man, and both he and his work were controversial. He was demanding, in a way -- he wanted people to be as serious in looking at his work as he was in making it.

No need to bother with that revival of "King Lear" arriving in April at BAM. Why sit through the entirety of Shakespeare's classic when you can get pretty much the same story in less than 75 minutes?

"As you play, watch and come to understand the rhythms of the game, you get a better feel. I didn't have that as a young guy," Berkman said. "There is positioning and nuance.

3. Vince Carter for Alonzo Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams, December 17,
Exciting young rap acts such as Odd Future, Lil B and Chiddy Bang have not built their reputations through commercial airplay. They’ve taken their music directly to the listeners through Twitter, blogs and Myspace accounts. These emcees aren’t necessarily better than those who now occupy the mainstream; in many cases, they’re nowhere near as good. But they’ve all got something that mainstream hip-hop used to thrive on: fresh approaches.

His mere presence caused a man to dial 911 and report him. Without action, Trayvon was hunted and murdered in the street. Without reason, his murderer is free to patrol the streets in search of other suspicious, young children. Young children just like my son. Young children that share the same innocence, character and physical form as Trayvon Martin who was a handsome teenager, a student, an athlete, and someone's child. There is no justice for what was done to Trayvon, and there can be no real peace in a society that supports the murder of innocent children. We, as Americans, can only support any and all efforts to incarcerate this pathetic man who was afraid of a little boy with a bag of candy in his hand and hope that our actions are enough to protect our children; all of our children.

Hines, who had inserted an IV line into Reagan's right arm when he arrived, smiled. She was pretty sure she knew what he was really asking: Am I going to be OK, or am I going to die?

Beaujolais: Works for exactly the same reason. Bright fruit zings up the long march of the Thanksgiving meal. Now, that could be Beaujolais - or better yet, one of the few homegrown versions of Gamay Noir. But it could be any light, low-tannin red wine, from a bright Barbera to Sicilian Frappato.
Halliburton also reported a $300-million charge for “probable losses” related to the 2010 explosion at the Macondo well on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which killed 11 workers in the Gulf of Mexico and resulted in the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.

Smith’s contributions go far beyond goals and assists. There is a palpable energy she brings to the field that is noticeable in the Hilltoppers play. With her at less than 100 percent last season they were upset in the Archdiocesan playoffs. This year, Smith shined in the playoffs. She scored the eventual game-winning goals in the Archdiocesan semifinals and final, where Smith also dished out two assists. Her creativity and speed with the ball at her feet left defenders guessing what she would do next. She was also never afraid to run down a ball on defense and win it back.

Looking purely art how Lesnar returned on Raw, it was simple, effective, impactful, and from a fan standpoint, incredible. After Cena asked The Rock to come back out to shake his hand and congratulate him on winning at WrestleMania, Lesnar came out to an immense boom response (I was there and it was insane), came to the ring, shook Cena’s hand, delivered an F5 and kicked Cena's hat. As a fan you likely completely forgot about the returning Alberto Del Rio and Lord Tensai (formerly A-Train) due to the impact of Lesnar's return.
