We get our DHA from algae-based capsules, not fish oil, to limit concerns about toxins in fish.

By popular demand, a space on the album has been reserved for "Marvins Room," an ethereal rumination originally released on Drake’s website. "Marvins Room" became a Top 40 hit, and suggested that Drake had lost none of his talent for writing pained confessionals.

It turns out, no one. Today I switched on the news to find out that Bonnie Sweeten and her daughter were found in Disney World. Bonnie had carefully parked her SUV in downtown Philadelphia and made the bogus 911 call, as well as a call to her husband asking him to tell her other children she loved them in case she never saw them again. Then she'd used an ID she'd taken from a co-worker to board a plane for a little vacation.

Revamping the restaurant, with the help of SMWM architects, has unleashed her creative juices. Keller fitted some of the best items on the Bizou menu, such as the tempura fried green beans ($6), into the new format. This dish is my litmus test by which all other frito misto is judged. The beans are coated in a puffy batter that crunches like corn flakes, releasing a gush of steam, yielding to tender green beans that are sweet and mild. She also kept the beef cheeks ($13) -- she was one of the first in the city to offer this once-overlooked cut of meat -- which are slowly braised to release the creamy gelatinous rivulets laced throughout the meat. She counters the richness with pungent horseradish and a peppery watercress salad.

Hey, Tony: I know you've stated in the past that games from out of division aren't always rotated evenly, but why is the Browns' game vs. the Chargers not in San Diego next year? The Browns have played at Oakland five times of the last eight seasons and will again in 2012. Conversely, the Browns have played at San Diego once since 1992. Why not factor this in when making the schedules?

It's a serious matter on several fronts. From a personal standpoint, the allegations suggest alcohol and anger management issues Young must address for the sake of his future, let alone his career. From a business standpoint, the Tigers can't risk alienating their fan base if they don't strongly convey their deep-rooted disappointment that one of their players could be criminally accused of such repulsive language. And from a competitive perspective, Young's lack of professionalism even putting himself in such a compromising situation sends the message through the rest of the clubhouse that he's not taking the challenge of playing hard every night as seriously as others.

With a fight already going on at midcourt in a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston, the Rockets' Tomjanovich ran in to try to play peacemaker. Instead, he got one of the worst shots in sports history _ a right hand from Washington, forever known around the NBA as "The Punch." Tomjanovich was unconscious and bleeding, eventually needing multiple operations to repair facial fractures. He also suffered a concussion and other serious injuries. Tomjanovich returned the next season, though was never the same player again.

It was dark by the time we arrived, got our key at the general store and moved into one of the older cabins, big enough to sleep four.

Shareholders would bear 10 percent of the costs under the proposal, providing some incentive for the company to minimize costs and negotiate aggressively with insurers to recover the outlays.
And they're fine, those TLC bars, but they're $5 a box. Discovering that I could make my own was truly life-changing. I could decide what I put in them, I saved money, I saved all that packaging, and we eat them every day. But everyone has their own unique food patterns. For someone who doesn't have kids and doesn't care about granola bars, maybe rolling their own pasta is revolutionary.

The production and consumption of the famous Cote d'Or ("Golden Hillside") wines is big business, and a good "nose" is a life skill worth developing. Your visit to Burgundy can include just about every aspect of the wine trade, right down to traditional barrel making. This time-honored craft is kept alive at cooperages, where crafting barrels is a mix of modern efficiency and traditional techniques. Workmen use steam and bands of iron to bend oak staves into wine-tight casks. The characteristics of the wood contribute to the personality of Burgundy's wine.

That's a crucial San Francisco value and is what, I believe, moved millions of voters at the polls last week. They saw not only what hypocrites some of their leaders were, but also saw the effects of that hypocrisy on people personally (Rev. Haggard's wife and kids, for instance) and also socially (Haggard visits the White House to help drive anti-gay policy, except when he's busy with a nose full of Tina and a dick in his mouth).

But let's also acknowledge that coupled with vision and the pursuit of excellence was hard-headed business strategizing. The triumph of iTunes, the App Store and the incipient Apple Cloud ushered in the era at Apple of network-esque complexity as well as the possibility of network-esque revenues. It made Mr. Jobs, despite himself, an empire builder. Success brought rivals like Google and Amazon. There came the need to anticipate moves and countermoves, the need to play defense. This was an unsung part of the Jobs C.V. in later years. And almost tactless to mention is the garish side effect: the rise of Apple to exceed Microsoft and on some days Exxon Mobil, as the world's most valuable company.

The grind of war continues this week 150 years ago in the Civil War as a contingent of some 3,000 Confederate fighters overrun a 1,000-man Union force at Front Royal in northern Virginia in a battle fought May 23, 1862. The Union fighters are pushed back by the surprise attack through the town of Front Royal, retreating under fire. They temporarily hold their ground on one hill and then another but are outnumbered and retreat. In the end, the Union forces are routed and hundreds of federal forces throw down their arms and surrender. All told, there are only about 50 casualties on the Confederate side while estimates indicate the Union suffered hundreds of dead or wounded. Confederate Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson was waging his bold hit-and-run campaign through the Shenandoah Valley this spring and the battle demonstrated the prowess of his and allied forces striking close enough to Washington to alarm the Lincoln government nearby. Only days earlier in May 1862, Jackson's forces had attacked Union fighters in McDowell, Va., pushing them back across the Potomac River. That attack prompted jitters among Lincoln and Cabinet leaders in the federal capital and triggered calls to keep more defensive forces arrayed around Washington. The victories by Jackson and his allies also spread alarm in the North and prompt renewed calls for more young men to fight for the Union. One proclamation this week 150 years ago called on Massachusetts men to join the fight. The call went out via local papers and declared: "The wiley and barbarous horde of traitors to the people, to the Government, to our country, and to our liberty, menace again the national capitol ... The President calls on Massachusetts to rise once more for its rescue and defense."

City officials say the area lacks the amenities — lights, recreational facilities — of parks that are open later. But the vast majority of city parks — all except some three dozen out of 400 — have installed the facilities and taken the necessary security steps to stay open late. Would it be so difficult to make some adjustments at City Hall? Or are the proposed regulations actually intended to prevent the return of theOccupy L.A.activists, who have indicated that they would like to begin holding their several-day-a-week meetings there rather than in Pershing Square?

I have a friend who wishes that were not so. She thinks it’s creepy that Mormons comb genealogical records to find people to retroactively baptize into the church -- people who were not Mormons when they were alive and probably would not want to be Mormons if they still were. Knowing that the one constant in Romney’s otherwise malleable set of beliefs is his religion, my friend cannot understand why the Obama campaign has not raised the oddities of Mormonism as an issue.
Two weeks ago, the Metropolitan Council and the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission concluded that the proposed $1.1 billion project in Arden Hills was "aggressive" and "unrealistic."

"You don't really get tired playing doubles," Cooper said.
We know the elite left tackle didn’t fall into the lap of the Bears with the 19th pick. They passed on Iowa’s Riley Reiff in selecting defensive end Shea McClellin 19th overall. Reiff went to the Detroit Lions with the 23rd pick, an option to help them rebuild an aging line. One of the knocks against Reiff: His arm length isn’t ideal for an offensive tackle. That was something critics said about Chris Williams when he was selected four years ago.

La Russa said the timing of those discussions — about the time the Cardinals appeared to be out of wild card contention before their miraculous run — was pure coincidence.

They've really committed themselves to the reckless abandon and beer-swilling charm of the early Replacements on their latest release, "Divine Providence." Consider the opening track, where John McCauley bellows "I'm a drunken devil/not the king of cool" in a voice that leaves no doubt that he could back that statement up.

Steve Rushin, SI.com: "Of the many famous bubbles the world has seen, from Housing Bubble to Dot-Com Bubble to Stock Market Bubble -- from Bubbles the Chimp to Seinfeld's Bubble Boy -- none has had the strange charisma or single-name star power of The Bubble, a fickle mistress still tormenting athletes well into its sixth decade. The Bubble is everywhere in early March, popping up (and often just-plain popping) beneath college basketball teams, none of whom wants to be on it, for The Bubble has come to refer almost exclusively to a state of late-February limbo in that sport: Teams not quite in, but not quite out, of the NCAA tournament."

Right now I'm also thinking about steamy Wednesday night. That's when I met Bob Simunic, who came across the yard and into the driveway to introduce himself.

Finally, with the Big East losing members and in danger of becoming the Big Deceased, Genshaft saw the benefit of opening the guard gate and inviting a school of UCF’s size, marketability and potential into USF’s neighborhood. She actually stood up and sponsored the motion to invite UCF into the league.

Topping off the growing stack of great stuff that vitamin D-3 does for you is this good news: Keeping your levels up dramatically lowers your risk for PDQ (Pee Doesn't Quit). Medically, it's called urinary incontinence. You probably call it "Oh no." Turns out there's one thing many of the 10 million women struggling with it share: low levels of D-3. It makes them (you?) a whopping 170 percent more likely to leak than those with a healthy level of D-3. Why? The vitamin may help muscle tone in your sphincter, the muscle that stops dribbles. (By the way, men leak, too; it's just a better-kept secret. We don't know yet whether low D affects guys.) The Department of Defense should be so lucky as to have such a simple way to prevent leaks. How to be sure you're not D-ficient? A simple blood test. We like to see D-3 levels between 50 and 80. If you're low (up to 75 percent of folks are, especially in winter), take 1,000 IU of D-3 a day; 1,200 after age 60. Include what's in your multivitamin and combo calcium-D-3-magnesium pill. Don't go over 2,000 IU unless your doc says to. Too much can harm bones and kidneys.

Like many successful restaurants -- especially in these times -- Higgins is several restaurants. It's upscale at dinner, when diners seek the right Oregon pinot gris to match a citrus and horseradish-crusted Alaskan halibut. Things are looser at lunch, when waves from City Hall and Portland State University roll in for the esteemed hamburger. Of course, being Higgins, it's called not "hamburger" but "grilled seasoned ground sirloin on a toasted house-made bun."

“Medina is a good team and are having a very good year. They have only lost 1 game. This game was really a game of two halves,” said Mike Battista, Brecksville-Broadview Heights head coach. “We had the better of play in the first half and they outplayed us in the second half. Chances came for us to grab our second goal before and after they tied the game up. It has been one of those years where scoring has been difficult for us.”
Gallup's findings help paint a grim picture of mass delusion in the United States about its rising weight and the spate of health problems that come with it. American parents are notoriously poor judges of their childrens' weight, as well. The result: Primary care physicians, long reluctant to lecture their patients about weight loss, now debate how best to break the news to patients and their parents that they are above their healthy weights.

We're just settling in when I notice one of my guests, an Italian, staring at something behind me. I turn around to see our waiter bearing a truly impressive specimen -- a live Alaskan king crab, the daddy longlegs of the crab world. The creature is a beautiful gray rose with bumps that makes it look like a piece of coral reef. Good disguise, no? He (or she) is a big one all right, weighing in at 8 pounds and some change. (The price is equally intimidating -- more than $240 at market price, but it makes a feast for a minimum of six, working out to $40 per person.)

Blast Roy for being honest if it makes you feel better. Wish him gone. But know he's devastated over his inability to feel comfortable dropping in and out of the game. It's why he let it rip to two reporters who cared to ask what it feels like to be forgotten.

Don Van Vliet, who recorded under the name Captain Beefheart, died on Friday, at the age of 69. I'm sure a lot of people who heard the news were only vaguely aware of him as an influential, experimental musician who critics were always raving about. He never sold a lot of records though, especially from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, he did have an ardent cult following. So, if you're curious, here's a Captain Beefheart Song of the Day.

• Jeff Miller, OC Register: Barkley take this advice: Head to the NFL: Barkley should go to the NFL because he's projected to be a top-10 pick and, unless that changes for the worse between now and the deadline to declare for the draft, the money and opportunity before him will be too large to pass up. His senior season at USC would be a year of lost earning power, significant earning power. It would put him another year away from free agency, in an occupation where the window to make real money can close absurdly fast and with no notice.
"To us, 85 degrees seems like nothing because we are used to 100 and 110 degrees in Phoenix," he says. "In Arizona, the sun burns your skin. It burns really fiercely. What is going to be hard for us is the cold. We aren't used to the cold."

And the biggest of my second guesses: Why such a hurry after the completion to Cruz on the first play after the 2-minute warning?

Relax, catch your breath, change your personnel and, hey, force Seattle to take a timeout to save some clock. But don’t do the work for them.
Consider the irony of the situation.
