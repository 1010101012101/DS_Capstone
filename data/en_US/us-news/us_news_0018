Now he's her fiance as well. And in that role he has grown protective, answering questions about Harrison's past curtly and in as few words as possible.
Dining: Instead of devoting a couple hours to one place, I went the progressive-dinner route: oysters at Hog Island Oyster Company; artichoke dip and a great flight of reds (better deal than by the glass) at Bounty Hunter; a craft brew and hearty plate of atmosphere at Downtown Joe's; salmon skin sushi at Morimoto; and Kobe Corn Dogs (upper crust meets county fair) at Carpe Diem Wine Bar.
The roomful of journalists from Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri scribbled fast as Horvit and other experienced reporters in the audience shared tips for backgrounding and deep web searches, finding information and contacts that many assumed had "disappeared" from the web, getting the most out of Illinois' open records law and other (for us!) fun stuff.
Amy Goldsmith, director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said independents are better off working for trucking companies.

Instead of reducing accountability for student achievement, we believe the waiver will help Oregon increase accountability.

Erdogan is Obama’s favorite regional ally. Washington has no problem following his cue. Perhaps his vision of a new Ottoman empire can pose a welcome counterbalance to Iran’s ambitions — for now. But Erdogan’s well-known volatility is one risk factor (as his confidence grows, he could turn on a dime and go against us); his “moderate” Islamism is another.

“We knew that we were going to staff this one,” said Sorge after the contest. “Sometimes when you get backed up with some rainouts you hate to have, particularly, your better guys sit and wait. We’ll just keep them on a rotation and get their work in. We’ve got conference games on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, so today, instead of them ‘penning’ (‘bull-penning’) them, (we put them) on some inning counts. They just went out there (pointing to the pitcher’s mound) to do some work instead of doing it over there (motioning to the bullpen). I think we could have thrown in the bullpen, but you get a little bit different juice flowing through your veins when you’re out there in a game. So that’s obviously a little bit more productive.”

The Queen Charlotte cuts across a pristine coastal ridgeline, through ancient forest and virgin bush. A sound is a former valley flooded by the sea, leaving haphazard slivers of land, surrounded by water but still adjoining the mainland on one side.

One example would be that we chose to locate a data center up at The Dalles in Oregon for lots of reasons. One reason was that the bulk of the power there comes from relatively clean sources. A lot of it is hydro, some of it is through wind. A lot of the growth in terms of additional power up there over time certainly could be wind, and our hope is to help make that happen.

Although the 11th-hour drama centered on the House and the Senate, Mr. O'Malley is ultimately the one in charge, and the debacle reflects badly on him. He had some harsh words after the fact — in a 1 a.m. news conference, he decried those who let "egos and pet projects" get in the way of the "common good," and this morning, he referred to the previous night's events as a "damn shame" that set the state back. Where was he a week ago when it was clear that the two chambers were on a collision course? He needed to be publicly and aggressively involved in pushing the debate from the start, but instead, he took a laissez-faire attitude toward the legislature's handling of the budget. Tweeting "Hopeful that the GA will pass a compromise that protects priorities like education while creating jobs & expanding opportunity" two hours and 13 minutes before the legislature is set to adjourn doesn't cut it.

No wonder. For as Californians consider those insights into the uneven progress of women in this state, the national political campaigns — and the atmosphere around them — continue to supply jarringly anachronistic attacks. Mitt Romney has pledged to "get rid" of Planned Parenthood. A number of states have passed abusive laws to discourage legal abortions or to harass women who obtain them. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich have accused the Obama administration of interfering with religious liberty by insisting that insurance plans cover contraception.

Given the huge problems facing our nation right now, this is no time to be sending a rookie to Congress.

The game world will be a 3-D simulation of Walden Pond and the neighboring woods outside Concord, Mass., where Thoreau lived in a cabin for two years during the 1840s, writing journal entries that he later turned into “Walden, or Life in the Woods,” his masterpiece of nature writing and philosophy.

But it's also a city with immediate nonfictional problems, and Friday's debate provided useful indications of how the candidates would address them. It also gave the candidates direct opportunities for pokes at each other, with Charlie Hales looking at his competitors and warning that being mayor isn't like running a store or serving in a legislature, and state Rep.

Enjoy fresh produce, eat bean burritos instead of beef burritos and explore new vegan foods, such as marinated tofu kebabs, curried chickpeas and falafel. If you're going to a ballgame, order a veggie dog rather than a hot dog -- pork is the fourth most environmentally harmful food on the EWG's list.

Juicy burgers, beefy hot dogs, shakes so thick you can barely suck them through straw and you get the mixing cup, too. This is it: milkshake nirvana, a real-deal diner and a rarity in these days of theme-parky impostors and cut-rate operations. Hovering around $4 for essentially two servings, shakes are both perfect and inexpensive -- an almost too-good-to-be-true combination. The butterscotch tastes like liquefied Brach's candy, while malteds pack a punch of robust flavor.

A newer entry into the rental market is homes being rented by owners who haven't been able to sell. With information on local rental prices widely available online, these first-time landlords will likely be asking for market prices, says Jed Smith, managing director for quantitative research at the National Association of Realtors. Since their ultimate goal is to sell the property, these landlords may be more serious about maintenance of the property than a landlord who owns multiple properties, he says. So make sure a lease specifies who is responsible for taking care of—and paying for—what.

They're being dropped by the old — Betty White on TV Land's "Hot in Cleveland" — and the very young — Jane Levy's Tessa on ABC's "Suburgatory" — and in scripted and non-scripted shows alike. A recent episode ofBravo's new reality show "Shahs of Sunset" was titled "It's My Birthday, Bitches." Two of ABC's midseason comedies brazenly revolve around the word — "Don't Trust the B— In Apartment 23" and "GCB," which was originally titled "Good Christian Bitches." (Well, maybe not so brazenly. The network eventually decided the actual word was too incendiary for a broadcast audience.)

The Meieran campaign's interest in drawing a contrast between the occupations of the two candidates got back to the Williamson campaign after Firestone talked about it with some union officials.
The stoppage was seen as a test of whether unions have the support to stage a full-blown general strike over labor market reforms the Socialist government says it will impose by decree very soon if the unions do not reach agreement on their own with management. The reforms are deemed critical to resurrecting Spain's moribund economy and reassuring jittery investors who have sent the government's borrowing costs soaring.

When it comes to main courses, Craft is strongest on meat, which is of the highest quality and expertly cooked. Think lamb is ho-hum? Try the Ellensburg roasted lamb sirloin, a deep, rosy pink and almost velvety in texture and served sliced off the bone (bone included, though) in its own juices. It's a superb cut of meat treated with great respect. A sampler of roasted and braised Niman Ranch pork with fat cranberry beans and pickled peppers features the pork loin, sumptuous pork belly and delightful pork cracklings. Every bite is different.

Mildred Loving, who died in 2008, apparently didn't think much of the 1996 movie "Mr. and Mrs. Loving," starring Lela Rochon and Timothy Hutton. She would like "The Loving Story," especially hearing her husband (killed in a car accident in 1975) say, "I love my wife." That's one thing viewers will remember; another is the final freeze frame on Mildred's face.

This is where China and its $3.2 trillion in foreign reserves come in. If China were to contribute to a bailout fund that Europe wants to build up to $1.4 trillion, it would surely ask for concessions in return, like the Europeans dropping their criticism of China's undervalued currency. China also might wonder why it should come to the rescue of a European Union that still has it under an arms embargo. History comes full circle, with the ascendant Chinese in a position to extract concessions from erstwhile colonial powers.
Ratmansky's "Firebird," requiring a cast of 36 dancers, loosely follows Fokine's original libretto, based on Russian folk legends. Ivan, a nobleman, enters a mysterious forest and captures a Firebird who gives him a magic feather. He wanders into Kaschei's territory, discovers the spellbound maidens and falls in love with one of them. Kaschei unleashes his supernatural power, but at the height of danger, the Firebird returns and dances the crowd to distraction until Ivan can grab the secret egg holding Kaschei's soul and break the spell. Ratmansky uses the maidens, who become Kashchei's zombied thralls, to replace Kaschei's monsters, featured in most versions.

And so it was all evening - popular classical music selections accompanying 16 different acts. Ropes were twirled during "Hoe Down;" Kabalevsky's "The Comedians" was the perfect background for the hectic dog show; Falla's "Ritual Fire Dance" made the smoky hand-to-hand athleticism of Duo Voltart even more sensuous; the Lyra-Elliaire Duet did intricate (and dangerous!) formations on two interlocking rings high above the stage to Copland's "Corral Nocturne;" and 12 jugglers with three bowling pins each were spurred on by Stravinsky's "Circus Polka."

"I'm just so happy for our fans," Pacers coach Frank Vogel said. "They've endured a lot those years when we struggled. To finally see us come back and have a winning team again and somebody that has a chance to do something special this year. That's what they deserve. Pacers basketball is back."
We'd also like to see the Legislature look again at a proposal pushed by state Attorney General John Kroger that would have stripped tax-deductible status from most charities that spend less than 30 percent of their budget on direct services.

Well, OK, you say, but Olbermann isn't really a journalist; he's a commentator. And that's true. Anyone who has listened to him for five minutes doesn't have a shred of doubt where he stands. He doesn't have any objectivity to compromise. But he does operate out of a newsroom, after all, and anchored the network's Election Night coverage. And it was interesting to learn that the policy he violated was not necessarily even that he donated money to a campaign, but that he didn't receive the blessing of his bosses before he did it. (In case you're wondering, conservative Fox TV news doesn't even have that caveat regarding political donations by its staff.)

The fate of the undergraduate class has been in question since Newark Archbishop John J. Myers issued a statement last month saying "the course is not in synch with Catholic teaching." The dispute between the conservative archbishop and university administrators who approved the class has attracted national attention.
During his life, Titanic killed five men, always successfully pleading self-defense. He also married five women, all in their teens when they tied the knot. He was restless, cool, dangerous … a specialist in the short con, a proposition man. He'd suggest improbable wagers, having first engineered or prepared the scenario to guarantee he'd win. He once bet Al Capone that he, Titanic, could throw a lemon onto the roof of a five-story hotel. The lemon was loaded with buckshot, having been previously planted on a fruit-vendor's stall. Capone, in the dark, took the bet and lost $500. A near-genius as a poker player, Titanic rigged the fabled all-night game that led to the death, in 1928, of Arnold Rothstein, the man who fixed the 1919 World Series (and the inspiration for Meyer Wolfsheim, the sinister gambler in "The Great Gatsby").

Portland actress Ellen Bloodworth also gave voice to lots of locals' feelings in her own "Portlandia" scene. Another first-episode sketch featured Armisen as a member of an adult hide-and-seek league playing in a Portland Community College library. Bloodworth's character sits down at a table with a book, only to discover Armisen's character hiding under the table. He asks her not to give him away; she looks at this grown man playing a kids' game and asks him, in a tone of grandmotherly common sense, "Why don't you just get a job and go to work like a normal person?"
And so did Brokaw. Animating the building in this way made us fall in love all over again.

It's key that we all understand the origin of the movement  and that the movement itself has grown into a more amorphous and uncontrolled version of that orchestrated start. As cities have worked to dampen the protests and accompanying problems, the most passionate of those involved are planning strategy to take it to the next level, not to fade quietly into the winter fog.

The two left El Salvador — which was probably for the best — and landed in Nicaragua. "The two countries were nothing alike," she writes. "El Salvador was your basic mail-order military dictatorship: terror and torture, stuttering civilians. Nicaragua was more like a cheerful Communist kazoo concert." With supplies for the Sandinista regime coming from the Soviet Union, left-leaning foreigners — Internacionalistas, they were called — flocked to the country, some lending real support, some holding inappropriately festive rallies.
