But Curtis has dreams. Nightmares, more to the point, of motor-oil-esque rain falling from the sky, of an apocalyptic storm, of shadowy, menacing figures outside the windows, of the beloved family dog turning on him. They are disturbingly vivid, unusually realistic and especially troubling to Curtis.
I rode the rails, on a kiddie train, at the Brevard Zoo in Melbourne (brevardzoo.com), where it's possible to feed a giraffe and stand as close as you'll ever be to a Florida bobcat and other creatures in five "loops": Expedition Africa, La Selva (modeled after the rain forests of South America), Austral-Asia, Wild Florida and Paws on Play.

What I want to remember most is that I, we, aren't entitled to live this next year. Perhaps that sounds dramatic, but as a nurse and a person who has lived long enough to experience tragedy, I know from experience that nothing is certain and every moment and day we're given is precious. I continue to find that many of the things I take for granted crumble away to nothing. But we don't have to think about what we lack to realize what we have: even if it's not a hoard of opened gifts filling out closets, garages, or drawers. We have each been given so much that was never ours to begin with.

The restaurant doesn't have a big wine list, but it's full of interesting choices at good prices. For example, the sparkling wine by the glass is Tissot's fine Cremant du Jura. There's a Santa Barbara Riesling from Tatomer next to Doug Margerum's Pinot Gris and a dry Furmint from Hungary's Kiralyudvar, even a half-bottle of Domaine Tempier Bandol rosé. And one of my favorite Cabernet Francs, Breton's Bourgueil (also offered by the glass).
Schwarzenegger marched into Sacramento promising to change California's dysfunctional spending process for good.

How Amar’e Stoudemire is integrated, because it doesn’t look the Knicks consider him particularly relevant to their cause. Also, anyone on the Heat not considered one of their Big 3.

My parents (Vera and Nicholas Gecsy) were just wonderful -- both of them highly intelligent but without formal education. My mother was a fabulous homemaker, but she also worked in the same National Malleable (iron and sand casting) foundry as my father. They were core makers -- a very, very, blue-collar job. My father was scientifically oriented; he knew the constellations. My mother had a lovely singing voice. There was always music in our house. Her baking was renowned. I never remember going to sleep without my mother reading to my brother and me.

Many things can aggravate insomnia's symptoms: working, not working, needing to get up in the morning, having said or done something cringe-worthy earlier in the day, or week or lifetime. The future can trigger symptoms, as can the past, as can having children, a spouse, parents, siblings, co-workers, neighbors, friends, acquaintances, relatives or none of the above. Concerns about encroaching global stupidity, catastrophic weather anomalies, dust bunnies under the armoire or the inevitability of death can all set off the disorder.

-- No more unlimited data plans. AT&T has stopped offering unlimited data plans in favor of plans with monthly data usage caps and overage fees. T-Mobile USA still offers "unlimited" data for smartphones for $30 per month, but slows downloads after 5 gigabytes of traffic in a month.

Over the years, SUVs have stood for a lot of things: glorified pickups, cul-de-sac fads, gas hogs. But the SUV that lorded over the rest - Land Rover's inimitable Range Rover - transcended the fracas with its own brand of damn-the-torpedoes capability. The 2012 model, which starts at $79,425 and approaches $200,000 in an impossibly decadent Autobiography Ultimate Edition, remains as transcendent as ever.

Massie devotes fully half his text to a vivid narrative of the difficult years prior to Elizabeth's death in late 1761. We see Catherine developing the formidable skills she would ably deploy as empress. She adroitly handled her puerile husband and his imperious aunt with a guileful blend of charm, submissiveness and carefully chosen moments of defiance. She cultivated supporters in the Russian aristocracy alienated by Peter's worship of all things German. Catherine, by contrast, adopted the Orthodox faith and quickly learned to speak fluent Russian. When Peter, upon acceding to the throne, secularized all Russian church property and switched sides to support Prussia in the Seven Years' War, the stage was set for the bloodless coup that made Catherine empress in June 1762: Peter, strangled by her supporters probably without Catherine's knowledge, was the only casualty.

The idea remains contingent on whether the grounds are converted to green space in time for the 2012 event and whether the rewards of a radical reinvention of the footprint would be worth the risks to the festivals artistic integrity and community profile.

It seems safe to expect more discussion of that issue when the court issues its ruling later this year.

One pleasure of this film is how splendidly detailed director Yonebayashi and his team have made this small, small world.

The bombing campaign and naval embargo, launched after Gadhafi had vowed to slaughter civilians in rebel-held Benghazi, went poorly at first as government fighters responded by stepping up ground attacks.

Santorum's right that Romney hasn't offered a distinctive theme for his leadership. He's come across as more of a Mr. Fix-It than a visionary, someone who responds to events rather than pulling the country in a particular direction. But that critique didn't prompt Romney to make a better case for his leadership qualities. Instead, the main thing Santorum seems to have inspired Romney and his supporters to do is spend a lot more money on negative ads.

Then in 1962, Jamaica got its independence and the people wanted to find their own identity. They looked to Africa and found this royal family with a 3,000-year lineage that supposedly comes from King Solomon, and they said: We come from that. We have our own great culture and history that we should be studying.

The walleye fishing around the Western Basin has been slow this week, but is heating up with the calmer waters and warmer temperatures. Some walleye are still being caught on lead-head, hair-skirted jigs with stinger hooks on the reefs, but most of the post-spawn walleye are now moving to deeper waters off the reefs. Trolling fishermen have been doing well with minnow-style plugs and spinner rigs tipped with nightcrawlers off the main reef complex, and in deeper waters west of the Bass Islands.
