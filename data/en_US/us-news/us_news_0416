Cacao Tree Café is tiny, but its freshness and big flavors have won fans for owner Amber Poupore's raw, vegan, organic foods and smoothies. Poupore, former manager of nearby Inn Season Café, has studied raw foods all over the country and her well-crafted dishes reflect it. She offers some salads made with cooked rice and grains and two cooked soups daily; all other items are raw, including the Cacao Tree's antioxidant-rich, handmade dark chocolates and other desserts on display in the front cooler. Virtually all of the exceptional smoothies include some kind of greens; try the gingery, berry-rich Inner Warmth, or the striking Bee Green, which includes avocado, peaches and spinach and a garnish of local bee pollen. The regular menu features salads and dishes such as tacos with seed-based "tortillas" and "pastas" of zucchini strands. Several daily specials are offered, such as Creamy Mushroom Lasagna with sliced zucchini for pasta, "meat" made with nuts and herbs, and a creamy mushroom sauce made with cashews, dill and lemon, served atop local organic arugula.

Jepsen: The line 'Before you came into my life I missed you so bad' was in fact written and inspired by the guy that I am seeing now, actually.

Beane has things to say about not trusting appearances, and the importance of passionate engagement versus fear of commitment — whether to an ideal or to other people. But he never speechifies, preferring to lob snappy one-liners. Lysistrata, for instance, got her name because her parents “were on the fringe of society. They were theater majors.”
Observers speculated that the famously abrasive investor planned an assault on the venerable software company, but Icahn said Thursday that everything had been going fine -- until last week.

Prediction: This is by far the toughest major category to call, and not just because Adele isn’t nominated. Minaj is the biggest name here, but Grammy voters do not like to give this award to rappers — and the presence of Cole on the ballot may split the hip-hop vote. No electronic music deejay has ever won this award, and it is hard to see the impish Skrillex becoming the first. Bon Iver might snatch this one, too, but I think it’s most likely to go to the Band Perry, an old-fashioned family singing act that cleaned up at the CMAs earlier this year.
The school has a long standing relationship with Nike, and uniforms are something that Oregon probably has plenty of lying around. The football team, for instance, uses multiple combinations every season and that means plenty to spare and auction off for some extra cash.
Art Garfamudis, ESPN.com: "This year, Mets manager Terry Collins got upset with shortstop Ruben Tejada because he showed up on time at camp. On time. It used to be a manager would save his wrath for the guy that came four days late stinking of gin with a go-go dancer passed out in the backseat of his rent-a-car. Now they get mad when the players don't come early. What's the logical conclusion to this? Winter-long spring training, right? Management could argue that these guys make so much money that they should report to camp on Nov. 1 to start getting ready for next season. Of course, the real go-getters will leave the team in the last week of the regular season to report to camp to get a jump on things."
He produced only two loose shots all day — a hook off the tee at No.10 that caromed off a boundary fence and an approach at the par-five 16th that just cleared the water fronting the green.

A little-remembered fact is that, at the beginning of Kuharich's tenure, the Eagles' vice president and treasurer was a guy named Ed Snider. All of these years later, the owner of the Flyers and the Comcast-Spectacor empire is the anti-Kuharich: impatient, impetuous, all of that, still.

This time, the AP examined the documents over several hours Thursday in a conference room of a resort just outside of Phoenix and a few miles from the posh Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, where McCain receives most of his medical care under a pseudonym - which the AP was asked not to disclose. Coincidentally, the release came the same week that McCain's close friend, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, revealed that he had a cancerous brain tumor.
Throughout the set, Rickly kept mentioning how the band couldn’t believe that its humble origins playing New Brunswick basements had led to a 13-year career and the celebration of a decade-old album. He was joined onstage for several songs by Tom Schlatter, formerly of the Jersey band You and I, who provided some of the screaming parts on “Full Collapse” when it was recorded.
One of them, the Omni San Francisco, offered a $120 savings and was closer to his meeting.

Cases like Becker's, however, aren't unheard of. St. Charles County Prosecutor Jack Banas recalled a 2009 crash in which a car struck two nuns crossing a dark street in O'Fallon, Mo., after they returned from a group outing at a Cardinals game. One of the nuns died of her injuries, but Banas didn't charge the driver - even though she wasn't paying attention - because the woman wasn't speeding, drinking or violating traffic laws.

A buoyant, slender girl with curly black hair, Arcelia Flores was one of 10 children from a family of subsistence-level farmers.

Ruben, like Zimmerman, said he abides by the freeze except in the case of an essential hire.
What's more: While 17 players have actually seen the pitch this year, only the top 12 have accrued more than 90 minutes on the field (and Bunbury has just over that mark with 92). The most popular substitutes, Paulo Nagamura and Jacob Peterson, have logged just 85 and 52 minutes of action, respectively.
"I really think the kinds of skills we learn to deal with are learned on the job," said district Capt. Michael Locati, 54, of Novato. "You get a sense, or most people do, just by being out there. A sense of what to look for, what someone looks like who might be intent on taking their life."

Which — no surprise — ensured a sequel. But while “Happy Feet Two” brings back the characters and obsessions of the first film, it doesn’t go anywhere new or seem to have any reason to be — other than to push some tickets and sell some plush toys.
With Verizon's new data plan comes a new tiered pricing system: Data plans will start at $50 per month for 5 gigabytes or $80 per month for 10 gigabytes. A gigabyte is enough for thousands of e-mails and Web page views but can be quickly eaten up by watching or sending video streams from the Internet.
Freddie Mac called White's foreclosure and eviction lawful.

The Senate's State and Local Government committee has scheduled a hearing on House Bill 318, which moves both primaries to May.

The most important factor to revive the middle class in America is to support small business.
Major market indexes seesawed throughout much of Tuesday's trading session, but managed to end higher. Investors battled worries over rising loan losses at regional banks and a mixed report from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who cautioned that the economy's recovery will be gradual because of rising unemployment. But he also assured investors that inflation will be subdued once the economy is back on track.
Cameron, who himself has been tainted by the scandal after hiring an ex-News of the World editor, continued to distance himself from a once-cozy relationship with the Murdochs.
The Mintons have no intention of bailing on the Roseville track and, despite the large orange "For Sale" sign visible to motorists on Riverside Avenue, the landowners have no intention of booting BMX. The Joseph family, which owns the oak-dotted, 34-acre property, does indeed want to sell ("It's actually been for sale since we got here 26 years ago," Bruce Minton said), but family spokesman Michael Joseph said the Mintons' five-year lease is solid.

The sheriff also boasted of kicking federal civil rights investigators out of his office.

Director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan have discarded most of the conventions of film biographies and chosen to construct more of a memory poem. It makes for a movie that is highly personal in every sense of the word. Even the political highs and lows that come to Thatcher in flashbacks are of a more private sort: how isolated she felt as a woman in a man's world. Why she was willing to lose the hat, but not the pearls, during a campaign media makeover.
øBut even among the acknowledged strength of this draft, while there is very good depth, there is very little marquee, star quality to the top guys. In fact, we don't see a true No. 1 blue-liner emerging out of this year's crop. While a kid like Ryan Murray might have great value as a smooth-skating, savvy shutdown defender who can move the puck and will be a captain in the league for 10 years, his style of play is more along the lines of a Kevin Lowe or a Glen Wesley rather than a Paul Coffey.

This year, she was sentenced to 16 years in federal prison after being identified as a leader in a human trafficking ring based in cantinas and restaurants the couple co-owned. Belmontes pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harboring illegal aliens. A judge in April ordered their real estate sold to benefit five teenage trafficking victims.
Lonny Massey, an owner of the Clarkchester Apartments, contended "it's too expensive to develop without TIF, and, in a depressed economy, the city shouldn't pass on this opportunity."
I remember tasting Pillsbury's wine and reacting in a rather uncouth fashion by stating: "I can't believe this is Arizona wine." . . . We did a couple of winemaker dinners at Prado and found that guests were very happy. Last fast-forward: FnB is 2 weeks old. Chef Charleen Badman's cooking philosophy is to try and source local, organic and sustainable whenever possible. I began to think about the possibility of exercising the same ideology with the wine list. It was simply a question: Is there enough good juice in AZ to construct a list?

No doubt your sister is right that she does not sincerely feel respect or gratitude, even to people who do her favors or give her presents. But as she should realize from her father's cruel behavior, even such minor favors as passing the salt need not be granted.
Coal mining is a dangerous enough occupation when every precaution is in place and every rule of safety is strictly followed. That Massey executives apparently chose to heighten the hazards and lie about it proves the necessity of a bill like Rockefeller's.
The leading Chinese delegate to the forum, Cheng Siwei, seemed to agree with the criticism.

But maybe the most striking thing was the announced crowd of 18,923, which cheered and was loud in key stretches. Yes, Cleveland, despite LeBron James bolting for Miami and having the league's worst record, continues to draw fans.

Bob Ford, Philadelphia Inquirer, on Eagles star DeSean Jackson: "He went through the charade of an aborted holdout that gained him nothing, and every indication is that the receiver is very upset the Eagles haven't crowned him with an exorbitant new contract. The team holds the leverage here and showed its muscle by making Jackson the No. 1 punt returner, a high-risk assignment that should make Jackson think twice about playing this season without taking whatever security he can get. What we don't know is if Jackson and agent Drew Rosenhaus are demanding crazy money, or if the Eagles simply aren't interested in a serious negotiation with a talented player, but one who is subject to injury and is a bit of a pain in the tail. This situation could be resolved soon, but it could also blow up into something ugly this season."
"I would ask why the state is looking to do this. I don't want to sound like I'm skeptical, but I am to some degree," Licastro said.

Electrifying and improving the Los Angeles to Orange County route would cost $6 billion and save only 10 minutes of travel time, said rail authority Chairman Dan Richard.
The Commerce Department report on orders to factories for manufactured goods rose 0.3 percent in December. That was far less than the 2 percent advance economists had expected. And for all of 2009, durable goods orders plunged 20.2 percent, the largest drop on records dating to 1992.
Investigators said Terri Horman was the last known person to see Kyron, when she told authorities she left him about 8:45 a.m. June 4 at Skyline School. She snapped a photo of the second-grader wearing a "CSI" T-shirt and beaming a smile beside his science fair exhibit earlier and posted it that day on her Facebook page. She and her husband waited for Kyron at the school bus stop not far from their home that afternoon, and when he didn't get off the bus, they went to the school. The school hadn't contacted the family when Kyron didn't return to his classroom after the science fair.
"The hysteria, the media circus, it's just crazy," Lee said. "It's the craziest damn thing I've ever seen, and it's sad. It's sad for the city of Sanford, the police department, because I know in my heart we did a good job."

TriMet is at that point now, as it raises fares and angles for more tax money before getting its labor costs under control. The transit agency shouldn't be surprised by Wednesday's rally against the new fare hikes and service cuts -- and it certainly shouldn't be shocked if voters reject the transit agency's bond measure this fall.
Yet, nine months on, Locke's key role in the recent drama over blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng has put him on the front lines of U.S. concerns about China's embattled dissident community. Chen's sudden escape from house arrest and a U.S. decision to give him sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy gave Locke his first crisis as ambassador, made him a target of criticism from Beijing and earned him respect from the human rights lobby.
Associated Press writers Meghan Barr and Karen Matthews in New York, David Dishneau in Hagerstown, Md., and Jessica Gresko in Fort Meade, Md., contributed to this report.
* I like Ken Hitchcock's reaction to the hit job on Pietrangelo. I know that for many of you it would be satisfying to hear the Blues coach ranting and raving and assailing the idiots that run the NHL ... but that does nothing for his team. Hitchcock doesn't want to peddle in excuses or weakness. He doesn't want his team to develop a woe-is-us victim complex and give into the adversity. His message is simple and necessary: no matter who lines up for the Blues, the team's objective is to play much better than they did in Game 1. All of the focus should be on that. This team overcame injuries all season, and this is no time to be carping about officials or sniffling over Petro's injury. The Stanley Cup playoff are all about survival. You have to be mentally strong.
As of this writing, Gordon hasn't struck out in his past 10 at-bats but he's getting jammed with more frequency. As long as the offense is producing enough, they can get by with Gordon's defense. But I like the idea of Lillibridge getting more playing time. He's 5-for-5 in steal attempts and is giving the Sox the same energy he gave them last year before he got hurt.

The cluster strategy is even giving hope to city officials who became concerned when the state dropped plans in February to move Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare from Sagamore Hills Township to a 14-acre site on Euclid Avenue.

"You have to hear O'Neill's music, catch the rhythm of his speeches," said Lane. "You could accuse O'Neill of being repetitive and schematic, but there is a method to his madness, and when the play starts to overtake you it's a hell of a sensation. He's asking you to jump off a cliff with him, to go into the darkest places in your soul."

The film was a box-office flop. "Nobody went to go see it," lamented Ian Petrella of Pasadena, who, as a child actor, played Randy Parker, younger brother of Ralphie, played by Peter Billingsley. "It got a ton of wonderful reviews, but nobody, I guess, was really interested in seeing it at the time.

Monday morning is not usually a great time. The phone rings non-stop. My own “to call” list is a mile long.

When he released "K.I.D.S.," the mixtape that first caught most rap blogs' attention, in August 2010, there was a sleazy charm to Mac's persona. He was the young slacker making no-cred-necessary rap songs about raging, sneakers and hooking up. It was superficial, but catchy and executed well-enough to find its way to the masses of high schoolers and college kids most interested in their Friday nights. Simply put, it's the type of rap that doesn't require much thought at all.

The "Occupy Wall Street" protests that demanded reform within financial institutions was one way to raise awareness about what has gone wrong in the business and financial world.

Q. How do you lose $2 billion?
GMs deal with the UAW creates a simpler profit-sharing formula, caps payouts at $12,000 annually and ties profit-sharing to North American profits, rather than just money made by U.S. plants. Workers will receive a maximum of roughly $1,000 for every $1 billion GM North America makes before taxes and interest. That will give workers up to $1,000 more annually than the old formula, but the old formula had no cap. GM chose to tie payouts to North American earnings because of the increased transparency, Ammann said. U.S. profits arent reported in quarterly earnings, but anyone can see GMs North American profits each quarter.
Galindo concedes that contractors rarely, if ever, used the center, which was meant to be an organized hiring system that would supplant the chaotic method of having dozens of workers surround any car that pulled over.

Mozzarella is just too stringy. It sits on top of the meat, without fusing into it. It's too dry. You'll realize that in the standard version, the white American melts down and then soaks up the beef juices, forming a sort of beef-and-cheese emulsion: the nectar of the Philly gods. The only thing better is the juice that drips out of the cheese steak with mushrooms.

The secondary continues to look good — or is it Sean Mannion not looking great? — as Rashaad Reynolds picked off two Mannion passes, both of which were intended for Markus Wheaton. Obum Gwacham made yet another athletic catch — this one involved twisting around midair to snag a pass with two guys on him — and Riley said, again, that it’s just a matter of time before he breaks out.

Clement's response was that the sheer size and expense of Medicaid made it politically impossible for states to drop out and run an alternative program. That's because state residents wouldn't be willing to shoulder the burden of paying taxes into Medicaid and a similar program just for the poor and disabled in their state. "We all know that in the real world that to the extent that the federal government continues to increase taxes, that decreases the ability of the states to tax their own citizenry. And it's a real tradeoff," Clement argued.

We laughed so hard we cried.
The "Nebraska" backstory: After "The River" in 1980, Springsteen recorded 10 demos for a sixth album. He intended to pass the cassette around so the E Street Band could learn the tunes, but along the way, Springsteen decided to simply release the recordings as-is. For a performer as bombastic as Bruce, it was a bold move to drop an LP of primarily voice and guitar, unadorned and unvarnished. Adding to the gravitas of the record were the lyrics themselves - dark, pessimistic tales of losers and serial killers, of the haunted and hopeless.
Gould was turned away as the federal government was phasing in its Secure Flight watch-list matching program requiring airlines and third-party booking agents such as Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity, to collect and submit passengers' full legal names, birth dates and gender to the TSA at least 72 hours in advance of travel.

And the Rams really liked Jenkins. But not at No. 14. After Blackmon was out, why would we expect the Rams to settle for a decent but not imposing WR with the 14th pick? Why force it? It's how you get in long-term roster trouble. But where the Rams did lose out -- apparently -- was on the gamble that Jenkins would be there at the top of the second round. (This is a bit perplexing to me; Jenkins is viewed by many as a slot receiver. Don't the Rams have a few of those? They need a wideout that can provide a threat on the outside. They don't have one.)

The proposed legislation would lift the cap on how much casinos can pay ot out-of-state race tracks for simulcast signals. Whelan said the price of simulcast feeds has increased over the years and the cap has kept the casinos from spending money for feeds patrons want.

#10 GETTING THERE IS FASTER AND EASIER. For years, travelers from the United States were forced to fly into the remote Narita airport, an hour or more from the city, a cruel slog after a 12+ hour flight. With the opening of the super-central Haneda Airport to international flights (for example, American now flies to Haneda nonstop) -- it's like LaGuardia, close to everything, but with multiple trains coming right into the terminals -- you can get there and get going much faster. It's Tokyo, after all. You don't have a moment to spare.
The former senator from Pennsylvania said that Romney's success in making money at the private equity firm Bain Capital was "very different than going out and creating an atmosphere for people to create" jobs. The country doesn't need a chief executive to manage the federal government, he added.

Nobody wants to make mistakes, but if you made a mistake back then, it was a disaster from a financial standpoint. You are talking about what is supposed to be a really good football player. Everybody wants the 10 year Pro Bowler, which is fine, but I'll take the two year Pro Bowler rather than a bust. You don't want a bust, you can't have a bust. That's what you are trying to avoid."

Jones calls himself "doctor" as do members of his church, but the title comes from an honorary degree that hangs on his office wall. He says he was given the diploma by the California Graduate School of Theology, an obscure school that boasts on its Web site that it's so independent, it has never been accredited.

Stoudemire's availability — and New York's hopes — for the rest of this Eastern Conference first-round series against the Miami Heat look bleak at best, first because the Knicks were beaten 104-94 on Monday night to fall into a 2-0 hole in the best-of-seven matchup, then because of whatever emotions boiled over near the locker room afterward.

I miss the gutsy cooking Hatfield did at Cortez in San Francisco when he first crossed my radar. It strikes me that at this restaurant (and the old one as well) his cooking is too polite.

As good as the performance was, the identity of the Protégé Project seemed yet to be established. Part of the idea behind its inception last year was to bring younger crowds from the neighborhoods around the clubs where the concerts are held, but Sunday, at least, the crowd looked to be CMNW regulars. The bar in the performance space itself was closed, leaving patrons to wait in a long line for the harried bartender next door -- which was neither here nor there as far as the music is concerned, but it killed the club vibe that was a key feature of last summer's Mississippi Studios show. Still, the festival is selling out these concerts and featuring solid performances besides, so that may be good enough.

For Zuni Chicken Stock, I purchased a whole 51/2-pound organic chicken (just under $16) and about $1 worth of vegetables. The breast on this large bird, which I removed and cooked for dinner the following night, weighed about 11/4 pounds, so let's subtract $3.50 from the price of the chicken. That makes an investment of $13.50, for which I got nine cups of stock ($1.50 per cup). Boxed organic chicken broth at my local market was $3.79 a quart, or about 95 cents per cup.

In his Friday letter, Loeb argued that Thompson has to be dumped to avoid "irreparable damage to Yahoo's culture." He argues Yahoo's own code of ethics justifies firing Thompson "for cause," a move that probably would prevent him for qualifying for a severance package.

On a recent trip to France, I couldn't help but notice that for most individuals -- myself included -- the allure of a French patisserie is unrivaled. Its glass pastry counters beckon passers-by with cocoa-dusted domes, layers of flaky puff pastry and glazed fruit fillings the colors of brilliant jewels. I was hooked after my first encounter.

"It gets challenging here, and it's not for everyone," the principal said. "Some of them don't want to work hard to get a B or a C, but we say, 'Pay now, not later.' The best feedback we get is from our alumni telling us how easy college is."
Tipton had no such prior connection to Stillman's work — she was convinced to take the role in part by the enthusiastic response of her "Crazy Stupid Love"costar Julianne Moore to hearing that the director was making a new film.

The plane crashed only 20 feet from a house but it was not damaged and people inside were not injured, Thompson said. He said the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating.
Nor do its other energy options look much better. Trying to tap offshore reserves in the South China Sea has roiled relations with Asian neighbors. Another neighbor, Russia, is the world’s biggest oil producer — but it’s hard to see Beijing allowing its ancient rival to control its flow of energy. (Moscow has already shown it’s unafraid to shut off the oil and gas tap in order to intimidate the Europeans.)

The dog was doing its job. It was trying to take a bite out of crime last Saturday afternoon.
MARK SPENCER: No. There is no suspicious conduct, and the law presumes everyone is in the country legally. The officer could question the men if their conduct was suspicious or in some way connected with criminal activity (i.e. citizen called in about drinking alcohol in public, illegal dumping, urinating in public, etc.) and there was reasonable suspicion to believe they were in the country illegally.
But Antawn Jamison, the Cavs' second-leading scorer, says that's not the right way to look at it.
"We alll still think we're kind of hip and cool around here because we are in radio and get to do these fun things," says Anderson. "But that's not really true. We are really out of touch with the younger generation. That song is an anthem for them now. So, I figured I'd write an athem for our generation, you know the people who spend their time at Home Depot and Bed Bath & Beyond, who drive around in minivans and go to dinner parties, who have to watch what they eat."
In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $115 million, or $1.33 per share, on revenue of $567 million.

But even this year, as we confidently coached our Turkey Training Camp trainees through what we assumed would be a no-fail feast (see last week's story, "Thanksgiving 101," online at sfgate.com/food), we had some blunders. Working Cook columnist Tara Duggan's team got jicama-happy while making the raw cranberry relish, and had to remake the recipe to get the ratios right. And in an attempt to cut corners, I purchased pre-cut pastry circles for our puff dough pumpkin galette. Except it wasn't puff pastry -- it was regular pie dough. And it definitely didn't puff. I was back at the grocery store in the 11th hour.
Gargiulo said he tried to charge tuition once before, but enrollment dropped significantly. Now he said he has no choice.
"I had nothing to do with that," Smith said. "I really don't even like it. But it's become popular with kids. On any given night you can find at least two TV stations with it on. Those guys like to come back here and train with our guys. They're former All-Americans and national champs, and they wrestle. It keeps them involved somewhat in the sport, and (MMA) is a way they can actually make money in it."
And we're seeing more complex situations, problems like chemical dependency, mental illnesses and disabilities. We see we're serving a lot of people with multiple issues. So, while handing them a bag of groceries is great, we look at their situation holistically and try to find ways to help them in many areas of their lives to lift them up out of the crisis. Being small makes us flexible and creative.
"The cracking is not architectural, it's structural," Kucinich said. "FirstEnergy finally admitted this tonight. It's an issue of public trust. FirstEnergy did not give the public, media or us a true picture of what really happened at the start."
Gunson said that without the details of what happened with Fred Thompson’s father – he died of a heart attack when Fred Jr. was in ninth grade – it is difficult to know if a family history of heart trouble had anything to do with what killed Fred Jr.
In 1968, the world was different. As famed sociologist Harry Edwards said in that piece: "You had a country that was in turmoil. Against the background of a burgeoning civil rights movement and black power movement, it made sense to me that athletes had a role, and an obligation, to move the ball up the field."
Thirsty? - 20 stations will hand out 338,000 paper cups containing water and sports drink on the course.
This is right up there with Pitching will decide the playoffs or Football is won in the trenches." Yes. We know. Goaltending is very important. Rarely does a team advance with subpar goaltending. But rarely does a team get a 1993 Patrick Roy-esque performance in which one guy almost singlehandedly takes his team all the way.

We've just lifted off from Lake Tahoe Airport and are cruising over the casino strip on the Nevada-California border. Pilot Claudio Bellotto, owner of tour company HeliTahoe, points out Zephyr Cove and Cave Rock beyond. The four-place Raven II chopper is quieter and smoother than I had expected. It's more like a magic observation bubble than an aircraft.
Avocado flowers are usually perfect, meaning the trees have both male and female portions in the same blooms. Generally one tree can produce a good crop for home consumption. If you want to ensure the best fruiting you have to know the varieties and then match up one from each the A and B groups. Most gardeners simply take good care of their individual tree by feeding 3 to 4 times as year and keeping the soil moist during the dry times. Then after a few years they are normally rewarded with all the avocados they can eat.
"It's like I was lost in a sea of strangers. I should have felt comfortable considering I'd just been in a war. It's safe, it's college, the sun is shining and the weather is great. People are smiling, laughing, everybody's having a great time and I feel completely alone," he said.
Mayor Eldridge Hawkins Jr. has said the layoffs are necessary to close a roughly $3 million budget shortfall.
“It was a great game, somebody had to lose,” Caiazza said. “Both teams played really well, both pitchers settled down after the first three innings.”
One argument for the insurance mandate is that the fines are just federal taxes by another name. Another is that it falls under the government's constitutional power to regulate commerce that crosses state borders.
Like one of his burnished sculptures, Izquierdo's toughness was honed from his difficult childhood. Those experiences, friends and family say, affected the artist deeply. It also drew him closer to the city's small art community. Bunce, McLarty, Johanson and others were not simply teachers and peers, but another family. After graduating from the Museum Art School in 1951, Izquierdo taught there for 46 years, impacting generations of students.
Al-Hashemi is one of Iraq's highest-ranking Sunnis and is accused of running death squads that targeted Shiite officials and pilgrims. He denies the charges.
Isso's account, however, differed dramatically from Harris's account of the second beating. Harris testified last week that Naseem Shayota had a brick in his hand and used it to strike him in the face. Isso, who was standing very close to Harris when he was knocked down by Naseem, said there was no brick.
A long wait. Because of trades, including the deal to acquire quarterback Carson Palmer, the Oakland Raiders waited until the last pick of the third round — 95th overall — to make their first pick of the draft.
In “Gruesome Playground Injuries,” the characters’ injuries haven’t caused their failures, and yet they have allowed themselves to be defined by them. Despite its tragic tone and the difficulties of wardrobe and makeup changes, the drama is gripping and lingers in your mind.

He and his manager, Cheryl Allen, discuss the flavor ideas and decide how to balance the various ingredients. And then they just make a batch. "If it's a really odd flavor, we might remake it," Allen says, "but our hit rate is about 98%."
Records show that the watch is inscribed with the name Jerry Watkins, whom Davis sentenced to a two-year prison term in connection with an unrelated scheme that soaked investors for $20 million. While Watkins awaited sentencing in that scheme, the former Forest Lake resident was pitching Trevor Cook's fraudulent investment program on a Christian shortwave radio network. The FBI looked into Watkins' activities -- before Cook's Ponzi scheme imploded last summer -- but found nothing improper.

1978-79 - Cotton Fitzsimmons, Kansas City
"Mirror Mirror" works hard to let the audience know that it's aware of its own silliness. Although the story is set in a vaguely medieval fairy-tale kingdom - easier to conjure now, with digital effects - the tone is cheerfully, unapologetically anachronistic. The mean queen seems to have stepped out of one of the riper episodes of "Desperate Housewives," while practically every line in the picture is delivered like a sitcom zinger. (Was there really so much insult humor in the Middle Ages?) And the story has been altered to reflect more contemporary notions about the roles of men and women. Snow White is a much more can-do kind of princess than the passive heroine of yore, and this Prince Charming is quite a bit less masterful. He can't stop Snow from saving him, when he believes that he should be saving her. "It's been focus-grouped," he protests, to no avail.

Calling it his biggest win of the season against a team he believes has the potential to reach the NCAA Sweet 16, Turgeon joked that “I know it only counts as one, but it felt like three”. It was accomplished with two of Turgeon’s most basic tenets: tenacious defense and playing as a team.

The missing boy's parents would not answer other questions about Horman, Kyron's stepmother. Authorities say she was the last person to see him before he vanished June 4 from Skyline School.
At the risk of incurring Robert Mathis' ire -- and you don't want to do that, believe me -- this is not a whole lot better than an expansion team right now. And even if new general manager Ryan Grigson hits a home run the next two days of the draft, it's going to take time before Luck has a good team around him.
A convicted drug dealer has been identified as a "person of interest" in the killing of two Winter Park High School students whose bodies were found burning last month along a popular hiking and bicycling trail.
Take the Camry, the sensible grocery-getter. Despite its status as the best-selling car in North America, its design has long been the butt of jokes. Tokuo Fukuichi, who was named Toyota's chief designer last year, said the lackluster design was the product of a consensus-driven process that tried to please everybody and therefore excited no one.
Detroit City Councilman Kwame Kenyatta, who made clear his disgust with the consent agreement that gave the state power over Detroit's finances, won't seek another term, his office said Wednesday.

The girl's costume, on the other hand, must be one of a kind. "When you are a beginner, you wear a blouse and a skirt," Gina said. "But you wear the dress of your dancing school, so you all look alike. Now what I wear is called a 'solo' dress. It is often handmade, with whatever colors you want on it. It has to be a good length. If it is too short, you can be disqualified."

"If you see someone who has had to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, you know they're going to take the job more seriously and not complain about working hard," said attorney Pete Clancy, of Clancy & Diaz, LLP. "If I had to choose between someone who went to Yale who never worked and someone who went to (a local college), I'd probably go with the person who worked."
The Phillies just announced that Chase Utley, who missed spring training and a chunk of last season with a sore knee, is headed to see a specialist about the same problem and might miss the early part of 2012. Add that to the complications that have slowed Ryan Howard's recovery from Achilles surgery and the sports hernia that is hampering Placido Polanco and there's a pretty good chance that the Phillies' vaunted infield might not be back together until midseason.

Ten years after Sept. 11, many still approve of torture. For this we can thank people like Dick Cheney, who in his newly released book continues to justify the use of waterboarding and other torture methods; and former Justice Department official John Yoo, who in a Wall Street Journal op-ed just this week again wrote approvingly of the "tough interrogation" (read: torture) techniques he helped legitimize.

Not until late in the afternoon of the 24th did any of the other fishing vessels know one of their own had gone down.

The storyline involves the return of dragons to the land of Tamriel. And it’s a good thing they do, the appearance of the first dragon interrupts the player’s beheading by the local military.

“This was a zoning board issue, and they have to go before the zoning board and they were told about it back in January,” Puglia said. “It’s not zoned for what they want to do there.

Alfred Hitchcock capitalized on the bridge's allure -- and dramatically enriched its mythology -- when he staged a powerful scene in his 1958 thriller, "Vertigo," nearby. Kim Novak, playing the mysterious Madeleine, drops rose petals into the bay at Fort Point -- under the shadow of the giant bridge. Suddenly she jumps in and, in a sweeping gesture of movie-star heroism, Jimmy Stewart dives into the turbulent water and carries out the soaking Novak in his arms.

Among industry watchers there was some question whether "One Man, Two Guvnors," based on an 18th century Goldoni comedy, could qualify as a revival, but the show will instead be considered a new play as its London incarnation was during awards season in Blighty.

“One of the things we’re doing, and the reason Dr. Schlitt knew about this, is a development campaign called the 2012 Legacy Society,” said Katz. “Anyone who contributes $1,000 or more, between now and the end of the charter class’ first year, will become a member of the society and have his or her name on a display outside the dean’s office in our building.

I had been to Don's a few times in the 1990s, but then the Cleveland restaurant scene started to explode with creative, cutting-edge places that pushed the old stalwarts aside. When I returned recently, it was nice to see the old stalwart had managed to keep pace. The bar and dining room, which have undergone major face-lifts, exude a comforting-yet-sophisticated warmth. The menu, while still heavy on seafood, is far from the basic fish, lobster and steak I remembered. My wife and I started our first visit splitting a delightful bacon-shrimp appetizer and a spinach salad. Grilling bacon-wrapped shrimp so the bacon is crisp without torching the shrimp to a rubbery toughness is quite a trick, but the kitchen pulled it off. The salad featured a creative combination of candied pepitas, marinated dried cherries, grilled halloumi cheese and a warm pancetta vinaigrette. The firm cheese soaked up the grill-char flavor like a steak. Entrees -- Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast and a marlin special -- were good examples of Don's ability to turn out quality dishes at prices lower than many fine-dining spots. We enjoyed a generous serving of crab in our crab-cake appetizer during a weekday lunch visit. The cakes were as close to pure crab as you can get -- actual lumps, not the shredded stuff some restaurants pass off as lump crab meat. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer

To that end, the Blues practiced holding their scoring positions Friday. It's been a country home January for the Blues, who play nine of 11 games in front of a warm fire at Scottrade.

What does that mean? Are we less "global" than Los Angeles - of course not. Heck, having lived for a time in Los Angeles, I'm not convinced L.A. is even a city, global or otherwise, but a collection of disparate places - Hollywood, Beverly Hills, the beach, freeways - mashed together by an accident of geography.

Mr. Romney is now hoping that Ohioans forget his now-famous advice that we should "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt," which would have decimated the auto industry and the nearly 850,000 Ohioans whose livelihood depends on it. Romney even went a step further during his trip to Euclid this week, trying to take credit for President Obama's auto rescue, which he vehemently opposed. The truth is that if Mr. Romney's auto industry bankruptcy strategy had been followed, it would have been an absolute disaster for Ohio in general, and Northeast Ohio in particular.

4. Process/decision-making. Is the candidate comfortable making tough decisions? More importantly, does he understand how to create an environment where good decisions can be made?

(When queried by his first Treasury secretary about the size of his proposed tax cut, Mr. Bush responded, "I don't negotiate with myself.)

The Hatem Bridge over the Susquehanna River on Route 40 took in $12 million over the past three years. During this time, there has been a free decal renewal system in place that makes this an artificially low number to base any fiscal decision on. During that same period, $74 million was spent in maintaining the bridge. This number is artificially inflated, as the bridge was undergoing massive redecking. If properly amortized (let's say, $74 million once every 20 years), we are talking about a real maintenance cost of less than $12 million over that same three-year period. The fact that the MdTA has grossly manipulated the financial facts while making its argument suggests to me that they actually break even on the Hatem Bridge.
øToyota says the 2011, not the 2012, actually has more headroom. And the 2011 three-door, not the 2012, has slightly more passenger space. But the five-door does get a bit more passenger space for 2012. Cargo space grew, but by about 30%, not 68%.

I’m betting that the news yesterday that Arizona State linebacker Vontaze Burfict tested positive for marijuana at the NFL Scouting Combine was treated with little more than a shrug in the Ravens’ draft room. I can’t say for sure that Burfict, who some draft pundits once considered a potential first-round target of the Ravens, is not on the team’s board. However, I can say that I would be very surprised if he was, even if we’re talking the sixth or seventh rounds here. I think the Ravens have enough confidence in their coaching staff and locker room leadership to take a chance on a player with some character concerns and discipline issues. But as they say, the tape doesn’t lie, and Burfict’s scouting tape this past season was, by all accounts, extremely poor. Throw in the interviews he bombed at the combine – and the Ravens conducted one of them – and I’d have to think that he was off the Ravens’ board long before his latest mishap.
