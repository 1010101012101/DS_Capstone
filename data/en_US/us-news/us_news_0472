"Yes, I've seen your commercials on television, and I think I would not be averse to partaking of your services. You see, I'm new to the area, and am having trouble meeting that special person. I mean I think I'm quite a catch - I collect foreign beer bottle caps, have been to every Comic Con since 1989, and am president of the local chapter of the Quark-Lovers Anonymous Club. What would be the methodology of enrolling in your program, and thereby extricating myself from singlehood?"
One of the most enjoyable experiences for many sports fans is to spend time with a former player or coach and listen to war stories — particularly if the tales involve some of the lesser-publicized shenanigans that occurred off the court or playing field.
Arizona State's Trent Lockett, the team's leading scorer last season, says he will transfer to Marquette for his senior season to be closer to his mother, who has been diagnosed with cancer.
He was literally, in just about every aspect, the man I've dreamed of all my life. He valued his word to the utmost, as did I, and I believed in his word to the point that I mistakenly and unknowingly challenged it on the worst day possible: the anniversary of the loss of his only son to the Iraqi war.
"This week we take time to reflect on one of the world's most infamous disaster, the sinking of what was believed to be an unsinkable ship," Harford County Executive David Craig stated in a press release.

Added Giancarlo Stanton, who went 0 for 3 with three strikeouts, a walk and a fielding error during a three-run Mets' eighth: "It seems like lackadaisical on the field, and then when it's crunch time, pressing or whatever you want to say.

"Short and totally boring." You're in trouble if that's how you'd describe your last romantic encounter. But if you're talking about a hospital stay, those are four perfect words. The last thing you want is a nasty surprise . . . as in one of the 2 million annual cases of hospital-caused infections.
Eeek! Really? Well, let's see ... um ... writing lots of notes and folding them up real tiny. Being awesome at basketball for half of a season. Being lost the first day of ninth grade because the school was so big. Getting harassed by my older brother's friends. Hanging at the beach after school.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1 cup of the milk, the cornmeal, salt, pepper, sugar, water and butter.

In February the Maloof brothers, who own the Kings, and Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson reached a tentative deal for a new public and privately-funded $391-million arena in downtown. Last month The Times reported the Maloofs were raising doubts about promises by officials to have the new arena built by opening night of the 2015-16 NBA season.
Admittedly, some reviews are also positive to the point of glowing. But whether an online review is good, bad or somewhere in between, there's no knowing who posted it -- the establishment's owner, a scheming competitor looking to drive customers away or merely a random customer who just happens to love Triple-A Muffler Repair and felt the need to express that affection in a 10-paragraph ALL CAPS essay filled with exclamation points(!!!).

During his two terms in the White House in the '80s and as California's governor in the late '60s and early '70s, Reagan did all those things.
Teens could do a lot with some more respect, especially the kind that comes from adults. I sometimes wonder if the grown-ups consider my entire generation to be uncontrollable, nonstop party people who couldn't give two cents about what it takes to be a mature individual. I know that's not the case, and so does my English instructor. She's the only one thus far to even show concern for the well-being of our social skills, and I really do respect that. Maybe if more young adults acted more like, well, young adults, they would at least be treated as such. If we voiced our opinions and expressed our thoughts while assuming this respectable persona, perhaps there would be less "Oh, they're just kids, what do they know?" and more "Maybe they do know what they're talking about."
As for knowing about this league, I didn’t know about this league in France, but I did know there were European Football Leagues going on because I have a few friends playing in Europe.
Spring has sprung, and a young man's thoughts turn to love. Unfortunately, a middle-age man's thoughts turn to yard work, which he doesn't love. That's especially true in my case. The situation is so bad that I would put a "Keep Off the Grass" sign on my front lawn, but there isn't much grass to keep off.
More than any other municipality in New Jersey, Bob Feinberg felt his town deserved a film festival. So he built it one.
My dad always told us you are only as good as your word and I took the principal at his word. It has bothered me ever since then. I was 8 years old and he lied to me and that has left a scar on me all this time. Now I am 50 and it still brings tears to my eyes for the hurt that this has caused. I know 42 years later I should be over it, but there is still pain.
If not providence, it was at least convenient. Jerry Herrmann, Earth Crusaders executive director, organized the cleanup, which falls on the 101st birthday of the city, for the seventh year in a row.

That’s not the only thing I’ve been working on, of course. I’m also trying to develop an interior game … back cuts, flashes to the rim and facing up, 1-on-1. I’m really trying to open up my offensive arsenal. I’m working on all of this with coach Bill Bayno, one of our assistants famous for his work at UNLV. He’s still really athletic and still defends against us in 1-on-1 drills. He has these big pads he wears on his forearms and then we go one on one and he swings those things at us and smacks us like a crazy man. We work on that on the interior to make sure we work on finishing at the rim. They are pads, so it doesn’t hurt at all, but that doesn’t mean you don’t still feel the impact. We do a lot of things of this nature. It’s his work with Aldridge this year that has really paid off.

Akbar Ahmed, professor of Islamic studies at American University, found a wide range of mosques — from literalist to modernist to mystical — while researching his book, "Journey Into America, The Challenge of Islam."

The graceful lines of the tall ships that lined San Francisco's waterfront in those days captivated Holland. They were more than boats, he thought. They were works of art. When he was 10, he took on his first project — an 18-foot Malibu outrigger, a popular backyard project of the time that could be launched from the surf. It took two years to complete.

After their loss to Miami last night, the Nets fell to 22-40, tying them for the sixth-worst record with Toronto. Because teams who finish with the same record add, then divide, their combinations, if the season ended today, the Nets and Raptors would each have 53 combinations. So the Nets' odds of getting a top-three pick right now would be:

The Browns would see plenty more of Richardson's punishing, smash-mouth style if they draft him No. 4 in next Thursday's opening round of the NFL draft.

Google is acquiring Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a purchase largely geared to gain access to the company's trove of mobile and wireless patents. Microsoft spent more than $1 billion to buy nearly 1,000 patents from AOL. And Facebook announced plans Monday to purchase about 650 of Microsoft's newly acquired patents for $550 million. That's likely to provide ammunition in its legal battle with Yahoo, which filed a patent suit in March; Facebook responded with a countersuit several weeks later. It's one of dozens of patent cases now embroiling the online and mobile industries, as Apple, HTC, Kodak, Samsung, Motorola, LG and many others duke it out.
Brown's fines have been relatively small, reflecting the size of his tax bill (fines are set by statute). The condo is valued for tax purposes at $222,280, and Brown owed $922.04 in property taxes for the last half of 2011. The taxes were due by Sept. 26, according to the District property tax office. His delinquency added another $76.96 as a late penalty and $46.18 for interest.

The Bee reported on Sunday that Maj. Gen. William H. Wade II, who led the Guard from late 2005 through early 2010, boosted his salary by working hundreds of days on federal duty while being paid by both the federal and state governments.

“They didn’t give me a chance to explain. … We had another $50,000 donated and when the lady didn’t pay me, the camp had to cover me,” Petty said, “and they insinuated I was making irrational decisions. However, I had spoken to Wynonna, and she believed in Victory Junction and was going to donate half of her proceeds, which paid the other $50,000, and she was also going to do a concert in North Carolina for free.”
Even one of the architects of the system has complained bitterly that the new proposal has become a "train robbery" that diverts rail funds to local commuter lines. Many critics argue that the new business plan almost certainly violates the clear dictates in Prop. 1A – i.e., that the train move people quickly between South and North without requiring transfer.

The cathedral has also scaled down its "Hour of Power" broadcasts viewed by millions worldwide.
The Fat Doug ($8), for example, is so crammed with coleslaw and pastrami, it's almost impossible to get your chops around it. You'll need a knife, too, for Mr. Porky ($6), a grilled brat buried under shredded cheese, pulled pork and pickled jalapenos. The peppers, despite their welcome jolt, have the unappetizing effect of making the soft hot-dog bun soggy.

In Thailand, sangkaya fakthong -- literally, "custard pumpkin" -- is a traditional favorite. Coconut custard sweetened with palm sugar is poured into the pumpkin or other types of squash, such as kabocha, and then steamed. The essence of pandanus leaves, called bai dteuy, is often added to enhance the flavor and aroma of the coconut. It also provides a natural green coloring, which complements the pumpkin's orange hue.

At the middle school level, the one-to-one laptop model continued to expand into the eighth grade classrooms. Now every student in the West Deptford Middle School integrates technology literacy into their daily learning experiences. Academic extensions have been added to the sixth and seventh grade to reach at-risk learners in both literacy and mathematics. The gifted and talented program has been revised to integrate all core curriculum areas in an interdisciplinary approach in grades five through eight. Teachers throughout the middle school are utilizing the Moodle/EdModo On-Line Educational Platforms to provide a forum for students to work in an on-line environment while still receiving instruction in the classroom. And the Rachel’s Challenge Character Education Program was integrated at the middle school level to support extracurricular work and initiatives at the high school.
The best control is to hang one flour moth pheromone trap in the area they are infesting. This will attract and catch the male moths and stop the breeding process. Then inspect all open dried food and toss anything that is infested. Place all non-infested food in sealed containers or refrigerate them. Completely clean the pantry where the food is stored to get any larvae that may be crawling around. Then lightly dust the shelves with food-grade diatomaceous earth before putting the food back.

The owners have created a concept that is ripe for replication, but I've found that in most cases new locations siphon off some of the special attributes of the original location, which is the case here. Even though the food on our recent revisit was good -- good enough to justify the always- crowded dining room -- discerning customers can probably tell that the owners have shifted their attention elsewhere. We saw evidence in the chipped salt and pepper dish on our table, in the way the waiter tossed bread plates in front of us, and most importantly, in what appeared on the plate. The breading on the fried trout ($13.25) was just a little bit too salty; the string beans with shallots, lemon and olive oil ($4) were removed from the pot a few minutes too soon so they were more raw than crunchy; and the broth on the always-wonderful "pot on fire" ($15.25), chunks of slowly simmered beef brisket surrounded by hunks of carrots, onions, turnips and leeks, had lost a bit of its intensity. Fortunately, it's easy to sweep away the blahs with the coarse salt, cornichons and mustard that accompany the latter.

Ballarotto argued that the saw had been brand new and was still in its cardboard casing before investigators tested it on animal bones to gauge whether the saw marks it made were similar to the ones found on Giordano’s remains. That testing destroyed microscopic evidence of a plastic filming that would have proved the blade had been unused when it was seized, Ballarotto argued on appeal.
That opened everything up for KU: A couple easy layups for Robinson and a kick-out to Elijah Johnson for a three-pointer were part of a 13-4 run to open the half. It tied the game at 38 and set up for a nip-and-tuck finish between these No. 2 seeds, each of which took at least a share of their conference regular-season title and were in the hunt for top seeding all the way up to Selection Sunday.

The most remarkable thing about the first two DVDs is the studio and rehearsal footage, some shot at Springsteen’s Holmdel home, where the band assembled daily to work through material. Springsteen stands in front of a microphone, shirtless and skinny, his eyes — under a pile of unruly hair — communicating intense concentration. E Streeters surround him, sometimes looking bored, but never missing a beat. Nobody mugs for the camera; nobody even seems to give much thought to it being there.

"With famous costumes, instruments and handwritten lyrics spread across two floors at the Cleveland museum, 'Women Who Rock' is perhaps more comprehensive than one might imagine. The exhibit begins with 1920s blueswomen Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith and spans all the way to current chart-toppers like Rihanna and Taylor Swift, with plenty of room for '70s rock chicks, classic country pickers, soul queens and Riot Grrrls along the way" -- Jillian Mapes, Billboard

In 2007, Congress called for a nationwide effort to achieve zero net energy use in all new commercial buildings by 2030, with the aim of getting similar results in all existing commercial structures by 2050. That's a tall order, with 81 billion square feet of commercial floor space nationwide, according to Energy Department estimates.
Tender, full-flavored beef, ripe Roquefort melting on top, a scoop of garlic mashed potatoes and a small handful of tender-crisp green beans made ooh la la from beginning to end. Ditto for the pork dish, which was fork-tender and elevated by a crush of fresh thyme and other herbs.

The poor need more than a thin safety net and they need more than the false dream of a job somewhere down the line when the tax breaks of the rich trickle down to their level. They need a president intensely engaged in breaking the cycle of poverty, poor education, fractured families and criminal activity that has created a permanent American underclass.
What country are we in? The movie never tells us. (It was filmed in Indonesia.) Establishing Rama as a Muslim seems pointless, except as a cheap fakeout in character development. No one in the film has a personality; they are all ruthless fighters without a brain in their heads. Is the lieutenant up to something? What? And why?

Competition for labor's backing for such a bid might be fierce: In 2009, labor's political organ, the Working Families Party, endorsed several possible 2013 mayoral wannabes, including City Council Speaker Chris Quinn, ex-Comptroller Bill Thompson, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer. (Like Liu, de Blasio has worked overtime to appease labor.)

On another subject, Anderson said the city's delayed Town Center revitalization plan is "still a priority." The $20 million plan, adopted in 2006, proposes to make one-way sections of Del Prado Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway two-way streets and create a pedestrian-friendly residential and business area. Construction has yet to begin because of sharp declines in tax revenue after the recession began in 2008.

If a pair of reporters with no greater access to property tax data than members of the general public can uncover so many millions in lost tax revenue, there's no reason every local government in the state shouldn't be doing the same. Clearly, such a project would pay for itself in no time, and elected officials might discover that cracking down on assessments is a whole lot more popular with voters that broad-based tax increases when it comes time to cover budget shortfalls, state or local.
Then after a reception at Buckingham Palace, he took his new wife for a spin, driving a dark-blue Aston Martin Volante festooned with ribbons, bows and balloons — and a license plate that read "JU5T WED."
This led to Darren Criss, a founding member (and their Harry), getting cast on "Glee" and becoming a star. It also led to more StarKid productions, including "A Very Potter Sequel" in 2010. Which led to most of Team StarKid settling on Chicago as a home base, working on even more shows and developing a consistent and clever, wide-eyed, pop-culture-scrounging musical theater sensibility. Which led to the self-produced soundtrack for its most recent musical, "Starship," going to No. 1 on the iTunes music charts. Which now has led to a sold-out concert tour featuring the same songs, starting Friday in Ann Arbor. (The Tuesday show at the Bottom Lounge is sold out.)

Frenchtown, like some other municipalities, collects sewer fees based on the concept of a “rental unit.” Single-family homes are charged as one rental unit, while two-family homes are charged as two rental units, and so on. Restaurants are charged as a certain amount of rental units based on seating capacity, and other types of businesses are charged based on another formula.
Collinsville Superintendent Dennis Craft, who is retiring at the end of June, is among those who want the board to slow down and have a strategic planning session to determine what projects, if any, are district priorities. Several school districts that have added artificial turf have engaged in such a process.
And they didn't have to come in the 1-0, Game 5 loss that plunged Phillies fans into a baseball version of nuclear winter. People in the earth's northern climates - the Arctic Circle regions of Finnish and Swedish Lapland, sub-Arctic Russia and Alaska, Canada's far Northwest Territory and vast regions north of Baffin Bay - suffer from sunlight deprivation during their winters of short or no daylight. It is called Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD.
"Irrepressible" begins with the rogue Mitford at age 12 opening her own bank account, the necessary groundwork for escape. That came in 1937, when, at 19, she met her second cousin Esmond Romilly, the dashing, precocious nephew of Winston Churchill, who shared her radical politics. To her family's horror and the newspapers' delight, the two fled to join anti-fascist forces in the Spanish Civil War. Though very much devoted to her family, Mitford was often estranged from them, this being one of the most extreme ruptures.

She dismissed the idea that her domestic partnership with Stier is enough. She also recounted going to the Alameda County clerk's office last May in an attempt to get a marriage license, only to get turned away by a "nervous" supervisor who told the couple Proposition 8 prevented them from marrying. "There's something so humiliating about everybody knowing you want to make some decision, and you don't get to," she testified.

However, it's not unusual for "white hot" to land in an ice bath. There's no one reason, but the kind of attraction you shared with her is particularly vulnerable. Instant wow + one month together = superficial attraction. One stupid remark, one bad outfit, one bad makeout session, one bad whatever and bam, water meets flame. Falling for someone over time creates a far more durable (and forgiving) heat.
In the semifinal win over McKee/Staten Island Tech, Richmond had 10 of his team’s 20 points in the fourth quarter and in the finals rout of St. Peter’s, he poured in 18 of his 23 points after halftime.
Recent "discoveries" of chocolate's cardiovascular benefits and stimulation of endorphin and dopamine isn't exactly a news flash for those familiar with its history. Xocóatl was used to treat stomach ailments, fatigue, fever, kidney stones and impotence. Its marvelous properties made cacao a precious commodity. Maya plantation lords traded beans for feathers, jade and other coveted goods. Four beans could buy you a rabbit; 12 would get you an evening with a prostitute. Some Maya villages used cacao beans as currency well into the 19th century.

Director/co-writer Whedon, the mind behind TV’s “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the cult sci-fi series “Firefly,” revels in the comic bookyness of it all. Although this (badly converted 3-D) film delivers most of what it promises with the notable exception of a memorable villain (Tom Hiddleston’s Loki remains a lip-snarling accretion of hair extensions, caribou antlers and bondage gear), watching it at the screening was like staring into a black hole for 142 minutes. Help me, Obi-Wan.
"This was a kind of bare-knuckled thing," said Dave Barrows, who lobbied for OU Foundation. "This was not a minuet where we were dancing around. We took it outside the bar into the parking lot."
Petrino was taken to a Fayetteville intersection by another passer-by. There, Dorrell left in her car. Petrino, 51, was met by Capt. Lance King, his security guard.
Truth is, I'd never heard of Thorne-Thomsen before dining at Story. But my oversight matters less than the fact that this self-trained entrepreneur is one of an emerging second wave of chefs worth keeping an eye on as they step out of the shadows to write the next chapter in Kansas City dining.

NASCAR President Mike Helton defended the inspectors who ruled that Jimmie Johnson's car violated the rules at Daytona even though an appellate officer this week reversed most of the penalties NASCAR levied against Johnson and his Hendrick Motorsports team.
The anarchist was Leon Czolgosz, child of Polish immigrants. In May 1901, he journeyed from the family farm in Ohio to Cleveland to hear a speech by anarchist firebrand Emma Goldman - "Red Emma." The speech hit a nerve in Czolgosz, who judged McKinley to be a tool of the rich and an empire builder. Six months later, at an exposition in Buffalo, N.Y., Czolgosz fatally wounded the president.
The San Diego County Employees Retirement Association says Baker had nothing to blow the whistle about, as the agency always complied with its risk policies and any volatility was disclosed to the pension board in public.
In my eyes, Vos represents the worst kind of politician. He tells the voters what they want to hear instead of what they need to hear. His rhetoric is easy to listen to, but does nothing to help solve the real problems facing the township. Don’t be seduced by Herman Vos’ simplistic diatribe. Vos’ statements on how to streamline the operation of our township are so simplistic that Vos is either purposefully trying to deceive us or he is hopelessly naive about the operation of the town. In either case he does not deserve our vote for mayor.
2. Place beets in a large saucepan. Add enough water to cover by at least 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer.

INDIANAPOLIS — Tom Coughlin gave his opening remarks at today’s press conference and then turned the floor over to questions.
But the uptick in late payments during the fourth quarter, and an increase in the average balance to $5,204, from $4,965 a year prior, indicates a return to seasonal patterns seen before the recession. Holiday spending leads some card holders to put off paying their bills. If the seasonal patterns continue, the late payment rate will fall as individuals receive tax refunds and use that money to bring their accounts current.
It wasn’t as though he was waiting by the phone, but every time we talked to him over those years, he always mentioned that he’d love to get back into the NBA. It took the Blazers, who he played seven seasons for, to make that happen, two years ago, when Buck was hired as an assistant on Nate McMillan’s staff. Nate’s gone, but Buck’s still there.

However, CPS' own records undermine the story about the injuries because they show that Lilly had not been in her biological mother's care for about 10 years. In fact, Lillian Horvath-Manning took the children for several years to live in Texas, where documents show the family had at least two more CPS cases.
“This steroid abuse is frightening from both a public policy and public health perspective,” said Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Camden. “Taxpayers have been stung and public safety has been put at risk, as has the health of the abusers. We cannot sit idly by and let this abuse continue. This bill is a step in the proper direction.”
The decision-makers can take the easy way out on this and use the money for more private flights and fancier parties, or they can actually use it for something that's in everyone's best interests.
Some fellow critics lashed back. The Los Angeles Times' Christopher Knight, in a lengthy 1991 critique, called Kramer "the Little Dutch Boy of art criticism," whose writings were futile efforts to hold back the tide of "Pop artists, Minimalists, Conceptualists and other horrid children of the 1960s." A few years later, critic Peter Plagens wrote in Newsweek that Kramer was the critic the art world reads "like crazy, even if it's by flashlight, under the blankets."
That's true of Mary Garrick, 27, an advertising executive in Columbus, Ohio. She and her husband, David, married in 2008 and hoped to start having children quickly, in part because men in his family have died in their 40s.

“Given that Santorum personally opposes birth control, wants to put doctors who perform abortions in prison, and wants to recriminalize sodomy laws to take on gay people, it sounds like he lives in the 1940s and not New York in the 21st century,’’ said one of the state’s most prominent Republicans.
“It doesn’t surprise me. It’s interesting,” Saunders said of Garnett’s positional switch. “I told KG when he came in the league at 19 that we were going to make him a small forward, but that he would become an all-pro player as a power forward and that he would finish his career as a center.

Vogel's postgame message to the players wasn't so much about what they accomplished in this series, a series in which -- let's be honest -- they were fortunate to get the Magic without Dwight Howard.

How will it work? Residents will toss unwanted food -- coffee grounds, bones, rotten vegetables, uneaten meat and even discarded pizza boxes -- into the green carts now used only for yard waste. Haulers will increase pickups to once a week from every other. The good news? Residents can still throw yard waste in with food scraps, and the city will give all residents kitchen pails to collect scraps.

That thorny issue eventually faded from view and new takes on the question of cosmic life emerged, such as whether there were canals on Mars. Arguably, the first organized SETI took place in the 1920s when astronomer David Todd persuaded the U.S. military to observe radio silence across North America while he and others listened to the Red Planet. More famously, pioneering radio astronomer Frank Drake turned a big dish in West Virginia toward the stars in 1960. SETI has continued, in fits and starts, ever since.

Lakers-Denver: Amid the sea of cheap shots and adolescent behavior, Kobe Bryant desperately tries to hold this team together. He made a statement for team unity when he sat out the regular-season finale and bypassed a chance to win the scoring title. Make no mistake, this team will implode, with Andrew Bynum at the center of things, but it won't happen this early. As much as I'd love to see Ty Lawson, Danilo Gallinari, Kenneth Faried and coach George Karl move on, I don't think Kobe lets it happen. Lakers in six.

In every savings plan, there should be a part that is conservative and safe from unforeseen problems. What can be more safe and conservative than debt-reduction of the home you need to live in? Getting to mortgage-free by retirement should be a major goal -- the sooner the better. In these days of limited job security, having a small mortgage (or better, no mortgage) can be a real benefit in a period of joblessness. It's very understandable that financial advisors would advise against this -- dollars put toward paying off the mortgage are not available for them to "manage."

Says Mr. McClendon, "I get mad at the New York-based environmentalists because if you were truly environmentalists you wouldn't have a storm surge system and a sanitary system hooked together here that requires you to close your beaches 10 times a year. You'd hire an army of people to pick up plastic bottles off the street and newspapers off the street and it wouldn't all go into the rivers. But you know, these are people who have a great deal of influence with the president and I think he had lost some of their confidence and he needed to do something to deliver a victory for environmentalists."
An early plan for how to do that is due in about a month.

The subject of earmarks has over the years brought criticism of Congress that's often generated by wasteful earmarks such as the $200-million-plus "bridge to nowhere" in Alaska that was supposed to connect an island with a population of just 50 or so to the mainland. But among congressional watchdogs the more odious element has been the pay-to-play culture in which campaign cash flows from earmark beneficiaries into the coffers of lawmakers.
There's too many to pick just one. One day that I'll never forget is in May 2009; that morning we all got word that our good friend Howie had passed away, and that night the Timbers played Rochester Rhinos. It was an extremely trying day, surreal to be in the stadium among all my friends but knowing Howie, a great guy with whom I'd watched dozens of games and been on multiple road trips, including overseas, was gone.

I then mentioned it annoys me when you're at a store checking out and the clerk asks for your phone number. I always tell them I don't give out my personal information. That's when my other friend at dinner chimed in. She thinks I am being rude because the company makes them ask for phone numbers. I told her she should be mad at the company, not me. I don't feel obligated to give out my phone number. Some say I should give a fake number. That's beside the point. I want them to know I am not giving out my personal information.
Romney is working on plans to raze the 3,000-square-foot seaside home he purchased for $12 million and replace it with an 11,000-square-foot structure. Among the planned amenities of his La Jolla manse are a 3,600-square foot basement and a separate elevator for his automobiles.
This will excite activists of the left and the right. It will be less thrilling for already-jaundiced independent voters in the middle, who spend a lot less time thinking about the virtues and demerits of, say, Justice Antonin Scalia than do the ideologues. And it surely isn't great for the Supreme Court itself.
Balderdash. Which is what I’d say if I ever actually used that stupid word.

The catch - You can file an appeal in civil court, arguing that police unfairly targeted you, or that you tried to provide a sample. A judge quickly issues an order granting you the right to drive as long as the case is pending. The county prosecutor becomes the lawyer for the Department of Revenue and, theoretically, prepares a case to prove the police were right.
Or much of anything else.
Centuries-old temples are an integral part of the Bhutan landscape, and each one I visited offered an experience that didn't fit a typical itinerary. Inside a dark passage of the Temple of Good Message, or Tamshing Lhaking, near Bumthang, Tshering picked up a heavy chain-mail coat he said was made more than 600 years ago by the revered Buddhist saint Pema Lingpa.

I was a fan of the grilled artichoke appetizer ($10), an artichoke and a half with the leaves snipped and the bottom of the stem cut off, the whole thing sliced vertically and roasted on a hot grill. Some of the leaves and interior were seared almost to blackness, but with no burnt flavor. Instead, the artichoke had smoky aromas and smoky background flavors, with most of the flavor coming from the artichoke itself, seasoned liberally with salt and pepper.

Baltimore Racing Development was beset by financial difficulties long before the race. The leadership team failed to secure a title sponsor to contribute more than $1 million dollars in exchange for naming rights.

Instead, the leafy green is the filling for spanakopita, a Greek spinach pie made with layers of phyllo dough, or it is added to rice casseroles such as this chicken and spinach casserole.

Braised rabbit ($21) was swathed in a tangy sauce of honey, brown sugar and balsamic vinegar, flecked with caramelized onions and nipped with juniper berry. Pork loin ($20) got a multi-culti makeover when stuffed with prosciutto, apples, plums and -- surprise! -- sauerkraut. Sadly, both these meats were overcooked the night I tried them, which diminished the pleasure of the savvy layers of flavor that surrounded them.

And just as quickly as the caucus began to regain the prominence it enjoyed in the 1970s and 1980s, a question was formed: Will the group stay loyal to the Democratic Party or define its own interests as an outside entity. The answer threatens to splinter the group and maybe dilute that influence.

Young adults run from preachers like Brother Jed and Brother Micah, but that does not mean they do not have a desire to discover God. They see through preachers who speak only of God's judgment but not of God's grace. They grow weary of a theology that condemns women, homosexuals and just about everyone else. They want to engage in thoughtful discussions, meaningful mission and life-giving fellowship. They long to hear the stories of Christ.

Defensive coordinator Perry Fewell. People had issues with his schemes on the Pats’ two touchdown drives. I even had a guy anticipating my defending Fewell against the masses after the second TD.

He didn’t panic and kept calling his game, which was to cover more than pressure. It was a good plan, and it worked out tremendously.
