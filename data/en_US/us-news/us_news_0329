That’s a lot of pork running — or more accurately, shuffling — around, destined for a dizzying array of dishes. Bacon. Ribs. Pulled pork. Pork chops. Pork tenderloin. Tacos al pastor. Adobo pork. Pernil, the roasted pork shoulder.

Instead of simply turning the shuttles into tools for generating cash for the facilities lucky enough to have landed them (so they could show them off to foreign visitors like some sort of circus freak show), NASA could have thanked the people who provided support throughout the entire history of the U.S. space program.

I'm not immune to such feeding frenzies. I was in San Diego with the media mob last month, interviewing passengers from the crippled cruise ship as if they were akin to survivors of the Titanic. But at least it was a real overblown story. There was a real ship and a real emergency at sea. The airport security frenzy was an overblown virtual story.

Patriot bits: This was the second year in a row the Patriots earned the No. 1 AFC playoff seed and the fourth time in the past nine seasons ...

New England's defense ended the regular season ranked 31st in total yards. That would be the lowest-ranked defense ever to appear in a Super Bowl. The Patriots were 15th in scoring defense.

A tip for those who observe a seizure in progress: Put something soft under the patient's head. Remove eyeglasses. Loosen ties and collars. Don't try to forcibly stop the jerking movements. Don't pry open the person's mouth to prevent swallowing of the tongue. That never happens. Time the seizure. It's usually over in two minutes. If it lasts longer than five minutes, medical help should be summoned. When the seizure stops, turn the patient on his side in case he should vomit.

At O'Fallon high school, Kyle Stanton developed a knack for driving in runs. At Illinois State, he has not missed a beat.
Hudson, by contrast, opened the song a capella, and proceeded with little more than piano accompaniment. Her version of “I Will Always Love You” was the most apparent moment of tribute at an awards show that often seemed to be shadowed by Houston’s death. At times, it seemed that the Grammys were running from the memory of Whitney Houston. LL Cool J opened the show with a quick memorial prayer; that dispensed with, the Grammys charged on to the first performance. A heavily rumored tribute performance by Chaka Khan never materialized.

"The most valuable player is the guy making the inbounds. If the ball doesn't go where it's supposed to go, the play is going to be dead. We actually had a future pro baseball player, Jamie Sykes, who threw the inbounds. Pure luck to have a baseball player playing basketball, just when you need him. But luck is a key element as well.

Please don't let egos and small thinkers destroy all the good that this event has brought to our city. Any time there is a big risk taken, there will be unforeseen kinks to work out. Certainly with such a huge undertaking, money issues were to be expected until it gets established. Please give it a chance, be patient, and let it happen.

We physicians are not a trade union ("Got a better plan for reducing Medicare costs?" April 5). We have a monopoly on an essential service. As such, we are not permitted to unionize without violating antitrust laws. However, medical practice is voluntary. If pay does not cover costs, especially of massive student loan payback and practice startup costs, there will be less and less access to care. Marylanders should contact their legislators about real tort reform if they expect any reduction in their Medicare costs, as elderly patients and their families expect prompt diagnosis, timely treatment and excellent outcomes regardless of age or prior severe illness. They may sue if there is a bad outcome. There should be a federal award cap for care rendered under Medicare because it is a government program just like veteran care and the Indian health service, where lawsuits are limited.

As for the issue of legislators not knowing how things work, either we've made the system too complex, or we are sending the wrong people to Columbus. If eight years really isn't enough time to learn the rules and get some things done, then we need to reform how the Statehouse works. A child who cannot read, write or do math will enter and exit elementary and middle school knowing algebra and chemistry in eight years.
We need uniform regulation of this burgeoning industry rather than whatever patchwork of local monitoring is in place.
Last semester, 20 cases of cheating were reported to the Piedmont administration, ranging from plagiarism to forgery. The numbers fluctuate yearly, Kitchens said.

Not, maybe, if you’re actual royalty. If you’re the king of Morocco or Jordan, descended from the Prophet Muhammad; or the emperor of Japan, descended from the sun; or the queen of England, whose family has the Tower of London, enough crown jewels to sink an offshore island and a world-record number of People magazine covers, you might be all right.

Hey, Tony: What do you find more ironic and comment on both? The fact that Atlanta sent us a bounty of picks for the one receiver that would make their offense elite and get them to the Super Bowl and then they went out and scored zero offensive points in the playoffs. Or, the fact that the Browns, who are in desperate need of any playmakers, finally get one good enough to make the cover of Madden and we only can possibly keep him two years and then he walks? -- Nathan Cornell, Minneapolis

The public also understands that the death penalty requires far more resources than a case in which a penalty of life in prison without parole is sought. Those resources could be used to fight crime or make prisons safer for officers and inmates.

'A great underdog'
"Every birthday candle that ever got blown out / Is one more year of someone trying to figure it all out," sings Matthew Caws ("Looking Through") on Nada Surf's seventh album, released near the band's 20th anniversary. The astrology of "Astronomy," though, can be read a couple of different ways. While no longer widely "Popular," Nada Surf is one of the most dependable modern purveyors of power-pop; in that sense, this album is another rock-solid collection of tuneful, optimistic songs with more hooks than a tackle box on a Saturday morning. It's also an album of reflection, which frequently shows up the trio as being quite comfy on those laurels and not exactly pushing themselves. It's power-pop's law of motion: For every undeniably irresistible melody, you can't help thinking you've heard it before.

But for many parents, the issue isn't a passing fashion fad. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, young black men die at a rate nearly 1.5 times that of young Latinos and white men, and almost three times the rate of young Asian men. Figures from the U.S. Justice Department in 2010 showed that homicide was the leading cause of death for young black men ages 10 to 24 and the second leading cause of death for black women ages 15 to 24. And while parents and mentors don't want to instill paranoia, they want their kids to be alert to the signals that certain clothing and actions may convey.

Grann expertly juggles narratives, including the story of a famous, ill-fated 1996 mission to retrace Fawcett's steps; the history of exploration in the Amazon; and Fawcett's own venture toward Z.

Grann combines narrative and primary documents for a breathtaking clarity of scene and immediacy; any writer who can breathe life into letters written by scientists in the early 1900s deserves more than a hat tip.

7. Hunter Mahan, United States -- After one more week off, Mahan will continue what is shaping up as a career year when he plays in the Wells Fargo Championship. The only two-time winner on the PGA Tour this season, he has finished in the top 25 in seven of his eight events in 2012, missing only when he tied for 42nd in the Arnold Palmer Invitational. … Mahan said he took a new approach to playing in the majors when he backed off a bit on the intensity and tried to be more relaxed during the Masters. It seemed to work, for three rounds at least, and he was right in the mix before closing with a 2-over-par 74 that left him in a tie for 12th. However, it was much better than his missed cuts last year in the Masters, U.S. Open and the Open Championship before he tied for 19th in the PGA Championship. And he has proved that he can win against the strongest fields with titles in the 2010 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship earlier this year, so his best in the majors could be yet to come. … Mahan told reporters at Augusta National that he still gets roasted by fans from time to time on Twitter for his chunked chip shot that led to him conceding the deciding match of the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor to Graeme McDowell. He took that defeat hard but has gotten past it and is looking forward to getting a chance at redemption when the Ryder Cup is played again in September at Medinah.

Frankly, the whole idea of constellations has always befuddled me. I've looked at the famous star configurations and what they're supposed to visually symbolize, and even though I'm capable of abstract thinking, I simply don't get it. The Big and Little Dippers are pretty obvious, but for anybody to look at some loosely grouped stars and identify them as an archer or a lion or a water bearer must take a lot of imagination.

Horrified by his implication that a woman's life ought to be only devoted to motherhood and its value relegated to a biological function, I told him that I plan to keep focusing on trying to make my life count for something more than myself, and that maybe someday when I'm well into my old age, I'll pay lip service to societal pressures and adopt a child soldier, preferably one who grew up in the jungles of Colombia serving with the FARC, who I then wouldn't have to train to choke fools who make such idiotic remarks.

Halophytes' ability to take root in places conventional plants can't go means there shouldn't be such food-fuel conflicts.

What is impressive even now about "The Image" is its sweep. There is nothing timid about it. It is epic social history in which Boorstin hoped to provide a unified field theory of cultural decline.

Whether we share his anger or not, we all know we live in a world of images, a world where everything seems planned for effect rather than substance, and Boorstin no doubt would have had a field day dissecting "reality" shows that have nothing to do with reality beyond the description. They are practically designed to the specifications of Boorstin's thesis.
