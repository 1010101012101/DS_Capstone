Unlike a foreclosure, which is an action against a homeowner by a lender, a short sale is a creditor's decision to take a loss on an investment. For a seller, a short sale means a lower credit score - similar to the damage caused by a foreclosure - but no lengthy court process. Some people who go through a short sale instead of a foreclosure may have an easier time buying another house and finding a mortgage in the future.

A lot is made of the Saints passing attack, and rightfully so — Drew Brees has an arsenal of weapons and uses them all well. Entering Week 12, Drew Brees led the NFL in passing yards (3,326), was tied for second in passing touchdowns (23) and was third in quarterback rating (101.3) But the Saints’ x-factor is their run game. In the team’s three losses — against the Packers, Buccaneers, and Rams — the Saints didn’t establish an effective ground attack and didn’t reach the century mark in rushing in each loss, averaging just 69 rushing yards in the three games. The only other time the Saints failed to rush for 100 yards was in their overtime victory against the Falcons two weeks ago when they ran for just 41 yards. The Saints average over 138 rushing yards in their seven victories.

If you're brave enough to give that special someone a beautifying product, you might be intrigued by the Baby Quasar, a hand-held LED device that supposedly uses red, amber and infrared light to rejuvenate the skin. (Sure enough, the young woman in the SkyMall ad doesn't seem to have a single wrinkle.) The company website instructs users to press the device against each of six zones of the face for two minutes at a time. After each zone is covered, users are supposed to repeat the process. The site recommends completing this routine every other day. The Baby Quasar costs about $400.
Certain products are also harder to track simply because of how they are grown and processed for larger companies. Tomatoes, for example, are picked before they're fully ripe then brought to packing centers from different farms. There, sorters pick the ones that ripen at the same time and package them together, mixing tomatoes from different farms before shipping them on to the next point in the chain.

“He’s regarded as a fool, I suppose, but he’s a rather sad character,” Hopkins says. “He has that male obsession with mortality — I suppose it’s an extension of Woody Allen’s famous credo, ‘We’re all going to die, I just don’t want to be there when it happens!’

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has authority to review Sheriff's Department records, and because the jails commission was created by and appointed by the board, it serves as the board's proxy, so it should enjoy similar access. The seven-member panel has made it clear that it isn't interested in singling out individual deputies for punishment. Rather, its goal is to identify systemic flaws and recommend ways to fix them. The commission can't be expected to fulfill that goal, however, if records such as inmate complaints about excessive use of force or department databases that track deputies and the accusations against them are deemed off-limits.

Such an outcome for Corzine may not satisfy an outraged public, Walden acknowledged. But, he added, "We’re in for quite a long probing."
But the lack of reforms and the plentiful handouts, analysts said, reflected political efforts to widen support ahead of national elections, which are less than two years away.
This is a guy who scored 52 touchdowns in high school. He ran 10.33 in the 100 meters and long jumped 21 feet, 8 inches. Such a ridiculous-good athlete that USC, Auburn and LSU wanted him in the huddle. And so forgive me today, but when I heard that Seastrunk was transferring I hoped the report was a hoax.

Corp won't go nearly as high in next week's draft as Barkley, the presumptive No. 1 overall pick in 2013, will next April. But he's an intriguing prospect with plenty of upside who could appeal to a team like the Lions searching for a developmental quarterback late in the draft.

It isn't, of course, and that means taxpayers will be digging even deeper to keep the Rams. The team has already rejected a plan that would include $60 million in public money for a new scoreboard, more club seating and better lighting, and there's no doubt the final tab will be much more.

-- For taxpayers claiming income-tax deductions based on their property taxes, remember that federal and Michigan income tax returns seek details on property taxes paid in different time frames. On their federal return, taxpayers should specify the amounts paid for winter 2009 and summer 2010 property-tax bills. Michigan state forms, on the other hand, call for taxpayers to list amounts owed for their summer 2010 and winter 2010 property billings.

Until fairly recently, that would've been my own blushing response. For five years I lived in Mexico City and worked in an office near a beautiful, leafy street named for Rubén Darío, the great Nicaraguan journalist, cultural diplomat and poet. Darío's admiration for the French Symbolists, along with his wariness toward the geopolitical adventurism of Uncle Sam, propelled him, almost single-handedly, to haul Latin American verse into the 20th century under the battle flag of the "Modernismo" movement.

She had suspected her husband was seeing another woman in the summer of 2010. It quickly became evident, she said, that woman was Andrea Sneiderman, who has denied, under oath, that she was romantically involved with Hemy Neuman.

Another fundamental flaw in the Cascade study is its attempt to suggest that our pseudoephedrine law did nothing to reduce meth use. Our law was not designed to address meth use; it was about domestic meth manufacturing. Most meth comes from Mexico, which has banned pseudoephedrine entirely and forced the drug cartels to switch to methods of manufacture without pseudoephedrine, a more difficult process that results in weaker meth.

Though middle-of-the-road female voters tend to be more concerned than conservative women about maintaining the nation's social safety net and expanding healthcare access, Romney has vowed to repeal Obama's healthcare law, rein in the growth of programs like Medicare and get rid of government aid to Planned Parenthood. He rarely touts his own efforts to expand access to healthcare in Massachusetts, because the program has become such a liability for him among Republican voters.

Members of the defense pointed to the second half, when the unit was considerably better, as evidence of playing their way into the game. But, of course, the Packers went into shutdown mode after the Urlacher interception and didn't seem too worried about what the Bears could do with Collins. Caleb Hanie came in and led two touchdown drives sandwiched around a pick-six to 337-pound defensive lineman B.J. Raji.

My sense is that we have only a fragment. Perhaps Wallace was going for something truly massive, with an even larger scope than the 1,000-page plus "Infinite Jest." What we get in this book is just the arrival of young Wallace and other recent hires (GS-9s) at the tax-processing center (REC) in Peoria, Ill., and 500-plus pages in, we await the entrance of the group's genius leader, Dr. Merrill Errol Lehrl.
Runaway Pentagon spending exacts a very high price on our economy. It is no exaggeration to say that excessive military spending is starving state and city budgets, costing us millions of jobs and perpetuating the recession for many Americans. Dollar for dollar, money invested in weapons produces fewer jobs than money invested in education, green jobs, or a myriad of other industries, according to a study by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
His failure has exemplified the frustration of the Bears' offense under Mike Martz - there's always something. Hanie has been so inefficient that every mistake hurts, whether it's overthrowing a wide-open Earl Bennett against the Kansas City Chiefs and a wide-open Barber against the Broncos, or Barber committing a penalty to nullify a touchdown pass, or Roy Williams bobbling a pass at the goal line to turn a touchdown into an interception.

Oh sure, I understand our financial crisis and the supposed fiduciary responsibility of the council but just how far do we, the electorate, allow this to go? I guess President Obama could say that the financial crisis is still overwhelming and suspend any upcoming vote for office. After all, the cost of an election is expensive and the considerable amount of time and money spent on running for office could be considered a waste. Consider what could have been done with the $80 million that Meg Whitman spent just on running for office. Now add in the money spent on all the other elections. In truth, President Bush could have used the same reasoning, but I am glad he did not. I believe that is the way that dictators or "Presidents for life" do it. Some still accuse FDR for having come close to that in that he had four terms in office and had a bit of a financial situation of his own.

Devil in a blue dress: Danielle and her kids got to Posche boutique in Wayne, where we meet Kim D. Danielle says that Kim has been a good friend for a year or so, and she seems supportive ... until she pops up later at Caroline's party. When Teresa asks Kim if she's still friends with Danielle, Kim says she doesn't even know Danielle enough to say that: "I'm not her friend, but I'm not going to say she can't come in the store. It's about being a businesswoman." Kim's escort Michael calls Danielle a pig and says Danielle hooked up with one of his friends, who later "got rid of her." Caroline and Teresa are eager for more details; Dina and Jacqueline look distinctly uncomfortable.

Bottom line: Bush will make some concessions to political reality on judicial appointments, especially in the lower courts. But if a Supreme Court vacancy occurs, the president's first priority will be to cement his legacy by moving the court decisively to the right.
Yet unlike so many of the amateur analysts and professional frauds whose convictions are firmer than is their foundation, experienced NFL players understand that the draft is about projecting unfinished products at a level at which they are unproven. Though there are sure to be some insecure veterans fearful of rookies selected at the same position, they can take comfort in the knowledge that few of those rookies hit the ground ready to make an immediate impact.
The association voted to send a letter objecting to the adjustment if the delay is not forthcoming.
-- The agency's rules apply to community banks, too. But its enforcement won't. Instead, existing regulators will oversee the community banks' compliance. These regulators failed to protect consumers before the crisis. Community banks weren't involved in the risky investing that shook Wall Street. But they issued some high-risk mortgages that consumers couldn't repay. And their lending practices caused the previous banking crisis -- the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s .

The coverage for 2,013 active union members requires only $5 co-payments, no premium contributions and no coinsurance. (That's a percentage of covered costs insured employees must pick up after they reach their deductible -- except TriMet union employees have no deductible.)

Those pro-Romney counties are growing suburbs, so that's "where the votes are" -- and that's a plus for Romney. And yes, Ohio Republicans probably would prefer anyone for president, even Mitt Romney, to any Democrat. But Ohio's March 6 tally suggests enthusiasm for Romney isn't even lukewarm among the salt-of-the-earth Ohioans who go door to door for Republican candidates, distribute their literature and post their signs.

Arizona communities need to protect our dark skies by taking effective steps to control light pollution, as Flagstaff and Tucson are doing.
In a Chrysler advertisement aired during halftime of Sunday's Super Bowl, actor and director Clint Eastwood says, "I've seen a lot of tough eras, a lot of tough downturns in my life, times when we didn't understand each other.

"Once we made the decision that Trent was going to be the guy we went after; even though you think you're pretty safe at four and we were pretty sure Minnesota wasn't going to take a back because they have a fine running back but you never know if someone is going to hop over you into that spot to take your guy, so we had to talk about how far were we winning to go if we had to move up and make the pick. Once that was decided it was easy. Even though a lot of people said we didn't have to move up, we had to move up. Believe me. And we got our guy. At the end of the day if you get your player then the rest of it doesn't mean a whole lot if you get the player you wanted. We got the player we wanted."

In the end, terrorism directed at Americans will diminish when "Western military intervention and political intervention in the Muslim world" diminish.

"I like it because of the flavor," Monk said. "It does not dry out like white meat. White meat, to me, it's flavorless. Any flavor that comes from the meat, it has to come from me seasoning it."
They're also comical. I did not set out to write stories about love and violence but, in the material I kept alighting on, horror and terror just seemed to bubble up. Once I saw that, I may have tried to tease it out, and when the stories were finished I saw the recurring pattern. I'd start with a vague idea that I tried to flesh out and push forward. I don't have total control—I don't see the story until I've written it. Even when I have an idea of what I want a story to be, it changes in the making and takes on a life of its own. I never know what it'll be until I see it on the page. Afterward, I respond to these motifs as a reader might.

I remember going to Shakey's for pizza in the late '60s. It was the experience that was the best. You sat at picnic tables with people you didn't know, had huge pizzas and pitchers of pop and beer. There was music, and I remember people getting up and standing on the tables. I don't know where it was, but as a kid it seemed like a long drive from Lakewood.

Boy and girl, instead of boy and boy, meet by chance on a train in Europe. They talk, get off the train in Vienna, fall in love and talk a lot more until dawn. Meandering and quietly enchanting, this early feature by Richard Linklater stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (and Vienna, which looks a lot more inviting than it does in "The Third Man"). The couple meets again, nine years later, in "Before Sunset," which has some lively moments, but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love, sex and married life.

Foreign language. If the latest cheating allegations of eavesdropping on opposing coaches are true, I think the New Orleans Saints are just complete nincompoops! How, in the limited window that the microphones were open, do you relay information to the coaching staff? I like football because I can view it as a chess match with violence. Charges of cheating against the New England Patriots and now the Saints are ruining it for me. This is akin to learning that Santa Claus isn't real.

What really jumps out at the same point in each player's rookie season is that, in 52 fewer shots, Irving is scoring more than James. Irving is more efficient at ambidextrously "finishing" drives with a lethal crossover dribble, explosive quickness and mid-air body control. But he can also put the ball in the basket at mid-range, at the line, and at long range.

Cook, on the other hand, is siding with Wall Street investors who have long believed the company was only as strong as its last product.

As if the apples and oranges aspect of the story "Dick Cheney and Anna Brown" (April 4)was not enough to take issue with, the photographs chosen to illustrate the article certainly reflect the liberal bias of the Post-Dispatch. Dick Cheney has been in government service most of his life and there must be thousands of photos of him available. To choose the dark photo of a snarling, almost leering Dick Cheney to run alongside the smiling bright photo of a young girl with a ribbon in her hair illustrates not only the story, but it illustrates what the editors of the Post-Dispatch want us to think about the story. This is reminiscent of the darkened magazine cover photo of O.J. Simpson and is in a similar vein to the Trayvon Martin coverage, with the old photo of a 12 year old Trayvon in his football uniform juxtaposed to the mug shot of George Zimmerman. Come on, Post-Dispatch, surely you can hide your bias better than this.

Rose Byrne of "Bridesmaids" wore this trend best with her inky black sequined column from Vivienne Westwood. (She more than atoned for that Elie Saab jumpsuit from the Screen Actors Guild Awards.)

We adored Jenny Packham's '40s-style gowns from her recent New York Fashion Week runway show, and Dita Von Teese, who was in the front row, plucked a glamorous silky pink gown with crystal-studded epaulets. Jennifer Lopez's sequined sunburst gown from Zuhair Murad was a wonder of construction (her body is nothing to sneeze at, either).

He has been quiet in the last few games, probably for a variety of reasons. Part of it is he hasn't had as many opportunities to make plays as he has in some games. Ball carriers and passes haven't been coming into his territory as much. And part of it may be that he's a little worn down or beat up. I don't know that for a fact, but I'm simply raising it as a possibility. We often don't know how players are feeling, or if they are fighting nagging injuries.

_ LIFESTYLE: Bon-vivants or loafers? When it comes to work-life balance, Europeans either got it totally right or lost their minds completely, depending on whom you ask.

"One difference is every time I look up I've got first and second (bases occupied) because they're always on base," Berkman said last week after the Cardinals took two of three in Houston. "That makes it nice. It's always easier to concentrate when you're in a big situation with runners on base. You don't want to get left behind by those guys either. They're two of the best hitters in the game, and you want to try and hang with them as best you can. So there's some of that. It's a lot easier to hit in a lineup where guys are making things happens and pitchers are on the defensive."

That's a lesson the Bay Area and the world could learn something from, says Stewart Winchester, a horticulture instructor at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill. In measurements taken Monday, the Sierra snowpack is holding about 55 percent the normal level of water for this time of year, despite a late March flurry of winter weather.

It was a balmy Wednesday evening in spring 1946. Myrtle Creek was (and still is) a lumber town, on the banks of the Umpqua River 20 miles south of Roseburg.

These values aren't Democratic or Republican. They aren't conservative or liberal values. They're American values. As Democrats, we take pride in what our party has accomplished over the last century: Social Security and the minimum wage; the GI Bill and Medicare; Civil Rights and worker's rights and women's rights. But we also recognize that throughout history, there has been a noble Republican vision as well, of what this country can be. It was the vision of Abraham Lincoln, who set up the first land grant colleges and launched the transcontinental railroad; the vision of Teddy Roosevelt, who used the power of government to break up monopolies; the vision of Dwight Eisenhower, who helped build the Interstate Highway System. And yes, the vision of Ronald Reagan, who despite his aversion to government, was willing to help save Social Security for future generations.

When Adam assigned them "Rich Girl" by Hall and Oates, Orlando claimed he'd never heard of this song. But he's spared the humiliation of having to name which dude is the one rocking the moustache when Adam pulled the song from consideration because it's a key too high for either singer. Instead Adam substituted "Easy" by Lionel Richie, which begs the question, couldn't Team Adam pull some strings with Team Christina and get Richie to be the advisor on his own damn song? We'd maybe get some insight to the song from someone who wasn't in diapers when it came out? No, sorry, Lionel's far too busy coaching a rapper on how to ruin "Satisfaction." Alanis Morissette encouraged Karla to name her inner belter "Bertha" in the hopes that it would bring that side of her out. Orlando's adviser, Robin Thicke, got all Vanna White by requesting vowels, the longer the better. "Vowels are where the strength of the notes are. Not consonants." Good advise that should have already occurred to anyone in the business of stretching syllables, but Thicke didn't stop there. He named Orlando the "Picasso of the group," which may have confused Orlando because he'd probably never heard of him either. Given the lack of struggle this song's lyric projects, Karla seemed the more at ease while Orlando strutted around like a chicken on a hot plate. Christina rightly labeled this performance lackluster on both counts but was more entertained by Karla, who had one sweet falsetto jump programmed late enough in the song to make her the more memorable of the two. But that's like saying the best part of a Sunday morning was the nap it induced.

Voices of one: Having just returned home to Cleveland after a three-week tour, which included an appearance at the "International One Man Band Festival" in Denver, Christa "Uno Lady" Ebert is prepping the release of her debut effort, the cassette-only "I Really Like Genetics, but I'd Rather Have a Good Time." "I've been performing since Thanksgiving of 2007, and it's just me," said Columbia Station native and Ohio City resident Ebert. "I have a looping station. It's original and I'd say experimental. It's really something you have to see. It's hard to describe. Some is prerecorded, some is live looped. It's mostly a cappella. I'm singing over me singing over me singing over me singing. So it's just kind of my own thing." Among the new songs Ebert counts as her favorites are the eerie "Orange Floats" and the mellow "Tiger and the Fireman." You can see Ebert in action at the Fiesta of the Tequila show, which takes place at 7 p.m. Saturday at the Beachland Tavern, 15711 Waterloo Road, Cleveland.

The robot can make three to four chairs a day, and Mr. Vander Kooij predicts a time will come when we will all email our furniture orders to a local robot or 3D printer and watch it being made—a bit like we watch our photos cascading into the flap at the drugstore now.

The Hotel De Anza was once the crown jewel of downtown San Jose. Opened in 1931 and built in just a year, the Art Deco hotel was designed by H.H. Weeks to be the city's only "first class hotel" and it was once the city's tallest building, at 10 stories. During its heyday, the De Anza hosted such luminaries as former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, the DuPonts and boxer Jack Dempsey. But by the 1970s, the hotel was in decline and it was nearly torn down; a face-lift in the 1980s (at 20 times the original construction cost) restored the hotel's historical elements and returned the De Anza to its former glory.

With a pick in every round, the Bears might have the chance to make a value pick on a player with character concerns. Notre Dame receiver Michael Floyd, projected to be drafted in the first round, appears to have allayed many concerns. But there are other talented players who could be drafted lower than expected because of off-the-field issues, including South Carolina receiver Alshon Jeffery and North Alabama cornerback Janoris Jenkins.
The measure also includes a key adjustment to the badly broken Medicare payment formula for doctors, which would otherwise impose a 27 percent cut on March 1 under a 1997 budget law. The $20 billion cost would be covered in part by cuts to a fund created under Obama's health care law that awards grants for preventive care and by curbs on Medicaid payments to hospitals that care for a disproportionate share of uninsured patients.
