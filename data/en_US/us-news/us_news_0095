Dropping Pujols behind Holliday and Puma only further exposes him. Of course, I would doubt TLR would tip his hand if he

Q. What price do I use to depreciate a rental house? I think I should use the purchase price which was $130,000 in 1990. Present market price might be around $215,000. I know I have to deduct the land price so should I take land price from the post card I receive from the township? Can I accelerate the depreciation to get a bigger loss? Will I still be eligible for the exclusion when I sell? I am married and file a joint return and lived in that house for the last 10 years.

It makes sense that more Americans are getting food stamps since that program, known formally as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is open to people of all ages who need help recovering from the recession.

Still, it's puzzling that WIC would be shrinking in these hard times, rather than getting bigger.

Because there is a universal feeling that this is Natalie Portman's moment, "Black Swan" will give her the lead actress award. Because showy performances are an academy weakness, Christian Bale will win the supporting nod. And so on into the night.

Q. My thought -- and this may be totally off-base -- is that for years you were on a mission to show rock fans what a real R&B or blues-rock band was, and perhaps you stayed away from making a more rock-oriented record because you didn't want to be just another rock band. But now you feel freer to do different kinds of albums: You did the hardcore blues album (2001's "Messin' With the Blues") and the Tom Waits covers album (2008's "Grapefruit Moon"), and now you're doing a raw, Stones-y rock album.

The FBI denied a request the AP made on Dec. 2 for internal documents about its interactions with Carrier IQ, citing a provision in the Freedom of Information Act that excludes from disclosure any documents relevant to a "pending or prospective law enforcement proceeding." The FBI also told the AP that releasing the records that it sought could "reasonably be expected to interfere with the enforcement proceedings."

In 1931, nine African-American youths were charged with the rape of two white women in Alabama. True to the conventional meaning of a show trial, their court case was a charade - a racially charged public spectacle featuring an all-white jury and a seemingly prewritten script.

“Eat Heavy’’ announces a neon sign atop the Ticktock, North Jersey’s most famous diner. Open 24 hours in true Jersey diner tradition, the Ticktock has gone through several transformations, from cozy, classic ’50s diner to a gleaming, red-trimmed, multimillion-dollar diner of the present and future. The showy, spacious Ticktock does not set off any culinary fireworks, but it’s solid and dependable like the family car. When you’re hungry, it does the job. The menu is typically encyclopedic, with everything from nachos, popcorn shrimp and mozzarella sticks to burgers, club sandwiches (maybe the best item here), steaks, seafood and desserts. Eat heavy — or light; there are plenty of salads and healthy options on the menu. The 24/7 diner is a dying breed in the nation’s diner capital; only diners on busy highways can afford to stay open around the clock. Kudos, then, to the Ticktock, for its neon sign blazing right through the night into another Jersey morning.

As marketing pitches and product offerings become more tightly tied to our past patterns of behavior, they become more powerful as triggers of future behavior. Already, advertisers are able to infer extremely personal details about people by monitoring their Web-browsing habits. They can then use that knowledge to create ad campaigns customized to particular individuals. A man who visits a site about obesity, for instance, may soon see a lot of promotional messages related to weight-loss treatments. A woman who does research about anxiety may be bombarded with pharmaceutical ads. The line between personalization and manipulation is a fuzzy one, but one thing is certain: We can never know if the line has been crossed if we're unaware of what companies know about us.

Instead, for the first time, we had a long talk about the retirement mentality in the world he's from. Everyone he knows, he said, dreams of retiring with some income properties—it's widely considered a surefire investment. He strained to think of anyone he knows who actually pays the income tax they owe, which helped explain why tax-favored funds don't have the same totemic power for him that they do for me. Most significant, after a childhood marked by horrific hyperinflation and dramatic currency devaluations, it made Alejandro queasy even to contemplate locking money into funds that he wouldn't be able to tap for decades.

Stopping at the old mining town at Bodie State Historic Park is a must in this remote area of the Eastern Sierra south of Bridgeport, Calif.

Part of the grade rises 2,000 feet on the flank of Bodie Peak, which, if you take the time to climb on foot, affords stunning views of the Sierra Crest.

"It's an opportunity for those guys to show us, look, 'I'm worthy of being here, of doing what you ask me to do,'" Giants general manager Jerry Reese said. "Working on their craft, running cards for the offense. It's an opportunity — a great opportunity — for them.

Teenagers have a wicked sense of humor, so their take on life is eye-opening. Joe, who is 14, keeps me laughing when I'm not wondering exactly where he came from. Jessie, a very interesting person at 11, and her Jessie-isms keep us on our toes. As for Kenny, my husband, I have to give credit where credit is due.

In fact, the board gave precisely the same information to Del. Michael Smigiel, a Cecil County Republican and one of the leading proponents of the effort to overturn the immigrant tuition law. Mr. Smigiel wrote on his blog that he was shocked, when he received his disk, to discover that it contained not only the names of those who signed the petition and whether their signatures were accepted or rejected but also their addresses. "It is my opinion," Delegate Smigiel wrote, "that the actions of CASA to date would give petition signers legitimate reason to be concerned about what CASA may do with the lists of names." He went on to accuse CASA volunteers and workers of engaging in voter suppression by handing out fliers and talking to voters at the same locations where petitioners are gathering signatures, and he intimated that those who signed the petitions have a real reason to fear harassment and intimidation.

Many studies have documented the link between alcohol and blood pressure.

But hold on – if Beltran can average one start a week in centerfield, it would open up an additional 20 to 25 starts for Craig in RF. That would bring him up to 90 starts or so, and probably about 450 plate appearances overall. Theoretically, those 450 PA would include a disproportionately high number of important at-bats, because when Craig doesn't start Matheny will be able to save him for game-changing situations (such as the two go-ahead pinch-hits Craig delivered in the World Series). He's only had 343 PA so far in his big-league career, batting .290/.339/.503 with 15 HR and 58 RBI. So 450 PA would let him do plenty of damage.

Seattle S Kam Chancellor. The guy was a major factor in the run game and on the blitz by playing downhill.

But Calipari? “The best experience!” he proclaimed of his Nets days, standing in the hallway outside the Kentucky locker room at the Prudential Center, where the lecture dovetailed into valuable lessons learned from that disaster, how he reflected on his personal failure (Somberly: “I guess I’m still learning that. … ”), how Jersey remains so close to his heart he was going to take a quick trip to see the old homestead up in Franklin Lakes, with a little revisionist history mixed in (not drafting Kobe Bryant was somebody else’s fault).

If Lang was abused by Fine all those years ago, why would he expose his stepbrother to the same man, and allow Davis to take a ball boy job that would leave him as vulnerable as he had been himself?

The evening's one real highlight was an unmannered and perfectly lovely account of the Disney standard "When You Wish Upon a Star." But otherwise, every selection sounded alike, shaped without spontaneity or flavor (the evening's most charmingly unscripted moment came when Evancho mistakenly entered during an orchestral number, then giggled and rushed back offstage). Her phrasing was often stiff, and her husky tone made lyrics difficult to discern.

In a proxy statement filed this week, Belden says its pay is hardly out of control. Compensation policy is full of shareholder-friendly practices, it says, such as holding executives to tough performance standards and not paying the taxes on their perquisites.

With a bit of the David Mamet-ian con about it, Thin Ice follows Mickey as he ingratiates himself with Gorvy, and then, through a series of ill-timed coincidences and encounters, finds himself caught up in a bigger and bigger mess: identity theft, a body dragged across an icy lake, cops sniffing around, and a jumpy ex-con (Crudup) threatening extortion, and, if that doesn't work, extinction.

She's been in Crystal Stilts, Dum Dum Girls and the Vivian Girls. Her second solo effort, "Interstellar," is atmospheric, '80s-flavored dream-pop, easing you in with soothing synths and Rose's wistful sighs before the drums coming crashing in, raising the energy level without necessarily disturbing the mood. And the rest of the album is just as strong, from the upbeat New Wave vibe of "Know Me" to the atmospheric cello-driven closing track, "The Fall."
Damon, who has spent the past few weeks at the clubs facility in Goodyear, Ariz., warming up a swing that has produced nearly 3,000 hits and readying his legs for the grind of his 18th season in the majors, will join the AL Central-leading Indians on Tuesday in Chicago, when they open a three-game series against the White Sox.

Finally comes resignation. You give up, throw aside the limp sheet, turn on the computer or paint the kitchen or sit at the dining room table spooning in carbs and waiting for the sky to lighten. Perhaps you then slump in your chair, sliding into a brief moment of drooling unconscious.
"It was a money decision," he later explained. "I had the security of my mom and dad in my hands. I don't know how my dad made it, paying the bills while we were growing up, but I owe everything to him and my family."

4. It wasn't like that when you got there. Perhaps one of the most unsporting things a vindictive car rental agent can do to you is to assure you that the pre-existing damage you note on a car won't be held against you, but then it's held against you. It happened to Bruce Bennett when he rented a car in Honolulu recently. "When we loaded the car we noticed that there was a hole in the rear bumper and we brought it to the attention of the lot attendant," he remembered. "She told us to tell the person at the gate. We did and they circled the rear bumper on the car diagram and off we went. When we returned the car I told the person checking us in about the damage." But the next month, they got a $738 bill from their car rental company, anyway. Typically, a strongly worded letter to your car rental company with a copy to the state insurance commissioner is enough to reverse those charges.
And so, rather than offer a detailed reform plan as promised Monday night, White offered a sales pitch for the way things are currently going. Of critics, he said, "They don't understand." He referred to those who want to help the district improve -- but don't draw a paycheck from it -- as "people from the outside." He praised teachers but hasn't done anything to inspire the many educators who work in IPS. He pointed to graduation rate increases, but not the flat test scores or the 34 percent increase in the past three years in the number of graduation waivers given to students who couldn't pass basic senior exams.

It was a stunt, but one that grabbed a lot of media attention. Coupled with a burst of advertising, Virgin America grabbed a good share of the business between Orange County and San Francisco. When Virgin America pulled the plug earlier this year, it was because the airline was expanding so fast it didn't have enough aircraft and staff. When Orlando opened up, Virgin America dumped Orange County. It was on to bigger, if not better, things.

San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders has completed his stay on the witness stand. Proposition 8 lawyer Brian Raum asked repeatedly questions to Sanders about his support for gay marriage, and attempted to get him to acknowledge that people who oppose gay marriage are not necessarily motivated by "animus" and "hostility." Raum pressed the mayor about his past position favoring civil unions over same-sex marriage, and asked whether he was motivated then by "hatred" of gays and lesbians.

We're such a polarized country politically that it was impossible to look at "Sarah Palin's Alaska" without seeing a political tint to it. Bristol's show? Same. Although the Palins love to mock the "mainstream media" for intruding into their lives, they can't have it both ways. The Palin family continues to put itself on television in much the same way the Osbourne family has, minus all the talk about drugs and rock 'n' roll. With Bristol trying to dance with the stars and a massive campaign not to have her voted off (what an embarrassment that would be, right?), these little forays into reality bring with them the inevitable bit of knee-jerk political warfare.
The results are impressive. At Jim Thorpe Fundamental School, three-fourths of the students are impoverished enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, and more than 60% aren't fluent in English.

So this review of "The Trinity Six" must be light on the plot summary: Sam Gaddis is a professor and writer of Slavic history who starts researching the possibility of a sixth British-born Cold War spy, revising what has been known as the Cambridge Five in Britain, the Magnificent Five in Russia.
