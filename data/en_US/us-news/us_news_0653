Dinner for two is still a big draw. The steaks are good, and the prime rib is always a crowd-pleaser. But the side dishes are ordinary, and the options are limited. If you're looking for vegetables, you're out of luck.
When he presented his evolving views, Obama tread cautiously. He acknowledged that many Americans have religious objections and said that influenced his decision not to endorse gay marriage earlier. He spoke of his decision in personal, not political, terms, noting his experience with the gay parents who serve on his staff or who are raising friends of his daughters, Sasha and Malia.
Henrique opened the scoring when he tipped the puck past Theodore to get New Jersey on the board and silence an anxious crowd.

On the cliff top just north, meanwhile, looms the immense yellow-orange Hacienda Cerritos, a 30,000-square-foot walled mansion that's unfortunately visible for miles. Workers said it was built as a private home last year by Oregon developer Roger Pollock. Pollock's finances having become complicated in the recession, the hacienda has been recast as a hotel, renting 11 rooms for $295 and up nightly. The tour befuddled me. Even with multiple zero-horizon pools, a massive patio, handsome tiles and big ocean views, the place felt somehow iffy, more like a rental house than a hotel and costlier than anything else I saw.

Next time — My sister and I are both very early risers. The pool doesn't open until 8 a.m., and the shuttles to the beach don't start until 9 a.m. However, there are several cruises and excursions that head out as early as 7 a.m. So instead of wasting time lounging around the hotel room, I would have booked something earlier in the day (and avoided the crowds).

Answer: "I think it's being addressed by much more aggressive marketing. I think they're going to continue to improve next year. New ticket sales are going to be good, too, and they've put together a pretty impressive plan to get this where it should be because the team is pretty good and the attendance is not, but I think the organization has improved in a very positive way."

Kees published regularly in the New Yorker and the Partisan Review (no mean combo). He was a jazz pianist and a painter who exhibited with the Abstract Expressionists. He became art critic of the Nation and was friendly not only with Agee but with the cartoonist Charles Addams, novelists Anton Myrer and Conrad Aiken, poets Allen Tate and Kenneth Rexroth and critics Hugh Kenner, Manny Farber, Harry Levin and Edmund Wilson.

Rocinha is not the only community in which the program ran into trouble. In September, an anonymous tipster notified pacification unit chiefs that some of the officers patrolling the bohemian Santa Teresa neighborhood were taking monthly payments from drug dealers in exchange for their lenience.

One aspect of that is pay. Compared to other high-achieving countries, U.S. teachers are not underpaid.

Sometimes, as above, the flavors get too big. An otherwise superb Naya Burger ($11) probably doesn't need the assertive taste of smoked gouda along with the roasted red peppers, grilled onion and marinated lettuce. Ditto with the falafel ($10).

That silence bothers Summerscale. What hovers around Whicher's theories, and Summerscale's, is a sense that something is still missing. There is that cool demeanor once again, when Constance confesses, and elements of her murder account contradict that of investigators. Summerscale conjectures that Constance took the blame to draw attention away from someone else. This is exactly what Whicher reported to his superiors. It is also, the author points out, what happens in "The Moonstone." It is a fascinating literary parallel. I won't tell you who that possible accomplice might have been. Suffice to say, Constance's conviction may have left another beast to wander the labyrinth.

What's shocking about Marley is how little film exists of the Wailers in performance. Bands more obscure and less interesting have music videos and concert footage that could fill a storage facility; Macdonald, who was given the go-ahead for the film by Blackwell and Rita Marley (who oversees her late husband's royalty-rich estate), had only a handful of scratchy 16mm films and videos to work with. Still, what there is conveys Marley's magnetism, and footage from the "Smile Jamaica" concert, a tumultuous event that followed an attempt on Marley's life, is, if not musically riveting, certainly dramatic.

Michael Todd, who died in a plane crash a year after their 1957 marriage, gave Taylor a Cartier ruby suite — necklace, bracelet and earrings — while she was swimming laps in their pool in the south of France and wearing a diamond tiara he had bought her.

Consumers who are avoiding products by Limbaugh's advertisers are engaged, whether they know it or not, in what's known in labor law as a secondary boycott. This means boycotting a company you have no grievance with, except that it does business with someone you do have a grievance with. Secondary boycotts are generally frowned on, or in some cases (not this one) actually illegal, on the grounds that enough is enough. And there's sense to that outside the labor context too. Do we want conservatives organizing boycotts of advertisers on MSNBC, or either side boycotting companies that do business with other companies who advertise on Limbaugh's orRachel Maddow's shows?

Then he committed an act as jaw-droppingly disturbing as any I've ever reported. He dragged Za'Zell from the bedroom to the living room and propped her up on the sofa so she could "watch" her daughters unwrap their gifts.

Listen to their ideas and let them participate in a range of sports and activities. They will eventually have one they feel the most passion for, but keep up the variety a little bit. Don't forget to give them down time. Even pro athletes need a break every now and again. Finally, mix it up every year. Nothing gets more boring than the same old routine. The key is to not use the same muscles constantly. The more you mix it up, the healthier they will be! And much happier, too!

Like “Blunderbuss,” Norah Jones’ “Little Broken Hearts” is a breakup album. Like Jack White, Jones is angrier and more vulnerable than she has been in a long time. “The Fall,” Jones’ 2009 album, was an aggressive step forward, but didn’t entirely convince; “Broken Hearts” succeeds where its predecessor did not by dispensing with the loud guitar and concentrating on raw, lovelorn, occasional arresting storytelling. “Miriam,” in particular, is Jones at her most direct: She promises to torture and kill a romantic rival. (Sounds like she means it, too.) Producer Danger Mouse, who co-wrote the entire set with Jones, matches the sharp melodies with accompaniment that owes a bit to Tom Waits at his most atmospheric, a bit to Rilo Kiley at its most languorous and strung-out, and a bit to Elvis Costello at his most impressionistic. Very little of the music could be described as jazz, or even jazzy, so longtime fans might see “Broken Hearts” as further proof of the artist’s defection. But Jones is more interesting as a pop star than she ever was as a chanteuse, and it’s nice to see that she’s finally figured out how to get there.

So, how did Lauren's on-the-spot a cappella of "Rolling in the Deep" go at the Green Room? All thumbs up. The girl can cross the vocal terrains with a natural powerhouse that's got a bit of that bitey grain that makes a songstress out of a singer. In addition she knows when to come in and when to back away from a microphone, so the clarity stays tight and the listener has time to take in all the lyrics while enjoying being knocked "metaphorically" right out of their seat.

Really, at this point, Babbitt still doesn't even have a position.
