"I am saddened to see differences, rather than our shared values, emphasized as we near election time. Unfortunately, some among us are also too easily forgetful that taking care of the homeless, the unemployed, the uninsured, and the elderly are our mutual concerns.
* Speaking of QBs, it's not set in stone that the Browns will keep three quarterbacks on the active roster. If they stock up on receivers and keep four tight ends, the third quarterback may pay the price. Contributing to the decision might be Jarrett Brown's 1-for-6 performance with one INT in sporadic preseason play. This is not to say the Browns have soured on Brown as a developmental prospect. In fact, Shurmur said he feels good about "some of the progress" Brown has shown and believes he has a lot of ability. But everyone knows Brown needs a lot of growth before he can perform at an acceptable level in an NFL game. Could be practice squad-bound.

That's why Romney's shift to Obama's side in the president's battle with House Republicans over student loans may be his most instructive flip-flop yet. It shows that Romney will do all he can to soften his underlying radicalism. His goal is to deprive Obama of ways to reveal the concrete impact of free-market utopianism -- and the price of the cutbacks Romney embraced by endorsing Rep. Paul Ryan's budget.

Let's also stipulate that Mr. Nighy is one of the great comic actors of any time. Here, however, he's a glum presence in a role of bleak passivity. Ms. Smith spends most of her screen time in a wheelchair, complaining nastily about everything under the Jaipur sun. Dev Patel has been encouraged, or allowed, by the director, John Madden, to overact wildly and wave his arms grotesquely as the hotel's desperate young proprietor. Only Ms. Dench gets to play a scene worthy of her gifts. Her character, Evelyn Greenslade, has gone out and hustled herself a job at an Indian call center; suddenly she's plunged into the witty give and take of teaching a young Indian woman how to keep a client on the line. The scene is about listening well, thinking quickly and responding creatively. Unlike the rest of this inert film, it's alive.

Obama strategists hope to do more than just energize women voters. They are convinced the positions Romney took in the primary season on issues such as birth control and health care access for poor women will not only complicate his attempted move to the middle but serve to drive some Republican women and GOP-leaning independents into the president's camp.

It's highly unusual for a car rental company to charge an extra driver fee for a spouse, but such a surcharge isn't illegal. It is something of a money grab, though. Does it cost the car rental company more if your wife, brother or son drives your rental? No. Will your car insurance cover damage to the vehicle if it's damaged? Check with your insurance company, but I've never heard of an "extra driver" fee having any relevance in a claim that involves a driver's insurance company.

Revelations of neglect, theft and other misconduct by guardians and conservators prompted Minnesota lawmakers to strengthen oversight of the unlicensed profession in 2009, but advocates say the system still falls short. While guardians and conservators must register with the courts by 2013, they are not required to pass any tests or possess any specialized skills. Applicants are required to submit to a criminal background check, but court officials don't have to determine whether applicants have been disciplined for misconduct by a state licensing board.

Glazer isn’t sure the period casting challenges are limited to Miami — though he admits he didn’t actually have to go out and find the bodies.

They were also successful 71 percent of the time.

Now, if the majority of Americans are skeptical of a blanket amnesty, they are also skeptical that it is possible to round up and deport 11 million people. They know it's not possible. Such an effort would be logistically impossible and wildly expensive. Moreover, it would tear at the very fabric of this nation -� because immigrants who are here illegally are now intricately woven into that fabric. Many have children who are American citizens. Some are children themselves, brought here by their parents at a very young age, growing up as American kids, only to discover their illegal status when they apply for college or a job. Migrant workers -� mostly here illegally -� have been the labor force of our farmers and agricultural producers for generations. So even if it was possible, a program of mass deportations would disrupt our economy and communities in ways that most Americans would find intolerable.

The disorder is typically treated with anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, carbamazapine or valproate. Such drugs are effective in controlling seizures in perhaps as many as 60% of cases. But when the patient fails treatment with at least two different drugs, their epilepsy is said to be medically refractory and they are candidates for surgery. Such surgery removes the area of the brain that is misfiring and causing the seizures. Physicians typically insert electrodes into the brain to identify the source of the electrical disturbance, then remove a small amount of tissue that is involved. The most common type of procedure is called a lobectomy.

Such a notion explains Weschler's long interest in the visual arts. His first job after graduating from UC Santa Cruz's Cowell College in 1974 was at UCLA, where he worked as an editor on a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded oral history of the Los Angeles art scene. It was here that he first heard of Irwin, who was approaching what he would later call "Point Zero," the place of ultimate reduction in which he sought to eradicate the distinction between art and the outside world. If this sounds abstract, it is, but it's also highly concrete -- the kind of apparent contradiction on which Weschler thrives.

This either-or view fails to reflect the reality that Los Angeles needs all three — elementary, secondary and adult education — if it is to have a literate and educated population.

"This book is really about integration. I always saw things in black and white," Smithwick said. "I thought if I did horses, I couldn't do other things because the horse lifestyle is very demanding and draining. It took me a while to realize I could ride again and still be a husband, father and writer."

It's a Darwinian view. Having lived nearly all of his 64 years within the patrician bubble, or the bubble of high finance, Romney's idea of the common touch is to debate with his aides whether the pair of jeans he's about to don should be Levis or Gap 1969s. That's pretty funny.

“The point for me is that this is an instrument, and people are able to identify my own tunes and my conception of music in it,” Metheny said. “Imagine a gas gauge — all the way to the left is a blank piece of paper, all the way to the right is a fully complete musical score. A lot of that’s done by my feet.”

In the 1980s, the negotiations started not with a plan from the White House or Congress but from an independent and bipartisan commission chaired by Alan Greenspan. Such a framework could be tried again in 2013, but the only question is whether Social Security's finances are in bad enough shape to justify the effort.
The brothers had no visible reaction when the verdict was read, though Eliyahu's wife left the courtroom in tears.

Eliyahu now faces up to 10 years on the assault count at sentencing in June.

Early in his career, Mr. Kan developed an interest in renewable energies, and he still proudly shows a fading picture of himself as a young, long-haired legislator visiting a Colorado wind farm. He discussed wind power during a parliamentary session in 1982, drawing a rebuke from the then-minister of science and technology, who, according to the legislative transcript, chided him: "Don't use it as a reason to reject nuclear power; don't get too excited or carried away."
His work's simplicity, its elements pretty well established by the time of McLaughlin's 1952 solo debut at Felix Landau Gallery, is deceptive. But its acute perceptual sophistication would set the stage for 1960s Light and Space art — for Robert Irwin, Doug Wheeler, Larry Bell and others whose sculptures and installations forged L.A.'s first distinctive contribution to American art. McLaughlin was their forerunner.

With a tiny tax base, the city of nearly 80,000 relies on the state for most of its funding. But the state slashed aid this year because of a fiscal crisis of its own.
If Mr. Ehrlich had done a more thorough investigation, he would have discovered that the situation is due almost entirely to a failure to purge records to account for persons who have died or moved away from the voting district. Time and again, we have been presented with evidence that actual voter fraud, that is citizens purporting to be someone else when appearing at the voting booth, has been virtually nonexistent in the U.S. for decades.
Although details of the proposed legislation were not immediately available, the source indicated it would follow some of the changes Gov.

All job applications will ask something about the applicant's possible experience with the military. Military experience should not be considered irrelevant, even if that experience may have been 15 or 20 years ago. Presidential Executive Order 11701 requires companies having federal government contracts to give preference to hiring veterans. They audit companies to make sure they give this preference. Thus, provide full information even if you think it is insignificant. Common application information for veterans includes: branch of service, discharge date, discharge type, training received, rank upon discharge and duties.

Board members wanted to minimize the effect on students by not cutting such areas as general state aid dollars that are distributed to schools. Though textbook funding got axed, districts can still use their state aid money for books, Fergus said.
4. Macintosh (1984) -- Like the Lisa, the Macintosh had a graphical user interface. It was also cheaper and faster and had the backing of a large advertising campaign behind it. People soon realized how useful the graphical interface was for design. That led "desktop publishing," accomplished with a Mac coupled to a laser printer, to soon become a sales driver.
Paul Huffman, the university's archivist, replied almost immediately. He told us that the woman we were trying to reach now is known as Margaret Clarke Linn. She attended Lindenwood during the 1940-41 and 1941-42 academic years and now lives in Webster Groves.

There are two photos of the same man taken 50 years apart, a postcard from a father to his daughter from the front lines of World War I, a rosary, a tiny calendar-diary and two calling cards. With these clues, Stratton, who has become ill with fever and taken to bed, uses all his skills as a translator and researcher to put flesh on the bones of the story. As he unpacks the box, more clues emerge.

But it would be remiss to have this discussion and not point out the second goal scorer against Detroit, Andy McDonald. No less remarkable, McDonald has had two lengthy injury absences, including one that was concussion related.

Now we're on North Albina Street, for another "Portlandia" signature -- a customer who can't get service. A guy calls the DMV about getting a replacement title, and days pass as he waits on the phone, while DMV workers (Brownstein and Armisen) noodle around on instruments. Finally, the guy gets a letter in the mail -- not helping him with his request, but including a CD by the DMV workers. Having fun at the expense of long DMV waits is certainly universal, and a time-honored comedy tradition, but it doesn't seem particularly unique to the "Portlandia" world.

Wait . . . they were restricted? Yes, absolutely. The new freedom is easy to see even when you use the new iPad to run old old apps that haven't been optimized in any way. iOS renders all standard text and and all standard user elements at Retina quality automatically. The change can be transformative. River Of News, a Google Reader client that was last updated four months ago, is practically a new app. The left-hand column of subscriptions that once was a little too small and a little too difficult to read now looks like shrewd design. It's perfectly readable. The smaller text seems to say "Yeah, you want your attention over there on the article to my right. But hey, I'm here if you get bored and you want to browse for something else to read."

"My theory that I just explained to you about why -- you know, what could have John Edwards' motivations been to have the affair with Rielle Hunter, given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this, and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk."

"I'm sitting there with units that won't sell, too — it's unconscionable," said Andrew Viola, a regional manager with Williamsburg-based Bush Construction Corp., which built the 414 Water Street condos in downtown Baltimore. "We're paying our fair share. Why shouldn't every other developer?"
What happened: Firms including Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate bonds to help investors analyze the risk and return trade-off. Critics say the rating agencies masked the crisis by giving inflated grades to mortgage-backed securities underpinned by subprime loans. Critics also contend the rating agencies harbored actual or perceived conflicts of interest, because the investment banks that packaged those securities for sale to investors are the ones who paid for the ratings. Of note, the diversification created by linking dozens of mortgages to a given security didn't help lessen risk as expected.
The only player taken with the top pick in that stretch who played more than one year of college basketball was Blake Griffin, who entered the draft after his sophomore season at Oklahoma.
Anderson gushes about the impact of sophomore pitcher Nathan Jacobson and infielder Jamari Campbell, who Anderson said has "some Jerry Manuel in his game." Winning, the coach said, is intoxicating.

“It sucks, honestly for him, first of all,” James said. “We all know he’s a guy who’s pretty much been durable throughout his NBA career so far, and there for the Magic or our team. He’s a big part of our team in the Olympics, and I hate to lose him because of an injury. I wish him the best and hope he gets back to full strength.”
Erin Emmans owns Teasers Salon on Main Street and the Thrift Cellar downstairs. The salon is a destination stop for customers, but those customers have been arriving late for appointments since the work began. The Thrift Store relies on impulse shoppers. With no large visual presence to attract passersby and no sidewalk for foot traffic, the shop has felt the effect of the concrete breaking outside. "It will be beautiful when it's finished," Emmans said of her block. "But right now, my customers are not happy."

Before games, I set goals for myself, so I set how many goals I want to get, how many assists, interceptions, stuff on defense and it feels great when I reach them. Because I feel like I set my goals so high, in games when I don't do well even though I still might have done well to me I failed, because I didn't reach the goals I wanted to reach. And in school, it's gotten so much better senior year, but as a freshman and sophomore if I got below a 90, I'd go home and cry. I'd be, "No. I got a B." My mom would be like, "Sam, that's ridiculous. You put too much pressure on yourself." (Laughs)
The physical effects of the quakes were easy to spot in Sumner, but you wouldn't know it from the students having a picnic on the circular green, the surfers watching the horizon for waves or the family playing beer pong on the beach. It was the most carefree we had seen the locals (outside a pub) since we arrived.

If the Sacketts "had wanted a judicial resolution of the coverage question without subjecting themselves to potential penalties, they could have filed a permit application before discharging, they could have gotten review there.

So how does a patriotic American decide which lobby to believe? You might start by asking, Which one is more obviously trying to buffalo me? Clearly that is the Billsters (let's call them) with their ludicrous attempt to create patriotic sentiment around the dollar bill. Then you might ask, Which side has hired Frank Luntz? Once again, it's the dollar bill people.

Is the Deep Throat story over? Yes, in the sense that it will no longer be treated as a mystery. In spite of the million questions we'll be hearing--and there are and will be many serious questions--the MSM will stick with the heroic narrative. Mr. Felt was Deep Throat. Deep Throat was a great man who helped a great newspaper put the stop to the lies and abuses of an out-of-control White House. End of story. Why? Because in celebrating this story in a certain way journalists of a certain age celebrate themselves. Because to bring unwelcome and unwanted skepticism to the narrative would be to deny 20th-century journalism--and 21st-century journalists--their great claim to glory. Because the MSM is still liberal, and the great Satan of all liberals, still, is Richard Nixon. And because, as Ben Bradlee might say, It's a goddamn good story.

Talk about a fun wine: Its color made me think of the cherry Lifesavers I loved as a kid. But don't be misled by the hue. Although it tastes of cherries and strawberries, this is not a sweet wine. It's dry - but not bone dry - and it has a refreshing citrusy finish that's great for the summer. It also has a bit more body than some rosés, making it a nice option for red wine lovers seeking a chilled wine for al fresco dining on a warm afternoon.

Steen and Russell last played on Dec. 27 in a loss at Detroit. Steen scored a goal in that disappointing 3-2 outcome and began experiencing concussion-related issues the same night.

"He is a man's man," Valentine said of Varitek. "He was a big hitter when needed. He was a leader of the pitching staff. He was able to beat up Alex. All that stuff is good stuff. He was exactly what he was supposed to be."
That the Red Wings are one loss from being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs is on the shoulders of Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne, who denied enough scoring chances to provide highlights for a week's worth of shows. His heroics were the Wings' undoing, as they fell, 3-1, at Joe Louis Arena. The Predators hold a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series headed into Friday's Game 5 at Bridgestone Arena, site of the Wings' only win last Friday.

The takeaway: The Rams topped Drexel, 59-56, Monday in the CAA title game, ending the Dragons' 19-game winning streak. Troy Daniels, a 6-4 junior, averages 10.0 ppg and is VCU's top 3-point shooter at 38.5 percent. In the win over Drexel, Darius Theus had a career-high 16 points and five steals to lead the Rams, who were the biggest story of last year's NCAA Tournament when they won five times to reach the Final Four. Like last year, the Rams are tough defensively. They allow opponents to shoot 59.8 percent from the field, 23rd nationally; and allow just under 10 assists per game, 18th nationally.

Expected role if lockout ends: Instantly becomes the Blazers' starting point guard, replacing Andre Miller, the player he was traded for on draft night. Because Felton excels in the open floor and in the pick and roll, the Blazers could be poised to replace their methodical style with a more uptempo offense. A standout season would reinforce the Blazers' belief that their revolving door at point guard is over and he could run the show for years to come.

Christopher Garrens Let Them Eat Cake is known for the kind of wedding cakes that end up on Food Network reality shows, so it shouldn't be a surprise that their breakfasts are similarly grandiose. With that in mind, I still don't think anything could have prepared me for just how over-the-top their pastries are. On the menu, the selection of scones, muffins and sandwiches sounds innocent enough. After a taste, though, it's clear that these treats are several times richer than ordinary fare.
