The State Board of Education was right to reject Anne Arundel County Executive John Leopold's attempt to evade the spirit of a law that prevents local jurisdictions from slacking off in their support for public schools. Protest though he might that he had done nothing wrong, Mr. Leopold's budget for the current fiscal year provided less money to support classroom education than in the year before, and had his effort been allowed to stand, that difference — amounting to about $12 million a year — would have been cemented into perpetuity.

Oregon right-hander Alex Kuedell (4-3) tossed seven shutout innings against the Bruins, scattering eight hits while striking out two. The senior is now 3-0 in his last three starts, and has tossed 22 consecutive shutout innings.
Tax considerations: After you hit 701/2, you must start pulling money out of IRA and 401(k) accounts or face a 50 percent IRS penalty (Roth IRAs don't have this withdrawal requirement). If you're fully retired, you might not itemize deductions and might not even need to file a tax return because of low income. Conversely, affluent seniors might face taxes on some Social Security benefits.

As Renacci prepared to vote on a Dec. 13 GOP plan that combined the payroll tax cut extension with other GOP priorities, including accelerated review of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Democrats hammered him with yet another news release accusing him of trying to skip off on vacation "rather than protect 5.8 million middle income Ohio families from a $1,000 payroll tax increase."

Morris may be a loser, but he neither languishes in self-pity nor lashes out at his father or the world in general. Seymour is remarkably tolerant of his son's habit of squandering money he gives him for groceries that he forgets to buy. It is an unrewarding role for Fonda, who spends much of his screen time glumly lounging around the apartment in his bathrobe. Seymour still seems to be grieving the loss of his wife, who died when Morris was 14. But when the movie finally addresses the subject, it is too little, too late.

That balance proved both impressive and reassuring to James Burns, the real-life inspiration for "Jamesy Boy." His family had known the Whites, and Trevor and Tim both say they were vaguely aware of Burns' problems with the law, spending time in a Colorado jail on an armed robbery conviction. But they didn't know the full story, about the hard-bitten inmate who helped turn his life around, until Burns came out to visit Trevor in Los Angeles.

This approach also works well with the many-splendored sushi sampler ($20). Well prepared and sparkling fresh sushi and sashimi are presented in various wraps of nori, or encrusted in individualized spice mixes and served on lightly pickled kim chee cabbage or vinegared wakame seaweed julienne. The barely seared white tuna "sashimi" in the assortment, with its meaty texture and deep sea taste, epitomizes the umami experience.

“I probably overreacted,” Drew said Monday. “I grabbed Ivan after the game walking through the tunnel and told him to give me a hug. I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong about something.”
The voice of Kyle's wife, Tara, also deserves attention. Several passages of her comments are interspersed with her husband's story of war and killing. The passages are spare but revealing. In one of these, she finds the idea that her husband is restrained by official rules-of-engagement against an enemy who isn't to be "more than ridiculous, it's despicable." Later, estrangement sets in: "Little by little, I realized I wasn't the most important thing in his life. The words were there, but he didn't mean it."

This is payback, of sorts, from a few weeks ago when Arthur took the opportunity to send a pair from his team to the Red Team, in exchange for a Red Team couple. Arthur's reasoning was that he was trying to protect himself and his father from being sent home, and bringing in a new team that had no alliances with the Black Team would make them more vulnerable to being eliminated. Or that's what Arthur thought.

Last year began with signs of healthier growth. But then the economy endured a series of shocks. Gasoline prices surged after political unrest triggered by the Arab Spring. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan slowed the flow of supplies to U.S. auto plants and other factories.

With just five months until the November election, the fundraising frenzy underscores the increasing clout of what some jokingly call "gay-dough" - a potential counterweight to millions in Wall Street money being scooped up by Republican super PACs and the campaign of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
The day's events provided a study in contrasts. Dayton took an aggressively pro-stadium stance, pledging to "meet with everybody and everyone" to get the deal done, and "take the lead in terms of negotiations" with the National Football League and the Vikings. Koch said she generally supported having the Vikings remain in Minnesota but joined the Dayton meeting Monday just "for the discussion."

"The Hunger Games" is rated PG-13 for intense violent thematic material and disturbing images - all involving teens.
I think the Congress is on the right track this time. The public just has to realize that we are in for a quite lengthy period of economic recovery — several years and perhaps more to muddle along, as in the 1930s. Let's just stay sensible about it and not get into demonstrations and fights like they are having in Greece. They do not help solve the problem.

A brother who lives a half-block away, Armando Aguilar, told Tribune reporters he had seen Pedro washing his taxi at the house just days earlier. Shown the FBI wanted poster for his brother, Armando Aguilar cursed softly and said: "I am shocked that this happened in 1996 and I didn't know about it."
No one has been charged. Thomas Kwok, 60, and Raymond Kwok, 58, have denied any wrongdoing. They are estranged from their brother after ousting him as Sung Hung Kai's chairman and CEO in 2008 amid a bitter feud over control of the company.
Michele Bachmann wants a double-wall fence. This self- proclaimed fiscal conservative doesn't flinch at the cost or seem to understand that the Border Patrol told Congress on Oct. 4 the existing fence already covers all the areas where it is "operationally required."

It uses the amphetamine phentermine, which suppresses appetite. The other drug is topiramate, an anticonvulsant sold by Johnson & Johnson as Topamax. Topiramate is believed to make patients feel more satiated, though it's unclear exactly how.

Mrs. Markovich, who works 70-hour weeks as the marketing and finance chief for a pizza chain, doesn't want to wait for her husband to finish the entire house, a process that can be interrupted by extraneous kicks and sofa-lifts.

Critics such as Lisa A. Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, say the setup allows law firms to "harvest" clients from throughout the country and "extort" high-dollar settlements in a fast-paced environment that cripples a defendant's ability to prepare for trial.

3. Lovie Smith wouldn’t say where Chris Williams will line up when players hit the field for drill work in the voluntary offseason workout program, but it isn’t hard to jump to a conclusion. The guess is Williams, after spending most of the last two seasons at guard, will be back at tackle. First, here is what Smith said when I asked him if Williams would begin at left guard, where the 2008 first-round draft pick made nine starts last season before a season-ending wrist injury and 11 starts to end the 2010 season.

Three, the Rockies need Helton's glove at first base. Jason Giambi can't fill that role day after day, and I'm not sure Michael Cuddyer or somebody else could fill in without the defense suffering.
Except it’s not 2009. It’s 2011, and because of another tablet computer with a touchscreen that’s been around for 18 months or so — hmm, the name escapes me for the moment — you realize the Kindle Fire isn’t everything a tablet computer can be. It is not the most amazing computer you’ve ever seen. Compared with that other tablet, it’s undersized, sometimes slow and lacking the wondrous mix of beauty and functionality in the one that’s gotten all the attention.
The White Bird modern dance series has just hired its first-ever general manager, and the choice is an unconventional one: lawyer, journalist and notorious bad-boy Phil Busse.

Wheatley says leaving Wickliffe "was a very difficult decision to make." She cites professional growth and a desire to one day become a full superintendent as key factors in her decision. Wheatley adds that Eastland-Fairfield is "a large, coveted school district."
To facilitate all of this, the plan anticipates setting up a formal "Allocation Dispute Protocol" under which the judge could oversee litigation of the disputes and reallocate the settlement proceeds accordingly before the company emerges. Alternatively, he could set the disputes aside until after the company emerges and hear the cases later. In that instance, the plan would reserve up to $215 million of the settlement proceeds to be distributed when the disputes are resolved.
Witnesses said police demanded to know where the gun was. Eventually they arrested Tony Hallmon, 51 -- the only person charged -- for the assault on Wilson.
Illinois taxpayers, as well as those with a taste for financial horror shows, now have a convenient place for finding out how the state spends its money. State Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka this month has been traveling the state touting an online site she calls "The Ledger" which puts most of the state's financial data in one handy site.

“We’ve been in business for a very long time and it’s a family operation but the restaurant business is a very low-profit business,” he said Friday. “So it’s hard to keep an operation going and I think we’ve done a pretty good job so far, but the legal action and the legal fees that come with them don’t make life any easier, that’s for sure.”
"The language that we hear about the Obama administration waging war against religion is both energizing and polarizing," said Ralph Keen, chair of Catholic studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "The person who declares that there is an Obama-led war against religion is going to be recognized as the leader of a cause that mobilizes. It's going to mobilize the religious population."
Guthrie routinely rides his bike to and from the ballpark, a practice he has carried on for years. He rode his bike during spring training in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Yes, the Ducks played with passion. Yes, they trusted each other as great teams always do -- and Kelly talked about his players "believing in the guy to the right and left of 'em."

The grilled chicken panini ($6.75) uses the same slightly tough but perfectly sliced chicken as the salad, but here it is married with roasted red peppers, melted mozzarella and pesto aioli.

The "Yonkers" video — in which Tyler eats a gigantic bug while rapping, and then vomits it out, all on camera — has been played on YouTube more than 10 million times. That was the first clip from "Goblin"; "She" is likely to get the second. The song matches Tyler’s obsessive, violent storytelling with production that sounds like synthesized Kanye West that has curdled through exposure to dissonance, and a cold-eyed R&B chorus by Odd Future member Frank Ocean. For all his iconoclasm, the provocative emcee doesn’t really challenge the formal conventions of songwriting; "Goblin" is paced like an old-school hip-hop (or even rock) concept set, with musical moods carefully controlled and profane eruptions artfully spaced out.

We've taken the best of the traditional bridal or wedding shower (typically held two months before the wedding date and is essentially the same kind of gift–giving celebration as ours) and housewarming party (held within three months of moving in), and turned them into a new kind of party. The basic wedding shower guidelines of professional event planner Veronica Whitehead still apply, with some creative tweaks of your own. For instance, she notes that the would–be bridal party normally organizes, hosts and pays for the event with family members sometimes contributing. For this party, the husband's family and his would–be groomsmen can also contribute. It's prudent to work out the budget and financial commitments as a first step.

He just doesn't get it, not even in the game of basketball, at which he is supposed to be such an intuitive genius. He does not really know the body angles needed to post up.

Using a stool sample that is taken at home, this noninvasive test identifies DNA markers for colon cancer. Though not covered by some insurances, the $250 cost of this test is much less than that of a colonoscopy, which can cost more than $3,000 when not covered by insurance or when insurance is unavailable. Colosure is now available for order by doctors and more testing is under way to improve the sensitivity of the test. This stool DNA test should be considered in cases where colonoscopies are not feasible, for reasons such as financial and medical concerns.

Inhibition and a comical preference for naturalism run deep in Dunham and her work. She's a self-declared "over-sharer" whose Twitter feed is a steady stream of self-deprecating wit.

The premise is that an ambitious mayor (Andrew Daley) wants to close down Jellystone Park because of its budget deficit and then sell off the logging rights. When straight-arrow Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) is given a week to raise the money and save the park, he plans a 100th anniversary picnic and fireworks show, with the help of a visiting documentary filmmaker named Rachel (Anna Faris, once again adding ditzy charm to a dull movie). But then inventive oaf Yogi and his bow-tied sidekick Boo Boo (nasal voice by Justin Timberlake) get into the act. Cue the booty-shaking rap song.

Hey, Tony: Count me in the small group of Browns fans who is against giving Hillis a very lucrative long-term deal. I love the way he plays and there is no doubt he is very good running back. However, he is not Adrian Peterson, Chris Johnson, MJD or even Ray Rice. He is not a game breaker and he takes a physical beating meaning he won't last long. I would like to see the Browns give a substantial but reasonable three- to four-year deal. Like they did with Cribbs. -- Ryan F, Behind Enemy Lines, Md.

In Northern India, marginalized Muslim women print press and stamp images on recycled paper created from old newspapers, cotton rags and denim jeans. Your purchase of Raven + Lily stationary helps these women to support their families and maintain their independence.

Naperville, if you weren't aware, was once voted the No. 1 city in the U.S. in which to raise children. Money Magazine named it "Best Place to Live" in the Central United States among populations of more than 100,000 in 2010. (And 2008, and 2006, and 2004.) When Chicago restaurateurs make the leap to open in the suburbs, Naperville is often first on their list. The town's premier bookshop, Anderson's, recently was named Publishers Weekly Bookstore of the Year. And among numerous other perks -- an incredible public library, a thriving public parks system -- it's got a lovely little river walk, a prolific public art system and some beautifully preserved architecture (including one of the nation's original Burger Kings).

The current debate over same-sex marriage has been framed as a "civil rights" issue, but this is incorrect. Civil rights are defined as the extension of 13th and 14th amendment rights to minorities, where minority status is based on race, religion or ethnic background. Lifestyle choices do not fall under this definition. This bill protects religious institutions from being forced to "solemnify" same sex marriages, but by addressing the personal rights issues of homosexuals through the redefinition of marriage as opposed to the use of civil unions, the state has now put itself in the position of "solemnifying" a life style choice. By electing to do this, the bill over steps the government's responsibility to protect an individual's basic constitutional rights and makes the government the promoter of morality, which is a clear violation of First Amendment separation of church and state.
"Pure, petty, negative politics," Dewhurst said of the Republican attacks. However, while trying to keep his campaign focused on President Barack Obama, Dewhurst recently lashed out at his Republican detractors with an ad blitz.

Still, the Heat have been turning the ball over too much (38 in the last two games), and after shooting 39.8 percent on 3-pointers before the break, Miami has shot 33.6 percent from the arc since. Wade is probably right, and this is just a speed bump for the Heat, but it’s been a costly bump—they now trail Chicago by 3.5 games in the race for the East’s top seed.
I get that there are concerns about the impact on wildlife if grass is replaced with synthetic turf, which some also worry could ooze toxic substances. But c'mon. This debate has been going in circles for two years. An environmental impact report costing almost $1 million found no significant health risk. And it's not as if the idea is to tear up pristine parkland - those are already soccer fields - the idea is just to put in synthetic turf.
One of the main acts is Janice Martin, billed as the world's only aerial violinist. She soars above the stage exhibiting aerial acrobatics while hitting more than a few high notes on her violin.

She also sings, plays the piano and endears herself to the audience.

Still, conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America are urging lawmakers to reject Ex-Im Bank reauthorization and have made it a "key vote" in how they rate lawmakers' records.

In six starts there, Harang is 2-2 but has a 6.40 ERA (23 earned runs, 32 1/3 innings). Harang gave up a run in the first when Marco Scutaro led off with a double, moved to third and scored on two ground outs. After Scutaro's hit, Harang retired nine straight batters, including four in a row on strikeouts before the Rockies struck for three runs in the fourth.
Back on "Hill Street," Sgt. Phil Esterhaus would end each morning briefing session with the words, "Hey, let's be careful out there." In creating "NYC 22," though, some very talented people have been perhaps too careful. What's needed is a little more courage and a lot more original thinking.

But Jefferson's situation is far more complicated.

At Jamie's suggestion, I closed all the window ventilation louvers on the ocean side of the house and when I went to bed, shut the door of my bedroom.
