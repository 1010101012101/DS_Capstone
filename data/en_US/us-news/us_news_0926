Perhaps our narrative habits of mind explain our inability to accept Shapiro's consistently untitled sculptures as abstract. Any given piece by him will show its abstract sides as we circle it.

She estimated that the district has been involved with the program for about 20 years.
Some parents have signaled concern about privacy, The Oregonian's Wendy Owen reports. Everything typed online using Google Apps will be possessed forever by Google in remote servers, known poetically as "the cloud." Google is bound by its contract with Oregon not to access a student's essays, science notes, math worksheets, or emails -- and there is no cause to doubt the data's security just as there is little reason to believe a hacker would ever want to know what ninth-graders really think of "Macbeth."

Cook's notes: If using shiitake mushrooms, discard the woody stems before chopping. To keep the lettuce leaves intact, remove the core first; the leaves should then separate more easily.
In "'There Are Things I Want You to Know' About Stieg Larsson and Me," Gabrielsson tells her story. Unfortunately, the slim volume reads more like a court defense and less, as one might hope, as a remembrance of a writer whom millions of readers have come to love but know precious little about.

But his influence reaches beyond sales and prizes. The author, who has never held or sought political office, has become a kind of wise man in Washington. According to Ron Suskind's best-selling "Confidence Men," Democratic senators read Caro's books as they attempted to pass health care legislation in 2009 and Rep. Barney Frank consulted "Master of the Senate," which covered Johnson's dominating run as Senate majority leader, as he urged fellow Democrats to support new financial regulation. President Obama has met at the White House with Caro and has said that "The Power Broker," Caro's Pulitzer winner about municipal builder Robert Moses, influenced his own political thinking.

An intense politician who wears her emotions in public, whether it was the angry glare she shot at South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson's "You lie" outburst at a presidential address or her unabashed ardor for Obama (mocked on a "Pop Up Pelosi" YouTube video), Pelosi is easy to caricature and demonize. She lacks charisma. Her speaking style, muddied by tangents, is panned.

That is, the rack itself, an all-in-one gym foldable into countless configurations, is a gimmick, albeit a useful one, a tool no better or worse than the good, old-fashioned chin-up bars and free-weights it replaces.

Relaxation segments feature pastoral settings (often including a dog lying down) and gentle piano music. Exposure segments tend to show dogs dealing with stressors such as a vacuum cleaner.
Still, the number of E. coli food poisoning cases has dropped in the United States since 1994, when O157:H7 was declared an adulterant by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But other deadly strains of E. coli -- like the one in Germany -- have emerged. While they differ, all produce shiga toxins. According to the most recent data collected by the CDC, more people were sickened in 2010 from six strains of non-O157 shiga-toxin producing E. coli than from O157.

Most eggs are now produced by hens kept in "barren battery cages," which house up to eight hens, with each cage having about 67 square inches for the hens to live their entire lives.

But friends and relatives of Facts said Rep. West's claim that dozens of Democratic politicians are communists was simply too much for the aging concept to overcome.
State Police Major Matt Wilson said the case is a reminder to safeguard the integrity of government institutions, particularly law enforcement. "This is not a celebration. There is no large cache of weapons or drugs seized that is sometimes symbolic that the world if just a little bit safer," he said.

Your lawyer thinks this is an example of "bad parenting" but not "felony criminal conduct." You know what's considered bad parenting in my book? Letting your child run around barefoot inside a grocery store. Those floors are disgusting and little feet deserve to be respected. What you've done is absolutely criminal and you're lucky things didn't turn out differently, because instead of being charged with felony child endangerment you could have been charged with murder.
Insert a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the tenderloin and be sure the thermometer is not hitting an oven coil. Remove the meat when the temperature is 8 to 10 degrees less than the temperature desired, as it will continue to cook once removed. It will take approximately one hour to sear and bake a 4-pound beef tenderloin in the oven. We tend to cook our tenderloin to approximately 140 degrees for medium, and 135 degrees for medium-rare. Remove the meat from the oven or grill and let rest uncovered for 10 minutes. The temperature will rise and the juices from the meat will redistribute. Slice in -inch-thick pieces and pass the sauce of your choice separately.

This goes beyond the Giants, too. If the Packers won that game, it might have been Brett Favre vanquishing the unbeaten Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. And even if he didn’t win that game, could the Packers have let their quarterback legend -- who retired and unretired that offseason -- leave town just months after a Super Bowl appearance?

But many analysts say the recent data are flawed. They say the data suggest American drivers this year, based on the average of weekly figures, have cut back at the pump by 622,900 barrels a day from a year ago, the equivalent of Argentina's entire daily consumption. The U.S. economy is gaining steam, they argue—nonfarm payrolls rose 1.6% in February—and while high gas prices probably are eroding demand, it wouldn't be by that much.

Sen. John Sullivan was voted best Democratic state senator. Sullivan is from Rushville, a little town in "Forgottonia," otherwise known as Western Illinois. His conservatism often puts him more in line with his Republican colleagues (a zero percent rating from Planned Parenthood, endorsed by the NRA), and he regularly works with the other side. Sullivan hasn't convinced any Republicans to vote for his plan to float bonds to pay off past-due state bills, and the GOP will undoubtedly use that legislation against him this November. But his struggle to find a tiny bit of bipartisan consensus impressed my commenters, and impressed me as well.

The goal is to build a wide insert with a low ceiling that will concentrate the heat when baking. It should be wide enough to easily slide a pizza onto the base using a pizza peel or inverted cookie sheet (allow at least an inch on either side, so 14 to 16 inches wide for a 10- to 12-inch pizza), and shallow enough to make the most of the concentrated heat (allowing 4 to 6 inches of vertical clearance).
Despite time on the road, all of the pizzas arrived hot and looking good.

Answer: As bad as the economy has been, there are a few pockets that have not shown any weakness. The shoe business is one of them, particularly women's shoes. They'll hold off buying blouses and dresses, but they'll spend money on denim and they'll spend money on shoes. In the shoe business, we like Steve Madden, and the old favorite, Crocs, has had a real resurgence. They've right-sized that company and have taken a lot of their sales overseas.

So, too, does Mr. Falls's production, a masterpiece of simplicity played out on a not-quite-naturalistic set (bravo, Kevin Depinet) that avoids mere picturesqueness in favor of evocative truth. Briskly paced and staged with proper attention to the humor without which the play can grind to a painful halt, this "Iceman" puts the author, not the director, in the spotlight. No overweeningly high concept has been imposed on the script. Instead we see it plain, enacted as a series of unostentatious tableaux that Natasha Katz has lighted with a Rembrandt-like feel for chiaroscuro.

The scout sent a batch of recruiting info to Oregon to justify his fee, but the info was borderline useless -- names and number of players who in some cases were already playing at other colleges. Chip Kelly hasn't sufficiently explained how that happened, because he can't sufficiently explain how that happened.

The wonder of Anne Tyler is how consistently clear-eyed and truthful she remains about the nature of families and especially marriage. Courageous enough to pick up where most other novelists leave off — after the vows have been exchanged — Tyler understands that crisis comes in many forms and that relationships between people are both sacred and often doomed. Because love, though necessary, is by its very nature imperfect. Without love, we live in darkness, but its discovery does not guarantee happiness; in fact, it often precludes it. Which is the great irony of life — that which brings the greatest pleasure, brings the greatest pain. A domestic problem, yes, but as epic as they come.

Ohio privacy laws have not been substantially updated since the 1970s, leaving very little protection for residents. Technology has far outpaced our laws, and issues that were never considered 40 years ago now pose serious threats to our personal freedom.

"Smash," which will occupy the 10 p.m. slot, has good buzz from critics. While critical acclaim certainly helps, kind words are far from a guarantee of strong ratings, particularly for a show that was conceived with a cable sensibility. The NBC show will have to draw an audience far bigger on broadcast than required in the niche world of cable where even a viewership of several million can be considered a rousing success.

In fact, since becoming a mother, one of the biggest factors in my wardrobe selection has involved the answer to this question: Is it clean?

Legislators need to get busy, as well: Ex-felons shouldn't be allowed to set up or run pain-management clinics -- termed "pill mills" by their critics. And pain clinics, which can both prescribe and sell drugs, need tighter regulation. The goal should be to make sure that only people who legitimately need painkillers get them.

I'm looking forward to how it's going to be faster and I feel like that's something to be worried about too. I'm going to have to adjust to that, but I feel like it's a whole different game. It's going to be more exciting having a lot more fans coming to the games, because we don't have that many. Having a new set of coaches is going to be cool. I'm especially excited to be coached by Caitlyn McFadden. She was so great at Maryland.

Lining the iron fence along busy Ninth Street, hundreds of yellow, white and purple Douglas irises catch commuters' eyes. Bush anemones, barberry and fragrant Sonoma sage buzz with hard-working bees.
As a director, Woolf is preoccupied with questions of intimacy. The plays he chooses to direct himself (surely one of the great advantages of being AD at a good-sized theater) again and again involve people crawling into one another's lives. Wittingly or not, welcome or not, they bulldoze barriers of self-protection and self-definition. They destroy each other or open each other up. Mostly, they don't even think about the consequences. In Woolf's work, the drive for intimacy is as great as the need for food or water. His characters just can't live without it.
But what about those who complain that Lugar hasn't represented the conservative line well enough? That, Daniels said, is ridiculous.

The days when East St. Louis was still known as an industrial hub.
Judges were told the varietal or style of each wine, but not the appellation, producer or vintage. Later, they learned that one winery had three best-of-class wines in the running for sweepstakes consideration. Though none of the three won any of the high honors, the nominations alone made for an impressive showing by a winery that not only was one of the smaller producers in the judging but also from a region still not as esteemed as Napa, Sonoma and Paso Robles in the minds of wine enthusiasts.
MLS achieves a certain legitimacy in appearing on some big boards in Vegas alongside the NBA and NFL. But in its orchestrated fan experience, soccer will always be different from those sports. That is its blessing and its burden.

I go back and forth between Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life" and Lars von Trier's "Melancholia" as my favorite film of the year, largely depending upon the lightness and darkness of my mood. Both films shift between the human-scale drama of family and grander visions of the world, "Tree of Life" visualizing the origins of the universe while "Melancholia" imagines a crashing, crushing apocalypse.
Finally, Gerry thought, why not just keep making our old monthly mortgage payment? By tacking an extra $395 principal payment onto our $805 monthly mortgage nut, we'd shave six years off our 20-year loan term and save $16,535 in interest.

At the memorial service in July, about a hundred people attended – Kelly's relatives from near and far, friends from high school and elementary school, and many of the homeless who hang out at the Fullerton bus depot. At the entrance, a poster board of pictures retraced Kelly's life, from a redheaded baby kissing his mom to a now-iconic image of him standing, smoking a cigarette, his hair blowing in the wind at the Fullerton bus depot.

Twenty-five years later, they still have not met, nor do they seem inclined to -- although given Weschler's sense of the universe as chaotic and determined, that may be for the best. "It was literally the case last week," he says, "that Irwin and Hockney were both in New York at the same time and I knew they were a block away from each other.

The lawsuits, which were eventually consolidated into the federal case in Oakland, contend the alleged agreement kept the prices to rent and buy DVDs much higher than they otherwise would have been.

Easy distinctions between poetry and prose fail the prose poems of Christopher Kennedy's fourth book, which allow all the pleasure we ask of poetry and none of the prosaicness of prose.

"It's no wonder that we move differently in the dark," he writes, and his poems are often worthy of wonder. Grade: B

The You Docs believe in eating the amount of food that feels right — but only when your diet is based on lean proteins and unsaturated fats, lots of veggies and fruit, and 100 percent whole grains (and no refined ones!).

You'll be able to tell those good-for-you calories you're eating, "Burn baby, burn!"
