The challenge now before the Supreme Court was brought by an applicant who failed to secure one of those places. Among other things, she argues that Texas' "top 10%" policy produced enough racial diversity to make additional consideration of race inappropriate.

The voters have spoken on the Howard County Board of Education, though what they said is perhaps open to interpretation. One newcomer who promises to shake things up won big, as did a couple of other newcomers who also ran as outsiders. But two incumbents who are both part of the establishment also won big, while the third incumbent, the ultimate outsider, lost. And then there's the unpleasant reality that so few of the voters bothered to make their voices heard at all, a weak turnout that was not unexpected but which makes reading too much into the results risky.

For a while now, Portland has been incubating a very alternative puppet scene, where all sorts of people are pushing the boundaries of what puppetry means.

Another common form of dementia is vascular dementia. It is typically caused by brain injury from hardening of the arteries that causes strokes, or other diseases that affect blood vessel function. This condition worsens in a stepwise fashion and the affected person may not be aware that these small strokes are occurring.

Unlike Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia in many patients can be prevented with early detection and treatment.

Scott Walker's clash with public-employee unions last year, asking, "Do you agree government unions are being too greedy?"
A sense of urgency is on display daily at the school. In recent months, I've been struck repeatedly by the academic rigor in classrooms and the passion displayed by so many teachers who expect their students to excel. Staff members arrive each morning committed to the mission of Project Restore, which centers on a more challenging curriculum, a demanding testing program and stricter discipline.
While this may take some time (give yourself at least a couple of hours), the rewards are worth it: a closet of items you love and wear.
Shaver says the Strike Force has been doing in-depth investigations, but adds, "They should look at the opportunity to do a few more long term cases. We have limited resources. If you do more long term investigations, it might mean less on-the-street activities."
She said she had lunged toward Coleman, and heard a gun go off before the men ran. She had been shot five times, Koenig at least twice. Stallis was shot through the cheek by a slug that then entered her chest and killed her.
In many ways, Superman is still the same ride, but the experience is entirely new. The old forward launch always seemed like a mad rush toward a brick wall, only to be propelled skyward at the last possible moment. The new backward launch saves the best thrills for the second half of the ride, like a plane zooming toward Earth only to pull out of the dive just before smashing into the ground.
A Democratic assemblyman claims it costs some commuters more to drive to work every day than they pay in New Jersey income taxes.
Criticism poured in from students, employees and politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown, who expressed disbelief that the trustees felt they had to pay a salary "twice that of the chief justice of the United States."
TRENTON — A bill designed to combat the recreational use of human growth hormone, particularly among New Jersey’s law enforcement officers and firefighters, won easy approval in the Assembly today.

So, even after Terry’s death, the administration was still pushing the lie that the primary source of Mexico’s gun violence was American arms dealers — and covering its own rear end.
"While they're in jail, guess who's paying for it? We are. Why should we?" Schaefer asked. "I have no animosity - now that I know what the hell happened."
Utah State's Robert Turbin is another intriguing back because he certainly has the look and the lower-body power that running back coaches covet. He has missed almost two full seasons with injuries — a torn ACL in 2010 and a foot injury in 2007 — but he ran for 1,296 yards in 2009 and 1,517 last season.
Thais have a wink-and-smirk reaction to the sex trade, a billion-dollar industry that draws tourists from around the world. Thais have had a long- standing appreciation for foreigners, even giving Europeans a special name, "Farang." The accommodating style also gave birth to the sex industry during the Vietnam War, when go-go bars first sprouted up in the Patpong district to service the American military.
To calculate each participant's soda intake, participants answered a series of food-frequency questionnaires over the course of the study. Those questions included how often, on average, during the previous year the participant had consumed one glass, bottle or can of soda.

None of those items made it into the final bill. A better-organized and better-funded airline industry exploited those internal divisions, and in the end, that hurt consumers.
Did MU officials overestimate Delany's flirtations as a sincere offer, or did Delany intentionally oversell and misrepresent the Big Ten's interest in Missouri to serve his own interests?
The Tar Heels showed their age with ragged play for long stretches in the second half of tonight’s Sweet 16 game but had the 81-63 victory well in hand after overwhelming Marquette with a first-half display (and 40-15 lead) that was as impressive as it gets at this point of the season.

Wheat's case is not unique, a DOC attorney told the judge. Many offenders since the law was enacted in 1993 have achieved college degrees by incorporating college credits earned in the past. The law has never been modified to mandate anything different.
"That's where American policing was falling down on the job," William J. Bratton, who implemented the broken windows theory with dramatic success during his tenures as police chief in New York in the 1990s and Los Angeles in the 2000s, said in an interview Friday. "Jim Wilson and George Kelling reshaped the way law enforcement thought about its role and staunchly defended the idea of proactive policing that focuses not only on preventing crime but disorder."
Don't look for the new site, done in persimmon walls and dark wood, to offer the additional Malaysian menu carried in Cleveland Heights. Co-owner and founder, Freeman Ngo, a former Singaporean, doesn't have the space for it, but hopes to offer it in a Solon location by the end of the year.

The deal they struck will allow tribal casinos to take simulcast wagers on horse racing. It also allows the card clubs at Canterbury and Running Aces Harness Park to add tables, raise wagering limits on poker and host larger and more frequent poker tournaments. All those things will generate additional purse funds, creating more incentive to breed racehorses in Minnesota.
Traditionally in the ER, care is driven by the chief complaint, said UH emergency room nurse manager Danielle Zemek.
David Stern. It hasn’t been a great few months for Stern. He did not have the same grip over his owners that he has had in the past, he certainly didn’t come off well publicly, and he has now overseen three lockouts in his last four collective-bargaining negotiations. But make no mistake, Stern got his owners 75-80 percent of what they were looking for in this deal, and if he had to take some public battering to do so, well, that’s part of the job.
The banner had hung outside the stadium since its opening in 2008. After Manning was released March 7, the team added the words "Thank you Peyton" to the banner. Many credit Manning for helping to secure funding for the new stadium. A large banner also hung outside the RCA Dome before the team moved to Lucas Oil.
And yes, he has heard the comparisons to famously controlling Beach Boys singer Brian Wilson, who also heard fully formed pop anthems in his head.

By signing Crawford, the team would need to have the mid-level exception, which is afforded to teams under the league’s tax threshold.

Friday was the deadline for teams to use amnesty this season.

On March 1, 1969, Mickey Mantle retired. In his retirement speech, he noted "I can't see the ball anymore. I can't steal second when I need to anymore. I can't go from first to third anymore, and I think it's time to quit trying." Even his retirement came with conspiracy theories, as there are some who believe that since the Players Assn. considered a strike for the 1969 season, they wanted Mantle to be part of the group of striking players. So when the strike did not materialize, Mantle could retire in peace. I doubt that's true, but it's interesting to note how many tall tales follow Mantle around.
Even after the time spent sexting Kelly, followed by a booming silence, Di Toro has hidden behind a veil of anonymity that Kelly, a totally innocent man, was never afforded.
Mole poblano, with a sauce blending several kinds of chile, herbs and spices, sesame and other seeds, nuts, chocolate and about 30 other ingredients, could have made Puebla the country’s culinary capital all on its own. But chiles en nogada, created in 1821 to honor Augustín de Iturbide for his role in the War of Independence, is every bit as ambrosial and has patriotism on its side. Large, mild poblano chiles stuffed with ground meat, fruit, nuts and spices are covered with a silky sauce of cream, cheese and ground walnuts, garnished with pomegranate seeds: The red, white and green colors represent the nation’s new flag. Try it in August and September, when pomegranates are in season, at Casa de los Muñecos.

"Forget about being a Tiger Mom or employee of the month," suggests Marcelo, who says she's embraced "managed chaos," as she calls it. Do it all? No. Have it all? Maybe.
I reported a column recently that featured the longtime struggles in football at Parkrose High School. It's a program that didn't win a single league game over a 12-year span, but the kids there are so determined, they refuse to quit. I noted in reporting the piece that children too often look for reasons to give up. Adults, too. And it feels more and more like hope and faith are too often lost in the exchange of everyday life.

Weaver's only walk came with two outs in the seventh inning, to Josh Willingham. In the second inning, Chris Parmelee reached base after a dropped third strike.
With this past weekend’s toll hikes for the Port Authority’s bridge and tunnel crossings, New Jersey commuters will begin to bear the unfair burden of funding road improvements all across the state. This inequity is the result of Gov. Chris Christie’s failure to provide stable funding for New Jersey’s Transportation Trust Fund to maintain our roads and bridges. Instead, the governor is creating more debt and asking northern New Jersey commuters to shoulder far more than their fair share.

“At our practice facility we really have a championship atmosphere, and we’re really a reflection of that,” said Dooling. “We all have roles on this team, and (talking to the younger players is) kind of my role. It’s been that way all year. In the playoffs it gets magnified. We just want to lock in and encourage our teammates. No one really gave us this game on paper without Rondo, so we looked at it as a chance to step up again, and somebody did it again. We love stepping up to the plate.
Like Gilyeat, leading lady Maddy Clapps has a clean, pure singing voice that is charming to hear, but on the acting side, she seems to have put more effort into her genteel English accent than into developing Jane's personality. The flirtation between the two stars is strictly pro-forma.

The arguments against male circumcision are that it is unnecessary, doesn't markedly affect the health of men or women in developed countries and can lead to serious complications, rare but possible. The actual complication rate is 0.2 percent to 0.6 percent, and most of the complications are minor. Furthermore, some feel strongly that it is a mutilating procedure. It is not on a par with female circumcision.

The opposition to "Hillarycare" from Republicans was ferocious, just like their opposition to Obamacare more recently — and in the Clinton case, the opposition was successful.

Gingrich's goodbye ends a wild ride that began about a year ago. In June, his campaign manager and much of his senior staff quit, after Gingrich and his wife took a cruise to the Greek Isles rather than hitting the campaign trail as the race intensified. Yet Gingrich kept fighting, relying largely on the goodwill of Republicans around the country who fondly remembered how he engineered the 1994 House victories that gave the GOP control of the chamber for the first time in 40 years.

On the other hand, huge swaths of many people's online world today didn't even yet exist.

Read the labels on different tubes of caulk, and try to find one that says it has the least amount of shrinkage.

Gates announced the Pentagon's decision to lift the complete ban on video and photos of the return of fallen troops to domestic soil. The ban, dating back to the 1991 Persian Gulf War, covers the transfer of flag-draped caskets at Delaware's Dover Air Force Base, the first U.S. stop en route to the final resting place for deceased military personnel.

I put more than 300 miles on a platinum-silver, $63,349 test car in one day and found it to be, as a piece of high-speed internodal transit, quite competent: roomy and yet still intimate, with an almost Tantric quiet in the cabin and the gliding, frictionless ride quality of a prosthetic hip. Between the blind-spot monitoring system, the active lane-keeping, the adaptive cruise control (maintaining a set distance to the vehicle ahead), and the "precollision" system, which uses internal cameras to monitor drivers' faces for signs of inattention, the GS350 is about as close to an automated auto as you'll find on the market.

Now, Wetcharat is slightly overweight and no longer a lithe teenager. The club's mamasan won't allow her on stage with the others, who range in age from 17 to the early 20s. Instead, the cheery Wetcharat serves drinks, flirts with customers and sets up dates for the others. She makes about $200 a month and sends most of it home to her parents, who don't know she works in the sex business. If she finds a "date," Wetcharat can earn $200 for one night.

But that poll found Obama's slim leads tenuous.

Heck, he even looks like Elway in some respects.

And the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded in 2003 that while the use of "tocolytic drugs" such as terbutaline can forestall childbirth by two to seven days, babies fare no better when it is used. Neither emergency nor long-term preventive use of such drugs "should be undertaken as a general practice," ACOG concluded. And the FDA said that in spite of its past efforts to warn physicians of the dangers of terbutaline's use, "prolonged use of terbutaline continues, with serious and sometimes fatal consequences."
