They're still medical facilities, and they won't be as familiar -- or as private -- as your home.

Some things about the Vatican report do leave me torn: I can't, for instance, decide if my favorite part is where they dare to indict the sisters for silence on abortion since, if memory serves, the Vatican itself has now and again been accused of keeping quiet when it shouldn't have been. Or maybe it's where they describe one sister's language about "moving beyond the Church" as "a cry for help."

This year, as I look to build a middle school schedule, I again survey a litany of poor choices and questions with ugly answers. Do I cut Band? Do I cut Shop? Maybe Yearbook or Spanish? Do I put 40 students in core classes? (They are currently at 35 on average.) Can I find smaller desks and tables or bigger classrooms to fit more students? Which classified employees am I going to cut hours? How will this affect various student groups? How can I cut another 5 percent off our building budget when we've been cut 25 percent already? Can we teach classes without paper to save costs? Can we turn off some lights and recycle more to save money?

He told me he was going to do everything he could to come back here," said Holliday, who signed his franchise-record deal the same winter in which the club pledged but ultimately failed to engage Pujols in talks about an extension. "There was never any weird dynamic between us. I thought our relationship was super strong and still is. I never believed there was any awkwardness based on my contract. That perception is totally inaccurate."

"Their portfolio of parks is the cream of the crop," he said. "Cedar Point is just about every year named the best amusement park in the country, if not the world." Cedar Fair parks offer strong cash flow, even without new growth, Spiegel said.
At times it takes a crisis, such as being threatened with eviction because their apartment is unsafe or divorce because a spouse is fed up with the mess, before hoarders seek help. The first step toward treatment is often "harm reduction" - clean up enough of the clutter to resolve the immediate crisis and deal with long-term recovery later, said Turner.

Cage's music holds the ear's attention at first, but with no beginning, middle or end, it's all middle, all ambience, and doesn't go deeper than the first couple of minutes. It has no urgency, no personality. A single note or noise is an event, incapable of development. Very in the moment.

We were shocked when they told us. We had some idea of a range of when she might go home, but we never expected it to be that soon. She was just doing so well. When they said, "She'll be discharged tomorrow," we didn't even have car seat installed or sheets for her bassinette. I was really terrified. They did a "car seat test" in the NICU to make sure she could sit up in the car seat and not slump to interfere with her breathing, and she passed it. Needless to say the drive home was nerve-wracking.

The report onIran'srefusal to negotiate about its nuclear program is misleading ("Iran defiant in response to EU's boycott of its oil," Jan. 24). Iran's "unwillingness to negotiate" is belied by the fact that Iran negotiated with the U.S. long before the implementation of sanctions ostensibly designed to force it back to the bargaining table.

Men can "geek out" when it comes to construction and even minutia of a garment. "I'm not just talking about a 'fashion guy.' For many men, your wardrobe is part of your program of discernment. They'll learn about it like a car or a wine or a watch," Thoreson says. "Guys can be busting each other's chops in one breath and talking about soft construction on the shoulder of a suit in the next. They love construction, specs. It's about what's under the hood."

The makers of Muscle Milk made a valid argument in the statement that echoed a complaint that the dairy lobby has made in the past: "Soy milk," "almond milk," "rice milk" and "coconut milk" products don't have any milk in them either, yet producers are allowed to use the word "milk." Not having dairy is, of course, part of their attraction to those who don't like, or can't drink, cow's milk.
For three decades, Robert A. Rosenbaum helped guide established companies and fresh startups through complex challenges.
E-commerce has come to revolve around account user names based on a valid e-mail address, and most consumers aren't aware of the inherent risk that that arrangement engenders.

The charts and notes that Duncan kept showing where each batter hit various pitches were used to help set the shortstop, or to guide the third baseman closer to the line. Late last season, Rafael Furcal's arrival to start at shortstop coincided with a spike in the defensive success David Freese had at third base. Coach Jose Oquendo said that was partially because with Furcal's range, La Russa could take the info from the scouting reports and arrange Freese in a different spot, one closer to the line that played to his strengths. In past years, when it looks like Skip Schumaker had the lefthanded hitter played perfectly for the double play, he got there partially because of Duncan's books.
A perfectly cooked bone-in rib-eye with rich red-wine butter proved they were perfectly capable of nailing a big-time steak house slab (18 ounces for $39) from the “primal cuts” section of the menu. I’m just not sure what anyone’s supposed to do with a garnish as ridiculous as a single half of a brussels sprout. A rich and gamy cut of culotte steak, paired with house-made frites and an herbaceous smudge of chimichurri, wasn’t perfect, but it was generously portioned, and a good example of the slightly more affordable, bistro-style plates being served in Paramour’s expansive bar, where Kobe sliders, flatbreads, and chopped entree salads are served to a room fitted with a cozy row of cloistered half-moon booths that could become a coveted destination for an intimate bite with a “friend.”

While Sadler was enroute to the scene, he received another call from a witness who reported that the suspect had spun out of control while leaving the parking lot of the business park and rolled the stolen vehicle.
And it was a balanced, highlight-filled offensive night, too. The Blazers finished with 29 assists -- recording one on 76 percent of their field goals -- and blended an effective uptempo pace with their typical halfcourt offense.
Once vascular dementia develops, treatment options are limited. Drugs available for Alzheimer's are sometimes prescribed, but offer at best temporary and modest protection of cognition.
"Our cities are growing," Ramos said. "It's going to be very difficult to accommodate future growth with our existing transportation system."
Jorge says: “The Giants' pass rush — from its NASCAR package to its phantom pressure — will make Tom Brady uncomfortable as has been the case the last two times these teams have met. On the other side, Eli Manning won't have trouble picking apart a Patriots defense that struggled against Joe Flacco in the AFC Championship Game to lead the Giants to their second title in five years – and leave the Patriots without one since 2004.”
And so, as a decade draws to a close, it feels natural to put the history of the art, briefly, in reverse.
CBS conducts lots of research of its own to harvest viewer feedback, notes David Poltrack, the network's chief research officer. But as a Bluefin client, CBS recognizes that what is unique about the feedback Bluefin crunches "is the volume of responses: It is ongoing, in a continuous stream," Poltrack says. "The question that is still to be resolved: How representative is that feedback? Only 10 or 15 percent of the population uses Twitter. Is the Twitter audience representative of the other 85 percent?"

Increasing jobs and getting Missourians back to work is a bi-partisan priority. Unfortunately, many available jobs pay low wages. Some parents are only able to work because they have subsidized child care that picks up a portion of the costs of care for their children while they work. Missouri has never provided generous subsidies for parents. If the Senate proposal becomes reality, Missouri will sink to 50th, with the lowest eligibility of any state. Lowering eligibility for subsidized care is counter-productive to getting people to work.
Simmons said band members still have a lot of questions about what will happen to the program, but she said they were told that Jamboree might be canceled.
"When I look at the light at the end of the tunnel, it's no longer a regional rail train coming at me, it's a way out," he said with a laugh. "It's a tremendous blessing to all of us."

Mills leads the team with 6 assists (tying his career high) and is tied for the lead in rebounds (along with Wesley Matthews) with 3.
Even the central figure in the book, Madden, shows little interest in taking the bait about all this rogue-Raiders stuff. Not surprisingly, the guy who coached that bunch and then moved on to a successful career as a TV analyst and namesake of a computer game would rather talk about football. "The further you get away from the '70s, the more of the lore you hear," he says. "But the truth is that we had a great core of very strong individuals, and if we had some guys who were a little off, they were the periphery."
Good day to everyone ...

Ohio State University professor Daniel Tokaji, an election law expert, called the newly released map "as partisan a gerrymander as we are likely to see anywhere in the country."

Ariz. employees: 1,381.
It's the second such motion in the past three weeks by the prosecutor's office seeking a significant bail increase on an illegal alien, to keep the defendant held in the Morris County jail instead of possibly posting bail and being turned over to the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and deported. That's what happened in December when an illegal alien in an unrelated case posted bail and was picked up by ICE, and then consented to deportation before his local criminal case was resolved.

A reception and banquet followed the parade but that wasn't the only celebrating that evening. The Graham Guardian said, "An inaugural ball was held on the public streets in which thousands of joyous Arizonans participated."
A: (Laughs.) Well there are a number of reasons for that. There's an honorable tradition of Brits, isn't there, of playing bad guys, whether it's Anthony Hopkins, Jeremy Irons, Alan Rickman, even Gary Oldman. There's a sort of a path to Hollywood for British actors that seems to involve playing a bad guy.
"I think we are always a balanced team, and that's our goal every game," Elmendorf said. "The thing that we really like about our team is that there are a lot of games where we have a different leading scorer. That's great."

Though the two devoted a lot of energy to working, they were also easygoing, say friends.

And now Pitt may be swinging for the fences on Oscar night in the lead actor category. He seems to be a lock for that nomination, considering those early nods he's already collected for his "Moneyball" work as Billy Beane, the real-life maverick general manager of the Oakland A's who fought Major League Baseball resistance to his reliance on traditionally overlooked stats in team-building. Pitt the producer may also hear his name called out in the best picture category if the upstart film makes that final cut.

Vohden said he and "98 percent" of the others in the association were looking for information on how the Highlands Act would affect landowners, not actually seeking to overturn it. Only the "core group" that had founded the organization wanted to repeal the law, he said.
What Roberts really wants to do is just play football and help Lafayette return to winning ways. The Leopards have gone 6-16 over the last two seasons after not having a losing season since 2003.
Thomas writes: "There are 328 foreclosures in all of Orange County, a drop of 64 in the past two weeks. The inventory started the year with 620. The foreclosure inventory has not been this low since October 2009. The expected market time is 0.7 months, almost untouchable for a buyer unless they come to compete. Short sales have become almost as hot as foreclosures. After shedding 164 homes in the past two weeks, the short sale inventory now totals 1,274, levels not seen since the distressed inventory began to rise in 2007. The expected market time for short sales is 0.9 months, a very hot sellers market. The short sale process is improving, but only slightly, almost undetectable to the untrained eye. They still take a long time to put together and the more complex the short sale (multiple lenders, delinquent HOA dues, unpaid property taxes, liens against the title), the longer it takes to put together. Distressed properties now represent 25 percent of the overall active inventory versus 35 percent one year ago."
Now, they’ll have their opportunity for revenge -- and, thanks to Britain and France, the weapons to do it. Despite the calls from the Transitional Council not to seek retribution in the streets of Tripoli, out in the hinterlands too many will think old scores must be settled in blood.

Pro-Football-Reference.com had an amazing statistic: Since 1960, only 71 quarterbacks had passed for more than 300 yards with four touchdowns and a passer rating of 140.0 or higher. All 71 had played for the winning team — until Romo, that is, became No. 72 and lost to the Giants.

Finding real-life alternatives to plastic bags for Portlanders shouldn't be reduced to a race to the first headline; it should be elevated to a well-thought-out plan to change people's behavior in favor of the environment.

The Federal Communications Commission announced this week that it would seek to block a promising new wireless venture by the Virginia company LightSquared because of the interference it caused with Global Positioning System signals.

"He had his forearm cut," coach Mike Babcock said. "We don't know, that's why he's at the hospital - we don't know to what extent, or how severe, if any tendons or anything like that are cut.
