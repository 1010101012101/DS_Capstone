More important, perhaps, all the candidates played virtually no role in the uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak’s despotic regime — but, paradoxically, that, too, might not be a bad thing.

El Paso, Texas, for example, sits across the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez, the epicenter of cartel violence in Mexico. Yet its violent crime rate in 2010, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, was one-quarter of the national average for cities its size, and less than half the rate for all of Texas. El Paso is also home to aU.S. Army base and several law enforcement headquarters, which may help stem crime. But other Texas border towns also have lower-than-expected crime rates.

DG: Yes. Dominican pitcher Victor De Leon, a hard-throwing righty, will likely appear in the Top 30 prospects when it hits bookstores later this offseason. He throws from 94-96 mph, and hit 98 mph, but his command was erratic at that velocity. He was a starter this year in the GCL. Breyvic Valera has a lot of fans within the organization and some outside of it, too. He hit .397/.430/.479 in a brief (19 game) appearance with Johnson City this past year. The switch-hitting Venezuelan infielder played shortstop but has the tools to really thrive at second base. He's an above-average runner with a nice line-drive swing and a nimble approach to fielding. Roberto De La Cruz, the high-dollar third baseman the Cardinals signed a few years ago, started to show more development (and, thus, more promise) this past year. According to an opposing manager, De La Cruz showed "real raw power" but he also had trouble with off-speed pitches. Another official said he was among the most improved players at Johnson City. Considering their investment, the Cardinals hope that's the case.

Both fresh and dried turmeric share a certain earthy quality and somewhat pungent spiciness. Fresh is milder and sweeter than dried, which can seem bitter and medicinal if too much is added. It's not often found in the spice cabinet, but ground turmeric can be a good adjunct when added with a light hand to soups, stews and chutneys. Like any spice, ground turmeric will gradually lose aroma, color and flavor, so is best stored in a cool, dry, dark cabinet and used within a year or so of purchase. Discard it when the color and aroma fade.

Just as Mr. Jafarzadeh openly sides with the exiled Iranian terrorist group Mujahedin-e Khalq, Mr. Chalibi lived in London while leading an umbrella Iraqi opposition group (the Iraqi National Congress) pushing for U.S. militaryintervention to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime. Among many illicit activities, including financial fraud, the INC provided gullible senior U.S. government officials and pundits with fabricated and bogus intelligence reports concerning Iraq's (non-existent) WMD programs. Mr. Jafarzadeh's unsubstantiated allegations from an exiled group with a self-serving political agenda stand in direct contrast to the official assessment of the U.S. intelligence community that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons.

Terroir is obviously defined by what the animals eat, mainly the grass that grows naturally in the farm’s pastures.

Jamila, who began her career at age 16 as an acrobatic dance for Ringling Brothers Circus, had by then created a "fascinating dance village of live music, belly dancers, snakes, swords and tattoos." Asia saw this and fell in love with both the music and the dance. She never got on that plane to New York. Instead she went on her own journey of Middle Eastern dance and music, always taking her audiences on a whirling, choreographed tour of ancient culture, ritual and mythology, a tour that sometimes includes a dance with a snake, or blades, or balanced candles. Come Saturday night, Asia and Arabesque will introduce women who danced by the sword to women who dance for the soul.

When I got the job offer, Donna and I came out to Cleveland for a weekend visit to look around and stayed at the Stouffer (now Renaissance) Hotel. The downtown was coming alive and we realized that the suburbs had always been great places to raise a family. Our daughter grew up here, and I'm so proud of her.

The Obamas are setting a terrible example for today’s young people, and threatening the taxpayers with having to foot that bill.
