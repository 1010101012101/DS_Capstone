To prepare for Illinois' probable plunge into insolvency, read "Freedom to Fail: The Keystone of American Federalism" by Paul E. Peterson and Daniel Nadler in the University of Chicago Law Review. They note that only 25 of the world's 193 nations have federal systems, and in most of the 25 the freedom of the lower tiers of government is more circumscribed by the central government than American state governments are by the federal government. American states' greater freedom -- autonomy under America's system of dual sovereignty -- from the central government's supervision requires that they be disciplined instead by the market for government bonds, and the real possibility of default.

But let me give you some context. As of the first of this month, about half of the budget was already spent. The state at January 31 had about $14 billion of unspent monies for the current fiscal year. Of that amount, $8 billion cannot be touched – by contract, as in the case of state employees or maintenance of effort for federal stimulus money; by constitutional requirement; by the terms of our bonds; or by law.

Essentially, telling this story involved reporting on scientists as they calculated a calculated risk. At stake: The health of Illinois waterways, one way or the other.

Joseph Stalin, when he wasn't purging, enjoyed musical comedies. In fact, he gave orders to his favorite filmmaker, Grigori Alexandrov, to make a series of Marx Brothersesque musicals that proved incredibly popular with the entertainment-starved Soviet populace. Shostakovich, whose works were being condemned by the cultural commissars in the early '30s, took note and was determined to create a surefire Stalinist hit with The Bright Stream.

What started as a destructive and chaotic week had a chance to end with some normalcy. And a chance to embrace some moral rectitude, for a change. In this myopic, insulated place — where it often seemed that football was all that mattered — that means acknowledging that it's not about football anymore. It's not about legacy. It's not even about their pride, though such a thing can be used for constructive purpose — and the initiatives they planned were too numerous to list, but expect to see 100,000 blue ribbons Saturday.
‘‘He is so smart, and he knows the game so well,'' Rush coach Bob McMillen said. ‘‘He knows where he's going with the ball and what kind of trajectory and arc he needs.

The hurried tone of early scenes abates with the appearance of Rowe's Diwata. From her first scene when she stages an online podcast entry of her diary, Rowe's Diwata playfully manifests all the eccentric excesses of a first-class drama queen.

In the first few years of the unit's existence, money wasn't an issue. The force had a fleet of leased vehicles and two office assistants to help with the paperwork. Ryan's team worked out of offices on University Avenue, and the conference room was so well equipped that other police agencies occasionally borrowed it.

Although he had an older brother, Bernard, and a sister, Alice, Vonnegut was often lonely as a child. His mainstay growing up was a black woman named Ida Young, the family cook.

It's no surprise then that the word "brut" seems to be vanishing from many bottles. But even that word no longer connotes the fully dry wine that it once represented. What we're likely seeing is the fizzy equivalent of the off-dry Chardonnay movement - somewhat sweet wines being marketed as dry.

Instead, you spent more time than you should have on the phone.

The woods are quiet and stately. At a grassy spot on the trail along the Des Plaines River, water softly burbles over rocks piled to guide the flow and provide nice riffles. All is serenity and peace, because although Ryerson is near the heavily used Des Plaines River Trail, it is not connected to it.

Such was the case with John D'Agata and Jim Fingal. In 2003, D'Agata penned a piece for the Believer about a young man's suicide in Las Vegas. When Fingal, then an intern at the magazine, was assigned to fact check, he found that D'Agata had fudged a number of details — everything from how many teenagers kill themselves in Nevada each year to how long it would take for a body to fall from the top of the Stratosphere casino. D'Agata objected to most changes, and an epic argument began that lasted until the piece was published in 2010. "The Lifespan of a Fact" offers D'Agata's work alongside his and Fingal's heated discussion of what truth is and when it matters.

Farm-raised goose meat has a firm, toothsome texture and lacks the expected gaminess, which is a pleasant relief to first-time tasters. I opted to cook our Chronicle holiday goose without stuffing and served it with an apple-based side dish. As the goose roasts, its all-dark meat is self-basted by rich fat, which helps moisten the meat. Repeated skin pricking is needed for the fat to drip off (the first set of pricks occasionally seal over), which you then baste over the skin for crispness. A 10- to 12-pound goose can give off up to 3 cups of fat, which can be strained and used to roast and saute vegetables.

øGreat for teaching kids logical thinking, "TwinGo!" is a series of puzzles about rolling two ball-shaped characters in tandem over an irregular floating grid. The two characters are the weather twins Fuyu and Natsu, who have somehow lost the stars that grace the sky. It is up to you to help the twins retrieve the missing stars by collecting three at a time in each of 90 puzzles spread over three unique worlds. The twins always move together; so if you roll one up one space, the other will do the same. But since the puzzles are played on irregular gridded platforms floating high in the sky, you have to be careful not to roll one twin off the edge of the platform while rolling the other over the star you are trying to collect. Walled spaces provide you the means of separating the twins and keeping them from rolling into game-ending oblivion. Cleverly, the game comes with an undo button, because these puzzles will take some trial-and-error before you will roll the twins onto the colored launch pads that send them careening to the next level. "TwinGo!" is a two-time treat for the whole family.

The measure, which was introduced in both the Ohio House and in the Senate, where Sen. Sue Morano of Lorain is a chief sponsor, comes on the heels of a recent controversy over whether the city misled the Ohio Department of Taxation in a prior application seeking a refund of property taxes paid on the land in 2008. The state approved an exemption for 2009 based on the application, while denying most of the 2008 refund request, but questions have been raised as to whether the stadium qualifies for such status. Resolution of the issue may swing on how the state defines the term "major league."

The markets needed the boost, because news out of Greece and Switzerland was particularly downbeat Thursday.
A: I don't think the Knicks have lost control, although I do think Amare Stoudemire did for one very regrettable moment. I think the Knicks, though, overstated themselves at the start of the series, when Amare and Baron Davis spoke of the teams being equals. No one in this series is the equal of LeBron James and while Amare might not agree, Chris Bosh is the best power forward in this series. The Knicks are a good team that got a bad draw. They needed the Pacers in the first round. They very well might have won that series.
Items that remain of concern to me:
We do object to legalizing indiscriminate usage on New Year's Eve. There are plenty of ways to ring in a new year without disrupting neighborhoods and subjecting thousands of residents to the risks of uncontrolled fireworks. That provision should be extinguished.

McKeown's thesis produced a strong reaction from those who thought his aim was political—to rebalance modern health-care from cure to prevention—and that he had missed statistical quirks, like the stagnation of the trend toward less disease at a time when urban populations were booming. For example, the period 1830-1870 in Britain saw few improvements in mortality, despite rising living standards. Living in cities certainly encouraged waterborne diseases like typhoid and cholera that had rarely been a problem in even the poorest villages. Public sanitation eventually did much to change this.

But Kings co-owner George Maloof disputed that last week, saying his family never agreed to pick up pre-development costs. He said it would be unfair for the team to have to cover those costs because it will be a tenant  not owner and developer  of the arena. The team owners also balked at a deal point that would force them to pay AEG its $3.2 million share if the deal falls through, unless it's AEG's fault.
As it stands, Jones' manner of death is listed as "undetermined."
Dali used a lot of Freudian analysis to rethink the Angelus as a meditation on woman as sexual predator. Dali noted that the female's clasped hands in the painting resemble the stance of the female praying mantis — a favorite surrealist symbol — just before striking and killing the male, for example. He also felt that the couple was there for more than piety; Dali saw them praying over the body of a dead child buried there. He knew he was adding layers of meaning that would never have been part of Millet's thinking; that was part of what Dali called his paranoiac-critical method, a "rereading of objects or images whose meaning is conventionally accepted, in order to probe for a new, invariably surrealist and always Dalinian meaning concealed within it," wrote Dali expert Dawn Ades.

In the age of Facebook, Twitter, viral YouTube videos, blogs and 24-hours-a-day cable-television news, information - and misinformation - spreads faster than ever. As the recent battle over health-care reform demonstrated, it's difficult to dispute a concept (such as, say, "death panels") once it takes root in the public's consciousness. Likewise, supporters of comprehensive immigration reform have had trouble countering the pervasive charge that they are promoting "amnesty" for undocumented workers already in the country.

Those comments seem tragic and misguided. But Im will to bet that theyre 100% honest. And Im willing to bet that most football players feel the same way Raiola does. We live in a society where most people believe its not going to happen to me. Its why people who have had too much to drink still get behind a wheel. Its why some motorcycle riders still dont wear helmets. Its why some NHL players still dont wear visors. Its why some people dont shred their credit card statements and their personal documents before throwing them away. Were invincible until it actually happens to us.

Those qualities have sustained Michael "Mike D" Diamond, Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz and Adam "MCA" Yauch -- ladies and gentlemen, the Beastie Boys! -- over a trailblazing career in hip-hop that stretches back to the early 1980s, when the notion of young white men rapping challenged the status quo.

And whereas the mid-section features a battle in a contained space - S.H.I.E.L.D.'s invisible flying battleship - the final 40 minutes is a massive rumble across Manhattan as Loki's alien army and their giant flying bug-things burn the city until the Avengers assemble to thwart them.

A recent report released by Families USA looks at what the Medicaid cuts envisioned in the Republican budget would mean for states in terms of lost jobs and business activity. The results are sobering. If Maryland lost just 5 percent of federal Medicaid funds — $244 million in 2011 — it would cost the state $511 million in business activity and more than 4,000 jobs. A 33 percent cut would mean a loss of $1.6 billion in federal funds, $3.4 billion in state business activity, and roughly 27,000 jobs. The first would be a blow to our state's economy, the latter would be devastating.

Still, defense attorney Ed Chernoff struck an urgent tone, telling the judge: "We are doing it because the house is on fire. We need a hose."
Ryan chopped a routine grounder to shortstop -- well, routine, that is, until Freese played a better door than a window. Freese chopped his steps in front of Angels' shortstop Erick Aybar. He was in Aybar's line of sight as the ball cleared the grass, and then it promptly went through Aybar's wickets to left field. Aybar got tagged with the error. Freese, for his trouble, raced home as the Cardinals' third run of the inning.

... You said in your last letter to the folks that you hoped I had not shot anyone. Well, in this line, I have had only one experience. One evening during Guard duty over the ruins at the end of Third Street, I saw a man about a quarter of a block away from me bending over something on the ground. I yelled at him to get out but he paid no attention to me, so I up and fired at him. I missed, of course, but the shot must have scared him for he started to run. I was just getting ready to shoot again, when a shot was fired from across the street and the fellow toppled over. This was fired by a regular who had seen him run after my shot was fired.

"I have one turntable because I thought that would be the more Polish way to go. Often, I might stop the song to harass the crowd. I don't ever write anything out. I just kind of goof around with the audience, drink beers. I basically tell people I get to act like my dad and get paid for it."
The bequest by Fields may also be the largest single gift to an Oregon institution. It eclipses two of the largest single gifts of recent memory: a $100 million donation to the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute made by Phil and Penny Knight in 2008 and another $100 million gift made by the Knights to create the University of Oregon Athletics Legacy Fund in 2007.

This week's winner, who is guaranteed a slot in the finale, is chosen not by the judges, but by the diners, and Milliken takes it easily, and it's not hard to see why.

Tales of his brother's shenanigans drew a small laugh as he recalled how his brother even walked into his room naked one day just to get a response from his big brother.
You'll likely get dinged by your own bank, too. The average fee banks charge customers for using another bank's ATM is $1.32. That fee, however, dropped from $1.46 in 2008, as some banks reduced or waived it.

"I'm sure it is (different)," Sveum said. "It's one of the (biggest) markets, one of the (biggest cities). The history and everything that goes along with Chicago and the Cubs. … Of course it's different than managing some small markets and that kind of thing. That's the way it is in Boston and New York and the big markets."

The 46-year-old Bodish, who was an event and volunteer coordinator at a museum for six years, originally turned to the Internet and a personal blog to write about his neat find from early March. Bodish had been supplementing his income with buying and reselling restored furniture, and he suddenly realized he may have hit jackpot.
Three massive presses squeezed fiber mats coated with olive paste. Greenish-gold cascades of extra-virgin oil dripped in slow motion down their length. Across the room, a trio of equally outsized grinding stones revolved in a steel dish, like giant pestles in a mortar, mashing the freshly picked olives into paste.
Swiftly walking over to the man and his son I began pleading for them not to walk on the rocks again. I was trying to tell him why it was so important to me that he not do this and began crying. He didn't want to listen, stepping towards the rocks; I kept stepping in front of him as he towered over me. Then he said, "My son just wants a rock." I pointed behind him to another part of the rocky path where we were already standing and said, "There are lots of rocks right here. Why can't he get a rock from here?"

Thomas and his mother eventually sued and reached a confidential settlement.
Vespucci said students have traditionally fared worse when new tests or required passing scores -- called cut scores -- have been instituted over the past 30 years. He insisted teachers and students have quickly adapted in the past, and scores have bounced back.

He highlighted Chongqing's economic performance and his attempts to use the power of the state to build a more egalitarian society—an approach opposed by liberals who favor Wang Yang's efforts to foster reforms in Guangdong.

Hanson cautioned against those who suggest draining the general fund to reduce tolls or for other uses. He said the fund currently serves as collateral for $232 million in bonds, $132 million in post-employee benefit obligations, $20 million in loan guarantees made for such non-DRPA projects as the Adventure Aquarium and the Victor Lofts complex — both in Camden — and insurance deductibles on its property.

"He worked hard to have this opportunity," Gay said. "I wasn't this fast in high school. I never had this kind of opportunity."
"We made a couple sloppy plays and they probably made a couple sloppy plays, but Vianney battled real hard and SLUH battled real hard and we came out on the short end of it," SLUH coach Steve Nicollerat said. "When I walk away from this game tonight, disappointed in the result? Sure. Proud of my kids? Holy cow. I'm proud of those guys. Those guys are a great bunch of guys and they are going to win a lot of games this year."
Getting the beans right is the hardest part, in my opinion. On the Central Coast we use these small, pink beans called piquintos. If you can't find them, use pinto beans. Jerry fudges the whole thing by mixing equal parts of canned pork and beans and something simply called Ranch Beans. Although this isn't why he and my sister split, I believe it to be a contributing factor. The best beans I ever had were at the BBQ/wedding reception of my college roommate, Brennecke. I asked the caterer for the recipe and he looked at me like I'd asked to deflower his daughter. Anyway, Annie, Lompoc High '75, got the following recipe years ago from the Dutra family, which has farmed and ranched around Lompoc for decades.

The money and the immense power it has conferred on tribes that had endured grinding poverty for decades have enticed many tribal governments to consolidate control over their gambling enterprises by trimming membership rolls, critics and independent analysts say.
2. The waiting is the hardest part: Orlando's season came to an end last night with a lopsided loss at Indiana. The Pacers, the No. 3 seed in the East, look like team going places, but given that Orlando played without its best player, we'll wait to see what they do against the Heat/Knicks winner to assess how real they are. They sure seem to be, though.
The location is a bit out of the way. The name is more awkward than intriguing. The interior is cramped, seating only 49. The menu covers ground already explored by other Italian places.
Tustin Lt. John Strain said residents can report stray carts to the city's code enforcement at 714-573-3149. "It is important that the citizens give the name of the store the cart came from and the location of the cart," Strain said.
Of course, you could argue that the system deserves obliteration, because it gives disproportionate power to two overwhelmingly white states whose populations amount to fewer than 5 million people. But since 1952, New Hampshire has been a crucial proving ground, where Edmund Muskie's campaign stalled after his enraged and perhaps tearful outburst at a "gutless" newspaper publisher (1972, in front of the Manchester Union-Leader building); where Jimmy Carter's surprise win put him on the path to the White House (1976); where Ronald Reagan ignored the agreed-upon rules of a debate but won the public-relations battle with the one-liner, "I paid for this microphone" (1980, in the Nashua High School gym); where Bill Clinton pronounced himself "the comeback kid" after withstanding revelations about his relationship with Gennifer Flowers (1992).
"It’s just stunning that some of these perks were actually built into labor contracts negotiated by the prior administration," Drewniak said. "Well, those contracts — all 10 of them — are up in 2011, and it’s safe to say that they will not include built-in abuses like these.

"It's good that we get our players out running and we can work on some things and its also great to reward some of the players who have put in a lot of work throughout the season and get them some playing time, especially some youngsters and some guys that are returning for next year and give us an idea."
