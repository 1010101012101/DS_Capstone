Don’t underestimate the National Honors Society tag on the top of Zeitler’s résumé. He’s as bright as he is tough, which went a long way to pushing him right up behind DeCastro. And then there’s this: Per The Sports Exchange, Zeitler led college football with 142 knock-down blocks and had 33 blocks that resulted in touchdowns. Now, his athletic ability is a bit of a deterrent — he’s a step slower than a few guys ahead of him and may have a tough time with your top-tier pass-rushers — but as far as a steady guard option that will likely be available late in the first round and into the early second, it doesn’t get much better.
Certainly, no one who watches "Bully" can pretend the systematic taunts, assaults and cyber-attacks do not have terrible consequences. Two families describe how their sons were driven to suicide. A girl is heckled and harassed until she brings a gun on her school bus.
It is the kind of loss the Rockets can hardly afford. Even in a shortened 66-game season, 21 games deep is a little early to start focusing on playoff positioning, but the Rockets expect to be in the hunt for one of the final postseason spots in the Western Conference.

But let's look at the facts. When these same Republicans – including Mr. Boehner – were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down. These same Republicans turned a record surplus that Bill Clinton left into a record deficit. Just this year, these same Republicans voted against a bipartisan fiscal commission that they themselves proposed. And when you ask them what programs they'd actually cut, they usually don't have an answer. That's not fiscal responsibility. That's not a serious plan to govern.

“The county has, in good faith, been in negotiations with the Improvement Authority for a couple of months,” said Bobbitt. “Clearly the proceeds from the nursing home should not only be used to cover the long-term obligations of the home, such as pensions, retiree health benefits, etc., but a portion should be returned to the county for direct tax relief as well.”

Spring Creek Productions ("Analyze This," "Blood Diamond") bought the film rights in perpetuity for $500,000, plus an additional $1 million if it goes into production.

Of course, once the sale of the film rights went public, the novel was quickly picked up and published by Avon Books.

Thank you, Cleveland. "Staycation" is the new buzz word for vacationing at home, which folks are doing because of the price of fuel. I think there also should be "Saycation," where you say you're going somewhere awesome even though you aren't; "Paycation," where you do take that awesome vacation and empty your wallet in the process and my favorite, "Daycation," where you have to work so much to afford the trip that you can only go for a day.
Doing battle isn't a new experience for Applewhite; in World War II, she worked as a welder in the Sun Ship yards in Chester, a beehive of activity during the wartime buildup.

Horseback riders are permitted on the trail, but the tight turns and occasionally steep stretches make it a pretty tough trip for all but expert riders.
However, the sad lesson worth noting and learning from is the failure to help these children due to the silence of all those who had heard allegations of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's alleged sexual abuse. There simply is no excuse that no one did anything — not a thing to confront Mr. Sandusky or get law enforcement involved. Were they all so afraid of being wrong to accuse, or even worse afraid of the fallout if child abuse was discovered at Penn State, so they chose silence over action?
"All the students sort of bonded with our residents, but Demetrius went above and beyond," said Abington property manager Susan Persing. "If they didn't come down to the community room, he wanted to go up and see them. He cared about others in ways I've never seen demonstrated by young people in this day and age."

The legal question of what constitutes a lottery has never been settled in Minnesota. In a letter to the governor on Nov. 3, state Solicitor General Alan Gilbert cited a 2005 Minnesota House research report that says legal authorities in other states have held that "lottery, in this context, includes most casino games. This constitutional provision has been ignored for decades in the case of charitable gambling."

No artist of the past three decades has achieved more with less than Madonna. A singer and songwriter of deliberately limited range, she has made herself an undisputed champion of popular music through the force of her personality and her fierce commitment to doing one thing well, over and over, diminishing commercial returns be damned. There is much about this to be admired, and with the release of “MDNA,” her umpteenth studio album, she has scored another circumscribed success. Once again, those who don’t appreciate her music will find nothing to enjoy, or even tolerate, on this streamlined, frothy, proudly one-dimensional set of dance-floor burners. And once again, Madonna will not care. With nothing left to prove, she will keep right on dancing.

Investors in health insurers squirmed through the first year-and-a-half of Barack Obama's presidency as his industry overhaul took shape.

Certified markets can also have vendors who sell prepared foods and even, in a separate section, items they didn't grow, such as bananas and Chinese mushrooms. So look for markets that focus on locally grown produce. Those other stands can be more profitable for market operators, but once they predominate, farmers become an afterthought, and quality suffers.
That means the yellow flashers turned off around 2:45 p.m. -- or roughly 78 minutes before Hopkins got his ticket. Hopkins said he did not remember the advisory lights being on. He travels Buckeye regularly.

According to Joyce, Zbikowski got a $100,000 purse for his first heavyweight fight in 2006, which was more than ‘‘Sugar'' Ray Leonard or Oscar de la Hoya received for their debuts.

However, that didn't diminish my belief in GTA's overall quality as a vibrant, visually arresting series that improved with each installment. I enjoyed watching each edition more than playing them and dragged myself from scene to scene mainly to see what there was to see, not so much for what there was to do.
Maybe if Fickell had done that, it would led to more dirt coming out, though. The biggest perpetrator in the memorabilia sale scandal, Terrelle Pryor, now a suspended member of the Oakland Raiders, threatened to set the whole program on fire if he were not allowed into the NFL in the supplemental draft. But a vigorous response to the latest bad news by Fickell would have given fans and many players a moral principle around which to rally.

Positive reinforcement is another draw. It's fairly easy to pick up the basics; with just a couple of practice sessions, even the rawest beginner usually can hit at least the outer circles of the target on the shortest part of the range, which is 10 yards, Caminati said. But if you want to become a top-ranked competitive shooter, you can spend years mastering the technique.

In adulthood, we seldom have tea parties. Or if we do, it's just as a token bridal shower theme or an afterthought for the monthly book club gathering. But given the long history and surprising fun of a tea party, and the recent "Downton Abbey"-inspired Anglophilia, it's a tradition worth revisiting.

"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel": A group of English retirees is sold a bill of goods about an Indian hotel for seniors. They arrive in India to (gasp!) crowded streets and less-than-stellar accommodations. The premise is predictable. But the cast brims with great actors, including Bill Nighy ("Notes on a Scandal"), Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith. Judging by the trailer, though, it's Judi Dench's movie. She glows as a woman coming in to her own in this exotic locale. (Another cliché, but who cares?) May 11

I've explored Hawaii — both as a paying customer and a member of the press — with several of the operators, including Gold-certified Atlantis Adventures, which offers submarine excursions off Oahu, Maui and the island of Hawaii, and Trilogy Excursions, which operates snorkeling trips off Maui and Lanai, plus the Silver-certified Kayak Kauai, which also leads guided hikes from its base in Hanalei. I was already impressed with their general approach to sustainability, environment and the host culture (as it's called in the biz), but it's even better to know others have scrutinized the details and found them worthy—or at least worthy-ish. Kualoa Ranch does host ATV rides in its lush valley on the Windward Side of Oahu, and Wild Side Specialty Tours, another Silver-certified company, promotes swimming with wild dolphins on Oahu's Leeward Side, neither of which rates exceptionally green in my book.

Yet not only is Brandon’s compulsion joyless it is – in Michael Fassbender’s intensely angry performance – actually painful. As the title itself suggests, his behavior isn’t really about sex, but suffering (the expression on his face at times is more agonized than orgasmic).
"What I'm thinking, I'll go contact the person in the bathroom, he's probably somebody I know hopefully by first name. Most folks up there know me by last name. We have a good rapport.'' Walters went to the restroom door, and didn't hear anything inside. "I thought the best course would be just to knock,'' Walters said. "I hoped if I knocked he would open it up.

Tough-on-crime types argue that three-strikes laws work because they get habitual criminals such as Abaire and Williams off the streets; even if they end up doing far more time than the seriousness of their crimes would justify, such offenders have had ample chances to go straight and have demonstrated they can't be trusted to live among the rest of us. It sounds reasonable, but it's bunk. These laws take discretion out of the hands of judges who would otherwise impose more sensible terms, crowd our prisons and may do nothing to deter crime (statistics on that are tough to analyze because crime actually rose after California passed three strikes, then dropped -- no one has demonstrated a conclusive connection). Some believe these laws endanger police because third-strikers sometimes take desperate measures to escape arrest. And a simple sense of fairness and decency would lead most people to conclude that putting someone in prison for stealing $1 worth of soda is not a reasonable approach to criminal justice.

"I was shocked at the level of disrespect that this treasurer showed the committee," said Buono (D-Middlesex). "The elephant in the room is the school funding formula.

But most people would consider Culver City a tad south and east of the Westside.

One doesn't have to be Tom Clancy to develop a plot of political intrigue that could actually have taken place in Cartagena. In 2007, an investigation by Telemundo and NBC News found that, "the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia has taken root in South America, fostering a well-financed force of Islamist radicals boiling with hatred for the United States and ready to die to prove it." Suppose one of them masqueraded as a prostitute and lured a Secret Service agent, or a high-ranking member of the U.S. military, into bed. She then threatens the American with exposure unless he reveals the movements of the president of the United States when he arrived at the Summit of the Americas. He does, and the president is assassinated. Several reports have indicated that the Secret Service agents had hard copies of the president's itinerary in their hotel rooms.

The two unnamed young men, played here by Triangle newcomers James Sharinghousen and Benjamin Sheppard have got the place to themselves, and they're eager to show us their masterpiece. So they act it out, each playing myriad roles. Their subject is the history of Western civilization, (think Mel Brooks' "History of the World" or "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)"), and they don't waste any time in unfurling their sprawling material, each playing (and singing) their many roles with quick changes. These changes are made in view of the audience, of course, and the fellows never try to hide their appearances, hairy chests, underwear and all. A song from a lion who eats Christians is one of the weaker numbers, but as Adam and Eve (hairy-chested Sharinghousen) sing the praises of free food and frontal nudity, we sense a hit.

I doubt Allen would have stopped drafting bad actors if the seats had remained full. I doubt he cared much that fans were embarrassed. But what the Blazers owner fears is being the only guy sitting in the arena.
Backing up their strong rotation is an offensive lineup more than able to generate runs. With power provided by the bats of Neil Lee, Micah Evans and Anthony Green, the American National Eagles scored an average of nearly nine runs per game, winning the championship game against the St. Louis Bulls 13-4.

The Terminal B security area has a nice, high ceiling to reduce the sense of claustrophobia. But the line for economy class passengers snakes back and forth, with about a 15- to 20-minute wait even during midday. Meanwhile, business class types stroll right in with no wait. It's the same arrangement in most airports in the U.S. Security is paid for by the airlines, and they make sure their high paying customers are not bothered by the security checks that the rest of us must wait to endure. But in San Jose, the ratio of the lines seemed about 100-to-1. The business line was an express train, while economy class was a shuffling conga line.

His grandfather Constantino opened DeLucia’s in 1917 as a bakery. They started making pizza here in the 1930s. Allie, Christian and Buddy make the dough every day; none of that premade stuff for them.
Libras are diplomatic, sensuous, romantic, and charming. You like balance, as evidenced by your symbol of the Scales. Venus rules you and others like you including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Will Smith, Kate Winslet, Truman Capote and Friedrich Nietzsche.

Should Texas A&M coach Pat Henry be forced to find money in his budget to transport his team to Eugene, house them, feed them, spend three days in the rain, all the while praying Jessica Beard doesn't pull a muscle, so some unheralded distance runner can earn a trip to Des Moines with a PR and a 12th-place finish in the 5,000?

The song - the trio section of the first march in a series written by Elgar - was not written with the intention of being a graduation processional. Elgar built his reputation as a composer of works for great choral festivals throughout England. In 1901, Elgar began composing five marches that would be named "Pomp and Circumstance Marches." He is perhaps best known for the first of the marches, which went on to be simply named "Pomp and Circumstance," or "The Graduation March."

Filings have run especially high in recent months as banks have brought to an end delays and moratoriums that were slowing the foreclosure process earlier this year. Housing advocates say they have also seen a surge in foreclosures on people who have lost jobs - as opposed to subprime borrowers with unaffordable mortgages. The loss of income, they say, makes it harder to rework loans to more affordable rates.

On a recent morning, Susan B. Eisenhauer was walking up the unprotected curb on the southwest side of the street. “I’m relatively new to the neighborhood and I don’t know the history . . . but I was walking along here this morning in heavy fog. There were a lot of middle school kids walking four or five abreast and it struck me that it only takes one of them to step outside the line, or one inattentive driver on a cellphone . . .”

That EIS should include the potential for mercury contamination on the West Coast from coal burning in Asia, the governor said, noting that more than 80 percent of the Columbia River Basin's mercury contamination is blown in from global sources.
Climate change: Fans, foes in the same boat
The move to receiver has come with adjustments; Mathis had to go back to the basics for a refresher course in how to line up properly, and is still catching up on the playbook.
"We would have thought prices would stabilize or come down, but that's not what we found," Bongiovanni says. "The industry grossed more money, but it did it by selling fewer and more expensive tickets," he says.

Perhaps DEET's biggest issue is safety — or the perception that it's not safe. Despite the EPA's assurances that the repellent is safe when used properly, much of the public is not convinced and is looking for safe, natural alternatives that are also effective. Those aren't aways easy to find.
The finals were preceded by two weekends of preliminary bouts, also held in Brook Park.
Zambrano finished up strong and had a great second half, and has put to bed any idea that he will waive his no-trade clause. But he'll always be a controversial player, and he will never be beloved in the Cubs clubhouse because of the tirades, and the way he disrespects teammates, like glaring at Bobby Scales after a couple misplays in his final start. If he pitches like he did the last two months, no one will care whether he disrespects his teammates -- except his teammates, and writers like me who consider it bush league.

My ambitious clothing audit began with an impulse to purge. It was getting harder to pull garments in and out of a packed closet, in which tops pressed up against dress shirts, which nudged jackets into a dark corner.
He goes to work for Westinghouse, where he invents the motor, the generator, the transformer, the turbine. He is a trusting man and does not care about money, and sure enough Mr. Westinghouse cheats him out of his rightful share. He moves from his rooms at the Waldorf Hotel, to the St. Regis, to an attic room in the New Yorker Hotel, where he cares for his beloved pigeons and measures time in 33-minute intervals. He lives with an obsessive fear of microbes. But still, he discovers : the particle beam, or "death ray." He lives on warm milk and crackers.
The burden was on the Wildcats, who emerged as the best team in the nation, to finish the job against the Jayhawks. Kentucky fans hungry for their first title since 1998 made their presence felt in the Superdome crowd of 70,913.
(05-10) 20:33 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and other gas utilities in California must replace or use high-pressure water to prove the safety of hundreds of untested gas transmission lines across the state in the wake of the San Bruno blast, a state regulatory judge has decided. The decision rejects any chance that PG&E could use records to vouch for the safety of its pipelines.
"I put in a lot of work to get back in a game, and even though it was just two innings, it was nice to get out there," Posey said shortly after leaving the game. "Everything felt about as good as it's been feeling this spring."
My thanks to The Times for having published the U.S. lawmakers’ voting records. What is hard to fathom is the record of Rep. Chris Smith, R-Robbinsville. Most people agree we need to be energy-independent. He voted to take money from the EPA so it could not monitor power plant emissions. Then he voted to allow a Canadian pipeline to Texas without a plan to deal with oil spills. Evidently, he didn’t learn anything from the Exxon Valdez, the Gulf oil mess or the Yellowstone oil mess.
“We want to look at our weakest performance,” she says.
Members of the crowd ranged from Betty Caruthers, 89, who was the school attendance clerk in 1970, to Sandi Matthews' daughter Kendra, 17, a current Mesa High School student. Both said they feel like they will lose part of their families when Mesa Junior's doors close for the last time.
Rather than wrangling and stacking the decks against one another, we have found that the best way to proceed is to move through our respective convictions in search of common ground for the sanctity of human life in various spheres -- from fetuses to the physically and spiritually impoverished. We doubt we will bring an end to abortions anytime soon, but how can we work together to limit the number of them?
“What’s interesting for me is whether he’s redeemable now at this point. … Can he be forgiven by Thor, by Odin, and can he forgive himself?” Hiddleston said. “Is he even self-aware enough to know that’s what he needs?”
The move came three days after Hinckley real estate developer David T. Terry pleaded guilty to bribing Coyne with $20,000 two years ago. Coyne, however, has not been charged with a crime.
4. The Vickers factor: There won’t be a more emotional and potentially disruptive player on the field than former Browns fullback Lawrence Vickers. He’s still getting acclimated to the Texans’ offense but has come on in the past two games. He probably will share time with James Casey. If Houston coach Gary Kubiak has any compassion for Browns fans, he will not set up a Matt Schaub-to-Vickers pass for a touchdown.
The public and private sectors can play a proactive role in drying up the flow of stolen assets that now find their way from impoverishing nations to the world's most glittering financial centers.

The Republican National Committee unveiled a commercial July 7 critical of President Barack Obama’s economic policies.
"The Artist" is no cynical pastiche, no glib and mocking reworking of old-fashioned tropes. It combines delightful humor and charm with what movies at their best have always conveyed: the honest power of pure emotion. It is a movie love story and a love note to the movies, all at the same time.
In one of the highlights of the game, he charged down the middle of the lane and tossed a breathtaking alley-oop lob to J.J. Hickson in traffic. Flynn called the play an "ice-breaker" to a night that prompted Canales to say Flynn "definitely made a case" to receive more playing time going forward.

That makes things harrowing when Nyah encounters a crabby crab and a manically flapping bird. In a preview I saw this week, the 3-D effect was full throttle there, making me dodge virtual wings and feathers. It freaked out my inner child.
Would it have been different had Patmon's pockets been deeper? Today Patmon reasons (with not so straight a face) that, had he spent $400,000 in 2005, he might have captured 40 percent of the vote and soared into the runoff. He knows he needs more dough this time around.
Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia developed YouCut in the last Congress, but it didn't get too far in the Democratic-controlled House. This year, with the GOP in charge, things are different.
"What you have to understand is that this isn't just (Garfield Heights)," Sackett said. "Every city in the county is looking for that grant. The good thing about it is that we're not all competing for it. It's my understanding that between 15-20 cities put in a request for this money, and that Homeland Security has given UAWG enough funds to cover everyone."

Nashville looked to make a game of it when it scored its second power-play goal of the game early in the third period to cut the Phoenix lead to 4-3 on a one-timer from the left circle by defenseman Ryan Suter.
Sullivan Higdon & Sink, a national advertising and marketing agency with offices in the Crossroads, joined forces with Shatto in 2004. The firm took Shatto on as a buzz client, industry-speak for strategically important startups that would benefit from mentoring while providing the creative team with new challenges. SHS' experience with dairy products and a familiarity with farm practices allowed it to sign national client Borden cheese to its client roster.

A battle the Yankees will fight without a major weapon.
Former provost of Stanford University, accomplished pianist and figure skater, she decries educational inequalities - "when you can look at your ZIP code and know whether you are going to get a good education" - and insists that setting high goals for all is essential. "I am not into the self-esteem movement. Every kid gets a trophy? No." During the question-and-answer period, listeners turned the talk to poor teachers, and then tenure, and then a guest mentioned unions as a factor. (I think card carriers - yes, I am - were in the minority around this table.)
“You see more and more at the collegiate level, rather than the prototypical guy that was a big slug tight end, double block, you see more of a tight end spread offense,” Gilbride said. “He’s almost like a hybrid receiver that’s a little bigger and that has translated into the NFL.”
Howard was a huge star, and Warner Bros. gave him his wish. Bogart was equally effective in the film version, which opens the festival Friday evening with another terrific gangster performance from Bogart in 1937's "Dead End."

But, he continues, this success came at a staggering personal cost to the submarine force.
The overseas results for "The Avengers" overshadowed a fairly quiet weekend at the domestic box office. The ensemble comedy "Think Like a Man" remained the No. 1 draw for the second-straight weekend with $17.6 million, holding off a rush of new movies that did only modest business at U.S. theaters.
Some private sector economists already were forecasting that China would pull out of its slump by late 2009. They pointed to higher bank lending and demand for steel and power as tenative signs of economic activity.
That's good, I suppose. If a meeting is not private, I guess that means it's public. And if it's public, who gives anyone -- a congressman or a president -- the right to tell you to turn off the camera on your phone?

When it was set up by President Harry Truman in 1951, the alert system was meant to be a top-down chain of communication for civil defense. Truman never used it, but local emergency managers eventually realized that EAS, and blowing the old air-raid sirens, were effective ways to warn people about dangerous storms.
Sikking says he also tries to “give a little of the play back to Claudio and Hero, who I’ve seen just get swept aside in a lot of productions.” And helping to set the tone for it all will be composer Stephen Alexander’s period musical settings of Shakespeare’s verse, and design elements that turn Dogberry’s constables into lifeguards and the governor’s palace into a burger joint.
