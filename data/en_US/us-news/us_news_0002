I'd hazard to say that most of the dudes behind the "Brokeback" mashups haven't seen the film. No matter; having parodied it, they'll want to check it out. And I have a dream, see. I dream that somewhere out in Bushland people who missed "Brokeback Mountain" in theaters, either through their own fear or their neighborhood Cineplex's refusal to show it, will feel safe ordering it from Netflix and watching it in the privacy of their shag-carpeted living rooms, sandwiched between "American Pie II" and that sanctimonious exercise in sadomasochism, "The Passion of the Christ." Maybe they'll even toss in "Evil Dead," just for chuckles.

But live TV has taken on a mystique for both performers and viewers ever since video tape was invented during TV's infancy in the 1950s.

Much of the discussion surrounding the anniversary of bin Laden's death, however, has focused not on national security but on politics. President Barack Obama has made his decision to launch the mission that killed bin Laden a part of his re-election campaign, and Republicans have roundly criticized him for exploiting that success for partisan advantage. Of course, there's more than a bit of hypocrisy in the GOP complaint, since President George W. Bush used the capture of Saddam Hussein for similar purposes when he ran for re-election.

Oregon roughed up UCLA (20-6, 7-3) starter Adam Plutko early scoring five runs in the game's first four innings.

Ryan and other politicians tend not to subtract the $1 trillion when mentioning the infrastructure deficit, a point of clarification.

Now 66, Farley moved to Portland in 1980. In addition to a regular job, he had a side gig as DJ for weddings, parties and corporate events.

But Farley, divorced and with two kids ages 3 and 5, wasn't one to turn down any job.

The man was working on a portion of a state Department of Transportation resurfacing project on nearby Interstate 287, for which Route 22 is being used as a staging area, the DOT said.

In August, President Obama and European allies publicly called on Assad to step down. But despite his government's bloody response to its own people, Western military intervention, which theoretically could speed Assad's departure, seems to be off the table.

Since he came to power in 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had little regard for the Obama administration's opinions — because the president has not been afraid to speak his mind about Israel's intransigence and a policy which might be dubbed "shoot first, ask questions later."

He took his wife, Fanny, and his infant son, John L., to Titusville, Pa., where Col. Edwin Drake had recently discovered how to drill into rich veins of oil under the Pennsylvania countryside.
In his speech, Cameron decried multiculturalism's "hands-off tolerance" of some cultural behaviors -- he used the example of forced marriages -- that are antithetical to Western values. Instead, Britain needs to win the hearts and minds of newcomers with the ideals of personal liberty and individualism, combating multiculturalism-induced rootlessness that can cause some to find a home in political extremism.
"My original way into theater was through reading," he says, recalling a boyhood illuminated by Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" and all of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s books. "When I fell in love with theater it was because that was a way of making the stories I loved come alive."

If any misdeeds are limited to Dunn, then the impact will fall on Dunn rather than on Best Buy, Spieckerman said. But if the investigation determines he frequently used company funds in the pursuit of an inappropriate relationship, then "heads will have to roll," she added.
"Extending the Bush tax cuts will get about 30 cents of stimulus for each federal dollar invested, while costing the country $700 billion over the next ten years," Kaptur said. "We will have to borrow from China and Saudi Arabia to pay for these tax cuts, while Wall Street pulls record profits and the nation continues to suffer through what feels like to many a jobless recovery."

I was glad to not have to wait long for a table, but the back seemed overly spare and isolated. I missed the comfy touches of the front room -- the picture windows, the honeyed lighting and the open kitchen, with marble counters the colors of a calico cat.
Q: Hey, Tony: Has there been any reports, good or bad, about that huge undrafted offensive lineman we picked up from Canada, Joel Reinders? He has freakish physical attributes. I'd like to see us keep him and develop him more. Could be a nice find. Joel Reinders vs. Cliff Geathers in one-on-one drills must be interesting . . . who do you think would win? -- Robert Benjamin Jr., Crestview, Fla
One of Philadelphia's great assets is a huge inventory of affordable housing, a key to our population growth. And plenty of eager investors are ready and willing to buy properties and vacant lots.

Before this game, pitching coach Dave Eiland asked Luis Mendoza what had changed since spring training. Luis pitched as well or better than anyone in Surprise, but has pitched poorly since breaking camp. Luis said he thought he had to be better to compete during a big league season. The result has been being too fine  trying to make perfect pitches on the corners. Dave Eiland told Luis to trust his stuff, pound the zone with low strikes and let hitters get themselves out.

The Kings already were leading 1-0 by the time that fight took place, having taken the air out of the Blues and the building with Richards scoring only 31 seconds into the game, converting a rebound after Penner’s solid drive to the net.
A: Cash for Clunkers, the summertime government program that gave consumers up to $4,500 to trade in a clunker for a more fuel-efficient vehicle, helped many new car dealers reduce their inventories in July and August. And most car companies have cut production because of the tough economy so many consumers had less to choose from when they surveyed dealerships in October.

LaGace said the district has made switching to a new platform an easy step for students and teachers, including providing a way for iPad users to access the district's "cloud" to open files that are created on netbooks or teacher tablets. Each iPad will be equipped with a rubberized cover that should protect it from most drops and dings. Schools will get to choose whether the equipment stays on campus or goes home with students, he said.
So I was surprised to see the 2010 Barkan Classic Pinot Noir selling for $10.99 at the Wine and Cheese Place, 457 North New Ballas Road in Creve Coeur. The timing couldn't have been better, because pinot noir is a good wine to bring to a Passover seder, which like Thanksgiving feasts, incorporates a range of foods and flavors. Pinot noir is a versatile red that goes well with popular seder entrees such as brisket, roast chicken or salmon.
Corruption is embedded in China's unique approach to economic and political governance. When China began to experiment with capitalism in the late 20th century, many government officials became entrepreneurs. The Communist Party also encouraged local officials to compete for investment. These local officials gained enormous power, which they used to demand bribes, distribute resources and provide favors.

Mammograms and colorectal screening tests are meant to screen a healthy population for conditions in which it's proved that treatments give significant benefit, i.e. longer life or better quality of life.

Because of the program's structure, many long-term owners enjoy steep discounts on their tax bills, while recent buyers pay the full cost, the recent Sun investigation documented. One result is that wealthier residents who have owned their homes for years pay just a fraction of their annual tax bill.
Three Ohio men -- Douglas Shisler of Doylestown, Peter J. Esposito of Middleburg Heights and James L. Binge of Jackson Township in Stark County -- were charged for their roles as Cyprus Funds co-directors. Shisler and Esposito each served less than three years in federal prison and are now free. Binge died while his case was pending.
Twelve years ago, the Shackletts expanded production to a greenhouse near their home in the even more remote, isolated hamlet of Onyx, a 40-minute drive west of Ridgecrest. They closed the facility three years ago, after the price of propane skyrocketed and it became too expensive to heat it.
First, here's what it won't do: take sides, award you money if you've been harmed or return funds you've spent. And it doesn't launch inquiries into complaints it doesn't have the legal authority to look into -- those against nurses, for example.
There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.
“Why do people who wear perfume insist on using so much? For all the world to smell?

Please consider your fellow man.”
Its an unfortunate situation, Bryant said. James, from what I hear, is OK. As far as Metta goes, he has to focus on himself, and however many games they give him, they give him. He just has to be prepared, and when he comes back, just step right in and be ready to go.

The original version ran about 4 1/2 hours; at 2 1/2 hours, the international version shown here seems a bit much. But it has commitment and style, and you can see why Woo, the noted Hong Kong action director, would want to produce it: It fits right in with his "heroic bloodshed" cinematic legacy.

Instead of getting what they're worth, the players receive athletic scholarships that don't cover the full cost of attending school, leaving many of them living below the poverty line, says the report, "The Price of Poverty in Big Time College Sport."
A year and a half later, we were ready to take a few more tentative steps (literally and figuratively) out of the studio. We wanted to dance. Out-on-the-town dance. We wanted to go to dinner at a nice restaurant and, with casual elegance, slip from our seats and glide to the dance floor. But where was there such a place?
The surface drudgery of a bad date isn't the only hazard of thoughtless matchmaking, though: It also holds insult potential when you get paired with your definition of a grasping lowlife or galloping head case.
One reporter at today's news conference wondered if Kucinich regretted not going after Kaptur more forcefully on her home turf.
"It's fine as long as it helps us to win nationals," Schmitt said. "To get to nationals is an absolute dream. They've worked so hard. They've been out doing two-a-days right now in the St. Louis summer."
The witty Youngs remains best known for the quiet, confessional "F*** was I," the lament of a woman who couldn’t stop herself from falling in love with a close friend. She may break out her acoustic guitar when she takes the stage Thursday at Maxwell’s with her three-piece band. Yet considering the propulsive sound of her "An Unwavering Band of Light" album, due out Feb. 7, attendees should expect her to rock.
"During the time we were closed, there were other businesses opened under the Burns name," Cory said. "In order to eliminate confusion, we decided to add 'Original' to our name to inform customers that we are, and always will be, the Original Burns BBQ that they know and love. We still use the same pits and the same recipes that my grandfather used."
About two thirds of Nashville’s middle-school math teachers volunteered to participate in the experiment. Half of the 296 teachers were placed randomly in a control group, while the rest were eligible for bonuses of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 if their pupils scored significantly higher than expected on a statewide exam.
Bales' post from March 2011, about the Army promotion, appears to have been the blog's latest entry. In it, she explained why she maintained the site in the first place. The collection of posts was a "time capsule," she wrote, and she hoped that her children would one day "enjoy reading about the decisions that Mom and Dad went through during their lives."
"It's stupid to keep these," he said. "But how many people have ashes from the 1906 earthquake?"
According to the grand jury report, Paterno testified that he referred the account relayed by the assistant to his superior. Paterno has maintained that a more detailed description of what allegedly occurred in the showers was never passed on to him.

As chief judge of the Court of Appeals, Lippman presides over New York's Office of Court Administration -- with its 18,000-plus employees, $2.7 billion budget and life-and-death grip on issues of intense interest to trial lawyers everywhere.
Danny Coughlan sets the tone here with a doo-wop-flavored waltz called "I Cherish the Heartbreak More Than the Love That I Lost," which somehow manages to live up to its title, and proceeds to mope his way like the kid in a Morrissey haircut through an album packed with devastated love songs. The '60s-flavored pop gem "We're Supposed to Be in Love" finds him pining the title with total conviction, followed by "But in the very same breath we're finding different ways of breaking apart." The overall effect feels like Morrissey singing an album of singles Phil Spector was hoping to pitch to Roy Orbison, hopelessly devoted to the sound and passion of a bygone era.
So where is the doubt about Clemons' guilt?
It was not until July 2011 that Maryland's highest court, the Court of Appeals, spoke on the question of the impact of Maryland's speech or debate clause. Unfortunately, it repeated the sins of the Court of Special Appeals in the Blondes case by not taking the opportunity to give full weight to the anti-bribery provision that had been added to the Maryland Constitution in 1867.
The parents of Fee's partners, the boards of the two theaters, were intrigued but wary.
"The prospect of drilling in Ohiopyle is going to be tremendously jarring," said John Quigley, the former secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and now a consultant for the environmental group Penn Future.

While Kasich blamed previous governors for over-promising funds for ODOT projects, it is worth noting that Wray previously served as ODOT's director from 1991 to 1999 under governors George Voinovich and Bob Taft. Also former Gov. Ted Strickland, when he took office in 2007, raised concerns over whether ODOT had enough money to cover planned projects.

Indeed, the "uninsured crisis" itself is properly regarded as a symptom, not a cause, of high costs. The insured consume two and a half times as much health care as the uninsured. This massive consumption is largely a result of being insured, and therefore immunized from the direct cost of health care. It's as if you paid a $10 co-pay for a tank of gas and your car insurer paid the balance. The roads would be even more congested than they are now! Further, one third to one half of this spending does not contribute to better health. The blunt fact is that most of us are overinsuredbut few of us are prepared to accept that fact, so most politicians ignore it.
Matthew Bennett, who represents Schurick, said political speech is often deceiving and that the prosecution of Schurick creates a "slippery slope" that could curtail free speech. He said he saw a campaign poster during that election that depicted O'Malley as being on a ticket with Obama — which he said was designed to trick voters into casting ballots for the incumbent governor. He said the poster was misleading because Obama wasn't running.
This week, the Liberty Towers apartment complex in Newton contacted an exterminator to battle an infestation. Last week, the AMC/Loews movie complex at Monmouth Mall closed after bedbugs were found.

In a report to the Metro Council, Auditor Suzanne Flynn said the regional government has plans in place to buy, stabilize and develop nature parks, but not for ongoing maintenance. Because of that, employees "filled the void with their own initiative and experience" and sometimes worked at cross purposes.
The roasted-malt character of this almost-black schwarzbier displays itself with a cocoa-powder aroma. The flavor, however, is not nearly as roasty as the color suggests. The beer's lager yeast, pilsner malt and German hops combine to create a clean-tasting beer with a crisp, dry finish. If you've been fooled by the misconception that dark equals heavy, this beer will set you straight. Available on draft at the brewery and several bars and restaurants around town. At 4.4 percent ABV, you could drink several Black Lagers on St. Patrick's Day.

Thoms said he was puzzled by comments made by PBA President Ives pertaining to different police cultures in the two communities.
That would be a mistake -- at least this early in the careers of both rookies. Jamison's presence is benefiting the club, and specifically the two first-rounders. Despite a few dubious shooting nights -- notably 6-of-20 in the opener against Toronto -- he is the only other starter besides Irving creating his own shot. That can't be overstated. Take away Jamison, and Irving loses one of his best options as well as a player who can stretch the defense and create lanes for the penetrating point guard.
Children are repeatedly encased in pressurized oxygen chambers normally used after scuba diving accidents. This unproven therapy is meant to reduce inflammation that experts say is little understood and may even be beneficial.

physical characteristics. Still, we don't see the phrase "Irish-looking man" in the newspaper, though red hair and pale skin are common Irish characteristics. Would a picture come to mind if a TV anchor said, "The suspect appeared to be Italian"?

The number of kids in state custody increased from 10,515 in September 2010 to 11,682 on Oct. 31, 2011, the last day of the Department of Economic Security's most recent, and still unreleased, report on kids in care. That's an 11 percent increase. Yet DES Director Clarence Carter says he did not ask for additional funding for children in out-of-home care.
Get over the stigma. The perception that it's only the downtrodden shopping at thrift and consignment stores has all but been quashed thanks to a stubbornly stagnant economy. And shows like A&E's "Storage Wars" and the History Channel's "American Pickers" have turned that stigma into mystique, Cutler said. Bottom line: if you're going to shop thrift, swallow your pride and grab a cart.
Sarah: During lunch with Ben’s family, Lindzi was so nervous and kept dropping everything, which made me like her more. I really hope Ben doesn’t pick her because she deserves better. Ben’s sister cornered her and grilled her about Courtney rather than getting to know Lindzi better. Julia hasn’t met Courtney yet and already doesn’t like her!
Mr. Smith, who runs a trail-riding operation and captures many horses to limit the herd size and protect the newly abandoned "dumpouts" from harm, thinks there is a solution that makes many people uncomfortable: the slaughterhouse.
Also noteworthy about this Honda's power is that it's not much for towing. Buyers looking to tow more than the CR-V's 1,500-pound limit don't have the option of choosing a larger engine, as buyers of the Ford Escape or Toyota RAV-4 do.
Wenders feels a special bond with Bausch. They became friends over the years, and, both having been born in or near Dusseldorf, Germany, they could speak a Rhineland accent and enjoy their dialect.

Whatever happens to Apple's bookstore, customers should still be able to read e-books on the company's devices. While Forrester says that slightly more than half of iPad owners say they use the device to read books, many do so on third-party iPad apps like the Kindle app.
Having Bush to attack has been convenient for both groups. The tea party movement says its roots are in a rebellion against the Bush administration's increased deficits and bailout of Wall Street firms. This has allowed its members -- people who generally voted for Bush twice and then McCain in 2008 -- to cast themselves as independent from the GOP.
Former Justice Peter Verniero, who listened to nearly two hours of arguments in the gallery, acknowledged the pressure the justices will face in ruling on a judicial matter, but said they are used to deciding high profile, controversial cases.

The South Jersey Democrat also introduced a bill mirroring Christie’s call to end payouts to retiring public employees for unused sick days. And when Sweeney vowed to "take seriously" the leak of confidential questionnaires filled out by two Supreme Court nominees, Christie gushed.
Sun Peaks isn't widely known outside British Columbia, but it should be. In B.C., it is second in size only to Whistler and has the country's third biggest skiable area, 3,678 acres of diverse terrain including alpine bowls, glade skiing, snowboard parks, groomed cross-country trails and backcountry routes. Spread across three mountains are 121 downhill runs up to five miles long. Sun Peaks also has the biggest vertical drop (2,891 feet) in interior B.C.

Campaign regulations usually focus on money, supposedly to prevent quid pro quo corruption or the appearance thereof pertaining to candidates.

Hence their obsession with political money, most of which funds the dissemination of speech.

Creme brulee. Once the cream is heated, add flavorings like coffee, lavender, or savories such as butternut squash. Cover the pot, turn off the heat and allow the cream to infuse for at least 10 to 20 minutes.

For a perfect creme brulee that is creamy and delicate, it is imperative to not over mix or over bake it. Baking should always be done in a water bath to allow even cooking and to prevent a crust from forming.

øA: The ECB changed what could be collateral for the European banks, which is important. They made what a bank can use as collateral much wider, and they put unlimited use of three-year lending. It was a huge move, much bigger than the market reaction we saw. It's possible that this one thing has removed all funding issues for the big European banks. It gives them breathing room and can help support asset prices in the meantime. The European banks are still being forced to raise capital and by that, they still have to sell assets. They're being forced to sell assets to raise even more capital at precisely the wrong time. It's not a massive amount, but you're starting to see assets for sale, loans for sale. It's tough. You can't do a good job for shareholders raising capital with huge discounts for some assets.

Gasco's version of empanadas ($7.25) is unusual; they're more like pressed sandwiches cut into triangles.

Hales: Well, I'm interested in continuing this regional effort of building partnerships. And that's something I'm good at. I've done it before. I've been very involved in building across the whole metropolitan area about things, whether it was about the urban growth boundary or building a transit system. For example, when I was involved in the transit agenda, we really helped the mayor of Hillsboro and her advocacy to get light rail to not just stop in Beaverton but all the way out to Hillsboro. Look at the effect of that with Nike and Intel and other folks on the line. So the same thing goes for the arts. Part of what I can bring is credibility in the whole region, and a belief that we are an organic region that needs to work together. And the arts is one of these areas where I'll continue to call on the rest of the region to step up and help with arts funding and support arts in all of the schools. I'm sure we'll talk about that when we get to talk about funding measures. There are school districts that are partly in Portland and partly not. The Centennial School District, for instance. Well, all of those kids ought to have access to arts in their daily life and as part of their curriculum in school. We need to think beyond the city limits and that's the important theme of that whole effort.

Hey, Tony: What are the chances the front office is second-guessing their decision on Shurmur? His offense is the second-worst in the NFL, his play-calling does not even come close to playing to the strengths of what "talent" he does have, he stubbornly sticks with rookie guards when they have made mistake after mistake, his inconsistent lineups have ticked off or alienated Hillis and Cribbs, the team's two best (only two) playmakers, and his love affair with Hardesty has left a "Braylon Edwards" amount of drops snuffing out drives. -- Chris Zanon, Canton

Ms. Newhouse is no stranger to Europe's most revered classical concert halls, like Vienna's Musikverein and Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, and the grand 19th-century European opera houses. But as an architectural historian with an equal interest in the past and the present, she has made a particular study of new construction in the U.S. Because she understands the nature and necessity of social, technological and architectural change, she goes beyond conventional architectural criticism and acoustical analysis to outspoken criticism of the results. And she has come to some surprising conclusions.

Coleman, who was awarded a $30,000 grant from Cleveland's Civic Innovation Lab to develop CityProwl, hopes to expand the concept to other cities. She also plans to approach Cleveland hotels about offering guests portable audio players stocked with the five Cleveland tours, and she is considering recording tours of the Buckeye, Glenville and Fairfax neighborhoods and the grand public buildings of the city's 1903 Group Plan.
Here's how it works: One end of the tack hammer is magnetized. The upholsterer fills his mouth with little tacks then stretches whatever fabric he's applying till it's taut. The hammer goes to the lips, where a tack is "spit" onto it. Single tacks are applied to the bottom, each side and top of a piece's frame to hold the fabric in place, with the wrinkles stretched out each time, before it's all stapled down.
Then Damon jumped up, saw third base was unprotected, and stole that, too. You looked at your teenage son wearing his Utley jersey and a forlorn expression, and whispered, “The Phillies are dead.” You just knew something mystical was happening.

Canada has offered to pay $550 million in advance to cover Michigan's share of the project and be paid back through bridge tolls. Snyder and bridge supporters say Michigan taxpayers would be insulated from any shortfall in bridge revenues by ironclad legislation.
But some experts warn that stability might be threatened if current trends continue.
The first walk begins on an all-dirt trail at an easy grade and then joins a steep and sometimes slippery trail that provides a view of several waterfalls. The second walk is on a dirt trail to the Mitchell Canyon Visitor Center through a native plant garden. Walkers may choose 5K or 10K routes for both walks.
And while some have Hightower falling to the San Francisco 49ers or Baltimore Ravens, I’m not buying that either. I think he’s gone before that. And if not, the two teams I just mentioned will snatch him up.

A musical producer is to a recording, what a director is to a movie.
Beldini, a 75-year-old Democrat, was convicted on two of the six corruption counts she faced following a two-week trial in January and, under sentencing guidelines, faced up to four years and three months in jail. The one-time burlesque dancer sat silently during most of Monday's hearing, wearing a white jacket, a black skirt and pearl earrings. Moments before Linares announced her sentence, Beldini told the judge she had never been so afraid. "I stand before you facing the most terrifying moment of my whole life," Beldini said, her voice shaking.
"It would be tragic if any woman — let alone thousands of women — lost access to these potentially lifesaving screenings because of a politically motivated attack," the senators wrote.

His rhetoric aside, Bloomberg seems hesitant to insist on that. Instead, he's called for a number of piddling reforms to let the city manage its own affairs -- overseeing its own tax collection, for example, or buying supplies, free of state rules. All fine, but not close to closing the mammoth gaps.
In fact, poll after poll reveals that the public considers jobs to be the subject their elected officials should address.

Coming off a successful winter campaign, seniors Everett Price and Devind Kullar and juniors Chris Aresco and Joe Flanagan were optimistic about the 4 x 800.

In Argentina, the Roadblock required one team member to jump out of an airplane and the other team member to drive to a marked location to meet up. The non-jumping sister turned her car off the road at the wrong spot and got stuck in some deep sand. She had to wait for friendly locals to drive past and tow her car out. If not for the friendly locals, they would have lost the race right there.
Though “Mad Men” secured the Golden Globe for best drama, Showtime’s “Dexter,” about a creepily moral serial killer, scored two acting awards, one for star Michael C.

Obama told Rolling Stone magazine that he did not believe Romney would be able to disavow the conservative positions he took during the primaries.
Spicy beef soup is fun to eat, with long strings of beef, noodles and slender sprouts wrapping around each other in a pleasant confusion. Seasoned broiled black cod is warming and excellent; the flavors of cod and fermented soy paste form a sort of dense nectar, which the chunks of daikon soak up like a sponge.
"We strongly support our son and all the troops," said Linda.
"There’s only so much excitement you can pack into one day," he said. "The effort is to capture business early on the assumption people will come back and buy more. They’ll forget they bought something or because they’ve had it for so long, it won’t be as special, so they feel they have to get one more thing."
Sorkin and the other filmmakers are clearly aware that Mezrich's book has become something of a liability for the film and are now distancing themselves from the work. "I know this is how Facebook is pushing back against the movie," said Sorkin. "Nothing in the movie has been invented for the sake of Hollywood-izing it or sensationalizing."

This seems to be the year for passion projects for the director. His energetic documentary "Pearl Jam Twenty" indulged his love of rock music, and now "Zoo" celebrates his love of family. Though neither movie reaches the level of Crowe's standout films — the autobiographical intimacy he achieved in 2000's "Almost Famous," which earned him a screenwriting Oscar, or the what-makes-Sammy-run electricity of 1996's "Jerry Maguire" — "Zoo" is definitely one from the heart.
Credentials in hand, I soon thereafter checked in for The Heart Truth Red Dress fashion show. I go to the show for kicks, not the fashions. The purpose is to bring awareness to the perils of heart disease, but the perks include sitting across the aisle from Susan Sarandon (she looked a little like she woke up recently and dressed ultra casual in a well-worn preppy pink Polo) and Johnny Weir (who wore very sparkly pants and gloves).
"It was really exciting watching it ," said Daisy Lee, 14, of Paterson, who came with her family to celebrate Father's Day with her dad Leo, a big fan of the sport who dreamed of being a pilot himself.

For many years, the couple has had a cocktail hour ritual. While White cooks, Smith surprises her with a drink — a margarita, a martini, whatever. He used to give her the cocktail to sip while preparing dinner and then retreat to the computer. But White recently asked him to stay with her in the kitchen.

So the next time we see the pair, they’re 23, and the injuries are more serious. By now, Doug believes Kayleen has special healing powers to heal the eye he has blown out with a firework. Kayleen, preparing for her unsupportive father’s funeral in the morning by drinking herself blurry and driving her car off the road, calls him a “freak” and a “crackhead” instead.
Houston’s family rejected a public spectacle for a final farewell to the pop icon, choosing instead to hold a private, invitation-only funeral at New Hope, the singer’s childhood church, which seats about 1,500. The Rev. Joe A. Carter, pastor at New Hope Baptist Church, said he will officiate the service, which is scheduled to begin at noon. Houston was born in Newark and raised in East Orange.
The claim: Suzanne Kosmas is no moderate. She's a Nancy Pelosi "liberal Democrat." This is one of Adams' favorite claims. But it's a stretch. The widely respected National Journal described Kosmas one of the 10 most moderate members of the entire U.S. House. Kosmas sided with Republicans on everything from estate taxes to opposing high-profile pork in Democratic districts. OpenCongress.org said she voted with John Boehner 58 percent of the time. Kosmas is certainly more liberal than most Republicans. But anyone trying to portray her as a flaming lefty is being disingenuous.
Still, possessing a live Snakehead is against the law, punishable by a fine of up to $500, depending on previous offenses.
øAs Rick shared, "My partner had moved on with his life. But there I was left stewing, hurt and bitter. I allowed him to determine my mood and my happiness. I let him play a role in whether I'd attend a meeting I thought he might be at. I'd wake up hating him while he was probably waking up thinking, 'Should I have Corn Flakes or Cheerios?' "
Chesnut said that the disease is wide-reaching enough to welcome any effort to raise awareness, even if it shuns pink for stark images in black and white.
The handwritten note, received by District Judge Daniel Mabley just before the verdicts were presented last week, said: "Can this be read in the courtroom in front of Ms. Senser? We believe, she believed she hit a car or vehicle and not a person."
On the surface, the minimum benefits requirement does seem to mandate comprehensive coverage. But another provision of the law works in the opposite direction, and the two have to be weighed together.
When the Zafars began building the house, they had some ideas of what they wanted. "An open floor plan was important to us," says Sajid, "and a first-floor master bedroom."

The replay showed the ball was out.
To be sure, not every store was filled to the brim with people looking for deals on Black Friday. With so many major stores opening at midnight, crowds shopped early, staying up late to snag the best deals. That meant there was an unusual lull during the typically bustling pre-dawn hours when stores used to open their doors.
For a while after Sullivan leaves, the relationship continues via frequent letters. Camille follows his progress with pins on a wall map of South America, a situation that is not fated to last, though that doesn't make its ending any less of a jolt.
On spending, the measure generally consists of relatively small adjustments to thousands of individual programs. Agencies like the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement would get a boost within the Homeland Security Department, while GOP defense hawks won additional funding to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal. The troubled, over-budget, next-generation F-35 fighter plane program would be largely protected.

Kazmi, 52, of Rochester Hills, sat quietly until his case was called Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court in downtown Detroit. He said little and offered no plea when federal Magistrate R. Steven Whalen agreed to a prosecution request to limit his travel to southeastern Michigan. Whalen set a $10,000 bond for Kazmi and ordered him to continue the treatment he has been receiving for mental health issues.
We realize there are further debates to be had about the exact terms and language of the amendment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for instance, does favor such an amendment but wants a 35-year residency requirement for naturalized citizens; Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) would require individuals to have been a citizen for a quarter of a century. But it's remarkable that 18 out of 55 members failed to get back to us on this issue altogether, three refused to comment and 11 others couldn't muster a simple "yes" or "no" answer to these fundamental questions. These include both Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Feinstein reminded us that she had serious concerns about such an amendment the last time the issue was looked at by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but that she would keep an open mind on future proposals. Boxer simply said she'd want to look at the specific language of any proposed amendment before taking a position, but she wouldn't even answer the first question regarding Schwarzenegger's predicament.
"It has got to be central, that's a function of downtown," he said. "You wouldn't want to eliminate that function at the core of the region."
In its motion, the ACLU noted concerns about how the state would collect, store and protect the personal information that people would be required to present under the new standards. They also cited the likely "substantial costs" of implementing the new standards, and said many people — such as domestic violence victims, homeless people and Americans who were born in other countries — would likely face new, major hurdles in getting or renewing licenses.
The counties west of Asheville and south of Great Smoky Mountains National Park are famous for their aquatic cascades -- some powerful, some puny, all a result of the region's dramatic elevation variations and high rainfall.
Kroeger: This is so over the top. We’ve got this flying stage that comes down and picks us up and takes us across the arena and starts spinning ... it’s just absolute insanity. We’ve got this massive screen that splits apart in six different sections, and we’ve got these ... conveyor belts that transport us from parts of the stage.
"Right now, the residents have no trust," Pippin said. "Morale is low in the county. I have no faith in them whatsoever."
By late October and early November, when the 2009-2010 novel H1N1 vaccine became widely available, the virus was spreading quickly throughout Europe and North America. As a result, many patients were likely exposed to the virus after getting the vaccine but before their bodies were able to mount an immune response -- a process that takes at least two weeks. That timing hitch may have driven down the vaccine's apparent effectiveness, said Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist with George Washington University and an expert on influenza, in an interview Tuesday.
Paterno certainly had detractors, as well. One former Penn State professor called his high-minded words on academics a farce. He was criticized for making broad critiques about the wrongs in college football without providing specifics. A former administrator said his players often got special treatment compared to non-athletes. His coaching style often was considered too conservative. Some thought he held on to his job too long. There was a push to move him out in 2004 but it failed.

Hot flashes are perhaps the best-known symptom of menopause. The occurrence of hot flashes varies in frequency and intensity from person to person and over time. They can be severe and frequent enough to interfere with daily activities and even with sleep. When this is the case, women may seek relief in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In general, the current practice is to use the lowest effective dose of HRT to relieve symptoms and to use it for the least amount of time necessary.

(05-10) 13:01 PDT New York (AP) --
Shumpert hurt his knee in the third quarter of Game 1 in the Knicks' first-round Eastern Conference Playoff series with the Heat. The combo guard was particularly useful to interim coach Mike Woodson for his defensive presence against Miami's Dwyane Wade, not to mention his ability to handle the basketball in the absence of Jeremy Lin, who is out because of a torn meniscus in his left knee.
Marini's, which sells 19 flavors of saltwater taffy as well as caramel apples and homemade fudge, is now run by Joseph Marini III, 34, whose great-grandfather Victor started out with a popcorn cart on the boardwalk in 1915. As a kid, Marini used to sweep the floor of the candy store.
"I applaud Edgar for his ability to develop the cultural capital for … the project. If it comes to communication with funders and the art world about the project, I'd give him an A+," said Lowe, founder of Project Row Houses in Houston. "But when it comes to internal stuff, how he's been able to use the project as a way to access the potential of the existing community, that's a different story."

Snapvine: The company lets people post personalized voice comments to their MySpace pages. It has raised more than $2 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson and other investors.
His opinion is entitled to change, but if Booker is labeling Vanderbeek “one of the most despicable owners” in the NHL, we’ll just assume he’s too busy tweeting to keep up with the league. One team (Atlanta) moved last season (to Winnipeg), another (Nashville) is constantly threatening to do the same and yet another (Phoenix) doesn’t even have an owner. The NHL is running the team.

In the latest quarter, Lipitor revenue fell 42 percent to $1.4 billion, mainly due to a 71 percent plunge in the U.S. However, CEO Frank D'Amelio said in an interview that U.S. market share was "was 2 1/2 times higher than what we would have expected" without the deals.

Yes. Tom Welter, executive director of the Oregon School Activities Association, said that as long as the schools control the programs, they can still participate in existing leagues and playoffs. Money raised by parents or boosters could simply be channeled through the district to operate them, regardless of the source, he said.
Funny, he said, how many of them were 1 irons. There was the shot at Pebble Beach that helped him hold off Bruce Crampton. There was also another 1 iron at Augusta National, with Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller pressuring him, that led to his Masters victory in 1975.

So why haven't you seen "Brokeback Mountain" yet? The "Brokeback Mountain" phenomenon has become as unavoidable as a military recruiter at a continuation school. You can't turn on the television without seeing a gay cowboy, every theater seems to be playing the picture and each day seems to bring a new shopping cart full of awards for the movie -- including eight Oscar nominations this week. It's hard to find a straight man who has seen the movie and regrets it.
Authorities, on the other hand, say Lowson and his co defendants used 100,000 internet protocol addresses, hundreds of e-mails and other modern tricks to commit old-fashioned fraud and hide the fact that the tickets were bought by a single company instead of individual fans.
Dear Margo: I am a couponer who has been lucky to stockpile expensive products. My question concerns my coupons and etiquette. Is it acceptable to use items from my stockpile as gifts? For example, a friend of the family is having a baby. They are struggling financially, and the husband was laid off soon after the wife found out she was pregnant. In lieu of a gift I asked the woman to come over and "shop" at my house. I wanted to help cut their expenses so the money they do have can be used for other things. Since I have every thing from cleaning supplies to personal hygiene items to baby wipes, I thought it more prudent to help with everyday items, rather than buy, say, baby clothes. Do you think this is appropriate? I do not want to come off as cheap. The woman will be taking home more than $250 in products that are the best name-brand items. Because of the coupons, though, I only paid about $20 for it all. I also make gift baskets of full size and sample-sized matching items from the stockpile. What do you think of this? — Coupon Crazy in Kansas City

The court's four liberal justices all seemed friendly toward the law, while two conservative justices—Mr. Scalia and Samuel Alito—left little doubt they would vote against it. Justice Clarence Thomas remained silent, as is his custom, but his prior writings suggest little sympathy for the government's position.
U.S. District Judge Garr M. King sentenced Lafayette F. Keaton on Tuesday to six months' confinement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, followed by six months of house arrest.

In the debate so far, many of the arguments have been based on rhetoric, not fact. It is important to remember that efforts to maximize judicial "independence" from the electorate can also maximize independence from the law and the Constitution. Without a mechanism for effectively holding judges accountable, judges are free to "go rogue" and make decisions based solely on their political views. Is that better than a campaign season every now and then?
However, electric vehicles tend to reduce oil consumption in nearly all regions, the group said.

The pope's speech went to the heart of a pastoral challenge for church leaders presented with faithful Catholics in unhappy marriages: how to allow an individual Catholic another chance at marriage in the church (charity), while upholding the church's belief in the permanence of marriage (justice).

The affected chips aren't the main processors, which are based on the so-called "Sandy Bridge" technology that Intel announced in January, but a support chip. The flaw means it may degrade with use over a period of months or years, slowing down the transfer of data to and from the computer's hard drives and DVD drives.
2010 Testarossa Dos Rubios Vineyard Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay ($39; 14.1%): The inaugural release of the Don Rubios bottling is rich and ripe, but balanced; well-behaved and showing some elegance for its age. A hint of vanilla and toasted grain, then a silky palate of lemony tree fruit. The 2010 Testarossa Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay ($32; 14.1%) has a brighter, sharper edge.
