This might chill the use of class-action lawsuits in some circumstances. But the decision does not broadly foreclose such suits. Arguably, it may provide a useful road map for smaller-scale, but still high-impact, class-action suits.
Teams don't build their rosters around players such as Cabrera. They look for players with broader backs -- Albert Pujols, Miguel Cabrera, Justin Verlander, Matt Kemp, Clayton Kershaw and Adrian Gonzalez. But Cabrera can make those teams better, which would seem to put him in line for a multiyear deal in the three to four-year range.

"Her powerful voice graced many memorable and award-winning songs," Portnow said. "A light has been dimmed in our music community today, and we extend our deepest condolences to her family, friends, fans and all who have been touched by her beautiful voice."
Second: The only way to wirelessly share Photo Journals from iPhoto is by first uploading them to iCloud, which generates a unique Web link to that Photo Journal. This link can then be shared with others by email, but it's frustrating that Apple didn't directly integrate a way to share these creations via Facebook, Flickr, SmugMug or other photo sites. The emails generate terribly long URLs that look ugly in Facebook and don't include any thumbnail images. A spokeswoman said Apple would address this issue in a software update.

-- Los Angeles Times: Neeson holds it together from first to last. He is the rumbly voiced king of the late-January/early February action film, per "Taken" and "Unknown," and by now moviegoers have been subliminally conditioned to pay money to hear that warm hearth of a speaking voice, under duress but coolly so, this time of year. Call "The Grey" "Deliverance"-lite, with snow, and wolves. And call it a solid January surprise.

Menendez’ plan also called for increasing incentives for adoption of natural gas vehicles; accelerating deployment of electric vehicles; keeping American oil in the U.S., rather than exporting it, and ending billions of dollars in tax breaks for big oil.

Still, the OWS folks are nothing if not creative and they will come up with something. The question is whether it will be relevant. Last fall, at the height of the protests that began in New York’s Zuccotti Park and sprang up in city after city, all the way to Oakland, Occupy Wall Street seized the attention of the nation and, for the first time in a couple of years, shifted the terms of debate from the tea party's obsession with big, bad government to the 99-to-1 split of wealth in the country.

My Sacramento sources tell me there was a deal worked up among Democrats to get something passed by the June 15 deadline, knowing the governor would want to redo parts of it, so lawmakers could keep receiving their salaries. But while the money was a motivating factor, it wasn't the biggest reason the Democrats went that route.
Besides, the real show is taking place to his left. In recovery from both alcohol abuse and cancer, Eddie Van Halen remains one of rock's wonders to behold, reeling off impossibly fleet-fingered solos and chunky power chords, still cracking his trademark smile as if his six-string pyrotechnics were no big deal. Though it was placed just before the finale, his dazzling solo spotlight was the show's musical and emotional epicenter.
Mandel says through a spokesman that there's a good reason his early trips were billed to his state political account: The new state treasurer was meeting with other treasurers and financial experts in order to better handle Ohio's expenditures and revenues. Even though these trips were for official business, parts of them also involved discussing politics — non-Senate politics, that is — so Mandel did the safe thing and used his state political account.
"We calculate that on the back of what we already know for services, construction and industrial production, a reading of 0.1% to 0.2% quarter on quarter for headline gross domestic product is likely," Mr. Clarke said. The U.K. economy grew 0.5% in the first quarter.

Economic conditions meant the company likely had trouble meeting the performance targets promised to lenders.

Among Harvey's qualifications are that he's been married three times and possibly gained some insights from his two ex-wives about how they failed to keep him. This is not a history to inspire confidence, but in the new movie "Think Like a Man," we're expected to believe that every woman in the film bought the book and started living her life according to it. The twist comes when the men in their lives discover their secret reading and study the book themselves. Now the men know the women's game plan.
In a statement, Franklin denied she was referring specifically to Cissy Houston’s parenting, saying that “Today” producers abbreviated the interview, cutting Franklin’s qualification: “This is no reflection on Cissy or Nippy’s upbringing.” The media, she says, “are more interested in sensationalism and negative speculations than the truth. Cissy does not need ridiculous speculation and neither do I — particularly at this time … Knowing Cissy as well as I do, I know Whitney left home right and properly.”

"She wants fans her own age," says Zach Hochkeppel, senior vice president of marketing at EMI Music and a member of the singer's Blue Note Records team from the start. Older audiences can be stodgy. "To maintain this über-adult fan base is really difficult. You have to do the same record over and over, or come up with stunts," such as standards collections or duets albums.
“It really allows you to focus on yourself, not so much prep work for the other team,” the Glen Burnie native and Old Mill graduate said. “We had two stretches where we went through three games in seven or eight days, and we really just focused on ourselves and executed and sharpened some things up and then not as much personnel work for the other team. We really focused on ourselves. So I think that plays to our strengths at times because we know how good we can be and if we just perfect the things we need to do, I think we can beat anybody we need to. So in terms of playing Denver on Wednesday, we’re going to come to work on Monday, we’re going to watch the game, we’re going to correct some things and then we’re going to get after it in practice on Monday.”

Take it all in. Your column on the Avalanche made several good points. But making no mention of Matt Duchene — possibly the most overrated, overpaid guy in the NHL, at best an underachiever — is to me irresponsible journalism. You have the numbers, I'm sure, and they will tell the sad tale. I contend not only does Duchene not contribute points-wise, he continues to look flashy, take an easily blocked shot or lose the puck. Instead you single out Paul Stastny, who is consistently a very good all-around player a lot of teams would like to have.
That hasn't been the only tinkering since the standards were last reviewed April 17. A rule requiring the city to get 24 hours notice of a spill has been pulled, saying instead the operator must give whatever notice is required by state and federal law.

It has been about a year since Jeter scrapped the swing changes he made with hitting coach Kevin Long, and nine months since his return from the disabled list.

But do the Blues have enough to keep pace with Detroit? Wednesday's victory pulled them even with the Red Wings atop the Central Division. The winner of the division will be guaranteed one of the top three seeds in the Western Conference, while the runner-up could finish only as high as fourth. The top four seeds receive home-ice advantage, and for the Blues, who are 26-4-4 at Scottrade Center and 14-13-3 on the road, that could be critical.
"That is 10,000 to 20,000 possible more homes needed this year. I hope it continues," said Michael Stoskopf, chief executive of the Building Industry Association of Southeastern Michigan. "I think we are seeing improvement, and part of that points to the number of people who have jobs."
Treats are important at a Halloween wedding — and not just for kids. “Definitely don’t forget the candy,” said Miller.

In 2003 Carol began writing a weekly column for the Chicago Tribune and was hired by the Chicago Sun-Times in August 2004.
Lawmaking is supposed to involve a balancing of competing interests in the public good: Make the regulation tight enough to protect the environment, for example, but not so tight that it squelches economic activity. But when an interest group writes a bill, there is no such balance. Only its interest is represented.
“We need to see them every day,” Lions coach Kert Fernandez said. “That’s motivational for these kids. It throws a little fuel on the fire.”
Finally, choose dairy that is either fat-free or low-fat to begin the day. Try to include milk or calcium-fortified soy milk at breakfast. If you are used to drinking whole milk, switch gradually to fat-free milk, and if you drink lattes or cappuccinos, ask for them with skim milk. Adding fat-free or low-fat milk to coffee and cereals will also help you avoid saturated fats.

The proposed rules would allow some pilots to fly more hours -- 10 instead of the current maximum of eight -- if they begin their day in the morning so that most of their flying takes place during the daytime. But pilots who fly overnight -- the busiest time of day for cargo carriers and military charters -- would be allowed fewer than eight hours because people naturally crave sleep during those hours.

Most dairy cows typically experience declining milk production by age 5 and are sent to slaughterhouses to be ground into hamburger. The FDA tests 40,000 of the nation's 35 million slaughtered dairy and beef cattle annually for BSE, targeting animals older than 30 months, when the disease is more likely to appear. However, there are cases of BSE that have been detected in cattle as young as 20 months.

Blessing wrote this play in 1999, by which time the firestorm generated by the National Endowment for the Arts' grants to four controversial individual performance artists (Karen Finley and Holly Hughes among them), as well as the funding of tax-supported museums exhibiting Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually graphic photographs, had subsided just a bit. But you can still smell the ache as well as the giddy delight in every sentence he wrote. And these days, even as politicians aim at larger targets, "Chesapeake" has the feel of a fresh wake-up call. (And, it must be said, Spalding Gray aside, Blessing, who is best known for his play "Into the Woods," writes far more brilliantly than the lion's share of performance artists around.)

Occupy Wall Street worked - kind of, for a while - because its message, that American society is stacked against the working man and the rich rig the system to benefit themselves, resonated in reality. Protests against NATO won't work because there's no reality to echo against. We could list our problems for a week and never get to NATO. In fact, I would wager that the general impression of NATO is positive: It's one of the few institutions that actually functions. The Soviet Union collapsed - a good thing, though maybe not to those who clung to the dream - and the powerful should try to prevent innocents from being slaughtered. That it isn't done perfectly is not an argument against trying.
The recent ruling by the Maryland Courts declaring pit bulls "inherently dangerous" is not only inhumane, it's simply not true ("Fallout from pit bull decision," May 2).

ANSWER: Wisdom teeth (third molars) were necessary eons ago when humans had a coarser diet and larger jaws. With evolution, our jaws have gotten relatively smaller and, in many cases, there isn't enough room for them to erupt fully or into a favorable position. Often, these teeth will only partially erupt, leaving a flap of tissue over a portion of the crown of the tooth. Food and bacteria get under this flap and cause an infection. Even if the teeth fully erupt, they are so far back in the mouth that it is difficult to keep them and the surrounding gums clean and healthy.
A 40-something woman who works out three days a week doesn't need 100 grams of protein a day. That's closer to what an athlete needs.

Here's how to calculate your clients' needs and your own -- we assume you, like them, are fairly active. Bump up the basic protein requirement to 0.5 grams per pound. For a 150-pound person, that's 75 grams of protein a day.

The three films demonstrate the variety of comedy. "The Artist" is a nearly silent, lighthearted romance set in the late 1920s and early '30s.

Management drew up a contingency plan for raising money fast, including halting lending completely, which would provide access to $1 billion, and selling life insurance policies it held on executives, with cash values of nearly $2 billion.
His claim for presidential apologies, however, is at odds with Obama's actual statements. We read through Obama's speeches and public remarks while traveling abroad but could not find a statement that included the words "sorry" or "apologize." Instead, Obama's remarks contained some criticism of past U.S. actions, but those passages were typically balanced by praise for American ideals, and Obama mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We've rated Romney's statement Pants on Fire.
But I realized with astonishment that it had been 40 years since I had expressed a feeling so spontaneously to a black person -- so pervasive and encompassing and overwhelming is the race-consciousness our society. Los Angeles and Simi Valley demonstrated how adept we have become, we whites, in shutting out our recognition of the essential humanity of all peoples, in consigning those of other races to their own worlds and living within our own.
But I would be NOT doing a good job if I did not mention that Kelly has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is hands down and flat out the greatest surfer who has ever lived. He has won nine World Championships and is on his way to an unbelievable 10th as we speak.

Experts say the increase in older Asian and Hispanic adults is partly due to the aging of immigrants who came to the U.S. for jobs or to seek refuge from war. Another reason is that some established immigrants are bringing parents from their native country. Also, some Asians and Hispanics have especially long life expectancies.

That may seem like a strange thing to say about "Tower Heist," a ridiculous, fun and funny caper film that is very much an ensemble piece, with Ben Stiller, Casey Affleck, Matthew Broderick, Michael Pena, Gabourey Sidibe and Tea Leoni sharing in the comedic spoils. It's a ludicrous story somewhat grounded in the raw feelings about the state of the economy, in which workers at an exclusive New York apartment high-rise seek to steal back at least some of the money from a Bernie Madoff-like figure (Alan Alda) who swindled them.

There might not be a team in the area that hasn't seen a hot-shooting team steal a win away with a late flurry of 3-point shots. A 10-point lead used to be golden. No more. Ten points is wobbly, 15 iffy and, while it might sound a bit paranoid, 20 may not even be iron-clad.

ø8. Philadelphia Eagles: All too often, the center of their defense proved the Achilles' heel in 2011. Coach Andy Reid clearly seems to understand that and traded up in Round 1 for highly regarded DT Fletcher Cox. After previously acquiring MLB DeMeco Ryans, Reid continued investing in the second level by getting Mychal Kendricks in Round 2 before landing another top-notch pass rusher in Vinny Curry. Fourth-round CB Brandon Boykin may even stem the loss of Asante Samuel. Dream Team part deux?

Perhaps no architect embodied the oddness of skyscraper architecture more than Minoru Yamasaki, the Seattle native who designed the 110-story World Trade Center towers. Yamasaki was afraid of heights; he made the windows of the twin towers just 18 inches wide to ease the fears of the people inside the buildings who shared his anxiety.

As for the suggestion that BackBid could turn the hotel industry hypercompetitive, I have only one thing to say to that: Now hotels know how it must have felt when Priceline burst onto the scene and consumers had to guess the winning rate when they made a "name your own price" bid. Many guests complained to me afterward, believing that they had overpaid. Hotels didn't care. Now they're getting their comeuppance, some might argue.

"I thought he was pressing early, looking for his offense and trying to make things happen. Now he's allowing his offense to come to him. That could be more minutes ... when he came off the bench he was trying to cram 30 minutes into 15-20. Now he's allowing the game to come to him offensively and he's getting to spots and making plays. We're not running a lot of plays for him; he's just playing off of guys. With more minutes he's been able to be more productive. I think he's back focused on what he does, which is defend and let the offense come to him."

The only thing better than a performance of Mahler's wonderful Symphony No. 2, "Resurrection," with David Robertson and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, is a performance of that work by those forces with Christine Brewer as the soprano soloist.

"The moshing back then, everyone was jumping up and down and everyone went in a flow," Tindall said. "Today, things have changed. They swing fists and they kick. We put a stop to it. We tell them, 'Do it again and you're gone.' We want kids to have fun and enjoy the show."

A: For us, when we started, we could get a five- to 15-week run in a city. That just doesn't happen to anybody anymore, even if the movie's doing really, really well and gets great reviews, and things like that. So if you're only running about two weeks, you're just about making your advertising back. The economic underpinnings of the independent-movie business have kind of just eroded. Economics change all the time, so it's not surprising. But there's not really an independent-movie business anymore.
But that hope appears to be a long shot, since the rules in Texas currently call for delegates there to be split proportionally. That means Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, could move closer to the number needed for the nomination even if he loses Texas, or other states with similar rules.
I appreciate everything that Darron Thomas has done for the program, which is A LOT! However, Bennett will make us somewhat forget about Thomas next year. The only real regret is that the Ducks won't have two starting-caliber quarterbacks on the roster.

The Wings have to adjust. They have no choice. As great as their penalty-kill has been lately, they struggle in a penalty-filled game. As Lidstrom said: Just our rotation, our rhythm, trying to get four lines going, it kind of kills that rhythm a little bit.

Carter and Malone turned in a tasty performance of "Samba de Orpheus" (from the 1959 film, "Black Orpheus") that included a transcendently eloquent bass solo.

We cannot imagine having this man as our son-in-law and do not like the message he would send to our future grandchildren, but we do not want to stop communicating with our daughter either.
In his latest volume, Johnson meets his political match in the person of John F. Kennedy. Hesitant to seek—and potentially lose—the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960, Johnson spends all of 1959 denying his ambitions, while Kennedy spends every free moment courting delegates. When Kennedy wins on the first ballot, Wyoming, a state once thought certain to support Johnson, puts him over the top.

Now, the president's likability doesn't mean Mr. Romney shouldn't go on the offensive. It does mean he ought to attack hardest where Mr. Obama is at his weakest: his failed policies. For all the carping about Mr. Romney, this part he gets. We can see it reflected in both his embrace of the opportunity-oriented Republicanism of Wisconsin's Paul Ryan—and his repeated refrain that Mr. Obama is simply "in over his head."

When I was in college in the early ’80s, it wasn’t like everyone who was interested in rock music knew about Eno. But I can’t recall anyone ever hearing those four song albums and not becoming a fan. I imagine it’s still very much the same way.
Cable networks, on the other hand, think mostly about their own game plan when scheduling their scripted shows. A cable network like TNT or USA typically branches out into original programming night by night, scheduling at least two shows together to create a "destination."

They were persuasive. I decided that my job was done at OLPC: I made the laptop they said couldn't be made and, if we could get this technology into other devices, I could solve the next big problems.

"I've made one major chocolate creation for every year since we opened the shop," Rochoux said.
Answer - At 18 months, an infant has a vocabulary of about 15 words. After the 2-year mark, the vocabulary expands to 50 to 100 words. As far as the pacifier being the cause for a small vocabulary, I can't find any reliable information implicating it.

"While it is unfortunate that the residents of the fourth legislative district will not have full representation in the Assembly until the Supreme Court ultimately decides the case, we believe that the final outcome will be that the voters will have their choice honored and Ms Mosquera will be the Assemblywoman, Tambussi said.

He said Obama had no choice but to accede to Republican demands for continuing existing rates for the wealthy in order to spare higher rates for the middle class. He also said the president was forced to make concessions to protect the jobless.
Whedon writes with a perfect ear for each character's personality. What could have been a Babel of competing voices becomes almost musical counterpoint. There's Captain America's old-school idealism, Thor's flowery Elizabethan diction, and secret agent Black Widow's Bourne-like remorse for her ruthless past. Tony Stark's arch sarcasm, which wore thin in the previous Iron Man movie, is used here in effective small doses. When the robo-warrior grabs super-archer Hawkeye by the collar and warns "Clench up, Legolas" before jetting them both sky-high, the gag cracks like a bullwhip.
Nationstar has been bulking up with cash in recent weeks, going public and then closing Wednesday on $275 million of senior notes due in 2019.

For proof, Levy pointed to his own decision to blog his hospital's rates of pneumonia for patients on ventilators, a condition with a 30 percent death rate. Doctors squawked at the idea, saying patients wouldn't understand. But patients didn't really look much. Instead, Levy said, the publicity spurred staff to make changes lowering the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, such as setting the heads of patient beds at 30-degree angles.

Sale was the beneficiary of home runs by Alejandro De Aza and A.J. Pierzynski in the first that staked him to a 3-0 lead. De Aza's homer was the first leadoff homer by a Sox player since Scott Podsednik at Detroit on Oct. 2, 2009.
The deal also forecloses on one of the best, lowest-cost opportunities for increasing refuge water supply and achieving a sustainable water balance in the Klamath. To protect a sweetheart deal for a small group of irrigators, the settlement attempts to perpetuate commercial leaseland farming on 22,000 acres of Tule Lake and Lower Klamath refuges and asks taxpayers to subsidize this harmful practice. In contrast, phasing out this federally managed program, using those lands to store winter water, and using the 1905 priority date water rights associated with those lands for fish and wildlife purposes would represent a huge step toward a sustainable Klamath Basin -- at a fraction of the cost of the settlement deal.
I attended as part of a story about Portland resident Debi Coleman who is one of the "Leap" co-producers.

The facts aren't on the county's side on this one. The law isn't, either: Open-records laws require a reasonable charge, commensurate with cost, for copying public records. And the Ohio attorney general ruled long ago that the charge for duplicating a microfiche containing multiple documents is the cost of the microfiche, not the documents.
The 300 passengers were transferred to another train by 9:18 a.m., she said. The accident happened before the rail lines narrow to one track to enter the tunnel, so the second train was able to pull alongside the disabled train on a parallel track. The rescue train then continued on toward Trenton.
If you guessed that Chiang is the Golden State's controller, you get high marks (and extra wonk credit if you can list what, precisely, the controller does). Chiang became much more controlling than the average controller after voters passed Proposition 25 in November 2010, the initiative that wisely did away with the two-thirds vote requirement for the Legislature to pass a budget. It also contained a less-heralded provision declaring that lawmakers' pay would be withheld if they failed to pass a budget by the June 15 constitutional deadline.

How many coaches have claimed they weren't going anywhere while their wives were already house hunting in another market (Nick Saban)? How many players have claimed how much they love the city they were playing in and wanted nothing more to be finish their careers there (Dwight Howard) while their agent tried to facilitate a trade?
But in the meantime, he expects there to continue to be a market -- albeit a shrinking one -- for DVD rentals. Redbox will pick up a lot of that demand. But Blockbuster can still be a player with its more extensive in-store selection compared to Redbox's limited titles, he said.

A year ago, the Missouri Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill to give firefighters the same, so long as they lived within an hour of their home fire station.

Would you drive more than four hours for biscuits and gravy, especially if they come with a side of Old Florida? The restaurant at the historic lodge at Wakulla Springs State Park, about 20 miles south of , serves some of the best Southern breakfast fare we've ever had. But that's not the only reason to go there. The kids will love to gaze at Old Joe, the stuffed 11-foot alligator in the lobby that was pulled from the springs way back when. The adults will love sitting in the comfy chairs, soaking in the atmosphere that seems little changed from when the lodge was built in 1937. There's even an old-fashioned soda counter for ice cream cones. In the summer, cool off in the springs, where the water temperature is about 70 even in August. Hike nature trails and go on the Jungle Cruise, a boat trip along the Wakulla River where you'll see alligators, deer, osprey, turtles and sun-basking anhingas with their wings spread wide. The Creature From the Black Lagoon was filmed here and Johnny Weissmuller swung from the trees in his Tarzan movies. Lodging is about $100 a night and there's a $6 entry fee to the park.

Payroll processor ADP said that U.S. businesses added 119,000 jobs in April, far fewer than the 201,000 added in March. However, investors will probably wait until Friday, when the government releases its own data on April jobs, before drawing any firm conclusions about the month. The ADP number covers only private-sector hiring and can vary sharply from the government’s number.

Prenzler, who was at the meeting, said he sold the federal agency 'step-up" bonds because their purchase during the tenure of his predecessor, Frank Miles, violated an internal office policy limiting investment maturities to 10 years.

Ignoring caution, my husband, Greg, and I decided to return to the islands, our first visit in 10 years. We were drawn by the Savusavu Music Festival, an annual event that brings in music groups from all over the South Pacific, and we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.

An early version of the Treasury department rule protected people from having their federal benefits frozen by debt collectors -- including private collection agencies and states seeking back child support.
To find the best sweet corn from a local stand or at the farmer’s market, ask the farmer when it was picked - you'll ideally want corn that was harvested within the past 24 hours for maximum sweetness and tender kernels. You don’t need to peel back every cob to get the best pickings - rather, gently squeeze the cob through the husks to feel for bruising or denting in the middle of the cob. I don’t worry about imperfections at the top of the cobs - once peeled back those can easily be cut off before preparing.

He's still not sure how to react when Reyes walks into Citi Field for the first time Tuesday afternoon as a member of the Miami Marlins. Throughout all of last season, the thought of Reyes wearing a color scheme other than royal blue and orange seemed to be a formality.

The iPro is designed much like a conventional interchangeable lens system. The kit includes a wide-angle lens and a fisheye that provides a circular 160-degree view. They're bayonet-style lenses: they click firmly into a mount on a special case that your iPhone needs to wear. When the lenses aren't in use, they stow safely inside a screw-together cylinder that's sturdy enough to protect them against any degree of abuse. The cylinder also screws into the iPhone case and can serve as a handle (to stabilize video), or provide a standard tripod mount.

I think Anna's movement has been fantastic. It's everything I wanted to happen. In fact it's happened a little sooner than I expected. At the same time, I think it's not exactly a "revolution." It was only a successful protest since the former goes on for a while. Two years back when I started writing columns, I would have been considered a lunatic for imagining the India I would like to see. But when I see a movement like this, I think there are plenty of people who want an equal society based on excellence. It's very nice that the youth lent their time and energy to the cause. But you can't fix a nation in 10 days. The youth has to be prepared to sacrifice more if they want to see a better nation.

You're all about sports, and you've scored tickets to see the Clippers or Kings or Lakers at Staples Center, next to the L.A. Live entertainment complex near the southern end of downtown. Congratulations, especially if those are Laker seats. Now, there are more than a dozen restaurants and bars in L.A. Live, not to mention the Grammy Museum, a JW Marriott Hotel and a Ritz-Carlton, both of which opened in 2010. But that's not where you're sleeping. You're heading eight blocks northeast to the Los Angeles Athletic Club, which has 72 hotel rooms that many people have never heard about. From the outside, the LAAC is a humdrum hulk among the gem merchants that make up downtown's Jewelry District, but inside, it's a piece of sweat-soaked L.A. history, with two restaurants and bars, pools, weights, squash courts, basketball courts and walls crowded with fascinating old artworks and photos. Book a room and you get the same access that the club's members do. (Yes, male and female, adults and children.) The hotel rooms, upgraded from 2007-2009, are dark, woodsy and clubby. For less than the cost of a room at the Marriott or Ritz, you can walk and run in the footsteps of Esther Williams, and Johnny Weissmuller and dozens of less-celebrated Olympic medalists. ( Charlie Chaplin spent a lot of time here too.) Alas, the indoor pool's high dive is no more, but you can still peek through the underwater window that diving coaches used to watch their protégés splash down.

The mortgage settlement, announced in February, was filed in court last week. It's expected to send nearly $1 billion in total to Maryland — the sixth-largest state payment out of $25 billion nationwide. Most is earmarked for loan modifications such as principal reduction and for refinancing borrowers who are underwater on their mortgages. Victims of "unfair servicing practices" who were foreclosed on between 2008 and last year also will receive payments of $1,800 to $2,000.

Nothing wrong with dreaming. Heck, three NFL teams drafted four rookie starters just last year. Of course, those teams had a collective 40 picks to pull off the feat. The Bears have six selections, and they are choosing late in rounds as punishment for an 11-5 season that included hosting - and losing - the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers. The Bears fielded one rookie starter in that game, right tackle J'Marcus Webb, a seventh-round pick.

Congress has passed various restrictions on U.S. aid in Pakistan after Osama bin Laden was found hiding within its borders.
