Now Afghanistan has turned the Democrats into a war party, mostly against their will and certainly against the inclinations of President Obama, who is obviously of a new generation that has no taste for continuous conflict. The pain of personally waging war has been diverted to a very small percentage of the population, by some estimates around 1%. Without a universal draft of the sort that created a vocal antiwar faction in the Vietnam era, it's up to the center-left to pronounce the truth: America should scale down its military on all fronts. We should become more peaceful in deed rather than just in speech.

Of course, there are other potential kinds of electoral fraud; crooked poll workers, for example, could record votes in the names of citizens who actually stayed home. Election officials could design ballots in a way that worked to a specific candidate's advantage or disadvantage (see Florida, 2000). But none of this would be prevented by photo ID, which still hasn't found a problem to solve  except, perhaps, an excess of Democratic voters.

I'm getting there in my campaign to see Oscar-nominated films. With "Long Voyage Home," I've now seen all 10 of the 1940 best-picture nominees: "All This, And Heaven Too;" "Foreign Correspondent;" "The Grapes of Wrath;" "The Great Dictator;" "Kitty Foyle;" "The Letter;" "Our Town;" "The Philadelphia Story;" and "Rebecca" — two Alfred Hitchcock films, two John Ford movies, two Bette Davis flicks. The Oscar went to "Rebecca," which was Hitchcock's first American feature. Even today, I would vote for that movie over "Grapes of Wrath" and "Philly Story," which probably came in second and third in the voting. (I wish they'd tell the order of finish in every category except then, in movie trailers, we'd see, like, "starring second-place actor Edward Norton.")

Manufacturing has provided much of the fuel for the U.S. recovery since the recession ended roughly three years ago. American manufacturing expanded last month at the fastest pace in 10 months. New orders rose to the highest level in a year, a signal of more production in coming months. Export orders also rose, despite worries that weaker economies in Europe and China could hold back U.S. exports.
"With respect to Iraq in particular, I salute your courageous leadership that changed the national debate and helped make Iraq the central issue of this historic election,'' Pelosi wrote to Murtha in the letter disclosing her intent to vote for him.

Wine pairings, which were featured with the three-course menu for $35 a person, are hit or miss. In many cases, it felt as if no one had actually tasted the wines with Joel Huff's creations. While there are six sakes, a wider variety would be appropriate for the tenor of the menu. In addition, the staff didn't seem to know the list very well.
It is inconceivable to me that outsourcing our fine Police Department would even be a topic for discussion. These men and women protect us, not because it's their job, but because they actually care about the well-being of the citizens of this town. They have a vested interest in keeping the streets of Pacifica safe. Do you honestly think an outside agency would care nearly as much as our Police Department does? Give me a break! Simply put, you can't put a price tag on our safety. If the ballot measure was allowed to go through and it didn't pass, then so be it. But for you to not even allow us the opportunity is shameful, careless and irresponsible.

Even though it was there all the time (for the moon does not rotate), it wasn't easy to see the distant Earth from the lunar surface. The astronauts' visors gave them only a limited field of vision, and in any case they were kept busy for almost every minute -- the mission plans did not allow for sightseeing. "In the three days of exploration," recalled Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, "there were a couple of times when I actually looked up to see the Earth -- and it was a difficult maneuver in that bulky suit." Neil Armstrong, was kept awake at Tranquillity Base by the Earth shining down through the onboard telescope "like a big blue eyeball"; it was so small that he could blot it out with his thumb. He was asked later if this made him feel big. "No," he replied, "it made me feel really, really small." Even on the moon, Armstrong identified with the Earth.
Officials from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services say that it's impossible to tell how many Arizona firms are using E-Verify. Some firms have out-of-state human-resources or payroll departments, so their E-Verify check may be credited to another state.

Terrorists have stolen four prototypes of the device, so the movie gives voice to a Japanese theme that goes all the way back to "Godzilla," a monster spawned by the atom bomb -- the loss of control over scientific creations. At the same time, Satoshi Kon, whose previous film was the remarkable "Tokyo Godfathers," uses the complex plot as a pretext for joyous psychedelia. Images tumble and flow, as if truly in a dream, from subconscious minds stuffed like junk shops with toys, dolls, circus animals, parade floats, pop artifacts and surreal movie scenes that suggest next year at Marienbad. The abundance is almost mad, and madly enjoyable.

The Seaside Singers will also climb onboard the Mildred Owen Concert Hall stage to offer their voices in salute of Mother Earth. Included among their songs will be an original arrangement of Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." Twenty singers all (including bass Emmanuel Williams), the Seaside Singers are under the baton of founder and singer Judy Tugendreich. The choir got their start in Pacifica and have lived by these simple rules since day one — have a previous background of singing in a church or school choir, have a basic knowledge of how music works (notation, rhythm and so on), know how to blend your voice, have a real love of a beautiful choral sound, be willing to take on the challenge of hard work and enjoy the camaraderie that comes with all of this. Anyone who has ever heard the Seaside Singers sing, for instance at their annual Pacifica Performances "Festival of Holiday Music," their Pacifica Performances Spring Concert, or perhaps just recently at the Pacifica Pier Poetry Walk, knows this is a choral group that got their wish — lovely artistry melding in beautiful voices, plus they are a hoot!

Trieu on Dawson: "It was deserved. There were very good offensive linemen there and it was clear he was dominant.

"The Drowned Cities" is not for the faint of heart or possibly even for readers at the lower end of the recommended reader age spectrum. It is far more violent even than "The Hunger Games" conclusion, "Mockingay." The action is oftentimes barbaric. Amputations are common. Even more bodies pile up as a result of atrocities committed with acid and, of course, guns. Many of the book's minor characters delight in torturing their victims, pouring flesh-eating chemicals down bare-skinned backs and smashing their faces into the dirt. At one point Mahlia notes that surviving only creates more killing.

Your contribution will not only provide student scholarships for our DC trip, but bring professional musicians to the classroom to work with our students, recording equipment to record our students' artistry, entrance fees to area music festivals, and musical instruments to ensure that no student that has a desire to study music at Beckman High School is ever turned away for lack of financial resources," said Director Jim Kollias.

Jump back to Euclid Avenue for a moment. The renovated Baker Building at East 71st Street has filled up with companies graduating from incubators. A suburban-style technology park is going up a few blocks away, because the developer sees a market for offices and labs close to the universities and hospitals along the Euclid Corridor.

Along the way you'll drive through a stand of massive live oaks, their branches forming a canopy over the road. I started my visit to Charleston with two nights at the Sanctuary. Activities offered during my stay included a naturalist-led gator walk ($12 for 90 minutes), a family kayaking excursion through the island's tidal creeks ($50 for two hours) and an adult twilight kayak paddle ($50 for two hours). I hopped on a rental bike one morning and rode 8 miles on the beach in search of dolphins, which usually gather in an inlet to feed at high tide.

Our introduction to the new Old Mazatlán was the Angela Peralta Theater, built in 1870 as the Teatro Rubio opera house, where we were mesmerized by the Delfos Contemporanean dance company. Four men and four women metamorphosed from free-form sprites to self-destructing harridans to feathered warriors to tuxedoed and gowned dancers executing something between flamenco and a river-dance stomp.

Wirth admitted that he and Damiani often recorded personal expenses as business expenses, understating the company's income for tax purposes. From 2002 through 2005, he claimed a salary of just $12,000 on his W-2 forms, although the true amount of income was thousands more. In some cases, the trio allegedly claimed bogus "management fees" on their taxes in an effort to reduce the company's taxable income to nearly zero.

Consumers, however, may not have the same reaction. Cable sports channels are already among the most expensive sources of programming. ESPN, for example, costs cable and satellite operators more than $5 a month per subscriber, according to industry consulting firm SNL Kagan. (The USA Network channel, for comparison, costs just over 60 cents a month per subscriber.) Much of that cost is passed on to the consumer. If another channel emerges and drives bills even higher, there could be renewed calls that high-priced sports channels should be sold as separate packages instead of being bundled into basic cable service.
Marcher Bahran Admadi, a former taxi driver and art dealer who is now unemployed, said he has "nothing personal" against the rich. "But some of them take people's blood," he said. "Everything goes up the ladder while we work harder and harder."

Q: What will you miss most about your job?
That's the kind of question we'd like to hear asked more often, by Congress and the courts. The drone program is so secretive that until last week it was not officially acknowledged to exist; President Obama changed that in an online appearance in which he insisted that drone attacks "have not caused a huge number of civilian casualties."
horrible injuries that pretty much wiped out the team's supply of cornerbacks. If Kroenke wants to be kind, he can cite several factors to justify the poor season. He can cut Spagnuolo a break. Kroenke can even suggest that the organization's problems are above the coaching level. Kroenke could come to believe that the offense will improve dramatically in 2012 after QB Sam Bradford and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels have a full year, a full offseason, of preparation. You should always keep this in mind: Kroenke wanted to hire Spagnuolo. He was on board with the decision. Again, I don't rule anything out here.
Belinda Chlouber has been creating mixed-media works inspired by poems and short stories written by her mother, Carla Chlouber, who passed away last year, and by her grandfather, Arthur Sweet. Bits of the poetry also are included in small monoprints she is showing.

Last year, Whistleblower described how Consumer Reports had awarded that infamous title to the First Premier Bank MasterCard, which charged up to $175 in fees for a $700 credit limit.

In addition, Romney has probably been damaged by the primary process and the need to tack right on social issues and immigration. The rather odd spectacle of candidates discussing the availability of contraception and how it should be covered by insurance, for example, may have particularly alienated some independent women voters.

As a former school board member, I have been one of the "they," and Sinquefield is just wrong. In my second year on the Ferguson-Florissant school board, we terminated more than 80 teachers, including a large number of veteran tenured teachers.

Obama didn't quite go all the way -- he didn't say "too many people of color are in prison" -- but the implication was clear. He went further in his Trayvon Martin remarks by implying that a son of his who looked like Trayvon could have met the same end. He never used the word "black." But his grave tone and choice of words had the ring of morality, stressing the idea of justice being done, advising us all to do some soul-searching. Most striking was how rattled the president appeared to be; for the master of cool, this truly seemed personal. It was a rare moment in which the normally abstract issues of black American injustice had a face, one of the most famous in the world.

Even if that transaction was kept from the city and the public until after the fact, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's administration should, in retrospect, have seen some warning signs.

The inexperience of those managers at putting on major events, much less an IndyCar race, should also have been a red flag.

The combination isn't really so strange. At root, both engineering and writing are disciplines of combining small things (pieces of steel, or words) to assemble a larger, more pleasing and useful thing (a cruise ship, or "Moby-Dick"). And many of the skills that one learns for engineering a machine carry over into engineering a tale. Here are three.
"The Greek elections unnerved the market," Andrew Slimmon, managing director at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, told the Wall Street Journal. "It's also the timing of all this.

If America does it, I believe other people will follow."

As he spoke, I set aside the legal pad I been jotting down occasional notes on and just began to listen. It was easily the most remarkable story I had heard in 25 years as a journalist. It was also a story that I would soon learn would perhaps never be written. Jimmy was scared. He called me a few weeks later and told me to drop it. He was worried what people would think of him. “Buddy had a lot of friends,” he explained. “What are they going to think?” He was also worried that he would find himself in jeopardy with the law. I told him I understood. I did not hear from him until a year later, when he called me up and told me he was ready. When the profile I wrote of him appeared in the Daily News in June 2006, the fears he had were washed away by a flood of supportive emails. When I spoke with him later, it was as if an anvil had been lifted from his back.

But there doesn’t appear to be much hope for immediate improvement. Winter’s questionable tactics, his inability to get the most out of his players and the TFC’s nonexistent defense don’t inspire much confidence.

GAME NOTEBOOK: Ten of Washington's 11 postseason games have been decided by one goal. ... Lundqvist finished with 23 saves. ... With his 29th career postseason goal, Ovechkin trails Peter Bondra by one for first all-time in franchise history. ... Ovechkin was also whistled for a two-minute charging penalty on defenseman Dan Girardi after the Russian left his feet to deliver the blow. Should the NHL take a closer look at the hit, Ovechkin is a previous offender and may suffer a stiffer penalty.

They are always going to be the Yankees, and the only way the Orioles are going to ever be considered an elite team again is by beating the elite teams on a regular basis. They should have won last night. The opportunities were there and they wasted another terrific performance by new starting pitcher Jason Hammel, so it's fair to wonder if they missed their best chance to take a win out of Yankee Stadium this week.
Ryan Kesler, as usual, fulfilled that role when the Canucks tied it, 1-1, on their first power play goal of the series. Quick couldn't see Alexander Edler's drive from the right point.
Some storm chasers, Harris reported May 16, essentially rent the good names of established Ohio home-repair contractors by paying the hometown contractor a flat fee, or a percentage of the repair billings the storm chaser collects. Thus, an out-of-state storm chaser can pass itself off as an established local business with a reputation for good work. That helps a storm chaser generate far more business than it otherwise might.

The issues
The full Senate will take up the committee's report Friday morning, Miller said.
Frank Deford, SI.com: "The Marlins seldom make sense and usually in a comic mode. Like last year, they had an 80-year-old manager. That is so zany. The Marlins are usually a terrible team, but, incredibly, every few years, like the cicadas coming out of the ground, they mysteriously reappear before their erstwhile handful of fans, make the wild card and actually win the World Series. One year they whipped the absolutely un-zany Yankees themselves. Another time they denied poor Cleveland its first championship since 1948 by winning in the 11th inning of the seventh game. Then, after the Marlins win, all the good players disappear, and the team goes back into the ground for a few more years. It is reliably reported to be reappearing this season. After all, the Marlins have somehow managed to get a new stadium built with money from who knows where at a time when every other structure in Miami-Dade County is in foreclosure. Oh, did I tell you the SEC is investigating the stadium deal? Only Los Zanyos could get the SEC involved in baseball."

How, then, to illustrate the essence of a Tyler character like Aaron Woolcott, whimsical narrator of "The Beginner's Goodbye"? How to indicate in a visual way the particular character of Aaron's thinking — which is hesitant, diffident, roundabout, but finally stubborn and self-assured? A lot goes on in a Tyler story, but it's not the kind of action that lends itself to pictures. A graphic novel based on "The Beginner's Goodbye" would consist of little more than a tree, a stethoscope, a book and a swing set. Everything else happens inside Aaron's mind.

Since the days of Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, radicals have talked of the "propaganda of the deed" -- the use of dramatic, usually violent, acts to inspire the masses and topple the existing order. The method -- targeting symbolic landmarks to create powerful images -- is now familiar. The killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The first World Trade Center attack. The Oklahoma City bombing. And 9/11 itself.

So that was another baseball season. This one sure didn’t end as well for me as last year did, but it still kept me up late, night after night, watching the West Coast feed on MLB. tv. Nothing makes me jump on the Internet first thing in the morning like baseball does, or get me to check updated boxscores in real time. So accustomed am I to the unceasing feed of baseball statistics that it blows my mind to remember how I lived when I was growing up in the ‘80s. No Internet, no SportsCenter, nothing but too-brief clips of the local teams on the 11 o’ clock news. I was no less of a fan then than I am now. But in order to stay informed about how my favorites were doing, I had to get lucky. I had to catch that first precious at-bat of the game when the totals were flashed on the screen (and if you wanted anything but triple crown numbers, forget it). If I missed that, I was out of luck, and I might have to wait until the Sunday paper was out, when I could scan the huge, monolithic list of batters arranged by average. As an East Coast fan obsessively following a team that played on the West Coast, I often had to wait two days to find out what happened -- when I broke open my copy of the Ledger in the cafeteria lunchroom, the game would have the dreaded (n) next to it. That meant it finished too late for the final edition of the newspaper. Giants fans spent the whole year 24 hours behind. Following the Orioles and Royals, my other teams, was hardly easier.

Cancer seems to be heading in a new direction. This isn't due, in large part, to declining rates, which tend to be modest. Last week the Centers for Disease Control issued a report noting that overall rates had dropped in the U.S. for the fourth straight year, but the decrease hovers at around 1.5% annually. The real news in the report was that two-third of cancers may be preventable. That number divides about equally between cancers due to smoking (the overwhelming cause of lung cancer) and cancers linked to obesity and lack of exercise (linked to cancer of the uterus, colon, kidney, pancreas, and breast cancer in post-menopausal women). Only the remaining one-third are linked to genetic mutations from all other causes, including toxins, radiation, environmental influences, etc.
