Epically restless, loud and with a gore-sentimentality ratio John Woo might envy, the South Korean '30s-'40s-era war extravaganza "My Way" is combative to a thematic and stylistic extreme. It details the competitive tug of war between a haughty Japanese scion Tatsuo (Joe Odagiri) living in occupied Korea, and the servant family's son Jun-shik (Jang Dong-gun), who each excel at marathon running. Their road from rivals to friends is told over numerous lengthy, Cuisinart-edited scenes of chaotic struggle, small-world reunions and preposterously whisker-thin escapes.

The 2010 NFL season was played with a funhouse mirror effect: Down was up, up was down, parity was alive and so was a 7-9 division champion. But in a season of anomalies - 19 overtime games, the Lions winning - none stood out quite like this: One year after both top playoff seeds advanced to the Super Bowl, the top seeds were eliminated in their first game, and both sixth-seeded teams advanced to Sunday's conference championship games.

After "Bandstand," Clark's most famous stage mark might be in Times Square, where he helped ring in a new broadcast tradition in 1972.

The Tigers' attack was led by Brendel, who had eight kills, Wolken (seven kills), Sarah Makowski (five kills), Leonard (four) and Carissa Schmidt (four). Sarah Stepp (18 assists) and Kayla Reeg (12 assists) did a good job moving the ball around.
One of Obama's most popular promises in 2008 echoed one made by George W. Bush in 2000: Each pledged to change the tone of Washington. The fact neither succeeded cannot stop the efforts to try. Overheated rhetoric and political paralysis won't solve America's problems. What apparently looks just fine from the Senate floor is profoundly disappointing anywhere else.
Beaverton, a Class 6A quarterfinalist last season, had won eight in a row. Junior guard Alexis Montgomery, averaging 23 points, has been the catalyst for a team that has three freshmen in the rotation.

Perhaps if the people of Liberia learned the truth about their former leader, attitudes would change.
-- On the contestant who made motorcycle jackets and said he doesn't think women know enough to comment on men's clothing: "I was shocked (that) in this day and age someone would actually have the thought that maybe women shouldn't have an opinion about things (and that he) would go so far and voice it on television. If you think as a designer you have it already figured out, this is not the show for you. Even beyond that, I felt like him making that comment made me also question his business savvy: This is a huge opportunity for you and you've managed to melt it down."

Staying in character: The finish materials in the reworked kitchen don't scream shiny and new. The cabinets are made of local quartersawn white oak; the island is granite with a leathered surface, and the countertops are honed black granite. "Nothing is polished. It looks like it's been there," Hansen said. Julie needed a little convincing when it came to the wood choice. "I kept saying, 'I don't want oak,'" she said. "I was picturing '80s oak," honey-colored and heavily grained. But after Hansen told her he intended to match the cabinets to an antique buffet the family already owned, Julie was convinced. "He showed me, and I said, 'That I like,'" she recalled. "He clearly had a vision for this kitchen."

But there are three things about your story that I find troubling, and that Enterprise had nothing to do with. First, you found scratches on the car. Why didn't you note them on your rental agreement? Talk is cheap. You can almost be guaranteed that the person checking you in won't be handling your return. So what if the second employee doesn't know about the 4-inch rule?
The USGS lists 73 Cottonwood Creeks in Colorado. The famous Clear Creek rises west of Golden, but we've got one up here, too, and there are at least 10 others. Cherry Creek?

Club basketball has a reputation of being "a bunch of thrown-together all-star teams" with no unity, discipline, or fundamentals. This is true in many states, and is somewhat true in Colorado, but we also have a proud tradition of grass roots clubs that are not all-star squads but teams that have played together for years and now that consistency and chemistry is paying off for these club teams that have stayed together for multiple seasons.

Army Dave and his wife were the second team at the Roadblock. Border Patrol completed it too easily. Maybe some nights on the border are a little too quiet, you know what I’m saying?

Great long chunks of the evening sat there inertly, while others got brushed over too quickly. Pacing and emphasis plagued the show throughout. One episode after another staggered around in vain search of a payoff. He overshared a favored horse's fate, a misadventure with a Pontiac and an encounter with a gorilla. Some tantalizing material, meanwhile, went underexplored. Surely there is more to say about a mother who explained her teetotaling by remarking, "Alcohol interferes with my suffering."

Or change the perspective from which the picture is seen, and switch a photo back and forth between 2-D and 3-D. That's why it calls the images "living pictures."

When an offender goes missing, officials put out a nationwide warrant. Corrections investigators look at the convict's prison visitor list and read to see who they corresponded with and find old addresses. They put the fugitive's picture on a website. They interview friends and relatives. They get tips from the public on a phone hotline and through e-mail. Often, they said, girlfriends who become annoyed by their fugitive boyfriends will help break a case.

She has said some ludicrous things lately, at least by conventional standards. On a conservative radio show, she bonded with the wing nuts on the phony issue about President Barack Obama's place of birth, declaring that "it's a fair question" to wonder whether he was born on American soil.

A: I don't know. There's no secret to it. The scenes are written, the words are on the page and you make it as realistic as you can. I was lucky in that sense that I was working with Emily, because she's so fun and lovely and easy to work with, and very like me in terms of how we approach the work. We got on like a house on fire. We just had a real laugh, and she's a funny girl. She makes you laugh. For three months we were just in stitches all the time. So when it came to doing scenes, it was easy.

The memorabilia sale scandal of Big Ten championship rings and game-day gear by players at Ohio State for money and discount tattoos, and even its cover-up, amounted to comparatively small potatoes. But if the Buckeyes did not measure up then, who's to say, with a hearty embrace of their raffish side, they might not set the standard in the future?
Large man who can move. Quick off the ball — clocked 1.64 in 10-yard split at combine - then relies on brute strength. Can push the pocket.

The equation was simple. Our friend needed help with chores she couldn't do, and our son was willing to give it a try. This summer's heat had caused weeds to grow in her yard with amazing tenacity.

"Patriarch Grove looks like a nursery for bristlecones," he said of the stand that's about 12 miles beyond Schulman Grove. "A lot of new shoots are springing up.

At first, Ford said, he and his students relied on freeze-dried food. Add water, eat it. It was fine, he said, but it didn't create community. A few years ago, he and base camp leader Jodi Thill, a physical education teacher, took a course in back country pantry-style cooking. Now students in groups of four plan their meals and pack whole ingredients. They sit around the camp stoves and create the meals together. Groups do taste-tests and "marvel at each other's creations," he said. "That has been the number one improvement in my trips. It's dramatically changed the trips."

The problem under the old maintenance of effort law was that the penalty for non-compliance was the withholding of state school aid the next year — effectively, double-punishing students for county officials' decisions. Under the new law, the state can, instead, intercept county income tax revenue and send it straight to the school system. It also allows counties to break property tax caps if the money goes to meeting maintenance of effort. Mr. Leopold complains now that school funding is crowding out other services; he may like the alternatives even less.

Ide disputes that the code update occurred because of the city's franchise fees negotiations with the county. "We'd been talking for a long time about making that change.

A: My condolences on your loss. Most airlines refund tickets -- even nonrefundable ones -- when a passenger dies. What's more, it's highly unusual for a representative to "admit" that the airline will profit from the death of a passenger. Maybe the representative you reached was having a bad day. I certainly hope so.

As Wright notes, their balancing act between religion and modernity can make Western observers uncomfortable. Her depiction of young Muslim women, "committed to their faith, firm about their femininity, and resolute about their rights," will spark some qualms in non-Muslim feminists. They may find themselves cynical about the assertion that "hejab is now about liberation, not confinement" and troubled by one activist's admission that "it's a deal between a Muslim girl and society. I agree that I will wear hejab in order to have more space and freedom in return." Wright is perhaps overly optimistic about female empowerment via Muslim modesty, a criticism that could also be made of her implicit suggestion that cultural ferment facilitates political progress. But her central contention is unassailable: it's not for outsiders to determine the shape of change in Islamic societies.

(Only for the first couple of days.)

Enter auto-sharing firm Zipcar. Founded in 2000, it grew by focusing on cities and college campuses.

The activists argue that the impounding of vehicles is an unnecessary burden on undocumented immigrants, who by state law cannot obtain drivers licenses. The city charges $190 when it impounds a vehicle, and the owner must also pay towing and storage fees to retrieve it. State law requires the vehicles of unlicensed drivers to be impounded for 30 days, which can add more than $1,000 in fees. That's a lot of money for immigrants working at low-wage jobs to support their families, the activists argued.

HARD CHOICES
"The Hour": This utterly addictive British series finishes its too-brief first season of six episodes. Set in London in the mid-1950s, the show focuses on three people involved in making a BBC hourlong news program -- and involved with each other. Dominic West ("The Wire") plays the show's handsome anchor; Romola Garai is the producer, who's also carrying on a secret affair with the married anchor; and Ben Whishaw is the reporter, digging into stories of government espionage, hidden secrets and murder, all of which powerful forces would prefer he not do. Oh, and he's best friends with the producer, with whom he's in love. It's a bit "Broadcast News" in the romantic triangle, but the show has intelligence and suspense all its own. Prior episodes are available On Demand, and you must stop everything and go watch them now. The paper will be here when you get back. (7 p.m., BBC America)

Constitutional lawyer and Salon.com commentator Glenn Greenwald did a comprehensive study of the effects of decriminalization in Portugal earlier this year, and found that the drug abuse situation for most previously illicit drugs, including overdose deaths and disease transmission, had improved significantly, compared with the predecriminalization period and compared with other EU countries.

Hey, Tony: It's easy to blame Shurmur for the ridiculous decision to put McCoy back in the game against Pittsburgh Thursday night, especially since we have so much experience at Heinz Field with players getting really bad concussions and all--and Harrison's hit on McCoy was the most brutal of them all. And I agree with you that you have Seneca Wallace on the roster for precisely those situations.

Also, it doesn't depend on language, so it can spread from one country to another. The 'rules' are very simple, so easy to understand, and yet the puzzle can be surprisingly 'deep.' "

Mindfulness teachers give each beginner a single raisin. The student holds it near his or her lips but doesn't eat it. He gazes at it. He holds it to his ear and squeezes to hear its sound.

If a raisin can arouse all these sensations, so can all other external things. This awareness is the lesson.

Gray is a standout in the crowded field of ambitious young writers with edgy tastes. Her studies were away from publishing-centric New York — she got her undergraduate degree in English literature at Arizona State University and an MFA from Texas State University — which has given her room to develop a unique voice.

He has now missed 3½ times as many seasons as he's played, and hasn't been in a game since October 2009 . . . If there is an unluckier man in the NBA, it is hard to imagine whom."
