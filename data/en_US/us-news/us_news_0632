The small, historic seaport town of St. Marys doesn't have a long history with Mardi Gras, but that doesn't keep the townsfolk from throwing a spirited party each year. This year marks the 18th Annual Mardi Gras Festival and Parade in St. Marys. It's a family-oriented event along the waterfront area of downtown -- a National Historic District. The parade will feature floats and costumes centered around this year's festival theme, "All That Jazz." Jazz acts perform all day long at the waterfront music stage. A highlight of the event is the costumed pet parade after the regular parade, as well as the street festival between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. with kid-favorite amusements such as an inflatable slide, a climbing wall and a trackless train. There also will be numerous arts and crafts displays and a chili cook-off. Make a weekend of it by taking the ferry from the St. Marys waterfront to Cumberland Island National Seashore. St. Marys is the gateway point to Georgia's largest barrier island, where you can see wild horses frolicking along miles of undeveloped coastline. For assistance planning your trip to St. Marys, contact the St. Marys Convention and Visitors Bureau at 912-882-4000, or through its website at www.stmaryswelcome.com.

Free Press sports writer Ryan Ford breaks down three national story lines to follow in this year's tourney:
Santorum, who has gained momentum relatively late in the campaign, was unable to field a full slate of delegates in Maryland — he has faced similar problems in other states — and he does not have any easily recognizable party leaders on his team. Santorum spoke Tuesday night in Gettysburg, Pa., 10 miles from Maryland's border, but his schedule does not include any Maryland events this week.
I'll post more as I learn it.
The Plain Dealer did a back-of-the-envelope calculation to find out. The answer is in Santorum's favor.

Given our own budget problems, Colorado legislators ought not be throwing money at extravagant gestures to manipulate eco-behavior through automobile purchases. The feds have been throwing plenty enough at bad bargains like Solyndra. To put Colorado's tax credit in perspective, consider that this year's state budget (excluding federal funding) is $16 billion. The federal budget is $3.8 trillion — that's $3,800 billion. So the feds spend about 238 times what Colorado does. To match the feds proportionally, Colorado's Chevy Volt tax credit would be $31.50 ($7,500 divided by 238). Conversely, Colorado's credit of $6,000 is the equivalent of a federal credit of more than $1.4 million ($6,000 multiplied by 238). If they offered that much, I'd buy 10.
Robinson also wants the county to team with groups seeking to create a center to connect immigrants with services in the area.

Hey, Rory: Obviously, the NFL trend is more multiple-receiver formations, but I don't necessarily see more shotgun spread offense like in the college game. Pro coaches want their quarterbacks to throw from the pocket. All the NFL rules favor the passing game, though, so variations of the passing game are going to be exploited by the good coaches until defenses can catch up. Ultimately, the trend will revert to the running game. All these trends are cyclical.
Kronos has been a major driver of new music, with over 750 works composed or arranged for it, including everything on Wednesday’s program.

"He's been here for a decent amount of games and even he knows that now, and he's showing that confidence on the ice. For me, to see him do well on Thursday, it's great to see. And it pushes you to come back and make a difference, as well. I think that kind of competition is really healthy."

For 80 years, maybe more, ever since there were gangs in South L.A., there have been gang interventionists -- missionaries, civil rights activists, mediators, mentors.

Though more than 15 million foreigners visit Paris annually—it is the most visited city in the world—Paris Syndrome is not exactly a pandemic. But it is the extreme end of a spectrum of disappointment to which all visitors to Paris will feel susceptible, if they linger long enough. With "Paris, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down," one such lingering visitor, the American novelist Rosecrans Baldwin, has written a sharp-eyed account of his own 18-month sojourn in the City of Light. More than anything, it is a portrait of his growing disillusionment with the place that since childhood had seemed to him "an umbrella, a dream I carried around in case the weather turned bad."

"Marley" is a highly effective PBS-style documentary about reggae king Bob Marley. Music lovers know "No Woman No Cry," "Three Little Birds," "One Love" and other Marley songs. But how many know that he was born to a 60-year-old white English military officer/plantation supervisor and an 18-year-old black Jamaican woman? That Marley was ostracized as a youth for being mixed-race? That he started out in a group trying to be like the Temptations? Or that he was a fanatical fitness nut and soccer player? Director Kevin MacDonald ("The Last King of Scotland") tells the story of Robert Nesta Marley from his birth in a hut in Nine Mile in St. Ann Parish, Jamaica, to his death from cancer in Miami in 1981 at age 36. Ziggy Marley, his oldest son, and Chris Blackwell, head of Island Records, are among those interviewed. Others include Marley's mother, wife, girlfriend, oldest daughter (he fathered 11 children with eight different women) and musical associates, including Jimmy Cliff and Bunny Livingston, the colorful and articulate former Marley cohort in the Wailers. Marley's music pulsates throughout the movie, which is nearly 2 1/2 hours, but never feels long. -JON BREAM

The DEP’s water team has been meeting weekly to assess water supplies, demand, climate data, and weather forecasts. Recent rain and cooler weather have reduced wildfire threats, but the New Jersey Forest Fire Service cautions that risks can rise quickly after just a few days of dry and windy weather. The recent rainfall also cut into statewide precipitation deficits. From a longer term precipitation standpoint, however, New Jersey is considered severely dry. Deficits range from 3.2 inches below normal in Cape May County to 5.8 inches below normal in Morris County. As a result, streams and rivers, critical for replenishing reservoirs, are rated as severely to extremely dry. Shallow unconfined aquifers across the state are also rated as severely to extremely dry. Many private well owners and some municipal water supplies utilize these shallow groundwater supplies. Groundwater is important for replenishing streams, rivers and lakes.

Oh, and please spare us lectures about the federal deficit, all you born-again fiscal conservatives. There are two widely accepted economic principals in question here.

I just need to ditch the happy hours of the old days. Typical outings were little more than an hour at a restaurant, but each of us spent at least $30.

To get the most up-to-date glimpse of art in Orlando, you can always go to downtown Orlando's monthly Third Thursday event, 6-9 p.m. I usually park at the library garage (enter on Central or Pine), and start the night next-door at the Gallery at Avalon Island. GaAI will host a reception for "Amalgamation," a dual exhibition by mixed-media painter Robin Maria Pedrero and sculptor Aurora Rincon. I have watched both of these artists evolve and grow during the last decade, and I think you'll agree that their work has rightfully earned international recognition and awards. Head west on Pine Street to the CityArts Factory (at Orange Avenue) where you can see work by many artists in CAF's six galleries. Ask the folks at CityArts about other nearby venues (including Club 57 West or Blank Space) and they'll point the way and/or give you a free map. This is always a great night out downtown.

As delicate and delightful a morsel as the celebrated Parisian patisserie itself, the new "Sucré" cookbook by famed Ladurée pastry chef Philippe Andrieu is a must for any Francophile or baking fanatic. Encased in the same kind of box used in its boutiques and wrapped in lavender tissue, this tiny book measures just 6 by 7 inches. Its cover is a soft, velvety celadon (like the outer skin of an almond), and the edges of the pages are lined in gold. Within its 391 petite pages are the secrets to perfect pastries - starting with the famed macarons and ending with a Coulis de Passion (passion fruit coulis). It's in French (what bonne chance we have Internet translation sites) and Andrieu's notes at the end of each recipe are especially enchanting. After one of the macaron descriptions, for example, he explains that a variety of factors can cause the cookie tops to crackle, but "Ne vous decouragez pas!"

Jimenez suffered an injury in spring training. Some believe he didn't do enough work in the off-season.

Many visitors like to get away from the train station as soon as possible and out toward the temples to the north and east. But I suggest visitors linger. This helps set up the juxtaposition from new to old that makes Kyoto so special. Stay the night at Granvia, a sleek boutique hotel that feels transplanted from New York. Rooms are large (and come with a discount if you have a Japan Rail Pass). They look out at the bullet trains -- called shinkansen -- coming and going below. Visit the malls and eat in a subterranean restaurant. Some visitors will stay the entire trip to Kyoto at the Granvia because they can get so much more hotel room for their yen than if they stay in traditional ryokan guesthouses in the older districts.

Its center courtyard, filled with greenery, was the private preserve of long-beaked toucan birds that attempted to steal pieces of fruit from our breakfast table every morning.

Stuck in the death spot on "Speak Now" -- three songs from the end of a very long album. Nevertheless, it's a good one: an upbeat rocker that sounds like Tori Amos at her most conventional. Giant bells emerge from trap doors in the stage, and Swift strikes them with mallets as she sings. It's very Nine Inch Nails.

Like the others, the owner had thrown in the towel. It was in tax foreclosure and ready to be forgotten.
It also makes you wonder why college football does not follow the NFL's example, given the success by so many black coaches in the NFL after the implementation of the Rooney Rule that requires a minority candidate be interviewed for each opening. That's how Tomlin earned his job in Pittsburgh. The Steelers gave him an interview as part of the Rooney Rule process. He knocked off their socks and got the offer. Previously, Tomlin had applied for several college jobs but couldn't get an interview.

But members of Shomrim and every other neighborhood patrol in Baltimore should think carefully about what happened on Fallstaff Road in late 2010. We may not be able to know for certain what happened or what was going through the minds of those involved, but there is nonetheless a clear lesson to be learned. Neighborhood watch groups can be the eyes and ears of the police, but they are not a substitute for them.

Superstition has shadowed photography since its invention, and no wonder. It lets us see into moments long gone. It can skim off the look of phenomena without intervening in them. So when we dwell on pictures of the 1906 earthquake's horrible aftermath, we cannot help but wonder whether too much focus on images of such a disaster may hasten its inevitable recurrence.

I think what inflames people about opinion articles like this is that it reveals a logical flaw in our social and mental makeup that we can't really understand. Brown essentially argues that society is now rampant with poseurs because of how easy it is to spend a weekend on Wikipedia learning about a geeky topic and declare one’s self a geek.

The hearing featured two hours of testimony from Mike McQueary, the former Penn State graduate assistant who, in 2002, claims to have witnessed Sandusky raping a boy in the football locker room showers.

The way the salary cap is, teams can't really outbid others for players, especially for a player of Wiliams' caliber, who will get max money no matter where he signs, with only New Jersey having any advantage. And this summer, the old sign-and-trade rules are still in effect -- slightly more restrictive ones kick in starting in Year 3 of the CBA -- so it's possible to offer Williams another year if you're willing give the Nets something they want (like the draft pick they traded for Wallace back)

The New Kids on the Block, in addition to its staging requirements, specified 18 dozen "pre-washed bath towels" and four dozen pre-washed black hand towels for stage use.

A plethora of tiny white bulbs awaits me, so that in less than five minutes I am heading for the jumbled pile of suitcases kept in the back of the store.
If you don't have a written plan, this might be an opportunity to make one. Just be sure this turmoil isn't overly skewing your outlook.

The mallard rings, and it's JWoww's boyfriend Tommy, who hung up on her last week when she tried to tell him she had hooked up with Pauly D. She had apologized to him earlier, and now he tells her he heard that she was dancing with Pauly D all night. Turns out that Russ/Ron is a friend of Tommy's and was told to keep an eye on JWoww. He tells her that if she's flirting with anyone, he's done, and hangs up on her again. She calls him back and says she's tired of him threatening to leave her. Snooki -- Snooki! -- talks some sense into him. Snooki's redemptive arc continues with a visit from her cool mom.

The Guardian recognized that "books that emphasize the conflicts in Donne are hardly rarities," but noted that "no biographer has taken more trouble than John Stubbs to put them in a post-Reformation historical context and to examine their causes and their effects. His evocation is at once highly readable -- because it's dashing as well as detailed -- and somber: Although the poems may sometimes be playful, they arose from circumstances that were often frustratingly difficult. By giving these problems due weight, Stubbs manages to make Donne seem recognizable and sympathetic, and also the inhabitant of a world that has long since disappeared."

Stoglin's combination of brazenness, ambition and talent raise intriguing questions about how long the sophomore — who for years wore a headband honoring his idol, former NBA star Allen Iverson — will remain at Maryland and how effectively his prodigious scoring talents can be integrated into a team concept. Over the past 60 years, only one Maryland player — Bob Kessler in 1954-55 — has taken a higher percentage of the team's total shots than Stoglin, who attempted 30.5 percent in the regular season. Stoglin made and took more than twice as many shots as any of his teammates.

Doesn't that take the mystery out of it? I remember girls in our neighborhood writing letters to Davy Jones, then waiting for the mailman each afternoon. Sure enough, one day, an envelope would arrive with a signed photo inside, and the girls would rip it open and scream and then, if I recall correctly, pass out.

Saturday, the threat is in Florida, from Orlando and Tampa down to Miami. Two inches of rain is possible over much of the Sunshine State this weekend. Low pressure dominates the East Coast with 2-4 inches of rain this weekend, but most of that area is in a drought, if you want to look at it with the rain gauge half-full.

As he awaited the results of the MRI, Hardy said that his ankle has improved over the previous two days. Davis also was optimistic that he's not dealing with anything serious.
But the plot never quite comes together in the second act. Motivations appear arbitrary. One character, a cop, behaves as though she wandered in from a sitcom version of the play. These are real problems. And yet I found I was willing to overlook them all, thanks to Wegrzyn's "bring it" sensibility and the furiously spirited performances of Fitzgerald and Davis.
With too much to absorb in a single visit, I drifted among the more visually striking and thought-provoking displays, scanning as much of the accompanying text as time - and psychological comfort - would allow.

There are many who have concerns about vaccines. Some of these, such as the autism link, have been disproven, but the jury is still out on others. I found no firm evidence that any of these concerns have yet been proven scientifically. I understood that there are risks with vaccines. However, I also understood that there are risks without the vaccines and, in my judgment, those risks were greater.

A couple of curious personal foul calls for hits to the quarterback, one on Carter and one on Washington's London Fletcher, highlighted a pair of field goal drives that left the score tied at 20 at the half. The whistle on Fletcher appeared particularly egregious; the refereed announced that Fletcher hit a late-sliding Brady with a forearm to the head, but Fletcher's arm clearly hit the quarterback in the chest.

Supporters argue that COPA wouldn't conflict with federal law because it wouldn't prevent enforcement efforts. Rather, they say, it is simply a request that the Obama administration stick to the priorities it announced last year.

30, Part II: It's been three decades -- yes, a whopping 30 years -- since Lugar won an election with less than 67 percent of the vote. It's been 12 years since he even had a Democratic opponent. So campaign rust could be an issue, as evidenced by the Lugar campaign's clumsy handling of questions about his residency. But Lugar has taken this campaign seriously since watching several other Senate moderates lose primary and caucus elections in 2010. And remember, all those years of easy re-elections are a sign of the deep affection many Hoosiers have for the senator.

Republicans have so far quashed my bill, shutting it away in the Committee on Redistricting and Elections without even letting it have a hearing. I sent a request for a hearing on the bill to the committee chairman, Rep. Pete Lund, R-Shelby Township, who, along with House Speaker Jase Bolger, R-Marshall, supported a similar measure in 2009 when it passed a Democrat-controlled House. The bill died in the Republican Senate. Now that they control all branches of state government and could easily push through a bill to correct this glaring flaw in our system, Republicans appear to have had a change of heart when it comes to making state government transparent.
