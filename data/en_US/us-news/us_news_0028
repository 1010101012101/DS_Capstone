Meningococcal bacteria, which cause the disease, are transmitted from person to person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions most often through kissing, sneezing and coughing on someone, or sharing food or drink, the University reported.
“It’s just a matter of taking advantage of that conditioning to hopefully do something very good,” Salazar said. “In my mind, the half marathon is a way to test himself in a race that is outside of his normal comfort zone, which is the 5k to 10,000 – to go in there and test himself against literally some of the best in the world at the half marathon distance.”
"The court had already upheld our claim of state equal protection," Goldstein said. "So now our case will be heard on both state and federal constitutional grounds.

Among more modern options, a pitched battle continues between the two "rabbit"-style openers, both widely available: Le Creuset's Screwpull ($100 for the gift set) and Metrokane's Rabbit ($36 and up). Both are effective, though I've found the Screwpull easier to use of late. Either is a far better option than those infernal winged contraptions.
But when Clark, 65, founded the Anoka County Chapter 470 Vietnam Veterans of America Honor Guard 14 years ago, he did so not only to pay final respects to fellow veterans. He did it, in part, to reconnect with veterans who could share war stories that only they could understand.

Rob Rang, senior draft analyst for NFLDraftScout.com, said he didn't pay much attention to Thomas last season because he didn't expect him to enter the draft. But his early impression of Thomas led him to project him to be a sixth- or seventh-rounder, and possibly an undrafted rookie free agent.
While I have not been enamored with President Obama’s performance, the Republican presidential primaries have reaffirmed that he is a superior alternative to any of the Republican candidates. Gingrich, Santorum, Romney and Paul would, no doubt, see my position on expanding the safety net in the short run, to assist those who are unable to find work because of the economic downturn, and my call for reducing income inequality, as evidence that I favor turning America into a “European-style welfare state ... that would poison the very spirit of America,” as Mitt Romney has said about Obama’s efforts.

Here's what should have happened: When you returned your vehicle, a National employee should have walked around the car with you, noting any damage. If you spotted a fender-bender, you could have begun the claims process immediately. Contacting you weeks later doesn't make National's claim any more credible. Offering to let it go - and then making a U-turn - makes it lose all credibility, in my opinion.

Western trade with China had been well established by the 17th century. At the time, four port cities did trade with the west. In 1757, however, Emperor Qianlong limited western trade to one neighborhood only of the port city of Canton. Thirteen hongs refers to this area of western businesses. These were not necessarily the factories where goods were produced; they were the business centers of countries trading with China. The flags on the bowl are the flags of Denmark, Spain, the United States, Sweden, Britain and the Netherlands, all of whom had export agreements with China.
Marcum (5-1) wasn't about to let that happen on his watch. The right-hander allowed a run and five hits over seven innings and struck out four. It helped that he faced a lineup with four position players who came in batting .230 or lower -- including Uribe and James Loney. On top of that, sluggers Andre Ethier and Matt Kemp both were 0 for 4.

Fat chance for a show that's so desperate to prevent viewers from clicking away that it fires a blitzkrieg of name-brand talent in the first 20 minutes, parachuting Green Day into a lineup of musical acts that went by like some kind of "Saturday Night Live" parody. "Glee" ratings magnets Lea Michele and Matthew Morrison were held back, presumably as a way of keeping the younger set from diving irretrievably down the social media rabbit hole, though I can't image Michele's overwrought "Funny Girl" number has Barbra Streisand crying into her scrapbook.

Senator Miller says he hopes the committee can act quickly enough to introduce legislation to be acted on this year. The effort was not made in concert with the House of Delegates — which has its own problem to deal with in the person of Del.

Format: There is only one way to top an album with a seventeen-minute centerpiece, and that’s to release two and a quarter hours of music, all at once, spread over three disks. “Have One On Me” is a mini boxed-set: open up the case, and you’ll find a lyric booklet, and sleeves marked one, two, and three. Each is decorated with a cute photo of Joanna Newsom in a short dress and pointy shoes, putting up her hair; she is not above fanservice. Ever meticulous, Newsom has divided the collection evenly: six songs per disc. In a concession to the iPod age, some of the advance hype suggested that “Have One On Me” was really three separate albums released all at once, and you weren’t expected to sit there and listen to the artist scraping her harp for one hundred and thirty minutes straight, not really -- I mean, it’s a fast-paced world, and there are season premieres to catch that can’t be Tivoed. If you jump around, an out-for-vengeance Joanna Newsom isn’t going to burst through your front door with a flaming sword, but it is pretty clear to this first time caller and long-time listener that she means for you to experience “Have One On Me” as a complete statement. She’s an album artist; she never would have ended a set with a track that begs for the kind of resolution that “Occident” -- the HOOM disc 2 closer -- does. Consider also that ideas developed in the very first song on HOOM1 are brought to a satisfying conclusion on the last song of HOOM3, and that that last song on HOOM3 is a reprise of the epic track in the middle of HOOM2. (And yes, I do enjoy referring to this massive, sometimes-overwhelming set as HOOM; it sounds like a supercomputer crossed with a loom crossed with a vacuum cleaner, which, come to think of it, isn’t a halfway-bad description of Newsom’s brain.) If you made it through “69 Love Songs” or, for you Jersey emo types, “The Mother, The Mechanic, And The Path,” “Have One On Me” ought to be no sweat. I do recognize that attention spans are shortening by the hour, and that those who would once have gladly listened to “Tales From Topographic Oceans” in a trance are now busy channel-surfing and text-messaging and voting for the latest American Idol. You might conclude that anybody who’d actually bother to absorb “Have One On Me” in one sitting is either 1.) a technophobe who cannot get with the earth-shattering, synapse-scrambling, aphasia-precipitating possibilities of the new technologies, 2.) some kind of crazy, or 3.) hopelessly in love with Joanna Newsom. I could be any one of those things, or several of them; I’ll let you decide at the end of the review. But even if I am, that does not preclude the possibility that the full megadose of HOOM is good tonic for your soul. If it is, I mean; I haven’t begun to render judgment here. An epic album deserves an epic write-up, and if the artist can go long, this cagy interlocutor can, too.
Good observation. But are you telling me Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger don't look alike?
Then she took a deep breath and said, "My name is Teresa. And I am an atheist." As the room exploded with cheers, Teresa MacBain wiped away tears.
A penalty was assessed on Harrison, giving the Browns a first-and-10 on the Steelers' 19. Backup Seneca Wallace replaced McCoy, who returned two plays later with the Browns at the Pittsburgh 5, and facing a first down play after Wallace had connected with Evan Moore for a 13-yard completion.
This is bad policy generated by people not attuned to the full consequences of their actions. Or it's a worse situation, and they're willingly orchestrating this result.
“He is a collaborative leader for us who helped define problems and start the process toward coming to a solution.”
"Kinect Star Wars" is proudly in the former category, and the faithful should run screaming like it's a "Star Wars Holiday Special" sequel. At least that notoriously cheesy 1978 TV program wasn't interactive. "Kinect Star Wars" has a dancing mini-game that is bad bordering on surreal, replacing modern pop standards with "Star Wars"-themed lyrics as characters including Han Solo perform ridiculous dance moves.

He was in a similar position last year, when he came into Darlington ranked 29th. The Darlington victory was hoped to be enough to get him moving, but he had only three top-10s after.
"My point is we all trusted each other with that same equal deal," Theriot said. "That's kind of how I approach it. You want to have that trust in your teammates.

Aftab said parents should talk to their children about being involved in cyber-bullying, either as the victim or instigator, and take steps to address the matter. For instance, parents should be watchful to see if a child's behavior or attitude about social media and technology, such as text messaging, has changed, which could be an indication they have been harassed, she said.

Hernandez responded by striking out Kipnis and Shin-Soo Choo. Hernandez hopped off the mound, yelled, and slapped his glove after his 126th pitch.
The hardest one to handicap. All five women were wonderful. Cruz, who has picked up a few awards already for playing Javier Bardem's crazed ex, appears to be the favorite, but she's been much better in other films (the recent "Elegy" for example). Tomei, who won this award 17 years ago for "My Cousin Vinny," will get votes for screen bravery. She has been mostly naked in her last two films.
There's a lot of talk right now about values-driven design and what it can do to make the world a better place. Most of those conversations center on the green building trend; architects are leading the eco-revolution, creating smart homes and advanced public spaces that are energy-efficient and Earth-friendly.
One is to encourage your child to graduate a semester or two early. Taking as many Advanced Placement courses as possible in high school, and perhaps a community college class or two in the summer, could give a student a full year's worth of college credit.
Santore’s office is cluttered with the raw materials of his trade. A plastic mortar tube is in a corner.
"Celebrities can attract a lot of attention, and some people take the comments of celebrities quite seriously," says Todd Boyd, a professor of popular culture at the University of Southern California.

Oliver Purnell: We know that DePaul entered the game as the worst defense in the Big East, but the fact that the Blue Demons continually went with their press defense was baffling. Fuquan Edwin is good offensively, but is near-impossible to stop in transition. Press causes transition and Seton Hall's bread-and-butter is transition.
He is the second high-profile athlete to die from cardiac arrest recently, after Italian soccer player Piermario Morosini collapsed on the field during a Serie B game for Livorno last month.

Like many states, New Jersey is rethinking its strategy on Medicaid at a time when federal revenues are down and program costs are skyrocketing. Christie at first proposed — then withdrew — a plan that would have dramatically restricted the future enrollment of poor families. Ultimately, the waiver Christie submitted in September sought as much as $200 million in savings by asking for more aid from the federal government.

Is it too much to expect our city council to listen to the people?
Driving up to the stately historic campus of the King Gillette Ranch, tucked into a 500-acre state park, you'd never know this is where NBC's biggest reality show is made. But it is kind of fitting that the onetime home of a razor magnate would house another powerful global brand.
The 76ers will face Boston, which beat Atlanta in six games, in the conference semifinals.
“We hadn’t gotten out of the first round in three years, so it becomes important because we were used to (playoff success). It’s also important because there are new players here who have to believe and experience it.”

"Ownership is not essential to a project," PSU President Wim Wiewel said in a recent statement, issued through a spokesman. "It's the costs over the life cycle of the project. And we're in the middle of exploring options with the city of Portland."
Postseason success is what the Bobcats hope to consistently achieve with Christian. The investment in basketball also reflects the initiatives put in place last year by MAC commissioner John Steinbrecher -- a program that offers bonuses to schools who elevate the league's profile.

Grader said the biggest danger now is when herring season begins Sunday in the bay. Any oil sitting on the bottom of the bay could get on the nets and foul the fish, so he is asking Fish and Game officials to conduct more testing in herring fishery areas.
Some things have changed, of course. Gone are stables for guests' horses; the school, movie theater, billiard room and bowling alley that were once downstairs; and fox hunts that were staged in nearby barren hills. There have also been financial ups and downs. The Great Depression forced the hotel to close in 1933 and reopen 10 months later under the ownership of Bank of America before being sold again later, according to Anderson's book. The hotel was bought by the Brunei Investment Agency in 1987 and is now part of the agency's Dorchester Collection of luxury hotel properties.

EDISON — Authorities have identified the man who killed himself after allegedly attempting to rob a bank in Edison Wednesday.
The next New York area rapper to make himself a major player: All the buzz surrounded A$AP Rocky, who has been burning up the Internet with a laid-back, menacing delivery that owes as much to Texas hip-hop as it does to rap from his native Harlem. He backed up the hype at the MTV Woodie Awards with a strong performance that featured a guest appearance by Schoolboy Q, another net-rap favorite. But although no real hip-hop fan wants to hear this, Rocky's performance had very little on the the delirious turn by pop-rap combo Chiddy Bang. Newark-raised emcee Chidera "Chiddy" Anamege might swerve around weighty topics, but he's witty even when he's being silly, and his flow is quite a bit tighter than has been reported by hardcore purists. That's especially true in concert. Last spring, he had the kids at Bamboozle going crazy; it's good to see that his magic works in the Lone Star State, too.
Going global will be one of several key topics at the Pure Michigan Governors Conference on Tourism 2012, Monday and Tuesday in Grand Rapids.
He warned that anything less would undermine the solvency of the government, roil financial markets and potentially "plunge the world economy back into a recession." Yet when pressed on how the stalemate with House Speaker John Boehner would end, Obama said: "I think he's absolutely right that it's not going to happen without some spending cuts."
There will also be a moment of silence at Saturday afternoon's Homecoming football game at Rutgers Stadium, school officials said.
The one tease we have of the new electric Rav4 is the badge on the door near the rocker panel (above). Later this year, Toyota will begin production of the jointly developed EV at its Woodstock plant in Ontario, where the current Rav4 is built.
Other theaters indulge in midnight mayhem, but the time-warped Tivoli has been doing it since the heyday of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show." Although the Tiv presents pictures from the baby boomer era ("Back to the Future" screens on two weekends in June), the new star of the midnight movie series is "The Room," a recent romantic misfire that has been rebranded as an audience-participation comedy.
That will not be easy. Suu Kyi, 66, will have almost no power in the ruling-party dominated parliament since her party will occupy only the few dozen seats it won in an April 1 by-election. But she will have an official voice in government for the first time, and the chance — however faint — to challenge and influence public policy from within.
This change was a long time coming. For decades, the Times has been reaching north and east from St. Petersburg. Nearly 25 years ago, we launched our Tampa edition; on a typical Sunday, it routinely sells more than 100,000 copies. By a wide margin, the Times is Florida's favorite newspaper.
Female dogs follow a pattern similar to human sisters. They play well together when they're little — and they want to kill each other when they grow up. At least for a while.
Curry, whose voice was heard in the TV movie "Take Me Home: The John Denver Story," has performed Denver's music in sold-out shows throughout the country, and will refresh the audience's memory of Denver's many hits, including "Rocky Mountain High" "Sunshine" "Calypso" and "Annie's Song."
The FBI has long targeted the mosque. In 2002, the agency worked with an informant who tape-recorded conversations that eventually led to convictions of six Muslims on charges including conspiring to levy war against the United States and money-laundering. The defendants had attended the mosque as well as another mosque in Beaverton.

His statement "Where is the extra money supposed to come from" if the income tax rate was 9 percent in 1990 and the same today does not hold water. The 1990 personal income tax due was $1.8 billion, it peaked in 2007 at $5.6 billion and was $5.0 billion in 2010. The money, about $3 billion, came from increased personal income tax.
With the number of flights into Detroit every day from Asia, and all the technical centers the auto industry has here, theres a ton of international business travel  and that should create leisure travel opportunities here, but weve never had good numbers on that, said George Zimmermann, vice president of Travel Michigan.
After Brian McConnell finally finished redesigning his backyard in Twin Peaks, he didn't want the standard barbecue setup. "I wanted to have a grill that looked like part of the garden and that was not immediately recognizable as a grill," McConnell, an entrepreneur, said.

The limit — now at $166,000 — was not raised for 10 years, and it hampered BOCES’ recruitment efforts, said Robert Lowry, deputy director of the New York State Council of School Superintendents. He said of the 37 BOCES, more than 10 have had vacancies at the same time, and the Western Suffolk County BOCES has had no superintendent for several years. “They basically gave up on trying to find someone,” Lowry said.
The day before Thanksgiving in 1992, the doors opened on a concrete-block building that looked like a convenience mart. Eight TVs. Eight employees. Two thousand square feet, 75 seats.
The tiny mesh tubes can restore blood flow and save the life of someone undergoing a heart attack or improve the quality of life for someone with symptoms of clogged arteries, such as shortness of breath. But they can also lead to blood clots and other dangerous complications in recipients.

2010 Starmont Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($18, 13.9%): This offshoot of Merryvale reaches up and down the length of the valley for fruit to balance out the flavors in this larger-production bottling. Fermented in a mix of mostly older oak and steel, it comes out a touch edgy and tart. But the cat's-business scents are a shout-out to New Zealand fans, backed up by pretty snap pea and tart peach. Zesty and fulfilling.

My father-in-law, Sam, also loved the kitchen.

There is no reason that the U.S. shouldn't be energy independent in 10 years. Yes, we would have to drill some more, but as Peter Morici points out ("Obama's bad bet," April 3), we would manage the environmental issues much better than others.

Shooting in San Francisco and Ann Arbor, cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (who's worked with Pedro Almodovar) lends "The Five-Year Engagement" a lovely sheen, far easier on the eye than any previous Judd Apatow-produced comedy. The narrative formulas aren't exactly new; they wouldn't be formulas if they were. But one scene in particular seals our investment in the story. It's a late-night argument, following a dicey encounter between Violet and her mentor, and the way Blunt and Segel build the scene, it feels utterly true (without sacrificing the funny). Segel and Blunt are enormously likable people on screen, armed with wide-eyed charm and stealthy timing. When the relationship at the movie's heart threatens to erode from within, you feel for both halves equally. And by the end, you realize how seldom this happens in this most devalued of genres.

Certainly, the young man youre talking about is a productive member of that team. He was averaging about 20-21 minutes a game. We will talk about his role, we will talk about the impact of his not being available to the team as they go into the postseason.

The Portland Jazz Festival, strapped for cash after losing its title sponsor in April, plans to stop operating as of Sept. 15. Barring a "miracle" infusion of about $100,000, the February 2009 festival -- previously slated to be the exclusive 70th anniversary celebration for seminal jazz label Blue Note -- won't happen.

First, and perhaps foremost, is the timing of the hospital's accusations that I implanted stents in patients who did not need them. These charges, which originated from someone within the hospital community, conveniently surfaced as St. Joseph Medical Center and its Denver-based owner Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) was entangled in a federal investigation of misconduct between them and MidAtlantic Cardiovascular Associates. As my troubles became front-page news, St. Joseph Medical Center moved to the back page.

On the surface, "Through," a premiere, might seem to be of the same order as "Swipe." Cong is the resident choreographer of the Tulsa Ballet and, like Caniparoli, a hybridizer, taking from various idioms to forge a contemporary ballet. But Cong, with a pastiche of music compositions by Ryuichi Sakamoto that became increasingly schmaltzy, and despite obvious talent, lacks Caniparoli's capacity to layer. He tends toward the sentimental and superficial, like Smuin, but unlike Smuin, the pas de deux are mechanical and virtuosic, not emotive, reducing "Through's" abundant circles, lifts and leaps to pyrotechnics. While the rich action was always moving somewhere, it lacked the depth that makes us feel the human poetry of motion.
The one thing that hasn't changed much is the focus on wine. Many are offered by the half bottle, and during the summer the list includes lots of rose.

The naturalist dug in to his elbow to grab a quahog. His legs were slathered to the hips. My son sank so deep he couldn't move, but how could I grouse? I was up to my knees. We washed off most of the muck before we got back in the canoes, knowing that showers at the put-in would remove the rest.
The debate is more about who would own and build it -- either Moroun (who wants to build a replacement span next to his privately owned Ambassador) or a public consortium of Michigan, Ontario and the U.S. and Canadian federal governments, which hope to hire a contractor to build a new bridge in southwest Detroit near Zug Island. That plan is called the New International Trade Crossing.

Given the apparent popularity among voters of laws such as the Legal Arizona Workers Act, which created employer sanctions for hiring illegal immigrants, and SB 1070, the state's controversial immigration law, why raise these concerns?

League sources told FanHouse that the Bobcats and Portland have discussed a trade that would send beloved small forward Gerald Wallace to the Blazers with center DeSagana Diop and point guard D.J. Augustin in exchange for center Marcus Camby and point guard Andre Miller. And while the Blazers are exploring a litany of their own options and don't appear eager to do the deal as of now, the discussion that is one of many being had by the Bobcats reveals plenty about the sort of the on-court changes Jordan has in mind for his club. Last Friday the Charlotte Observer reported the Bobcats were exploring the trade value of some of their key players. Today it seems Charlotte, 9-18 and 12th in the Eastern Conference, is moving forward in a more serious direction.

Last month the city removed fencing from the Brock property using incorrect practices, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The removal damaged native habitat and the year-round stream that is a tributary for Wilson Creek. Instead of removing the fencing by hand, the city used large machinery that was driven over the stream and ripped out nesting habitats that should have not been touched until after June 15. The city also sprayed the herbicide Crossbow during this nesting season.
As for the game, it was billed as a head-to-head duel against All-Star reserve candidates Aldridge and former Lake Oswego High School star Kevin Love and it lived up to the hype.

_ "Another Earth" (2011): I saw this at Sundance in 2011 and was completely mesmerized by its low-budget, idea-driven premise, which, like the best sci-fi, uses an alternative, near-future reality to provide a unique perspective on who we are now. Mike Cahill's powerful direction of a clever, haunting script by the movie's beautiful, unknown lead, Brit Marling, along with an emotional but restrained performance by William Mapother, make this a deeply resonant film about grief and redemption.

THOMAS: Possibly. Arizona courts have yet to determine what the separate criminal offense must entail. However, the statute is written quite broadly. It also is yet to be determined by the state courts whether merely providing medical care and housing to an elderly person who happens to be without status would meet the state's definition of harboring. In the event that criminal liability is found, the penalty is a class 1 misdemeanor and subjects offenders to fines of at least $1,000. However, a violation that involves 10 or more illegal immigrants is a class 6 felony with a fine of at least $1,000 for each immigrant involved.

We did talk to a dentist who suggested that if you do try an over-the-counter teeth whitener, to make sure you include your dentist in the conversation so you can get proper guidance. There are sensitivity issues with some people and also a dentist can better direct where the whitening agent needs to be applied. Also, the dentist we talked to, Dr. Denton Kimbrough, said people with deep-seated staining of the teeth from years of coffee or cigarettes probably will not be helped by an over-the-counter teeth whitening product.
It's hard to imagine that bad blood has lasted 50 years, but maybe there's something to Sullinger's theory. Since that 1962 game, OSU and Cincinnati have faced each other just once, a 2006 matchup at the John Wooden Tradition in Indiana that OSU likely scheduled more to allow Indianapolis natives Greg Oden and Mike Conley to play back home than to rekindle a long-extinguished rivalry.

It’s also important to be thinking like a designer instead of a player. A lot of the stuff we get is just people basically campaigning to have their player be more powerful. They don’t think about the long-term about how that’s bad for the game. All of the things they want to work on are for their selfish desires as a player. You also have to be a huge consumer of games. Anyone we’ve interview, we ask them what games are you playing now, what are your favorite games of all time and why? What flaws have you found in them?

Ray Ratto, CBSSports.com: "When more money is distributed to fewer schools, as a playoff system would essentially ensure, who benefits from that power surge? The same people who have most of it already. And who will keep that power in check? Who will ensure players get more freedom and a greater chance to pursue whatever academic dreams they might in fact have? Who will be in charge of transfer policies that of late have reminded us just how restrictive and unfair the current system is? That's the stuff we ought to be chasing first. The stuff that matters not to our viewing enjoyment, but to the betterment of the young people who provide it. You see, the BCS isn't the worst thing to come down the pike in the history of college athletics. The NCAA rulebook is worse. So are coaches who run their programs with their own needs in mind rather than the needs and desires of their players. Not to mention the players who leave college no more prepared for an outside world than they were when they got in."

But it may be best known for two accidents — Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 — that killed 14 astronauts and forced the nation to rethink its space exploration goals.
The lengthy delay on launching Discovery is in line with the care that NASA has taken with shuttle repairs since the 2003 Columbia accident. After Columbia broke apart on re-entry, investigators attributed the accident to a piece of insulating foam that damaged one of the wings when it peeled away from the external tank during liftoff.

“We’re not writing him out of Denver’s game yet,” McMillan said. “Until he gets back to Portland and visits with the doctors and those guys take a look at him and see how he feels, we’re not going to make any decisions. (The game) is a couple days away. We’ll see how he feels and what he’s thinking and we’ll decide if it’s best for him to play or sit for a few games. That’s more of a medical call than making that decision now.”

As Porcello said, when someone can come out of the bullpen and throw strikes with at least three pitches, "That's pretty good."
In theory, the effect of cellphones on driver performance should be relatively easy to determine: Compare crash data against phone records of drivers involved in accidents. But phone records are not easily obtained in the United States, forcing researchers in this country to find less direct ways to analyze the danger of cellphone distraction. The issue is further clouded by the fact that auto accidents overall have been decreasing even as cellphones become more common.

Building issues: The Stanley Block has been in and out of Cleveland Housing Court. In late 2010, the city filed two criminal cases against Macron Investment Co., the property owner, related to building code violations. Those cases resulted in $105,000 in fines against Macron -- fines that remain unpaid. On March 6, the city filed a civil lawsuit against Macron, to force the company to clean up or demolish the building. Judge Raymond Pianka gave Macron until today to resolve the biggest issues.
Those boxes are often like mini time capsules of 20th-century American retailing and culture: at one end of the spectrum we have the carved wooden, hand-painted Nativity set and old glass ornaments that have been in the family for generations; other packages contain more "modern" accoutrements, including 1960s Styrofoam angels, silk poinsettias and Melmac serving bowls. The newest cartons are filled with contemporary decorations such as SpongeBob or Rams ornaments and made-in-China light strands which never seem to last more than two or three years.
Contrast that description with what's often said about Allen, beginning with the paragraph in the Journal-Sentinel right below the evaluation of Fleener. The paper quotes a scout saying Allen is "more old-school" and a "full-time tight end." Now that sounds like a Giants tight end to me.

"The King's Speech" is the kind of production that makes you ask: why can't every film be made this way? Rich characters fully drawn. Sterling performances.

This scandal seems to vindicate critics who have said Paterno, who will turn 86 next month, is more a feeble PSU figurehead than a head coach with a tight grip on his program. And now his judgment can be questioned.
Dish still needs the FCC to drop a condition tied to its spectrum that requires handsets to have the ability to communicate with satellites, not just ground-based cell sites. The satellite requirement would add to the size of the devices and cost of the service.

“I watched his cutter in his first start, the command wasn't there and all of a sudden you saw it in Minnesota. It was there in Detroit. All of a sudden you saw him starting to command the baseball better. That's probably just relaxing in the situation. There's a lot of expectations on that young man. There's a lot of players who deal with it here sometimes when you're a first round pick and expected to come in and put up huge numbers and be an ace. Each time that he has (gone) out I've seen his command improve.”

During the session, legislators repeatedly lamented the tough choices they faced in piecing together the budget. At one point, numerous social services were on the chopping block, but in the final week most other cuts — including large reductions in mental-health and substance-abuse-treatment programs — were restored. Some suggest that the prevention program was a more palatable target because of its low profile.
There's obviously an audience for the film, probably a large one. They are content, even eager, to sit in a theater and watch one action figure after another pound and blast each other to death. They require no dialogue, no plot, no characters, no humanity. Have you noticed how cats and dogs will look at a TV screen on which there are things jumping around? It is to that level of the brain's reptilian complex that the film appeals.

Pryce is careful to say that he wants no one to feel sorry for him, which is good because it'd be very difficult to. His days, he tells us, consist of working on his tennis serve and getting his kids to school and surfing the internet and then taking his dog -- yes, his dog -- to daycare. He says that he's still healthy and able to run quickly -- a rare, rare thing for a man who spent more than a decade in the NFL's trenches -- and that he is financially secure. He's a producer, the tagline of the column tells us, and the author of a forthcoming novel.

Today, most health professionals have finally acknowledged that chronic fatigue syndrome is a real and serious illness.

Though most of the dishes are new, they're all in the same rustic Mediterranean mode established by former chef Gary Menes. If anything, they're more generic than Menes' graceful originals were. (Menes left to open Palate Food & Wine in Glendale and now is looking to open his own place.)

It is not possible for any medical practitioner or care provider to exercise the same around-the-clock, moment-to-moment loving surveillance that such a parent offers.

NEWARK — Closing statements were temporarily delayed in the schoolyard murder trial this morning after a Superior Court judge refused a prosecutor's last-minute request to change part of the judge’s instructions to the jury before they deliberate.
Ohio is not alone in its ideological wheel spinning, either. Instead of working to bring relief to homeowners suffering from foreclosure or ease the suffocating burden of unemployment, our federal counterparts have been busy pointing fingers and playing a dangerous game of political chicken with our economy. Of course, the debt ceiling should have been raised, as it has been under the Reagans and Clintons of history, but tying its passage to a cuts-only deal with no plan to boost economic growth or create jobs is unfair and irresponsible. It will place the burden of this austerity on the backs of the poor and middle class -- those who can least afford it and the very people whose spending would drive our recovery forward.

One survivor described the ship's sinking as sounding "like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead, mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and the wholesale breakage of china."
