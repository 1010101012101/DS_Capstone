For the most part.

On one end of the great room is a handsome fieldstone fireplace that matches those in the other cabins -- with one significant difference: Dean's fireplace is low and horizontal, rather than vertical, so it doesn't block lake views.
The blood orange sauce is a tangy, low-fat dressing made with reduced blood orange juice (an Italian product, available at Whole Foods), honey and a sage-infused oil. The combination of the asparagus with blood orange, sage, olives and bread crumbs is delicious and very Italian.

We live in a time when government needs money, but $199,999.68 profit on a 32-cent CD seems excessive. Especially when sharing vast numbers of public documents on CD is far more sensible than creating an expensive blizzard of paper. (Posting public records on the Internet would be better yet.)

The division also benefited from higher licensing revenue of TV shows and the availability of a CW television series on Netflix, but revenue from DVDs and other home entertainment sales fell.
In Class 6, Jefferson City went from the unbeaten No. 1 team in the state to barely hanging on at No. 9 in just two weeks time. That's what a pair of losses and elimination from playoff contention will do. Blue Springs fell from No. 5 to completely out after it also missed out on the playoffs. The biggest beneficiaries of the Jays and Jaguars falls are Blue Springs South (up three to 4th), DeSmet (up two to 6th), Lafayette (up two to 7th) and Rock Bridge (new entry at 8th).

On the revenue side, a Jan. 10 report by the state Office of Budget and Management indicates that for the six months ending Dec. 31, 2011, vs. the six months ending Dec. 31, 2010, tax money flowing into the General Revenue Fund -- Ohio's checking account -- is running $778 million ($67 per Ohioan) ahead of what it was. That's what's known as the "actual."
Hennessy said despite his opposition, he wouldn't veto a ban passed by the council. He and Pepper also said it's conceivable that the council might try to negotiate a revised version with the petition group. Pepper said, for example, he might support a bill allowing a longer phase-in period for businesses. The ballot issue calls for the ban to take effect in June.
Mourdock's success is decisive proof, if any more was needed, that the Republican Party has lurched far to the right of where it once was. Lugar was regularly described in the course of his re-election campaign as a "moderate." But he is not a moderate, and he never has been. He is a conservative who happens to be civil. Lugar earned a lifetime rating of 77 percent from the American Conservative Union. If being more than three-quarters to the right puts you in the "middle" of the political spectrum, it's a very skewed measure.

Pat Forde, Yahoo! Sports: "After a century-plus of pushing, the immovable object has been nudged out of its entrenched position. Now it's time to get that sucker rolling. That's the mindset as college football power brokers descend on south Florida this week for the annual BCS meetings. The beginning of a sea change in the game's postseason is at hand. The monolithic impediment to a playoff – the bowl system and all its apologists and cronies – finally has given ground in recent months. When Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany voiced his own playoff plan in February, it was like a Baptist minister drinking a shot of bourbon and declaring it good. When Delany saw the light, that was the signal that major change was inevitable."

Reilly kept moving, though. His first part in Brian De Palma’s 1989 “Casualties of War” went so well, the director called him back and gave him extra scenes. Reilly had early good roles in “State of Grace” and “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape,” too, and by the mid-’90s his tough coal-miner’s face and tender regular-guy attitude marked him as a character actor to watch. (His real dream, Reilly once confessed, was to be his generation’s Gene Hackman).

Equal rights for all ought to unite African-Americans and gays, not divide them. That is why it's smart that three of the first four video testimonials issued by the umbrella advocacy group Marylanders for Marriage Equality feature prominent African-Americans — former NAACP chairman Julian Bond, Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo and actress Mo'Nique. (Gov. Martin O'Malley, who was not publicly involved in this year's gay marriage effort but has pledged to sponsor the bill next year, is the fourth.) They aim to prick the conscience of African-American church leaders, who are well aware of how the Bible was once used to justify slavery and segregation, by framing the issue as a matter of promoting social justice and strengthening families rather than by overt references to the civil rights movement.
In the video, the interview starts with Miller and Troxell sitting at a table in a small interrogation room at North Brunswick police headquarters. As the minutes pass, Miller inches his chair closer to Troxell, who sat with his back pushed against a wall.

First, as a Southerner by birth and someone who spent my college years and first 11 as a reporter in the Carolinas, my perspective on the Confederate flag may be a little more nuanced -- or overly forgiving? Some people, I do believe, fly the flag for reasons that have more to do with a certain live-and-let-live, anti-authoritarian streak than overt, conscious racism. That said, the flag in its various iterations have taken on a very specific symbolism since the 1960s. Flying it today -- using it as a sign for your business, affixing it to the back of your car, whatever -- sends a very specific message. Something along the lines of, "I may not actually be a racist, but I certainly don't care if you think I am."
Nashir, 35, married with five children, recounts the attacks on the Murle with grim pride. It was revenge, he says, for an earlier Murle attack on the Nuer town of Pieri. Six hundred were killed in that August attack, and up to 200 abducted, according to the U.N.
Because of the record-setting deficit last year, cuts were made to the number of paid child care days available for low- to modest-income working families when a child is ill. Children in these families risk losing the continuity of care, and parents risk losing their employment.
Hey, Benny: I believe players that are voted to the game -- or selected as replacements -- reach their Pro Bowl incentives.
If you run into a three-piece Black Sabbath cover band ... that bills itself as "Black Steppchild," by all means enjoy the show. It's worth every penny of the $3 cover charge. But do not reward their efforts with three shots of top-shelf bourbon. They won't know the difference.

Montero had been expected to take a bulk of the at-bats at the designated hitter spot. It’s unclear whether the Yankees have enough budget flexibility to sign a replacement or if they will rotate veteran players into the spot. Montero’s departure also clears the way for highly regarded prospect Austin Romine to become the catcher of the future.

7. Urban sprawl: As Americans grew more dependent on cars, more American communities were designed with cars, not pedestrians, in mind. "After World War II, spread-out housing communities became much more common," says Reid Ewing, professor of planning at the University of Utah, who studies environment and obesity. Sprawling communities produce heavier people. University of Utah professor Barbara Brown, who studies the link between obesity and neighborhood layout, found that those who live in more-compact, more-walkable neighborhoods weigh a lot less than those who live in sprawling neighborhoods. A 6-foot male in a sprawling area weighs 10 pounds more than one in a dense area, she says, because those in spread-out neighborhoods drive more and walk less.
“That’s why helmets have the shape they do,” Beckmann said. “They’re rounded so when you have two rounded surfaces hit each other, they don’t stick. They kind of glance off like a rock skipping off water.”

While neither man said he blamed President Barack Obama, nearly two-thirds of Americans say they disapprove of the way the president is handling rising gasoline prices, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday. A week ago, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed that energy costs were less of a concern to most Americans than jobs and the budget deficit. But both surveys found that most Americans believe the government can do a lot about rising gas prices.

Despite the costs, Atlanta’s high school restructuring has produced mixed results. Atlanta still trails Georgia as a whole in every measurable academic category, such as the percentage of graduates requiring remedial instruction in college and average SAT scores. The city has a few notable exceptions — magnet programs such as Carver Early College High School, which enroll only high-achieving students, and Grady and North Atlanta high schools — but the overall performance remains dismal.

And he has been put to the test. Counting a new walk-on, only 11 offensive linemen took part in Ohio State's scrimmage Saturday, and that's who has been rotating through at practice, meaning senior starters such as Shugarts, Adams and center Mike Brewster have been working with the third-team offense at times, because there is no third team on the offensive line.

Well, it may be the only Salma Hayek film I've only watched once.

Voter disgust with legislators is such that, with truly competitive districts, Statehouse (and congressional) incumbents would soon be doing what too many of their constituents are having to do: Look for work.

Bousman is best known for "Saw" installments II, III and IV, and although his latest is a decidedly less bloody genre offering, it's still a trap: a torturously dull waiting game of fake shocks, an incessant "something's coming!" soundtrack of chanting and moody orchestral noodling, dreary investigating into cultishness surrounding "11" and repetitive bickering between the brothers on faith, God, the devil and insanity.

The resurrection of Christ continues to be viewed by some as foolishness, or at best wishful thinking. This is especially so for strident materialists, particularly those well known for their vocal denial of God and any notion of eternal life such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, or the late Christopher Hitchens, who I pray passed away only to be met with a pleasant surprise (I don't say this to be flip. Though I disagreed with Hitchens matters of faith, I respected his ability to craft an argument and write outstanding prose.)

The truth is indeed in the numbers: At least $140,000 spent on a fruitless lawsuit and another $4.2 million for new administrative digs, all amid a reported $5.2 million budget deficit; the purchase of new iPads for those board members shameless enough to take them and, according to reliable sources, 14 brand-spanking-new toilets - to replace older but fine working ones - just to coronate the new administrative offices.

The former Fire Chief submitted an application for a new Fire House, and FEMA accepted the application, and awarded U City with a $2.6 million dollar grant to build a new one. So what! I applaud him.

The mayor then attacked Trafis over several pages of his Seven Hills News newspaper in 2009 when Trafis ran for an at-large seat, reasoning that he must have been behind the mayor's anonymous critics. He even published a photo of -- egads! -- the young Trafis at a party with a girl sitting on his lap and a libation in his hand. Oh, the humanity!

He says nothing about an injury, and it doesn't seem like he's hurt, but after that game, he's away from the team for a while to handle a shoulder injury.

Sadly, with Morgan, Danielle and Tania ending up at the bottom, it's Tania, a girl with cute bangs and a cool forearm tattoo, who is told to "pack your tools and go." I honestly saw the most potential in her out of the three. (GP says: Mathew is biased in favor of tattoos.) After the elimination, Danielle thanks her lucky stars, Tania cries, and Morgan pouts.

Hey, D.A.: Through three games, I would rank the rookie draft picks this way: 1. Greg Little, 2. Phil Taylor, 3. Jabaal Sheard, 4. Buster Skrine, 5. Jordan Cameron, 6. Jason Pinkston, 7. Owen Marecic. I believe all will make the final roster. Eric Hagg had knee surgery and could be on injured reserve for the season. Of the undrafted free agents, the ones who have stuck out are James Dockery, Brian Smith, Armond Smith, Chris Matthews. I think the first two could make the final roster.

I think the more realistic trade up would be to get Kidd-Gilchrist or Brad Beal IF the ping pong balls don't go our way. I could also see us trying to trade up to get a swingman (Jeremy Lamb? Harrison Barnes? Perry Jones?) in the late lottery with our second pick."
No. Not at all. It's the leading edge of a very large thing.

Built around the timeless, popular songs that poet Federico García Lorca collected, “Vamos al Tiroteo” (“Let’s go to the shoot-out”) combines a plaintive evocation of Spanish folklore with modern aspirations. The music is exquisite, combining piano and cello will traditional guitar to create a shimmering atmosphere, and the verses have a child-like purity which, in a magical number like “Las Tres Hojas,” can be heart-breaking. Gema Caballero and Manuel Gago are thrilling vocalists.

So give full credit to Louisville for winning the game. Freshman Chane Behanan played like a senior, scoring 15 points and grabbing nine rebounds. Gorgui Dieng was a dominant force inside blocking shots, and his presence inside clearly intimidated both Derrick Nix and Adreian Payne, who looked tentative.
To support his point that the defendant was a willing gang member, McTigue showed a photograph of Alfaro, Gomez and another defendant, Shahid Baskerville. The picture, taken by Godinez in the schoolyard at an earlier date, showed Gomez and Baskerville flashing gang signs, and everyone was smiling.
Despite the latest figures from the secretary of state showing Democrats with a 2.3 million edge over the GOP in registered voters, a Field Poll released in late September had Newsom and Maldonado locked in a near dead heat, with Newsom's once nine-point lead slipping to four points - within the poll's margin of error.

In Union's case, it's neither. The Titans, who moved from Class 3A to 4A this past school year, are No. 8 in the Seattle Times' preseason rankings. Greater St. Helens League coaches consider Union no better than a co-favorite to win the 4A division with Evergreen and Battle Ground.
Caleb Hanie had his best overall game in place of Jay Cutler last week with a limited passing attack. He was 12-for-19 for 115 yards, no TDs or INTs and a 79.9 rating. But the Bears likely will ask him to do more against a talented Seahawks secondary that includes 6-3 rookie Richard Sherman and 6-4 Brandon Browner (19 PDs, 5 INTs). Hanie is expected to make better use of his WRs. Earl Bennett (2 catches, 10 yards), Devin Hester (3-35) and Roy Williams (5-49) have been quiet without Cutler. Marion Barber (2-32) and Kahlil Bell (5-24) combined for 7 catches and 56 yards against the Broncos.

"There were some positives on offense that I didn't realize on Saturday," Flood said. "It was tough to see that.

In her testimony at her Senate confirmation hearings, Justice Elena Kagan pointed to a practical answer to the broccoli hypothetical: A law requiring the consumption of vegetables would be "a dumb law" that Congress would probably never pass. But there is also a legal answer, and Verrilli, with an assist from liberal justices, provided it: Even individuals who lack insurance participate in the commerce of healthcare, for example by receiving emergency room treatment. Requiring people to carry insurance is merely regulating how they pay for a product they will be or already are consuming.

Because the dogs have been overbred, the shelter took in thousands of the dogs in recent years, though. That helped drive up DeKalb's euthanasia rate at the expense of many dogs that, if not for their suspected breed, meet temperament tests to be pets.
“Without my friends,” she says, “I’d be doomed,” an idea that emerges again and again in “Some Assembly Required.” As with “Operating Instructions,” or the faith books, Lamott introduces us to her support system: her family, her church, her spiritual advisers, what Sam calls “our funny families and our friends.” Here, however, she takes it further, opening the book to a range of voices, most notably that of Sam, whom she interviews throughout.

Trees have a financial benefit to a city and this is an investment that should be handled with care. They absorb carbon dioxide and contribute to the public health of a community.

So here's your challenge: Next time you watch a movie, especially one that might be a period piece, see if you can tell whether it's been shot on the back lot or on location. Send me your findings.
In this regard, the business importance of Android makes more sense. Many folks, while impressed with its adoption, have criticized Android for not goosing Google's bottom line. But here's another way to look at it: If Apple had the same dominant market share in smartphones as it does in tablets, how much more would Google have to pay to be the default search provider? It's possible that Android saves Google hundreds of millions of dollars every year, Schachter said.

The withdrawal of Newman/Haas puts the Indy 500 in danger of not having a full 33-car field. The race has had a full field every year since 1947, when it had 30 cars. In 1979 and 1997, the field was expanded to 35 cars for "extenuating circumstances."

In the Bavarian woods, the gray alders sleep like grandfathers under the star-lit sky, dreaming of morning. When the plovers sing on their silver arms and the hoary lady in the purple kerchief hobbles by with her basket of strawberry jam, it's spring now, and their roots have thawed from winter. And the desire to explore the road rumbles in their roots.
"Emotions were a roller coaster this week," Penn State linebacker Nate Stupar said. "It's up-and-down, up-and-down. As soon as you get into practice, everything else just disappears. All of a sudden you're done with practice, the real world hits you every time."

The city keeps aiming a mobile speed camera at Euclid traffic when that out-of-order advisory should be blinking a slow-it-down alert in the morning and afternoon, reports Road Rant agent Linda Melchoir.

"Jeff" is much more structured as the story is advanced by events as opposed to being prodded along by character development. Plus, at a lean 83 minutes the movie stays light and jaunty as it's easy to see how a longer stay could have made the plotline a tad overbearing.
In 2011, Michael Fassbender has appeared in, and gotten excellent notices in, "Jane Eyre," "X-Men: First Class," "A Dangerous Method" and, now, "Shame." Each film, and each role, is different, but Fassbender has impressed critics and audiences in each of them.

A mature frontal cortex stops most of us, by the time we reach adulthood, from chewing out our bosses, running red lights, sleeping with the sexy neighbor next door while our spouse is out of town, or charging a yacht on a $40,000 salary. The frontal cortex is the police officer in our brains, warning us not to do something stupid. In kids like Leonard, the police officer has not yet come on duty.
The story of the boy who runs away to join the circus is an old one, but how about the girl who ran away to join the pro-wrestling tour?
The third item that led to widespread speculation this week was Carlson's scheduled Mass celebration at St. Agatha. Some believed the archbishop would use the celebratory occasion - a remembrance of May 3, 1791, when the Polish Constitution was signed - to announce a peace treaty. He would come to St. Agatha to tell parishioners that the end of the St. Stanislaus wars had come. Roman Catholicism would return to the 130-year-old church, and a former favorite son would come back to oversee its restoration.

Reardon said St. Louis is likely to get a boost from health care reform. Cassidy Turley calculates the reform will add 250,000 area residents to the number of U.S. citizens with health insurance. By using a standard measure of 1.9 square feet of medical space for each insured person, the area will need an additional 475,000 square feet in medical space over the next few years, Reardon said. Much of that growth could occur among the area's big care providers, including SSM Health Care, Mercy and BJC HealthCare, he added.
