You'll find that it gets easier.

In Tokyo on Tuesday, Toyota reported a 39 percent slide in quarterly profit but raised its full-year forecasts for earnings and car sales.

At farmers markets, I've been seeing older scallions with thick white bottoms. Sometimes they're so large they almost resemble leeks. Because they have a more profound onion flavor than the skinny specimens in grocery stores, I thought that creaming the white and light-green parts in the fashion of Thanksgiving's ubiquitous pearl onions would make a nice spring side dish.
“One of the many aspects that distinguishes the Lime Stone Road Townhomes from other townhomes is the quality of construction and materials,” Watson said. “Starting at $249,000, the cost savings is a function of a reduction of size, not a reduction in quality.

The plan to inject up to $100 billion in each of the government-chartered mortgage giants could not only help lower mortgage rates but, some investors are hoping, buoy the overall economy. The plan could help banks feel more open to write new mortgages and to refinance existing mortgages at lower rates, offering a possible lifeline to consumers struggling with increasing payments.
There's also the company's declining stock price, falling revenue because trading volumes are off, and criticism that it hasn't paid attention to expenses. Donohue got paid $6 million last year mostly from bonuses and stock grants even as the share price tumbled 25 percent.
Members of the association can show up any day, with horse in tow, sign in and ride indoors out of the weather. Tucker said the area gets 20 to 28 such visitors a month.

What do you do when you're not designing? I definitely love the theater. I love opera. I love dance, and I try to do as much of that as I can. I saw amazing things this season. Last night, I was at a kabuki dance presentation at a Japan society event. I love things that involve diverse national cultures and heritage. I saw a great New York City Opera performance and "The Enchanted Island" featuring an amazing countertenor (David Daniels). It was an exciting theatrical season and, of course, I'm really looking forward to my next design project the Greenwich Music Festival, which I do every year. This will be my third year. It combines dance, drama and music, and I'll be working on Stravinsky's "A Soldier's Tale."

If no mistrial is declared, the question will eventually have to be decided by another jury, Wieder said.
One of those was Allen Wright, the team's equipment manager, who was with the Chiefs when Peterson took over in 1988.

"I don’t know this job gets easier," Girardi said. "But I think you understand it better. You understand your responsibility to everyone. The front office, the players, and the media. The part that becomes easier for me is, you have a better understanding of who your players are. Even though I played with some of the guys, it’s different when you’re managing them than when you’re playing with them. You don’t worry about as many things when you’re playing with them, compared to when you’re managing. I think I know the players a lot better than I did. Their personalities. And I think that’s helped."

I have an idea on how cities, communities can save money so they don't have to cut the employees, cut the budget. Stop doing these stupid leaf-raking, leaf vacuuming or bulky trash pickups. If the cities stopped doing the leaf-raking, leaf-blowing, leaf mulching, vacuuming, whatever you want to call it, and the bulky trash pickup, they'd probably save 20 to 30 thousand dollars a year. So let's save some money for the city employees.

"The Trollenberg Terror"), starring a pre-"F Troop" Forrest Tucker as a United Nations investigator who encounters some monocular, octopus-like creatures in the Alps.

At one point, the kids went wild over composer Aaron Copland's children's song, "I Bought Me A Cat," with their sing-shouting reverberating in the music hall. ("Duck says, Quack! Quack!")
What I like, and what I think is important in terms of being an actor, is that first and foremost, to bore your audience is like the worst thing you can do. Always try to keep them guessing. Always try to send them something out there that they're not necessarily expecting. And always try to challenge yourself as an actor. The idea that I could have fallen flat on my face in terms of a couple of these characters is the very reason I did it. If you're not prepared to fail miserably, then you're just sort of walking through, aren't you?

It didn't matter. Our Nicoise salad with salmon ($10) brought more coos over perfect fish poaching and the expertly balanced and silky vinaigrette to light up every item on the plate. Chicken salad fans should depart immediately from the norm and try the croissant sandwich version ($8.50) spiked with mango chutney and chevre.

Hocus Pocus and Genuine Risk: In 2005, Los Angeles resident Peter Hunken, a former assistant winemaker for Stolpman and Piedrasassi vineyards in Santa Barbara County, and his wife, sommelier Amy Christine, founded a company they called Black Sheep Finds. Theirs is largely a two-person, underground operation. Their wine is made on the Central Coast, and most of it is sold in California. In fact, Hunken and Christine hand-sell most of it in the L.A. area. The low profile "frees us up to make the wines we want to make," Hunken says.
"Maddie really makes the game flow for us," Young said. "There is so much that she does for us. She can take bad passes and turn them into good sets. She has a great serve, but we know we're going to score the most points when she is our setter out there."

For Roxanne Fleming, the barrier was plain old sexism. After moving to Essex from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 2004, Fleming was turned away from a few hunting clubs on the Eastern Shore because, she said, she was a woman.
But given that Weinstein eventually submitted to that system with "Bully," and given the movie industry's decades-long fear of the government regulation that the voluntary ratings are designed to ward off, that possibility seem miniscule.

Omer Asik missed two free throws that would have given the Bulls a three-point lead in the final seconds. Iguodala grabbed the second miss, sprinted the length of the court, and was fouled by Asik on the driving layup. He made both and 20,362 fans went absolutely wild.
With each concert on the spring's must-see tour, the Boss seems to travel backward in time, recapturing more of the virility and stamina that helped make him famous. His flirting with the crowd gets more pronounced, his cross-stage knee-slides are more exuberant, his joy is more apparent. At Izod Center earlier last week, he chugged a beer mid-set; at the Garden, he chugged two beers, flinging the empty cups into the crowd as he sang. The weary, downtrodden, victimized narrator of so many of the "Wrecking Ball" songs continue to fade away, replaced by the hedonistic, defiant, indefatigable blue-collar hero who strode through his '70s songs.

But if an NBA team is traveling, players might not arrive at their hotel until 2 or 3 a.m. Shootarounds typically start at 10 a.m., for which players have to be present by 9.

Many top free agents want to go where they can win. Or at least where they know what to expect. The Browns don't qualify in either category. They may someday. They don't now, not while their biggest attraction for free agents is Mike Holmgren as club president. They are somewhere in the early stages of yet another Dreaded Rebuilding Plan.

In an article I wrote for The Plain Dealer recently, I praised her for getting the quad 80 percent ready in a short period of time. I wrote of how she, for my money, was the LeBron James and Kobe Bryant of massos. Several readers wrote and called wanting to know more about Karen, and about how they can reach her. I don't want to make it seem like I am promoting her practice; she would not want me to do so, anyway. She does not need clients, and she didn't even know I was going to write about her.
"We want the community to know that we're looking closely at the impact of the economy on the orchestra, and dealing with it prudently," Hanson said.
Sutton said in a prepared statement: "Instead of protecting the top 1 percent on the backs of working families and seniors, we need a balanced approach to creating a budget; one that provides peace of mind instead of uncertainty, one that provides American jobs instead of unnecessary, expensive tax breaks, and one that provides every Ohioan with a fair chance at the American Dream."

Here's what you need to know. First, I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits - either now or in the future. Period. And to prove that I'm serious, there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don't materialize. Part of the reason I faced a trillion dollar deficit when I walked in the door of the White House is because too many initiatives over the last decade were not paid for - from the Iraq War to tax breaks for the wealthy. I will not make that same mistake with health care.

The next hour and a half of driving on "the" road, steep and winding, allowed me that off-the-beaten path feeling I imagined, only better.

I was truly in the moment, digesting all of this scenery, along with the most mouthwatering mild cheese I have ever tasted. Life can't get better than that.

After trials, tribulations and a few unexpected twists, Vasa Lisa emerges triumphant.

Why has not the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District followed suit? When people throwing heavy objects off the south end of the bridge onto Fort Point became a problem, fences were erected, and the problem ceased. The architect of these barriers, Donald MacDonald, has provided only one, albeit the best, solution to the problem that at 4 feet high the handrails practically invite leaping. Surely these handrails - which legend says are so short because bridge impresario Joseph Strauss was hardly more than 5 feet tall and did not wish to be intimidated - could be extended in an aesthetically appropriate manner.

Reasons for pessimism: The Ducks’ offense is built for speed and the offensive line has been the conduit between running backs LaMichael James and Kenjon Barner and the end zone. However, the Ducks have struggled against physical teams, specifically Auburn in the BCS Championship and Ohio State in the 2009 Rose Bowl. The Ducks' line won’t get any bigger with the addition of the 260-pound Arrington and 275-pound Golpashin. It’s reasonable to suspect the Ducks offensive line ultimately will fair just fine. But one has to wonder how this retooled group will perform against LSU on Sept. 3.

I could stop right here and feel satisfied. But this is just the start of a meal at the Royce.

There have been some bipartisan victories on Mr. Obama's watch, but he's often been the partisan loser in such fights. For instance, Congress extended the Bush-era tax cuts, much to Mr. Obama's dismay. And even on more clear-cut bipartisan victories -- say, the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," or the trade deals Mr. Obama delayed unnecessarily -- there's little evidence that Mr. Obama brought any opponents around to his position. The man just isn't very persuasive.

My heart palpitations started. Tunnel vision was setting in. These nice people trusted me with their children and I made them drug addicted, teenage parents and the oldest was only 9. I'm not an adult, they should have seen that. Yes, I'm 36 and have three kids, but I still listen to loud music with lots of swearing. I stay up late thinking up backgrounds and motivation for my Dungeon and Dragon characters. I have arguments with other "adults" about fictional characters fighting one another (Link from The Legend of Zelda would beat Luke Skywalker, but The Incredible Hulk would smash them both flat. Sorry, that's a fact). Now these poor children are going to pay the ultimate price for someone trusting me with their well-being.

Figment stands for the connection between reader and writer, whether professional or peer. Its success, then, simply reaffirms what readers everywhere have always known: that literature and reading aren't going anywhere.

Henry Abbott: Remember when Channing Frye went the better part of a season in Portland without being able to shoot well? It is a terrible thing to be a shooter who misses a lot. Rudy is in that same boat, and would be wise to emulate Chandler, who spent the summer becoming one of the best 3-point shooters in the league. The Blazers need floor-spacers badly, and Fernandez has the inside track on the job. Also, I think the word is out that Fernandez won't do anything (but flop) if you beat him up, and therefore he gets bullied all the time, which has to contribute to those little nagging injuries. (He's certainly not the high-flyer he once was, either out of fear, age or injury.)
We need reality-based leaders and spokespersons that have a serious understanding of the mood of the country at this time. It's embarrassing to hear well-intentioned Latino elected officials who support the DREAM Act beg for mercy in melodramatic telenovela language.
