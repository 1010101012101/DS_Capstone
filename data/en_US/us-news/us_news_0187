Flying into Las Vegas two days before the hike seemed like a good idea, but it didn't give us enough time to get used to the higher elevation. On the second day, we drove through Death Valley, making a quick stop at Badwater, the lowest place in North America at 282 feet below sea level. Then it was off to Lone Pine, the gateway to Mount Whitney, where we would stay before and after our hike.
Organize files into long-term reference and temporary action files (i.e., invitations and bills). Long-term reference files should live in the file cabinet, whereas temporary files should be stored on your desk and categorized into actions, such as "To pay" or "To respond."
I had a lovely dinner with a couple of friends recently. The food was so so, the company was great. When the checks arrived, we started talking about tips. I mentioned that I tip before the tax. My friend replied she tips after the tax because she used to be a waitress and knows they don't make a lot of money. I replied back that I shouldn't feel obligated to give the waiter/waitress more just because they don't make a decent wage. Before you go spitting in my water the next time I'm dinning out, I typically tip 15% to 20% if the service is good.

As always, you concentrate on the few people who are victims of gun crimes without taking into account the large number of people who use firearms successfully for defense. And what about cops who shoot innocent people, including other cops and spouses?

Cremation in Japan was traditionally limited to the wealthy; in the early part of the 20th century, most Japanese were buried. After World War II, cremation became more common, for reasons that had far less to do with religion than efficiency and hygiene. Burials in prewar Japan were labor-intensive, with several community members called upon to perform various parts of the passage. Cremation was seen as cleaner and more efficient. In recent decades, burials became exceedingly rare.
TRENTON — The hole in the state’s pension fund grew again this year, by more than $8 billion, a trend that continues after a decade of skipped payments and increased benefits.
But I'm wandering off topic a bit (maybe it's spring fever), so back to spring. For Dennis, it probably means the beginning of baseball season, since he was the sports editor for 13 years. But he can tell you what it means himself.

Hey, Shaylin: I disagree. Shaq has done a good job of getting other centers in foul trouble to start games, plus he's the team's only legitimate post scoring option. By establishing him in the post early, even if he's not scoring at a high rate, it gets the Cavs into an offensive flow. Frankly, considering the Cavs lead the NBA in first-quarter scoring, I'm not sure why anyone wants to change the starting lineup. Also, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Anderson Varejao play very well together and have for the past six years, so having them with the second unit fits well.
The confirmed lineup of chefs includes Josh Galliano of Monarch, Carl McConnell of Stone Soup Cottage, Anthony Devoti of Five, Cary McDowell of Winslow's Home, Tim Grandinetti of Overlook Farm, Christy Augustin of Le Cordon Bleu, Chuck Friedhoff of Persimmon Woods Golf Club, Nick Miller of Harvest and Steven Caravelli of Araka.

Check your favorite wine lists. Gone are the days when lists had to fall back on the same familiar names. Wine directors love to find new Champagnes to set them apart, and not only will you win some points by researching the less-familiar names on your favorite lists (and probably get a better deal than the high markups on popular labels), you'll also have a great potential buying guide.

Most of our team was freshmen and sophomores, so it was special how we came together for a national championship. I remember playing right away with them thinking we were going to be good. I didn't know we were going to be national champions. As we played in the tournament, we just kept clicking and getting better."
The paper, published online in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, found arsenic in two of 17 infant formulas tested. One sample had an arsenic concentration six times the federal limit for arsenic allowable in bottled water or drinking water. In infants, such a level could be toxic because they consume more per pound of body weight compared to adults.
Deason, 38, resigned from the Canby police force July 17, two weeks after he abruptly ended an interview with FBI agents and was placed on paid leave.

4. Mel Martinez. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Republican freshman with more clout in Washington than this U.S. senator. He's good friends with the president and was recently tapped to lead the Republican National Committee. Put it all together, and Martinez, 60, crept into the Top 5 on this list for the first time this year. Martinez's political future should be interesting to watch. The spotlight will burn brightly in his new extrapartisan post. And there are those who wonder how Martinez's clout in Washington will fare once President Bush leaves office. But for now, there is no doubt that Martinez is influential as a senator and as a fundraiser, rainmaker and faceman for Republicans throughout America.

Guides on the Indiana Historic Society's hotel tour say each of the dome's metal ribs rests on something very much like roller skates, hidden behind panels atop each rotunda column. The mechanism, they say, allows the rotunda to bear the weight of the dome while at the same time permitting the dome to expand and contract at a different rate than the building itself. They're actually two different structures that only give the illusion of being attached.

Apparently that memo didn't reach everyone. Early in the show, the nerve-wracked Moritz worries about his vaguely erotic dreams. "Why am I haunted by the legs of a woman?" he asks. "I sense that some dark part of my destiny may lie between them." While much of the opening night crowd laughed, a tween-age girl two seats from me turned to her father and whispered, "I don't get it." A bit later, following some simulated masturbation at center stage during the song "My Junk," the dad gave up hiding the girl's face in his chest and simply hustled her from the theater. (Thus shielding her from the scene that hints at S&M, the intercourse scene, the gay seduction scene, and so on.)

While prosecutors did not say exactly how much time they believe he should be made to serve, they did say that he does not have to be given the maximum sentence and sentences do not have to be given consecutively. In the court filings, they said they consulted with Clementi's family and the other man who appeared in the webstream that Ravi viewed.

After all, Obamacare allows parents to have their children covered under their own policies through age 26 and Brown was elected on his pledge to repeal Obamacare. Of course, the Massachusetts health care law already allowed parents to provide insurance coverage for their children through age 24, but let’s not let the facts get in the way of a good “gotcha” moment. And, of course, even most Senate Republicans support the extended coverage provision; it’s the individual mandate they hate.

Why is he being challenged? We would ask Hawthorne Assistant City Atty. Kim Smith, but he rejected our request for an interview. And probably with good reason; he ran for judge two years ago, and our meeting then didn't go any better than the rest of his campaign.

It’s important for them to know that not all children wake up in the morning to a full breakfast, school or day camp, some XBox time, karate or baseball practice and a warm bed…and then do it all over again the next day. My children need to absorb the message that by using our collective voices, working with others who care as much as we do and watching out for the most vulnerable we can make a difference, whether it’s for the children of Uganda, the homeless here in the States, or the lonely and impoverished elderly.

In a sea of Italian restaurants, Ombra feels very personal. That's because Young is involved in every aspect. He's the chef and wine buyer and is responsible for the look of the restaurant. The dining room is simple and minimalist — dark wood chairs, white tablecloths, the only ornamentation being vases of flowers and a panel of antique Venetian wallpaper with stylized mermaids on the back wall. When he realized the noise level was too high, he added sound panels, something I wish more restaurateurs would do. It works to mitigate the noise and doesn't cost all that much.

Last week, on the anniversary of his diagnosis, Steven played golf and, this weekend, attended one of my workout classes. They think it's due to Protandim, and it's hard to argue with that.

Donna Gabaccia, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota, said that for many families, name changes are important aspects of the American story.

UO offense vs. Missouri State defense: Kelly had said he looked forward to playing against a true 3-4 defensive front, but considering the Bears have given up an average of 428.5 yards per game, it’ll be tough to know how the Ducks stack up against a quality 3-4. Pay close attention to quarterback Darron Thomas, who had a career game against Nevada with a school-tying record six touchdown passes. Arkansas has a field day against the Missoui State secondary, and if Thomas is on again this week, it could mean big trouble for the Bears.

For the cast album of a stage adaptation of a movie, this one is decidedly unusual. All but two of the 14 songs (not counting reprises) are from the 2007 Irish film (and by its stars, Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová). The mostly lovely songs of love lost or yearned for also eschew standard Broadway overkill in favor of sweet or lively Irish folk motifs with some country and one terrific traditional Czech call-and-response duet, all played and sung by the 13 musician-actor cast members. And there's no sense using the songs to try to follow playwright Enda Walsh's book, adapted from John Carney's screenplay. The perhaps romance of songwriters Guy (Steve Kazee, guitar) and Girl (Cristin Milioti, piano) isn't necessarily reflected in the songs they and his bandmates compose and sing. The original cast album of director John Tiffany's New York Theatre Workshop production, now on Broadway, stands on its own. With the exception of the novelty song "Abandoned in Bandon" (too fast to follow Walsh's comic lyrics), the songs are for the most part delightfully handled by the singer-musicians under Martin Lowe's supervision. The principals are as attractive as you could wish, but it would be even better if Milioti's lovely, flexible voice were featured on more than four songs.

Another point of controversy is the poor ability of the U.S. to track cattle. Six of the eight largest cattle exporters in the world -- including Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Canada -- have mandatory systems to track each animal, record its age and other details.

The experience: Pinot Noir is the specialty here, and samplings are often limited to that variety. Friendliness reigns - we're invited to split the $10 tastings with our companions, which can be a real bargain considering hosts aren't shy about offering "top-offs" or "revisits" for our favorite wines. And when things are quiet in the tasting room, guests might score an informal property tour on one of the winery's custom-built mini-Humvee-style carts that sit in the parking lot.

The specialty of the house is something called "delicious soup with dough flakes." The dish is about as stripped-down as you can get: a simple broth, studded with a few bits of squash and the tiniest clams you can imagine and loaded to the brim with thick dough flakes. The dough flakes are the key to Mapo's soul: Think thick, ragged hunks of hand-torn dough, like a primitive version of bowtie pasta. When noodles first emerged from the sea to walk on legs, they probably looked a lot like this.
