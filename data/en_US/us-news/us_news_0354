Someone has to pay for those player salaries, though judging from this year's lineup, Cubs owner Tom Ricketts is not yet coughing up the elephant dollars for superstars. While no baseball expert - the thought "So Mark Grace isn't here anymore?" popped into mind early in the game - I'll admit, I didn't recognize any of the players' names. Brian LaHair? Darwin Barney? They seemed to radiate a deep, Joe Shlabotnik-type obscurity. Not entirely a bad thing. There was a certain joy, a purity in seeing two teams of complete nonentities ­- the Washington Nationals are not exactly the 1927 Yankees either ­­- battle it out in a hard-fought game. The Cubs won, so maybe it's a building year.
This year's show is a two-day event, with Friday's four-act lineup headlined by singer-songwriter Lee Brice, and Saturday's nine-artist bill featuring Rucker, who has, in the words of Alan Jackson, "Gone Country."

It's all been a remarkable rise for a woman who came to central Oregon in 1997 with little more than two dogs, an aging Toyota and an unfinished master's thesis on her laptop. She says she "literally set up a tent on BLM land" over the summer while she finished her thesis and got established.
"It helps," Harmon said. "But it's not the end."
Another error, this time a wild throw by Cardinals first baseman Allen Craig on a potential double-play ball, led to Altuve's homer off Lohse and the Astros had a 5-2 lead, although the Cardinals rallied in the third to cut the lead to 5-4.

Marchionne, a classical music buff, said he attended a Detroit Symphony Orchestra performance of Handel's "Messiah" in mid-December and was wowed by the quality of the orchestra, the venue's acoustics and a choir that was as good "as any European choir I've heard -- any."
Local government-run media have also reflected the central government's influence. Saturday's Chongqing Times in a front-page headline pledged to "earnestly implement the central government's decision."

The legislators, who win friends and campaign contributions even if bills do not succeed, also benefit. The Mercury News review found repeated donations to legislators from sponsors of unsuccessful bills; in the cases of Fuentes, Ron Calderon and Democratic Assemblywoman Mary Hayashi of Hayward, each of them listed more than $10,000 in contributions from sponsors of failed legislation in the most recent session.
Corah said the numbers on how many people were cited and fined by police and fire inspectors won't be available until July 7, when most people's arsenals of mortars, screaming rockets and fire-gushing pillars have been expended. Fire officials in Portland did seize a trailer full of illegal fireworks, but admit it's a tiny percentage of what went up in smoke Monday night.
Delfino missed 10 games this season with the injury, including the last four of the regular season. In 54 games with 53 starts this season, the seven-year NBA veteran averaged 9.0 points, 3.9 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.5 steals per game.
Don’t get me wrong. I like it here. The weather is fabulous and the sardines are delicious. (The food in harbors is so much better than in deep water.) I’m not stressed out, and I’m taking three breaths a minute, which is healthy for a dolphin.
Her son got a call on Jan. 18 that the car was in impound after being found in East Cleveland Jan. 4. Because it took two weeks to notify the owner, she balked at the $500 tab. Police have to notify the owner immediately via certified mail when a car is found and impounded.

Major Samuel Nicholas — the very first Commandant of the U.S. Marines — greeted hungry guests as they walked into historic City Tavern’s courtyard on a warm, sunny April afternoon.
"I believe that he'll proceed to a single-payer system on health care," said Mr. Morris. "I think Obamacare was just an intermediate step in his mind. If he's re-elected, particularly if there's a Democratic Congress, he will eliminate the private health insurance industry and all insurance will be from the government and it will all be according to one plan. Secondly, I think that he will completely reverse the initiatives of the Bush 43 administration in opening up vast new forms of oil drilling in the U.S. And will eliminate this incredible opportunity we have to dominate the global oil markets and put the terrorists out of business. But thirdly, I think that his big focus will be to make the United States a vassal state to a globalist entity."

He's outside the digital domain. If that seems like a trivial thing, it's an index of DJay's plight. His only shot at success seems to depend on recording equipment owned by Key, a high school friend he encounters in a convenience store. Key, who is played with affecting gravity by Anthony Anderson, has become an audio engineer, and has managed to get a precarious purchase on middle-class life with a home studio (though it's his working wife who financed the venture). His equipment -- primitive mixer, ancient mikes, cassette tape deck -- is sadly inadequate in the shiny new world of optical disks. Yet Key's modest achievements give DJay a needed beacon. In a sequence that's both simplistic and stirring, all the elements come together: DJay finds his authentic voice, Key finds his authority as a producer, and DJay's women are pressed into service as backup singers. It doesn't take a village to record his demo tape, only a house.

The poison has to get into the bloodstream to be deadly, but even handling the frogs for "a minute or so" can cause numbness in the hands and arms, Skinner says. If the poison got in through an open wound you "could be dead within a few minutes."
Mr. Bush landed relatively few verbal blows of consequence — his infamous "voodoo economics" line to describe Mr. Reagan's supply-side philosophy being the exception. In 1980, the party was largely unified, and Rep. John B. Anderson's decision to run as an independent had little effect on the outcome as Jimmy Carter lost badly in November.
A Colorado man who led a multistate car theft ring targeting online sellers was sentenced Thursday in Johnson County to five years and three months in prison.
In second place was Fresh Gourmet's Crispy Onions ($2.99 for 3.5 ounces at Cala Foods). These garlic- and pepper-flavored pieces had a "spicy kick," though a few tasters felt there was "too much pepper." Some thought the onions were also "oily looking" with a "greasy mouthfeel." Three tasters might buy these and two would not.
Hamilton died of a massive head injury five days after the incident.
Wolfe, who grew up in Columbia, said in an interview that he turned to his parents for advice during his bid for the president's job.

We spent a wonderful late afternoon in Little Tokyo, eating traditional ramen noodles and drinking sake al fresco at Joy Mart, one many cafes in the Japanese Village Plaza, then browsing for knick-knacks and Hello Kitty souvenirs. A sweet bun from the Yamazaki Bakery was the perfect walk-off for the evening.
Congressional reaction seemed generally favorable, but cautious.
"We got some key hits up and down the lineup, which is good," McGhee said. "We've been scoring runs. We just haven't been able to stop the opponents from scoring."
The scores can range from 100 to --100. A zero score means equal positive and negative feedback. Then the YouGov researchers isolated those consumers who say they plan to buy a car within the next 12 months.

But that's only about 2.2 percent of our gross domestic product, or our economy's total output. That proportion hasn't changed in 40 years, despite greater and more sophisticated marketing efforts by nonprofits, say researchers at The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University.
Blues Defenseman Barret Jackman said, "It was a pretty amazing feat what the Cardinals did, and we are just trying to say congratulations and have them out to our game."
We light candles on Hanukkah because Hanukkah is about bringing the light of ethical monotheism into the world, about bringing the light of spirituality into a time of deified physicality, epitomized by the pervasive Greek culture of physicality and its worship. Hanukkah is indeed a battle of light and dark, polytheism and monotheism, the physical and the spiritual, the outside culture against the small Jewish nation trying to withstand assimilation and disappearance.
The bigger changes occur in the combat. BioWare has evolved the fighting so that "Mass Effect 3" plays more like a third-person shooter with some role-playing elements. To make the controls feel good, they added flourishes like a dramatic omniblade slash. When it comes to the cover system, that's been drastically improved so players can roll in and out of walls and barricades. It feels more responsive and fluid.

øThe overall results fell short of what the four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected. They had forecast Berkshire would report earnings per Class A share of $2,297.50 on $39.154 billion in revenue.
But if you've ever tried soothing a screaming but well-fed infant, that pacifier starts looking mighty tempting. Forget the guilt, and go right ahead. We've now seen solid proof that it's OK to give a binky to breast-fed babies once you've established a solid nursing routine. That usually takes just two weeks or so (ask your doctor if you're not sure). Using a pacifier between feedings won't upset the supply and demand (your milk and your baby's interest). Yes, it's fine at 4 a.m., too. This all-clear is based on the experiences of 1,302 nursing moms and babies who were followed closely for three to four months. Pacifiers simply didn't lead to early weaning or cause breast-feeding complications.
Seahawk senior Jon Carr, who was responsible for the run-starting score early in the second half, felt the shift in momentum right away.
We are about to find out because the union is supporting a separate trio of board hopefuls this year.

I could go on and on about the restaurant's overemphasis on presentation, but gussied-up gastronomy seems to be a Palm Springs tradition that won't die. Still, the restaurant was doing a bustling business and was booked with festival parties.
Director Joe Carnahan — whose nothing-succeeds-like-excess filmography includes the awful “Smokin’ Aces” — cuts his action sequences together so fast and furiously you can’t see what’s actually happening.

That was then. His party has since engaged in a 30-year flight from the center that reaches its nadir -- at least, let us hope it's the nadir -- in this era of tea party incoherence, faith-based policy, fear mongering and tax pledge tyranny. This era when compromise is both lost art and dirty word and some Americans see other Americans as enemies -- an era in which there is something lonely and foregone about pleading with an angry nation that this is not how it is supposed to be.

Occasionally Nevins gets carried away with cutesy effects � a weird bit where the faces of those talking are briefly seen as black-and-white sketches is particularly annoying � and ignores mothers altogether.

All good things come to an end and, quite frankly, the good stuff for "Desperate" dried up years ago.

"Scripts are written — it's not an improvised show," Rich says. "But Armando hires actors who are really smart and funny, and a lot of them have improvisational comedy experience. Julia herself went from Northwestern to Second City early in her career. So, he and his team write the script. But then he gets them on their feet and has the cast, after they do the written script, improvise. And they keep refining the script — it's like putting it in a spin-wash cycle — as the actors add more and more with the improvisation."

The first is that pre-release gossip is as old as the movies themselves. Go back to 1916 and D.W.

"Our motion today reflects our commitment to ensure that we are maximizing value for our entertainment customers, creditors and other stakeholders."
"Clackamas County has been very, very aggressive about putting urban renewal districts to bed, so the increased values go back on the tax rolls and everybody benefits from one area that has had an intense amount of investment," Peterson said. "The nice part about urban renewal is that it allows growth to pay for growth."
"You're beating a dead horse, and you're not going to make it come alive," Walton said. "You're not going to win this one."

After much debate, we ended up choosing Greens to represent this square even though it's a relative newcomer. Opened in 1979, it's a mere baby when compared with such places as Ghirardelli Chocolate Co., which set down roots here in 1852 and helped to make San Francisco a center of chocolate making. While the manufacturing business moved to San Leandro in the 1960s, the building still houses a chocolate shop and other tourist-oriented attractions.
Jocelyn, who turns 5 in October, has given Tierney a reason to chase his dreams in MMA. After almost two years away from the sport, Tierney took a fight in the World Fighting Federation, a local promotion, in January 2010 and won the middleweight championship belt.

Instead of coming back home and building on the good they did in Nashville, the Wings saw the hard work they put in Sunday, at least in the last 20 minutes, amount to nothing as they lost, 3-2, at Joe Louis Arena. The Predators grabbed a 2-1 lead in the series and regained home-ice advantage.

After a few months honing its live chops around the Ohio University campus as cover band White Heat, Dave DiGregorio (vocals), Matt Gibson (guitar), Ed Planisek (drums), Adam Smith (bass), Ian Roth (keyboards) and Joe Quebodeaux (vocalist) decided to form original rock-meets-hip-hop act iPhonic. "It kind of started when we went into the studio to record some songs that our singer Dave DiGregorio wrote," said Gibson, who just graduated from Ohio with an English degree. "From that we kind of just turned them into hip-hop and alternative-rock songs. It's really hard to pinpoint exactly who we sound like. I know as a guitar player, I've been compared to Eric Clapton and Santana a lot, but as a band we have been compared to the Flobots, the Knux and Asher Roth. There's more pop, alternative spin than what you'd have with Limp Bizkit or Rage Against the Machine." While the sextet has already recorded the six-song EP "Listen Hard," which includes the upbeat "So Soothing" and the aggressive "Why Not Die This Way?," the band plans to return to the studio later this month. You can see iPhonic in action at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Roc Bar, 1220 Old River Road, Cleveland. Also on the bill are Gypsy Relic, Dope Hogan, Hayden Calling and BlowUpDollz. Tickets are $5. Call 216-771-6655.

At the end of Schuller Coleman's speech, a cathedral minister immediately addressed the crowd to say that worship services will continue at the cathedral on Sundays at 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. Tuesday's news release said the services will feature what many long-time congregants say they have been missing since Schuller Coleman took over: "traditional music and message which is synonymous with the Ministries' legacy."
8. Impromptu (1991) Frederic Chopin: If you're looking for a period piece that isn't too period-piecey, filled with operatic drama and stilted dialogue, this story of writer George Sand (Julie Davis) pursuing shy composer Chopin (Grant) is a good choice. Bernadette Peters is excellent as the jealous woman.
His creative rootlessness continues after Pinter: He can be seen in the indie film "Hysteria," about the invention of the vibrator, with Maggie Gyllenhaal, Hugh Dancy and Rupert Everett. And later this summer he'll be playing the U.S. president in the blockbuster sequel "G.I. Joe: Retaliation."

wasabi peas. These are terrible matches for red wine, making it taste harsh and hot. When you're going to a no-real-food party, bring along a rosé, the wine most friendly to snack food out of plastic bags. The 2004 El Coto Rioja Rosé ($9) from Spain is light and fresh, with appealing fruit flavors and floral notes in the aroma. It'll be much better with nacho cheese dip than any big-bodied red wine.

51: Thomas’ career touchdown passes. The figure ranks fifth all-time for a program that has produced 14 NFL quarterbacks, eight in the last 15 years. Thomas’ 30 touchdown tosses in 2010 rank as the second-most ever for a Ducks quarterback. He has 18 this season in seven games. The all-time career record is 62, held by Danny O’Neil. Thomas could still break that record by the end of the season and ultimately could flirt with 90 career touchdown passes by the end of next season. He also could challenge Bill Musgrave in career passing yards (8,343). The notion of benching someone on pace to become the most prolific quarterback in school history is absurd. Thomas has more touchdown passes than Bennett does career pass attempts.
Timbers backup midfielder Adam Moffat, who also played for Columbus in 2010, said there's no excuse for a player unknowingly taking a supplement that contains a banned substance. Moffat said the league has a committee that will answer any questions players have about supplements and the league holds an annual seminar and facilitates classes to educate players about nutritional supplements.

The idea of the story is that our hero, Larry — a longtime sales clerk at a Walmart-style store — is being fired because he doesn’t have a college degree. (Which starts the story off on a false note — isn’t he exactly the sort of loyal, minimum-wage employee that big-box stores depend on?)

"I can say this in all sincerity that this has not been difficult at all," he said. "We have a budget and we adhere to the budget. The ownership part doesn't even reflect on hockey operations. Our players, our coaches, our management, we've just cared about that. If and when that type of thing gets done, that's awesome. But right now, there are no issues. We do what we have to do, and it's just normal. It's not normal if you're a fan wondering what's going on, but as far as the hockey goes, it has no affect."

The bad news began late Friday, when the Fitch ratings agency downgraded Greece's debt further into junk status. That gave investors more reason to fear that the country will need more help managing its debts beyond the emergency loan package it received last year.
Third Federal said OTS is concerned about the bank's heavy concentration in home-equity lines and loans, which make up nearly 30 percent of its lending. Up to 35 percent used to be acceptable, but OTS has changed that to a threshold that varies by bank and hasn't been disclosed to Third Federal, Chairman and CEO Marc Stefankski said during the conference call.
The fates of the hostages vary. If there is proof that a hostage killed civilians, rebels say, he faces execution.

Helm and his band mates -- Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel -- were musical virtuosos who returned to the roots of American music in the late 1960s as other rockers veered into psychedelia, heavy metal and jams. The group's 1968 debut, "Music From the Big Pink," and its follow-up, "The Band," remain landmark albums of the era, and songs such as "The Weight," "Dixie Down" and "Cripple Creek" have become rock standards.
The travesty of high tuition is that most of the extra charges aren't going for education.

I still really believe that we are flying under the radar and still have a lot to prove."

QK: Stickwork. Speed. Decision-making. Coaches look for athletes with exceptional stickwork with both hands — players who can shoot hard and accurately on the run.

One might ask why, if an employer is willing to maintain health coverage for its employees, are the nondiscrimination rules even an issue? The nondiscrimination rules that apply to group health plans are stringent, and many existing group health plans cannot satisfy them. Here is a real-life example. Small Co. employs an owner and seven other employees. The company offers group health insurance to all employees. The employee's contribution for single coverage is $125 per month, and the cost for family coverage is $250 per month. Presently, the owner and four employees are covered under the plan. However, three employees are covered under the plan of a spouse and have waived coverage. They have made this choice because their spouses work for larger employers who offer better or more affordable coverage.

But as careless as these teams are with the football, they’re also good at creating turnovers, with Rutgers No. 2 nationally and USF No. 17 in the country in that category. The Knights’ offense needs turnover help to be effective.
I met my husband. It's where we shared our first kiss, danced at prom and later brought our babies home to meet the family.

"The Beginner's Goodbye," Tyler's 19th novel, features all of these things and more — there is a ghost — and less; just over 200 pages, it is, both in literal weight and narrative complexity, lighter than most of the Tyler canon. Which should not be construed as "less," at least not in the pejorative sense of the word. In many ways, "Goodbye" feels like the center slice of an Anne Tyler novel, a distillation. Of all the ghosts and dislocations, of all the miscast but still loving families, tin-eared marriages and baffling children, of all the sudden tragedies that cause even the most plodding horse to rear up and take flight, finding grace and strength he had forgotten he had.
