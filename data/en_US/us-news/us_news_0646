The finest game released this year, "Fallout 3" turns the grimmest of scenarios - Washington, D.C., 200 years after a nuclear war - into an invigorating role-playing adventure.

Twelve days later, though, I reviewed her at the Theater at Madison Square Garden and she had never sounded better. Bobby Brown made another cameo, as did Luther Vandross, who was watching from the audience.

“I’m thrilled that such an outstanding teacher has been recognized.” McCann said. “It’s always exciting to be acknowledged by your colleagues.”
But the whole, blandly acted thing just feels pointless. It’s as if Rabe wasn’t sure where to go, or how. So in the second act, we’re told that half the city is on fire, then some characters smoke pot and babble on (“What’s Elvis going to die from?”).

Iverson was sincerely humble and appreciative about representing his country in the 2004 Olympics in Greece, but could not keep the lifestyle issues from shaping how he was perceived.

This time, Gaghan directed his script himself, and the human touch is sorely missing. It takes far too long to grasp the motivations of the numerous figments of his fertile imagination. (A real CIA agent was the inspiration for Barnes, but the film comes with a disclaimer saying the events depicted are pure fiction.) The bad guys are obviously, rather too much so, Texas oilmen and an extremely high-placed Washington attorney (played with malicious gusto by Christopher Plummer) whose authority to determine international policy goes unchallenged. But who are their opposites -- the ones we're meant to empathize with?

The vitriol from both sides seems to bolster the conventional wisdom that Fletcher made an all-or-nothing gambit by going independent.

The trick in making it more whisky than whiskey involves a few things. The first is the idea itself of making it on U.S. soil, which was the brainchild of David Blackmore, the master brand ambassador for Glenmorangie. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Scotch Whiskey Association - although scotch whiskey has been around for centuries more than that - and in thinking up a celebratory event to mark the occasion, the light bulb over Blackmore's went "ding, ding, ding!"

The two very different characters of each man are immediately apparent: Rembrandt looks different in each self-portrait, and not just because he’s trying on different expressions, while Degas looks eerily the same, his head turned to a precise three-quarter pose every time, allowing his huge, limpid, self-assured eyes to stare at the viewer.

Like the menu, the Bar Jules wine list is printed on a chalkboard by the kitchen. There's only a half dozen wines - all imported, including a Verdicchio, Petit Chablis, Cotes du Rhone, Barbera and Chinon. No vintages are given, but all are available by the glass with a price range of $8 to $12 ($30-$46 by the bottle). The wines are easy drinking, but not particularly selected to go with the food, which changes nightly. If you're really concerned about what you drink, the best bet may be to bring your own. Corkage is $15. There's also a reserve list that lists seven other wines, including the 2006 Sylvain Bailly Terroirs Sancerre ($45), which can be purchased retail for anywhere from $20 to $25 a bottle, and the 2005 Domaine les Paillieres Gigondas ($62), which is around $45 retail.  M.B.

-- Yes, Montero is a loss. He may not have a true defensive position. But there's no denying his ability to crush at the plate. He'll do it for years. If he sticks as a catcher, the deal might sting a bit more for the Yankees. There has been a lot of perspective shed on Jorge Posada's career in the aftermath of his decision to retire. Perhaps Posada's most important contribution was giving the Yankees a great hitter — capable of getting on base and hitting for power — at a defensive position that often provides little in the way of offense.

Poise is one of Swift’s many marks of distinction. There is absolutely no wilt in this flower.

Last week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi acknowledged the need for a growth pact to go along with the fiscal pact. Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel softened her rhetoric, conceding that she is open to discussing ideas to foster growth. Yet both Mr. Draghi and Ms. Merkel insisted that they won't support stimulus measures that would aggravate budget deficits and debt. Instead, they advocated making labor markets more flexible as a means of boosting competitiveness. The ECB has also urged Germany to do more to deregulate its services sector to allow for more competition, which could help make it easier for foreign companies to do business in the euro-zone's largest economy.
The fact that Statham's main co-star, a little girl, witnesses much of this violence with barely a wince says a lot about where the filmmakers' heads are at: Hey, we're just doing cartoon violence, nyukking it up like the Three Stooges, nothing really objectionable here. As long as you don't object to a couple hundred kill shots to the head and barrages so indiscriminate you have no clue how many casual bystanders are getting blown away along with the bad guys.
Alas, he's not sure the finish this Sunday will play out the same way.

"Long story short," he smiled, knowing he was prolonging the story, "we fixed it up so it looked a lot better. But we still struggled for 15 years with people (in Roseville) trying to get rid of us.

"One of the complaints was, 'Why are you showing this on the weekend when I'm out doing it?'" said Rucks, a former executive on the Bassmaster Tour. "It's not about just giving them a longer show. What you end up is seeing how the anglers play the game, how they find the fish, how they deal with the stress and things they never have had to deal with. We're trying to disrupt them, to make them more stressed, and by making them more stressed, making them more competitive and making them figure out things a lot faster."

ABOUT THE RANGERS: New York did well to battle back from a 2-0 deficit and tie the game early in the third period, but took a pair of costly penalties after evening the score - the second of which led to Ovechkin's go-ahead power-play goal. "Itâs a tie game, you canât take four minutes in penalties," Rangers head coach John Tortorella said afterward. "Youâre not gonna win a hockey game like that."

Oh, and by the way, the move also affects other sports, including wrestling. That is the program that just won the Big 12 championship, which is one more Big 12 title than the football program ever won.

2010 Arnot Roberts Clary Ranch Sonoma Coast Syrah ($40, 12.2%): Clary Ranch is always the most polemical wine made by Duncan Meyers and Nathan Roberts. No different in 2010, which yielded a stellar range of Syrahs by these two. Clary is always a razor dance with ripeness, and this shows an ethereal, almost stark, quality. Layer upon layer of scents: green and Szechuan peppercorn, green olive pit, brine and a deep mineral note to round out wild blueberry and plum fruit. Savory and remarkably powerful. While it's more confrontational than the fennel-tinged Griffin's Lair Vineyard Syrah ($55, 12.5%), it also aims - and hits - higher.

I hate to write. I have to force myself every day to sit down and begin. This is the first thing that I always tell students, who have absorbed the peculiar modern notion that if you are practiced at something you must find it effortless and pleasurable. Sometimes they ask how I continue, and I reply, glibly, "Because of contractual obligation." But I only manage because I live a humdrum life, in which the drama takes place mainly on the page.

Eugene Fisher, a former staffer for the U.S. Catholic bishops' interreligious affairs office has written that "virtually any conceivable organization developed by Christian churches whose aim is to proselytize or convert Jews will inevitably, because of the tragic history of such efforts, have such a chilling effect on the Jewish community of today that it would result in an inhibition of the fully free exercise of the faith relationship between God and Jews."

"I mean, this is -- you know what. There was a column written and I hope I don't offend anyone. There was a published column by a man named Ralph Voss, who was a former judge in Missouri. He now owns and writes for a newspaper in Central Missouri called the Unterrified Democrat -- what a name -- and it's in Osage County, Missouri, and he starts off and it's something like this. He said, ‘A long time ago, decades ago, the Ku Klux Klan got together and said how can we really hurt the African-American children permanently? How can we ruin their lives? And what they designed was the public school system.'"
"These statements," defense attorney Peter Fahy told Poole, "are the poster child for unreliability on their face. They evolved and developed as she was on the witness stand. You have no idea what this woman will say if she does take the stand in front of the jury."
In that case, Christie repeatedly called Feinberg’s rulings as “self-interested.” He also questioned Stuart Rabner’s decision to recuse himself from hearing the case, saying he was disappointed and would have preferred Rabner to lead rather than Associate Justice Virginia Long.
Rivas and the artistic team started their work months ago, at first not even knowing which Shakespeare play they would adapt to tell this community's story.

Managing to ignore the fact that the battle was only a temporary setback for Napoleon III, who soon conquered Puebla and ruled it until 1867, Mexicans began observing the battle's anniversary as a triumph of the indigenous people over foreign oppressors, and as a symbol of unity and patriotism. But the Batalla de Puebla, as it's still known in Mexico, has never inspired the heights of revelry seen on Sept. 16 (the country's true Independence Day). In fact, Cinco de Mayo isn't even a national holiday — except in two cities, where a battle reenactment anchors the celebration.

During the 1960s and 1970s, a series of test explosions, five times that of Hiroshima, were set off in New Mexico and Colorado to get at the natural gas. Unfortunately, the gas came up radioactive, and fear of contaminating water supplies put an end to what was to have been a nationwide bonanza.

Some polling suggests that, despite voters' continued unhappiness with the economy and Obama's handling of it, the president may be convincing Americans he's on their side.

The situation was indeed becoming dicey for the remaining Marines in the embassy, as radio contact was temporarily lost with them as they withdrew inside the building. At least two helicopters sent for them had to turn back due to weather before the last flight in finally retrieved then-Staff Sgt. Valdez and his men. The presence of a reasonably tolerant North Vietnamese Army force outside the embassy walls added to the tension and minutes before the evacuation ended, Gen. Cary had ordered Navy A7 bombers to make dry runs around the embassy to ensure there was no interference with the final inbound helicopter flight. In my opinion, Gen. Cary, an infantry and aviation combat veteran, would have personally flown a helicopter into the embassy himself rather than abandon the remaining Marines.

"Sure I do," he said. "Again, I don't want this record to continue. I want to see our guys experience what a win is like in playoff basketball and we got one more opportunity to do it here at home in front of our fans, and I'm going to push guys to be ready and try to play at a high level and play over 48 minutes, because we haven't been able to put one of those 48-minute ballgames together."
The separate proposal for raw water calls for a 50-year contract, keeping the price at its current rate of about 10 cents per thousand gallons. It also includes a condition that the county pay $11.4 million for 65 percent ownership of the city's intake structure at Lake Lanier. Earlier this year, the city sent the county a bill for that same amount to pay for upgrades at the intake facility. The bill represented 64 percent of the cost for the upgrade, but it said nothing about ceding a share of ownership.

For the main course, I'll offer stuffed shells, another favorite from childhood. At first I thought they would be too pedestrian for elegant entertaining, but when wrapped around a smooth, rich filling of roasted butternut squash and creamy ricotta, they are anything but. Sauce them lightly with a brown butter and walnut sauce; if you don't like walnuts, substitute hazelnuts. These are so rich, you need only serve very few per person.
Other possibilities include: creating a tax-increment financing district around Wrigley; using historic preservation tax credits or broadening the boundaries of a one percent tax on downtown restaurant meals used to finance McCormick Place. That tax currently extends as far north as Diversey.

Two minutes after getting to the house, next door to Antioch Baptist Church, a department captain showed up. So did a firefighter with a plow. Six minutes later — and 12 minutes after the initial call — crews from Millburn, Union and Summit arrived.
Before, during and after the game, I once again told the junk food to talk to the hand. It was not easy. One of my friends in the bowels of The Q sat down to the most beautiful piece of cheesecake ever made. I looked at it, said, "Wow,'' and kept looking at it. He thought that meant I wanted a piece, which was true and false. Five minutes later, he dropped a two-piece extravaganza in front of me and said, "Enjoy.'' Eleven days earlier, that calorie bomb would have been down the hole in less than 10 minutes.

But there is no doubt that the Pass Out Game is dangerous.
Kiz: In your blind praise for Tebow, I'm afraid you miss the point as badly as Tebow bounces passes at the feet of receivers. Tebow did perform heroics for Denver. But long after McDaniels was fired. That is what happens to an unproven coach who commits the huge error of using a first-round pick on a player unable to come in and immediately help a struggling team. It made no sense for McDaniels. Know what else qualifies as a wild-and-crazy idea? A Denver team that ranked 24th in points allowed last season using a second-round pick on an Arizona State quarterback who is likely to play as much this season as any staffer at Kickin' It Headquarters. How's that going to help Manning win a Super Bowl?
INDIANAPOLIS -- The world ended a few days ago, but that's just a little adversity.

5. The NCAA can be eliminated, at least as it relates to football. Many of its rules are archaic and frankly gibberish. The NCAA itself states that it does not have subpoena power, which is one way of admitting that enforcement of its rules is difficult.
NEW YORK — Before the revelry really began, Church Street looked and sounded like it does on most Sunday nights as another Monday approaches: Cabs jostling for position, cars trying to make their way in and around the construction zone of Ground Zero.

Perhaps no player is "due" more than Wallace. He entered the postseason as the Blazers' X-factor, a physical presence the team has lacked in recent seasons who brings relentless energy and provides scoring without having offensive plays called for him.

The scientific organization, which is a vocal proponent for federal requirements mandating increased fuel efficiency in vehicles, said in regions covering 45% of the nation’s population, “electricity is generated with a larger share of cleaner energy resources — such as renewables and natural gas — meaning that EVs produce lower global warming emissions than even the most efficient gasoline hybrids.”
They're first to the mat -- for the seventh time, which ties the "Amazing Race" record for most wins, and nets them a trip for two to New Zealand. We haven't been keeping score, but we think that brings the prize total for this indomitable pair to $20,000, a couple of cars, umpteen trips, four calling birds, three French hens and a travel gnome in a pear tree.

"But the biggest thing when I came out to visit was the atmosphere. You know, it doesn't feel like a 2-14 ball club when you come in the building. I don't really know exactly how to explain it but there was a newness. There was a life in the building when I came in, and that excited me."

TE Jake Ballard. You’re seeing the evolution of coverage against him, in that it was zone early in the season when he kept finding soft spots and defenders were running away from him. Now, you’re seeing man and he’s still being effective. Pretty soon, you’ll see defenders trying to disrupt him getting off the line. That’s the kind of attention they pay to tight ends who can hurt you. And Ballard is proving he can with leaping one-handed catches. As I said in our postgame video, it’s one thing to make grabs in zone coverage when you’re ignored; it’s quite the other to make a catch like he did with a man under him and one on top of him.

"Well, let's go back to, let's say three weeks ago," Tressel said. "We've got a lot of receivers we like to get the football to. We've got a quarterback we'd like to run seven to 10 times, and a couple tailbacks who we think are very good. So there just aren't that many balls left and I guess we could take all those balls this season that we've thrown to tight ends and give them to Jordan, then we'd be having the opposite discussion.

Obama has criticized Israel for settlement building activity that has complicated the Middle East peace process. For his part, Netanyahu took offense when Obama stated that any Middle East peace agreement would be based the boundary lines in place before the 1967 war, coupled with mutually agreeable land swaps.

These two career prosecutors were the picture of shame last July 14 after their bungled video exhibit led Walton to declare a mistrial.

Preston's H.O.P.E., at the Mandel Jewish Community Center, 26001 South Woodland Road, Beachwood: Go out and play -- it's warm enough (well, most days). Kids of all ages and abilities will enjoy a trip to this amazing playground, the largest free playground accessible to children of all abilities in Ohio. The $3 million park opened in 2008 and is named for Preston Fisher, who was born with spinal muscular atrophy, which kept him in a wheelchair. He died in December 2008, but this wonderful park honors his life. "Imagination Village" is the center of the 60,000-square-foot play area, a mini-burg of two-story houses and stores for tots to explore and play in. In addition to featuring swings and slides, there is also a Play Theatre with a performance stage and the Sand and Water Area, where children can dig for dinosaur fossils. All play areas have wheelchair-wide access ramps and walkways. There are also areas labeled in Braille for vision-impaired visitors, plus covered benches and tables, accessible restrooms and drinking fountains.

Will Portland join Joint Terrorism Task Force?: Commissioner Dan Saltzman was the lone council vote against pulling Portland from the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force in 2005. Three days after the failed bombing plot at Pioneer Courthouse Square, Saltzman called for the city to immediately rejoin the task force. Earlier this morning, I summarized why former Mayor Tom Potter and Commissioner Randy Leonard pushed the city to leave the group. That decision was influenced by the council’s general distrust of the Bush administration and its anti-terrorism efforts. With a Democrat in the White House and a liberal Portland City Council, Mayor Sam Adams seemed to signal over the weekend that the city would be more open to joining the group again. Here’s what the Portland Mercury reported about Adams’ response to Saltzman’s suggestion: Adams' response was fairly curt: "Not at this point." Although, soon after, the mayor did allow: "That doesn't mean that I won't in the future."

LOOKING BACK: Truex earned his best finish of the season at Kansas, winding up second to race winner Denny Hamlin. "Denny was able to get by me (late in the race), and once he did, the race was over," Truex said. "The car got better longer in the run, and I was able to get back to him, but I'd get three or four car-lengths from him and pick up the aero push. I guess if we can be this disappointed with second, it kind of shows how far we've come as a race team."

BLAND:While the premise of rats in the kitchen, rats in the restaurant and rats everywhere is unappetizing, the animation is amazing.

The end result didn't have enough spice for me.

It is less a comment on marriage than on the notion that marriage is the holy grail of a woman's existence, the finish line of her life's hopes, dreams and goals. That is a fable upon which the Disney company built an empire. But the fable is not confined to the multiplex.

Now more than 12 months removed from Tommy John surgery, Wainwright has had prolonged spring training. Seven times he's faced hitters in a live batting practice session. Most pitchers will only do two. For two months he's been on a spring program at the Cardinals' Florida complex. Most pitchers will have a monthlong program before games.

Nowadays Chinese leaders seem too busy putting out fires to think about their regime's long-term survival. Last month, they had to dispatch Politburo member Bo Xilai in a messy power struggle on the eve of a leadership transition.

At this time of year, many of us are torn between our expectations and our desires. Our desire is for things to be cozy, comfortable and familiar. We want everything to be like it was when we were children, or maybe like something we've only seen on Christmas cards and in holiday TV specials. And yet for many of us the expectation is that we'll run ourselves ragged at this time of year. Isn't it strange? We want chestnuts roasting by an open fire, we want that ride in a one-horse open sleigh to Grandma's house, we want peace on earth and goodwill to all, we even want to come and adore the newborn baby in the manger.

McBride added: "You may not use the card very often or you may do everything right, but a seldom-used account or an account where there is a lot of available credit -- even when everything is paid on time -- represents a risk exposure to a card issuer, not an opportunity to boost their receivables.
