Hospitality, I think, comes when people have sent down roots; it goes with pride in a home, pride in ancestors that built the home, conscious identification with a particular soil. These people, in one way or another, are all exiles. They have come here recently, and their hearts are really in the places that they left. Thus, if they do not do as much visiting with each other as you see in other parts of the country, or the gossiping that goes with visiting, they do have the quick friendliness that exiles commonly show, and I must say it is most agreeable. You may encounter many things you do not like in California, but you will go a long way before you meet a churl.

From this you could easily get the impression that American politics are trundling along as usual. But this stability is misleading. The current arrangements are stagnant but also fragile.

I suppose my mother was somewhat unusual for her time. At 30 she was  and expected she always would be  a career woman. She worked as a cosmetics rep and was happy in that job. She never expected to get married, but then she found the one man in all the world who could change her mind  my dad.
In a spate of mid-November interviews -- while participating in the president's protracted rethinking of policy -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described America's Afghanistan goal(s) somewhat differently. They are "to defeat al-Qaida and its extremist allies" because "al-Qaida and the other extremists are part of a syndicate of terror, with al-Qaida still being an inspiration, a funder, a trainer, an equipper and director of a lot of what goes on." And: "We want to do everything we can to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al-Qaida." And: "We want to get the people who attacked us." And: "We want to get al-Qaida." And: "We are in Afghanistan because we cannot permit the return of a staging platform for terrorists."

He seemed to act out everyone's fantasy of a nasty old man with a hidden and generous heart. No one granted the privilege could forget his snarly smile, his raspy, unprintable and adorable dismissals of such modern piffle as e-books and publicity tours, his misleading insistence that his life didn't matter.

A return to the wild — this time a dangerous expedition down more than 900 miles of an uncharted Brazilian waterway known as the River of Doubt to collect more specimens — left him near death with malaria and blood poisoning from a leg injury. Then the ominous flexing of muscles in Europe put TR at growing odds with the neutrality policies of Wilson. Morris' explication of this interlude is consistently rich and on point, with rapidly developing events providing a backdrop for the balanced examination he presents of his subject. TR's almost pathetic plea that Wilson authorize him to organize a cavalry brigade to fight in Europe comes as a kind of coda to the once-energetic man's richly productive life.

Personalization in online ads is nothing new. In fact, that's one of the things that makes the web such a powerful marketing medium - the power to serve up ads based on your behavior online. Websites put a small bit of code on your computer (called a "cookie") and can tell things like where you're from (hence "Leonia mom" vs. "Miami mom"). And, of course, when you do searches on Google, the "results" that come up on the top and sides are paid ads, not real results at all. And in my old internet marketer days, we knew to insert different offers into e-mails based on customers' stated preferences and their buying behavior.

A few years later, the doctor’s licenses were suspended in Michigan, put on probation in Colorado and Illinois, and revoked in Ohio. In 2004, an Illinois hospital suspended privileges because the doctor posed a threat to health or safety. Illinois suspended the doctor’s license in 2007 but put it on probation last year, meaning the doctor may be practicing.

Outlook: Packers never replaced departed free agent defensive end Cullen Jenkins last year and still don't have true complement to Clay Matthews at other outside linebacker spot.

Addition of free agent Anthony Hargrove might help defensive line, especially with oft-injured 2010 second-round pick Mike Neal sitting out first four games after violating NFL's performance-enhancing substance policy. An outside linebacker would be high on wish list. Safety also is need, as it's still not clear if Nick Collins will return from neck injury. Packers also might look for offensive line depth.

They don't just crush and slow down."
