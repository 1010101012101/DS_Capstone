Castle Dome Mines Museum. About 40 miles from Yuma is the Castle Dome Mines Museum, a love letter to the rough-and-tumble mining region. More than 30 buildings (lots of bars, as was customary), clustered together, tell the story of the 3,000 or so people who once dug out a living from the earth. Today, closed-off mine shafts dot the countryside. Many of them held the detritus of daily life and, when opened, were like little time capsules. It's in the middle of the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, up a road that will give your car's suspension — and yours — a good workout. Open mid-October to April, by appointment other times. (928) 920-3062, http://www.castledomemuseum.com. Admission $10. Take Arizona 95 to Mile post 55 and turn toward Castle Dome.

Economists love this kind of "congestion pricing." The money raised will be used to rebuild the bridge. Thus this cost will be paid by those who actually use the bridge, in direct proportion to how much they use it. The market will sort out those for whom time is more important than money from those for whom it is not — and give both drivers what they prefer. And of course it's good for the environment: Some people will reject both the toll and the increased congestion on the free bridge and use public transit or work from home.

I was at my (father’s Virginia Beach) house. I had the laptop and my TV on NFL Network during the draft. My agent (Maryland grad Josh Stevens, who also represents former Terp Isaiah Williams of the Arizona Cardinals) already had told me Saturday was going to be my day. Seven hours straight, I didn’t eat no food and watched. Every time a team that had showed interest came up, I looked at my phone. The whole draft went down. I thought Cleveland was going to pull the trigger in the seventh round. Twenty or 30 minutes after the draft was over, my agent called me up and said, ‘You’re a Dolphin.’ I said, ‘What do you mean I’m a Dolphin?’ It was just a great feeling. It was a blessing.

Start with the biggest problem: alcohol. Inflation has eroded the federal alcohol tax down to about a fifth of its Korean War level in constant-dollar terms. Analysis by Philip Cook of Duke University suggests that tripling the tax—from about a dime to about 30 cents a drink—would prevent at least 1,000 homicides and 2,000 motor-vehicle fatalities a year, all without enriching any criminals, putting anyone behind bars or having a SWAT team crash through anyone's door.

In addition to "Espíritu Vivo," an exciting collaboration between Ballet Hispánico and hotshot choreographer Ronald K. Brown, the lineup includes "Nube Blanco," by Anabelle López Ochoa.

In the end, women's votes in November, much like men's, will be determined by a broader set of issues, from gasoline prices to unemployment to health care.

The panel appointed by Mayor Frank Jackson won't look at the cases involving Sowell, but they will study how police here and in other cities deal with similar complaints. What are the best practices? How can Cleveland ensure that sexual assault allegations, even from women with sketchy backgrounds, are taken seriously? How can such women be made less vulnerable to sexual exploitation?

Mr. Bo appears to have escaped a similar fate for now. Analysts say he is likely to retain his seat on the 25-member Politburo and be farmed out to a powerless post, such as deputy head of a government advisory body, as long as he agrees not to interfere in political issues.
most of Europe should contain the potential for wages to push higher, while indirect tax rises might hold down spending, he said. Thus, the data was not a "cause for alarm," he said, and inflation should drop below 2 percent before midyear unless commodity prices rose markedly further or the euro declined

And Best Buy recently hired former Starbucks Chief Information Officer Stephen Gillett to run the company's worldwide digital operations.
The leaders of the movement share a common fascination with the radical teachings of Jesus, but the communities they form vary widely. Meeting sites range from homes to pubs to parks to churches to convention centers.

This politician is played winningly by Larroquette, who became well-known in TV's Night Court. His character, William Russell, is a Harvard-educated man, a liberal, and a former secretary of state who travels with a dictionary and a thirst for knowledge. Yet, he's anything but ready for a smear campaign against him. His wife, who has been quietly estranged but is now back for the campaign, is played as down-to-earth and stalwart by Bergen.

Remove the meat from the refrigerator an hour before roasting and preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put the meat on a rack set in a large roasting pan and place the pan in the center of the oven. Roast for 1 hour and 15 minutes until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 145 degrees. Remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil and allow to rest at least 30 minutes before carving. The final temperature will be 150 to 155 degrees.

Blazers forward Nicolas Batum: "Defense. Defense was the biggest part tonight. They scored 90 points -- after the 116 we gave up two days ago, we did a better job than that. They scored 46 points I thin in the first half, so our goal was to allow no more than 25 each quarter. We did a pretty good job in the first half. ... Everybody was involved -- everybody who came on the court was ready to go so that was a good team win tonight."
Professional collaboration is also crucial. Your doctor must have the confidence and knowledge of what other providers are attempting to do with you to correct your problem. Dr. Paul M. Puziss, a Beaverton-based orthopedist for over 30 years, says, "I always maintain close contact with my patients' providers to help ensure continuity of care. For complex conditions like sciatica, it's crucial that patients are provided close guidance on appropriate exercises they're willing and able to do on their own to expedite recovery."

"What happened to doctors who actually had office hours that were convenient for people and actually cared for patients? The hours are either between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., or they only have them one or two days a week. Those of us who finally found work after two years and now have health insurance can't possibly get in to see a doctor as we fear losing our jobs or not getting paid if we take a day off. Plus, you can't even make an appointment until you verify with the doctor's office you have insurance. If you don't, well you can forget seeing the doctor to begin with."
According to Oregon State Police, the dispatchers became aware of the wreck about 6:02 a.m. when they received a call from a Debra Lynn Ivie, 56, of Prineville, who said she'd been in a crash, but didn't know where she was.

The crowd, as usual, was starry: Chefs Thomas Keller, Daniel Boulud, Rick Bayless, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, José Andres and Sam Kass, the White House senior policy adviser for healthful food initiatives, were some of the many boldfaced culinary names in attendance. There were famous television faces, too, including Ted Allen, Robin Roberts and Alton Brown, the evening's master of ceremonies.

But by last year, the soldier had reached a disappointing juncture. Bales received more than 20 awards and commendations, including three Army Good Conduct medals.

The problem is that Illinois bases corporate taxes on in-state sales and CME records all of its transactions that way, even though lots of transactions are occurring in other states and other countries. When Caterpillar sells a bulldozer in Germany, Illinois doesn't tax that income. But when a CME trade is executed in Japan, that income is taxed by Illinois.
But the reward for those who do show up, Langeberg and others say, is a place with incredible views from high bluffs. A place with so many wild raspberries and mushrooms to gather that the staff orders you to keep it to a gallon per party. A place where people have been known to spot 10 eagles at one time when the rocky rapids are keeping the river too lively to freeze over and they gather near open water to watch for fish to swoop down and eat.

Still, he was uncertain whether he will play against Golden State on Sunday, even though he was confident he'd be cleared by the NBA to do so.
RA�L GRIJALVA also fails to see beyond a narrow band of self-interest. As a representative of a heavily Latino district, he faced no political risk in responding to a divisive law with an equally divisive call for a national boycott of Arizona. Grijalva, a U.S. representative, must know that lost convention business will hurt Arizonans who are struggling to keep their jobs in these tough times. For a congressman to call for destruction of his own state's economy is irresponsible and beneath contempt.

The Dutch were down to 10 men, and the ugly game was grinding its way down to a penalty-kick shootout when substitute Cesc Fabregas found Iniesta free on the right side in the 116th minute, and the Barcelona magician they call "El Ilusionista" (The Illusionist) gave it one touch and then volleyed it eight yards past the outstretched arms of Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. The goal spared the 84,490 fans at Soccer City and the estimated TV audience of 700 million a shootout.
As the start of Trending Day approaches at midnight Tuesday, Leon said he was getting more and more excited.
Overlooked: St. Vincent’s "Surgeon" begins as an ethereal pop number reminiscent of Tori Amos or Björk. Midway through the song, the rhythm picks up, St. Vincent begins to play dazzling-quick eddies of guitar notes and the synthesizers start to twist and bend. Pretty soon, the whole track is swaying like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. And just when it seems like the structure can’t take any more strain, Bobby Sparks takes a Moog solo that could make Keith Emerson faint with delight.
If elected, Mr. Hollande has long pledged to seek to renegotiate the fiscal pact agreed by European leaders in December in order to add growth-boosting measures, an idea that has recently taken on more resonance among European policy makers.

It looks like he's swinging the bat better. I'm seeing more aggressive swings. He's going to keep going out there. He's still been an asset to us in center field."

But eight or so years later Buddy would go to Lourdes and Jimmy would take him. Jimmy was chosen because, as their mother would say, “We always said: ‘If you have a job to do, give it Jimmy, he’ll do it.” It was always said in jest, but it was true. Physically, Jimmy was big and strong enough to handle Buddy. But Jimmy also had developed a considerable degree of patience, which was especially useful whenever he and Buddy had to go somewhere. On their journey to France in October 1982, Jimmy carried Buddy on and off planes and on and off buses, careful to cradle him in his arms as he moved him in and out of his wheelchair. In the air and again at the hotel, he would feed Buddy, give him something to drink and attend to his catheter bag. To begin that Saturday in Lourdes, he dressed Buddy and combed his hair. But before Jimmy did any of that he turned on the tape recorder.

The individual mandate is the centerpiece of a complex regulatory scheme that accomplishes two objectives: obligating insurers to cover individuals with preexisting conditions, and doing so without generating prohibitively costly premiums. Achieving these goals requires what insurers call risk pooling. Broad coverage at reasonable rates is only possible when premiums of individuals least likely to require medical care offset the expected cost of care for those most likely to require it. Risk pooling does not happen by itself. In an unregulated market, healthy people do what those with pre-existing conditions cannot: They either opt out of insurance, believing they will not need costly care, or voluntarily disclose their good health to insurers to secure a low premium. The result is that low-risk individuals pay low premiums and high-risk individuals pay high premiums, defeating risk pooling.

Dear A: You are in that group, by no means a small number, who repeat a mistaken choice in partners. No one intends to hook up with two alcoholics or two abusers, but there is some attraction to that personality type. First, ignore your family. They sound not only ignorant on the subject of abuse, but also not terribly friendly in their suggestion that you are making this up for attention. Second, undo the marriage.

You are young, he is maladjusted, and marrying because of family pressure is the kiss of death. These things are better done sooner rather than later. I wish you good luck. — Margo, encouragingly

If expanded to all states, such a system could moderate American politics: It would produce candidates who would fare better in general election contests and elected officials who are more flexible and willing to compromise across party lines. This simple change could help restore civility to our politics, perhaps creating room for bipartisan solutions to our country's great problems, and revive faith in the American political system.
