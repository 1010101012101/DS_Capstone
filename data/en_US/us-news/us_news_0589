Howard Troxler: Our Republican friends would tell you it's because voters prefer Republican ideology, and Democrats would blame the whole shebang on gerrymandering. In truth there are several reasons — the Republican rise actually began under districts drawn by Democrats, remember. Republicans did a great job of recruitment, organization, absentee voting and focused message. Once they won the majority, of course, they could draw districts better to their liking, and as the majority, pro-business party, the Republicans enjoy a great advantage in raising money that helps them hold power.

The set pieces are incredibly well-crafted, usually variations on a chase, be it by land, sea or air. There are ambitious fights, including a sort-of over-the-top swordfight conducted by two massive cranes. There is also some sleuthing, and honestly, if this starts to sound any more like Indiana Jones you're going to wonder whether Tintin sports a fedora and carries a whip.

Economists say the recent recession officially ended in June 2009.

A few of the works are three-dimensional painted sculptures, standing on the floor or hanging. Even the flat two-dimensional works are painted on every side, often given angular strokes with a palette knife. Several larger pieces hang between the arches of the nave, making it possible to approach them from any angle. Some have lines of cursive script; others are collages, with stones, small metal icons, metal staples or spent shell casings embedded in the thickly applied paint, their dull brass contrasting with slashes of red paint sprayed like blood.

Washington, D.C. : You wrote on Sunday about the survey that found more "favorable" stories about Obama -- as if that was a reflection of bias in the press corps. Couldn't it be a reflection of reality? I'm guessing that writing that Obama is making people feel more optimistic and has a high approval rating would be coded a "positive" story -- but writing that Bush had a credibility problem and a low approval would be coded a "negative" story. But wouldn't you consider both "fair"? Doesn't this kind of thinking put pressure on reporters to write negative stories about positive events and positive stories about negative events, just to be "balanced"? What good is that?
We loved Katie Finneran, who won a Tony for featured actress in a musical, "Promises, Promises" (and whom we adored in the cult TV show "Wonderfalls").

A: Well, I admire the fact that you've set the tone right away. I understand that I will be asked such questions, and that's fine, because I have refurbished my horizons and self-destruction is no longer an option. I can't talk for the other George, although he has just finished a major tour, which suggests the asleep-at-the-wheel situation was a brief excursion from sanity. Adam Ant has mental-health issues, and that is very different and more serious than the sort of self-destructiveness that myself and George Michael were embroiled in. So, talking purely for myself, I can tell you that my head is firmly screwed back on - the right way - and I am a far saner human being than I have been in a long time, if not forever.

The actors sink into Huff's tough, conversational language as if they were savoring a meaty slice of pizza: Reed chews on his lines thoughtfully, Collins snaps and bites. In the course of the 90-minute, no-intermission drama, they tell stories, confront criminals and juggle conflicts on and off the job. Robert Mark Morgan's set, a drab interrogation room with a big-city skyline out the window, seems to dissolve into whatever background the stories they tell demand.Thanks to Huff's vivid writing, the actors "build the sets" themselves.

But while they are doing it, they need to be near-perfect elsewhere on the ice.
Sexual violence as a by-product of war is a theme Jolie is intent on exploring - and she does so with chilling candor. Ajla is among the group deposited at this Serb Army encampment, and Danijel is now an officer in the same compound. (The movie hinges on such twists of fate.) He sees Ajla, and then sees to it that she's left alone - she is his for the taking, and she submits, willingly.

But it wasn't just amateurs having trouble. Even some professional geeks at Gizmodo couldn’t really tell the difference.

They thought it was lighter, brighter and overall tighter.
But the farm-boy exterior conceals one of business' toughest, most ruthless managers.

But Graham Fuller offers a forceful, erudite reminder that neither Islam nor religious fervor adequately explains the animosity between parts of the Muslim world and the United States. In fact, he posits that the fissures that currently exist might well have existed even if Islam never had, and he offers a wide-ranging, at times digressive but always illuminating look at the past centuries to support that contention.
Kalmar keeps a low profile, too. Being the public face of the orchestra is part of a music director's job, while the players toil in relative obscurity. Yet, Kalmar does few high-level speaking engagements or national media interviews. He works in Portland less than a quarter of the year -- about what other music directors spend with orchestras these days -- so that if the public doesn't see him at a concert, they're unlikely to see him at all. The rest of the year, he leads Chicago's Grant Park Music Festival, guest-conducts around the world and, beginning this fall, becomes chief conductor of the Spanish Radio/TV Orchestra in Madrid.

Vrabel also has a quick, creative football mind that led him to grill his coaches about the intent behind various schemes and to offer suggestions that were sometimes put in the game plan.

Wormald: We're proud to look at this film as not a typical dance movie. We're proud of the type of film it is. Not just oh, we're in a movie, but we actually get to act and work with other great actors. It's not a typical dance movie like we've seen in the past decade.

But the dire situation did not inhibit legislators from carrying bills crafted by outside interests who showered them with campaign contributions, a continuing Mercury News investigation of the California legislative process shows.

Personnel changes won't matter much if the Timbers (1-2-1, 4 points) continue to blow leads in the final minutes of a game.

Yet mothers who relinquish babies older than 5 days are not fully protected from prosecution for child abandonment.

Take the humiliating loss in the series opener. Please. With his centers, Karl appeared to be taking shots in the dark. Koufos began in the starting lineup, but earned fewer than 12 minutes on the court, and it was difficult to remember he played at all. McGee got 17 minutes and only scored on two free throws.

Unlike some children, who try to obscure the truth and hide the pain, this girl holds nothing back. She tells Boushehry that her mom abuses drugs and that she hates his boyfriend.

State Rep. Andre Thapedi excels at winning elections, and he usually wins by ridiculously huge margins. He first won his seat in 2008 by handily defeating fellow Democrat Milton Patterson with nearly 100 percent of the vote. He ran unopposed in 2010. And while nothing is ever certain in politics, let's just say it's incredibly difficult to imagine a scenario in which Thapedi's opponent, perennial would-be candidate Bobby Joe Johnson, presents a legitimate challenge. There is no Republican nominee for this seat.

Copy editors cut their teeth on arguments/conversations over words in the sausage-making that is journalism, grammar, quotes, commas, noun-verb agreement, flabby sentences, weak transitions and, yes, facts.

Though Parlato's 2011 album, "The Lost and Found," was overlooked by the Recording Academy, it was a fixture on many best-of lists at the end of the year, including Rhapsody's inaugural Jazz Critics' Poll (formerly hosted at the Village Voice). Touching on a similarly eclectic lineup of influences that includes elements of pop, funk and Brazilian music, the record could sit comfortably next to Spalding's "Chamber Music Society," led by Parlato's lilting voice and a sharp band given ample room to shine. And like the record that helped break Spalding to a national audience, hers isn't a typical jazz recording.
After the speaker's election, Pelosi swore in the members of the new House, which moved on to its first order of business -- the adoption of rules.

In fact, Obama yesterday clearly sided _against_ those who claim we could live with (and contain) a nuclear Iran. “Iran’s leaders should know that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,” he told AIPAC. “I will not hesitate to use force when it is necessary.”

Using a bathtub as an analogy, he says: "If the level of water is going down, the amount flowing out has to be greater than the amount flowing in."
Certainly, America will need to make the painful decision required to nurse its fiscal wounds to health. In the long run, the deficits are clearly not sustainable. But, as FDR's closest aide Harry Hopkins famously said, "People don't eat in the long run; they eat every day." And today's approach will create not only more suffering but also less prosperity. In order to grow, the economy needs people who eat, people who work, people who produce and pay taxes.
The small group that will winnow down the Atlanta region’s project list met for the first time Friday, and they discussed some of the rules they’ll use. Among their first decisions, strongly backed by the state transportation planning director: They’re not ready to rule out toll projects.
Actively campaigning against the only potential solution proffered does nothing to move metro Atlanta, however incrementally, toward easier commutes. Given that transportation progress in this state moves in the lurching manner of a new motorist learning to drive a stick-shift jalopy, we’d argue there’s too much risk inherent in forcing the defeat of the T-SPLOST in hopes of generating something better.

It kind of happened by accident. We were open to the possibility and knew there were a lot of good schools in this area. My wife's background was in Montessori education. We happened to be driving down the road and saw this St. Louis Language Immersion school advertising that it was enrolling. We looked into it, and we asked, Jah, "Are you interested?" He would be going into kindergarten, and he got so excited to try that. He wants to go and be part of that environment and learn in that way. He was aware of this thing that other kids do. We enrolled him in that school, which is pretty close to where we live.
From the garbage spilling out of an overflowing bin in the only shelter from the snow, to the officious security guard who puts on rubber gloves before interacting with the jobless, lest he somehow contract unemployment from them, the line is a degrading and dehumanizing experience that should also be unnecessary.
But the outlook for the region would not be entirely rosy, a review of detailed budget information shows. Public housing developments would be squeezed for money to cover rents. Low-income households, sure to be joined by lawmakers from cold-weather states, would plead for more federal heating-assistance money.
The coolest-looking tasting room in Arizona is in downtown Jerome. It's the home of Caduceus Cellars, the label of Maynard James Keenan, a nearby resident and lead singer of the band Tool. Keenan, in conjunction with Glomski of Page Springs, has planted vineyards in and around Jerome and Cornville. Given his rock stature, the wines would sell no matter what they tasted like. But these are serious wines. It's also where you can pick up "Blood Into Wine" swag, as well as very hip vino-themed casual wear.
Over the years, it has evolved, but it's not so serious that it isn't fun. I don't usually drop names or make a note of whom I see in restaurants, but when Mick Jagger is sitting almost unnoticed in one of the booths, that says a lot. Nobody makes a fuss.
Feeling like a student being reprimanded by a teacher, I was told that the most efficient use of management's time was for the executives to generate money for the firm instead of talking to the 20 or so analysts covering the company. An analyst like me would simply have to be patient.

Like her parents, Pat, who died in 2009, encouraged her son's passion for movies by taking him on regular excursions to the Cedar Lee to see independent and foreign films.

Friday night's episode of Smackdown was a strong follow up to an exceptionally good Raw.

The results are dramatic. In 1974, people who identified themselves as conservatives were the most likely group to have a high degree of trust in science; now they're the least trustful. As Gauchat argues, this can probably be blamed on both the growing influence of the religious right, which rejects scientific contradictions of religious teachings on such issues as evolution and stem-cell research, and the growing use of science to inform public policy in such areas as environmental protection. Conservatives, ever wary of government interference with the free market, started to resent the scientists whose findings suggested such interference was necessary. Rather than debate remedies, they have turned on science itself.

The firestorm of protests across the country, like Tuesday's rally here, has coalesced around an argument made mostly by conservative Christians but also by some of other faiths.

I know Chippewa is a large street but can something be done about the timing of the lights? It took me 21 minutes yesterday to go from Morganford and River Des Pres to Morganford and Arsenal.
Back check: Loui Eriksson, Jamie Benn and Michael Ryder are solid pieces, but the Hawks should be able to handle them in a series simply because their key pieces are better and more tested.

He went through the clumsiness of dating girls, and found it forever awkward.

Brahms' "German Requiem" - a response to his mother's death - is part of a large body of "comfort" music that is easier to decipher because its text and harmonic construction trigger more familiar associations. Even with his huge orchestra, the 140-voice St. Louis Symphony Chorus, and soloists Twyla Robinson (soprano) and Stephen Powell (baritone), conductor David Robertson was able to delineate minute swells of emotion, going from massive triumphal outbursts to hushed meditation with the agility of a sports car negotiating a right-angle turn.

Because he is an entrepreneur and not a poet, Khodorkovsky was regarded skeptically for many years by the sort of people who usually defend Russian dissidents.
