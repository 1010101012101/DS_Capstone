"I think he's more of an off-guard," McMillan said. "He's score-first – that's his mindset. Setting up the team, that's something that, it may or may not come. So really, you try to let him play off the ball and allow the ball to be reversed to him and let him go. I think that's what he does best."
His own aura seemed part of the attraction.

Both kung-fu icons are relaxed and funny (Jet Li has a full-on laughing fit at one point, which is bizarre if you've only ever seen him glare), and they have surprisingly good on-screen chemistry. Even better, they fight each other, in a long scene choreographed by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen -- and it's clever enough that you almost forget to grieve for what might have been if they'd only done this 15 years sooner.

Thanks, Brent, for the column on charities in Sunday's Oregonian. The information I found very interesting was that charities sell lists of small donors. Last year I called several catalog companies and requested to be removed from their lists. I was told that it would take a few months for the request to go into effect because there were more catalogs already in the works. Suddenly, I was receiving many times the number of catalogs as before from places I'd never heard of. I'm sure those catalog companies from whom I cancelled, sold my name to other companies. I am still swamped with catalog.

It all makes for a fitting epitaph for Jones, who died in 2010, shortly after these recordings were completed. Out Tuesday. Grade: A

Zach Brown, North Carolina. As the years go by, there is some feeling among the league's scouts that this story gets played out season after season with North Carolina players. UNC has high-end athletes who carry questions about effort or on-field discipline into the draft. Brown has the size, speed and athleticism the NFL loves to see in its linebackers. But in the game video, he simply doesn't show the anticipation to make impact plays, especially behind the line of scrimmage. Perhaps he can be taught to do so, as he already possesses the foundation of speed few people his size have as the starting point.

Desserts (all $8), made by Rebecca Rader, cap the evening on a high note. A blueberry peach cobbler recommended by our waiter was one of the best around. The thick brown sugar crust, topped with house-made vanilla ice cream, tops a stew of fruit just sweet enough to bring out the flavors. Other house-made ice creams, including caramel crunch and chocolate peanut butter, were also superb - no need to go to Swensen's down the street. The black-and-white bread pudding, another signature, is topped with among the best hazelnut ice cream I've eaten.

“Drama is conflict and conflict happens because people want different things,” he says. “That conflict is universal, so we take that and tart it up, and compress it and amplify it, and sprinkle some hot sauce on it and turn it into a movie.

Shadid writes that he undertook the project to restore himself after years of chronicling the region's conflicts left him "stunned by war, and, shockingly, no longer young, or married, or with my daughter, Laila." He gives a strong impression that he had an even deeper motive than attempting to rehabilitate his soul and rebuild an ancestral home. He was trying to recapture an unrecapturable past, some of which, one suspects, existed as much in Shadid's imagination as in reality. The house of his great-grandfather Isber Samara, returned to its lost glory, would be a monument to a bygone epoch.

The tower, for instance, defies all efforts to pin it down or sum it up. It is a presence more than a distinctive form -- blunt from one angle and statuesque from another, muddy in the fog and aglow in bright sun.

Baroque theater was all about melodrama, created with lighting, perspective, and sound effects. Machines were used to simulate a horrifying wind, driving rainstorm, and menacing thunder.

"Recent Tragic Events": Originally produced at Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington, D.C., a company cited by Third Rail as a model, it was named a finalist for the American Theatre Critics New Play Award. The play deals with the aftermath of the tragedy of Sept. 11, but in a way only Wright might have conceived -- as a comedy about faith and predestination, played out through a blind date in Minneapolis that somehow involves a visit from Joyce Carol Oates as a sock puppet. Third Rail's February 2005 production instantly put the new company on the Portland theater map, earning five Drammy Awards.

And it seems that the little area of the 6th that was moved to the 3rd District had been Republican to begin with, which will only make the 6th more winnable for the Democrats."

A few of the mid-majors to keep an eye on:
Perjury is a serious crime and there should be remedies to prosecute anyone who lies under oath in a court of law or a congressional hearing.

In hindsight, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have been so friendly. I should have pushed a bit more. The sickening public corruption that now paralyzes Cuyahoga County was already then in full swing.

At the Judge's Table, it's Pomeroy, Cardoz and Milliken who have made the most-successful dishes. Oseland loves the combination of sweetness and spice in Cardoz's shrimp dish, while Simmons praises the perfect execution of Milliken's shellfish.

Half-Italian (his mother is from Bologna), Samson, who is a partner and the executive chef, is cooking Italian food that is more gutsy and accessible than you might remember when he was at the more formal Valentino.

Mormons believe God the Father has a material body. It's one of the differences between Mormon doctrine and what the church has traditionally held to be true. The strongly trinitarian nature of Christianity emphasizes the unity of the Father, Son and Spirit in substance, but also holds fast to the distinctiveness of their persons. And only the Son is a person with a body. But these days, to say, "This has been the orthodox Christian position, based on scripture, on this particular issue," is often received as weak soup. Why should anyone have to listen to the consensus of the historical church on the nature of God? If I want to say that God looks like a saggy, middle aged woman, who's to stop me? Have you seen God? No? Then surely my version is just as "legit" as yours.

R.B. McLean Lumber Co., opened in 1926 and shut in 1965, was a small, family-run operation. The McLeans' proclivity for old ways and old machinery made the mill with its 30 outbuildings a natural for preservation.

The Santa Ema, which was Dave's favorite of the tasting, is a soft, round Sauvignon Blanc that's fresh and fruity. It's a well-balanced wine with fragrant, herbaceous notes.

On Friday, the Superior Court judge who granted condemnation denied New United’s motion to reconsider. Undaunted, Pemberton said his attorney will turn to the state appeals court this week, in hopes of preventing the county from starting demolition.

During medical school rotations in the internal medicine wards, we had glimpsed death beckoning to the elderly and consoled ourselves with the salve that those that passed on "had lived a good life." But Rebecca's life had only just begun.
