And therein lies the paradox that permeates the book. Living alone works best as a lifestyle choice when it actually leads to greater connection. Every singleton interviewed, even the most enthusiastic, had at least some reservations or worries: pangs about not having children or questions about spending too much time at the office, poignant questions about failed marriages or the lack of a long-term relationship, fear of facing illness or death alone. But in this way, the author notes, single people are no different from those living with a partner. They "struggle with loneliness or the feeling that they need to change something to make their lives feel more complete," writes Klinenberg. "But so, too, do their married friends and family members. ..." In other words, we're all in the same boat.

Portland residents may decide the costs are well worth the benefits. The city has many excellent schools and many improving ones, even under today's conditions. With schools in disarray, Portland is less able to attract and retain good employers, less able to graduate productive citizens, less able to maintain its quality of life. As most major American cities have learned the hard way, it's almost impossible to get the schools back once they're gone.

Plump, extra-moist chicken arrived with a colorful row of roasted carrots, dressed with a pecan gremolata that was at once herbal, pungent and slightly sweet. Leek and garlic mashers were so rich and buttery, they were more like an au gratin potato than simple mashed spuds. The entrees are fine, but the real stars at Viaduct are its large selection of small plates, drawn both from the regular menu and the Happy Hour offerings. We tried the raw oysters and split a Bacon and Egg Salad. The oysters were on par with those at any of the area's best seafood houses. As for the salad, the warmth of a poached egg was a nice addition to a salad studded with crispy prosciutto bits and dressed with sherry-bacon vinaigrette. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer

The 1999 Downtown Now plan explicitly disavowed the silver-bullet approach.

In September Swanson wrote a letter to Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and U.S. Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli, saying that any multistate foreclosure settlement should have "teeth."

Phillips, 30, is a two-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner. He didn't play Tuesday night in the Reds' 3-1 loss to the Cardinals because of a tight hamstring. Manager Dusty Baker said his speed at the leadoff spot and "acrobatics" at second base made a healthy leg a priority and rest necessary to avoid a chronic injury. The spark atop the Reds' lineup finalized his extension the day after fellow All-Star second baseman, Texas' Ian Kinsler, reportedly received a five-year, $75-million extension.

Kevin: As part of the I-64 project, an additional lane on I-270 was added northbound between I-64, and Olive and the exit-only lane at Ladue eliminated. Is this going to be reset? Also, at Page Avenue and I-170, the exit lane from eastbound Page to southbound I-170 was extended past Seven-Up Drive. It seems very tight in that area with the lanes shifting some in the middle of the Seven-Up intersection. Is this going to be reset?
GOP-leaning voters generally get this: Warning against the "European social democrat" model is one of Mitt Romney's better talking points. The problem for Mr. Romney is that he represents something of another European specialty: the dispassionate technocrat, data-driven, post-ideological, lacking in soul. GOP-leaning voters get that, too.
The site opened Sunday — the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks — to the victims' families. Monday marked the first day since the tragedy that ground zero opened to the public.

But the script – peppered with Poe references (some of which have to be explained), is fun, especially for Poe fans, who might be tempted to cast a jaundiced eye on this endeavor. Still, if the movies can give us H.G. Wells as a real time traveler (“Time After Time”), why not a Poe who is a lover, a man of action, an amateur sleuth who sacrifices all for art and love?
Analysts said they don't see any long-term consequences for HP now that it has made its decision. But there's still a big question mark: How will HP compete in the rapidly growing mobile device market?
Translation is not an exact process because words have multiple meanings. There are unique idioms and ancient terms. The translator has to choose the correct understanding. The key question for the future is: Does everyone have the ability to read the Bible and interpret it or should this be the work of scholars? If you think it should be scholars, choose Option 1: Only scholars should read the Bible.
Hayden advised avoiding whites that had been aged in oak when buying for Thanksgiving. He suggested a wine that's new to the store, the 2010 Le Cirque Grenache Gris ($14.99), which is a Vin de Pays from Côtes Catalanes in the Languedoc Roussillon region of France. The Le Cirque Grenache Gris also was imported by Dan Kravitz, and it received 90 points from the Wine Advocate.
A special cocktail selection (all $8) is as intriguing as the food menu, but the results are mixed. The idea of a Hot Tomato is good -- a deconstructed bloody Mary with vodka, tomato water, lemon and a dash of Tabasco served in a martini glass with a jalapeno pepper floating in the middle. However, the drink tasted flat. I asked for salt to perk it up, which helped to coax out the sweetness in the fruit.

Serbia, a landlocked nation of 7.1 million people in southeast Europe, is holding presidential, parliamentary and municipal elections Sunday. Whoever wins could affect Serbia's future relations with the European Union as well as Kosovo, a one-time province whose declaration of independence Serbia has refused to accept.

The question is which Lakers team will show up. Will it be the team that dominated the Denver Nuggets in the series-clinching Game 6 of the Western Conference finals? Or will it be the Lakers team that lost to Denver in Games 2 and 4 and struggled to beat a shorthanded Houston team in the conference semifinals?
Yes, SMU is headed to the Big East, and while the Big East is more prestigious than the Atlantic 10, the travel would be a headache for an SMU program that's based in Dallas. (That might not matter if SMU guarantees chartered flights.) How long would it realistically take SMU to reach a respectable competitive level in the Big East?

That is, carrying a concealed weapon -- whether by nuns, rabbis, classroom teachers, Little League coaches or that mouthy in-law who gets on your last nerve -- would be the "default" mode: You would assume that everyone whose path crossed yours each day packed heat in a pocket or purse. That might do more for etiquette than every column Miss Manners has ever published.
Allow us to elucidate. The cube is a stunningly powerful object that the U.S. government has in its possession when the film opens and that Loki wants. Frequently referred to in the comics as the cosmic cube, the tesseract gives its owner nearly unlimited power and the ability to open portals between galaxies... which is pretty handy if, like Loki, you're plotting an alien invasion.

The next phase of the marketing effort focused on elucidating the film's story line, which follows the international exploits of a SEALs team as it tries to thwart a plot to smuggle suicide bombs into the United States.

The mass platform for such music, however, has dramatically shifted since radio became big business and fell largely under the control of corporate ownership in the 1980s. But the Internet is leveling the playing field again by offering a potentially high-profile public arena for anyone making music with a message.
Is raising awareness important today? Yes – it is of life-saving importance! There may be minimum-wage workers, women who care for children or a sick family member or who transform houses into clean and beautiful homes. They are often uninsured or underinsured, lack accurate health information and face barriers to health care and health education. We want to reach this group, as well as senior citizens, because they deserve to have a mammogram and early detection information about breast cancer. Men, too, can be diagnosed with breast cancer.

There's going to be a physical entrance at our existing food court, and then probably somewhere else along that Gateway connector. The parking underneath is going to be connected to our parking.

But a combination of things finally led me to take on the challenge. One, a new generation of coaches has embraced the online information revolution, and it's easy to get a multitude of box scores with just a few clicks of the mouse.

øKeli Cain, spokeswoman for Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, says, "One of the top things we let people know is that outdoor warning sirens are just that - for when you're outdoors, such as in the car or at the park.

There is another large issue here, and that involves her producers and management at CNN. Don't they understand how Cooper earned his authority -- and how she absolutely hasn't? Do they think you can manufacture moral and cultural authority in a Manhattan office building and confer it on someone like the Pope handing out a blessing when you give them a nightly show? Didn't they learn anything from the Spitzer debacle? And don't they understand where this nation is and the desperate pain it is in?

Taking Italian flavors as a base, chef-owner Ricardo Sandoval mixes and matches with a flourish. The kitchen is particularly adept at pairing the unexpected sweet with the savory, as in the pizza with grape jam, duck confit, gorgonzola, spiced pecans, crispy sage and pears. The sweet jam and salty cheese delightfully complement the meltingly tender duck. Leek sweet potato soup is another complex treat, veering toward savory with a sweet undercurrent. The mac-n-cheese dinner also put a twist on traditional, topping not-too-cheesy cheddar and shells with grilled chicken breast, crumbly chorizo, rosemary, grilled onions, truffle oil and sweet apple.
Weintraub said he was proud to bring a positive image of Israel to a local college campus.
Trips to the City by the Bay tend to become culinary adventures. Along with sightseeing, San Francisco offers endless ways to delight the palate: fortune cookies at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, clam chowder in sourdough bread bowls at Fisherman's Wharf, or pastas and pizzas in Little Italy.

NEW YORK — By the fourth inning, the constant ticking of the pitch counter was difficult to ignore on the scoreboard behind him.
Johns Creek Mayor Mike Bodker said the resolution is fine the way it is relative to its goal.
Act 1: Chuck Lorre takes over CBS. Monday nights were never the same once Two and a Half Men took over Raymond's time period. For a while it was by far the raunchiest comedy on network TV  also the most popular and (from my seat) the funniest. Lorre then developed The Big Bang Theory and Mike & Molly for CBS. Compared to, say, a typical episode of Entourage, these sitcoms were relatively tame. But they set a new tone for network prime time, as seen in 2 Broke Girls (from Sex and the City producer Michael Patrick King).

Tomorrow night's show won't address that deficiency all at once, but it is a step in the right direction. Several locals have coaxed Mike Dillon — better known as Mike D — to a club right across the street from the state capitol building. Dillon, who comes to New Jersey from New Orleans, is probably the world's foremost punk-rock vibraphonist — and if that sounds like something of a contradiction to you, chances are, you haven't caught him in action. The musician plays jazz with the intensity of a buzzsaw rhythm guitarist, and invests his grooves with the freewheeling spirit of a funk master. Dillon has played with Les Claypool and Ani DiFranco; his 2009 release, "Rock Star Bench Press," revealed a fiery and occasionally confrontational political conscience, too. This show is a benefit: proceeds from the evening go to making the venue a permanent pop fixture in the Garden State's capital. Now, there's a cause worth believing in. Appearing tomorrow night at the Contemporary Club, 176 W. State St., Trenton, 7 p.m.; $10; call (609) 392-9727.

The FDIC entered into an agreement to cap New York Community Bank's potential losses on the loans it's buying. NYCB agreed to buy about $9 billion in AmTrust assets. The FDIC will keep the remaining $3 billion in loans to sell later.
"Hip-hop is part of our shared cultural experience," says Franklin. "In my music, I always want to have an honest approach, which for me means being progressive and contemporary.

Media, wearing required credentials, had to enter the Mo Center through a corner door on the opposite the side of the building as the double doors.

I am also a former state representative, and once received a more-than-generous General Assembly per diem, so I know that per diem money is used to pad a legislator's salary. It does not cost $183 a day to travel to Denver and live for 120 days. If that amount is annualized, it is nearly $67,000 a year in compensation solely for room, board and transportation. That amount is about $20,000 a year higher than Colorado's average salary, and it is per diem, not salary.
Read today, the study reveals a fascinating snapshot of a county largely reliant on farming for jobs and trade. It is nearly silent, in fact, on the economic promises of any sector other than agriculture. Fittingly, it was undertaken in the first place at the behest of the county's Extension Service.

The web browser is resoundingly mediocre. Explorer is a rare case where I wished for a little more onscreen guidance from Windows Phone (the Maps app is another). Managing multiple webpages was trickier than it should have been. Also, Explorer often made rendering mistakes. These errors weren't frequent, and they were never the sort that made a page hard to read. Also, dammit: it's a web browser. Android and iOS both use the same web rendering engine. It's possible that I'm just looking at a bit of CSS that had special case-exceptions for the peculiarities of those two browsers but not for Windows Phone Explorer.

They billed the library system $1.3 million and paid contractors $560,000.
The state's defense, and it has been around the block in other cases, is that one General Assembly (which sits for two years, beginning in the January of every odd-numbered year) can't bind the next General Assembly. So, for example, the 2009-10 legislature (the current one) can't necessarily require the 2011-12 legislature to do anything (as Ohio school spenders are about to find out).

If Felice's Urban Cafe were a shop, it would be the funky, indie boutique that makes you rethink colors, patterns and textures. The Larchmere shopping strip is all the better for this restored turn-of-the-20th-century home-turned-restaurant. Definitely a nighttime destination, the arty rooms glow in ambient lighting, creating a bohemian yet chic atmosphere. The menu is as eclectic as the decor. A number of specials fuse unusual combinations: a braised lamb shank entree is topped with cheese lasagna and a fried egg. Appetizers such as a grilled octopus and avocado salad stress the Spanish influence on what is essentially creative, chef-driven fare. The regular menu is a casual assortment of bistro standards such as hanger steak and frites. A wine list with many affordable options also reflects a mix of Spain and the Americas. Save room for dessert: A serving of French toast is complemented by the fluffiest whipped cream imaginable.

In California, some wineries use their winemaker's gender as a sales point, though whether that's because of a belief that women are better at winemaking or merely an appeal to female solidarity is hard to say. With Burgundy, however, the great majority of first-line customers — importers and wine buyers — are male.

As a candidate, Obama attracted 200,000 cheering fans at a speech in front of Berlin's Victory Column, and he won the Nobel Peace Prize after less than a year in office because of the belief that he had strengthened international cooperation. Critics deemed the award to be premature, and even Obama expressed surprise at the honor, amid a growing sense that the international promise of his presidency could not possibly fulfill the lofty expectations of his fans.

Stump removal is one type of mechanical control. If this isn't doable for some reason, another mechanical control to consider is a barrier. You could build an enclosure around and over, but not touching, the stump. You could make a platform to sit on, to serve as a low table, or as a pedestal for potted plants, depending on the shape of the stump and your preference. When the fungus has rotted away the stump, you could remove the structure, unless you end up liking it there.

After intermission, he led a ruggedly vehement interpretation of Beethoven's Symphony No. 4. Robert Schumann called the work "a slender Grecian maiden between two Nordic giants" (i.e. the Third and Fifth symphonies), but Bell must not have got the memo. It was a performance marked by quick tempos (even the opening Adagio was faster-than-usual), virtuosic and gritty playing. The underlying rhythmic mechanics were gunned. Bows popped, contrasts were seized.

* Is Hank (Russell Hornsby) ever going to start wondering about his partner?: One of the best scenes of the episode involves Spencer, Lucinda's godfather (also a Murcielago, as the bat monsters are known) being interrogated at Portland police headquarters. Nick and Hank suspect him of killing the stepmother. In the interrogation room (lit, as ever, like an Old Masters painting, all deep, rich shadows, as if the Portland police are drastically conserving electricity) Spencer tells Hank and Nick, "I know what you are, and I guess you both know what I am." Uh, oh. Nick and Spencer already know that one's a Grimm, and the other's a Wesen. But Hank? Instead of picking up on Nick's nervous look, wondering what Sterling is going to say next, Hank says Sterling's accurate self-description -- he can emit a loud screeching sound and all that -- is an attempt to play "the crazy card." The momentary tension was great -- let's hope the teaser for next week, in which Hank apparently sees Monroe as a blutbad, makes Hank get more serious about getting answers to what's been going on.
"From the first minute to the last minute, I don't think there was one player that pulled on a green jersey tonight that was a threat to Dallas," Spencer said. "They handled us pretty well, manhandled us. That's what happens when you're not ready to play."

I'm Black and I'm Proud"), and grunted funk jams ("Mother Popcorn," "The Big Payback") in the 1970s, with the music made in the latter period in particular living on as Brown became the most sampled artist in hip-hop history. All the while, he burned through band members, whom he underpaid and mistreated, demanding more than they knew they could give.

The idea of starting a science organization came up one night when Aaron and I were sharing memories of our grandfathers, who have Alzheimer's disease. We began to throw out ideas for combating the disease; ideas as immature as stimulating the circadian rhythm and as complex as activating endogenous stem cells bounced back and forth. We soon found ourselves inspired, fascinated and excited, and we wanted to spread the passion and wonder we found to our friends.

The Cardinal (Todd Van Voris) and Ferdinand (Jake Street) want their recently widowed sister, the idolized Duchess (Sara Catherine Wheatley) to remain unmarried. They hire a well-meaning security guard, Antonio (Vin Shambry) to keep watch over her. The Duchess, however, falls in love and surreptitiously marries Antonio. All is well until the brothers discover her deceit. The Cardinal has the Duchess secretly carried off, imprisoned and tortured by Bosola (Chris Murray). Webster's Duchess rises above her seemingly necessary dishonesty to become the heroic martyr who defiantly announces "I am the Duchess of Malfi still" as she faces death; likewise Fisher's Duchess maintains her dignity and refuses to surrender either her identity or her title.
I've been thinking about one particular area in which I think mainstream Christianity has some room for improvement, and that's the area covered by the term theodicy, most often couched in terms of "why bad things happen to good people." If God is a loving and merciful God, why did he let the towers fall and permit so many people died? If God is all-powerful, why did he allow the terrorists to succeed in their evil plot? Couldn't he have arranged things so that they got a flat tire on the way to the airport, or they got cold feet, or something else got in the way of their plans, and then September 11, 2001 could have turned out to be a lovely, sunny, and entirely forgettable day?

No one tracks plagiarism allegations in academia nationally, so it's hard to tell how often they occur or whether they're on the rise, said John Curtis, research director for the American Association of University Professors, which advocates for faculty. Occasionally, a case will make headlines, but others are treated as confidential personnel matters, he said. Last year, two University of Kansas professors were censured for research misconduct after the university discovered four academic papers contained large amounts of plagiarized text.

2. May 13, 1977: The night I had my "Springsteen calling." It was supposed to be a concert by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes at the Monmouth Arts Center. But Southside was ill and couldn't perform, so Steve Van Zandt and Bruce headlined the Asbury Park All-Star revue. It was a combination of the Asbury Jukes, the E Street Band, Ronnie Spector with Van Zandt and Springsteen doing the lead vocals. This night I really felt the power and genius of Bruce Springsteen.

Those whom I have interviewed have started scholarship funds in a lost loved one's memory in order to make meaning of their loss. They lean on spiritual beliefs for support. They hold annual rituals like candle lighting at significant dates, such as birthdays, to keep the missing person present in their lives. They give lectures about dealing with loss. They participate in focus groups with other people dealing with loss. Sometimes they make profound life changes, like Phylicia's half-brother, who decided to become a Baltimore police officer in response to her disappearance.

Worst trend: Theater companies are increasingly scheduling their runs at the precise same times as other theaters — opening and closing on the same dates, performing on the same days of the week. Then there are arid stretches where nary a professional production can be found. Can’t everyone get together before a season begins and agree to play at different times? That way, more New Jersey theatergoers could avail themselves of their fine productions.

The vitamin supplement Geritol, which once touted itself as a tonic for "tired blood," sponsored an array of '50s shows, including "To Tell the Truth" and "Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour" — which Gallen has put online. Geritol was made by J.B. Williams, later bought by Nabisco, then sold to Beecham, which eventually merged with what is now GlaxoSmithKline, whose legal department, from the looks of it, is the size of Iowa.
Because of the letter, Eclips Salon owner Dawn Libbert said, "we thought we were locked in" to the leases and lacked the flexibility to begin scouting other sites on their own timetables.

I've done it hundreds of times and I always save all my energy for the last little bit."

Now the Tigers are hoping a pitcher with a 3.33 ERA and a 89/32 K/BB ratio in 146 innings for Seattle can make a difference for them. They sent left-hander Charlie Furbush, outfielder Casper Wells, third baseman Francisco Martinez and a player to be named to the Mariners for right-handers Doug Fister and David Pauley on Saturday.
A sharp critic of modern poetry's obscurity, Gioia has sought an alternate route in the pleasures of narrative and traditional rhyme and meter. At their best, his poems remind us that story and song are inseparable from the words they're made of. But Gioia's fourth book is not his best: Rhymes clang, meters march, language lies flat: The "mildewed paper" of old letters "reeks of regret." When Gioia writes of a deceased child, and his own struggle to express his loss, we see how powerful his poems can be. Too often, though, there's too little beauty to pity. Grade: C
* Employees and directors don't have to be law-abiding Oregon citizens. They can be drug dealers moving from other states to a place where the grass is greener, and they can be convicted violent felons recently released from Oregon prisons.

NCAA President Mark Emmert last month said he would support a four-team playoff in college football, and Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany has said he, too, would consider a four-team field.

Toni Malone's towering burgers may be the most ambitious in all of Los Angeles. Yet there are no contrivances here: no custom-ground meat blends, no willful denial of ketchup and no flavors fortified by what might otherwise amount to a chemistry experiment. Instead, the restaurant's signature burger is a tender, hand-formed turkey patty, a crispy lattice of turkey bacon, a firmly fried egg, a single slice of cheese, sweet mashed yams and wilted collard greens on a gently toasted sesame-seed bun. It's a triumph of maximalism, a burger in expert balance despite its seeming overabundance of ingredients.

The trades the Blazers made Thursday weren't about getting additional flexibility this summer. They already had that. The moves weren't about saving money, or getting healthier, or younger, or more experienced, or taller. The moves removed two of the biggest issues in the locker room.

You may need a lab coat to fully appreciate Mandalay Bay’s newest epicurean experience, Fleur. From the mind of culinary whiz and “Top Chef Masters” cheftestant Hubert Keller, Fleur is Sin City’s first restaurant to offer cocktails infused with liquid nitrogen. Even without a degree in chemistry you can enjoy the outlandish tableside presentation that freezes your drink into a delicious boozy sorbet. After imbibing like a mad scientist, try one of Fleur’s signature flights. The aptly named Decadent Flight includes white chocolate, chocolate coconut and espresso martinis. The restaurant also features one of Vegas’ largest collections of absinthe, as well as a secluded wine room that houses more than 3,500 vintages. We’re told the menu of gourmet small plates is impressive as well, but we were too mesmerized by the nitrogen infusions to make it to our table.

Later, Staci wakes up. The two new mothers are no longer captives, they've presumably ascended to heaven with their babies. It's revealed all along the women had been in Purgatory, after having died on the operating table of abortion clinics. But because Staci attempted to miscarry even after a second chance at motherhood, and because she never accepted the error of her ways until she experienced the physical joy of giving birth, of seeing her children for the first time, she will be doomed to eternity in Hell.

Similar proposals, which had been pushed for years by advocates who argued that severe neglect of the elderly should be treated with the same gravity as the mistreatment of children or pets, ran into resistance from the politically powerful care industry. Industry officials were concerned that providers and workers who make honest mistakes or missteps would be treated as criminals by overzealous prosecutors.
Financially, this system is paying for itself, just slowly. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power charges me less than half a penny per gallon, so technically, gray water has saved me only $95 in water costs so far. But it's also reduced my sewer charge by about one-third, saving me an extra $3.30 per month. In drought-prone Southern California, gray water feels like the right thing to do. It's been the easiest, most sensible, hassle-free, sustainable system I've put in place at my house.

It reminds Afghanistan and its leaders that, ultimately, it is their job to secure their own nation, cut their own deals and govern appropriately. It promises no unseemly rush for the exits, but rather another decade of assistance, including military assistance, with the work of special operations forces continuing on the ground.

In the past few months, I've stayed at four hotels whose eco-friendly credentials are impeccable: the Felix and the Burnham in Chicago; the Westin Times Square and the Ink48 in Manhattan.

My trip started in Brazil, where I gave a presentation at the 62nd Brazilian Botanical Conference in Forteleza. There I met Joaõ Batist Silva, a fascinating 68-year-old Brazilian plant collector.
