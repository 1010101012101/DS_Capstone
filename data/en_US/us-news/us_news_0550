"The Brewers' issues are narrow, specific and manageable. If they want this series to return to Miller Park, it pretty much comes down to Game 3 Wednesday night. Simply, Yovani Gallardo must pitch the game of his career. We all know he's 1-7 lifetime against the Cardinals. He has to pitch so well that he cannot count on more than a handful of support runs against Chris Carpenter at home. You know Carpenter is coming back for Game 7 if there is a Game 7, so the Brewers have to get to him now in a game that should have far less scoring than the debacle in the valley Monday night."

Of all the locations, the Henry River Mill Village has a backstory that's nearly as colorful as the plot of the movie. The mill, which opened in 1905, produced fine yarn. The village was designed as a planned community with company stores, walkways and green spaces. In 1966, a sheriff was shot and killed in the village by a mill worker. By the time Shepherd bought the town, three years after the mill closed, there were Thursday night poker games on the street, "and by Sunday afternoon, they were all drunk and shooting."

He wants to bear witness, to be a human rights activist, but putting himself out for public viewing brings a new kind of agony.

La Strada boasts one of the city's most unusual dining rooms. Wooden tabletops, stucco walls and ornate chandeliers combine with wrought iron, stained glass and quasi-religious icons to lend the space a Christianity-meets-Islam vibe. A kitchen with a wood-fired grill is visible from the balcony that runs along one side of the restaurant; so is the Federico Fellini film " La Strada," which flickers silently above the heads of diners below. Veteran restaurateur Terry Tarantino, who also owns the popular (and well-lighted) La Dolce Vita, in Cleveland's Little Italy, created for La Strada a menu as disparate as the decor. It is divided into soups, antipasti, meze (appetizers), pizza, pasta-primi, kebabs, and Mediterranean street food. Expect to eat something inspired by Spanish, Moroccan, Turkish, Italian and/or Greek cooking.

Without having seen Dibella conduct himself at the table, it's hard to know how to interpret that sort of a sigh when you're a mere observer of the action. With so much in the pot, and the improbability that Dibella is holding a huge hand after three-betting pre-flop, I would almost never suggest that Julius should have folded. Yet in my experience, I've come to the conclusion that if someone first sighs, then raises me, I'm almost certainly dead unless I'm holding the nuts.

Braka, one of London's leading art dealers, is a tall, proudly skinny man well known for his occasional Alice Cooper eye makeup and a general heavy-metal aesthetic that he nurtures. He has exceptional and varied taste—not only in art, but also in decoration—and a refreshingly wide knowledge of things outside the art world. Graham is an artist who specializes in painting oversize insects across four sheets of handmade paper; they give the impression of having been unfolded from a giant, 17th-century leather-bound volume documenting new species. Braka and Graham are both strong personalities with a bold sense of style and a common interest in nature. "The scale here is huge, this big empty landscape, with its large oaks and great skies," Graham says of the Norfolk terrain. "I have replaced my favorite Wiltshire downland for sky."

The 49ers' second-round draft pick said via Twitter that he'll wear No. 23, noting he wanted to "be like Mike." Of course, he wants to emulate Nike pitchman Michael Jordan. James' loyalty to all things Nike dates back to his days as a Texas high school player. He didn't consider scholarship offers from Adidas-sponsored schools such as Arkansas and Mississippi State. He signed with Oregon, the alma mater of Nike CEO Phil Knight, who has given an estimated $300 million to the school's athletic program. "No three stripes for me," James said on KNBR on Monday.

There's a touching central story in "Tickled Pink," based on Rudner's 2002 novel of the same name that contains big chunks of autobiography. It's about an unlikely but strong friendship between two young women and how that bond is sorely tested by their intersecting, up-and-down careers. When "Tickled Pink" focuses on the evolving relationship between Mindy Solomon (Emma Fassler), a dancer-turned-comedian, and Ursula Duran (Annie Abrams), a willowy model Mindy meets when she first moves to New York, the show gains confidence and energy.

Cameron played a role in the change at Facebook. A 1991 graduate of Harvard, he had written about his transplant efforts -- and the struggles to find donors -- for a class reunion booklet. That was read by a former classmate and friend, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer at Facebook. At a reunion last May, Cameron recalled standing at a mixer when Sandberg told him that she had read about his efforts and had been thinking about the struggle to get more organ donors. "She said: 'I think we can fix that,'" Cameron recalled. "It was a chills-up-the-spine moment."

“I have friends who would go gaga over an olive; I am not one,” said Muncher Heidi Heleniak.
If we were unsure about what we should be doing, it might have been because our training manual consisted solely of cartoons. In one picture, a nice, oval kiwifruit wearing movie-star sunglasses held a tape measure to a wide, lopsided kiwi in a top hat. "Too wide, mate," the nice, oval guy said in a speech bubble. The big-boned kiwi slumped over in shame. I couldn't help envisioning his pathetic little face when I was throwing the misshaped fruit down the dumpster chute. What was I doing?

--How do you sell merchandise for a green movie? With green businesses, of course. The Lorax, perhaps the most famous anti-industrial crusader from children's literature, is getting just such treatment. Universal Pictures will begin promoting "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax" this month. The animated movie is about a creature who "speaks for the trees" and fights rampant industrialism. The studio's nearly 70 launch partners -- including the Environmental Protection Agency and Whole Foods Market -- are seeking to latch on to the Lorax's nature-friendly message. The EPA, for instance, is using the Lorax character to help promote low-power appliances that carry the Energy Star label. Hilton's DoubleTree hotel chain is sponsoring a trip for four to eco-tourism mecca Costa Rica. Presumably a lot of greenbacks are also changing hands as part of the deals. (Associated Press)

Now, your other part of the question was are we going to be expanding? I've just begun taking proposals on a per restaurant basis for expansion of the program. The reason I put it that way is that we work with our general managers very closely. So I would never sit here in my office and dictate: "Beer and wine everywhere." I would say later this year, probably second quarter, you'll see one or two more restaurants with beer and wine.
"They have the right to view it any way they wish. ... But I'm telling you it is. It is our heritage, and we will honor it," said Mark Simpson of Spartanburg, whose great-great grandfather was a Confederate soldier.

There are many ways to make an occasion at home shine, including the invention of a signature drink in honor of your sweetie. Vicky Oliver, author of "The Millionaire's Handbook: How to Look and Act Like a Millionaire, Even if You're Not," suggests personalizing an ingredient, such as fresh-squeezed orange juice for a mate from Florida or Russian vodka if he was born in Moscow. She suggests adding personality, such as splashing it with "one shot of fresh-squeezed orange juice from your sunny home state" rather than saying, "Just add O.J."
The agreement demands that at minimum the medical mart be 82.9 percent full of tenants during the first two years. The convention center is expected to be occupied at 20 percent of capacity during those years.

And it's hard to imagine many people will be more excited for Mr. Obama in 2012 than they were in 2008 -- a point even President Obama concedes on the stump. It's not just the sour economy either. Americans who were exhausted with George W. Bush were open to Mr. Obama's rhetorical grandiosity in 2008. Now they know the man, and while they may still like him, far fewer people love him, which may help explain why Democrats are raising less money in 2012 than they were at this time in 2008.
We are highly optimistic that through this aggressive TNVR program, Cumberland County can reduce its euthanasia rate for cats, which as of 2010 (latest figures available), was at 76 percent. Cape May County with several municipalities endorsing TNVR, has a 10 percent euthanasia rate.

The Predators wound up outshooting Phoenix 25-24, but they had chances with the net open they simply missed with Radulov and Kostitsyn on the sideline. Radulov leads Nashville with a team-high six points in the postseason, and Kostitsyn is tied for the team lead with three goals.

After winning the free-agent auction for Peyton Manning, the Denver Broncos will trade Tebow. And that's inspired a media parlor game, with everyone trying to predict Tebow's destination. Florio isn't predicting a Tebow/STL union, but he may have been the first national football writer to put the Rams into the conversation. (I also think that Florio was trying to have some fun with this; so let's keep that in mind.)

Though Headley is in his fifth season as a big-league regular, and plays a mature if understated game, he is susceptible to many of the same anxieties that afflict most ballplayers.

Our entrees, a filet mignon ($29) and Fennel-Crusted Pork Tenderloin ($20), were polar opposites, in terms of calorie count and intensity of flavors. A perfectly cooked, buttery-tender filet came with a cornucopia of richness -- almost-molten goat-cheese potatoes brimming with butter and cream and a generous drizzle of Bearnaise sauce. The slight bitterness of wilted spinach was a good foil for the over-the-top opulence of the other components.

Tourism, of course, is the lifeblood of Easter Island, yet there are concerns about just how many visitors the island's delicate archeological treasures can handle.

It's getting better. We're seeing 25 new customers a week — people are recommending us to their neighbors and co-workers. Our business this year is up 11 percent over the same time last year. What we saw during the worst of it was people worried about paying their mortgage and setting aside money for their kids' education and paying down credit card debt.

It’s true, in a way, that Jeter has been through this drill before, when Paul O’Neill hung up his uniform, when Bernie Williams was no longer in center field, when Andy Pettitte stepped away from the game in 2010.

Many in the trade see what Friedman is doing as bold and refreshing. High-end designer Timothy Corrigan thinks "the architecturally inspired lines have a timeless quality," but cautions that the company "shouldn't go too deep into distressed wood and rusted metal because it's a very specific look that can be limiting in the future."

Efron is a bona fide leading man now, and he ably carries the weight of the romance on his sculpted shoulders. Unfortunately, it's not much to carry. The bags of dog food have more heft than this plodding, paint-by-the-numbers romance, and Efron isn't given much to do beyond look good in boxer briefs. All the soaking-wet outdoor-shower-sex scenes in the world can't make up for the lack of chemistry.

øWe are surprised at the number of people who bring children to our place. It would be okay if the children were well behaved, but many are not.

Our menu and sale items are quite expensive, and we are not set up to accommodate children.

The tie itself seems to be a misprint. The USA hit the near post and the far post and could have scored, maybe should have scored, five or six goals. It is hard to imagine elite forwards could miss so many open-goal shots, including one in the final ticks of overtime by the best player on the field, Abby Wambach, the world's best female player in the air.
