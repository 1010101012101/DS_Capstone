His firing last week has shaken China's political establishment, and exposed such high-level divisions just ahead of its once-a-decade leadership transition beginning this fall. The highly unusual purge has raised questions about whether the party can restore the internal political unity needed to preserve its grip on power.
"It's less common in large groups," McGlothin said. "Sometimes, it's an honest mistake. A large party will get to talking and forget who's paying, but they remember and come back. We've had that happen twice in the last three weeks. They're always so embarrassed, and quick to apologize."
St. Louis - and 11 other U.S. cities that host Anheuser-Busch breweries - might be well-advised to pay attention. When InBev bought Anheuser-Busch last year, it left itself a contingency that could allow it to close breweries. Guess what that was? Right: "New or increased federal or state excise taxes."

But this sale held a twist. River View got city approval last June to shrink its boundaries, excluding the 140 acres.

“The risk would be if a player worries too much or carries too much pressure based on the past performance of the organization,” said Carr, whose title is sport and performance psychologist and coordinator. “The risk you have is a player who puts on a uniform that says they’ve not been very good, so the expectation is not high, or the player who puts the uniform on and says, ‘I have to turn this thing around myself,’ which can then create additional distractions. That’s the challenge of sports at any level.”

'Somersault," an affecting debut feature by Cate Shortland, follows a 16-year-old Australian girl named Heidi on a journey of self-abasement that leads, via dangerous detours, to self-discovery. The film has its faults, as first features often do -- the writing is uneven, the pace is leisurely. (Slow pacing afflicts many Australian films that aren't first features.) Still, Ms. Shortland has announced her presence as a new filmmaker to be taken seriously, while her star, Abbie Cornish, gives a performance that starts impressively, and gets even better as it goes along.

Instead of the frying pan and the fire, "Away From Her," a beautiful debut feature written and directed by the young Canadian actress Sarah Polley, gives us the frying pan and the freezer. That's where Julie Christie's Fiona puts her trusty skillet after washing it in the kitchen sink -- it's a first sign that something is wrong. In fact, something is terribly wrong. This vivid, handsome woman in the fullness of her life has already been beset by the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Worse still, she knows it, or at least suspects it. With a chilling combination of clarity and detachment, she tells her husband, Grant: "I think I may be beginning to disappear."
Ms. Rice's North Korean misadventures are worth pondering for what they say about her instincts and judgment: her readiness to put hope before experience, reward bad behavior with concessions, allow her subordinates to flout the explicit instructions of the president and—if Mr. Cheney's account is to be believed—more or less baldly lie to the president about the terms of the supposed deal the U.S. and the North had struck. The shame is that Mr. Bush blessed all this when he ought to have reprimanded Ms. Rice, if not fired her outright.
There are times, really, when Brio's crowd-pleasing instincts pay off for everyone. The $2.95 bar menu, available during weekday happy hour, includes things like a shrimp cocktail, fried ravioli and a fantastic hamburger, quartered into a bite-size pieces.

A: I spoke with a representative from Qwest and they said they do not use any kind of soil sterilant when they bury phone lines. Phone lines are low voltage and, as such, would not emit much of an electromagnetic field. The cable used should be shielded, so if there are any emissions, they should not affect plant growth. Another thought is that the phone company disturbed the layers of soil enough so that there are next to no nutrients in the plants' root zones (top soil, where most of the nutrients exist, is very thin in the Phoenix area). Although not pleasant to contemplate, you might consider removing the top 12 to 18 inches of soil and replace with new topsoil or heavily amend the existing soil with some good organic matter.

Rather than see this as a failing, Goldberg was inspired to write a book in defense of ideologues.

Homeowners planning or building decks need to look at the whole picture before choosing decking. If a composite is the choice, keep in mind that low-maintenance is the correct description, not no-maintenance.

This week 150 years ago in the Civil War opens with Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beuregard ordering his troops to abandon Fort Pillow in Tennessee and, soon after, nearby Memphis. Federal forces have recently seized the nearby northeast Mississippi rail junction of Corinth, prompting Beauregard's move. His forces remove guns and supplies from Fort Pillow as they begin their withdrawal. Union forces occupying Corinth essentially control a key railroad line, several rail links between Memphis and other points in the South. On June 6, 1862, Union gunboats and rams on the Mississippi River open up the naval battle of Memphis before dawn, approaching from just north of that city. In an hour and a half of fighting, the Union sinks or captures all but one of the Confederate vessels _ mostly converted river steamers _ that are seeking to defend Memphis. Spectators line the riverbanks, watching the battle that opens with long-range volleys from the federal attackers. The fight descends into shooting and chaotic attempts at close range by opposing ships to ram rival vessels. The Confederate fleet is defeated. Soon after, the Union flag is raised in Memphis as the city surrenders. A vital Southern city and trading center on the Mississippi has fallen into Union hands. The Associated Press, in a dispatch June 13, 1862, reports the destruction is great around Corinth as the Union takes control there. "The Confederate army has stripped, for food, the whole country north of Corinth, and many of the inhabitants are in a starving condition," AP reports. It adds Confederate forces retreating from the Union forces left behind "half burned locomotives" and spies and deserters report the Confederate army there to be "greatly disorganized, mutinous and deserting."
Ohio Republicans have a different take. When the Rasmussen numbers came out, Ohio Republican Party spokesman Chris Maloney said, "This survey corresponds to previous Republican, Democrat and independent surveys which illustrate an increasingly competitive race for U.S. Senate in Ohio. The fact that Sherrod Brown can only muster 43 percent of the vote in a state where his name has appeared on ballots for thirty-eight years, proves that he's clearly out of touch with the interests of Ohio voters."

While Drew doesn’t have a significant need for life insurance, she should consider long-term care insurance, which can help pay for care if she needs it when she’s older, Pirrello says. She should investigate policies when she’s in her 50s. Another strategy to consider is an IRA conversion, Pirrello says. She’s got a hunk of cash on the sidelines for a possible home purchase or to help pay taxes on a conversion, a move that would provide future tax-free growth and retirement distributions — not all at once, but perhaps a portion of the accounts each year.

What rational basis is there for telling same-sex couples they can't marry? Why … none, really, as the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wisely confirmed Tuesday by upholding a federal judge's decision that Proposition 8 violates the U.S. Constitution. There has to be a good reason for any law if it restricts the rights of a group of people who have long been the targets of bigotry. Proposition 8 never had such a reason. It was, rather, an ill-advised expression of bigotry that the court exposed.

Two years ago, when city leaders were finally coming to terms with the fact that they were out of money and might have to impose layoffs and service cuts, they began to scramble for alternatives. One was to rail about the poor job Los Angeles does collecting money it is owed, and about various inefficiencies and money-squandering practices — and to set up a commission to study what to do about it.

Part of the problem is the retro plot, which requires us to believe in a Communist conspiracy out of “The Manchurian Candidate,” old-school Soviet assassins (complete with Rosa Klebb boots), and a mad Boris-and-Natasha plan to bring on nuclear war. But these days, apparently, Russian spies just want a paycheck and a good school district in the suburbs. They’re capitalists, too — why would they want to see it all vaporized in a mushroom cloud?

One of his clients, Nancy LaVoise, had battled diabetes for much of her life. In 1999, she was trying to lose weight and develop a healthier lifestyle, so she talked to her doctor about her options. He told her about a new drug, Avandia, which he believed was showing good results. He felt so strongly it could help her that he wrote several letters requesting insurance coverage for Avandia for LaVoise. Just two years later, LaVoise was rushed to a local hospital after suffering a heart attack, which required triple coronary artery bypass surgery. Now 72, LaVoise works as a clerk for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Griffin believes GlaxoSmithKline knew of the dangers of Avandia when it marketed the drug to doctors —including a 45 percent increase in the risk of heart attack.

Walters said he headed to the arboretum on his own, asked to have a CHIERS van sent in case the subject needed to be taken to detox and called Dan Moeller, the 9-1-1 caller. The only change in information: The suspect had moved from the arboretum to the visitors center restrooms. Walters drove westbound U.S. 26 towards the arboretum. He parked across the street on Southwest Fairview Boulevard, under a TriMet sign. The first thing he did, Walters said, was park and put on rubber gloves, and then talked to them two arboretum staff members who met him outside the visitors center: Moeller and Matthew Sinclair, the arboretum's executive director. The staff told Walters the man had been in the restroom for 15 minutes.

However, Carruthers, who was elected to the board last April, said he does not believe it is a sound practice. Because taxes are not collected to make the bond payments, the district purchases short-term or "rollover" bonds to make payments on long-term debt. In December, the district issued $1.4 million in bonds issue to make payment on the 2004 bond issue. Carruthers said the $52,157 price tag for the rollover bond issue was too costly and he believes the district should start paying its bond debt off through property tax collection.

The premise of the new Pepsi MAX ad is the same from the 1995 original, one of the better loved commercials from Super Bowl XXIX: Delivery drivers from the rival soft drink makers form a short-lived friendship in a diner over music. The first ad's song was The Youngblood's "Get Together." This time around it's "Why Can't We Be Friends" by War. They sample each other's drinks and the Coca-Cola driver prefers the Pepsi product. And then the friendship comes to an abrupt -- and funny -- end.

Though the precise amount that Apple handed over in taxes last year is in dispute, the Times cited one study that estimated the company paid a rate of 9.8 percent on profit of $34.2 billion. That's a far sight better than the 25 to 28 percent most people pay in the middle-income brackets.

On any bag or container of fertilizer three numbers will be listed on the front: 20-20-20, 10-30-20, etc. Although these numbers are usually referred to as N-P-K (representing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), they actually represent the percentage by weight of these three ingredients. So a 100-pound bag of fertilizer labeled 10-10-10 contains 10 pounds of nitrogen, 10 pounds of phosphate and 10 pounds of potash. The rest of the weight is filler that allows us to spread the fertilizer evenly and to mitigate the possibility of burning the plants with too much fertilizer. See, you probably should have paid better attention in math and chemistry classes.

Whether you agree with Baker or Albright, one thing is certain. Bailey is a loner, an American original in the tradition of humorists such as Mark Twain or Rube Goldberg. As Crocker curator Diana Daniels notes in her brilliant catalog essay for the exhibition, "it is not surprising that he and his art have often befuddled critics." But she points out, "the observations of satirists and humorists often outlast the quirks and frictions of an age and in the long term provide much richer insights."

As his character, Will Salas, explains in a terse voice-over, humans have been genetically engineered to stop aging at 25. And from that birthday forward, they're on the clock, with a balance of one year ticking off in glowing green digits across their forearms.

The energy bill is far and away the most important piece of legislation still pending in this Congress. The bill is loaded with incentives to help propel the U.S. economy toward greener, more secure and more sustainable energy sources.

Mac McBride: "Terrific Derby this year; one of the best in decades. Colts from all over the country peaking - lots of speed, some nice closers and, of course, 20 runners. That last item is key. It makes the 10 furlongs very much a rider's race. You better have a good one in the boot, and it helps if said rider has Derby experience. Which is one of the reasons my tab is Creative Cause to win it all. Tickled with the fact that he runs his race every time, that he's got the breeding and style to handle the mile and a quarter, and that his appearance there is part of a long-range plan by his handlers. But what may be best of all is the young lad on his back - Joel Rosario. There may be riders in the country who ride as well as him right now - perhaps a few, but none better. He'll be up in time to win a real thriller. Put Union Rags in the two hole for your exacta."

"There is no way for the user to set temperatures in between those values," said Campbell. "In addition, there's no way of knowing what temperature is even meant by high or low."

Tweaks under consideration include reinforcing vulnerable sections of the battery's case, one of the people told the Free Press. The case was punctured during a government crash test this spring, causing a Volt to catch fire three weeks later. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last month simulated the effects of the crash test in three Volt batteries, and one caught fire after sitting around for a week. NHTSA then opened an official investigation into the extended-range electric car.

The bloom is off the rose of tilapia, according to a story in today's New York Times. The flip side to what's been considered the perfect factory fish - and happens to be the most popular farmed fish in the United States - is environmental damage from “intensive and unregulated” tilapia farming, mostly in Latin America and China (less than 5 percent of the tilapia we eat is farmed within our borders). Add to that the fact that wild tilapia “has squeezed out native species in lakes throughout the world with its aggressive breeding and feeding,” and the picture isn’t pretty.

The Los Angeles City Redistricting Commission, composed of 21 political appointees, has proposed a map of 15 reshaped City Council districts, which probably do what a majority of the current council members, the mayor, the city attorney and the controller intended them to do: They secure districts and fundraising opportunities for favored incumbents; they punish members who act too independently; and they pave the way toward election for various aides and pols who are looking for a start in electoral politics or a comfortable landing place after being termed out in Sacramento. In other words, they turn the worthy goal of redistricting on its head. The commission process has been an utter failure and should be scrapped.

Boyer is the only Cardinals player with his number retired who is not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, a fact that Hall of Fame writer Rick Hummel has attempted to remedy in recent years. Boyer may be a surprise as a No. 2 seed in this tournament until you look at the consistency of his performance for the Cardinals. From 1958 to 1964, Boyer never had fewer than 90 RBIs, never hit fewer than 23 homers, and never batted lower than .285. He was a .300 hitter in four of those seasons, and in seven consecutive years he had an OPS+ well above the league average at his position. Boyer won the MVP in 1964. But then you knew that. Hallahan won a league-best 19 games in 1931, and his nickname was, of course, "Wild Bill."

øAbout the team: The All-Joe team was created in 1992 by longtime USA TODAY NFL writer Larry Weisman as a tribute to Joe Phillips, a 14-year defensive lineman who did yeoman's work for the Kansas City Chiefs that season. His effort in the trenches didn't lead to much glory … unless you point to the 29 combined sacks of Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith, Kansas City's fifth-ranked defense or the team's wild-card run. USA TODAY has honored the unsung Joes of the NFL ever since. Only players who have never been named to the Pro Bowl during their careers are eligible.

The ground game is back, at long last. Pass protection was pretty good, especially considering they didn’t know David Baas was out until five hours before kickoff.
