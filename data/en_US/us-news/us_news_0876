We condemn Mr. Weiner’s actions and his lies, and if he was from Baltimore, we would certainly not endorse him for office. But he’s not from here. He’s from New York, and ultimately, it should be up to his constituents to decide (as the voters did for Senator Vitter and Congressman Rangel) whether they want him to represent them.

No matter what transpires next, the HCEA leadership has failed miserably because Christmas will have come and gone and all the county employees, except those represented by the teachers union, had an extra $625 to spend.

After weeks of back-and-forth with the federal agency that took over the property -- the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- I offered to buy the house to return it to Texana.

For a large winery producing 100,000 cases of wine, nudging above 14 percent costs an extra $120,000. To the largest producers, there are good reasons to keep alcohols low.

Four years after winning the White House, Obama is dealing with a different economic and political reality as he seeks re-election.

The warrant was issued Dec. 13. Cooper turned himself in to St. Louis County authorities on Dec. 22, Mininni said.
These last few nights when the Tigers havent started until after 10, the choice of early evening programs is easy. Celtics/Hawks and Bulls/Sixers are taking a huge pass. Im locked into the Caps and the Rangers or the Flyers and the Devils. Im not pandering to the hockey fans when I say that because most hockey fans know that Im not one of the savants. And switching from the NBA to the NHL is a bit of a jolt for me. The NBA is in my DNA (thanks to the Golden State Warriors). The NHL is not (The California Golden Seals didnt have the same effect).

øOne final run for Marty? New Jersey's Martin Brodeur hasn't said he's going to retire, but he's turning 40 and it's clear that he's not as leak-proof as he once was. But he displayed some of his old magic in the Game 7 triumph against Florida. Does he have enough left in the tank for another long drive to the Stanley Cup? Brodeur is a smart, calculating athlete and he can see that no one in the East looks invincible. That could be the extra motivation he needs to restore his roar for another memorable run. The Flyers won't take Brodeur for granted. They have seen his act for many years.

After about 10 seconds, Michael was let out of the cordoned area and patted down around his waist. He wasn’t given a reason for the pat-down, and in the sober, somewhat intimidating environment, he didn’t ask.

“And a bad show today is just a lot more depressing,” he added. “When you’re playing shows all the time, one bad show doesn’t matter. But now? We have to make the most of every opportunity we get. Do we like the other band on the bill? No? Okay, we’re not playing. Do we like the venue? No? Fine, forget it. You really have to insure that you’re going to have a good time or it’s not even worth setting it up.”

The lobster roll (whole $17.95 or market price; junior $12.95 or market price), a new menu item, was stuffed with the meat of a whole Maine lobster. Customers have the option of dressing the sweet shellfish with mayo or butter. Choose mayo. The lobster was expertly cooked (tender and juicy on its own without help from the mayo), chilled and laid out on torn romaine lettuce. Grab a fork and approach the roll like a main-dish salad. (One suggestion: While Maine lobsters are alluring and quite tasty, using Florida lobster in season would be a good move for a local independent eatery.)

Gran Classico Bitter ($32): If you took Campari, made it more compelling and filtered it through a 19th century prism, you'd wind up with this bitter liqueur, made by a Swiss distillery from an original Turin recipe.

Nixon works part time selling men's clothing in Pittsburgh, about 45 miles away, and works as a substitute teacher for $75 a day - less, he said, than the janitor makes.

Owned by the Reederei Thomas Schulte company in Hamburg, Germany, the Cap Beatrice was sailing under a Liberian flag and was leased by the Hamburg Sud shipping company, the 16th largest in the world. Since launching in 2007, her route was usually a 70-day round-trip to various ports between Australia and the United States.

The prints in this exhibition, though, came a different route (as do most prints in collections). The Norton Simon acquired about 70% of its ukiyo-e from the estate of Frank Lloyd Wright, who had traveled to Japan several times in the early 20th century, buying and later dealing hundreds of the prints.

Sandusky retired from Penn State in 1999, a year after the first known abuse allegation reached police when a mother told investigators Sandusky had showered with her son during a visit to the Penn State football facilities. Accusations surfaced again in 2002, when graduate assistant Michael McQueary reported another alleged incident of abuse to Paterno and other university officials.

Roth’s first fiction book, "Goodbye, Columbus," appeared in 1959, a month after he turned 26, but in 1969 it was his relentlessly salacious comic novel "Portnoy’s Complaint" that catapulted him into public consciousness — and public controversy.
The expansion of Pacific East from Cleveland Heights to a second shop in Woodmere is a welcome one, something that becomes obvious if you try to snatch a piece of red snapper nigiri sushi from the plate. The rice underneath won't come with it. The plump, glistening piece of fish is just too thick to wrap around anything. What a great problem. And what a perfect symbol for a restaurant that serves plenty of very good cooked Japanese food but continues to place as much, even more, emphasis on sushi.
EUGENE - Eric Roedl, who is in his ninth year overseeing the financial stability of the athletic department at Temple University in addition to serving as the school's deputy athletic director since July, has been named executive senior associate athletic director for finance and administration at the University of Oregon, according to an announcement by the Ducks' Athletic Director Rob Mullens Thursday.
2) The original “Plus-One Format,” where two teams would be chosen after the bowl games to play in a national title game.
I am one of the lucky Pacificans who gets polled via phone every time a parcel tax survey is conducted. In my opinion, these surveys have been "contrived" to get the results they want. They are worded so that you do not give a "Yes/No" response. You are given two choices to reply to the multiple questions with slightly different scenarios. Are you "more likely to agree" or "less likely to agree"? With this survey, the people who paid for the poll will ensure themselves that the results show the taxpayers of Pacifica support the parcel tax. An unbiased survey would ask, "Would you support a parcel tax of $48 to help fund JUHSD"? Yes/No.

We are vulnerable to crazy voyeurs, pedophile predators and rapists. Our privacy and protection is sacrosanct to us and therefore should be to society as well.

The memo represented a significant departure from its sensible October 2009 guidelines that essentially assured dispensaries and patients that the federal government was not interested in going after operations that complied with state law.
As LaHood wrote in his blog on Oct. 11, "the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago features one of the most hopelessly tangled railway bottlenecks in North America." Construction of the "flyover" bridge will "quickly put 1,500 men and women to work." Once built, the "flyover" will, LaHood said, "eliminate construction and backups" for 78 daily Metra commuter trains, 14 Amtrak trains and 46 freight trains.

When added to the approximately $15,000 previously committed, almost $23,000 has been poured down this rat hole of litigation, with no end in sight — money that could have funded athletic and entertainment equipment for the township’s children, bought additional bullet-proof vests for our police officers and numerous other benefits.

A casino/hotel/condo complex has to go a long way to brand itself as more than a poker parlor and CityCenter has succeeded by taking the high, high road. It's slightly insane — too much of a good thing? — but strolling through CityCenter's shops and hotels is probably the best fine arts afternoon in the state of Nevada. It doesn't replace the Las Vegas Art Museum which closed in February 2009 because of financial difficulties, but it's free.

Citizens oppose this, so democracy itself must be trashed - particularly in majority minority cities. In Benton Harbor and Pontiac, the governor has invoked Public Act 4 and appointed emergency managers with extraordinary powers. The emergency managers can break all city contracts; abolish all city offices; sell off the public's assets; pass and revoke laws, all without consultation or approval of the citizens' elected representatives.

The couple started dating in 2005 after meeting at a celebrity poker tournament in Las Vegas, according to Paper magazine. "I was asking him for advice," says Phillips, who had previously dated Sean Lennon. "Every guy at the table was flirting with me but Danny. He wasn't laughing at my jokes. I was like, who is this Danny Masterson and what does he think he's doing? We started texting that night ... It's been really cheesy and peaceful. There's no craziness or neediness. It's the way it should be."

The video went viral, attracting more than 200,000 hits and spawning multiple copies. Today the 55-year-old mayor of Pendleton's sister city says his appeal attracted help and worldwide news coverage. The prime minister's Cabinet secretary called to apologize. A Tokyo Electric Power Co. manager said sorry in person.
Reached at a school assembly Wednesday, Alderman Darren Small replied, "No," when asked whether that had been his experience.
He played his game as hard as it could be played for longer than most defensive players have ever played it. Twenty years in the pros, and college before that, and high school football before that. Again: We don't know if brain injuries brought Junior Seau to yesterday, but we know that he wasn't just leading with his shoulder pads all those years.

Whether either Mr. Netanyahu or Iran's fractured and erratic political leadership would heed calls to change direction before a confrontation becomes inevitable is anyone's guess. Certainly recent history offers little cause for optimism. But with its options rapidly narrowing, that may be the most the U.S. can hope to accomplish under the circumstances as it seeks to defuse an increasingly dangerous situation.

His other hobbies included photography and collecting antique clocks because "I'm a time watcher."
Stoudemire was unavailable for Game 3, an 87-70 loss at Madison Square Garden Thursday. The defeat was the Knicks' NBA-record 13th straight in the postseason, including the last seven with Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony on the team. However, Anthony was at least on the floor on Thursday. Stoudemire knocked himself out of action, and the backlash from fans and media has been relentless.

With the receding snow, runs are melting out and the links between chairlifts are disappearing despite efforts to move snow around at Highlands. That meant skiers would have to walk between lift rides to reach the summit in order to hike and ski Highland Bowl for another week, Hanle said. Top-to-bottom skiing at Highlands is also getting iffy.
Coppinger, 29, of St. Louis, was not rehired this year because she cursed, not while she was on the job, but when she went to take a drug test mandated for all city employees. She accidentally flushed the toilet, which is prohibited, and said she swore out of frustration because the delay in giving another sample would mean she would miss a job interview.
In half English he says something about how computers take a photographic image plus a mold of the real McCoy (that's Italian for actual item), then replicates it.
Trouble bubbled to the surface in the second. Santana reached a 2-2 count with Braves second baseman Dan Uggla. The next two pitches presented an omen: A changeup and a slider both missed.
Wall Street is also worried: A ratings agency this week downgraded the trust fund’s credit rating for last week’s round of borrowing. Moody’s Investors Service said its outlook for the state’s transportation funding system is "negative," saying New Jersey’s nearly $40 billion debt burden and depleted operating revenues would give the trust fund little flexibility in the event of an emergency.

State Sen. Scott Beason, a Gardendale Republican who sponsored the law, said the Justice Department's letter shows the importance of compiling information. "They are asking for the same student information we tried to get. They are proving our point," he said.
One of the most useful minor changes is the dictation feature that Apple added. It allows you to type email messages, notes or other documents by simply speaking, rather than typing on the device's virtual keyboard. It's similar to the voice-recognition feature in the iPhone 4S, except that the new iPad's version doesn't also include that device's Siri feature. So you can't get directions or tomorrow's weather by simply speaking into the gadget, as you can with the iPhone 4S.

There were conflicting accounts on the number of dead in Wednesday's attack, ranging from at least six to at least 10.
Tenor Andrew Griffiths, acting as the group’s spokesman, charmingly called Wednesday’s program “a whistle-stop tour of Renaissance polyphony.” With the mood enhanced by a slight haze of incense burning in the cathedral, the soaring beauty of Stile Antico’s sound was immediately apparent in Nicolas Gombert’s “Magnificat Primi Toni.” In William Byrd’s “Laetentur Coeli” and Thomas Tallis’ “O Sacrum convivium,” the singer’s voices bloomed, while maintaining an exquisite balance.

We've been pretty fortunate to escape the gray and the drizzle the last few weekends, and at the risk of jinxing us, it looks like that pattern should keep up this weekend, too. Fortunately there are record stores to celebrate, great local bands to hear, Belgian-style beers to drink, and national parks to enjoy. That's a healthy sampling of this lovingly-curated list of Portland events.
Congress appropriated only $50 million of the $150 million the Obama administration requested for the lab in the current budget year, which the White House said was insufficient to begin construction.

5. Juan Jose Haedo, Argentina, same time
If I've asked this once, I've asked it a hundred times: How is it that the city and county are using tourist-tax money to build a billion dollars in venues, but the one venue that actually attracts tourists remains a neglected eyesore? How is it that the Citrus Bowl, the venue that brings in the most money and cost the least amount to build, is an afterthought?
I went to visit the showroom and found more than 40 types of artificial grass. As with everything, price dictated quality. Those made out of a blend of polyethylene and nylon yarns are softer.

Zoldan and Team Valor are looking for back-to-back wins with their horse Went The Day Well in Saturday's Derby field of 20 thoroughbreds. A back-to-back by an owner hasn't happened since Penny Chenery scored with Riva Ridge and Triple Crown winner Secretariat in 1972-73.

Second, we are training Afghan Security Forces to get the job done. Those forces have surged, and will peak at 352,000 this year.

Republicans say all the breaks should be renewed, even though doing so will cost the government $3.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Pew Economic Policy Group. Maintaining tax breaks for those families earning $250,000 or less would cost $2.2 trillion, Pew estimates.

While "The Method Gun" looks spiffy -- the period outfits are particularly good -- it doesn't go nearly far enough. For starters, the premise makes little sense. An avant-garde director might imagine a "Streetcar" without its leads, but why would an acting teacher lose all its major, meatiest characters?

His dad was a popular Michigan governor, but that was a long time ago and Mitt has not lived in the state for 46 years. The ties are growing tenuous. Four years ago he won the primary against John McCain, but, in that race, Romney was the favorite of the right wing. This time around, they have a new darling, Rick Santorum. Born-again voters are being reborn for Rick while shunning Mitt, the political apostate from godless Massachusetts.

They can't chance Fairley and Leshoure becoming Charles Rogers 2.0, unquestioned talent tilting toward self-destruction. And as we learned from the former wide receiver's implosion into a haze of abusive, reckless behavior, you can't stop somebody hell-bent on ruining his life. You can't trust that they eventually will learn that the first stumble could be justified as a mistake, but the subsequent stumbles are willingly made choices.

"Hello, Dolly!" is a big musical and the Audrey Herman Spotlighters Theatre is small. Its in-the-round stage is only 13-by-16-feet, so the current production spills over into every available corner and aisle.

“Definitely, I let (the dimensions) affect my approach,” Teixeira said before the Yankees-Phillies split-squad game Sunday. “The reward of pulling the ball in Yankee Stadium as a lefty is great. I won’t deny that. And there’s no reason I can’t continue to pull the ball. But on that middle-away pitch, rather than smothering it to the second baseman, I need to hit that ball up the middle or the other way. I need to hit more singles.”

For the second consecutive game Barnes shot above 50% after going through a six-game slump. His 11 points featured strong outside shooting (three of four from three-point range) and hustle plays. For the second consecutive game, Blake provided efficient play after being saddled by a lack of confidence and poor execution for most of the season. But Blake's 10 points on four-of-seven shooting showed he was more confident in looking for his shot and knocking it down. It remains to be seen how sustainable this is, but strong bench play will go a long way toward giving the starters rest and sustaining leads.
But he never lost his love of acting, a fire kindled as a schoolboy. He made his screen debut at 34, in “The Punisher.” He began racking up strong credits in his 40s, with “Braveheart,” “Michael Collins” and “The General” — and, during the next decade, delighted his four boys by taking the part of “Mad-Eye” Moody in the “Harry Potter” series.

But then he began feeling similar discomfort in his left hip — and the diagnosis was worse. The bone was dying. He required surgery. So, just as DU was making its historic run to the NCAA Final Four a year ago, Babb was recovering from major surgery. Doctors drilled holes in Babb's left hip to promote blood flow. The surgery was a success. In his third year at DU, Babb made his college debut in the Pioneers' Feb. 17 season opener against Ohio State. He has started all 11 games for 10th-ranked DU, which is 7-4.

The Cardinals sought Theriot to reshape their middle infield and, with Lance Berkman, provide a catalyst for better internal chemistry, as Mozeliak said. His reputation was clear in the comments from his new teammates during Winter Warm-Up. La Russa talked about Theriot as a potential leadoff hitter and prototype "gamer." Albert Pujols called him a 'smart player" and someone "who knows how the game should be played." Others remarked how he "hits behind the runner" and "takes the extra base" and "brings that needed presence" to the clubhouse.

"It's as nervous as you can be as a player,'' Pierzynski said in the euphoric visitors' clubhouse at Safeco Field after he caught Humber's game.

After World War II, Hoiles purchased two more papers. His son, Harry, became the publisher of the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph, and his daughter, Mary Jane Hardie, became associated with the Marysville, California Appeal Democrat in 1946. A year after the purchase of the Gazette Telegraph, that paper entered a strike of its employees, who were members of the International Typographical Union (ITU). The strike action began in January 1947 and R.C. refused to make a satisfactory contract agreement with the local involved. Picketting ceased in July, but the ITU did not give up its efforts. It funded a competition paper, known as the Free Press, which existed for at least two decades. A similar occurrence took place in Lima, Ohio, when Hoiles purchased the News there in 1956. In the interval the Freedom Newspapers had expanded to include the Odessa, Texas American (1948) and three other Texas papers (1951), the Brownsville Herald, the McAllen Valley Evening Monitor, and the Harlingen Valley Morning Star. The Anaheim, California Bulletin was acquired in 1962.

Otherwise, "Book of Secrets" stands out as a fun family film, noteworthy for generally strong character development, writing, and acting, as well as admirable action sequences and nearly flawless visual effects. While it may not be a standout in excellence, it should keep the whole family entertained.

The Gonzalez Goodale scheme was in many ways centered around this progression, which also subtly symbolizes the maturation of the larger city over time.

Here’s the problem for you, Liz: We’re not talking some elaborate, arcane, confusing financial irregularity here that nobody can understand. Everybody gets this. It’s letting everyone think you’re something that you’re not. It’s letting stand the idea that you’re part of an aggrieved class of people. It’s a sin of omission, which is not as bad as a sin of commission — like, you know, the typical political ploy of pumping up resumes with fake claims of combat heroism and purple hearts. But it’s a huge problem nonetheless.

D. A. Powell will never be a poet who conveys a sense of place. He's too much of a devotional poet for that. Instead, his poems affirm the vanity of life, the imminence of death, the need to reconcile the two, and the fortification of the soul. It's a poetry of clarity and order -- a poetry, in other words, of poise.
"It's not 100 percent contained, we're not there yet," Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, said this afternoon. "We've still got a lot of firefighters out in the field — 500 — but we still haven't gotten all the way around it. They're getting close."

Before I can defend the use of an admittedly human tradition, I want to acknowledge that some of the traditions and rituals of the Church rise to another level. My friend would not have asked the same question about baptism, for instance, or the Lord's Supper. These "rituals" (which we would also call sacraments) are clearly biblical and were instituted by Christ Himself. The vast majority of Christians do not consider these practices optional. And yet, it's right here where the conversation over rituals and traditions usually falls apart, at the point when we talk about what is "biblical" and what is not. Here are a couple of things that need to be acknowledged by those who promote only biblical practices in the church.

Portrait of a Bookstore (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Take Tujunga Avenue north from Ventura Boulevard, then pull over between Woodbridge and Moorpark streets. You have just arrived in suburban paradise, although it comes with a fatal footnote. Begin by nibbling, sipping and browsing in the home and patio that have been converted into Aroma Coffee & Tea Co. (a.k.a. Aroma Café, 4360 Tujunga Ave., Studio City; www.aromacoffeeandtea.com) and the neighboring bookshop, Portrait of a Bookstore (www.portraitofabookstore.com).

Blake filed for bankruptcy in 2006.

The actress used to give herself an "out date" where she'd pursue something else if she didn't get work by whatever deadline she set. The date never came.

Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia. No one knows for certain how the invasive snake entered the park.

Hamas had used the six-month cease-fire to build up its stocks of rockets and other arms, much of which were smuggled through a tunnel network beneath the Egypt-Gaza border. Hamas seeks to duplicate Hezbollah's strategy during the 2006 war.

An uphill approach shot presents no hazards but always plays deceivingly long because it's all carry and again leaves players unable to see the landing area.
