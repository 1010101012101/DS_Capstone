So it's Tennessee Williams' "Baby Doll" redone for the bottom half of a '70s drive-in double bill, with one kink: The central relationship remains pure and above-board, even when you think it's going to get all porny on you.

This is yet another clear indication that Dwight and the Magic are officially separated and will soon file for divorce. Dwight did not attend Magic games right before he had surgery and will not attend Magic games after he's had the surgery. This can only lead us to believe Dwight does not want to be a part of any team coached by Stan Van Gundy.
After testing out “America built to last,” “Win the future” and “We can’t wait,” the Obama campaigned arrived at the one-word war cry that immediately drew unflattering comparisons to the “Lean Forward” advertising slogan of liberal-leaning cable news channel MSNBC.
There are five layers to the cornea, and the innermost layer -the endothelium-allows fluid to seep inside the cornea to nourish the other layers. It also pumps fluid out of the cornea. When its pumping mechanism fails, as in Fuch's dystrophy, there can be a buildup of fluid in the cornea, leading to excess eye watering and blurry vision.
On stage, actors were walking through a transition, from a character smelling the approach of snow in New York to the delusions of a character who imagines she's landed in the Antarctic. But the actors, who are reflecting on the snow scenes in"The Empire Strikes Back"as they wait for cues, seemed uncertain of the lighting. Newell never shouted toward the stage. He put his hands in his pockets, walked to the lip and said, more with matter-of-factness than impatience, "I don't think I've ever had a group of actors more responsive to lighting. We'll respond to you, OK?" Then he turned and walked back, taking small strides, his head down.

As this is a restaurant with very good manners and breeding, an apology and removal from the check was immediately forthcoming.
• Frantic finish boosts Huskies' recruiting class -- Bob Condotta, Seattle Times: The late additions, coupled with the Monday commitment of safety Shaq Thompson of Grant High in Sacramento — considered the No. 1 safety in the country — helped propel UW up the recruiting rankings. The Huskies were ranked No. 20 nationally and fifth in the Pac-12 by Rivals.com and 22nd nationally and fifth in the conference by Scout.com. Washington had been in the 40s nationally and ranked in the bottom half of the conference heading into the week. Washington's five new assistant coaches, four on defense, were given much of the credit for the late haul.

You can trot out all the charts and graphs meant to show running backs are a devalued commodity in the NFL. How it's possible to find them later in the draft. How the top offenses in the league are pass-first attacks. It's a good argument (so long as you admit wide receivers are just as easily found outside the Top Five). It just falls apart when you apply it to the Browns, Richardson, and the 2012 draft.

While a rowdy game of volleyball takes shape on one end of the lawn, and a gaggle of children plays tag on the other, the cook remains inextricably tied to the grill. Perhaps he -- or she -- runs laps to the table, depositing platters of charred hot dogs or smoky salmon fillets. He might even scarf down a quick burger in between basting. But until the last guest has filled a plate, the griller mustn't abandon his post.
øIt's just like the transition when you went from high school to college, when you're the big fish and suddenly you're not anymore. I had to bide my time. I was playing a lot. I wasn't getting the shots I wanted to. So it's similar to that transition. I've done it before. This time around it's a little bit easier to not get frustrated, to be a part of the team and do whatever you can to prove yourself to the coaches to gain their trust.

Going overboard with heat, as we detailed months ago in our review of the excellent Shoki Ramen House, can overwhelm the palate, deaden the taste buds and diminish the overall experience. I witnessed a man at Shoki practically melt away, beads of sweat forming over his brow, as a bowl of super-spicy broth got the best of him. The advice here is simple: Know your tolerance for heat, then go up in small increments if you feel adventurous.

Again, that's just an idea that Romney floated, not a specific proposal. The Journal cited two other, more substantial suggestions that Romney tossed out at the fundraiser: barring high-income taxpayers from claiming deductions for property taxes and state income taxes.

While he is signing some of them, 25 on Friday alone, he is occassionally attaching snarky messages. He noted that SB 769, an "urgency" measure that will allow a mountain lion to be stuffed and displayed at a Kern County museum, won overwhelming bipartisan support.

Michael Silver, Yahoo! Sports, on Tom Brady: "Go ahead and talk about his supermodel wife, bemoan his offseason affinity for life in L.A. or compare his haircut to Justin Bieber's. Knock yourself out, but you're missing the obvious: In his heart and at his core Brady is a football player, fierce and proud and trying to eviscerate his opponent on every level. He also happens to be one of the best quarterbacks ever to live, and during Sunday's nationally televised clash – coming off what he regarded as an utterly embarrassing performance – Brady merely had one of the most impressive games of his ridiculously proficient career."

Why not? I'll assume legal changes could make this possible. (I can hear the attorneys cringing right now!) Then we'd need some sort of retirement trust framework -- sitting within the retirement account -- to acquire cash from other retirement accounts and become the owner of the property. Then folks could go out, shop, and start the formal buying process where the trust acquires the home. (I know somebody will tell me this is already doable through some weird legal structure. I'm talking about a simple thing not requiring multiple attorneys!)

I am enormously grateful to our parents and talented educators, but I sense that this fundraising flies under the radar for those without school-age children. When an elementary school needs to raise more than $325,000 every year to fund programs my generation took for granted, we no longer have a real public education system.

Pages 225-264: Portland police Officer Jason Walters told jurors his background before he described the March 22 shooting. He said he has a four-year degree from Western Washington University, with a major in sociology and minor in psychology. He joined the Oregon Police Corps Academy, and was there for 17 weeks, and then was hired as an officer.

Walters told jurors he works day shift, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., with Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays off. He works what's called District 860, which includes the Hoyt Arboretum, and has worked that the last five years.

A good example is St. Stanislaus Kostka, the church just north of downtown that has been locked in a property and authority battle with the Archdiocese of St. Louis for seven years. Since its foundation at the end of the 19th century, St. Stanislaus has had mostly Polish members who chose to worship there because the Mass was celebrated in their native language, and because the rest of the membership recognized a familiar Polish culture.

We've taken both the 5.4- and 6.2-liter V-8 Raptors through this section, and there's no hesitation in our mind that the Baja Series is not as gifted as the Raptor (nor should it be). But the difference between the two, given the Toyota is a much less modified and unique truck, is impressive. We'd guess the Baja Series is about 80 to 85 percent of the way to the Raptor - albeit much smaller, lighter and likely to cost less.

Our taxi took us through the dusty town of Duong Dong and down a dirt road lined with little patio restaurants; a cemetery, crammed between two bars; and a bamboo hut that served as a laundry. Although I had a moment of doubt, our driver insisted that just ahead lay La Veranda, Phu Quoc's first five-star resort.

"I personally contact hundreds of constituents each week by phone," wrote five-term Rep. Tim Johnson, 65, of Urbana. Actually, that didn't surprise us in the least; it's the first thing anyone says about Johnson.

It was brought to the United States and celebrated in the press, but after the director of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam declared it a fake, the painting was withdrawn from a 1949 Van Gogh exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. (The Met's curators termed it "strident in color, weak in drawing, and uncertain in the modeling of the head.") Other experts hired by the U.S. Treasury—which was responsible for determining the painting's authenticity since original artworks can be brought into the country duty free while reproductions are taxed—concluded that "it was a real Van Gogh and therefore exempt from import duties." Today the painting is omitted from Van Gogh catalogs, and its whereabouts are unknown.
Brock, who will also oversee the wide receivers, has the background to support his pro-style ways. He spent the past three years in Boston College’s pro-style attack, the final one as interim offensive coordinator, and in 2006 was the wide receivers coach at North Carolina under offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti — the guy he is replacing.
That's done at the college level, too. Except that the staff hands out helmet decals instead of cash rewards.
President Barack Obama has made 20 visits to swing state Ohio since taking office in January 2009 -- a growing number that his Republican opponents have seized on as they attempt to characterize him as a campaigner-in-chief.
On the spending side, Romney has said he would slice $95 billion from the deficit “right off the top” by granting states the right to opt out of the federal healthcare overhaul, killing it before it fully takes effect. He would also eliminate funding for a host of programs, including the national endowments for the arts and humanities and money for Amtrak and the Public Broadcasting System.

The brief proceeding was a prelude to what could be an explosive trial that would highlight the seamy side of a sport that has been rocked by allegations that some of its superstars, including Clemens and sluggers Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, used performance-enhancing drugs as they were breaking major league records.
Turner has a sensibility that others don't have, says his longtime partner, Luis Barajas, current publication director and co-founder of Flaunt. The two have been together since Dallas, where they founded Detour magazine in 1987. They moved to Los Angeles and started Flaunt in 1998. Turner, who was the monthly fashion and culture magazine's art director for a decade, was known for his innovative die-cut and embossed covers and creative pop-ups that often made the magazine resemble a cutting-edge, adult activity book. One issue featured an Eames chair that readers punched out and assembled. A promotional ad sported a black-and-white beach ball insert; another, a bag of sand to promote the film "Sahara."
øVery likely, mesosaurs did bear their offspring live, instead of laying the almost fully-grown young in eggs awaiting hatching, Sander says, "but (Piñeiro and colleagues) are being appropriately cautious." He points to the same adaptation, bearing live young, seen in later sea-dwelling reptiles. "This is one way that evolutionary science works: We suggest how things may have happened, we look at the fossils, and we see what they tell us about how features really evolved."
Orlen has made progress despite hurdles. She is a newbie in a district where many power brokers are long-timers. The school lost the equivalent of five teaching slots to budget cuts this year. And she underwent grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatment in December and January. Her cancer meant she was largely absent from the school in January; doctors said she would be too weak to return until late February, at the earliest.

The hamburger could have been great with more attention to detail. It was big and juicy and delicious, but the bun couldn't carry the load. We were surprised to learn the buns are from the excellent Village Bakery in Davis. If it had been fresher, perhaps, the bread would have held together. The extra-large steak-cut fries were among the best we've tasted.

I know that unlike the situation with the football team under first-year coach Randy Edsall, who had a nationally televised win against a depleted Miami team in his debut before things unraveled quickly, the expectations were not very high for Turgeon's team. Turgeon has said all the right things and the Terps have definitely improved. But is there a point that the fans will get a little tired of the late-game mistakes as the losses pile up?

Even the non-medical reader will have a sense of sweeping generalization in these pronouncements. If every moral lapse indicated "problems in the prefrontal cortex," most of mankind could be said to have disordered frontal lobes. And, if all the emotionally rigid people in this world were tallied, a large proportion of mankind would have disordered temporal lobes. Disconnects in Amen's logic include: first, there is no agreed-upon standard for evaluating moral lapses and emotional rigidity; second, brain imaging cannot detect attributes of individual personality; and third, there is no direct correspondence between obvious frontal or temporal lobe brain disease, including Alzheimer's, and the behavior Amen would attribute to these brain areas.

"If they feel this UMDNJ system is going to be in flux, I am very worried we are going to lose some of the talent," Oliver said.
THE FACTS: They did in July 2010. But that's because they deferred for 18 months a 3.5 percent raise in 2009 as part of a deal with former Gov. Jon Corzine that guaranteed no layoffs. The 7 percent Christie cites combines the 3.5 percent raises over two years.

The finish was "disappointing," Colaiacovo said. "It's not us. It's bittersweet. We all feel ecstatic that we got the win, but a lot of us are pretty upset by the way we finished. You can't let a team like that get any life. You can't let a team like that scratch and claw, especially when we played so well for 55 minutes of the game. But at the end of the day, we battled hard and we found a way to win. Our special teams were huge. We'll learn from that. It's a learning thing for us and we'll be better at it next game."

After the Broncos signed Peyton Manning, the Jets and the Jaguars presented similar offers for Tebow, and Tebow was allowed to give his input. One big factor, Tebow said, was that he “had a better relationship” with the Jets coaches, and he knew they wanted him.

At times, the government's own reliance on anonymous sources has caused it considerable grief. When then-Secretary of State Colin L. Powell made the case for invading Iraq at the United Nations in February 2003, he relied in part on four unidentified sources who claimed that Iraq had mobile labs that produced biological weapons. Strong doubt has since been cast on the credibility of all four sources, including one subsequently identified by the appropriate code name "Curveball."

An effective mouth guard holds teeth in place, resists tearing and allows for normal speech and breathing. It should cover the teeth, and depending on the patient's bite, also the gums. An orthodontist can recommend the best mouth guard for an athlete who wears braces. In fact, just by wearing a properly fitted mouth guard, many accidents and traumatic injuries could be prevented. The American Dental Association estimates that mouth guards prevent more than 200,000 oral injuries each year.
District data show that probationary teachers pass evaluations at about the same rate as tenured instructors, despite new instructors' inexperience.

Troy: The Sunday game becomes ripe for rest, particularly for the Rockies. They don't play their first Saturday day game until May 19 vs. the Seattle Mariners at Coors Field.

They may not like government very much, but they are also wary about what capitalism does when the watchdogs fall asleep. They don't cotton to further tax cuts for the wealthy. They reject the idea that worrying about how unequal the rewards in our society have become is the same thing as being "envious" of those who have done well.

As American youth get fatter, an increasing number of would-be recruits are too pudgy to qualify for the military. More than a sixth of U.S. teens are now obese, and many experts predict the number will grow. Already, weight is the main medical reason recruits are rejected for military service, accounting for a quarter of medical failures. That's almost twice the rate of marijuana use, the No. 2 cause of medical failure.
Debates were not an important factor in most voters' decisions. About 34 percent in Michigan and 45 percent in Arizona said debates were an important factor, well off the debate high-point notched in Florida and South Carolina, where more than 6 in 10 called debates leading up to those primaries an important factor in their vote. At the same time there were fewer late-deciders in these two states than in any previous contest measured with an exit poll.

When Griffin, the Trump CEO, lays his head on the pillow at night, he worries that New Jersey will one day succumb to political pressure from lawmakers in the more populous northern part of the state to expand casino gambling to the Meadowlands racetrack, 10 minutes from New York City.

Their arraignment comes more than three years after the Obama administration's failed effort to try the suspects in a federal civilian court and close the prison at the U.S. base in Cuba. Attorney General Eric Holder announced in 2009 that Mohammed and his codefendants would be tried blocks from the site of the destroyed trade center in downtown Manhattan, but the plan was shelved after New York officials cited huge costs to secure the neighborhood and family opposition to trying the suspects in the U.S.

All I can say is that if you want a relaxing, fun and utterly predictable vacation, go to Cancun, Aspen or Disney World. But if you want to encounter a country that makes you think, feel and reflect; if you want a destination that stays with you long after you return; and, most of all, if you want to be a traveler, not just a tourist, see India for yourself.

Both logged time in the kitchens of celebrated New York Italian restaurants before jointly opening Torrisi Italian Specialties in early 2010.

On the field, the Marlins have sputtered out of the gate, going 4-6 through the first week and a half. Reyes has a .238 batting average, a .289 on-base percentage and has scored only four runs through 10 games, while power-hitting Giancarlo Stanton has yet to homer, and No. 1 starter Josh Johnson is pitching to a 8.38 ERA through his first two starts.

She also worked evenings at the family business, Lani Louie's restaurant in Milwaukie, which opened in 1962 and prospered for over 30 years.
For decades, the PRI won every election (by official count, at least). Then, in 2000, voters turned out the party and brought in the PAN. In the last presidential election, in 2006, voters were on the brink of electing the country's first leftist leader, who lost to another PAN candidate, Calderon, by less than 1 percentage point.
It's the right move.
Still, the marriage is perfectly harmonious, Weiss says, with each partner uniquely able to understand the mindset of the other. In fact, Weiss jokes that the only thing that could rock the boat would be Jones taking up one particular new instrument.

More - or less - than a play, Krymov's "Paris" is an exercise in stripping theater to its basics. Sinyakina and five strong actors sing composer Dmitry Volkov's haunting and buoyant chorales, with the chorus providing accompaniment by blowing into bottles and beating on boxes. Cardboard cutout walls or cars revolve to reveal backstage support.

The restaurant's staff is as well seasoned as the food; rarely does a new place have such polished service. The waiter might stumble reciting the tasting menu - the $55 five-course menu changes regularly and is so detailed that the entire spiel is akin to Hamlet's soliloquy - but servers are always there to answer questions and take care of the customers.
A mailbox was busted Monday in the 4800 block of Philadelphia Road.

The French always appreciate passion, to the extent that if you display falling-on-the-floor type passion for a harmless but illegal indiscretion, you're quite likely to get away with it. This man combined his passion with his love for one of their national points of pride, the beaches of the Riveria. I seem to remember him being offered a police escort, and maybe even an Ordre National de la Légion d'Honneur, (National Order of the Legion of Honor) medal.

With paper tickets, for example, the team often has little idea who sits in the arena's seats on a given night. But with e-tickets that are tied to a specific account, the team could note that a particular fan appeared to be most interested in seeing the Warriors play the Lakers, Kings and Spurs -- and then be able to offer ticket packages that are catered to those particular preferences.
Ohio's current two-year budget, which expires June 30, was financed with $8.4 billion in one-time money, much of it Obama administration and congressional "stimulus." So, for the next two years, the governor and the legislature must either scare up $728 from every man, woman and child in Ohio, or hack $8.4 billion from Ohio's budget. That's roughly 17 cents of every $1 Ohio spent in general revenues.

Anderson believes that one of the reasons why Turgeon has been so well-received while Edsall has been widely criticized has not only to do with how their teams performed and the coaches' images portrayed in the media. The men's basketball team finished 17-15, with a 6-10 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference, yet Turgeon is almost revered for his honesty and humility. Edsall is perceived as being evasive and arrogant.

The 2011 flood turned the 1993 study on its head. This year the problem wasn't drought, but an abundance of snow-pack runoff that created the problems. And it wasn't the lower basin, but the reservoir states in the northern Midwest, that suffered the most significant consequences.

The steak sandwich (pronounced hee-bah-ree-to) was dressed with sautéed green bell peppers and onions, shredded lettuce, diced tomato and Swiss cheese. Two savory plantain slices are flattened and fried to form the bread. (Think large, oblong tostones.) The remaining ingredients are layered inside with thinly sliced meat similar to what you typically find in a Philly cheesesteak. The behemoth can be a difficult hand-held meal — especially if you are not used to the texture of the plaintain.

As with any coach in a new role, earning and maintaining respect from the clubhouse. Lilliquist earned points last September during Dave Duncan's leave from the club but now shoulders the unenviable task of officially succeeding 'Dunc' as pitching coach. Lilliquist has been with the organization for a decade. He helped Jaime Garcia's career when Garcia rehabbed from Tommy John surgery. He is not a self-promoter. There will be a transition. Ultimately, the pitchers will answer the question. However, Lilliquist entered camp on solid footing.

Republicans see super PACs as counterweights to President Obama's fundraising advantage as an incumbent. In 2008, Obama angered McCain, his Republican opponent, by breaking his pledge to run within public spending limits. Obama broke his word because money will find a way: He'd tapped millions more through the Internet. This year and last he has chased money relentlessly, raising about $300 million for his campaign and the national party, on his way to a billion. And the presidential election is just the beginning, for supers will also focus on key House and Senate races, which are even more susceptible to being tilted by money. They will join other special interest groups like labor, women's associations, business lobbies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and nonprofit advocacy groups such as the Sierra Club and the National Rifle Association, which have been spending millions.

Madison County, where lawyers for people claiming injuries had long dominated the judicial elections process, made the first few hellhole lists but did not make the cut this year. Instead, it was relegated to second-tier "watch list" status along with the circuit courts in St. Louis, St. Louis County and Jackson County. St. Clair County was in a third tier and described as "another area to watch."

President's Day weekend seemed to be a turning point for gasoline prices, which look to be increasing faster than a speeding bullet. If the trend continues, analysts say, we may see $5 a gallon and beyond. That will put into play some of the measures that made the gas price run-up of 2008 (in June, gas reached $4.62 a gallon) so painful: taxi cab and shuttle service fuel surcharges, hotel energy surcharges and ever higher air fares. Ouch.

So the extension comes with a catch — two of them, really. First, it will gradually shrink the number of weeks a person can receive unemployment benefits nearly in half. Second, it will “pay” for this $30 billion, 10-month extension, in part, by forcing future federal workers to contribute substantially more for their pensions — raising their contributions from 0.8 percent to 2.3 percent of their paychecks.

As a point of illustration, she loads us into her Honda SUV and heads up Holmes Ranch Road into the hills—so that I can actually see the valley. "We get a lot of thunder-bumpers," she says, gesturing toward a brooding bank of clouds in the eastern sky. The climate, says Handley, "has a lot of different personalities when you leave the twisties. It's vivid in personality and climatically when you get to the Yorkville end." She still remembers the intensity of the seasons when she first moved here. "There were spring frosts and fall frosts right before you'd pick. So you can't grow everything here." Over the years, through trial and error, farmers and winemakers began to learn what worked in a region that seemed not just obstinate but merciless: Gewürztraminer, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, they found, grow well here. As do Rieslings. "They excel with personality on the deep end of the valley—lemony, apple and a mineral quality," she says. "That's because of the cold nights." Along with local varietals, she reels off the names of some of the valley's eminent residents past and present: a former Playboy Bunny, writer Alice Walker and Kary Mullis, who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the polymerase chain reaction—a.k.a. DNA "fingerprinting." "He was driving down 128 when he figured it out!" she says.

Finally, Mr. Zwald states unequivocally but falsely, "Societies everywhere reject same-sex marriage. How are we so smart to overrule what people everywhere else know?"

For example, as faculty and students in the Health and Human Rights Clinic at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, we represent a client who is legally blind and whose wife is disabled. On paper, they do not present as one of the 53 million Americans who are without health insurance, since they qualify for the Medicare and Medicaid government programs. But Indiana officials have erected a daunting barrier between them and any possible Medicaid support for the prescriptions they need to fill. Our state's regulations require this couple to first "spend down" their income to well below subsistence level by incurring several hundred dollars each month in medical bills. When they cannot do that, which is often, they do not get Medicaid help and must go without the care their doctor has prescribed. The consequences of not taking the medication they cannot afford include severe pain, swelling and complications that have on occasion forced them to be hospitalized.
