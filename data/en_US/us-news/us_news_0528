What changed: Again, maybe the entire game if either Harbaugh gets the timeout off, Smith puts that ball in a different spot for Crabtree, or Crabtree makes a move upfield to get the extra two yards. At this point, the 49ers were trailing by three, 17-14, and were finally rolling after an excellent return from the embattled Kyle Williams. But the Giants defense held strong, forcing Smith into a throw he looked like he didn’t want. Meanwhile, Harbaugh was darting off the sideline signaling for a timeout. Remember, a touchdown there puts the Giants down four and with the way the 49ers defense was playing in the second half, it would be tough sledding for Manning and Co. to answer back.

In a Tuesday forecast, the federal Energy Information Administration predicted prices will average $3.95 a gallon through September and could peak at $4.01 in May. But those estimates reflect crude oil at $110 a barrel. EIA is forecasting a bit of a break in 2013 prices - $3.73 a gallon.

Bigger wafers will require new manufacturing tools and substantial up-front costs to develop those tools. A decade ago, when the industry shifted to the current 300 millimeter standard, a difficult and prolonged transition cost suppliers billions.
With all costs considered, we both agree that it's time for the Honda to go. Gerry has started looking through classified ads to get a feel for what a replacement car might cost. He's not looking for anything flashy, but used-car values have dropped so much that he's willing to consider pricier models. We'll shop and compare, and, with a bit of luck, find a luxury car that we can actually afford.

It’s just one of the profound changes that playwright Marina Carr has made to “Hippolytus,” the Greek tragedy that Euripides wrote more than 400 years before Christ lived. The story of a wife who falls in love with her husband’s son from another union later attracted Roman playwright Seneca the Younger, who titled his tragedy “Phaedra.” French dramatist Racine adapted it, too, in 1677.

Mr. Eksteins has a knack for pinpointing moments in the rise of Modernism that expose the deep social forces that have shaped our world. His pathbreaking "Rites of Spring" (1989) argued that radical artistic experiments like Stravinsky's infamous ballet "The Rite of Spring" were a defining part of the political and psychological crises that precipitated World War I. Now he sets out to show that Van Gogh's pervasive hold on 20th-century culture has little to do with the early Modernists of fin de siècle France, where his brief career played out. Instead, Mr. Eksteins provocatively argues, Van Gogh's prevalence can be traced to the cultural anxieties of 1920s Germany, where his art first gained wide notoriety—and where a major controversy over fakes erupted.

It turns out, however, that some of the added income wireless carriers get from data plans is just compensating for a drop in what they're able to charge for calling minutes.

After his election, instead of living in posh, mayorly quarters, he continued to live in one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city to better stay connected with the people. During a 2010 blizzard that paralyzed the city, Booker grabbed a shovel and got to work. And when late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien began taking potshots at Newark, Booker turned the joke back on O'Brien, banning him from using Newark Liberty International Airport and demanding a public apology. The running "feud" ended when Booker made an appearance on the show to patch things up.

As for "Terra Nova," this is a Big Production, as you'd expect with Steven Spielberg's name in the credits (he's an executive producer). The pilot has echoes of big-screen ancestors, including "Blade Runner," "Avatar" and "Jurassic Park." The premise: Earth in the year 2149 is bleak, its resources exhausted, its surface choked with overpopulation. The only hope: send people back in time to the good old primeval days, where they can take a second run at this whole establishing a civilization thing.

Your mission is to build a base, defend it and conquer your foes. To do so you'll need resources: crystal, gas, energy and uranium - which you can mine on your base - or platinum, which you can buy for real money.

Compare that with Shepherd's Hope, which provides literally lifesaving help to thousands of families every year — largely because it watches every dime and relies on good will and hard work, rather than scores of high-paid execs, to get things done.

Epstein just arrived. He's wrapping up his first week on the job in a cramped, decaying office at Clark and Addison, and we've seen no real change. For all of his talk at the news conference and press stops, he really hasn't said anything of substance. His new partners - executive vice president and general manager Jed Hoyer and senior vice president for scouting and player development Jason McLeod - were announced late Wednesday and will be formally introduced in the next few days.
If the first televised debate -- the 1960 affair in which a tan Kennedy waxed the wan Nixon -- was a wrinkle in time, the 2012 reruns are an unsightly age spot. While the tepid format might expose Texas Gov. Rick Perry's inability to remember the three federal agencies he would eliminate, it typically provides cover for the candidates, and voters, who would rather traffic in soundbites than solutions.

The Register posted 5% of all employees who make over the arbitrary number of $100,000 and created the exact uninformed buzz they anticipated. The reporters can't even explain the purpose of their story so why should we? People are saying that they won't vote for more teachers raises. You don't vote now. Who are you? Management and the teachers' associations negotiate salaries and Boards of Education have the final say. Local control determines what a district is willing to commit to salaries. You don't have to like it. Perhaps some people would like to forgo local control for a State program and a uniform salary schedule. Some districts pay better than others. That is why they attract potentially stronger candidates. I'm sure it's not always the case. Is competition only OK for the private sector? Do we have to fixate on the worst teachers with big salaries and pay no attention to the big picture?

He could read the Serbian case as grounds to side with the archdiocese's view. Under that thinking, a civil court considering church disputes should always defer to the internal legal rulings of that church's hierarchy. Such a reading of the law could return control of St. Stanislaus and its property to the archdiocese - overruling the parish's claim to independence.
I'm the new reporter covering Beaverton and the Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District. Last week, I moved to the area after a 12-hour road trip from California. I had heard that if there's one thing that people here enjoy beside their beer, it's the local coffee.

The first of the two-day New Zealand in L.A. festival at REDCAT on Wednesday night featured eight chamber and solo works by Kiwi composers, none with much of an international reputation, and a renowned performer on Maori instruments, Richard Nunns.

You sound like a master couponer, so I would just keep on doing what you're doing. — Margo, generously

But the timing of this award is vitally important. Realistically, how many more times can we look forward to being blessed by seeing Musial on the stage, smiling?

The back-and-forth between Robert Downey Jr.'s glib Iron Man and Chris Evans' old-school Captain America is electric, while Downey's more low-key, philosophical exchanges with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk help give the film some intellectual heft.
