I was there in 2000 when then-Microsoft CEO Bill Gates showed off what a press release described as "a prototype Tablet PC -- weighing less than three pounds and small enough to fit in one hand." Aside from weight (the new iPad weighs 1.44 pounds), the main difference between Microsoft's attempt to shoehorn Windows onto a tablet and Apple's elegant iPad implementation is that Apple understood that a new form factor required new software, which is ironic considering that Apple's heritage is as a PC maker while Microsoft's DNA is in software.

A: Some will hold the Ohio State administration responsible for how this played out, starting with the uncomfortable news conference to announce Tressel's sanctions on March 8. Smith and Gee didn't have to show Tressel such unwavering support on that night, and with their comments, they certainly tied themselves to their coach in some ways.
Jack is glad to be back after some disappointing scores last week. His most memorable year is last year (2011) and he gets choked up before he even starts to tell the story. Last year he was about to go onstage for a concert and a young girl came running up to him, grabbed him, and announced she was his daughter. Now we see the daughter in an interview, but neither one of them are explaining exactly why she was so "long-lost." They're dancing the samba to Jack's own "Light Up the Night," and Jack starts out atop the judges' table with a guitar. Oh, dear -- that's gotta be a top 10 most awkward pelvic thrust on this show. And I've watched every season. I'm not sure it's great technically, but I'm giving Jack an A+ for effort and sportsmanship. He runs over to hug the long-lost daughter before judging. Len liked the rhythm but said the upper body was awkward. He compliments Anna on the choreography. Bruno also compliments his rhythm and likes his timing as well. Carrie Ann was crying during the interview package and says she wants to see more of Jack with the improvement in his dancing. And now Jack's crying while talking to Brooke Burke-Charvet.

Not asked to be the key to winning games, and rather be an intelligent operator of the offense, Smith has led the 49ers with efficiency, not explosiveness. He's thrown just five interceptions, fewest in the NFC, and his passer rating of 91.1 is on pace to be a career high.

As my prom approaches in May, I've finally started the preparations. I've been avidly looking for my dream dress, and organizing the group for a limo.

More than 100 people packed the district board room for the meeting, many of them opposed to the district's plans for Charter Square.

If your body can't process food because of a terminal illness, forcing nutrition in will not prolong life. Decreased appetite and thirst is a natural part of dying.

Wines 14 percent or less in alcohol are "table wines" under federal law. They have a latitude of 1.5 percent in listed alcohol - a flexibility largely born out of the prospect that a 12.5 percent table wine could range from 11 to 14 percent. That range, frequently seen on imported wines from the 1960s and '70s, can still be used.

But this is about much more than money. It is about survival and, for those who make it, quality of life. While all eight of the Bellflower infants were listed in "stable" condition, two were placed on ventilators because of breathing problems. And a "stable" diagnosis guarantees next to nothing in terms of how they will be faring tomorrow, or five or 10 years hence. Premature babies account for more than half of all infants who do not survive the first year of life. Those who do survive often encounter problems ranging from blindness and feedingproblems to cerebral palsy and long-term developmental disabilities.
Yeah, we know. This is the second time in less than four months that we've come up with a crazy idea to mix music and sports. But unlike our tongue-in-cheek plea to get Weird Al Yankovic onto next year's Super Bowl halftime stage, this is something that we actually believe has a chance.

The 1960s were a trying time for Paul. His marriage ended in divorce in 1964 (Ford died in 1977). Popular musical tastes were changing: in the rock era, his clean-cut approach to pop seemed out-dated.

Sheen, as has been his pattern of late, was not hesitant to fire back.
Davis' approach is dense, encyclopedic, his writerly method perhaps mirroring the obsession that the climbers came to feel. He gives vivid accounts of both the war and the earlier survey of India that led to the naming of Everest, an almost hidden peak, and established that it was indeed the highest point on Earth. He shows the patriotic ache that sent these men to the top of the world, as if trying to fill a void they knew in their hearts could never again be filled. Why do you want to climb Everest? Mallory was asked. "Because it's there," was his famously laconic reply. So engines of diplomacy were engaged, sponsorships sought, the wildly ambitious yet almost quixotic expeditions launched.
Eliot Coleman is the Pied Piper of the organic, local food movement. In 1968, he and his young wife went to visit Helen and Scott Nearing on their farm in Maine. The Nearings had left New York City in 1932, themselves pioneers in an alternative, rural lifestyle that drew thousands of visitors and became the subject of many articles and books about trading Western materialism for self-sufficiency. The Colemans settled on 60 acres next door to the Nearings, built a house (without electricity or running water and heated by wood) and had three children. Melissa, the author of this memoir and the oldest, remembers the Nearings, the long winters, the delicious food her parents raised and her mother's battle with depression. But the event that draws all other memories down into the well is the drowning of her 3-year-old sister when Melissa was 6. This memory puts all others in question — were the Colemans and the Nearings and others like them focused on the wrong things? Distracted by their ideology?

Lately, as I leave and wait at the light, I have been counting the cars coming off 85 and observing how many are in them. Out of 70 cars, one had two passengers and all the others had only the driver. I have been counting for more than two weeks now. Same with Shoreline -- 50 cars, with only one having two passengers. I did notice some relief during spring break.

However, the Sun is not a quiet object like a bar magnet. It’s rotating, about once a month. Moreover, different parts of it move at different speeds. A spot on the equator goes around in 26 days; a spot near the Sun’s North Pole would require 38 days to circle it.
TRENTON -- A study of the Massachusetts tax cap held up as the solution for New Jersey's escalating property tax woes said educational standards can stay strong even while governments spends less on students. The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research study released today found the cap, which limits property taxes to 2.5 percent annual increases unless voters approve higher spending, helped Massachusetts towns slow the growth of property-tax increases without forcing other taxes to rise to keep up.

As city leaders encourage people to live, visit, shop and walk their dogs after business hours downtown, they send the wrong message by closing a prominent gathering spot at the start of the evening. If the biggest issue is the darkness of the park, then perhaps the city could judiciously install some lights without compromising its appearance. But the hours for City Hall's park should not be rolled back. They should remain as they were.
The new building, a former World of Denim store, boasts about 9,000 square feet of exhibit space. The previous location, a storefront in the Osceola Square Mall, had about 2,000 square feet. Many items that used to be in storage can now be displayed.

The openness of that — the 'oh yeah, that's the way things are done' attitude — was the most shocking."
Through surveys like Pew's, we also know what will happen in the decades that follow the widespread legalization of same-sex marriage: An issue that divides Americans as intensely as any in our ongoing culture wars will simply cease to matter, as conservatives discover their own marriages are in no way devalued. Today, according to Pew, 63% of Americans say they "would be fine" if a family member opted to marry someone outside his or her racial or ethnic group, and the overall percentage of interracial marriages is soaring: It hit 15.1% nationwide in 2010 and is even higher in California, where the majority of such unions are between whites and Latinos.

Scholars can't say whether either problem is getting more severe or just more widely reported because no data show what percentage of gay youths or bullying victims are suicidal. Most of the nation's 34,000 suicides a year don't get coverage.
His voice is slang-y, profane, defensive. His attitude is condescending toward authority and remorseless as an aggressor. In therapy, Butterball thinks the doctor is "stupid," "skinny" and has "zero taste." Beating up the boy he once considered a friend felt good, he admitted. It was the rare time he'd felt respect from his peers — or gotten much attention from his parents.
"Our experience is people can be immediately hooked," Spike Figgett, publishing director of Sudoku Selection magazine, told the Orlando Sentinel.

He canceled the F-22 Raptor fighter program, the C-17 cargo plane, the Zumwalt destroyer and the Marines' Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle and imposed cuts in the force size of the Army and Marines.

And no wonder it's popular: The Blue Lagoon is like nothing else I'd ever seen, nearly two square miles of meandering, landscaped pool with rocky coves, wooden bridges crossing inlets and benches for sitting and soaking. People float around blissfully with their faces covered in white silica mud ladled from pots around the pool. (It's supposed to work wonders on the complexion.) My favorite moment was standing under the artificial waterfall, which rained hot water on my neck and shoulders for a thoroughly relaxing massage.

While the initial lycopene research looked really promising, the vital follow-up studies on prostate cancer haven't panned out. At best, the results are mixed. Same goes for lycopene fighting prostate cancer if you already have it (glad you don't!). The data just aren't there. Does that mean you should stop eating marinara sauce (over whole-wheat pasta, of course!)? Nope. It may be a combo of nutrients in cooked tomatoes, including lycopene, that's protective. But lycopene alone isn't a silver bullet.
NEW YORK: The Titanic never arrived in New York, but many New Yorkers were onboard and are buried here - both those who survived as well as those who perished.

Look at the Gators’ losses and you’ll see three respectable scores against some of the top teams in the league. Look at their wins and you’ll see dominance. Reservoir has a Division I prospect at quarterback, size on the lines, and talent on offense and defense. Like a Gator in a swamp, they’re just waiting for a higher-ranked team — Glenelg (Oct. 14), Howard (Oct. 28) or Wilde Lake (Nov. 4) — to walk by so they can strike.
A Quinnipiac poll last week found that by a 51-38 percent margin, Florida voters want the Supreme Court to overturn the health care law.
Desserts have to be really good to be worth $11. What I had didn't measure up, or maybe I was just disappointed that the chocolate and peanut butter sandwich was really like a chocolate-covered mousse with very little nut flavor, arranged on an unfortunate swipe of chocolate, with three small fried chocolate croquettes and a pleasant malted chocolate milk shake. The walnut cake resembled a mini Bundt cake, with a mascarpone mousse and a seasonal fruit relish heavy on persimmon. It tasted fine, though it wasn't nearly as memorable as the price.

Like fiction films, the best documentaries are driven by character, setting and plot. The story that's told in the Oscar-winning heart-tugger "Undefeated" is inherently dramatic, as an underfunded football team in inner-city Memphis makes an improbable run toward the state playoffs. And the central character is a classic motivator who teaches the kids to believe in themselves. But without a broader vision of the playing field, a potential touchdown is stopped just short of the goal line.

You can also sign on to a shark excursion (www.apexpredators.com) from Simon's Town, about 45 minutes from Cape Town.
What's driving this insiders' insurrection?

“Higher energy prices would probably slow growth, at least in the short run,” Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said March 21.

The Ohio House acted last June. The Senate passed its resolution in January, as President Obama announced he was putting the project on hold by extending the deadline one year to rule on a permit for pipeline operator TransCanada.
Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle is a true wild card here. He's smart. Better yet, he understands he doesn't have all the answers, and like great leaders, surrounds himself with capable, smart people. He even brought in former Blazer assistant Tim Grgurich to consult. Also, Mavericks stars Jason Kidd and Dirk Nowitzki are older, but capable of carrying their team. So this won't be easy.

In fact, while about 50 percent of children born to straight parents are considered accidental, all homosexual couples have to fight to have children, demonstrating their dedication to being good parents.

My opinion: I'm starting to like Rousseff. I wish Brazil would extend its fledgling human rights sensitivity to causes closer to home, such as fundamental freedoms in Cuba, or that Rousseff would say a few things publicly about Venezuela when Chavez visits her this week, but I am under no illusion that she will. All countries have double standards when it comes to human rights and their economic interests, including the United States, which treats allies such as Saudi Arabia less harshly than adversaries like Iran.

Two words we use to praise skill are "dexterous," from the Latin dexter, "right," and "adroit", from the French a droit, "to the right." On the other hand (the left one, of course), sinistra, Latin for "left hand," yields the pejorative "sinister" in English.

A great way to buy local is at farmers markets, which these days can be found almost everywhere. Some grocery stores also sell local produce. Note: Don't be deterred if local farmers don't label their produce "organic." They may use organic methods but may not be able to afford the high cost of certification. Many such farmers use the term "sustainable" to describe low-impact methods they use to raise produce. The great thing about farmers markets is that you can usually ask the farmer directly how they raise what they're selling.

I know that. If you go out and spend time with them and you actually talk to them and look at them you can actually see it. They've become emotionally invested in this and in a lot of cases it's very hard to get them to break away. They're focused on the child — it's become a focal point for them. They want this resolved. ... I actually have to order these people to go home. I have to find a replacement and tell them they've got to go home because they just refuse to do that."
