Inevitable comparisons to Nirvana might have prompted his initial defensiveness. Nowadays, it surely irks him that every Foo Fighters album is called the band’s best since "The Colour and the Shape," the 1997 set that made it clear Grohl had a career in the spotlight ahead of him. "Wasting Light," the latest Foo Fighters album, isn’t the band’s best since "The Colour and the Shape"; it’s the band’s best, period. And while it has helped to have fellow grunge survivor and original Foo guitarist Pat Smear (who also played with Nirvana) back in the fold after more than a decade, there’s a simpler reason for its excellence: Grohl’s writing has never been sharper.

Given that there are already almost 10,000 religions in the world, Jewish author Eric Weiner writes that we need to "invent not a new religion but, rather, a new way of being religious." As the dean of a theology school, I see the Emerging Church attracting an incredible diversity of people into new and experimental kinds of religious community. The lapsed faithful, exhausted refugees from mainline faiths, former evangelicals, frustrated Catholics and seekers with no background at all in organized religion are creating (in Weiner's beautiful phrase) "a religious space that celebrates doubt, encourages experimentation and allows one to utter the word God without embarrassment."

True, Americans sometimes have made great sacrifices in blood and treasure to make the world safe for democracy -- from the Western Front in 1918 to the mountains of Afghanistan today -- and the Marshall Plan still is regarded as what Churchill called "the most unsordid act in history."

We wander around the small piazza, peeking over the wall into somebody's tomato garden, then head back down into the town square, which has a burbling fountain and Christmas lights strung up, even though it's July. There's a group of men playing Scopa, a Sicilian card game that involves slapping random cards onto the table - and making as much noise as possible - and lots of Italian ladies dressed up in glittery clothes.

Close to 100 residents in Delaware County are HIV-positive. The numbers have remained stagnant in recent years, but the increase of sexually transmitted diseases and infections -- the county saw a 25-percent rise in STDs/STIs in a one-year period, according to the County Health Rankings -- has health advocates concerned that residents are not practicing safe sex.
A: I was born in Grants Pass and grew up in Ashland. We also spent about eight years in Applegate, where my family owned a little country store. That was an amazing time, lots of lazy summer days, floating down the Applegate River on inner tubes. In many ways, it was absurd because we had no business being out in the country because we were extremely soft! I graduated from Hidden Valley High School.

LZ Granderson, ESPN.com: "Like the Super Bowl, March Madness has moved beyond the realm of sports and become an integral part of our culture. References can be heard in our music and scripted dialogue on TV. Industries that are not directly related to basketball -- such as furniture companies -- tie their marketing to the tournament. For some restaurants and bars, it's the biggest time of the year. Considering the level of national interest for the men's NCAA tournament, it would only make sense that we make the days of the round of 64 -- two business days at the end of an early week in March -- national holidays."

But rulers in Mr. Putin's shoes are loath to give up power, not least because of fear their successors will turn on them. Monarchs aside, recent history offers relatively few examples of embattled autocrats who manage to die peacefully in office or step down gracefully. Consider the misfortunes of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak (now on trial) and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi (dead) in last year's Arab Spring, and the way other strongmen, from Angola to Syria, took note and dug in.

I remembered to bring my ticket and pictures of my kids, but knew there was something I'd neglected to do. When I got there it hit me: I'd forgotten to lose 20 pounds. I had also forgotten what L.A. traffic was like, so I was late. Luckily, my tardiness helped my old classmates recognize me. So did the big zit on my face.
Brenda Escobar said she avoids placing holds on the popular books -- "where you're around 400-something." She recently picked up "The Purity Myth," a book about "America's obsession with virginity," and waited a couple of weeks for the hold to come through.

It has 15 tracks, including new songs, covers and pensive spoken-word segments that are meant to tie everything together. Yet it all clocks in at under a half-hour. So, though it offers glimpses of the demons that have driven and, at times, destroyed Scott-Heron, it doesn’t explore them in any depth. The “On Coming from a Broken Home” segments that open and close the album may ground it in reality, but the tracks in between are often frustratingly abstract.
Masterson, pitching for a team so offensively challenged that he has only an 8-7 record despite a 2.56 ERA, is as miserly with the runs as Sabathia, who is 15-5. CC, apparently standing for "Copious Clouts," has benefited from a Yankee lineup that five times has scored 12 or more runs for him.
Each letter came with an RSVP code that, when submitted online, immediately cancels that member's card. Members have from March 1 to April 30 to pay off their balances and receive the prepaid card.

The late '60s were marked by increasing rebellion against police raids of gay bars, most notably Stonewall in New York in 1969. A few years before that, Compton Cafeteria in the Tenderloin had its own riots over police arrests.

In La'ie, it is not easy to locate a shot of booze or even espresso; Mormons frown on stimulants like alcohol and caffeine. But just down the road is a Catholic church where sips of alcohol are served for free in the most holy rite of the faith. In one religion, wine is frowned upon; in another, it is a sacrament.
In the eighth, with Sergio Romo pitching, third baseman Joaquin Arias made one of the Giants' best defensive plays of the season, backhanding a Ryan Roberts bad-hop smash up the third-base line that would have made it a 4-3 game and kept the inning alive had it gone through.

In fact, she's peeved at Osbourne, who sits in judgment of celebrity style on "Fashion Police" for recently saying Love looked like a crackhead. So Love tells the website about how she helped Kimberly Stewart (Rod's daughter) clean up after Osbourne one time: "I reached into her massive boobs and I pulled out a tennis ball filled with a substantial amount of blow and 80 milligrams of Oxy. I tried to flush everything down the toilet. But there was a person there who begged me to keep the drugs so we could use them later. I was like, "No, no, the drugs must be flushed! The West Hollywood sheriff is outside.' "

For example, I had to try the Sea Breeze salad ($13), touted on the menu as a neighborhood favorite. It's a humungous salad with all the right ingredients -- seared ahi, potatoes, hard-boiled egg and feta -- but the tuna was over-seared and under-seasoned, and the balsamic dressing lacked zing. Another fish dish, the orange roughy ($16), suffered a similar fate -- it simply lacked spark.

A court spokesperson confirmed this is what Andler saw.

"Any little one thing could be the issue that turns Nevada one way or the other," said James Smack, a Republican National Committee member.

The newly updated iPad isn't a revolutionary device like the original, but it's still likely to be a hit with consumers.

From the hot plates came grits with a savory depth, meaty black-eyed peas, regal greens. Among meats, there was one serviceable sliced roast beef offering along with three chicken dishes.

Americans were tricked into a costly war with Iraq, and we're still bogged down in God-forsaken Afghanistan. Our extra-Constitutional military action in Libya was unacceptable, and the U.S. "global police force" is obscene. When will the American people have the guts to say "Enough!"
The key, of course, is understanding that there's no such thing as an average New Yorker. Our common bond is that we all have opposing interests, different tastes, and strong opinions. So how do you please us? By offering an unusually broad mix, carefully culled by experienced programmers like Geoff Gilmore (formerly of Sundance), Nancy Schafer (SXSW) and Frédéric Boyer (Cannes).
“His thing was, ‘I won without you.’ He’s an arrogant guy, he thinks he’s right and everyone else is wrong,” Bloomingdale said. “Calling him a labor supporter would be similar to calling Mitt Romney a conservative. They’re both ridiculous.”

Kelley, playing for the Fighting Ducks, scored on a 28-yard reception from quarterback Bryan Bennett.
Kemery assured us that her way involved no sanding, stripping or priming, and it works on wood, metal and plastic. The magic comes from a jar -- specifically, jars of Country Living products, available at caromalcolours.com/store.php. Kemery started by applying a texture base coat that was as thick as peanut butter to a small wooden chest. She stuck a miniroller right in the jar and spread it on the chest. Then she used something called chipping cream alternating with layers of paint.
Democrats could bring a lawsuit challenging the newly drawn map under an equal protection clause for how the map "packs" Democrats into the majority districts, Redfern said.
Most of the 17 elections in Africa last year wound up being disputed. Nigeria's vote saw rioting and sectarian killings, although international observers called it relatively free and fair. Ivory Coast's2010 presidential election led to civil warfare before incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo was hauled out of an underground bunker, arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court, where he faces trial on charges of crimes against humanity.

Oregon has recruited well, but the UO coaches also have developed the players they recruited. It’s part of an overall philosophy, which hinges on the rapid pace with which Oregon plays and practices, and the number of fresh bodies it takes to do it that way.

"The best part for me with David is that he cuts to the chase," Hitchcock said. "So, if it's a message coming from the coaches, or a message that needs to be delivered inside the locker room, we don't go through the dance where the political correctness has to take place - 'How is this guy going to take it, or how is that guy going to feel about it?'

It is, rather, that ours is a nation so obscenely comfortable in conflating black with crime that a civilian carrying no badge of authority nevertheless feels it his right to require that an American boy walking lawfully upon a public street justify his presence there. And it is the knowledge that at least some black men would have done the same.

Golden State closes the lockout shortened campaign 23-43, having lost 22 of its last 27 games.
It is just stuff-stuff that will eventually rot and rust, stuff that will be consumed by moths or stolen by thieves. At least that is how Jesus describes the treasures we accumulate on earth in Matthew 6. Jesus suggests that accumulating stuff is quite the opposite of grateful living. Living in gratitude frees us from stuff, opening us to God's way. Our stuff weighs us down, forcing us to choose between trusting in God's abundant provision and the anxious belief that says we have to have it all. Whatever you call treasure, says Jesus, reveals your primary allegiance in life.

Judge Hudson's ruling is a reminder that the mandate issue remains unresolved. The coming Congress could -- if Republicans can put aside their antipathy for every aspect of what they call Obamacare and if Democrats are open-minded to its flaws -- work with the administration to refine a plan that really might provide access to quality care for all Americans while also controlling costs. Much work toward that goal has been done, but much also remains if both parties are serious.
Almost three years after the DNA mismatch was revealed — and after Hobbs had spent nearly five years in jail — the FBI's DNA database revealed a link between the semen and former Marine Jorge Torrez, a Zion native and close friend of Krystal Tobias' brother, according to court records.

Dark-of-night dealmaking and misbehaving members are traditions as old as government itself, the price of putting ambitious human beings in positions of power and showering them with privileges unknown to most people they govern. "There must be some sort of greed virus that attacks those in power," U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III said in November when sentencing former Democratic Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana to 13 years in prison for taking bribes. The judge called public corruption "a cancer on the body politic."

A decade after the fall of the Soviet Union, the global military supremacy of the United States was unquestioned. So was its economic dominance, despite a lingering hangover from the sudden end of the dot-com era. Washington's financial house was in order: The federal government had a budget surplus, and despite a substantial tax cut passed that summer, many economists believed the books would stay balanced if spending were held in check.

The Missoni collection was an attempt by Target to regain the cache it lost among the fashion-forward crowd after it began focusing on expanding its food business. Target is among a few retailers who have partnered with high-end designers that create exclusive lines they can offer for a limited time at deep discounts. The collections can spur demand by creating a sense of urgency to buy. Last year, Target scored big with a line created by Liberty of London, offering 300 items with the designer, which is known for its floral prints, and selling out of most of it in a couple of days.

øGovernments can also manipulate the market price of gold, by buying or selling it on the open market. One of the first Black Fridays in Wall Street history occurred in 1869 when robber barons Jay Gould and Jim Fisk tried to corner gold - that is, buy so much of it that they could dictate the price. The government sold $4 million in gold to break the corner, ruining speculators who had gone along for the ride. (Gould and Fisk managed to come out with few losses.)

In some places he's treated more as a prophet than a musician.

The Freep's Olympic notebook is playing catch-up this week. Here are a few items of local interest from the world of international sports that have been hanging out on my yellow pad -- and my inbox -- and are too noteworthy not to pass along:
The formality is that the U.S. beat Costa Rica 3-0 Friday night to earn a ticket to London. The game was quite a bit more suspenseful than expected, with the Americans overcoming some early sloppiness and waiting until deep into the second half to put the game away.
Why it's cool: This course was purpose-built to host a PGA Tour event yet it's owned by the city. For sheer mania, its No. 16, a short par 3. During the Phoenix Open, the entire hole is ringed in bleachers, skyboxes and as many as 20,000 folks who will greet any tee shot not hit to their collective satisfaction like the Dodgers entering San Francisco's AT&T Park — cubed. As with No. 17 at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., most pros start thinking about 16 while driving to the course.
"The biggest thing for me is I have children who are the same age as most of our players, so I see things from a different level," Sutter said. "And other things in life become … I mean, I played, I was a captain … But it's what you do, it's not who you are."
Sometimes I write about what I'm doing or try to do sketches to solve the problem, but I find not thinking about the problem is more successful. Walks are good.

"I get along with so many people," Kasemeyer said. "I think people trust me, and that's a wonderful thing. That's all you have here really. I've been able to create that."
After strutting their stuff at Westminster — widely regarded as the ultimate beauty pageant for dogs — most winners get to take it easy. Owners of New Jersey’s recent canine champs say their dogs lend their charm to nursing homes and hospitals, but the rest of the time, they kick back and enjoy their retirement.
The scandal emerged last month after an employee of GMAC Mortgage admitted to falsifying documents. Bank of America, Chase and PNC joined GMAC to halt foreclosures in 23 states including Ohio that require court approval to foreclose on a property. The banks say they're reviewing paperwork to ensure everything was done properly.
You even expect a band to jump out of a stall and start playing in the bathroom.
“That lifetime of loving was erased by the days and weeks and months in the failure to provide the very basics of what a parent is required to do,” he said.
The story credits Patterson for the vision to launch his company more than three decades ago and for driving its success. It also notes an infamous memo he wrote in 2001 roasting his managers for not pushing the Cerner workforce to put in longer hours.

“My wife and I were down there just the other day. We had gone down the boat launch ramp and I was commenting that the campground right there is so cool,” Wheeler said. “It’s a tragedy that someone died. But, do trees fall over? Yes, they’re trees. They fall over. Go camp in a cornfield if you don’t want to have trees.”
He said the focus on the three has changed everything about basketball. Why spend time working on passing, dribbling or defense when you can stake out a spot 20 feet from the hoop and fire away?
Here's a new iPad feature, but a familiar one: speech to text. You can tap the onscreen keyboard's new microphone button and just say what you want to type.
Trump's comments weren't the subject of a single news story in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch during the week surveyed by the News Coverage Index. But his potential candidacy was featured or mentioned in five commentaries on the Other Views page. (For newspapers, the New Coverage Index only includes news stories that start on the front page.)
Q Let's talk about that culinary background ...
For Fortner, college meant college softball. That was obvious. She is an outstanding student - she has a 4.0 GPA - but softball was her ticket to college. She was one of the metro area's standout talents.
Said Turgeon in a news release: “He’s a stretch power forward who can really shoot the ball. He has a good feel for the game. He played a lot of minutes on a Big Ten championship team. Evan is a matchup nightmare at his position. He’s a great kid and really wants to be at Maryland. He’s another great piece to what we’re trying to put together here.”
The state Legislature can talk all the trash it wants about supporting education and setting high standards. It will never happen until the culture of this county — and all of Florida, for that matter — changes dramatically.

How does one violent death captivate a nation, while the violent passing of so many others is met with indifference?
"This rescue operation has been so marvelous, so clean, so emotional that there was no reason not to allow the eyes of the world — which have been watching this operation so closely — to see it," a a beaming Pinera told a news conference after the first miner safely surfaced.

Operating on a tip from Jerry Talkington and directions from the Bobolink Rare Bird Alert, 1-330-763-5119, we made our way to the Joseph Miller farm near the village of Fredricksburg.

Lisa Delp, an entrepreneurship expert for the Ohio Department of Development, said the results could create jobs that stay.
But in Australia, where polls show that most people support gay marriage, the left-leaning Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she remains opposed, and three bills in Parliament that would allow same-sex couples to marry are unlikely to pass.

The independence granted to us 235 years ago by the bold declaration of our nation's founding fathers certainly is reason to celebrate, and fireworks have long been a Fourth of July tradition.

The only location the commission suggested should close was the Department of Children and Family Services office in Skokie.
øYoung obsessives: "When I was a kid, I was obsessed with vampires," Pfeiffer told reporters. I went to every Dracula movie. I would spring home from the bus stop to get home to get in front of the television to watch Dark Shadows because it came on in the afternoon." Heathcote came more from the Joss Whedon school of the undead. "I watched Buffy," she said.
President Barack Obama spoke out about the Martin tragedy, saying on Friday, the same day as the LeBron tweet, "I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this.

One Western official in Europe who is familiar with the intelligence said one suspected plot involved teams of gunmen equipped with small arms who hoped to mount commando-style raids in Europe. A senior French official said France was focused mainly on a separate threat from al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, a North African group that is linked to, but operates separately from, al-Qaida itself.
Property records indicate that two condominiums, both in Mount Laurel, were purchased in July 2005 — one by Lewis and one by a family trust. He bought another home in Medford in November 2007.
Less is more: Another tidbit about the Bobcats. While through two tournament games they are averaging four points below their Mid-American Conference regular-season scoring average (67.7 ppg), they are shooting better from the field (45 percent-43 percent), better on 3-pointers (44 percent-34 percent) and better from the free-throw line (81 percent/69 percent).
We believe the days of business as usual must come to an end. We hold to a couple of simple convictions: Endless borrowing is not a strategy; spending cuts have to come first.
His latest television commercial, in fact, is titled, “Angry.” It features Strickland squinting and clenching his jaw as he vents to workers that he, too, is frustrated by the economy. While the spot – and his speech today – acknowledges the tough times voters are facing, it is meant to redirect blame from incumbents to people like Kasich, a former managing partner at the failed Lehman Brothers investment bank. The firm’s collapse in September 2008 helped fuel the national financial crisis.
"This time last year, less than half of the industry was controlled by independents," said Roger Ihne, a Mid-Americas portfolio leader with Deloitte & Touche. "By the end of this year, over 70 percent of the refinery capacity will be held by independent refineries."

"When I landed hard I had a shock of pain and my ears were ringing," he added.
That earns the movie points. So does Vardalos’ long-held, laudable refusal to stoop to dirty jokes (even when we see the internet “porn” that Roberts’ husband constantly surfs, it’s merely women in bikinis). And hats off to Hanks’ own urge to do something uplifting (he described the movie to Entertainment Weekly magazine as “a fight against cynicism”).
But others felt stung.
The cities and neighborhoods spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases millions, to get the word out. That's beyond the millions already shelled out by county convention and visitors bureaus.
Mayleben was the most active of the three, running the court, going after rebounds and defending. But his lack of bulk especially in the upper body needs to be addressed. Wrencher did not touch the ball nearly as much as the other two. But like Mayleben, he ran the court well, and definitely went after more rebounds than Johnson.
It's a disservice not to hold children to certain standards, based on their own capabilities. I'm lucky to have smart kids, so we can push them when it comes to homework and getting good grades. But it's sort of weird how overemphasized preparation is during STAR testing, as opposed to the rest of the year. One of my kids actually said last year that she had to do well on her STAR tests so she can go to a good college.
The case began last week. Thin gruel, maybe, as far as the evidence was concerned, but the state had one advantage, I thought. The crime was so heinous - the video of the crime scene was hard to watch, and the testimony of Hanneken's fiancée was emotional - that if a juror thought that Winfrey did it, that might be enough. Who cares about reasonable doubt?
Jay-Z, a late addition to the All Points West lineup, opened his Friday night set with a tribute to the act he was replacing: the Beastie Boys. His first song was the Beasties' "No Sleep Till Brooklyn," with the "Beastie Boys at the Garden" line in the first verse changed to "Jay-Z at All Points West." Immediately after that, he performed his own "Brooklyn (Go Hard)."

At the same time, Campbell was in rehab again. He began to tell his parents that he might pursue a future in counseling, to teach others what he'd learned about addiction. He confided in his father that he might try renewing his left-handed pitching skills. He'd gained 30 pounds of muscle since he last played baseball in high school, and he might have a shot at making waves in the sport. Wayne Campbell encouraged his son's forward thinking. He seemed happy.
The story of the Trail Blazers' 106-92 opening win over Phoenix might be a recurring one all season: They’re a lot tougher to guard when they have an extra shooter on the court instead of their starting five.

Gerard, who figures to be one of the top players at St. Ignatius this year, made putts of 20, 25 and 30 feet en route to posting six birdies and two bogeys on the Weiskopf Course. One of his bogeys was a startling 6 on the 609-yard 13th hole. He took two penalty strokes for unplayable lies but knocked his sixth shot into the hole from 115 yards with a pitching wedge.

Some in our government are claiming that U.S.-born anti-American Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in self defense by a C.I.A.-operated drone; they expect us to buy the nonsense that America, a huge and powerful nation was so terrified of this man's jihadist tongue that it had to take him out as soon as an opportunity presented itself.

Dave Hunt, a Democratic leader of Oregon's House of Representatives, is Savas' lead challenger and a capable public servant. His leadership in 2009's passage of the state's Jobs and Transportation Act, which helped Clackamas County, was exemplary, along with his current advocacy for the Columbia River Crossing. But while Hunt showed himself in the Legislature to be quite effective, he was too often divisive.

Jeff Darlington, NFL.com: "Taking Mark Sanchez off the field isn't the same as taking Tom Brady off the field. Tebow can help the Jets if used properly, and offensive coordinator Tony Sparano might be an ideal person to get that done. This, of course, might not be popular with everyone. But Tebow isn't interested in simply making popular decisions. He's into putting himself in situations where he's wanted by the coaches he plays for, where he'll have a chance to succeed. In Jacksonville, at least by all appearances, the owner and the fan base craved his potential presence, while the coaching staff and personnel department were lukewarm at best. In New York, it didn't take the nod from ownership to push this decision."

We live in a time when cynicism about politicians permeates our society. The drumbeat is incessant and discouraging. There are, of course, all too many examples of public officials whose behavior has earned well-deserved scorn. But that pervasive suspicion paints too broadly and drives away from public service those who could serve effectively. In our view, Tim Hagan has been the kind of public official we would regret losing to the prevailing tide of distrust.

Calling House contests isn't as simple as averaging a few polls in the 435 districts and declaring likely winners. Polls are sparse in some races, and pollsters struggle to identify likely voters when turnout typically is light in midterms. In addition, local surveys don't always square with national trends or with other signals political scientists study, such as presidential approval ratings or economic conditions.

On the range before Sunday's final round, Woods launched iron after iron from the right side of the range, into a stiff breeze. LaCava stood behind him. Swing coach Sean Foley, dressed in all black, rotated around Woods every few swings, nodding in approval. For 20 minutes, the coach uttered not a word to the student, standing there more to offer moral support than actual guidance. Everything is stronger, sharper, cleaner now. LaCava told a story about how, a few years ago, Woods used to hit 5-irons about 195 yards. Earlier this week, he hit one 232, uphill, with a flight so piercing that it might as well have been on a string."

I think the hardest part is going to be the sleep deprivation.

Tokyo sushi master Jiro Ono operates a tiny 10-seat restaurant where he turns vinegared rice and sliced fish into world-class culinary art.
