* The Blues' forechecking game, a hallmark of their success, has all but vanished in this series. LA is cruising out of the defensive end and moving into the neutral zone without much problem. Unable to keep the Kings pinned down in the defensive zone -- something the Blues did to opponents all season -- the Blues are suffering from a severe shortage of offensive zone time. It's pretty much been a one-shot-and-done offense. Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick is outstanding, but except for the first period of Game 1, he hasn't been challenged by the Blues. In the first period of Game 3, Quick should have taken his Ipad out to the goal cage with him so he could have paid some bills or written some e-mails while he waited for the Blues to give him something to do.

It's hard to imagine why a politician as successful as Kasich didn't spot what was wrong with that picture. That's especially so given that Ohio's first black Cabinet member, the late William O. Walker of Cleveland, was appointed by Republican Gov. James Rhodes, whose dynamism Kasich seems to admire. What's more, from 1879 until the late Carl Stokes, a Democrat later elected Cleveland's mayor, won election to the Ohio House in 1962, all of Ohio's black state legislators had been Republicans.

All that would be fine if the franchise's creative team had any sense of fun about what they're making (a la "True Blood").

Four of the dead aviators since then were Italians, military pilots or military engineers, who otherwise likely would have flown over Libya in the 1911-12 war and dropped grenades with Lt. Gavotti.

The good news is that there's still time for the council to right itself before its official work begins. The members have to learn to work collegially, openly and without regard to party labels. They need to be creative -- there's no excuse lamer than "that's how it's always been done." They need to remember they were sent to do a part-time job -- it says so in the charter -- not to start building empires. The 15 members of the Allegheny County Council in Pittsburgh make do with eight shared staffers and one-fifth the pay.
"What I can say is that, ultimately, when this investigation is over with, we will be doing a post-study on this entire investigation — everybody's involvement, across the board. And we will be able to identify those things that we personally can improve on but we can also identify what I believe would be the weaknesses that may have or could have attributed to this. Those are the things that come out of a post-evaluation on this type of a thing. And this is something that once that's complete — the public will be actively involved, obviously your paper will be actively involved in that — that information needs to go out because if there are concerns, I think we as a community, our public officials need to start making adjustments internally to protect our children."

These are the easy answers. And like most easy answers, they are partially true. But they don't tell the whole truth, because they overlook a harder and more fundamental truth. The hard truth is that the war in Iraq is not about a catalog of many mistakes - it is about one big mistake. The war in Iraq should never have been fought.

MR. BUSH: The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. And you bet I want to open up a small part of -- a part of Alaska because when that field is online it will produce a million barrels a day. Today we import a million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country, as opposed from Saddam Hussein.... We've got abundant supplies of energy here in America and we better get after it and better start exploring it, otherwise we're going to be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.

“Beer,” says Victor Rallo, owner of Basil T’s, “has been good to me.” The Red Bank restaurant/brew pub, across the street from the Molly Pitcher Inn, boasts the state’s biggest mug club and Maxwell’s Dry Stout, a 2002 Great American Beer Festival gold medal winner. Basil T’s brews about 1,000 barrels a year; the head brewer is Gretchen Schmidhausler, a former newspaper reporter, of all things. When Rallo and his since-deceased father, also Victor Rallo, stopped serving other beer in 1997, distributors predicted they’d be out of business in no time. Basil T’s is going strong. The food may be the best at any of the state’s brew pubs. The menu runs from pizza and antipasti to pasta, chicken and fish dishes. Every Sunday means Big Vic’s Sunday Sauce — homemade braciole, Italian sausage and meatballs, with house-made rigatoni, fresh peas, ricotta cheese and filetto pomodoro. My favorite brews here: Rosie’s Pale Ale and the XXX Summer Ale.

Young allegedly shared some anti-Semitic sentiments with fellow tourists, then tackled one of them. In a statement Monday night, baseball commissioner Bud Selig referred only to "the incident," and Tigers president and general manager Dave Dombrowski would not disclose why, exactly, Young was suspended.

Three sections: Snacks that will go for $4-$5, plates for $10-$17 and desserts for $5-$8. We will probably have five snacks, 10 plates and two desserts. There will be a lot of focus on vegetables. And Will likes to do several iterations of the same ingredient on the same plate, so you will see a lot of that. We will have a seasonal fruit dessert, plus a chocolate dessert will be available all the time from (former Park Kitchen cook) David Briggs.

He spoke softly — often saying "Yes, sir" — and seemed to choose his words carefully when talking about sharing the ball. "I mean, it's a team effort in basketball.

T he price of oil rose as high as 3.6 percent on world markets in mid-December, triggered in large measure by Iranian military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz.

There are numerous ways to approach Baroque works such as J.S. Bach's great Mass in B-minor, BWV 232. You can go with a small ensemble, the way Bach himself would have done it, using historically informed performance practice, gaining nimbleness and clarity.

The June 18 Scottrade concert featured EMI CCM acts Tomlin and TobyMac, who combine hip-hop, rock and funk with traditional worship lyrics. The show drew about 5,000 people.

Among those raised by Public Citizen: Steady use of proton-pump inhibitors has been associated with severe magnesium deficiencies, which can cause painful muscle cramps and potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (the FDA warned consumers in March of this safety concern). Long-term use at high doses is linked to fractures of the hip, wrist and spine -- although, after review, the FDA chose not to issue a warning to that effect, saying that short-term use at lower doses is safe. The medications can reduce the effectiveness of some heart drugs when they are taken together, and the possibility of interference with cancer chemotherapies is being widely researched. Finally, two studies published in the Archives of Internal Medicine have linked use of these antacid drugs to higher rates of recurrent C difficile infection, causing severe diarrhea.

Wheat's early release prompted Marion County Superior Court Judge Carol Orbison, who originally sent the former coach off to prison, to raise objections with the state Department of Corrections.

That is due to rise to 80 GW-equivalent by the end of this decade and to 400 GWe by 2050. WNA assumptions see 20 GWe of nuclear power online in India by 2020 and 63 GWe by 2032.

So far, the former Massachusetts governor has relied on a network of wealthy contributors to finance his run. Just 9% of the nearly $63 million Romney raised through the end of January came from supporters who gave $200 or less, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. In contrast, almost half the money given to his GOP rivals Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, as well as President Obama, came from small donors.
For their next exploding cigar, the Democrats chose polygamy. Brian Schweitzer, the Democrat governor of Montana, remarked that Romney was unlikely to appeal to women because his father was "born on a polygamy commune." Eighty-six percent of women, noted Gov.

* After winning the World Series for the third time, Tony La Russa retired as Cardinals' manager to cap a brilliant 35-season career in the dugout. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig has asked La Russa to manage the National League squad in the 2012 All-Star Game. It was a classy and appropriate invitation by Selig. And TLR quickly accepted. La Russa is one of the greatest managers in MLB history, and his retirement came suddenly and rather unexpectedly. There was no "Farewell Tour," no send-off. The All-Star Game will at least give La Russa a chance to take a bow. Fans and baseball people will get a chance, if ever so briefly, to formally salute La Russa's career. And that's good.

Residents may, of course, demand an adequately funded fire department, but that is a political question more than a legal one, and it is the job of county executives to balance those priorities with voters' demands for low taxes. Doing so is bound to involve unpopular choices, and it's easier to blame state government mandates than to take responsibility for them. But Maryland has wisely recognized the unique importance of public education, and complain though they might, local officials have to live with that.
