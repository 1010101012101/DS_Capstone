Usually, carry-on liquids must be in containers no larger than 3.4 ounces and fit into a single, quart-size, zip-top, clear plastic bag.

Comprehensive health insurance is a matter of economic security.

O'Donnell is Smith's guy in the Assembly 31st District. O'Donnell decided that he would be loyal to Assemblyman Joe Cryan's bid last year to return to leadership after the Democrats ousted him as majority leader. This annoyed Sen. Nick Sacco, who is also mayor of North Bergen, who at the time was pushing for Assemblyman Vincent Prieto of Secaucus. Prieto wound up chairman of the Budget Committee, making Nick happy, and O'Donnell wound up in the dog house, well, actually removed from the Assembly Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee (as in money) and placed in the less popular Homeland Security and State Preparedness panel.

Besides, if Time Warner wouldn't cooperate, why make it look bad? My entire segment was canceled. I was furious. I threw a tantrum.

Well, cmaglaughlin, you sure are a hothead, aren't you. Temper, temper now. I made comments about the Magic and you had to go and turn it into a personal attack. I won't stoop to your level (the gutter), I'll just simply say you go ahead and waste your time and money and enjoy yourself watching them lose. I have more productive things to do with my time then watch a bunch of overpaid losers run up and down the court trying to look like a professional team while getting beat by all the good teams that are out there. Just remember, the Heat haven't been around as long as the Magic and they already have their championship rings. Now that's a professional, well run team that Florida can be proud of. The "Tragic" Magic are just a bunch of losers like yourself.

That foraging is dangerous. Newbies sometimes assume that there are many lethal plants and that it could be tricky to identify them -- but once you know how to identify a particular species, you're really unlikely to get it mixed up with another. Plants all have unique characteristics. The stems have hair or thorns or no hair at all, the leaves are shaped a particular way and have a particular texture, the structure of the branching happens in one of many specifics patterns, and so on.

A former quarterback himself - at Western Michigan University from 1960 to 1962 - he is nationally known as a "quarterback guru" for both amateurs and pros. He says he left pro football in 1987, after serving as quarterback coach for the San Diego Chargers, because "the players were running the asylum." Then after sitting out for a couple of years, he got a phone call from Jon Kirkham, a student at football powerhouse De La Salle High School in Concord, asking if he would be willing to train him as a quarterback. Theder still loved football, so he agreed, and soon Kirkham's teammate Mike Bastianelli gave him a call. And Theder's phone kept ringing.

Berl is a good man. So firmly are we set behind his eyes that we can't see him from any other perspective, though not everyone in the book sees him this way. His confidence comes not from hubris but rather from his complete lack of self-awareness. Berl doesn't seem to understand the extent to which Tessa has fallen for him. When her life falls to pieces and she is brought into his clinic with a knife she has put in her own stomach, Berl does his very best to fix her. The hospital administration accuses Berl of foul play — people start to look at him funny; old friends don't want to be seen with him. He becomes the stranger (in the sense Camus intended) in his community, but not, to McGuane's credit, to us, his readers.
As the assistant intelligence officer on USS Blue Ridge, the evacuation flagship, I was in the command center that morning 37 years ago along with only a handful of others, including Brig. Gen. Richard Carey, commanding the 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade for the evacuation of Saigon, who was on the radio personally directing the final evacuation flights. Gen. Cary was the only flag officer remaining in the command center, since the others had left to greet Ambassador Martin upon his arrival on Blue Ridge. Martin was ordered to be evacuated, forcibly if necessary, by a personal message from Henry Kissinger, after unacceptably prolonging the evacuation into daylight hours, thereby setting the stage for the drama of the Last Man Out. The ambassador's delays, increasingly poor weather and exhausted flight crews had reduced the number of helicopter sorties to the embassy to a dribble as the evacuation was finally concluding.

There is an art to the sports-figure apology. In most legal cases, athletes need to be careful not to admit they were guilty.

A warm martini is a bad martini, and a warning sign that either you're drinking very slowly or your drink is too big.

The stemless glass fits into a bowl to be filled with cooling ice and water when it's not in your hand, or use it to keep shrimp cocktails cold or toddies hot.

Sutter moved to Los Angeles in 2000. He completed a speculative script for a feature film, “Delivering Gen,” a dark love story between a junkie and a hit man. Although the script was never produced, it opened several doors, placing the novice writer in meetings with Hollywood’s power players. He was then commissioned to write TV scripts on spec for existing shows, an audition process of sorts that’s common for new writers. One script in particular, for the hit NBC show “The West Wing,” impressed Shawn Ryan, the creator of “The Shield.” Sutter was hired as a staff writer for season one of “The Shield,” and by season six, he had been promoted to executive producer.

"They say they're going to change and attract Latinos, but without changing their policies," said Lisa Garcia Bedolla, a political scientist who teaches cultural studies at UC Berkeley. "There's a willful ignorance that allows them to think that they can bash illegal immigrants because they don't vote. But even native-born Latinos see it targeted toward them. There are a lot of mixed families, and these people move in and out of each others' lives."
At the turn of the century, Chinatown was a neighborhood of narrow streets and dilapidated Victorians -- the oldest part of San Francisco. Immigrants, most of them bachelors, had added balconies, displaying silk-and-bamboo lanterns and other touches of their homeland: potted flowers and plants, signs in Chinese, triangular yellow flags with a dragon to signify the merchant's rank. After the quake, the city's Reconstruction Committee wanted to move Chinatown 6 miles away to Hunters Point.

With the rich "shark's fin" soup with ham and a black truffle custard, Ha wisely went for the 1968 Blandy's Verdelho Madeira, where the rich caramelized flavors matched but didn't overpower the soup. Monkfish liver torchon had the character of foie gras but with fishy overtones; he chose a German Spatlese Riesling. On pairing after pairing, the staff nailed the matches.
Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing. Our deficit will grow. More families will go bankrupt. More businesses will close. More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it most. And more will die as a result. We know these things to be true.

The huge amount of money that Greece will receive can be divided by the number of the euro-zone inhabitants, and each person can calculate his or her own "contribution." However, the "opportunity" costs arising from the loss of a potentially higher growth rate, which is much more difficult for a non-economist to imagine, will be far more painful. I do not doubt that for political reasons this price will be paid and that the euro-zone inhabitants will never find out just how much the euro truly cost them.
During the April 24 meeting, school district attorney Glenn Gould explained the legal concept of "design immunity." He said that as long as the district is working to correct any potential seismic hazards at Lexington, it is immune from liability. "There doesn't have to be anybody saying, 'You have to get the kids out tomorrow.' It's all about understanding what the consequences are," Gould said. "If you had knowledge of a hazardous condition and you've decided not to address California Geological Survey concerns, that removes design immunity from the table."

No fans of the originals will be disappointed, as this is an interest homage. The story starts with the three being dropped off at an orphanage. It’s both cute and hysterical, to see babies with the Stooge hair. And watching the child actors do their impersonations is a bit of fun.

In the unanimous consent that sent the Senate in recess, it was explicitly stated that the Senate would conduct no business during this period, from December 17th or something until January 23rd. That sounds like a recess to me, and as a legal matter, it is very much a recess.

The Republican coalition is smaller, but it's uniformly conservative. But there remains a divide between Democratic activists and non-activists. Non-activists are very moderate and include quite a few conservatives. Furthermore, non-activists make up the vast majority of the party and are ideologically situated right between the liberal and conservative "peaks" of each party's activist base. Republicans can win by attracting those moderate and conservative Democrats; in fact, the GOP is sunk without them. If Democrats can bring them securely into the fold, they are unbeatable.

Britain's Olympic team coach Stuart Pearce will travel to the United States next week to watch David Beckham play for the Galaxy before deciding whether to select the 36-year-old midfielder for the London Games.
Nope, the humor is fast-paced, bright and often downright silly. "Titus Andronicus" is played as a cooking show, "Othello" is a rap song and the histories are done as a football game, with the British crown serving as the ball and power as the goal. And so it goes, breathlessly through the entire first act, which ends with the cast sweating, the audience chuckling and everyone realizing that the cast didn't do all of Shakespeare's works. "Hamlet," of all things, was left out.

The scholar in question, John Newton Templeton, was freed from slavery as a child and later brought to Ohio University as a "student-servant" in 1824 by university President Robert Wilson.

Some of the changes it got knocked out had to do with law-enforcement subpoena power, requirements that businesses have to maintain certain records and language regarding entrapment. The final result, Taylor said, is a bill "that is not overly harmful to job creation and wouldn't create new bureaucratic hurdles for businesses."

You can believe me when I say that thinking women who read your newspaper appreciated the exposure you gave to yet another pro-life (read Anti-Abortionist Republican) assault on women.

Q: What are the dangers associated with animal bites?
Justice Roberts began the parade of false analogies by asking whether, by extension of the Obama administration's logic, Congress could require people to buy cellphones. The need to utilize emergency services such as the fire department or an ambulance is unpredictable, just like the need to pay for health care, he said. "So can the government require you to buy a cellphone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services?" Justice Roberts asked. "You can just dial 911 no matter where you are?"
The Taliban can withdraw to bases in Pakistan and fight at a time and place of its choosing, just as the North Vietnamese Army relied on bases in Laos and Cambodia. If you can't or won't stop the infiltration, you can't gain the initiative.

Prior to those films, Brand was primarily known in his native England as a lewd stand-up comedian whose personal troubles were frequently splashed across the tabloids. Now eight years sober, it took him longer to kick the proclivity for sleeping around that led the English tabloid the Sun to name him "Shagger of the Year" three years in a row. After a stint in rehab at Pennsylvania's KeyStone sex addiction clinic — which he wrote about in his first memoir, 2007's "My Booky Wook" — Brand began living life on the straight-and-narrow. Last October, after a year of dating, he wed pop star Katy Perry at a lavish ceremony in India.

• As the Daily News' Frank Isola pointed out, Woodson has an uphill battle ahead of him: "Mike Woodson will be without two key starters for Game 3: Stoudemire and rookie Iman Shumpert, who suffered a season-ending left knee injury during the second half of Game 1. Of course, the Knicks played well without Stoudemire this season, going 14-5 when he was sidelined... After Stoudemire was diagnosed with a bulging disc in his back, the Knicks went 9-4 with him sidelined and Carmelo Anthony shifted to power forward. However, during those 13 games Shumpert, one of the league’s top perimeter defenders, was available... In all likelihood, Woodson’s Game 3 lineup will include Tyson Chandler at center, Anthony at power forward and either Steve Novak or J.R. Smith at small forward with Landry Fields the shooting guard and Baron Davis at point guard."

The tribal tension is just one of the cascading problems that confront South Sudan, including a near-total lack of infrastructure and a war on its disputed border with Sudan that has caused 80,000 people to flee into South Sudan.
