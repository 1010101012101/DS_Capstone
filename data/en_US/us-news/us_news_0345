After spending the past decade as head of a struggling Cleveland nonprofit that helps low-income men prepare for the job market, I can't help but think that, as a region, our priorities are scrambled.
No doubt, it was another good show from Melo: He was about to unleash that undefinable magic again, and that is worth the price of admission in April, but in the end, the Heat left him on the side of the highway muttering, “It was all a blur. ... I don’t even know, I don’t even know what happened. ... It just happened so fast.”

To see why house prices and inflation are linked, consider that inflation is a general rise in the price of consumable goods and services. We measure it as a nation just as you might think: pollsters collect prices on thousands of items and statisticians turn those prices into an index, called the Consumer Price Index.

Honda and Acura trail-blazed the one-price, tech-package approach and it has served those companies well. Kia's doubling down on discount amenities is a beautiful way to get consumers to take the car and the brand seriously, and it seems to be working. As of March, Kia is the fastest-growing car company in the U.S., in part thanks to the record 15,000 Optimas that passed through dealership doors last month.
It's never been easier, for instance, to circulate misleading, out-of-context and embarrassing material about someone.
They rebounded nicely for the real tournament, and through it all, the coach refused to apologize for the way he recruits or how he runs his program. Just playing by the rules as they're set up, he says, even if he doesn't totally agree with them. Because he refuses to promise minutes or shots to any recruit and demands teamwork out of all of them, he says he comes by these players honestly.

Sayles toggles back and forth between those worlds. In one scene, Compton reads a list of orders to the villagers, while members of the rebel army, hiding out in the fields, are read a similar list; both end with the warning that disloyalty is punishable by death.
Well, you have a sturdy, if somewhat predictable, tale of a middle-class striver triumphing over sexism and classism -- only, ironically, to become a bit of a bully and a terrible snob.

Take a good look at Oddstad School because chances are in a year it will no longer exist. What replaces Oddstad School may affect our property values — either positively or negatively. The Pacifica School District will be holding a public meeting regarding this important issue on Wednesday, Feb. 29, at 7 p.m. at Ortega School. Possibilities for this prime piece of property that have been mentioned are affordable family housing units or a sports complex. The Pacifica School District's Board has declared the majority of the Oddstad School property "surplus" and wants to lease it on a long-term basis. While an exact time frame for the lease has not been determined, I would think in the 50-100 year range would not be an exaggeration. It is doubtful single family homes will be built because homeowners would not own the land. The Board would like a lessee to take over as soon as Kiewit vacates — which is scheduled for the end of 2012. Since none of the five school board members live in Park Pacifica, I urge everyone who does live back here to attend this meeting and let them know that we care about our neighborhood. I am a 29-year resident of Park Pacifica and love living here. I want to be sure it continues to be a quiet, safe neighborhood where you can find people walking their dogs late at night and do not have to worry. Let's be sure that does not change. Please show up and speak up.

Maietta said the Board of Education formed a search committee that interviewed a number of prospective coaches and weighed its options before making a hiring recommendation to current North Bergen Schools Superintendent Robert Dandorph.
Menendez knows that gripe. Without prompting, he and his aides repeat the theme that his position at the DSCC opens doors to bring a "New Jersey perspective" to the Senate’s leadership. "I am in a room with the five senators, and I can bring a New Jersey voice in there." He stressed that he has added a Garden State viewpoint to the health care discussion and debates over the alternative-minimum tax, which hits New Jerseyans in greater numbers than those in some other regions.

Sacco is one of 15 lawmakers — 14 Democrats and one Republican — along with DiVincenzo, arguably the state’s most influential county executive, who have accrued about $850,000 worth of unused time that they could turn into cash, the analysis shows.

But I want to encourage states to take action to improve their schools. And there are a number of ways of doing that. I didn't mention that we have a statewide curriculum.

But I happen to be someone who supported No Child Left Behind. I thought it was important for us to finally start testing our kids. There are a lot of problems -- I'd like to see it changed and improved -- but I want to keep testing our kids, I want to encourage school choice, I like the idea that the best teachers receive additional compensation.

Assembling an impressive cast helps too. When PJ Sosko (who played Hank Stamper in PCS's 2008 production of Kesey's "Sometimes a Great Notion") swaggers onto the stage as McMurphy, it's impossible not to compare him to Nicholson.

Beltran posted on Twitter two nights ago that his selections were 3, 8, 13, 40 and 43. The Cardinals' open numbers are few because there are as many as 17 numbers -- 18 if you include No. 25 for coach Mark McGwire -- that are officially retired or unofficially on hold. This offseason has added three new numbers to the off-limits list: Nos. 5, 10 and 18, the latter of which belongs to pitching coach Dave Duncan. Lance Berkman joked at the writers' dinner on Sunday night that he wondered "if it's too early to ask for No. 5 or No. 10." The Cardinals are going to retire No. 10. That's a given. No. 5 is out for the time being as they decide what to do with Albert Pujols' former number as he puts up milestone numbers for a nother team.
Affleck says he understands there are plenty of people who just want to be entertained. He hopes that — in between the dialogue-driven dramatic scenes — his “The Town” offers enough action to please genre fans, too.

Artspace , which launched in April, offers a more populist approach to collecting. Yes, it sells boldface names like Gary Hume, Jenny Holzer and Chris Ofili, whose pieces garner figures well out of more modest budgets. But by leveraging an extensive network of partnerships with galleries, museums and foundations, Artspace is able to present exclusive limited editions—such as two photo-works by the London-based duo Gilbert & George, priced at $4,000 (with proceeds benefiting the Brooklyn Museum). And while Artspace's prices are hardly low, the chance to snag a sculpture by Kehinde Wiley for $1,400, or a print by art collective Assume Vivid Astro Focus for $250, is hard to dismiss. More art-by-the-yard enthusiasts can search by groupings, such as "Gifts for the Home," and membership provides access to weeklong private sales.

The man plays hurt. The man plays hard. After badly spraining his ankle last week, he played a team-high 41 minutes in Game 1 and team-high 38-minutes in Game 2. He's also the one who came up with the playoff mantra – "We All We Got" – that has become a rallying cry for Magic players and fans alike.

The timing of the Mara-Tisch partnership couldn’t have been better. Professional football was changing. As the NFL gained popularity, the scale of the business grew. Wellington Mara, who had influenced the league’s growth as much as he guided his own team, could see what was coming. It was important to him that Tisch was experienced and skilled in business, Tagliabue said.
"When I arrived in Alaska, I was turning 30. I'd been playing fiddle for a few years, but I wasn't much of a fiddler player. I moved up there to go to graduate school, an MFA program in creative writing, fiction."
With Webb and second year cornerback Jimmy Smith under contract, the Ravens have two potential shut down cornerbacks while most teams in the NFL don't have one. Webb is just starting to enter his peak years, and Smith could become one of the better cornerbacks in the league. If they continue to progress, it would certainly help the Ravens pass rush.
"We had nothing when we got married," Irene says. "In Mexico, it would have been impossible for us to make a living, or get a roof over our head, a home. I wanted more for my future children."
Some have come to see Ravi as a victim of an overzealous legal system, a man convicted not so much for what he did but what happened afterward. Last month, former Gov. Jim McGreevey, who left office in 2004 after announcing he was gay, wrote an opinion piece in The Star-Ledger newspaper arguing against a prison sentence for him.
One of the group's missions is to create a safer and cleaner event with a "Leave No Trace" goal in terms of trash. Another priority is to improve neighborhood relations, because complaints from neighbors and some businesses led the push to get the festival under control.

Kansas State freshman receiver Tyler Lockett is following in the footsteps of his father and uncle and off to a good start in pursuit of their accomplishments. Kevin Lockett, Tyler's dad, played for coach Bill Snyder in the mid-1990s and is the school's all-time leading receiver with 217 catches for 3,032 yards. His uncle, Aaron, is fourth with 137 and 2,400. Tyler Lockett has 12 catches for 190 yards and two touchdowns so far.
"You want everything clicking and clicking right," Jackman said. "You don't want to be working out things the first couple games of the playoffs. You want to have everyone on the same page, know what to expect from each teammate, and go in with that mindset that if we play our best hockey we're going to win games."
Castroneves, a three-time Indianapolis 500 champion and fan favorite, thrilled the crowd at the Belle Isle GP in 2000 when he climbed the fence in celebration of his win for Roger Penske and followed with another Spider-Man like performance in 2001. Having won the season-opening IZOD IndyCar Series race at St. Petersburg this season, Castroneves could go for a third climb this summer.

Panitch previously revealed her client believes Hemy Neuman was having an affair with Sneiderman's widow. Andrea Sneiderman has not addressed those claims, saying only that she considered Neuman, her former supervisor at GE Energy, "a friend of our family."
Instead of being "worried about alienating voters," Obama's campaign "should be worried about energizing voters," said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, a national organization in favor of same-sex marriage.
But what if those two teams are one and done, and their first opponents -- the No. 5 seeds Wichita State and New Mexico -- go on to cause some damage of their own? As you can see, this is pretty risky business. Pick the wrong bracket-buster and your bracket could be, well, busted.
The American people would be more justified in criticizing the president for irresponsibly standing by than for doing something.
Fertilize carefully. While strawberries do need a steady source of nutrients to produce well, avoid overfeeding with nitrogen, as this will create lush foliage, but no fruit. At planting time and then on a monthly basis during growth, feed with an organic fertilizer that contains ingredients such as worm castings, alfalfa meal, guano, bone meal and blood meal.

The former president would have turned 100 tomorrow, and so there's been an avalanche of stuff about him. Former White House speechwriter Peggy Noonan appreciated Reagan, Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief David Corn did not. For a very personal reminisce of Reagan -- one with special punch for anyone who's ever watched a parent slip away into the mists of dementia -- check out the piece his daughter Patti Davis wrote for Time. And if you want to check your knowledge of Reagan trivia, U.S. News and World Report is the place to go.

However, the Ipsos poll shows his efforts don't appear to be resonating with far-right voters: the percentage of Ms. Le Pen's supporters who will vote for Mr. Sarkozy in the second round fell to 54% from 60%. Instead, Mr. Sarkozy is benefiting from a stronger potential transfer of support from centrist candidate François Bayrou, who took 9.13% of the first round vote. Out of his voters, 40% now say they will transfer their votes to Mr. Sarkozy, an eight percentage point increase, the poll showed.
There is something un-Christian about the Gospel According to Paul Ryan. So, at least, says Ryan's Catholic Church.
-- Use caution when recipes give "minutes per pound" cooking times - an increase in size doesn't mean a proportional increase in cooking time. For example, a 7-rib 15-pound standing rib roast is much longer, but not that much thicker, than a 3-rib 7-pound roast, so it will not take twice as much time to cook.

And, if I were picking a state song, I'd go with "Orange Blossom Special," a bluegrass showstopper rich in Florida's history. The composer, Ervin Rouse, was a Floridian (albeit a transplanted one) and Chubby Wise, the fiddler who made his career on the song, was a native.
While I believe every home should feature some furnishings from countries for which you need a passport and shots to visit, that's not blanket permission to run through an international bazaar with a backhoe.
In the previous survey in July, the economists predicted unemployment of 8.7 percent at the end of next year. In the survey before that, they foresaw 8.4 percent. Some now think unemployment won't drop to a historically normal 5.5 percent to 6 percent until at least 2018 -- several years later than envisioned earlier.

Even in that time frame, a comeback seemed improbable. MU hadn't put up a TD since the first half as it took over at its own 30.
As in many David Fincher films -- the most visually distinctive of which are "Se7en," "Fight Club" and "The Panic Room" -- the look is much of the medium. The distinctive cinematographer Harris Savides has used digital cameras to create a world of brooding moods that's slightly artificial, elusively abstracted, and not only in the film's several spasms of murderous violence. The period evocations are vivid: men's shaggy haircuts and long sideburns, of course; plaid jackets; smoking allowed in the last six rows of commuter airplanes.
If going on four decades of watching people in public life have taught me anything, it's the folly of presuming to know another man's heart -- especially when the heart in question belongs to someone as disciplined and well-defended as Bing.

Those pushing for a state-appointed board or a breakup of the district's boundaries must be able to articulate how their approach is superior. Wonderful if they can. But if not, they need to back off. Understandably, some civic leaders might still be chafing that they guzzled Covington's Kool-Aid. That's not a reason to throw caution to the wind or perform a power grab on the district.

JERSEY CITY — A bill that would offer private and parochial school scholarships to some Newark students would give those children the chance at a bright future that many of their public schools deny them today, Newark Mayor Cory Booker said during a keynote address in Jersey City.
The historic Danville building originally was constructed in 1848. It was badly damaged by fire in 1912 and rebuilt. The Crawley family purchased the building in the 1950s. They turned the upper floor into an apartment; the main floor was Doc Crawley's dental office. When the bureau moved into the space, the back room still housed dentist chairs and jars of teeth that have since been donated to various organizations.

"I'm in love with volleyball," he said.
The gradually increasing realization among much of humanity that the myths told by priests, rabbis and imams for millennia are just that -- myths -- has forced "us" to confront difficult and troubling questions about morality and the meaning of life. That we should strive to be more compassionate, to have a broader perspective, to experience more awe, is unassailably true. It's also true that religion, in its finest moments, has helped people do so. But to make the leap that, therefore, it is the methods of religion that are the only way to continue the quest for existential meaning, borders on the absurd.
Pre-registration deadline has been extended to April 10th to include a t-shirt. Registrations on race day cannot be guaranteed a t-shirt.
Though ordinarily I'm not a big fan of merlot, there was no denying the allure of this interpretation. It was broad and deep with sunny, plummy fruit, a touch of intriguing leafiness, gentle tannins despite a supportive superstructure, and refreshing acidity. It is precisely the kind of merlot that accounted for the varietal's booming popularity a couple of decades ago  fresh, juicy and long, but mostly readily accessible.
The best of the entrees were the fiery Korean pork, which packed a peppery wallop, and the Chaing Mai pad Thai, a cut above the standard with its additions of dried shrimp and sweet radishes. A pretty but somewhat thin Massaman curry had the right balance of mild flavors. The salt-and-pepper fried seafood entree — there's a stellar version at Grace Garden in Odenton — had too much salt and not enough pepper.
Ross Stolzenberg, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, said this period of time resembles -- on some levels -- the Great Depression.
Chris Schwinden (eight innings, 11 runs) failed in his two-start tryout. Up next on Tuesday is Miguel Batista, the 41-year-old journeyman, a player known more for versatility than for dominance, like a Swiss Army knife with dull blades.

During World War II, he joined the Norwegian resistance and helped avert the shipment of students to German concentration camps. During the 1960s, he became involved in environmental activism and was once arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience at a waterfall where a dam was planned. He also wrote a manual to help activists who were involved in nonviolent protests. In 1958, he founded an interdisciplinary journal of philosophy called Inquiry.
Batzel said the third option is likely to be the most palatable for residents. That would be a sales tax increase of four-tenths of 1 percent, or 40 cents for each $100 purchase.

As far as being a leader goes, Owens led by example, proving that racial supremacy was a theory that had to, literally, eat his dust. Magic proved that a big man could handle a basketball as well as a little one and could enjoy himself while doing so. Grange put the fledgling NFL on the map.

Jeff Zrebiec, Ravens reporter: When I first heard about this story a couple of weeks ago, I was probably more surprised about the reaction to it than the fact that something like this actually could go on. Don't get me wrong, I'm not condoning or belittling the actions of the Saints. There's no place for that in the sport, but I was a little surprised how shocked everybody was that something like this could exist given the physical and competitive nature of the NFL. Gregg Williams, who allegedly ran the "bounty" program, got what he deserved with the indefinite suspension. The fine and loss of draft picks also seems fair. But the year-long suspension to coach Sean Payton, along with the eight-game ban of GM Mickey Loomis, seems a bit harsh to me.
Wilson was expected to run for governor in 2000 but dropped that quest in March 1998, citing a distaste for raising the millions of dollars needed for the campaign and a desire to spend more time with his family.

The speedy center fielder, who had one of the faster times in drills at Busch, is a product of the Mathews-Dickey Boys & Girls Club and, as he said, a baseball nut. He hasn't played any other sports because baseball "is his favorite game. Every pitch,
A century after the close of the Western frontier, the county retains its gun-rack rawness. Residents are self-reliant, a necessity in a county bigger than nine states but with just 7,700 residents.
Prices start at $45 and go up to well over $100 for a multicourse meal. On the phone when we made the reservation, we asked for the $50 menu, but when we arrived, we were told there was no $50 menu, so we had to choose either a $45 or a $55. I asked what the difference was, but our server didn't know. "Maybe there's no abalone," he said.
“They need to get angry because they don’t want to understand what I’m talking about,” Marshall said. “They don’t want to follow the argument, but want to put words in my mouth.”
Crudites. Gone are the baby carrots, raw broccoli and celery sticks that mom used to put out with dips; instead, go for plates of sliced fennel, radishes and endive leaves. Little Gem lettuces and sliced jicama are also good choices. Don't shy away from fruit crudites -- slices of crisp Asian pears, bright orange persimmon and any variety of apples go wonderfully with the Goat Cheese Fondue.

But it’s not so wonderful for commuters, who will face major traffic snarls and the shutdown of Newark Light Rail downtown for two days.
K Lawrence Tynes’ blocked field goal went down as a 50-yard attempt and, after the game, I couldn’t figure out why. He clearly kicked it from the 51. (UPDATE: Er, 41. It was a 51-yarder.) Here’s why: after the block, the officials spotted the ball at the 40 for Buffalo to take over. Eh, the Bills didn’t need the extra yard. They went down and tied the game on the next drive anyway.
"We are as close to downtown as we are to Midtown, and we have the waterfront," she said. "We are walkable to Belle Isle."

Receiver R.J. Zayed was appointed Nov. 23 to liquidate Cook's assets, but he has allowed Cook's wife, Gina -- who was not implicated in the scheme -- to remain in their Apple Valley home until she could get her feet under her.

But bad news needn't be big; there are small bits available as well. If it bleeds, it leads on television, and there's always some bleeding out there, some drive-by, some domestic dispute, some guy holed up in his apartment with two hostages and a bathtub full of meth.

But is a new law the answer? In its current form, the bill wouldn't roll back any of these disputed taxes only prevent municipalities from adding new ones. As far as drivers are concerned, that's far from an ideal solution.
Several officials said it would require a decision within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.

"Do it before you croak," she said, launching the presentation with the catch phrase formulated by the team barely an hour before. "Fill the bucket, before you kick the bucket."
I like to imagine we could establish coaster populations to replace some of the declining salmon in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. They stay close to shore and routinely exceed 6 pounds, and I suspect most anglers would love to include something that beautiful in a mixed bag.

"For many it is a revelation that North Koreans open up and play Western pop music with such great joy," he said.
Though it may not immediately be apparent, it wasn't that out of character for the Stooges to make such films. They often used social satire between throwing pies and pounding skulls -- or while doing that, even. Blue-collar friends of the working class (at least their characters), they thumbed their noses at the elite as often as they yanked each other's noses -- and usually got the best of their richer foes.
The win over the Red Devils, in which senior guard Tony Cochran scored 30 points and junior guard Brad Woodson had 27, moved the Golden Griffins to 17-0. The 17 straight victories broke the school record for consecutive wins, which was 16 set in the 1997-98 season.

Looking ahead in the arts realm, the new $35 million Dalí Museum is scheduled to open Jan. 11, just north of the current museum next to the Mahaffey Theater. The 66,450-square-foot facility was designed by architect Yann Weymouth, who assisted with the renovation of the Louvre in Paris.
Lamott strives to learn to love and let go at the same time -- at least occasionally. She takes off for a two-week visit to India and later flies to Stockholm for a cruise of the Baltic ... even as she freaks out about her daughter-in-law's running off to Chicago to be with her own dying grandmother. This is how she balances things, bringing greater perspective to her own situation by seeing life and death on the big canvas of India, and in the museum of a concentration camp in Poland. The young parents are not the only ones who grow up a little in the course of this year.
The three young women call their charitable pursuit Three Moms on a Mission. Their purpose is to raise funds for children requiring surgery to repair birth defects associated with a cleft lip.

Christie's introductory remarks focused on his efforts not to raise taxes in the state and an emphasis on bipartisan cooperation between his office and state Democrats. But the question-and-answer session brought out an array of concerns from citizens ranging from oversight of mental health services and protection of civil liberties to a Palisades Park teacher's concern over the state of her healthcare benefits.

The Pirates are batting .202 as a team, including a .089 mark by shortstop and erstwhile Rockies second baseman Clint Barmes (4-for-45). The Pirates are 6-9 because their pitching staff has compiled a 2.63 ERA.
Five-Second Rule (Patch, $25; 3 or more players; age 10+; 20-30 min.) The premise is deceptively simple, but this game provides a burst of good, undemanding party play for young and old alike. Each card gives a category, and players have to produce three of them within five seconds: three private colleges, three of the original American colonies, three breeds of cat. This is harder under time pressure than you might imagine, which is where the fun comes in. The one downside is the difficulty of settling judgment calls under the same time pressure; also the timer contraption, which substitutes whimsy for usefulness.

The demographic reached by the NBA has always been enticing to longtime sponsor Sprite, said Sharon Byers, Coca-Cola's senior vice president of sports and entertainment for North America.
Contest-winners Dive are the openers before the openers. It's an impossible job, but they're doing their best. At a quarter to seven, the house is almost empty, and the South Jersey quintet plays to thousands of chairs. Their music is energetic, muscular riff rock with anthemic choruses -- not unlike early Bon Jovi. They remind those still finding their seats that they've got a concert coming up at Starland Ballroom on the 13th of June. If half of the still-sparse crowd here attends, it'll be a sellout.
"Imagine a situation in which a chancellor says you can't let them occupy the building, but then they start to move toward the building," Edley said. "If the civilian leadership is nowhere to be found, the police are going to do what they have to do. "

Also unchanged is the state's fiscal crisis, with a projected budget deficit of some $15 billion, or about half the state's general operating fund. That factor has kept gambling expansion fully on the table, as lawmakers look for ways to squeeze more state tax money from the controversial industry.
Off the field, Tuck was engaging and a media darling. When Michael Strahan retired, Tuck became the biggest star in the locker room. He handled it well at first.
China has held the yuan steady against the dollar to help Chinese exporters withstand the global economic crisis. The United States and other countries have pressed China to let its currency rise.

As for the Topography of Terror's exhibitions, they focus on the central institutions responsible for the crimes the Nazis perpetrated throughout Europe. "Our objective is cold, clear documentation: the opposite of denial. We don't want to whitewash, but reveal the details of what happened and how it happened," Lutz said.
Seligman, who grew up in San Francisco, advised Parker early on about the perils of getting things done in this rabidly democratic town, where, as he puts it, "one person can f -- you up. And it doesn't have to be a super-powerful person. They can file lawsuits. They do it all the time. How big was the coalition to stop the de Young? I don't know. But I'm sure it cost a lot of time, money and energy to engage with them.''
Schwartz made it clear no starting jobs are on the line yet, but he said he has no doubt Reiff will be "an experienced, smart, confident player" that is "going to do well for us."
Catherine Givings also transforms. As she grows suspicious of what's really going on in the next room under that sheet, the young mother moves from giddy girl, unsure of what she wants from her marriage, to a woman who demands a few paroxysms of her own from her preoccupied spouse.
So men and women who faced death at Fallujah or Kandahar or Desert Storm are now to face death panels at home? That’s the upshot of the administration’s plans for military health care.

What is your specific role in moving this project/research forward? I recruit the engineering staff, create a fun and exciting work environment, hold workshops to brainstorm product improvement ideas and review engineering work. Value engineers in my group use computer drawing systems, CAD, to make 3-D drawings of parts and machines they invent to make our instruments better. They build and test their designs, and make changes to them until they are working and ready. Then our manufacturing group uses the final CAD drawings to make the parts and put them into products.

Toronto, with nearby Etobicoke being home to Canada Basketball, would be a possible NBA free agency destination for Nash.

Despite friends' reservations about combining her French country and his contemporary style, the union has proved more than compatible.
"I'm going to talk about broadening your horizons," said Christie, "opening up your eyes to all the possibilities in life, not restricting yourself to what you did in college. What your vision of your life is today may not be where your life heads, and you have to use education as a way to open yourself up — not to necessarily direct yourself somewhere but to open yourself up to all the possibilities that life is going to present you."

A smile was only a temporary umbrella. After the Buckeyes reached Michigan State Saturday, Turner curled up in the bleachers and slept again.

"There was so much smoke damage," says Drevis, 11, who was at home with Dyson and Dejohne when the fire started. Dejohne was baby-sitting while their mother finished her shift at a local deli.
In our production meetings, I had asked John Fox on Friday about if this game goes to overtime and you win the coin flip in overtime, do you want the football or are you going to kick with the new postseason overtime rules? I had been very outspoken on the overtime rules for years and years. Of course they went into effect (for the 2010 playoffs), but there were no postseason overtime games until this season. So, we're waiting for that first postseason game with the new rules where the first possession had to be a touchdown to close out a game. Otherwise the other team is guaranteed a possession.

Even though fake IDs are a part of virtually every college student’s memories, in the course of reporting this story, I was amazed by today’s utter accessibility.
"..did you know that taxes are the only thing that grow without water?" Well no, because taxes have been shrinking for the past 50 years. Top income tax rates as follows: 1962:87 percent, 1972:70 percent, 1982:50 percent, 1992:31 percent, 2002:38 percent, 2012:35 percent. Raising taxes on wealthy individuals does not diminish job creation or economic growth. In fact, average year on year growth to GDP in the '60s was 4.6 percent. Thanks to unpaid wars, tax cuts and unbridled financial recklessness in the private sector average year on year GDP growth in the 2000s was 1.5 percent.
To research "Astro-Rama," artist O'Hearn and co-director and composer Jackie Dempsey watched as many "God-awful" movies about UFOs and conspiracy theories as possible to learn ways different cultures treat their myths. How the story is told, rather than the story itself, is the key.

“We’re playing with confidence,” he said. “It’s been a team effort on the defensive side of the ball that’s made the difference. We’re getting behind the ball with everybody and making it hard to break us down. Anytime you have a lot of space and don’t defend as a unit, teams can hurt you.

Under harsh criticism from conservatives, President Barack Obama later said the affiliates could opt out, but insurers must pay for the coverage.

Indeed, time, not Apple, may be the best thing the Nasdaq has going for it right now. Unlike the Dow, which looks to be on its way to making its third top since the turn of the millennium, the Nasdaq has been in a full-blown bear market for 12 years.

Though Phoenix outshot Nashville through the first two periods, Rinne wasn't tested much. He had a shot go off the post in the first period and saw heavier traffic in the crease as the Coyotes shook off a sluggish start. But he never faltered after giving up five goals in Sunday's 5-3 Game 2 loss—the Predators' worst performance of the postseason—snapping Phoenix's team-record streak of three consecutive road playoff wins and a run of three straight wins in Nashville overall snapped. The Coyotes had given up just four goals on the road in the playoffs before Wednesday.

Look, there's no question that "Albert Nobbs" features great acting performances. In fact, they are as great as you will likely find anywhere.

That charm includes an architectural eclecticism that shows how relaxed about itself this city once was.

For example, the tandoori half chicken ($16.95), red from spices and blackened in the oven, was beautifully moist, but the grilled shrimp ($23.95), marinated overnight in yogurt, ginger and fennel, was dry in the center and mushy outside, which was also true of the lamb chops ($27.95).

In a recent school lunch research trip to France with Evans, where we ate multiple school lunches, peered into every walk-in cooler in every school we visited, quizzed school lunch chefs, government and regional officials and pedagogues, we made some discoveries. In France, the norm is regional, in-season food made from scratch or freshly prepared. We saw no prepackaged food at all, except slices of St. Andre or St. Nectaire cheeses. We ate apples from Normandy, parsnips and carrots from the Landes and fresh fish from the Atlantic. In France, school lunch is considered an educational opportunity to present students with a variety of tastes, textures and flavors. We saw 5-year-olds carrying their trays with a green salad, a dinner plate of lentils topped with sautéed pork and carrots, cheese and a Golden Delicious apple for dessert. At a junior high school, students were served an option of a fresh grapefruit half, a green salad or a carrot and cabbage slaw. For their main dish they had mashed parsnips and potatoes, along with a choice of baked chicken thighs or braised beef, cheese and kiwi or an apple. This isn't happening by chance.

The cap-and-trade bill might not reduce carbon emissions during the next decade, but it creates a mechanism for exerting government control over a huge swath of the economy.

A: Although Joe Denton's Walsh Jesuit team didn't make it to Columbus in 2010, the team really played well last year, coming in at 302 and breaking the record set by University School in 2009 by six strokes.

Sprengle figured out a way to put to second use something that might end up in a landfill or waterway. She chose for materials ubiquitous shopping bags. Then she cut off their handles and bottoms, laid three layers of the flat bags under tracing paper and ironed them for about 10 seconds until the plastic melted together. She fused another layer of clear plastic she had found on the top and bottom to seal the tarp. The result is softer than store-bought tarp, she believes, but just as sturdy.

And the cleverest lies are often told by the most focused and socially savvy kids. To tell a plausible lie, children must be able to understand how others see things.

Settling in with other guests — young parents with a baby, a group of 20-something locals, and what appeared to be a 60-year-old dad and his adult son — we perched on the ledge seating, dug our toes in the pea gravel bottom, and watched steam rise from the 103-degree water.
