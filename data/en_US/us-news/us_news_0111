When Horst was 18 years old, he was drafted to fight in the war and soon killed in Italy. Since he was an only child, you and your husband took it very hard. In 1945, when Hitler got really desperate, your husband was drafted at 55 years of age. He was sent to the Battle of Berlin and was killed within a few days. Your sister perished in an air raid by the Nazis, and this now meant that you were all alone. I cannot even begin to imagine the pain you must have felt after losing your entire family to the hands of the Nazis. You endured it all.

We had to pick an airplane that was popular enough that we could buy enough airplanes. There were about 600 Beechjets made. Our second criteria was that the airframe cost had to be low enough that you could buy the airframe, remanufacture it and still produce a plane for about half the cost of a new one. Our third criteria was that it had to be a plane that had some deficiencies. If it was built perfectly from the factory when it was first made there would be no room for improvement.

1 Make powerful shelter decisions. In my new book with economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff ("The Clash of Generations," MIT Press) we show that a retiring middle-income couple can have lifetime discretionary spending - spending after income taxes, Medicare premiums and shelter - of about $15,000 a year if they stay in their home. They can increase it to $28,600 by selling their home and becoming renters. And they can boost it to $38,800 by becoming full-time RVers. Just the difference from owning to renting, $13,600 a year, is the same as adding about $340,000 to their savings.

The Mayo Clinic in Minnesota launched its own news department a decade ago to distribute its "Medical Edge" stories to media outlets nationwide. A Mayo survey showed patients' stated preference for the hospital increased about 60 percent within three years of the news service's launch. Hospital executives said the business value of "Medical Edge" was more than 10 times the cost of producing it, according to the Columbia Journalism Review.

Either fill the ditch with same mulch, or better yet, find another method of edging.

With this, the story settles into the grim rituals that come with any disease, the round of doctors before you know exactly what fate has dealt you, the way complaints about a crying baby are dismissed.

The Atlantic City Aquarium is located in Gardner's Basin. During regular business hours, it features interactive exhibits, including various tanks where you can touch and interact with sea life prominent in the area such as sharks, rays and so much more.
Inside the winery, the décor requires even less attention. The kitchen—restaurant-huge, with six sinks and a commercial-sized stove—is almost all metal, except for the marble on the counters and the big center island, ideal for plating the lunches and dinners served there. A dining area holds a long wood table, a round iron chandelier and a stone fireplace—and little else. Upstairs in the winery office are two classic wood desks and unvarnished alder floors.

But putting Richardson in the O (for ordinary) Zone, if it is in more than a legend's pride-stung bluster, undermines the past three days and blights the coming season. Richardson certainly better add many extras to ordinary. In a throwing league, can he do that unless he's another multi-purpose guy like Marshall Faulk?

"Any sensational news reaches huge numbers of people at lightning speed," says Srini Pillay, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

On Saturday, the day Mr. Berlusconi drove past hecklers to hand his resignation to the Italian president, Mr. Draghi was also in Rome. The new ECB president paid a visit that day to Mario Monti, then considered the leading candidate to replace Mr. Berlusconi.

Declining revenues and increased costs plague all of the states, many to a much higher degree. Maryland is fortunate to have one of the most stable economies in the country. A 1 percent cut is not a doomsday scenario. More efficient use of technology, for example, could be used to absorb the 1 percent cut. Residents have had to absorb a substantial cut in their buying power far in excess of 1 percent. Let's not lose touch with reality. The Maryland General Assembly would be prudent to look at whether this is really "doomsday" or just another case of "the sky is falling."

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's critics sometimes say that he is engineering a government takeover of health care or even introducing "socialized medicine" into America. These allegations are wildly overblown. Government already dominates health care, one-sixth of the economy. It pays directly or indirectly for roughly half of all health costs. Medicine is pervasively regulated, from drug approvals to nursing home rules. There is no "free market" in health care.
But the care it covers is even more expensive. In Minnesota, a private room in a nursing home averages $259 a day, assisted living $4,646 a month and home-health care $26 an hour (all somewhat higher than the national averages).
"We're working on his stages right now," Ross said. "We're working on his arm swings and there are some other things he has to work on.

The promotion of a sous chef can often mean that the owner is trying to save money, and while the status quo of the food is maintained, the menu can fail to advance. At A16, however, Appleman has already begun to subtly reshape the selections, at the same time keeping the spirit of Campania with dishes such as the lamb mixed grill ($22.50). The chunks of lamb from various parts of the animal are marinated for three days in garlic, olive oil and salt, and seared to caramelize the exterior. They are arranged in a rustic pottery vessel with Italian parsley, slices of raw radishes and tart bits of green olives. It's a stunning blend.
It wasn't a quick and easy recovery. The rehabilitation was painful and grueling. It cost Gardner her junior season. When she came back as a senior, she wasn't the same.
He got elected in November on a promise to make government smaller. And the straightforward — some would say in-your-face — way he is doing it is getting noticed.

The bill's backers say Connecticut's outdated telecommunications regulations, which haven't been modernized since 1994 — before the widespread adoption of wireless and voice-over-Internet protocols such as Skype — make it difficult for telecom companies to introduce new technologies that help attract new companies to the state and keep existing businesses here.

Yet at first glance, it seems so guileless. Children just want to be happy. So do puppies. Happy seems like a healthy, normal desire. Like wanting to breathe fresh air or shop only at Whole Foods.
Staal broke the scoreless deadlock, and Girardi gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead with his first NHL playoff goal. Lundqvist allowed Daniel Alfredsson's power-play goal in the second but stood tall the rest of the way to send the Rangers to the second round.
"Without them believing in what I was telling them, it wouldn't have worked," Dinges said, shortly before being doused with ice water. "I kept telling them, 'The reward will be at the end,' and here it is (championship trophy).
"I didn't come back that late that they were saying, but like I said before, I don't want to talk about it," Radulov said. "They did what they had to. I am disappointed, and I understand what is my mistake."
During my visit the wind also was big. So big that 90 percent of the mountain was closed most of the time, with more than 100-mph gusts blasting lift chairs sideways on all but the most protected of slopes, and blowing away what new snow there was, leaving an unpleasant icy base.
Visiting a new playground at Memorial Park in East Orange, Corzine said there were 158 homicides in the first six months of this year, compared to 209 in the same time period in 2008.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosions. Some reports said the blasts had gone off one after the other, timed apparently so that the second blast, which was larger than the first, would catch security forces as they responded.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A 23-year-old Cleveland man was sentenced Monday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court to 24 years in prison for robbing a Family Dollar Store on June 26 last year.

Formed in 1974 in Pasadena, Calif., Van Halen made hard rock palatable for the masses with a virtuoso guitarist in Eddie Van Halen and a lovable, full-of-himself frontman in David Lee Roth, whose departure in 1985 didn't stop the band from cranking out more hits with Sammy Hagar. Given the volatile personalities involved, it's a wonder they got anything done. The band — Michael Anthony (bass), Hagar (vocals), Roth (vocals), Alex Van Halen (drums), Eddie Van Halen (guitar) — had their biggest commercial success with the album 1984, which had the signature songs "Jump," "Panama" and "Hot for Teacher."
5. Add the dressing to the beans a few tablespoons at a time, tossing the salad until it is coated to taste. This makes about 6 cups of salad.
Cut the white portion of the green onions into 1-inch lengths; add those to the pot and set green portions aside. Lightly season broth with soy sauce and pinch of salt. Continue simmering until meat from the neck bones is tender and falling off the bone, about 45-60 minutes more, depending on the size of the pieces.
Using a mortar and pestle, lightly grind all the ingredients except the lime, cilantro and shrimp. When it's a coarse mix, add the lime zest. Heat the olive oil. In a large bowl, combine the shrimp and spice mix. Saute about 5 minutes. Add the lime juice and cilantro. Cook for another minute.
This time, though, the amount would be much smaller – somewhere in the $10 million range – in hopes that voters are more willing to support the measure.

"Frail" isn't a word Carol Rhodes, 77, a retired nurse practitioner in rural Benton, Ky., would use to describe how she feels behind the wheel of her red 2001 Dodge Ram truck. Last December, she took her 17-year-old great-grandson, Dylan, on a 5,000-mile road trip from her home near Paducah to Texas, then on to Phoenix, where she has a daughter, and then back home via St. Joseph, Mo., where she has a grandson. The truck is "fabulous to drive, because you are up so high that you see everything," Ms. Rhodes says. "And if you see a 77-year-old woman in a bright-red one-ton dually coming at you, you hit the brakes!"
Also on Tuesday, Auditor Dave Yost's office was preparing to release several emails from Bennett to Yost, which Bennett sent as an unpaid advisor to the state auditor on the legislative map-drawing process.
At least 30 days back I noted the price for a grande mocha frappuccino at the Pacific Manor Safeway Starbucks (Safeway Manor) kiosk was 20 cents more then that same drink, same size at the Linda Mar Safeway (Safeway Linda Mar) Starbucks kiosk. The calories however and alas, remained unchanged — 400. The pricing differences between the two same-town kiosks did not end there. At Safeway Manor, a caramel frappuccino in sizes tall, grande and venti, sold for $4.00, $4.50 and $5.00, respectively. Same drink and sizes at Safeway Linda Mar price that drink at $3.80, $4.30 and $4.80. A tall coffee frappuccino at Safeway Manor showed a price tag of $3.30 and that same drink at Safeway Linda Mar, $3.05, a 25 cent difference. In fact every frappuccino at Safeway Manor showed a price hike over Safeway Linda Mar. Then there are the smoothies. $4.00 will get you a grande smoothie at the Safeway in the southern end of town. But for the northerly-located Safeway, bring 30 more cents.
Worth about $300,000, the contracts paid for work on the 9/11 memorial being built in Liberty State Park in Jersey City, and for art components of two public construction projects. Most of the projects were not completed, and much of the money has since been returned to the state.

Purchases of foreign goods decreased by 2.7% in February, the biggest drop since February 2009, Commerce Department figures showed last month. Imports from China plunged 18% as the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday extended into early February. That slump was probably reversed in March, Edelstein said, widening the trade gap.
From the naughty Max of "Wild Things" to the foul-tempered Pierre from Sendak's bite-size "Nutshell Library" collection, parents said Sendak understood the inner world of childhood like few other writers for kids. It's a world, Forsyth said, that "I created, that I had control over, that somehow made more sense than the world seems today."
An authority spokeswoman, Malika Reed Wilkins, said Thursday evening she could not address the issue or accusations of secrecy. “We’re talking about tentative meetings and hearsay,” she said.
It was an eventful past indeed. As a Navy tugboat in World War II called the Zuni, the Tamaroa took part in four invasions and was credited with saving numerous American ships. As a Coast Guard cutter in 1956, the Tamaroa was first on the scene of the sinking ocean liner Andrea Doria, assisting in the rescue of more than 1,600 people.

This is a tale of two Silicon Valley startups, one classic and one quirky.
Increased demands on other municipal services would also create a demand for expanding the size of the township workforce. Just like everything else, that would come at a high price tag. So while we need to keep the township affordable for our children by keeping the minimum lot sizes smaller; we cannot have them so small that mass development comes to town. The heat may very well be applied by both sides of the argument, but the planning board must find the happy medium and come up with a logical lot size.

No one should have told Juan to contact Utell. Roping in Utell, which offers reservations services to travel agents, is like telling someone with a complaint about a restaurant meal to contact the food wholesaler. This should have been handled between your husband's hotel, your travel agent and you.

Joseph Cherry Jr. was described as a pillar of Penns Grove.
Because countries are recovering from the severe global recession at different speeds, tensions among nations have risen, making it harder to find global solutions to global problems, Bernanke said.

The savings represent about one-third of the $2.5 billion the state expects to pay in employee medical costs this year, Pratt said. They would also dwarf initial estimates of a proposal by Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester), who wants contributions to be based on salary.
"There are really no words," Abby Wambach said. "We were so close."
The other news is about the departed Evergreen Country Club at the southwest corner of 91st and Western in Evergreen Park. Its 2010 sale to shopping center developer Sterling Bay Cos., which paid $7.5 million, brought laments from area residents who figured a golf club is a nicer neighbor than another expanse of pavement.
A Victorian & Steampunk Affair: District VII Detroit will be home for another Victorian & Steampunk Affair on Saturday. Guests at these events usually wear clothes from the Victorian era mixed with accessories like metallic masks and goggles that are borrowed from science fiction and technology.

The documents, which date from September 2006 to April 2011, were declassified by U.S. intelligence officials and posted by scholars at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. As part of the declassification process, intelligence officials would have withheld any documents that they felt could inflame anti-American sentiment -- another reason the documents offer a largely sanitized version.

I've just spent two days in the Silver Bank, where pretty much every whale in the Atlantic converges once a year. It's about 600 miles off the Dominican Republic. I was swimming with these magnificent creatures. The babies come up and play with you—it's definitely one of the 20 wonders of my life. I think we're going to send my catamaran there in March and April of every year and share the experience with other people.
Vowing to match "actions with actions," the U.S. will send an ambassador to Myanmar and is studying additional steps it can take to support reforms in the country, whose government over the past year has legalized the main opposition party and loosened restrictions on media and unions.

A better comparison is to Boston's Zdeno Chara and Chicago's Duncan Keith. Chara, 35, made $8.5 million last season, in what was the first year of a seven-year deal worth $45.5 million (that's a cap hit of nearly $7 million). Keith, a 28-year-old Michigan State alumnus, made $8 million last season and will make the same each of the next two seasons. His deal is 13 years at $72 million, with a cap hit of about $5.5 million per year.
His 36-yard keeper kicked the drive into gear. Barner capped it with a 5-yard scoring run as the Ducks took an 11-point lead.
It is typical that as school districts are forced to recommend reductions, advocates often communicate concerns to administration and leadership that those specific programs or staffs are not being valued. This is understandable, but this year is anything but typical. We all value a comprehensive K-12 education system that allows ample opportunities for students to become college- and career-ready. Unfortunately, our current staffing model exceeds our revenue, and it has for several years. Consequences of past, pure-intentioned budget decisions now must be rectified by adopting a staffing model that matches our revenue and is sustainable.
Brut: The common term for a fully dry Champagne or sparkling wine. Typically, it describes a wine with less than 15 grams per liter of sugar left in the final wine. However, a wine with 5 grams per liter is very different than one with 14, much as a recipe with 1 cup of sugar would taste different than one with 3. And other factors in the wine - the acidity level, the blend of fruit, the aging time - can further impact perceived dryness.
Corah advised caution while cooking.
Also participating are Clackamas County police officers, firefighters and the Clackamas County Fire District's Drum and Bagpipe Honor Guard.

What will you find inside? “Basically, it was me, my brother (and) my father who renovated the bar. We renovated the whole bar with 125 year-old red oak wood from an Amish Barn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When we first went to Kearny, there were no other bars that had microbrews. We pretty much brought, like an Irish version of an Irish bar. We transform the bar on the weekend. We put the pool table away and we have live bands.

That's a lot of outrage.
Years ago, amid geologists' predictions that they were sitting atop a vast, untapped wealth of natural gas, hundreds of landowners in Garrett and Allegany counties eagerly signed leases to allow wells to be drilled on their land and to receive royalties on any gas found there. But some who were among the last to sign say they felt pressured to do so and misled about the risks of the hydraulic fracturing technique that would be used to extract gas from rock formations thousands of feet below their homes.

In fact, the Supreme Court has routinely overturned federal laws that are not based on an enumerated power. Their circular logic continues in the assertion that the Wickard decision applies equally to inactivity as well as activity, since the act of electing not to do something is itself an activity. By this logic there is no activity that can't be regulated — since refusing to eat broccoli is, under their definition, an activity.

Season recap: Empire's post-season quest almost ended before the midway point of the season, as the team got off to a 5-11 start and lost six in a row at one point. Nobody expected Empire to rebound. This was a school known more for its good grades and laptop-filled school than its baseball acumen. But the baseball team regrouped and won nine of its final 10 regular season games. But a disappointing showing in its region tournament left Empire with a No. 11 seed in the Class 3A tournament. Empire rebounded again, upsetting its first three tournament opponents on its way to the state championship game. Empire lost the final 8-2 to Chino Valley, but Empire became the first team from its school to reach a state championship game. Empire finished its season with a 17-15 record.
for me. There was the original printing of the Bonfire of the Vanities excerpt that ran in Rolling Stone. The full page spread of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," complete with the cover that had the following byline: Raoul Duke. Near it was an original manuscript for Las Vegas, complete with typos and x'd out lines, like one about a bunch of manta rays. And by that was a letter from editor Jann Wenner telling author Hunter S. Thompson that the slipshod design of his articles and errors slipping through the editing process were because he blew through deadline like so pill bottles.
