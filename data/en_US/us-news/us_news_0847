Offense is simply not for him.
An Army report last year found that many attempted suicides are not even reported because they don't meet the criteria for being included in the Defense Department's database.

5) Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses -- Based on the horror movie by the filmmaker and rock star, the 3-D maze features a walk through the Firefly family residence, Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen, and Dr. Satan's lair. The only returning maze from last year remains a crazy-mad fun-filled experience even if the "scareactors" were a bit sparse in the first half of the attraction. I encountered only one great scare but still had a good time. It says a lot about the quality of this year's mazes that House of 1000 Corpses was my favorite from 2010 and remains just as good this year.

GOP sneak attack update. A month or so back, Republican Assemblyman Chuck DeVore of Irvine had - unbeknownst to him, as it turned out - let me in on his political strategy for "eff-ing" with the Democrats, as he put it. Speaking at Chapman, he'd disclosed his plan behind a bill he'd authored to give a five-year "holiday" to the state's tough environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act. This exemption from CEQA would apply only to inner-city infill development projects, low-income housing and farm-worker housing.

Saint Louis is led by Brian Conklin, who scores 14 points a game primarily from the post. He also gets 4.7 rebounds a game. Conklin is 6-6 with versatility not unlike Draymond Green. Alongside Conklin are 6-11 Rob Loe, a big who can step out and hit the three, and Dwayne Evans, a 6-5 bruiser who can get to the basket. Certainly Saint Louis has more size than LIU did, but the Billikens don't have the skill to compete with MSU down low, either. Adreian Payne and Derrick Nix and Green combined to score 58 points against LIU. They are playing as well as they have all season.

The bookkeeping move brought Zatik a big financial benefit, despite a $15,000 cut in salary after being rehired. By retiring, she could start collecting well over $100,000 a year in retirement payments from the state in addition to her $158,000 superintendent's pay. Thanks to a state retirement system that allows retirement at a young age, Zatik can collect both a paycheck and her retirement payments for 12 years before she hits the standard retirement age of 65.

Austen's novels: "Pride and Prejudice" is usually considered Austen's apex, and the editors of the American Book Review rated its opening line ("It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.") as the second best of any novel, after Moby Dick's "Call me Ishmael." There are many editions of Austen's books. My wife's favorites are the Broadview Literary Texts. Each has a nice and thankfully short analysis that puts the books in their historic and cultural context (without boring the reader before they even start the actual fiction).

The stakes are big. The Washington County Coordinating Committee, a group composed of mayors of the 13 cities and county Commissioner Roy Rogers, is charged with developing a 5-year list of projects totaling $175 million -- an average of $35 million per year -- that will be forwarded to the county commissioners for approval in May or June. MSTIP projects are paid for from existing property tax revenues, the result of a unique funding mechanism that began 25 years ago, with a series of three serial levies that voters later rolled into the county's fixed tax rate in the late 1990s.

2. Disregard the season series, won by the Kings 2-1-1. Hitchcock and the Blues were 1-0-1 against the Kings after Sutter took over as coach. Injuries reduced the Blues' firepower; Andy McDonald missed all four games vs. LA, and Alex Steen and David Perron each missed two of the four. The Blues never had Perron and Steen in the same lineup for any of the four games. Perron missed the first two games vs. LA; Steen missed the last two. This could be significant because McDonald (0.47), Perron (0.35) and Steen (0.33) had the best goals-per-game rate among Blues forwards.

3. All players would be paid a salary, whatever the market would bear. Players would no longer receive scholarships. Just as in the pros, they would be paid based on their perceived value to their program. If an outstanding high school player is coveted, he should be allowed to experience the fruits of American capitalism. Prominent high school players entering college are no different than prominent college players entering the NFL — they can bring excitement and new revenue to a program. No one, for instance, can deny the excitement, revenue and attention that Bush brought to USC. The players would pay income taxes; the football corporations would pay Social Security taxes; 401(k) plans could be established.

Our property tax system is Balkanized by incentives. We offer tax relief for new development or long-time homeowners. We offer credits to low-income or elderly residents.

The most welcome potential addition might be a veteran offensive lineman, particularly one who can play guard.

For all the attention "Portlandia" received in its first season, however, the most important question had yet to be answered: How would Season 2 rate in terms of quality? The initial run of "Portlandia," in 2011, was only six episodes. Season 2, by contrast, offered 10 episodes. Would Armisen, Brownstein and their co-creator and director, Jonathan Krisel, have enough material to justify 10 weeks' worth of gentle digs at the self-important, self-impressed, self-conscious and self-satisfied urban types the show made its name satirizing?
One provision fraught with the potential for mischief involves food samples offered to the public.

The wide-ranging menu at the restaurant that opened in 2008 is equally impressive. Starters include wonderfully crisp samosas -- flaky shells stuffed with potatoes, peas and spices -- and a long list of breads. The naan was perfectly cooked, crisp at the edges and oven-soft inside. The restaurant also serves garlic-spiced naan and plump, savory Peshwari naan, filled with homemade paneer (cheese), nuts and raisins. The matar paneer entree also showcased Cuisine's delicately flavored cheese, served with peas in a rich curry sauce. Like all dishes, it can be ordered on a hotness scale from 1 to 10. On the nonvegetarian front, the mughlai biryani was a savory mix of rice, tender cubed chicken, fresh spices, cashews, sauteed onions and egg. Ordered at a level 4, the spices complemented but didn't overwhelm the meat and rice. Equally nuanced was the fresh carrot halwa dessert, a mix of grated carrots, sugar and cheese. Creamy chai recommended by owner Al Parikh -- a charmingly informative host -- was a sweet but not sugary end to the evening.

While the sputnik lighting fixture has been reimagined again and again, its aesthetic has remained the same. The fixture's dazzle has a knack for kicking up the modern vibe in rooms.

This perfectly glitzy, dramatized version - in polished nickel or brass - features varying sizes of bright crystal lights wrapped in crown-like casings. It measures 33 1/2 inches wide and 21 inches long with a 60-inch drop.
“Nothing happens that they don’t completely believe,” former 49ers quarterback Steve Young said. “That’s an amazing statement for a player to talk about a head coach that way, completely authentic.

It was the latest example of how the NJEA has long flexed its political muscle. But it was far from the first. One of the most expensive demonstrations of the union’s clout came in the summer of 2008, as Corzine was preparing to run for re-election. After the Legislature adopted controversial pension reforms over the objections of the NJEA and other public-workers unions, Corzine intentionally held off on enacting the package because the NJEA insisted it needed more time to notify its members.
The takeaway: Bob Knight's son, Pat, will make his first NCAA appearance as a head coach after guiding Lamar to its first 20-win campaign since 1988. Knight ripped his seniors after a loss to Stephen F. Austin on Feb. 22, saying they were "stealing money by being on scholarship." The Cards have won six in a row since the tirade. "I thought they were tough enough to take it," Knight said. "If I had a team full of soft kids, or freshmen, if I was coaching at a big school, there'd be no way I'd get away with it. I'd have a revolt." The 23 victories are the most since the 1983-84 squad went 26-5.

Then-President Pervez Musharraf pardoned Mr. Kahn in 2004.

While Matheny's description of what should have happened stopped at "different," his team did offer a hint during spring training. Four times during exhibition play, the Cardinals pulled off a delayed double steal that involved a swipe of home. Each time, the runner at third broke on the throw to second.

The secretary of state’s office certified the payday loan reform initiative in August. Opponents had 10 days to legally challenge it. State law says such challenges “shall be placed at the top of the civil docket.” And yet it took seven months for the judge to announce a decision, which has the potential to wipe out all of the hard work of citizen volunteers and leave them no time to recoup.

Whereas in the Windows world, the consumer has nigh-infinite options. Lenovo's pre-announced a budget $850 model (the T430u). It's competing against no shortage of superb midrange Windows notebooks that deliver way more features at that same price, and many compact notebooks that cost hundreds of dollars less and (thanks to their thicker forms) can run even longer on battery. The danger is that Ultrabooks will only appeal to people who have truly and fully bought into the concept . . . whereas Mac users buy Airs simply because they wanted a notebook.
Morton was the toughest pitcher to homer against in the majors last season, allowing just six in 171 2-3 innings, with five by left-handed hitters.

It’s not clear exactly how helicopter rides translate into better outcomes for patients. Certainly one possibility is that patients get to the hospital faster when they travel by air. But patients may also benefit from getting more procedures in a helicopter or being treated by a crew that includes more physicians and nurses instead of emergency medical technicians, the researchers wrote.

As a casting director, I like to say I organize the process. We offer general auditions, and people can send their headshot and resume to me. We file people into type and category depending on their skills. We're looking for someone who can sing, act, dance and even play an instrument, or some combination any of those talents. My job as the casting director is to be able to take a number of actors for a specific role and recommend them all to a director, providing him with strong talent and many options for the roles available; I need to have an open mind about my chosen candidates whereas it's the director's duty to choose only one person for each part. I schedule appointments with every potential candidate and also organize the audition schedules for the director and the choreographer. Then, for two to three days, we see all those people. Once choices are made, I follow-up with each individual and, if they were chosen, offer them the role. The official contracts are handled by our administrative crew. On opening night, I feel privileged that I was part of the 'birthing' of the show.

The bizarre illness, first recognized in the mid-1990s, has been cloaked in controversy. Now, however, studies are reinforcing the belief that some psychiatric illnesses can be triggered by ordinary infections and the body's immune response.

Having watched Judd in her new TV series “Missing,” I noticed that her face and her figure were a bit fuller than they had been and assumed that she had gained weight. She probably didn’t mean to. If you’re signing up for a TV or movie character that requires weight gain, you alert the media in advance so everyone knows this falling off of perfection was deliberate and for your craft. She didn’t do that.

With West Virginia out of the picture (and the Scarlet Knight’s 17 game losing streak to them), Rutgers and Louisville will most likely be the media favorites. Rutgers will get Louisville at home and essentially replaces a trip to Morgantown with a trip to Yankee Stadium - where as the road team Scarlet Knight fans will outnumber Orangemen fans. At worse the game is at the Carrier Dome, still friendlier than Milan Puskar Stadium for Rutgers. But expect the Yankees to jump all over this, and quite frankly I don’t think Syracuse would mine. Besides the money coming from the Steinbrenner’s Syracuse will have an opportunity to create a buzz for themselves in the New York City, ahead bolting for the ACC the following year. The game at Yankee Satdium will also give Rutgers fans who are used to seven home games a year, a seventh chance to catch the team in the immediate area. Most importantly, for Rutgers if they had to play a team twice you could do worse than Syracuse, especially if Louisville gets stuck playing Cincinnati twice.
Abbott, based in North Chicago, Ill., earned $1.4 billion, or 92 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, down from $1.54 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.

Mindless Behavior's co-manager, Keisha Gamble of Conjunction Entertainment, and the company's chief executive, Walter W. Millsap III, saw a void in the R&B market after B2K (a disciple of the 1980s sensation New Edition) fell out of fashion more than a decade ago. So along with Streamline Records head Vincent Herbert, they auditioned teens for the new group. "It had been 10 years since there had been a boy band that catered to the urban community," said Gamble. "Little girls want something to latch on to. There's only been Justin Bieber, so it was perfect timing for something like this to come along." Mindless Behavior, whose debut came out in September, is the only band of the bunch whose members are all African American.

Those standards, while expected to be similar, will be written separately.
"The present scenario where the government's machinery is almost silent on the health status of our president is very unfortunate and ought not to continue," Muluzi said at a press conference at his home in Blantyre, Malawi's commercial hub.

At this time of the year, it's good to remember that we've always been entertained by the monstrous. Get somebody onstage, or on screen, who is frightening, revolting, or just plain transgressive, and people are bound to be enthralled. That worked for Alice Cooper, it worked for N.W.A. and Eminem, and now it's working for Odd Future. At this time last year, few were privy to the music made by the Southern California collective; twelve months later, high-profile handwringing by Internet pundits and a landslide of intriguing releases has made Odd Future hip-hop's latest hot-button issue. On Thursday night in Montclair, the latest scourge of the moral majority kept a multi-racial, mixed-gender, and very young Wellmont Theater crowd bopping (and often moshing) for an hour and a half to cartoonishly aggressive rhymes about arson, rape, murder, weed-smoking, and general depravity. The world did not come crashing down, the suburbs are still leafy, and a rowdy, profane, ultimately harmless good time was had by all.
