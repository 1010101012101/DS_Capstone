Although he's yielded two or fewer goals in seven of his past eight starts, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner is only three weeks removed from a 3-5-0 stretch during which he posted a .842 save percentage and a 4.06 goals-against average.

14. Charl Schwartzel, South Africa -- Having played and traveled almost non-stop on the European Tour and the PGA Tour since the beginning of the year, Schwartzel is taking a month-long break at home with his family in South Africa. In his second season as a full-time member of the U.S. Tour, he will return in two weeks for the Players Championship, in which he tied for 26th last year coming off his victory in the Masters. … Even though he has yet to win in 2012, Charl has played solid golf in his 10 events this season, posting four finishes in the top 10 and six in the top 20. His worst results came leading up to and including his defense of his title at Augusta National, where he tied for 50th after missing the cut in the Transitions Championship and the Shell Houston Open. Now that his year as reigning Masters champion, and being a first-time major winner, is over, perhaps he can relax and get back to playing his best golf. … Schwartzel began the next phase of career by finishing solo sixth at the Maybank Malaysian Open the week after the Masters and is looking forward to the rest of the season, especially the majors. Last year after winning at Augusta, showed that victory was no fluke when he tied for ninth in the U.S. Open at Congressional, tied for 16th in the Open Championship at Royal St. George's and tied for 12th in the PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club.

Later inhabitants noted a peculiar energy attributed to a combination of wind, 8,000-foot altitude and an enormous aquifer beneath the highest high desert outside of Tibet.

Men and women can have coronary artery disease in which those main, large arteries are plugged up by fatty, athlerosclerotic plaques.

Volunteers make and distribute the water filters, and help to educate the locals about the importance of clean water.
There is no argument that haute couture is supremely beautiful. To think of it as the apex of modernity, however, goes against conventional wisdom. In fact, for several years, haute couture has been repeatedly declared on the brink of extinction. But perhaps reports of its death were premature. The strictly governed French craft of handmade and custom-fitted clothing, which is more than a century old, is undergoing a renaissance. In the past few years, six new labels have been awarded the official haute couture designation and entered the fray, bringing the total number of couture houses to 12. Long-established couturiers like Chanel and Valentino are reporting healthy sales. And new customers from emerging markets like China, Brazil, the Middle East and Russia have stepped in to bolster the ranks of the fading old guard.

The freeing of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar and other political developments are likely to increase tourism there. "There was effectively a tourism boycott," says Robert Reid, the U.S. travel editor for Lonely Planet, because of Suu Kyi's on-again-off-again house arrest for the last 20 years. After Suu Kyi's release in November, her political party, the National League for Democracy, began encouraging individual travelers to return to Myanmar. The National League still frowns on package tours, says Reid, which it perceives as cooperating with — and thereby helping fund — the military government.

Tonia Jenkins, Davenport's mother, said she had to hear the story a few times from the other kids to believe it.
Hu cooks loads of incredible choices for vegetarians. That's because it's common practice for the many Shanghainese who follow Buddhist traditions to eat only vegetarian dishes several days every month. Still, even for the committed, a dish called noodle soup with vegetables sounds less than thrilling. Not so. Alongside spaghetti-like wheat noodles in a crystalline broth comes an ample bowl of meaty black mushrooms the size of burger patties and silky-tender bamboo shoots glimmering under a veil of lightly caramelized brown sauce. The separately served topping and noodles are easier to share than most single-bowl Asian pastas, a thoughtful touch.
Something in the back of my mind said there was a connection to Foothill College in Los Altos -- perhaps we'd toured some campus museum or point of interest? I know I was there, too, but it's all just a vague memory, like a dream sequence in "Dreamscape" (1984) which was just like "Inception" (2010) only with Eddie Albert instead of Leo DiCaprio. I'd surely think I was the "One" who "Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) and smacked into a tree and made it all up -- if it weren't for this photo.
In 1859, Mother Caroline Friess, then the 35-year-old superior of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, assumed a debt of almost $1,500 to create Immaculate Conception Academy, the first Catholic girls' school in Belleville. For paying the shortfall from local donations, the missionary from Germany gained use of the building for free.
At the start of the second half Saturday, Craft, on his way to his first career double double in points and assists, scored seven straight points on a jumper and then two layups and a free throw. That was only picking up where he left off with a driving layup at the end of the first half. He used ball screens, found lanes, and finished what he started on nearly every attempt.
One that remained open was Vietnamese fusion restaurant 19 Market, which had just two customers about 6 p.m. Normally the restaurant is busy on Saturday night, but owner Hanna Pham feared that her customers were too afraid to visit because of the bad press that has surrounded Cinco de Mayo.

Hence, relocation from Phony-opolis to New York is stringently risk-reward. The guy already has as many rings (11 as a coach) as Red Auerbach, Red Holzman and Red Klotz. Hell, even disgraced former (for 10 minutes) Notre Dame coach George O’Leary couldn’t embellish that resume.
Nick has intelligence and passion to burn, but nowhere to burn it. He lives with his divorced mother and her scruffy boyfriend, loves classic foreign films, uses elevated language to confide his yearnings to a journal, feigns sophistication with charming haplessness (a casual reference to that craggy icon of American poetry, Bobby Frost) and lusts after a Lolita-like apparition named Sheeni Saunders, who is played delightfully by Portia Doubleday. Her boyfriend, Sheeni says, writes "futurist percussive poetry," and Nick agrees: "He certainly seems to have a gift for smashing ungraceful words together and deeming it a poem." From the moment Sheeni appears in Nick's life, the plot turns on his frantic efforts to follow her to the ends of California, if not the earth, and to obey her taunting injunction to be bad. To that end, Nick invents a mustachioed, Belmondo-cool alter ego, François Dillinger, who sometimes teeters on the edge of silliness. The movie teeters too, but never loses its comic poise.

All eyes are now trained on the expected conclusion today of a summit meeting in Brussels that many believe could prove pivotal in the history of both the euro and the EU, whose roots go back six decades. Leaders of the 27 member states, 17 of which use the common currency, are to thrash out an agreement proposed by France and Germany that would see at least a majority of them signing up to a closer fiscal and economic union, with strict limits on government spending and borrowing to prevent future debt crises.

HALLOWEEN, the gays' New Year's Eve. Take, for instance, the oddly named Campus Theater in the 200 block of Jones, heart of the Tenderloin, which is offering eight hours of nonstop strip teasing by what manager Steve Downard calls his "varsity squad of strippers," 11 strong men, and not a transvestite in the lot. Why Campus Theater? "Sounds wholesome," explains Downard, "and puts the emphasis on youth. All our strippers are in their early 20s. Drop in and catch the show. We're across the street from the Hung Phat Cafe" and we are no longer in Toto, Kansas. I know that's backward, but there should be a town named Toto in Kansas, considering what Dorothy and the Whizzer did for that state. Hung Phat Cafe?

Police have identified both suspects as white, while all five victims in the early Friday shootings were black. Police and the FBI cautioned that it was too early to say whether the attacks in Tulsa's predominantly black north side were racially motivated.

In the biotech age, as Big Pharma's own research-and-development efforts floundered, the companies have become increasingly reliant on smaller biotechs to develop products.

Once patents expire, those drugs can be legally produced by any company in generic form.

If you're planning to pour brut with your cheese course, the good news is that the list of cheeses to avoid is short. In my experience, stinky washed-rind cheeses such as Munster and aggressive blue cheeses like Cabrales won't do the wine any favors. But that leaves innumerable choices, so let's try to narrow them.

Another overreaching provision of the law is its requirement that all registered sex offenders wear expensive global positioning devices for life. According to the Legislative Analyst, such a step will end up costing the state tens of millions of dollars each year.

TRAIL TO VICTORY
What happened: Many blame the central bank under Alan Greenspan for keeping interest rates too low and for boosting the nation's money supply too much. This created an easy-credit environment that encouraged less-qualified home buyers. It also created a period of such low yields that many investors sought better returns in securities backed by subprime mortgages. Critics also say the central bank encouraged investors to take too much risk because of its implied help in arranging bailouts � the �moral hazard� idea. A precedent was set when the Fed helped rescue a prominent hedge fund in 1998.

A: Simply marking messages as spam may not block future mail from the same sender. You can set up a filter for that, but crafty spammers regularly change their outgoing addresses, foiling the filters and making filterers look foolish. Instead, I would advise trying a free antispam program such as Cloudmark DesktopOne (cloudmarkdesktop.com) or MailWasher (mailwasher.net), both of which work with most mail software and services, including Yahoo. They do a credible job of identifying and removing junk mail, and you can customize them by creating black lists and white lists to block or allow mail from specific senders.

DraftExpress.com: "Long-term, Harris has the potential to fit a slew of different roles at the power forward position in the NBA. He's a tireless worker from a basketball family that simply loves to be in the gym. If he refines his consistency from the perimeter, where he already has a nice base of fundamentals to work with, he could conceivably function as a stretch-four over time. With a young player who has a great head on his shoulder that can do a little bit of everything offensively like Harris, its entirely likely that the team that drafts him will be grooming him with something in mind a few years down the road, meaning the role he plays as a rookie will not be the same as the one he plays a few seasons from now."
Tuesday "was a shorter day for me, five innings is not the way any of us want to go," Moore said. "I think it's just a matter of me trusting the ball over the plate a little more.

Dahlia Lithwick reported recently in Slate on the proposed law in Virginia that, as originally written, would have made it legal to penetrate abortion-seeking women against their will by requiring a medically unnecessary transvaginal ultrasound procedure. The procedure would count as rape under state law. Del. David Englin told Ms. Lithwick that one Republican lawmaker told him that the invasive ultrasound wasn't an issue because women seeking abortions had already made the decision to be "vaginally penetrated when they got pregnant." Apparently, once women have been penetrated, all other future penetrations should be no problem, consent notwithstanding.
