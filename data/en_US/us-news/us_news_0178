Didion reviewed the "Left Behind" series by Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins and others -- the eschatological thrillers that sell by the millions to evangelical Christians -- in 2003.

They believed absolutely in the power of the telephone numbers they had at their fingertips" and realizes that "I had for most of my life shared the same core belief in my ability to control events."

One central criticism of the 9th Circuit's decision is that it was wrong for the court to substitute its decision for that of the voters. However, it is a crucial judicial role to interpret the Constitution and to remedy unjust discrimination and violations of rights. It was not impermissible judicial activism when the Supreme Court invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage, and it is equally appropriate for courts to declare unconstitutional laws rescinding the right to same-sex marriage.

Crawford is considered by many to be the Hawks' weakest link. But he has been great down the stretch, going 8-1-2 in his last 11 appearances and allowing just one goal in five of those games.

The above reasons are why I entered the Central Precinct Commanders office on the 26th of October. I entered Commander Reese's office not only as 16 year police veteran, and a 25 year military serviceman; but as an officer who has been involved in multiple traumatic incidents, one of which involved having to shoot and kill a violent subject in 2000. At first I was reluctant to enter his office, but after consulting with my wife, I came to the conclusion that it would be remiss of me as a Portland Police Officer to not make my beliefs known to not only Commander Reese, but the Officers assigned over him.

Some of the best perspective I've ever heard on the Spurs came from then-Spurs player Brent Barry, back in 2007, during the team's run to its fourth title since 1999.

Because of the NBA’s rules prohibiting comment on the lockout, King couldn’t address the subject of Deron Williams’ signing to play in Turkey during the lockout, nor could he talk about the likelihood the Nets will be able to keep Williams, who can opt to become a free agent in 2012. To this point, the team had pinned much of its marketing of the Nets in Brooklyn on the notion it would re-sign Williams, and add quality free agents that would make the team a winner as it enters its new home.

No. Wrong. We all have a gripe, coach. Every one of us who followed a single moment of this Pac-12 season. Because they're going to package up this phony first conference championship game as if it were some kind of true playoff game.

Fellowes parcels out the real action - the ship crashing into the iceberg and the ensuing chaos - among all four episodes instead of squirreling it away for the end. It's an approach, however, that works best when each episode airs separately as opposed to back to back. ABC will run the first three installments Saturday, and the upshot is they can feel a little repetitive at times. Part four airs Sunday, on the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking.

A: It's all part of the flawed premise of this season, that all that matters is the final score of the final game of the season, and that that game come in the NBA Finals. So, to a degree, that's how it's being played, that nothing matters until the final game of the NBA Finals. That's all well and good if that's how it plays out, but it sure seems like they're playing with fire.

Beyond the Beltway: It certainly doesn't go as far as laws in Ohio or Wisconsin, but a proposal to limit the bargaining ability of public employees just passed the Massachusetts House -- which is solidly controlled by Democrats. Labor leaders in the Bay State are steaming -- after all, they helped elect most of those D's -- and hoping either the state Senate or Gov. Deval Patrick hits the brakes . . . Vermont probably will try to opt out of national health care reforms -- but not in a way conservatives will like. The legislature there is close to approving a state-run, single-payer insurance program. Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin intends to sign it, then ask Washington for a waiver . . . Illinois is the latest state to consider legalizing medical marijuana -- and with surprising bipartisan legislative support, the Chicago Tribune reports. . . The retrial of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich begins Monday.
“These guys did a heck of a job of leaving their legacy,” Knight said, fighting back tears. “I don’t know. If there are people that disagree about that, they’re morons.

“Parents need to remember that they are parents and important role models for their children; they are not their children’s friends. As much as parents may want to be perceived as ‘cool,’ research and surveys of students have indicated that kids appreciate rules and function better when they know what’s expected of them. The kids I see in treatment have often expressed they wish they had had more structure from their parents, not less.”

Community outreach: Sheriff's patrol deputies and supervisors would be required to participate in at least two public meetings a year, with six meetings held in each of the sheriff's patrol districts. The agreement also would require the Sheriff's Office and a Police Community Advisory Board to present a program on the sheriff's bias-free policing policies at every high school in Maricopa County, and calls for the Sheriff's Office to hold community meetings within 30 days of crime-suppression operations.

5. In Game 4, for the first time in this series, Pujols did not have an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. The Cardinals' first baseman didn't take a swing with a runner on base at all against Randy Wolf. Pujols is 3-for-4 with two intentional walks in six plate appearances with runners in scoring position this season, and one of the biggest deterrents for pitching around Pujols is not who is behind him - it's who is on base ahead of him. Consider Game 2: Jay scored three of the five runs that Pujols drove in that evening. Protection is one thing. Prevention is also important. Enter Rafael Furcal. A Brewers slayer in the regular season, Furcal has vanished in this series. He went hitless in five at-bats on Thursday, and he's batting .167 in the series. Furcal has walked only once to up his on-base percentage to .211. That's no way to ignite and offense and it's a good recipe to give Brewers the ability to avoid Pujols, or limit his impact. The bottom of the order went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position on Thursday night, but it's the top of the order that could determine if the Cardinals' offense rejoins the series tonight.
Commissioner Ilona Varga, D-Lincoln Park, defended the amendment, which covers her daughter, Laura Hint, who works for her. Hint began working for the commission before Varga was elected, and Varga said it would be unfair to force Hint out of her job.

Christie said he will make a decision after receiving input on the broader impact of a deal from a newly formed advisory commission on New Jersey's struggling sports, gaming and entertainment industries. "We need to have one single group of people who are advising the governor to say, 'Here's the set of options on Izod-Pru, but here's what each one of these decisions, the ramifications they may have for other things we want to do with the sports authority, with the Meadowlands complex, and with other entertainment options we have in the state,'" Christie said. "My criticism is that in the past, these things have been dealt with by different people in a siloed way, not having that type of interrelation."
As the prospects of a shale gas boom come to light, Conny illustrates one of the enduring lessons from the gold rush days. It was not the miners who struck it rich, but the folks who sold them the shovels.

And turkey has its advantages over other meats: It's lean, healthy and cheap.

More damning still, the BMI calculation was rigged by its Belgian inventor, mathematician Adolphe Quetelet, to fit existing data on 19th century Europeans. The formula, say experts, fails to take into account a patient’s level of physical fitness or the ratio of fat to muscle and bone in his body -- both factors known to influence health. Finally, the BMI lulls modern physicians into thinking they need no better measure of an individual patient’s health prospects.

I was a devout Catholic, and all of those things have conspired to make me feel like this.

He also criticized the unevenness of the mayor's proposed cuts, which favor the fire and water bureaus while trimming police and environmental services.
What Nash can do will go a long way toward deciding how much of a push the Suns can put on Houston and Denver, who play a rematch of Sunday night's game on Monday night. Nash strained his right hip Wednesday night at Memphis but did not feel the discomfort until he had gone to bed in Houston that night. The Suns athletic trainers readied him to play Friday, when he said he "struggled" through the win. It was the back-to-back that got the better of him when he lasted just six minutes in Saturday night's loss at San Antonio.

That term could also be applied to the Knicks’ outlook against the Heat now that the dysfunctional franchise, according to sources, does not expect Stoudemire to return to the series, which the Knicks trail 2-0."

Following through on this idea has proved promising but frustratingly slow. The city and PG&E officials have met for months to discuss an agreement, but nothing has happened yet.

"When you talk about how marvelous your party's economic plan is, when you break down the numbers, what you're really saying is you want to pass massive new tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires paid for them by gutting programs that, among other things, support low-income women and children and pregnant mothers and student aid for disproportion -- that disproportionately helps young women," he said.

4. Young gun Blaine Gabbert is the third first- or second-year quarterback faced by the Browns this season. Let's see how the Browns' defense has fared: Cincinnati rookie Andy Dalton left the season opener after an injury in the first half. He threw for 81 yards and one touchdown, but departed with the Bengals behind, 14-13. St. Louis' Sam Bradford didn't light up the Browns, throwing for only 155 yards and one TD. But both those teams ultimately won. On the Browns' home field, to boot.

City Manager Carol Jacobs told us the city "laid off" one part-time and five full-time city workers in July 2011 and five full-time, six part-time and seven parks-and-recreation commissioners in April 2012. That left 34 employees, full-time and part-time. According to the city's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, that's down from 44 in 2011; and from 47 from 2007-09. But the current staffing of 34 employees is just below the 36.5 in 2002.

Wash out the palm trees, half visible beyond the tap dancing platform. Palm trees are here, but they are all phonies, planted by people bemused with the notion of a sub-tropical climate, and they are so out of harmony with their surroundings that they hardly arrest your notice. Wash out the movie palazzos, so impressive in the photographs. They are here too, at any rate in a place called Beverly Hills, not far from Hollywood; but they are like the palm trees, so implausible in their surroundings that they take on the lifelessness of movie sets. Above all, wash out the cool green that seems to be the main feature of all illustrations got out by railroads. Wash that out and keep it out.

Like Russo, Dimora got his first significant scrutiny from The Plain Dealer in 1992, when he ran for county commissioner for the first time. Former Plain Dealer reporters John Long and Steve Luttner wrote a lengthy piece about the political machine Dimora had built over 11 years as the mayor of Bedford Heights. The federal corruption charges against him this summer echoed their 1992 story, which revealed how his employees had raised thousands of campaign dollars, how his office had mixed fundraising with city business and bought more than $200,000 worth of city vehicles from Dimora's father-in-law, and how he'd appointed friends to positions of debatable worth to the public.

A roulade of chicken filled with tarragon and mustard butter is rolled, poached and then seared in the flavored butter to form a crust. The medallions are fanned on the plate next to a tight knob of savoy cabbage and a square of confit legs cooked in a terrine so it has an almost bread pudding-like texture before it's unmolded, cut into squares and quickly sauteed. The dish is then completed with a quenelle of mustard mascarpone, tiny mustard greens and a thin line of foie gras veloute, adding subtle richness and complexity to the blend.
