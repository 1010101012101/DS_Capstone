Spinach and artichoke dip sounds like it should be a virtuous treat. After all, it's loaded with vegetables. Trouble is, the mayonnaise and cheese usually outweigh the spinach and artichoke.
But it turns out the little voice that tells some of the most unlikely people, "You know, you could be elected president," was telling Santorum the truth. For the moment, he is leading Romney in Romney's native state of Michigan, though the gap is narrowing. So the media are only now discovering that Santorum is more than just another ugly face. Metaphorically, that is: Physically, he is boyishly pleasant-looking, though not handsome in the Romney central-casting way. Frankly, he looks less like a president than any of his remaining Republican rivals. The coating of gravitas that automatically gets applied to those who hold the job will have to be applied especially thick if Santorum should win.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires every American to buy government-approved health insurance or face fines of up to $695 or 2.5 percent of his or her income.

We had heard from avid Potter-ites that the park is true to the movies, and more importantly, the books. We were not disappointed. It helped that our first day at the park was a rainy one, adding to the magical atmosphere. A replica of the Hogwarts Express train welcomes visitors as they step through the iron gates into the narrow alleys of Hogsmeade, where the butterbeer flows (it's super-sweet) and the shop windows overflow with whimsical details.
At the council work session May 1, Ferraro was joined by dozens of speakers and well over 100 supporters from the mountain biking community, all of whom urged the council to adopt the resolution and end the city's strict actions against bikers at the reservoir.

“Our City is mourning the loss of one of its native daughters and one of music’s shining stars. Whitney Houston inspired so many people, and although she went from a Newark church to the global stage, she always remained a deep part of our city’s pride and collective heart. Our prayers continue to be with her family during this difficult time,” he said in a statement.
In the years that followed the 1987 games, this city's Downtown was reborn, White River State Park blossomed, a major university bore fruit on the western edge of Downtown, and playing host to major events -- from NCAA Final Fours to the Super Bowl -- became all but routine for Indianapolis.
I like Rob Bell and I think we could be very good friends despite our disagreement on this issue. I'm always an advocate for thoughtful conversations about important issues over demonizing. Everyone believes what they believe for a reason. It's just a matter of whether those beliefs will be substantiated in the marketplace of ideas. Jesus was right here too, "we shall them by their fruit."
Sure, the Eagles have made it to the Super Bowl just once since 1980 and haven't won an NFL title since 1960. But Couch Slouch famously dismisses statistical evidence and depends on intellectual hunches.
"We are pleased that the Christie administration is taking this positive step to support the healthy growth and expansion of charter schools," said Carlos Perez, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Charter Schools Association. "The option of borrowing with low-cost financing will allow charter schools across the state to construct new facilities, repair dilapidated buildings, modernize classrooms and address health and safety issues."
"We also suffer together the strains caused by what has been a long pattern of state disinvestment in the University of California," he said.
Desserts from pastry chef Nichole Dezek can be just as complex as Dettmer's savory courses, despite the rustic descriptions. Angel food cake with berries ($8) was actually three snowball-like chunks of cake loosely arranged on a bed of blueberries and strawberries, with a few crumbles and two tiny scoops of tangy yogurt sherbet. It needed a sauce to bring it together, however, and the cake ended up looking like scraps. A refined opera cake ($8), flavored with chocolate and almond, resembled a giant petit four; accompaniments included horchata ice cream and chunks of marshmallow rice crisps.
The question isn't whether Oregon can push China around. Instead, it's whether the Northwest can make decisions that balance regional and national strategies to reduce coal use with shipping mountains of coal to Asian furnaces.
Many of the companies have operated call centers in Rupp's St. Charles County district. The biggest, Wentzville-based US Fidelis, filed for bankruptcy in March 2010.
"Doc at the Radar Station" (1980) and "Ice Cream for Crow" (1982), the more "user-friendly" Beefheart discs, are still adventurous recordings by anybody's standard.
“He definitely didn’t want to go back to Denver," Miller said. "But we found a way to get this win. I was just hoping that we didn’t go to overtime. (There was) too much energy in the building. A veteran team like that will fight their way back and try to finish games. We found a way to contain them and we rebounded the ball."
For more five-diamond hotels within an easy drive of Cleveland, consider the Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.; or Falling Rock at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort in southwest Pennsylvania.

Still, Bailey, The Dalles farmer, believes that health reform was badly needed and that providing coverage for workers is good for business. "We look at it as getting better, more productive workers who stick around," he said. "But for many farmers who haven't provided coverage, it will be a new cost."
Take, for example, the issue of equal pay. The first legislation that Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which reversed a 2007 Supreme Court decision that made it harder for women to bring lawsuits about pay discrimination. (The court said that Ledbetter had waited too long to complain that she had consistently received smaller raises than her male counterparts, even though she hadn't known of the pay disparity.)

Michael Buckner, a lawyer in Florida who has represented universities and coaches in cases involving the NCAA, said that in many cases, the NCAA will receive an allegation regarding an institution and "conduct a preliminary investigation to gather as many facts as they possibly can."

The front room features a gorgeous blue peacock spreading its wings across one wall, while murals of plush Indian scenes detail the other walls. The back room, called the Fantasy Room, comes complete with tented private booths and low tables with plush cushions.

The two institutions started co-admitting students in winter 2001 after statewide research on enrollment patterns showed students were enrolling in multiple schools on their own without the benefit of a structured degree pathway – a trend called "swirling." The agreement gives those students more coordinated support to meet their educational needs. The new agreement establishes application deadlines, allows students to apply online and opens PSU housing to co-admitted students on a space available basis.
Solution: A healthy and productive season by Ubaldo Jimenez would go a long way to improve a rotation that ranked 10th in the AL in ERA (4.51) and innings pitched (961 1/3). Justin Masterson and Josh Tomlin must build on their 12-win season from 2011 and Lowe cannot resemble the 17-game loser from Atlanta. Hernandez, Slowey, Jeanmar Gomez, Zach McAllister, David Huff and Scott Barnes should give Acta enough arms to cover the fifth spot.

The authority provides bus service to mountain towns and ski resorts in the Roaring Fork Valley, including Aspen and Glenwood Springs. Yet the agency has been unable to afford to build garages for most of its buses. With temperatures often dropping into the teens at night, workers have to start up buses at 2 a.m. each morning in order to warm them up before the first get out on the road two hours later. It wastes fuel, cost money and is hard on bus engines, Blakenship said.
Nowinski talked to insurance brokers, but by the end of 2008, he couldn't find anyone to insure him, Stacia Nowinski said. By July, the stress of always being sick was too much for Nowinski and he took his life, she said.
Of the 16-person ensemble, it’s the plus-size members who make the biggest impressions. Carly Jibson, a onetime Tracy Turnblad in Broadway’s “Hairspray,” is particularly fine as bad-girl Daphne, who rejoices that the other girls’ butts are bigger than hers, as is Larry Owens as Darnell, who finally sheds his self-made man bra in a gleefully jiggly, bare-breasted number.
Late in the day, after walking out North Lamar to the bend in the road where old Bayard dies in "Sartoris," I wound up at St. Peter's Cemetery on the northeastern side of town.

Do not prune old garden roses unless you know where to prune. Old garden roses have very individual pruning requirements. Local rose gardens and nurseries offer classes.

For the first time since the 2006-07 season, the Blazers will not play on Christmas. When they drafted Oden No. 1 overall in 2007, the Blazers became a national television draw and instantly were pitted against No. 2 pick Kevin Durant and the then-Seattle SuperSonics in a marquee Christmas game at the Rose Garden. Since, the Blazers have hosted the Dallas Mavericks and Denver Nuggets and visited the Golden State Warriors on Christmas. This season, home games against the Phoenix Suns on Dec. 23 and Clippers on Dec. 26 are sandwiched around the holiday. The Blazers also will be in town — fresh off a four-game trip — on Thanksgiving.

Luke Bryan. In any other festival line-up, he would have been the headliner. A randy, dancing, wisecracking, hit machine, Bryan is devilishly aware of his heartthrob status with the ladies and his primal resonance with the guys. Whether singing about "sitting here, waiting on a deer, wasting bullets," or telling a lady she makes his "speakers go boom-boom," Bryan had cheering fans by the tens of thousands in the palm of his hand.

Anaya said land restoration would help bring about reconciliation. He named the Black Hills as an example. He said restoring to indigenous people what they have a legitimate claim to can be done in a way that is not divisive "so that the Black Hills, for example, isn't just a reminder of the subordination and domination of indigenous peoples in that country."

Displaying lawyerly caution, Obama selected a running mate with impressive policy credentials but who carries little electoral weight. Biden has Catholic blue-collar roots but is best known as a Washington insider. Allan, just how much of a difference can he make with the voters of key states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio?

Late in the first quarter, Alan Ball tried to jump on a loose ball after the Giants’ Will Blackmon muffed a punt but it squirted out, perhaps thanks in part to the slick turf from showers that began in pregame and continued into the first half.

But if the tenor of "Mañana Forever?" occasionally veers toward the Inquisitorial, Castañeda, a frequent contributor to the L.A. Times' op-ed pages, also takes pains to brighten his dark narrative with considerable wit and humor, as in the title of his first chapter, "Why Mexicans Are Lousy at Soccer and Don't Like Skyscrapers." The answer, according to Castañeda, is that Mexican society emphasizes individual achievement and the familial unit over a broader-based collectivism and cooperation.

Finally, in 1969 synthetic crude oil from the Athabasca tar sand of Alberta, Canada, began to be produced. It has been transported without incident to U.S. refiners by pipeline for 40 years. There is now an environmental movement to prevent the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline to deliver additional tar sands crude from Alberta to the U.S. to make up for declining U.S. production. Opponents of Keystone XL won a victory this month when President Barack Obama refused to sign off on the pipeline's proposed route, forcing at least a year's delay as the project is reconfigured.

Each of us resumes his place - Dad in the cab with the TV technicians, Eduardo and I in the bed - and the truck continues swaying and lurching its way down the mountain. Eduardo and I are tossed from side to side, groaning and uttering oaths in Spanish and English. There are moments when it hardly seems far-fetched to think I could be thrown from the truck and end up stranded in deep underbrush, in the rain, in the dark, on the mountain. Yet I hear myself laughing between curses. Eduardo seems less fazed: He smokes the occasional cigarette and even answers his cellphone.

The combined state and federal share of that will be 49 percent, up from 45 percent today.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich wants the consultant to determine how much money Ohio could receive if it leases out the turnpike, and to help the state seek proposal requests from potential turnpike operators.

Does the referee really have to go over to each sideline and tell the coaches that there are two minutes left in the half? What, they can't see the stadium clock? IT'S HUGE.

Just as Britain withdrew its diplomatic staff from Iran and ordered the Iranian Embassy in London closed, the international community must make it clear that Iranian leaders are not welcome in their countries or in international forums. World leaders should not visit Tehran. While the U.S. cannot enforce these steps on other nations, we can lead by example in ostracizing Iranian officials around the world. It is abundantly evident that the regime in Iran has no interest in unclenching its fist in response to President Barack Obama's offer of an open hand.

California droughts don't occur in precise timetables or with equal severity. The only thing we know for certain during a drought is that we don't know when it will end. That's always been true, but the effects of climate change make it even harder to predict what lies ahead. Conserving as much stockpiled water as possible this summer would be the prudent and practical thing to do. Reducing use by 20 percent is a good target.

The 2012 appeals vary widely — they have concerned movies such as the action adventure "Sea Level," which tried (unsuccessfully) to nab a G rating, and a raunchy crime drama, "Killer Joe," which sought (also unsuccessfully) to be downgraded to R from the adults-only NC-17.

* Vermeil on his long association with Brian Schottenheimer, who was a member of the Rams organization in 1997: "I hired him as an intern in '97. I watched him grow. (Before coming to St. Louis) I would broadcast Kansas City Chiefs preseason games. I'd sit and have lunch with the kid in camp and I admired his passion for the game when he was just a kid going on and making a decision on where he was going to college. He's very smart. Loves the game."

As unappealing as such a question seems, it isn't out of the realm of possibilities. Obama ran against the Edwardses and knew Elizabeth. Such questions are never posed for the answer but are proffered for the express purpose of creating an awkward moment to which there really is no good answer. In other words, to trap the responder.

There was a time when the characteristics most Americans hoped for, or expected, from their elected representatives were clear: integrity, honor, courage, selflessness and an ability to put the country's interests above their own. But the approval rating of today's Congress is below 20 percent, according to a Real Clear Politics average of national polls. Ethics scandals and an overall inability to get done anything of substance erode the foundation of the institution. Meanwhile, the U.S. military's approval rating is near 80 percent, according to a Gallup report last month.
The first possible cause could be a little more difficult to remedy. I would start by plugging something else into the outlet and see if the plug is loose or jiggles when you plug it in. If the plug is loose, this can cause arcing. Arcing is when the electricity jumps from the plug to the outlet connectors inside the outlet. This happens when the plug is not seated tightly into the outlet. Arcing is usually something you can hear or see when plugging in the heater.

Departments on the West Coast are currently experimenting with the next step beyond hot-spot policing, using a computer program based on earthquake prediction technology to "predict" where crimes will happen next.

Q: My 6-year-old twins will be attending first grade this fall. They have been together through preschool and kindergarten. My mother-in-law thinks it would be best if they were in separate classrooms. My husband and I are just not sure if this is too young for them to be separated. What have other parents and even teachers experienced with this situation? What would the positives or negatives be in such a situation?

Caseworkers also face other challenges that eat up time. They must investigate reports that some argue don't belong with CPS at all. Almost every night, they are ferrying teens from juvenile detention to group homes because their parents won't pick them up. CPS also is used as a pawn in custody battles, with hotline workers taking calls from angry spouses complaining about the other parent when there's no real threat.
"And then it came out to Hollywood, where it was bastardized. Belly dancing was looked on as a form of striptease, this sexual thing. And it's really more about birth and life and storytelling. We like to let people know it's not what you saw in James Bond. It's so much more than that."
Shoemaker had also expressed concern about legal fees and other costs the county might incur in the process. Burke said the only initial cost was a $50 filing fee, and the county could decide later to abandon the case if costs for experts and others expenses become an issue.

"He was a Washington insider who managed to get somebody's attention at the top level," Durfee said. "They took our tax dollars, they turned them over to Carl DeMaio so he could come here to San Diego with literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank that he can now turn around and use for his political endeavors. … We have every reason to be upset about that and cynical of a person who is so anti-tax that when he had the opportunity to reap the benefits from those tax dollars he jumped all over it."

None of this is the fault of Cordray, who appeared to be liked personally by Shelby and Bob Corker of Tennessee, the other Republican at the committee confirmation hearing. The pair and a small group of Democrats -- seven of the 12 on the committee, although their number dwindled to two at times as lawmakers came and went -- praised Cordray's background. They admired his work ethic (his first job was flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, and he would later clerk for two U.S. Supreme Court justices). They even complimented his blond 12-year-old twins, Danny and Holly, who managed to smile through much of the hearing.

Yellow can be cheerful and uplifting, or mellow and warm. It plays well with all woods and most other colors and complements a wide range of decor styles.

But the beauty of user fees, and that's what these would be, is that you don't pay them unless you play. It makes sense to have the people who use the boardwalks and restrooms contribute more to keep them clean, safe and in good repair. Why shouldn't the people who fill up the trash cans pay a little more to have them emptied (by paid employees, using state-purchased trucks, which burn expensive gasoline, and transport the refuse to a landfill that may charge ... user fees)?

Referring to complaints from Missouri, he added: "If someone comes up to us afterward and says it needs to be run in a different way, 100 percent for flood control, and asks could we do that, the answer is yes. Would people accept bathtubs in the upper basin? Probably not."
The décor seems a bit more subdued as well. I remember the restaurant as a glitzy O.C. take on Provence, albeit created from French antiques, with even the limestone fireplace and stone doorway hauled back from Provence.
Ferguson, 43; Michael Woodhouse, 52, of West Bloomfield, and Calvin Hall, 42, of Detroit were indicted in 2010 on charges they fixed bids to help Ferguson win a nearly $12-million contract for a low-income, public housing project in Detroit.

The only program with more on-field wins was Ohio State at 66-12, though Ohio State's 12-1 record from the 2010 season was vacated by NCAA sanctions. Those NCAA issues started with several players exchanging memorabilia and cash for tattoos, continued through Tressel's unethical conduct charges for not revealing his knowledge of that situation, and increased through violations over $200 booster payments to three players and overpayment for summer jobs.
I headed to the rosé category, usually the best bet for inexpensive wines. I had to put my water down when I saw a rosé for $80. When I asked the sommelier to pick something a bit less expensive, he recommended the 2010 Château de Trinquevedel Tavel ($60).

* I'm a die-hard fan of lateral raises to strengthen the shoulders, but doing them with bent elbows really isolates the shoulder muscle and takes the strain off the neck. Start by holding light dumbbells (about 3 to 5 pounds) by your side, with elbows bent. Raise the arms, making sure the elbows and shoulders are in a straight line -- never go any higher than that. Hold that position for two seconds, then take the arms down slowly. Do three sets of 15 to 20 reps. You can do this standing or sitting, but sitting may be a little more challenging because you're less likely to use momentum to move the weights. This will take the pressure off the neck, especially if you sit at a computer all day and strain your neck trying to read the screen.

Does God create the beginning and create time when God creates the heavens and the earth? Or was something already happening before God began to create the world?

Even Steve Schmidt, the Republican operative who saved some of his reputational skin by dishing dirt on Ms. Palin once the campaign went south, still comes off as a creepy figure—and not only because the shaven-head Woody Harrelson who plays him looks like a death-row inmate. Nicolle Wallace, whose job it was to groom Ms. Palin for the big leagues, found the task both odious and impossible.

A-B InBev hopes a lot of people do, said Williams, for it has much riding on Platinum. It's their shot to bite back at spirits, to woo drinkers who have turned away from beer, to show they can produce a new product just as well as their rivals at MillerCoors.

Ohioans have a stake in this issue and not just because it affects their pocketbooks. The nominee, Richard Cordray, is the state's former attorney general, and one of the senators blocking the nomination is Ohio's Rob Portman.

Loftis was fired for having violated a school district rule requiring teachers to "conduct themselves, both in their employment and in the community, in a manner that will reflect credit upon themselves and the school system." He was also barred from obtaining a teaching certificate for five years by the Florida Department of Education. In March, the Florida Education Practices Commission reversed that order and said Loftis could obtain a teaching certificate. But local officials were quick to assure citizens that they would not have to hire Loftis even if he were certified.

This looked like a two-person race between me and Rudy Giuliani, and so far Rudy Giuliani really hasn't been able to get out of single digits I think in any one of the states, and that obviously can't speak very well about the ability his campaign has had to connect outside of, if you will, Florida and New York."

Sheriff Sandra Hutchens called them examples of the best and most tenacious officers in the department.
In its current budget debate, Congress appears poised to eliminate or reduce the program under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that paid for one-on-one mortgage-default and reverse-mortgage counseling. The money technically runs out today, the start of the fiscal 2012 federal budget year, even as the foreclosure crisis shows little sign of abating.
Another entry into the minuscule "real estate noir" category, however, might stand the best chance of opening this wonderfully byzantine world to a larger audience, largely because the author frames this world in the context of other career paths well familiar to the crime fiction reader: lawyers, journalists, and cops. "Blind Man's Alley" (Doubleday: 470 pp., $25.95) dives into the skulduggery of commercial real estate dealings with enthusiastic gusto, but it's filtered through Peacock's larger concern about the moral struggles of a cynical young associate who may not have severed the cord of idealism in the pursuit of money.
A 1956 addition, the room is a book-lover's delight: Built-in bookcases along several walls are filled with tomes.

The three remaining walking wounded -- Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul -- all avow their intentions to keep competing all the way to the convention in Tampa. They may be motivated by ego (as in Mr. Gingrich's case), movement building (as in Mr. Paul's), or (as in Mr. Santorum's) the hope of inheriting the mantle of Mr. Conservative.

As we struggled, others around us perfected their tricks. A girl hung from a hoop by her neck and spun around. A man climbed to the ceiling on a ladder of gauze. A woman practiced walking on a wire with bamboo sticks to support her.
U.S. Sens. Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar and U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison are asking President Obama to quickly issue a disaster declaration for parts of the Twin Cities area hit by a tornado last weekend.
How cool would it be to have Darth Vader as a dad? He could use the Force to pour cereal, help you with lightsaber batting practice, and take you to visit the Death Star. Artist Jeffrey Brown used this idea as a jumping-off point for his delightful book "Darth Vader and Son," $14.95, available now.
Edge of Darkness (1943): This World War II drama directed by Lewis Milestone and starring Errol Flynn doesn't take place in the area, but scenes filmed at Monterey's Fisherman's Wharf were transformed into a scenic Norwegian fishing village.
Cavanagh said he had hoped Ficano would remain neutral. But in the final weeks, when the race tightened, he said Team Ficano mobilized behind Wojtowicz, launching a barrage of appointee-operated phone banks and sending out three anti-Cavanagh mailings in the race's final days. Former appointees confirmed Cavanagh's account.

The starters all sounded good, but the bruschetta with fava beans ($7.75) caught our attention. It sounded simple but was deceptively complex -- full of garlic and spring onion flavor, but not so much as to overwhelm the sweetness of the creamy pureed favas. A thick slice of caciotta, a fresh sheep's milk cheese from Italy, lay on top with just a drizzle of truffle oil.
"Santorum just bores me to tears," she said. And "I don't like Gingrich's whole approach, the way he comes across, his personal life."
California requires developers to provide two acres of suitable tortoise habitat for every acre of habitat taken. But the scale of the solar development coming to Western deserts is so vast that it renders the formula unworkable. Not enough alternative land exists.
ARLINGTON, Va. -- Alex Ovechkin’s ice time keeps shrinking in the playoffs, all the way down to a career-low 13½ minutes in Game 2 of the Capitals’ Eastern Conference semifinal against the Rangers.
Trial and error: "Don't be afraid to experiment. Some great spaces are on their fifth incarnation because the previous four didn't work out perfectly. Move a chair or put the sofa in an unconventional area. Sometimes inspiration strikes when you make a mistake. Learning what you like can sometimes be a process of eliminating what you don't like. I move my artwork around frequently. People think I've purchased a new collection or that my taste has changed based on the placement. You'd be surprised at the reaction you get from taking the crazy piece out of the bathroom and putting it in the foyer."
TRENTON -- The state Supreme Court heard arguments today on whether politicians may use campaign money to pay for criminal trials as an "ordinary and necessary expense of holding public office."
Using a calculator from the University of Michigan's Population Studies Center and applying the 2009 estimates, Ohio is 42,753 people short of securing 17 seats in Congress instead of the projected 16.

involvement resulted in the election of conservatives such as Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky to the Senate and 87 GOP freshmen in the House of Representatives, many of them backed by Tea Party activists. Their presence on Capitol Hill has influenced debates on deficit reduction, immigration and environmental issues.
"She pulled the needle out of one of the last good veins in her left arm, pointed it towards the sky and pushed the plunger. Hard. When the clot broke through the tip of the needle it squirted out blood on the ceiling of her bedroom, up above and in between the ceiling fan blades."
"We were well on the way to being taken over by an organized criminal, political machine that stretched throughout the county," said former Commissioner Tim McCormack, who served with Dimora and once counted him as a Democratic ally. "Law enforcement had to stop it."

Now imagine how you would feel if City Hall went along with the misinformed jury and agreed to pay millions of dollars to the person convicted of the drive-by shooting in a voluntary settlement. Would you feel that your city government had your back? Would you feel that the people of Los Angeles, whom you keep safe every day, cared more about the danger to your life or the comfort and care of the felon who threatened you after shooting up a neighborhood?

A: Your plan is more than reasonable; it's good - but with a little modification. Remember that water is the enemy. Your friends are airflow and water-resistant materials. Good ventilation and using the right stuff will give you a useful and comfortable man cave.
Moscow is at the forefront of creating a "modern Russian" identity, with Russian banks alongside foreign retail stores. Sanitation is also significantly improved. City workers in orange uniforms, mostly Tajikistanis, wipe clean Metro station floors and city streets. While some Muscovites frown upon the illegal surge of poor foreigners, many see the workers as beneficial: They accept low pay and work efficiently, rendering the city a wonder for the eye.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.71, or 1.2 percent, to 914.51. The gains pushed the index higher for the year after a rally on Monday helped erase its losses from 2009.
By 2008, the school is bursting out of its space in the West Orange commercial building. Quiet instruction mixes with boisterous activities in the classrooms. Small lockers, one row stacked on another, line a side of the front hallway.
Step One: Do no harm. The governor's budget may require some tough votes, but it strikes the best balance of any proposal we've heard so far. The pension shift is overdue and allows local governments to recoup some of their costs through anticipated "piggyback" income tax revenues. Mr. O'Malley's plan to reduce (thought not eliminate) certain income tax deductions is appropriately targeted at higher earners. Those principles need to be preserved in any alternative budget plan.
"It was a back-and-forth match. We're standing back in practice laughing, like, 'Well, look at those two McCallums!' To us, it was hilarious to see, even though they were being serious. But right after that (exchange), you would have thought they had just gone out for dinner and ice cream, because they were all lovey-dovey, back to father and son."

If declared totally and permanently disabled by the military, Pyatt would immediately begin receiving his retirement pay of several hundred dollars a month. He and his family also could see private doctors and eliminate the 90-minute drives several times a month to the St. Louis VA.
Hey, Paul: I've heard the pricetag to move up for Luck would be a minimum of three No. 1s, with one this year in the top 10. If the Browns did that, they would have to certainly use their remaining early picks on a receiver and offensive lineman. They also would have to be more aggressive in free agency than they were in 2010. You'd have to say other positions of need would be running back, and depth everywhere else.
"We've been open for 13 years, and our clientele has matured," says Synnott. "So it was time the bar matured with it."
Mabbott believes the ESD virtual classes would keep more students -- and the money the state provides to educate each student -- in their home district schools. Students who leave a district for a charter school take about $5,000 in state money with them.

They include Michelle Pfeiffer and Chloe Moretz, who plays a bored teenager. An immortal witch portrayed by Eva Green threatens to destroy Collins' family if she can't have him.
Worse, it is destructive because it will further erode our economy. It is the hardworking middle class who, unlike the wealthy, fuel the economy by spending most of their incomes each paycheck. When there are fewer of them with less money to spend, our communities will suffer twice. Not only will there be fewer services delivered by fewer public employees, but local economies will suffer more revenue losses because public employees won't have the middle-class incomes to pump into the economy.

Why it's cool: Torrey hosted a U.S. Open in 2008 won in a playoff by a guy with a bum knee that had undergone surgery earlier in the year. (That would be Tiger Woods.) It's a truly public course, owned by the citizens of San Diego. A good bit of the way, players must skirt barrancas (arroyos choked with native vegetation) and Pacific headland. And it's a brute, particularly for the machismo crowd playing from tees beyond their expertise and hacking out of the Medusa's hair-like kikuyu rough.
HealthCorps aims to turn this around.

According to an annual report by the Project on Student Debt, Minnesota college students who graduated in 2010 had an average loan debt of $29,000. Nationally, student loan debt now eclipses credit card debt, with some putting the figure at $1 trillion. Some economists say the debt may be the next bubble to burst, threatening the financial future not only of students, but the credit ratings and the security of retirement funds security for parents who co-signed for loans or mortgaged their homes to send children to college.

No one will deny ASU has had a string of bad breaks in the past few months, from quarterback Steven Threet leaving football because of multiple concussions, to wide receiver T.J.

The necessity of a biological mother and father for the life of every person is the immutable reality advocates of homosexual "marriage" cannot deny. Instead, they dismiss its significance — or in Mr. Rodricks' case, ignore it altogether.
At beautiful Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, we saw our first group of mountain gorillas. After a strenuous climb, we met the Rushegura group of gorillas, headed by silverback Mwirnima, who lounged under a tree, surrounded by his "family" - several females, juveniles, and babies, wrestling, climbing trees, beating their little chests like Poppa. These gentle, humanlike creatures didn't seem to mind us staring at them just a few feet away, recording their every move with our cameras.

The union — the largest in the state representing nearly 200,000 teachers — released a television advertisement that highlighted the relationship between the bill’s architect, Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester), and the South Jersey powerbroker George Norcross to try to discredit the legislation as politically tainted.
The social gospel is not new to this president. It is largely a creation of 20th-century Protestants who believed in applying "Christian principles" to rectify society's problems. Deeds quickly supplanted faith, evolving into a "works salvation" theology, which says if you do enough good works, God will be pleased and let you into Heaven when you die. This contradicts biblical teaching that it is by faith and not works that one is saved from judgment (Ephesians 2:8-9). Some verses teach works as an extension of faith, revealing its depth and seriousness, but they equally teach that works without faith in Jesus is not enough. This is traditional Christian theology. Accept it, or not, but the president is mistaken when he interprets Scripture to achieve his political goals.

Dr. Strayer's studies have also found that talking on a cellphone is far more distracting than conversing with a passenger—since a passenger can see the same traffic hazards and doesn't expect a steady stream of conversation as someone on a cellphone does. Listening to the radio, to music or to a book on tape also isn't as distracting, because it doesn't require the same level of interaction as a conversation. But Mr. Simons notes that even drivers may miss some details of a book on tape if their attention is focused on merging or other complex driving tasks.
But when Arthur succeeded Garfield, he turned on his own faction and pushed through the civil service reform that Garfield had championed. Indeed, Millard writes, the loss of Garfield helped to reunite a nation still split by memories of the Civil War.

I was actually hoping to hear from Ron Paul. He seems quirky enough to hold a conversation, pretending for a moment that it would be him doing the calling. He even looks a tad like a March hare or a mad hatter. I think candidates should look the part they are playing.

Others are better equipped to solve this polarizing conundrum, but I bring Littell up because he attempts -- successfully or otherwise -- to tackle Nazi atrocities head-on, consciously aiming to write a great work of fiction and relegating the reader's entertainment to mere afterthought. That approach may work for a select few, but eschewing the didactic in favor of embedding the lessons of this monstrous time in history through the prism of the classic entertainment trope of a wisecracking, archly ironic private detective has served British author Philip Kerr extremely well since the three novels that constitute his "Berlin Noir" (Penguin: 836 pp., $20 paper) trilogy first appeared, between 1989 and 1991. In roughly the same number of pages, "Berlin Noir" does exactly the opposite of "The Kindly Ones" -- examining the Holocaust through the prism of what transpired before and after -- and, as a result, the trilogy (and two subsequent sequels) stands a better chance of literary permanence.
