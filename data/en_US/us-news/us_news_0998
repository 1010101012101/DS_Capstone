So I've said before that I want to look for every possible opportunity to work with Congress to move this country forward and create jobs. I'm going to look for every opportunity to try to bridge the partisan divide and get things done -- because that's what the American people need right now. And that means putting construction workers back on the jobs repairing our roads and our bridges. (Applause.) That means keeping our teachers in the classrooms. (Applause.) That means keeping our cops and firefighters doing what they do, protecting us every day. (Applause.) That means helping small businesses get ahead. (Applause.) That means serving our veterans as well as they've served us, like this young man right in the front. We are grateful for him, for his service. (Applause.)

øIn its simplest form, an immediate annuity is a contract with your insurance company. You pay the insurance company a lump sum - say, $100,000 - and the insurance company agrees to pay you a monthly amount for life.

"We're going to rely a little more on our starting rotation and our bullpen and the games are going to be a little more National League. I still feel like our offense is great. I think it's solid. But I don't think we're going to have to out-slug other teams. We're going to be able to rely on the pitching and defense."

Another key tonight will be keeping the Sharks' top-six in check. The Blues have done a good job so far, but it looks like the Sharks will be changing their top two lines tonight to spark the offense. If Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau get going, this could be a different series quickly.
But the big picture isn't clichéd or divisive. The more documentaries you see, the more you'll learn about the cataclysm of combined problems that Detroit has faced, and the city's enduring ability to survive and keep fascinating the world with its persistence.
"When you look into their eyes after something like this has happened, you know, you wonder as a coach are they mentally there," Woodson said. "And I just told them to take a deep breath and relax and let's go out and have fun and play basketball the way I think we're capable of doing it, and I think they responded."

Like any good friterie, this one offers a large selection of dipping sauces, including anchovy mayo (try it), satay sauce (interesting), ketchup with rosemary and truffle oil (move on) and -- the ultimate -- sweet-hot mustard sauce. Yes, mustard sounds strange with fries, but trust me: This homemade formula is a startlement, a nostril slapper, a game changer. If you're really flying, also try the "poutine," the Canadian soul-food combo of fries, spicy brown gravy and cheese curds. Rich doesn't begin to cover it, but neither does wonderfully evil.
Scientists see the paper as an invitation to question – are the findings true? What does it mean?
About an hour before serving, bring the beets and the lentil mixture to room temperature.

The Bengals were universally applauded for taking Alabama cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (No. 17), Wisconsin guard Kevin Zeitler (No. 27) and Penn State defensive tackle Devon Still (No. 53) with their top three. All quality prospects, to be sure. But the fawning over Rutgers receiver Mohamed Sanu (No. 83), Clemson defensive tackle Brandon Thompson (No. 93) and Georgia tight end Orson Charles (No. 116) was puzzling.

Story behind the ink: "I'm in the food business, so there is a food theme to my tattoos. I have a pan of bacon and eggs, a bunch of asparagus, a pig sectioned off into the cuts of meat, a cleaver cutting a head of garlic. I have a slab of ribs on my forearm. I love ribs. But my tattoo in progress is a tribute to BV wines. BV (Beaulieu Vineyards) is the first red wine I really fell in love with."

After a brief stay in Montreal, the Bleys moved to Los Angeles, and Paul soon started playing Carla's music. When they moved back to New York City in the early '60s, all of Paul Bley's friends, and friends of his friends, started playing Carla's music as well. "I was instantly snapped up by Paul Bley," she said, "and then by everyone he worked for — Jimmy Giuffre and George Russell — and then I started getting other musicians coming by my house and asking if I had a blues in A-flat, and I'd say sure, I've got one in A-flat. Or, 'I need a fast waltz.' OK, no problem, I've got that. And then Steve Swallow, who worked for Paul Bley, got my songs played by everybody he worked with. In those days, for some reason, a composer who wrote the way I did, which was very short and simple, was, if not in great demand, a useful person. So I never had the need to play."
Leighton, who said her family browsed Powell's Books in downtown Portland as she toured Boring homes, doesn't know if she can necessarily agree with the sentiment. As for Burtles, she wasn't quite sold on visiting her sister community just yet.
Time heals all wounds, and God forgives, but If you are Graham Spainer, Tim Curley, Joe Paterno, Gary Schultz or anybody else that possessed knowledge that this was taking place, tonight I hope you understand that as former leaders the in the field of higher education, you are considered by your colleagues to be counted among the biggest failures in the history of this profession. I hope that the victims of these horrible acts find peace and closure one day and they have the will and determination to overcome the pain and suffering they have received by the hands of a morally corrupt and disgusting human being.

Revelation of the secret prison could worsen tensions at a highly sensitive moment in Iraq. As U.S. troops are withdrawing, Maliki, a Shiite Muslim, and other political officials are negotiating the formation of a new government. Including minority Sunni Arabs is considered by many to be key to preventing a return of widespread sectarian violence. Already there has been an increase in attacks by Al Qaeda in Iraq, a Sunni extremist group.

Missouri came into the game as the second-most penalized team in the Big 12, with 43 for 356 yards. On Saturday, thanks to two penalties being declined by Iowa State, Missouri was officially assessed for no penalties.
Last year, Spain's regional and local governments were the chief cause of the country's failure to meet its budget-deficit target of 6% of gross domestic product. Under terms of new spending regulations, the central government can now intervene in the financial management of regions unable to meet budget targets. The government has already rejected a draft budget presented by the left-leaning government of Andalusia—Spain's most populous region and one of the poorest—on grounds that it didn't implement deep enough cuts."Public administrations are not employment offices," Spain's Budget Minister Cristóbal Montoro said in March.

ACLU legislative counsel Michelle Richardson, reacting to the introduction of McCain's bill, stated that parts of the bill permitting extensive sharing were "a privacy nightmare that will eventually result in the military substantially monitoring the domestic, civilian Internet." The Center for Democracy & Technology has raised the same concerns about the Lieberman bill, as that bill would permit the Homeland Security to designate a military agency to take the lead on cybersecurity.

Don't get me wrong. I love it hot. I'm outside writing in my backyard, which is wireless thanks to the generosity of my next-door neighbor's router, and it's already well past 90 degrees.

LONDON (AP) — Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish sees Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea as more than just an opportunity to compensate for his team's dismal Premier League season.
Although some people think keyless ignition is the best thing since the automatic transmission, there are drawbacks. When you need to find your key or key fob, you may not know which pocket it's in. Also, you get so used to not using a key that you may forget to turn the vehicle off with the button. You'll get a reminder when you try to leave, either a warning chime or a degrading voice that seems to scream, "Hey idiot, turn off the engine!"

Kraft’s speech, both in delivery and content, summed up the feelings of everyone interviewed about the former Patriot.

Surprised by his brother’s visit, the Kiwanuka boys went riding, like they had for the two years since Mathias had bought a pair of Honda CBR 1,000s — black for Ben, silver for himself.

Appointed by the four congressional leaders, the 12-member panel was given extraordinarily broad power to act. Any part of the budget was fair game. And if a majority of supercommittee members agreed on a plan, the House and Senate would have to take it up for a vote without making changes.
“The Commission in recent years has worked hard to conduct public involvement programs in conjunction with its capital projects as a means of identifying community concerns and mitigating the impact of its bridge rehabilitations and other construction-related endeavors,” said Frank G. McCartney, the DRJTBC's executive director. “After hearing the input of local residents and business owners about the project’s original work scheduled, we decided to postpone this project to mitigate potential local economic impacts. Our goal is to be a good partner with local communities along the river, and this scheduling accommodation reflects that commitment.”

But now he no longer had the typical warning signs - the sweats, shaking, and dizziness - that used to tell him he needed sugar. He knew this was not a good thing.

"Then I'd test my blood sugar and it was dangerously low."
"I think it was a challenging work load," coach Pete DeBoer said. "I don't know if I'd put a term on it. Not a lot of work early. A lot of work. And then third period with a one-goal lead, whether you're getting work or not, you're mentally engaged and that's tough.

The British journalists, like the academics before them, dare to tread where an army of goons has gone before. If they do not recognize the ember of anti-Semitism still glowing within them, they ought to park themselves before a mirror and ask why, of all the nations, do they single out Israel for reprimand and obloquy? This business of assigning to Jews a special burden has a dark and ugly pedigree: the chosen people, again - and again in the wrong way.

Instead of tinkering around the edges and endlessly fighting for reforms that offer little hope of transforming the system, we need to redesign it from the ground up. Perhaps we should, in the words of the late reformer Marshall Fritz, "separate school and state" and allow the market to provide schools just as we allow it to provide food and other vital services.
The lapses began on Jan. 4, when a dead dog taken to an airport security checkpoint by its owner ended up being loaded onto a Continental Airlines jet without being screened.

I say this with credible specificity because one of my neighbors who, like me, was at State in the late '70s points out the concerts are just like frat mixers on "Party" Hardy Avenue: The band is off to the side playing to itself while the drunks are hitting on each other, puking in the bushes and doing face dives into the asphalt.

øIt doesn't soften his indoctrination that he was a Sports Illustrated cover boy at age 16. That he accelerated his high school graduation so he could be drafted a year early and, after being the first pick in the 2010 draft, that the most famous moment in his 129-game minor league career was blowing a kiss after hitting a home run.

Unlike the United States, which has centralized institutions in Washington for raising taxes and spending money, the euro nations have 17 independent treasuries with little oversight from Brussels, the headquarters of the EU.
If not his anti-environmental views, perhaps what will sink Mr. Santorum is his opposition to prenatal testing (because it might lead women to favor an abortion) or his opinion that contraception is a "license to do things" or his generally scolding view of human behavior. If the GOP wants someone who can beat Mr. Obama in the fall, it needs a candidate who can attract Democrats and independent voters. If Mr. Santorum keeps pushing his far-right social agenda, it's hard to believe he will be their man.

Sniping: In filings, prosecutors have accused William and Andrea Whitaker, Dimora's lawyers, of frivolous delay tactics. They've also bickered with the Whitakers over what potentially inflammatory words could be used at trial, like "godfather." "We agree not to use the word 'bribe' if they agree not to use the words 'gift' or 'friend'," Rowland told the judge during a recent pre-trial hearing.
I tend to be a bit sheepish with my answer. "Well," I say, scanning the room for exits, "I'm doing the course of study for ordination in my denomination." This is usually met with surprise, and occasionally confusion. I met up with a group of high school friends this summer, and they joked that the shyest one in our old gang is the one now preparing to preach. How unlikely.

Rex Brothers pitched the eighth and Rafael Betancourt survived a rocky ninth — giving up a solo homer to Nick Hundley and putting two more runners on — before striking out Yonder Alonso to earn his third save in as many chances.
The one area of Valmeyer's play with the most room for improvement is defense. No one expects the vanguard of this high-flying crew to square off into a time-wasting stall, but all too often the opposition took advantage of the Pirates' own velocity and racked up big scores.
Grocery store prices appear to be leveling off after increasing for most of the past two years. Consumers paid less last month for vegetables, dairy products, and meat, fish and eggs.

"In our case, we have options. It might depend on the opponent for the goalie. It might depend on who is playing well at the end of the year, on experience . . . it might depend on a lot of things. But it's not cast in stone for the rest of the playoffs.
With the sails up and the trades blowing, we cruised at an average of 10 knots, about 11 1/2 mph. Wind waves slapped the sides of the catamaran. Salt, deposited on the ship from evaporated seawater, caked my palms as I used the handrails to wobble around the craft. I held the railing as I stared north. Kauai was somewhere out there in the monstrous Pacific.

Beverly Hills cosmetic surgeon Dr. Gabriel Chiu -- who did some of his residency training at Robinson Memorial Hospital in Ravenna -- says men now make up more than 20 percent of his patients. He attributes the exceptionally high percentage at his practice, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, to the general body-conscious culture in Los Angeles, and specifically to the high percentage of gay men who live in nearby West Hollywood.

Around the time of its funding round last summer, the speculation was that Evernote would join the $1 billion valuation club, but according to TechCrunch it did not quite make it.
Madison Young: Femina Potens began in 2001 after I moved to San Francisco as an Ohio ex-pat. I was surprised when I settled into the city and found a real lack of spaces for women and trans communities and found a lack of visibility of women and transgender artists at galleries, open mics, rock shows and in the art scene in general. I wanted to create a space where women and transgender artists could cultivate new artwork and bring greater visibility to women and trans artists. We started in 2001 with just an idea, passion, and a feeling of responsibility to the community to make a difference. At that time, we had no funding and I believe that I was even in between jobs and housing. But I knew that this was something that I had to do, so I did it. Now we produce close to 50 LGBT art events each year that work toward the advancement of women and trans communities in the arts, and have just acquired a new storefront gallery space in the Castro.
A talking clock wakes her up in the morning. A pillbox with a voice tells her, five times a day, to take her medicine. A plastic device, about the size of a man's wallet, announces, in its mechanical voice, what color her shirts and pants are, so she can be sure they match.
"It's possible -- how he'll play is another thing," Adelman said of Love. "We've had guys come back but they weren't the same players. If he wants to play and the doctor says it's OK, I'm happy to put him out there. But we're going to be cautious."

LANSING  Gov. Rick Snyder issued an executive order today to establish a criminal investigations unit inside the state Gaming Control Board.
Dudek said more than half of the seven acres Hammond Park Pool owns are wetlands and not developable, but the state assesses all seven acres. He said the pool's roughly $17,000 property tax bill was reduced by $2,000 after they appealed the assessment, but the reduction did not reflect the fact that the wetlands make the undeveloped part of the property worthless. The pool has requested its appeal be heard by a citizens board, but a hearing has yet to be scheduled.
Others, however, questioned the wisdom of taking such drastic action with such a young child.
“He's got a good two-seamer and he's got some sink,” batterymate Martin said. “So when he executes his pitches he's going to get his share of ground balls.”
Like the restaurant itself, Morimoto takes diners on a roller coaster of serious and sometimes whimsical dishes. Despite some that left me wondering what the chef might have been thinking, I always left satisfied. I realized Napa has arrived.
Saturday night at 8 p.m., it’s entertainment, with a comedy show called “Get Hypnotized,” in which he brings volunteers onstage and turns them into performers. “I create environments, give them new personalities, and we have some fun,” he says. On Sunday at 5 p.m., he gives the hypnotists tools a practical application in a smoking-cessation seminar.

Participants pay a $25 donation to the GCC Foundation to secure a 20’ x 30’ garden plot for the season. The ground is plowed and disked in late March and is available for use from April 1 until Thanksgiving. Ryder donates his time and the college furnishes the land, so that all proceeds go to the foundation scholarship fund.
It's bad. Gibson initially is wound up by Grigorieva breast-feeding their baby daughter, Lucia; seems he has always suspected she had breast implants and he hates them, thinks they make her look "like a Vegas whore," and can't stand it when she goes out in tight clothes. If she gets raped -- and there he uses the N-word -- she will have provoked it, he says. "You are provocatively dressed all the time with your fake boobs that you feel you have to show off. I don’t like it. I don’t want that woman. I don’t want you. I don’t trust you. I don’t love you.”
Where to savor the games
There are good athletes everywhere on this campus. Just not enough who choose to play football. Not cool to lose so much, some tell you. Demands at home, others say. Also, there is a contingent here who have simply seen the brothers and uncles before them pass through the football program at Parkrose with too little to show for it.
He was small for his age and desperate for friends, said Young. When she bought Moore toys, he usually gave them away.

On Oahu, local and visiting hikers have gotten injured, lost or stranded after falling or going off various trails in, among other places, the lush Manoa and Kahana valleys and the steep cliffs of Olomana. On the Big Island, death and serious injuries have resulted from leaving marked trails or venturing into closed areas inside Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park and the active volcanic sites in the Puna district. (You shouldn't need to fall into a steam vent or fall through a fragile layer of newly formed rock into lava to know that's a bad thing.)
The same thick Greek yogurt used in the tzatziki comes as dessert with honey and nuts ($7). It's good, but karithopita ($7), a moist walnut cake, is even better. However, galaktobouriko ($7), filo-wrapped custard, was cloyingly sweet and bland.
Why can't Major League Baseball get creative and come up with something that fans could look forward to when games go into extra innings — something that could wrap the game up early enough to accommodate those who must get up the next day to go to work or school?
“Find out the truth about why Mays High School test scores are always high,” a teacher wrote to the state agency that licenses educators. “The answer is the practice tests are real test items.”
The Tigers foursome included junior Crystal Beffa, sophomore Hilary Ogle, freshman Vanessa Strathman and Borman. Affton edged Festus in the event to take the sectional title last season.
It was late in that game, the Rangers desperately clinging to a lead and to their playoff hopes, when Callahan planted himself in front of Boston defenseman Zdeno Chara and his hundred-mile-an-hour slapshot, executed easily the bravest (or craziest) play in all of professional sports by serving as a human shield.
“Since it’s the Bill Tierney Rule,” said Hoffman. “We’re adjourned.”
We're with you on one thing: When we first heard about this, we thought it an Onion creation or one of those tall tales, like the one about the guy who formed an organization to clothe naked animals.
Over the years, Id guess Ive seen the home team win a half-dozen times or so in probably 50-60 games. Never kept me from going back. There was the year the basket of tickets came down from above with incredibly good seats, better than we could have ever hoped for; there was the year we migrated from rightfield upper deck to ending up right behind the home dugout. Then, of course, watching Kirk Gibson stand up for his pitcher after we had heckled him for blowing a save, half afraid that he was going to come into the stands and teach us a thing or two about manners. Doesnt matter  I worshipped every guy that donned that D and took the field. Whether they won or lost, they were my team. And yes, as such, I felt entitled to grumble from time to time, but they were, and are, the Tigers.
The Rev. William Sinkford, who is president of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, insisted Tuesday that their churches across the country will "be open for business" on Sunday.
"We're trying to establish a fly-around, knock 'em out kind of defense," Vassallo said, "and just try to create more turnovers this year. One thing that we didn't do last year was take advantage of our opportunities. We have to be better at that this year."

A person we love is at Heather Hill and I know many of our Sun News readers have had a friend or relative at this location. What some of us might not have realized while in the area of Route 322 and Bass Lake Road are the shopping opportunities that avail themselves to visitors like me from outside their own communities.
If Kasich doesn't get his price, he will scrap the whole idea and consider other options, including moving the turnpike under the control of the Ohio Department of Transportation and likely disbanding the Ohio Turnpike Commission, which currently operates the toll road.
The two state athletic associations are spearheading much of the education process. Craig Anderson, assistant executive director for the IHSA, said head coaches and officials will receive concussion awareness training in meetings. He said awareness, as much as anything, is key.
Wells said she hadn't spoken to her client about the allegations, but previously Ibarra had told her Ingo had suffered from diarrhea and had lost weight.
Curtis (4-3), meanwhile, was frustrated with its disconcerting trend of starting slow. The Warriors have trailed early often, as was the case on Tuesday. They have rallied frequently, sometimes for victories, other times losses.
Konerko said the Sox could play .700 ball in April and it won't mean a thing. And if they .300 ball it won't mean a thing because "we still have to play five more months. Nothing is written in stone about your season if you have a good or bad start.''
It is not a flashy place, but it is, like Parker and his family, solid.

But don’t expect this show to be all smiles and happy endings – although Manzo does aim to make each event meaningful, and believes there are instances where the parties are actually life-changing. The “work (rhymes with witch)” will appear, she says. “There are times when I’m just snapping at everyone because things aren’t going the right way, and I call her Meana. She only shows up the day of events when we’re setting up. Dina apologizes for Meana the next day.”

He was projected to go in the middle rounds but ended up being the 26th receiver selected. The reason for his slip is unknown but could be partially due to sub-par performances against Nebraska and Oklahoma last season.

Feliciano’s attorney, public defender Neill Hamilton, had claimed two violations of Feliciano’s Miranda rights.

Also, Hamilton contended that Feliciano invoked his right to have an attorney.

Melding all those influences, Fern Knight carries listeners on languid, ethereal waves into medieval times: 1969, say, or 1970. Through the mists tinkle exotic traces of Alice Coltrane's 1970 "Journey in Satchidananda" - "I think I listened to that every day in 2006 on my way to work," Wienk says.
Performer Jeremy Southard plays his character with the air of a gentleman of refinement who prides himself on his benign tolerance for the little men around him, and this attitude is showcased well in songs such as "Why Do the Wrong People Travel?"

In a statement issued in tandem with the mayor's, Cancel said it was time for him and his family "to return to my native city, and I thank the staff and commissioners for the privilege of being their director."
A too-hasty U.S. withdrawal would almost certainly result in the fall of the Karzai government, with the likely return of the Taliban. Al-Qaida would have an opportunity to move in and reconstitute its strength, along with militant groups bent on the overthrow of Pakistan. Afghanistan would again become a base not only for attacks on the United States but on its neighbor.
"On a day like today, you're seeing optimism become a reality," Lewis said.
Last September, when a Wegmans opened in Harford County, police and store employees had to direct traffic in the parking lot and the store was jammed all day long. Our sister newspaper, the Aegis, described the scene like this: "If you combined a grocery store's crowd on the night before a snowstorm plus the frantic feeling of Christmas Eve, you might begin to skim the insanity that was the store's opening day."

Still, concerns about deflation remain muted in the U.S. because of the aggressive actions taken by the Fed -- actions that would threaten to ignite inflation if the economy weren't so weak. The central bank has pushed a key interest rate to a record low near zero and has taken other steps to flood the banking system with cash to ease credit.
"I was just getting started at that time of night," Eustachy told me Thursday. "Just stretching."
OSU dangled the chance to play in a bowl game, but only if he agreed to return and serve a five-game suspension. Whose interests did that serve? OSU's and that of the BCS, to name two. To be fair, it served Pryor's interest to an extent, at least until OSU concluded the only way to quench the NCAA's thirst for punishment was to cut ties with the coach whose silence kept Pryor eligible through the 2010 season.
Mitchell, like Ford, was a believer. He thought there might be something to Bartolotta kicking the football, so he called the house. Mitchell's pitch: Give it a shot. If you want out after the first day, no problem, don't come back.

This year, he transferred into a vocational machine shop class. While he enjoyed the class and said it will probably be useful, he would have preferred welding.
"There's something that changes spiritually, I guess, as you mature," she continued, "and the anger turns to something else. Not that I don't get pissed. I really do get pissed, especially at the government and politicians, but I don't carry it as an all-consuming fire. It's different. And I guess I was trying to understand what I meant by its difference, and that's why that song came into focus."
Talking to the Strasbergs -- and I spoke not only to DLS and Anna Strasberg but also to John Strasberg, the son Strasberg had with his second wife, Paula, and a veteran acting instructor who's no longer associated with the institute -- can seem a bit like watching one of those mid-20th century family dramas in which Method actors let their idiosyncrasies and tics fly. Conflict and contradiction peek out of a facade of domestic tranquillity the way it always will when an inheritance -- be it intellectual or financial -- is at stake.

"We finally started attacking the basket," Cor Jesu coach John Neff said. "We spread them out and stopped putting the ball up from the perimeter."
"We went to college in Austin, Texas," Jay Duplass said. "We first attended Sundance in 1993 and found that 90 percent of the directors lived in Brooklyn, so we thought: Let's go to Brooklyn.

Though a surefire pocket passer, Van Doren has improved his mobility from a season ago. He is extremely versatile in that he can go under center or line up in shotgun and excel in both.

Still, this foul-up might expose a problem that haunts many executives late in their tenure -- the inability to close strong and stay focused. Perhaps Daniels shouldn't have spent the past year writing a book about the federal government, flirting with a presidential run, and traveling from coast to coast and beyond to build his name recognition. Every organization needs a leader who is fully focused on the job at hand -- not the next one.

"It was fun," Flanagan said. "We threw ourselves out on the big stage for our first marathon. I wanted to do that. I wanted to find out immediately if I was made for this, cut out for it.

We see, move and react in tiny increments of this unconscious "now": Motorists make constant calculations of time to avoid collisions. Athletes use split-second estimates of time to connect with an incoming ball. Planting a kiss in the right place requires a precise coordination of movement and time estimation. The person with an off-kilter sense of the "now" will have problems with timing.

Beltran is having a nice rebound season, batting .281-12-55 with a .863 on-base plus slugging percentage. McCutchen (.294-12-46) has been better, logging a .890 OPS in addition to 15 steals, 12 more than Beltran. No doubt NL manager Bruce Bochy can count on a professional at-bat from the switch-hitting Beltran late in the game.
In May 2004, the state's attorney's office determined there wasn't enough evidence to charge Vanecko. A Chicago Sun-Times investigation prompted the Chicago Police Department to re-examine the case last year, when they identified Vanecko for the first time as having thrown the deadly punch but didn't charge him, concluding that he acted in self-defense even though Vanecko threw the only punch and then ran away.
Pain medicines are a prime concern. I'm sure your five medicines were for pain. It's often a matter of trial and error until the medicine specifically for you is found. Amitriptyline, an antidepressant, often is chosen not for its properties to relieve depression but for its pain-relieving.
"We're a deep team," Huestis said. "There are a lot of us who can step in and contribute to the game. It's a great thing. Coach always says it's about what you do with your minutes. Forty minutes is not that long and you have to produce."

This was the first game without Iman Shumpert, the rookie shooting guard who tore his ACL in Game 1. Without Shumpert, who could play three positions, the Knicks had a new-look rotation. Mike Bibby, the little-used point guard, saw 20 minutes of action with Davis playing ineffectively. Novak played 20 minutes and Smith saw 31.
Recommendation No. 1 is to define "nonviolent" vs. "active resistance" and "violent" protests  and clarify use of force for each. In the UC Davis incident, administrators made extreme assumptions of an Oakland-style event, where thugs threw bottles at police and defaced property. But, inexplicably, they had no plans or procedures for that kind of event  much less for removing a 35-tent encampment.

In the 1990s, the FCC decided that grisly anti-abortion ads are not "indecent," but that TV stations could "channel" them to a "safe harbor." In other words, a TV station could limit these ads to the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

U.S. on January 29th was not, as it turns out, read to every Catholic congregation. Catholic army chaplains were instructed not to read the letter, because it hadn't been approved by the army's office of the Chief of Chaplaincy. A version edited by the Secretary of the Army, John McHugh, has now been approved for the chaplains to read. Seriously? We have a member of the administration editing pastoral letters?
And, despite the national furor over immigration, banks blatantly have catered to immigrant customers.
The U.S. considers China a vital player in attempts to contain North Korean aggression against South Korea and its development of a nuclear weapon. The U.S. also needs Chinese support to increase pressure on Iran, as China is a U.N. Security Council member.
After his wife goes missing on a trip to Ethiopia, Zan's parenting decisions are often bad enough to be unconvincing as narrative.

“We’re giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy a VIP-style experience with our new Close Encounters tour,” Siebeneicher said. “This is a guided bus tour that leaves from the theme park and tours the 350-acre safari with a highlight that includes stopping at Camp Rose section of the safari to hand-feed the towering giraffes.”
"They put so much steel in it that there is no way in hell for all that concrete to get though" without trapping voids or weak pockets of contaminated concrete, particularly at the edge of the pile, Brown said, calling one section "ridiculous" in its congestion.

"We are seeing ticks already, which are a couple weeks early. Mosquitoes have already been biting people for the last couple weeks. Cutworm moths, we usually don't see those until the beginning of April," said Wayne Bailey, a field crop entomologist with the University of Missouri. "We've had more survivorship than what we want. I'm not so concerned about what overwintered here, but what overwintered south of us that could come to us earlier."
To turn the trick this time, the Blues will need to create more scoring opportunities, after scoring just three goals on 58 shots in Games 1-2. The power-play unit must crack LA's stingy penalty-killers. And with defenseman Alex Pietrangelo not assured of returning Thursday, the back end has to regroup after a crippling performance Monday.
But Lin needs to think long and hard about coming back for this series before he takes the plunge. It has all the makings of a baptism by inferno and he doesn't need that on his resume, not when he will be a restricted free agent this summer.

While gay-rights activists hailed President Barack Obama's support for same-sex marriage as a symbolic victory, for many around the world the idea of legal unions between homosexuals is a distant dream.

Added cornerback Sheldon Brown: "The only way to learn in this game as a young player is to be out there doing certain things. Unfortunately it happened, but we have to play faster and start faster. You can never point the blame or the finger at one person."
Jerry Sandusky was doing under his watch. Can you imagine Paterno leading his team into the stadium and half the fans booing him? Or, even worse, cheering him — like a group of misguided students did this evening on his front lawn?

øShelton, in working to restore the Fiesta Bowl's image, has personally met with numerous university presidents, his former peers. He hopes those ties, in addition to the relationships he forged in south Florida, will allow the Fiesta Bowl retain its status as an elite post-season college football bowl as the new playoff plan is developed during the next few months.
McNee and Mindel proved their point. When done well - and I can't remember when I've had better - this dish has no rival. However, what convinced me that the chef has a similar unrelenting passion as do people like Chris Cosentino at Incanto or Paul Bertolli of Fra' Mani, was his version of tripe soup ($9).

More common are those cases when external political events sharply shift the political narrative, such as the ouster of the Spanish government in the aftermath of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. The events of September 11th also had a major impact on the subsequent Australian election, as did a concurrent immigration controversy. Realistically, this type of shock is McCain's last hope, yet the rush to early voting has also blunted the possible impact of any last minute shock.
There was an exhaustive search by the police and a crush of media attention. The boy's photo was one of the first of a missing child on a milk carton. Thousands of fliers were plastered around the city, buildings canvassed, hundreds of people interviewed. SoHo was not a neighborhood of swank boutiques and galleries as now, but of working-class New Yorkers rattled by the news.

At one point, she let out a faint, frustrated "ohhhhh!" and raked her hair with her hands when Pinault's lawyer, David Aaronson, said she was looking for $46,000 a month. While that's what she said she's spending on the child, Evangelista's lawyer said Thursday she isn't asking for any particular amount.
The coalition gears up each time the farm bill comes up for renewal every five years. Their pitch to lawmakers is as direct as the sugar lobby's: Protecting one industry at the expense of other businesses and consumers, they say, is unfair. Several members of the House and Senate have been persuaded and are pushing legislation to kill or gut the sugar program. "It just does not make sense and puts U.S. manufacturers at a tremendous disadvantage," said Sen. Jeanne Sheehan, D-N.H.
Wyoming is the third-ranked state for onshore gas production and ninth for onshore oil production. Nearly every new oil and gas well in Wyoming that isn't a coal-bed methane well is fracked.

Stink bombs or firebombs? Free Tibet or squatters rights? The idealistic do-gooders in "The Altruists" have the strength of countless convictions. They just can't keep straight exactly what they have signed up to protest -- and they're not so good at keeping their personal lives in order, either.

The surgery went off no problem a year ago June. With a smaller stomach, he isn't hungry anymore. And if he does overeat in a fit of what bariatric patients call "head hunger," meaning you aren't really hungry but you're brain is demanding French fries like a bleating sheep, it makes him want to puke.

Something similar could happen in financial markets. Investors -- not knowing whether inflation would return to 2 percent and fearing it might go higher than 4 percent -- might demand much higher interest rates to prevent erosion of their money. This, too, would undermine Krugman's strategy.
The opera, he explained, keeps flashing back to the main scene of the bus stop. "Those scenes have a specific sound, one that is sort of frozen in time.

No surprise here that I think Obama's right about why we need to start dealing with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States today, not to mention the thousands more who want to come here tomorrow. But I doubt any amount of data about how immigrants contribute, say, to the economy will win over skeptics. Facts about why we should create a new immigration system have been out there since before Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, tried to overhaul the system.

THEFT (RECOVERED), EAST WASHINGTON STREET: A $700 Apple iPhone with a GPS tracking locator found its way back into the owner’s locker at Chagrin Falls High School April 19. The initial theft report came in about 7:30 a.m. and the juvenile’s family got on a computer to trace its whereabouts, which were plotted at South Main Street. Police followed the coordinates, however were unable to locate the iPhone there. But police believe whoever had it must have located them looking for it. From that point, the owner’s family reported the computer tracking showed the phone was moving toward the school and a short time later turned up in the rightful owner’s locker.

Transamerica spent about a year readying for its move to 100 Light St., deconstructing the floors so they could be rebuilt the way the company wanted: Lots of open cubicles rather than closed-door offices.

The movie, based on Suzanne Collins' successful young adult novels, was given a PG-13 rating due to "intense violent thematic material and disturbing material -- all involving teens." The question of this PG-13 rating, instead of an R rating, has been debated since the rating was assigned.

He’s modeled the unpretentious Greek Village Grille after the small gyro shops (“gyradika”) found all over Greece, where he recently wed. Indeed, the first thing you’ll likely notice upon entering this tiny eatery is the five large, sizzling, vertical spits of gyro meat (traditional lamb and beef combos, plus chicken and pork). Karakostas says that it’s the pork that’s the traditional Greek gyro filling, contrary to popular belief. Greek Village Grille is one of only a handful of places in the United States to offer it. The huge gyros, available traditional style or “dirty,” with mustard and fries, are a bargain at $5.50. The house tzatziki is wonderfully thick and garlicky. Lakewood’s many vegetarians will find plenty of meatless options, as well, including slow-simmered gigantes beans in house-made tomato sauce with Greek seasonings ($4.25 with feta); roasted red pepper hummus with pita wedges ($5); and village salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, Kalamata olives, feta, and house dressing.

“My situation was so special, because my mom was such a great role model for me,” Key notes. “She worked in the Louisville school system and I remember growing up seeing her at meetings and being a very passionate, opinionated person, and she would often be the only woman in a room full of men. So coming from that background, it never even occurred to me that being a woman was an issue… I don’t like the dialectic still, and I think it’s crazy that in 2012, having a woman guitarist in your band can still be a selling point. But I do think women have something to offer playing the guitar that is distinctive and that people want to hear.”

Meanwhile, the tacky Polynesian kitsch mercifully was rejected.

USA Today: As an artist, Carole King helped pave the way for generations of creatively autonomous women. As a woman, she long harbored a desperate need for male affection and affirmation, enduring troubled and even abusive relationships. ... But A Natural Woman is hardly a sob story. There's more humor and joy than pathos; and predictably, many of the happy moments involve music. There are leisurely, detailed accounts of recording sessions, and of collaborations, friendships and memorable encounters with fellow icons such as John Lennon and James Taylor.

I sampled only two of 19 mains. Both -- Grilled Salmon With Soba Dumplings and Maple-Ginger Braised Chicken Thighs With Butternut Squash -- featured heady broths into which the dish's sides were quickly submerged.

I'm going to miss this a lot'. … He said, 'You have your family. This is all I have.' And he got teary-eyed. … We had our run-ins.

The trees were there first: century-old live oaks, thick with Spanish moss, spiring through the land that eventually became Skipper's. Each time the owners thought of expanding, they had but one edict: Do not harm the trees. Since 1986, the man charged with maintaining the canopy has been Land O'Lakes arborist Jason Bean, who scales the oaks to trim branches and make repairs. Skipper's regulars may recognize him for another role. Each Halloween, for the bar's annual Freaker's Ball, Bean climbs the trees in costume and waits for the perfect moment to swing down and terrify the crowd.

That raises the question of whether the United States and its allies should undertake military action in Syria, as they did in Libya. That would be a mistake. It isn't just that Russia and China probably would block a Security Council resolution of the kind that established theno-fly zone in Libya. (Russia, which abstained on that resolution, later criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for using an authorization to protect civilians as a justification for regime change.)U.S. military action in Syria, a nation that is larger than Libya and that has close ties to Iran, could enmesh this country in a civil war that might continue along sectarian lines even if Assad were deposed. That is what occurred in Iraq during the U.S. occupation, prolonging American involvement.
