In 2011 the U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum (TIME magazine, March 26, 2012). Unlike the beliefs of our brainy presidential candidates, pumping more oil is not going to lower the price of gasoline. Oil is a commodity that is vulnerable to price spikes caused not only by supply and demand but by just about any geo-political concerns that pop up. Demand from growing economies like China, India and other emerging markets is behind the current high price of oil as well as Iran's belligerence toward the West.
It's tempting to see his Yorkshire paintings — with their attention to the changing seasons, the cycle of life and death — as a natural progression for a septuagenarian artist, a suggestion he doesn't deny. Hockney likes to call painting "an old man's art," and concedes that he probably wouldn't, or perhaps couldn't, have made these works as a younger artist.

øSeats are comfy, front and back, and the car feels much roomier than its specs suggest. Front especially, because there's no fat console or towering center stack of controls. And the rear has unexpected knee and toe space. That wide-open feel means adults can be happy inside.
The play opens with Alsop in his heyday and then charts his decline as his pro-war stance grows increasingly out-of-touch, and younger reporters like David Halberstam dismiss him as a "preening D.C. socialite with a press pass." How he handled his sexuality and an attempt to blackmail him is also addressed.

Time and again, the Legislature panders to corporate interests despite the expressed will of the voters. Protecting our ballot initiatives is the best way to combat this.

Commissioners meet numerous times throughout the city in full public view — except for the many times that they meet in cliques behind closed doors, receiving private instructions from emissaries sent from council offices.

Speaker cards are often shuffled to ensure that particular constituent comments are heard early and that others come only after a wait of up to five hours.

Health benefits may come as much from what vegetarians do eat as from what they don't. Studies show that vegetarians not only consume less artery-clogging saturated fat and cholesterol but also get more of certain antioxidants and vitamins, such as potassium, magnesium and vitamin C. They eat up to twice as much heart-healthy fiber, from fruit, vegetables and whole grains. They have lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure readings. And they tend to be leaner than meat-eaters.

Denying jobs solely on the basis of criminal convictions is illegal, because it would disproportionately affect blacks and Latinos, who have higher rates of arrest and criminal conviction.

When dinner, drinks and dessert can top $100 per person, that's not a small consideration.

Finally, the proposed code requires a chief legal officer to carry out the board's duties, to conduct investigations and to provide due process for all received complaints. We believe this is a huge, full-time, professional job, which requires scrupulous independence and dedication to the code's many requirements.

However, the chief enforcement officer of a code of ethics must stand apart from the executive department and must keep both eyes squarely on the goal.

Use industrial-strength nail cutters, since wimpy ones will split nails.

Workers are hired with the knowledge that there will be few, if any, opportunities for advancement, even though they will be expected to continue to upgrade their skills, mostly on their own time and at their own expense. They know that they may be let go for no reason for the first few years of their assignment, must go without a paycheck for several months a year, and cannot take a vacation except during that time of unemployment. There are constant interruptions while they are working, and every year or two, the product description changes, but they are expected to make the same high-quality product, regardless of whether the raw materials are broken, the wrong size or even missing. The equipment they must use is often broken, outdated or missing. The workers are often required to work overtime, but are not paid extra.

Send his favorite pj's and security object with him, then follow through with your promise. (Don't be too surprised if your child is fast asleep when you arrive for pick up).

The brick-and-timber industrial building was previously used as a stockyard, asphalt roof company and truck terminal before it was transformed into a food court. But the initial remodeling project covered up the building's industrial look, which is now being restored.
Joni James: There is no guarantee that teachers will back Crist over Meek, who was the architect of the 2002 class-size amendment. Plus, the Florida Education Association's support of Bill McBride's 2002 challenge to Jeb Bush ultimately meant very little.
Fisher's challenge says the Top Ten Percent law was working to increase diversity and that minority enrollment was higher than it had been under the earlier race-conscious system.
That brought up Ramos, who hit a 1-2 slider to bring home Lombardozzi and set off a celebration, with his teammates streaming out of the dugout to greet him at first base. Someone smeared Ramos with shaving cream.
"It hurt so bad, but I did it. I got through it. You grin and bear, and that's what I did."
I've been doing a lot of new-construction inspections or one-year warranty inspections on new construction houses, and I've started to notice a new attic bypass that seems to be completely ignored by some builders and insulation contractors. At a recent new construction inspection in Woodbury, I actually had a good suspicion that I would find this defect as soon as I pulled up to the house and looked at the frost covered roof. That dark spot on the roof shows a warm spot where the frost never accumulated. Click on the photo for a larger version.
Moore injured Vancouver team captain Markus Naslund during a Feb. 16 game. In the teams' March 8 game, a fight-filled tilt with the Avalanche enjoying a large lead, Bertuzzi was sent on the ice late in the third period but failed to instigate Moore into a fight. Bertuzzi skated up from behind Moore, grabbed his jersey and punched him in the back of the head. As Moore fell, Bertuzzi drove Moore's face into the ice and landed on top of Moore, along with one Avs player and one Canuck. The hit and the pileup gave Moore three fractured neck vertebrae and a concussion. The NHL suspended Bertuzzi for the remainder of the regular season and the playoffs, and the ban was extended internationally during the NHL lockout of 2004-05. He was reinstated for the 2005-06 season.
For two years, the St. Louis County Port Authority, the Lemay Community Center Advisory Committee and residents came together for public meetings. A lot of ideas were exchanged.
Perira said Torres had recently rented out a room in her apartment in March and was happy to have found a boarder to help her defray expenses. But Perira said he’d never met the person who had moved in to the first-floor apartment of the three-story rowhouse with gray-and-white siding. Perira said he learned Calero was the second victim only after police showed him a photo.
In some ways, Grebel sees himself as a movie director at NJIT: his students are the actors and the technical scrawlings on the whiteboard are scripts.

The memorial on the side of Steve Reynolds Boulevard took shape on soil littered with pieces of Wideman’s Trailblazer. People left flowers, and someone tied a Mylar smiley balloon to a rail closest to the spot where Wideman’s SUV finally stopped. The tributes stand in colorful contrast to the blacktop where a life ended.

They didn't have much problem against Hochevar.
Back on the mainland, we continue east past the quirky Accordion Museum, then stop for samples at a traditional apple cider maker in Cap-St.-Ignace. Chiming church bells usher us into L'Islet-sur-Mer, another official beauty spot with a popular maritime museum, where we order Middle Eastern- and Asian-influenced tapas on a deck overlooking the river at La Salicorne Café. By now, we've learned that even fast food places using local ingredients are identified with a red Arrêt Gourmand sign. We are never disappointed.
Perhaps the best-known examples are subscription-based online retailers such as Los Angeles' ShoeDazzle and Santa Monica's BeachMint's StyleMint, JewelMint, ShoeMint and BeautyMint, which offer shoppers access to personalized "showrooms" of merchandise for flat monthly fees charged whether shoppers decide to buy or not. Celebrity tie-ins are often involved: ShoeDazzle charges $39.95 for monthly access to shoes and handbags endorsed by Kim Kardashian, while StyleMint customers pay $29.99 for a choice of T-shirts vetted by the Olsen twins. New York's Birchbox offers monthly deliveries of sample-size beauty products packaged in a signature pink box.
Morale is still high among teams on the ground, he said. Authorities consider the operation a search and rescue mission -- not a recovery effort.
My company believes that by investing in quality education, we can help prepare young Americans for the competitive world of a global economy. The GE Foundation’s Developing Futures in Education program invested $22 million in Atlanta Public Schools because we saw progress and wanted to accelerate it. The progress has been considerable:
Roam delivers good value, but I must say the burger prices can send the eyebrows up. The elk burger runs $18 — OK, game meat and all that — but a basic beef burger costs $16. Even a veggie burger is $15. Those are Manhattan prices, and seem out of line with the rest of the menu.
A court hearing was held in March to discuss the final effort to preserve his license, and Midei said afterward that he felt "optimistic."

NEARK -- Nineteen men, including the owner of an Edison pharmacy, are in federal custody and authorities said today they are searching for three more accused drug dealers involved in illegal sales of the prescription drug, Oxycodone, that brought an illicit New Jersey drug network about $1 million a month.
To me, there are two x-factors for the Ducks: The first is Carlos Emory. If the Ducks have any hope of making the NCAA tournament and then making any sort of run in it, Emory will need to continue to give them important minutes off the bench. When he is playing well, he is a matchup nightmare, which is a huge advantage for Oregon. Devoe Joseph has also been terrific as of late, and seems intent on putting this team on his back and carrying them to wins. He needs to keep that up -- and still take smart shots -- for Oregon to win three games here.
"I wasn't making many shots, but I wasn't taking that many either," said Ginobili, who was 0 for 8 from 3-point range in the first three games but had three 3s Monday and finished with a team-high 17 points. "I really wasn't that worried. I was happy that the team was playing as well as we were. We were 3-0 and winning those games with authority."

Hollie Cavanagh, "Bleeding Love:" Now it's time for the British portion of the evening, and Hollie opts for "Bleeding Love" from U.K. "X Factor" winner Leona Lewis. She reworks the arrangement and slows it down. The song has a darker, bluesier vibe than the hit, and Hollie makes a smart choice to sing it from atop the piano, where she sits very still, which only emphasizes the emotion and maturity in her vocal. She is two for two tonight.
Robinson, who measured in at 6-4, 264 pounds, is a player who didn't have much production in college (12 receptions last season) but he had a tremendous spring, running in the 4.5s for his 40-yard dash. He showed plenty of athleticism to obviously catch the eye of Giants' scouts. The team brought him in for a pre-draft visit.
Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat, has twice sought similar statewide requirements, but they did not become law. Her previous attempts included fines of $50 or $100 for parents who do not attend, but the legislation just introduced, which would apply only to Cleveland, does not spell out any punishment.
Rory Little, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said the Supreme Court is unlikely to review the case because Thursday's ruling is the third appellate court decision upholding the pledge.

Berry won in a wind-legal time of 21.10, and Kent was second in 21.26. They're both entered in Saturday's 400. That could be fun. The meet resumes at 10 a.m.
Many readers find these stories fascinating, but some have wondered noisily why the newspaper would bother with a 40-year-old case that seemed settled long ago. I'll plead guilty, as a Kent alumnus who was there at the time, to being fascinated with the subject. But Mangels doesn't have my connection: He was an 11-year-old Florida sixth-grader in 1970, and didn't have any particular interest in the shootings until the tape fairly dropped into his lap last April while he was working on a 40th anniversary story.

Peter Sterling, general counsel for the public defender system, said its St. Louis County office worked at 160 percent of its capacity in June. He promised to provide details before moving forward with a shutdown, and said he believes prosecutors will come to see his side.
But the studio's hands were tied when it came to promoting the film's stars, who did only a handful of television appearances as they, and their superiors, want to protect the SEALs' identity as much as possible, in keeping with their code of anonymity.
Our friends had moved to this northern German city because the mother had accepted a teaching job. She and her son would be at the same bilingual school, and neither of them had seen it, so we decided to check it out. Part of the walk was along the Berlin Wall, another landmark whose significance was lost on the kids who saw it only as an endless canvas for street art.
The uncertainty about how much Mets co-owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz ultimately must give up has damaged the team’s financial picture, forcing it to slash payroll and try to raise tens of millions of dollars by selling small chunks of the team, though Wilpon, the Mets’ chief executive, said several weeks ago the current owners plan to keep the franchise “for a very long time.”
Officials have said they hoped that many of the parks could be taken over by municipalities or the state. In addition to the park closures, Dooley and his administrators have recommended job cuts, an increase in fees for construction permits and scaling back snow removal.

"If it makes it easier, I think that's going to mean fewer people on the road commuting," said Elizabeth Hazel, a 32-year-old Hampden woman who said she uses the trails recreationally. "It also just makes the city a nicer place to live — it just increases the livability of the city."
"Unlike a street dealer, defendant well understood the effects of the poison he peddled," wrote Assistant U.S. Attys. Ariel A. Neuman and Benjamin R. Barron.

I had no idea what he was talking about. He said he’d received an anonymous letter saying I was preparing to “take him down.” I assured him there was no such story, and invited him for lunch.
Underwater surveys show two large chunks of the ship's iron-armored siding have survived, the largest being 68 feet long and 24 feet tall. Raising them intact will be a priority. Researchers also spotted three cannons on the riverbed, an intact propeller and other pieces of the warship's steam engines. And there's smaller debris scattered across the site that could yield unexpected treasures, requiring careful sifting beneath 40 feet of water.
Dinners, too, are not what they seem. The oddly named chicken tartufo ($26) is a version of saltimbocca, the tender chicken in a bold circle of sweet marsala sauce (a bit of truffle, too), topped with melted mozzarella and prosciutto, sprinkled with mushrooms and decorated with a few spikes of impossibly flavorful asparagus.
USC won 26 NCAA men's outdoor track and field championships between 1926-76.
"I see where it could've been my fault to not follow up," Rolley told an investigator. "Am I kicking myself now that I didn't do it? Of course. I wouldn't be in this situation."
In fact, Missouri's experience proves why it is a bad idea to involve judges. The judges decided to act in secret, arguing that they were performing a judicial task, not a political one. That's a specious argument, but even if it were true, the final result lacks a key element of most judicial rulings: an explanation.
For the new school in Indianapolis, Ogston hopes to recruit students from a 3- to 5-mile radius of the building. If the number of applicants exceeds the school's 300-student capacity, officials will use a lottery system to determine who may enroll.

I think I hear a new cable channel series in the making.
Felton entered the game with 3:48 left in the first and came out firing, making his first three shots, all from three-point range, and scoring nine quick points.
Segel, who's got lovable schlub down to a science, and Adams, not quite as enchanting as she was as the fairy tale princess in 2007's "Enchanted," but close enough, are perfectly cast. They are completely at ease in a world filled with Muppets and Muppet problems, and totally game for the huge musical numbers.
Friends of Theresa Rockwood said she told them her brother had a caseworker and a doctor at Cascadia. Cascadia officials declined to discuss the case, citing federal privacy laws.
Jared Sullinger has power and sure hands. He stole a hard inbounds pass from Gary Bell Jr. under his own basket only inches from Bell's hands and turned it into a conventional 3-point play by Craft. Buford floats into a shot that is so silky you can sense the shimmer of his touch. Thomas in the lane is caged power and urgency. Twice he lost the ball in the early going, while fighting inside shots up against double teams.
Lindo McCleur, who served for more than a decade in the Air Force's Judge Advocate General's office, said she suspects that some problems arise because military officials simply want to protect the privacy of individuals.

It takes far more political skill to speak up for the still-unknowable future, for the messy process that clears away declining companies, allowing capital to migrate to enterprises that deliver the wealth creation and productivity we need to prosper.
Meanwhile in the East, a ridge of high pressure would continue pushing a front southward down the East Coast. This front would move from the Great Lakes and into the Ohio River Valley and Mid-Atlantic states where it would produce widespread scattered showers. This front had not yet produced severe storms, but was likely to do so as it pushed southward and obtain more moisture from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Heat advisories would remain in effect over the Southern Plains and Southeastern U.S. as highs remained in the 90s and high humidity pushed heat indicies over 100 degrees. Farther south, a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico had a low, 30 percent chance of tropical storm formation. The system would continue kicking up scattered showers and thunderstorms over Florida and the Florida Keys, as well as the rest of the Gulf states as it moved northwestward throughout the day.

How Do We Go?: Penitently, as sinning L.A. swinger Mimi Rogers realizes she needs to get back to God before it’s too late. Interestingly, this is a rare mainstream movie attempt to treat the situation as more than just a horror-movie gimmick — the end is now, and it’s for real.
For the most part, the Disney cruise regulars I spoke to marveled at the Dream, calling it bigger, brighter and better than its older cousins, with many more bells and whistles.
Bailie was pleased with his team's effort against Knoll, who pitched eight no-hit innings in the Saxons' 2-1 10-inning win at McMinnville on March 13.
"We had a loan invested in the Coliseum Building and lost that when it was foreclosed on," she said. "The big concern is not wanting a key building like that to become a blight in the neighborhood. We've been through the foreclosure and bank owning it and that hasn't seemed to happen."
In your case, both the dogs and the kids need to learn respect for each other and each other's belongings. Use positive reinforcement during the parenting and training sessions to ensure the acceptable behavior you desire. It may take a little time, but by constantly scrutinizing and correcting who does what when, and perhaps offering something else in its place, the kids and dogs will learn what you expect of them.

He got his wish. He'll be paired with leader Peter Hanson, a Swede who is a stroke ahead of Mickelson at 9-under-par 207 and braced for what he knows will be a Phil lovefest. And he's OK with that.
It was the subsequent increase in the debt ceiling that gave rise to the 12-member supercommittee charged with coming up with a plan to cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 years by Thanksgiving week. Its failure is supposed to trigger automatic cuts in 2013. But, as with Simpson-Bowles and the Obama-Boehner efforts, the supercommittee generated nothing for constituents to use in holding their members accountable.
Detroiters are still standing obediently in lines. They have learned that to survive and to receive any benefits at all, one stands in line and waits. Those who get out of line, just as in school, are usually punished in one way or another. But maybe now is the time to get out of line, or to line up across the path instead of nicely keeping to the right.

Nothing short of a full endorsement of both issues will satisfy many conservatives as they consider the Republican presidential field.

It didn't help that his staff apparently didn't inform reporters who are covering his campaign that he would be appearing at the Terrace Park GOP phone bank.
The telephone survey of 814 randomly selected adults was conducted from Feb. 9-11. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"Countdown," Olbermann's show, was canceled Friday and was to be replaced by another featuring former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer. In a statement, Gore, the former vice president and Nobel laureate, and his business partner Joel Hyatt took an extraordinary swipe at their outspoken host, to whom they had reportedly given a $10-million paycheck as well as an ownership stake in hopes he would raise the tiny network's profile.

The Salt River has had water releases for three years in a row, an unusual occurrance in itself, he said. But before the bladder burst, the last time there was a huge amount of water in the riverbottom was in 1993 and 1995. The problem seemed to be eliminated in 1996, when Roosevelt Dam was raised 77 feet and Arizona also began a 13-year drought.

But White Bird also runs a small, nervy second season of more intimate and often more experimental shows. Its "Uncaged" series is partly about the pleasures of the unexpected, and one of the fun things about following this season's lineup has been jumping around the city from spot to spot, seeing dance in places it doesn't usually happen.
The monument idea was quickly shelved, but in 2006 a reunion of resisters was staged (with Doukhobor help) in nearby Castlegar. Locals say a 3-foot-high bronze model of artist Naomi Lewis' proposed draft-resister memorial now resides at the Vallican Whole Community Centre in the nearby Slocan Valley, a favored haunt of countercultural folk.

Hooper said she believes the website offers comfort to readers, too, who might be in similar situations.
Unlike the Chechen insurgency, the one in Dagestan has not exploded into full-fledged war. Most of the attacks get little or no attention in Russian news media, making it an almost-forgotten conflict.
"In the beginning, I was a bit unsettled when I met Zach," said Veach's engineer, Scott Graves. "I was used to working with older, experienced drivers. But here he was and he looked much younger than his age. But now, I think of him as a race-car driver. I don't think of him as a child. He doesn't act like a child."
Democrats immediately celebrated the jury's verdict.
The executive made his declaration in a time of heightened sensitivity over this issue, Woronchak said.
That problem is how the rules of political engagement have changed for the worse. The change was sparked partly by the new media world, where every sentence and procedural vote can trigger a national reaction instantly.
The day we took the train we spent the morning exploring the town, then hiked a 2-mile trail that meanders in and out of the woods that encircle the lush green Whistler resort golf course. The highlight was spotting a black bear, totally absorbed in thrashing around in the berry bushes that lined the 14th tee. We made it back to the hotel by midafternoon, in time to be picked up by the courtesy shuttle bus and delivered to the Whistler train depot for our reverse route on the "Sea to Sky Climb."

In 1995 under AFDC, a qualifying below-poverty single-parent Missouri family with two children could receive a monthly benefit of $292. In July 2011 under TANF, a comparable Missouri family could receive the same: $292. Adjusted for 15 years of inflation, that's a decrease of 29.8 percent, according to a study released
Too many, as it turned out.
His backers continued to seethe at the tens of millions of dollars in negative advertising from Restore Our Future, a Romney-aligned super PAC that helped torpedo Gingrich’s chances in Iowa and Florida when he could have seized control of the race. The view has not earned him a lot of sympathy.

In the 145-minute film, Bale plays John Miller, a carpetbagging American mortician looking to make a quick buck in China as the Japanese invade the city of Nanjing in 1937. When he holes up in a Catholic boarding school where teenage students and prostitutes have taken refuge from the fighting, Miller suddenly finds himself responsible for their welfare. As the horrors of the war close in — a Japanese commander, for instance, demands that the girls "sing" for officers at a military parade, code for rape — Miller is given a crash course in atrocities as well as his own capacity for sacrifice.
Abject failure is OK with him.

Bit of waterfront history
Just a few miles up the road from Woodloch Pines is The Lodge at Woodloch. Children are pretty much out of the picture here. This is the home of the spa and spa treatments are for those 16 and older. Parents without their kids, newlyweds, and even some singles are seen hiking the trails, taking exercise classes and dining at Tree, the spa's restaurant that serves healthy and tasty meals. Kids' items like chicken fingers and mac 'n' cheese are not on the menu.

Jim: When turning right onto First Capitol Drive (Route 94) from westbound I-70's offramp in St. Charles, unless you're paying close attention, you'll turn directly into a QuikTrip. There are minimal signs (if any) and many people don't realize this until the last second, which causes them to stop in the middle of the road and wait for an out. Could there be more signage, or could the lane be extended past the QT to avoid this. It's almost like MoDOT and QT planned this - kind of like an "exit through the gift shop" scenario at Disneyland.
"In fact, the numbers have been increasing," she said, adding that "out of 65 countries where reliable trend data is available, only three (Croatia, Euador and Estonia) show a significant reduction" from 1990 to 2010.

His unexciting exploits kept making me wish that I was re-watching “Raiders of the Lost Ark’’ or “Avatar’’ — two other classics ineptly aped by “John Carter.’’ Instead, I was enduring a movie even more soul-sucking than “The Phantom Menace.’’
While it is odd to say, given the talent they have, if I had to choose I would go with the San Jose Sharks as the most favorable matchup. The Blues dominated the season series with the Sharks. If they are healthy, the Blues have enough speed to cause problems for San Jose. Sharks goaltender Antti Niemi has won a Stanley Cup, but I would rather take my chances with him than with Quick.
Church officials said the last day for those interested in donating items is April 1 and the last day for those affected by the fire to pick up any items is April 2.

In November, someone whose heart may be two sizes too small vandalized the Honolulu park where the annual Makiki Mele Kalikimaka celebration is held, forcing the cancellation this year of the popular community event. Fortunately, the traditional Honolulu City Lights festivities will be fully powered, starting Dec. 3 with the Public Workers Electric Light Parade and opening night ceremonies at Honolulu Hale (a.k.a. City Hall), which includes a free concert by top island acts at 7:30 p.m. Elaborately decorated Christmas trees, a Christmas wreath contest, the city's own 50-foot "holiday tree" and numerous illuminated displays will remain on view through Christmas, with free milk and cookies Dec. 16, a free showing of "The Wizard of Oz" Dec. 17, and free hot chocolate Thursday and Friday nights through Dec. 23.
Under the current system, the Legislature funds a variety of budgets for different levels and parts of education such as public schools, education service districts and community colleges, said Duncan Wyse, president of the Oregon Business Council and leader of the governor's budget redesign team. These budgets have no focus on outcomes and create perverse incentives, he said.
Yasbin thinks the university will soon approve awarding honorably discharged veterans three credit hours in leadership.
Those angel eyes nodding their little heads in your garden breeze?
Drought causes serious problems, but even without drought the challenge still remains of meeting the increasing demand for fresh water all over the world. A 2010 report by the Water Resources Group, including the World Bank, estimated that the gap between water demand globally and a reliable supply could reach between 40 percent and 50 percent by 2030 because of the growing population, the impact of industrialization, and further spread of irrigated agriculture.
Combine chicken, cut vegetables, separated garlic cloves and bacon pieces in the container (the vegetables should help keep chicken pieces from touching). Add enough red wine - about 3 quarts - to cover all.
øIf you are just graduating and preparing to look for your first job, this is especially key. Because most likely you have little or no experience. Employers expect that. But experienced or not, employers are gauging how interested you are in the work, how you approach things, whether you can be trusted and how badly you want the job. That's why I picked Rhett. He had it all. And that's why they'd pick you.
"We're getting calls from people who are getting calls from their landlords telling them to move out," said Jen Swanson, executive director at the Baltimore Humane Society in Reisterstown.

My only aggravation is that 15-year-old Cheetah Boy seems to wait until the last minute every night and then throw one day's worth of clothes in the washer. I have asked him 8,012 times not to do this, but apparently his brain cannot think more than 24 hours ahead, unless it involves getting a drivers' license, in which case he can plan years in advance.

That's one reason the administration's explicit endorsement came as a happy surprise. Until now, the White House has expressed support for the wider use of electric vehicles but has basically ignored Merkley's idea. The White House has also focused on building support for a comprehensive energy policy. That effort has failed.

After discussion of the wage reforms, the operations committee turned its attention to transparency, with Foye acknowledging the agency had been criticized for excessive secrecy, sometimes with good reason. Officials said measures include a redrafting of the agency's public records policy, clarifying which records would be made available on request, with examples, and streamlining the appeals process when a request is denied.
The underground has an illustrious past to be sure: A web of Prohibition-era tunnels connecting houses of culture and commerce on one side of Main Street with businesses of lesser repute on the other. A stop on the Underground Railroad at the Quindaro Ruins. The Eighth Street tunnel where streetcar passengers chugged through red-painted brick walls beneath the Quality Hill bluff from 1888 to 1956.

These days, the Twins can't seem to get Hunter out. He has a 13-game hitting streak against his former team and had four RBI hits in the first two games of this week's series, including two home runs. When the Angels threatened in the fifth inning Tuesday, the Twins pitched to Albert Pujols with an open base before intentionally walking Hunter -- now that's respect.

It would have been a shutout had not Cliff Harris decided to field a punt inside his own five, making an over-the-shoulder grab heading into the end zone. He was tackled there for a safety.
A story I wrote for Sunday’s Tribune reports on a small but outspoken group of advocates who are pushing for more data on the risks of giving away a kidney while alive. These living donors have created their own websites and organizations, spoken out on Internet message boards and participated on government advisory groups, giving voice to a group of givers who don’t always feel comfortable talking about problems they have endured as the result of doing a good deed.
It's as simple as that for the Blazers, thanks to New Orleans' two-game slide.

Can we be partners in assisting someone who may need help when that same person has proven himself over the years as a partner, a reliable and efficient employee?"
"It's state law, but I feel it's unconstitutional, it's un-American," Kilbane said in an interview. "They're purging honest, hardworking people from the political process. I'm a tradesman. What kind of bias am I going to display? I work on bridges."

After graduating from South High School, Nelson was drafted into the Army. He served about a year and a half in Europe during World War II in the advanced infantry and military police before he was allowed to go home because his father had died and he had to take care of his family.
Religious zealotry is alien to me - that's why I enjoyed Lightman's thoughtful, generally light touch - but I understand that lots of people are fired up by their own creeds, and hot to impose them upon anybody and everybody, eagerly using any tool at their disposal, from little tracts left in bus station restrooms to fanciful doctrine jammed into public education disguised as legitimate science.
As the story jumps from set-piece to set-piece, one monster to the next, there is no sense of ongoing adventure, just a checklist being ticked off. The mythology of the ancient Greeks is ultimately no match for the industrial imperatives of modern Hollywood.

The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association and American Lung Association wrote Proposition 29, the measure on the June 5 ballot to increase California's cigarette tax by $1 to $1.87 per pack. Lung Association President Jane Warner likes to emphasize the demarcation at play: She's with the good guys, while the bad guys, Big Tobacco, will spend buckets more money trying to fight the measure than her groups will spend trying to pass it.
As a result, contractors have been forced to choose between meeting payroll, compensating suppliers or making good on their obligations to union benefit plans.
Chute fractures her strong prose, fragmenting sentences and splintering the point of view. The book reads like a play for many voices, including that of the planet Pluto and a petulant TV. Icons in the text signal who's talking when, and a catalog of characters helps keep the speakers straight.
With Pressey sidelined by his third foul, Denmon made two of three free throws after being fouled outside the arc to make it 49-46 – MU's biggest lead to that point. But as Norfolk State had done all game, it came right back after a Mizzou move, this time tying it on a Chris McEachin 3.

To join the People-Animal Connection, volunteers have to take a people-only workshop and then be evaluated with their dogs on 24 exercises. "You either pass or you don't," Barron says. The activities may sound simple enough, but not every dog-human combo is cut out for them. "People tell me, 'My dog would be perfect,'" Barron says. "So I ask, 'How many times have you been in an intensive care pediatric unit? How will your dog react? How will you react?'"

Why do smart people love seemingly mindless games? Angry Birds is one of the latest to join the pantheon of "casual games" that have appealed to a mass audience with a blend of addictive game play, memorable design and deft marketing. The games are designed to be played in short bursts, sometimes called "entertainment snacking" by industry executives, and there is no stigma attached to adults pulling out their mobile phones and playing in most places. Games like Angry Birds incorporate cute, warm graphics, amusing sound effects and a reward system to make players feel good. A scientific study from 2008 found that casual games provide a "cognitive distraction" that could significantly improve players' moods and stress levels.
But, as it turned out, it was only the second most common question.
Criticism over Romney’s decision to place Seamus in a dog carrier and strap him to the top of the family’s car during a 12-hour drive to Canada has gone so far as to lead to the creation of a “super PAC” to raise awareness of the incident.
Excerpt: In search of a new way to spend mega-booster T.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Benedict Van of collecting $7 million from investors for two Web-based start-up companies he founded called hereUare and eCity.

But Ready apparently was trying to re-enter politics this year and had formed a committee to seek the Democratic nomination for sheriff in Pinal County.
Outlook: Crennel said last month he wants help on defense, and there are two glaring needs: middle linebacker and tackle. Kuechly would pair well with Derrick Johnson in middle of defense. Two other potential picks are Memphis DT Poe and LSU DT Michael Brockers.

And the Clippers obsession with highlight reels will keep it exciting, but will distract them from their actual focus.

MADRID — The Spanish government's decision to take control of the country's fourth-largest bank highlights the problem gripping the nation's financial system.

SOPA and PIPA also prohibits any technologies that can successfully be used to interfere with the application of the blacklist. So an anonymity tool like Tor becomes a big problem; it masks the IP address of the original source and hides the trail between a series of intermediate anonymous hops. Tor is popularly used by oppressed groups worldwide to safely speak out against local corruption and violence. Its users aren't trying to hide from the MPAA . . . they're trying to conceal themselves from the local chief of police who'll likely kill them on sight for criticizing the government. Under SOPA/PIPA, none of that online traffic would make it into the U.S. with its anonymity intact.

David Vardy led the way overlaying California ingredients with a Japanese sensibility when he opened this Berkeley restaurant 22 years ago. Has it really been that long?

At lunch, you can get bento box lunches.
