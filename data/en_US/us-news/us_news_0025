I agree with the writer that there are many pressing problems facing New Jersey, and America in general, so we need to allow marriage equality, this most basic civil right, to everyone in the country (as so many other nations around the world have done with no breakdown to their societies), so that we can concentrate on those problems. It’s time.
Like most subprime lenders, Quick Loan financed loans based on stated income, known in the industry as "liar loans." The rates were typically adjustable, and could notch up 3 percentage points after two years, driving many borrowers to default if they couldn't refinance.
His style, Harris wrote, "demands that we make up our mind about it. . . . It makes us itch, like ticks on a dog -- the deliberate crudity of syntax and punctuation, sentences telescoped inside one another like railroad cars in a head-on wreck, dialogue blurred into narration, a mongrel mix of formal diction and dialect."

Apple executives say that going overseas, at this point, is their only option. One former executive described how the company relied upon a Chinese factory to revamp iPhone manufacturing just weeks before the device was due on shelves.

Unfortunately, sometimes its our own free will that gets in the way of God's plans. And for that will forever, regrettably be sorry for losing the man who captured my heart.
After all these years  and a lousy economy, repeated appearances at the draft lottery, a run of terrible basketball and business decisions, not to mention that eternal, insufferable arena situation  Sunday started all about the owners and the arena, and ended with a thrilling Kings victory and a familiar postgame locker room visit by Gavin Maloof.
But as the downturn dragged on, he said, it made less and less sense as a home for Stifel. Faced with the prospect of renting in an expensive, brand-new building, or buying its current one at a bargain price, Stifel chose to buy.

The "Loud" tour has been slithering across America for months now, but Rihanna, who sang better than she did on her singles, evinced no signs of exhaustion or boredom. She’s having fun with this, and expects you to feel the same way. And after years of watching male exhibitionists grab their crotches on arena stages, her distaff version felt oddly refreshing.

The group argues that Social Security doesn't contribute to the deficit, which is incorrect. The program paid more in benefits last year than it collected in taxes, and that gap will grow over time. More importantly, by 2037, Social Security won't have enough money to pay its promised benefits, which means today's 50-year-olds are looking at a 25 percent benefit cut in their mid-70s.
The Ducks can salvage something today with David Klech, ninth after the first day of the heptathlon, and Centrowitz coming back in the 3,000.

Abundant special effects will differentiate Spirit of 77 from the typical guy-cave sports hangout. Tall windows connect the space to the adjacent street scene where a new Portland Streetcar line will soon run. Inside the 1912 A.E. Doyle-designed brick building, what could be more Portland-centric than a bicycle parking area and next to it, a coffee and espresso dispensary featuring single-origin espresso shots from local favorite Stumptown Coffee Roasters?

This chain of more than 300 islands is at the westernmost edge of what is considered the Polynesian triangle of the South Pacific (the three tips being Hawaii, Easter Island and New Zealand). But the islanders are a mix of races and cultures, predominantly Melanesian-Polynesian, Indian and the descendants of European settlers. They are gracious, hospitable and friendly. We didn't encounter any resentment toward tourists.

And I do have one final question for Troy Seals:
Arizona has strong mental health laws. Its statutes say mentally ill people are entitled to a full range of services, and that anyone in Arizona can request an evaluation of someone they believe is mentally ill, and authorities must respond. But what laws say and what happens are separate issues.
"I don't want to say it was a setback,'' Showalter said, "but he hasn't healed real well. He's still got some discomfort going on there. He had a couple really good days, thought he was ready to go out, but had a little setback. There's nothing imminent with Cesar."

But for Helen, her daughter's memoir "brought up that old, sickening fear … the dread she used to feel with Dad, of exposure and scandal."
Certain drugs used for children and pregnant women aren't officially approved by the FDA since these groups are difficult to involve in clinical trials. At my office, we treat plenty of these patients every day with medications lacking the approval of the FDA for those uses. We wouldn't have much to treat them with otherwise.
Still, the app has received a lot of favorable press. Since its rollout, Rick Nixon, the project manager for the city, has fielded phone calls from government types in New York and beyond, with callers eager to know how Portland did it.
Harper also had an interesting night on the basepaths. He hit a weak grounder back to Ian Kennedy in the first, but the pitcher's throw was wide and the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 amateur draft took second on what appeared to be an error. The Diamondbacks decided to appeal, and Harper was called out for failing to touch first base.
I have the UO women winning by double digits. This is in marked contrast to the Track & Field News form chart compiled by veteran track writer Jack Pfeifer and reprinted in this morning's R-G. Pfeifer has Texas A&M winning by a point.
For example, the Schwarzenegger administration has argued repeatedly with the federal government that the measurement of noncompliance for the CalWorks work requirement is unrealistic, rigid and inaccurate. Now he's using it to resurrect the specter of rampant welfare "moms." He claims that self-sufficiency reviews could save $1.5 billion a year. In his May revise of the state budget, Schwarzenegger put the number at $100 million.
Oklahoma is sixth.

Neeson is painfully and hysterically awful. You know that's going to happen. Yet the delicious irony is that by being so hysterically awful, Neeson demonstrates how wonderful he is at comedy. Somebody needs to give this guy the chance to do comedy.
"The union is bound by law to defend our members, and we do," said A.J. Duffy, president of United Teachers Los Angeles. "That should in no way deter the resolve of the district to do their job, which is to help failing teachers to get better, or, if they can't, to work to get rid of them."
At least that's the assessment of Nets GM Billy King, who tells the New York Daily News' Stefan Bondy that he has told Outlaw that he needs to be in better shape going into training camp next season.
Pappardelle was also on the menu earlier this month, when Cal Performances hosted a taping of the irreverent PBS show, "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me" at Zellerbach. That time, the al dente pasta ($13.95) was topped with a delicious pork/fennel sausage ragout and accompanied by a vinaigrette-dressed mesclun salad. It was a cold, wet night, so we started with a cup of what three of us agreed was arguably the best split-pea soup we ever tasted ($2.95 when ordered with a main course). It's made from a Greek recipe, using plenty of lemon and oregano.

Recently, Lee watched a golfer on his lunch hour — in work boots in a simulator booth — hit a Rocketballz 3-wood 275 yards — “he said that was 25 yards farther than he’d ever hit his driver,” Lee recalls. He chuckles.
Personal story: "After being the runner up in the IHSA State Track Meet in May 2011, I had made plans to train all summer and fall in order to become a better thrower in the 2012 track and field season and hopefully win a state championship. During the summer of 2011, I suffered an ACL tear during a basketball game. This injury immediatley ceased any plans that I had of training during the summer and also kept me from participating in the other sports that I had always played prior to the injury. After my surgery, I slowly began trying to lift weights and practiced my throwing by sitting in a chair so I wasn't using my legs. Six months later, in January 2012, I was able to participate in track and really begin training for my goals. I currently am still working and competing and have been able to stay pretty consistent with where I left off last season. This injury has been difficult to deal with and a long one to recover from. I do think that it has made me a stronger person and will continue to daily work in order to hopefully achieve my goals. I think that when an individual deals with an obstacle in his/her life, it can truly make that person stronger."

He said he suddenly felt sick. His shoulder was hurting. He heard Michael O'Brien, international president of Transport Workers Union of America, on the news urging local members to return to work immediately. He said he feared losing his health benefits if he walked out. His mind raced, emotions took over.
The old saying "throw the puck on net and good things happen" rang true when Scott Nichol shot from deep on the right wing and Jamie Langenbrunner converted the fat rebound. Given the stellar work of the grinders in this series, it was only appropriate that they put the Blues on the board.
Johnette Howard, ESPN.com: "It was an extraordinary sight when Jets coach Rex Ryan publicly admitted he lost the ‘pulse' of the locker room and vowed to change after they spiraled out of the playoffs last season. But Ryan proved he learned nothing by signing off on the Jets' nonsensical trade for Tim Tebow Wednesday, and then passing on a gift chance to bail on the deal when the two teams hit a financial snag later in the day. It just proves Ryan couldn't find the pulse of his own locker room if he had a stethoscope hooked up to loudspeakers. And neither can his bosses. If anything, this deal proves Ryan has gotten more tone deaf about how to run a team."
Some experts worry that over time, regulators could become lax once again and the industry would exploit the overseers who are least likely to enforce the rules.

While a competitive league option exists, the majority of teams opt for the recreational or recreational plus divisions.
Another possibility is instituting combined reporting measures to plug corporate tax loopholes. Now, multi-state corporations can avoid paying Missouri corporate income tax by headquartering in another state and funneling profits there. At the same time, Missouri's locally owned companies are paying the taxes they owe. Multi-state corporations should contribute to the Missouri services and infrastructure from which they benefit.
If a transportation tax passes in a 2012 referendum, Cobb and Douglas counties want it to fund the interchange at I-285 and Bolton Road, even though that's in the city of Atlanta.

Family members have told police Fernandez went through the gate his father built in the fence between his backyard and the forest preserve Saturday afternoon. When he didn't come back after 45 minutes, family members went out to look for him and found him with what authorities describe as a "puncture wound" to his chest.
"So my books are always like that, struggling between the fact that an individual is trying to carry the weight of the world, he's trying to stand still, he's trying to move forward, but he needs to make a lot of choices in order to fulfill his mission."
Last time, I looked at why something that's bad for us—getting a big tax refund—feels good. Our rational side knows we shouldn't give Uncle Sam an interest-free loan by overpaying our taxes throughout the year, but our emotional side seems to prefer getting a big chunk of change at tax time.
There are so many cars and camera trucks that the Cavs have to have interns pick up media members on golf carts and drive them to the building because of the shortage of parking. There are eight different booths set up for players to have pictures taken and to record videos for the scoreboard at The Q and other promotional projects.
On the positive side, Ichiro Suzuki returning to Japan with the Mariners is a revenue-maker for all. The exposure in Japan and Asia will help MLB, as it banks on fans buying more souvenirs and watching more games on TV.
Kesselring finished in 2 minutes 4.70 seconds.
Let's not mistake incumbent-oriented politics with empowering politics, which is the engine of a healthy democracy. When, for example, Angelenos of Armenian descent argue for a single Armenian-centric district running from Granada Hills to Hollywood, the idea may be unworkable, but it demonstrates a political awakening. When Korean Americans demand a single Koreatown district, even though voters there would be predominantly Latino, it represents a first step in a political coming of age (to be followed, if history is a guide, by a more deft and sophisticated forging of coalitions).
Look at them, the residents of Washington, D.C., moving down the street like sleepwalkers. Civil servants beaten down by the bureaucracy? Elected officials worn down by Senate probes and the 24-hour news cycle?
What do you appreciate most about how this company supports work/life balance?
To save his business, Ike turns to mobster Ben “The Butcher” Diamond (Danny Huston, “X-Men Origins: Wolverine”).
The legislature itself was installed after a 2010 vote that the NLD boycotted and the international community decried as a sham. Now, as a parliamentary minority occupying only a few dozen seats, the Suu Kyi-led opposition will have little power to change what it wants to change most  the constitution, which allots 25 percent of assembly seats to unelected military appointees.
"The fact is 90-percent of Down Syndrome children were aborted in this country."
A doctor who later reviewed Colao’s records on behalf of Era determined the drugs led to his stroke.
The e-mail, received in his personal account, contained photos of four topless women and advertised "Walk Naked for America Day."
"We kept him in the game like crazy on Sunday in the second half," coach John Groce said. "My staff kept saying, 'Whatever you do, do not take him out. He's covering up everything defensively.'"
New York returned to the playoffs last season for the first time since 2004 but lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round. In the offseason, the Knicks radically changed the team, waiving point guard Chauncey Billups through the amnesty clause to free up salary cap space to sign Chandler. They sputtered through January while trying three point guards to replace him.
Proview also has filed suit against Apple in Shanghai and the cities of Shenzhen and Huizhou, according to Xie.

Boulevard's decor and setting - the landmark 1889 Audiffred Building - references the Belle Époque era, but the interior of Prospect is bright and urbane, reflecting its location on the first floor of the new Infinity high-rise. Large windows overlook the street, adding to the urban feel. The restaurant is warm, done mostly in brown and beige tones, and feels open but not cavernous - quite a feat for a place that seats 120 in the dining room, another 46 in the bar, and 45 in a splashy private room.
Chu said in a statement Thursday that Wright has proven an adept leader, accelerating energy efficiency and renewable energy efforts in the Northwest to meet regional and national objectives.
Family tragedies and a love of mustaches created the impetus for an unusual project for two Sidener Academy sixth-graders in Indianapolis Public Schools.
U.S. flat-panel television shipments are expected to dip for the first time on an annual basis this year, ending an unbroken string of growth since the segment first began.
"Physically, I feel really good, and I think some of that is causing me to hesitate a little bit, because I'm able to make plays that I haven't been able to in a while," Roy said. "So I noticed a couple of times I have been second guessing. But physically, I feel great and on the court I think it has been a little up and down, but I'm just trying to play through it. I just have to get my confidence, get my swag back where I have confidence in my game again."
Hours later, he repeated the lie, when detectives came to his house, the Chicago Sun-Times has previously reported.
Performing with Jack Anglin, Wright placed 15 songs in the country top 20 between 1951 and 1962. Their successes included "Ashes of Love," "I Get So Lonely," "Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight" and the Latin-influenced "Poison Love."
"We both play in straight lines," Leipsic said. "We don't go East-West too much. We kind of drive the puck to the net, but we also have some skill and we love to get in on the fore check and create some energy for the team. And that creates chances for us."
And the report swiftly added to pressure on Murdoch's U.S. properties. A Washington-based ethics group called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke 27 Murdoch-owned television licenses, citing the British parliamentary report as evidence the Murdochs fall short of the necessary good character standards to be entrusted with a broadcast license.
"Hopefully, I can be successful as a pro," Johnson said. "I just have to keep working hard, keep getting better."
øThurman, though, can't bring himself to draw any conclusions.
UC Berkeley has won a $60-million grant from the Simons Foundation to establish the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, the University announced Tuesday.
Similarly, bicycles and snorkeling gear are typically available for rent in warmer regions such as the Caribbean or Hawaii.
That's right, the slot I had roughly estimated the Giants to move into is occupied by the team responsible for two of their extra picks this year: No. 45 overall (second round) and No. 151 overall (fifth round) -- the bounty in last year's Jeremy Shockey trade. And better yet, that same team is also lacking picks in the third and sixth rounds because of trades with the Jets and Packers. The Saints have only their first-round pick, two fourths and a seventh. Not good for a team that could really use extra picks to continue to build around their core of players.
Wallace, who lives in Gloucester County, was appointed to Superior Court by Republican Gov. Tom Kean -- Christie's mentor -- and was nominated to the high court by Democratic Gov. Jim McGreevey. In 2003 Wallace succeeded James Coleman Jr., the first black justice on the state Supreme Court.
That would mean putting a higher priority on flood control at the expense of recreation, the environment and endangered species -- a change that the corps at this point appears unprepared to make.

Sunday, May 6: L.A. Lakers at Denver, 9:30 p.m.
Challenges for the city include a 7.4 percent local unemployment rate, an unfunded plan to add a community center and gymnasium to the sports park and the recent state-mandated dissolution of the San Clemente Redevelopment Agency, which will affect the city's ability to fund some future projects, Evert said.
"It sounds like you have a really difficult, (expletive)-up situation here, and it sounds like something that's going to be very hard to fix," he said. "But this next song is all about reaching a breaking point . . . and deciding that something needs to be done."
It helps that Cameron originally filmed “Titanic’’ in a relatively classic style, so there are few of those MTV-like quick cuts that can be so jarring in 3-D, which requires more time for your brain to process edits (so they don’t become a blur).
For example, an enrollment explosion in the last 10 years in the Wentzville School District has made it the state's fastest-growing district. But the growth can be attributed to the city's own boom in population. Increasing enrollment from students moving into the district has slowed in recent years, but Wentzville still expects to add about 400 students in 2010-11.
Sports Illustrated released a story on Monday night that said as many as 28 players over eight years were involved with trading memorabilia for tattoos or money. Nine are players on the current roster not previously named, but the NCAA would have to investigate and find proof of that before adding sanctions.
Chandler Parsons scored a career-high 23 for Houston, which led by as many as 13 in the first half. Parsons tied the game at 83 with a layup late in the fourth, before James' 3-pointer sparked an 8-0 run that put Miami in control.
No one is trying to get out of paying a bill, here. It's just that you want to make sure you're paying your bill, not someone else's. I asked National about your case, and a representative contacted you, and said proper procedures hadn't been followed in your case. They dropped their claim against you.
For this year's show, manufacturers are bringing more of the concept and pre-production cars that can grab the attention of visitors.

"COINTELPRO was still going on at the time of that murder, so it fits the time frame," said David Cunningham, an associate professor at Brandeis University and an expert on the program.
In northern New Jersey, about 2,500 JCP&L customers remain without power, down from 18,000 at the peak of Saturday's windstorm, said John Anderson, a spokesman. A majority of customers still without power will be back online by early evening, he said.

In any case, Hartsfield-Jackson officials no longer cite total passenger forecasts as the motivation for the terminal, though they say the terminal will be needed to accommodate an expected 13 million international passengers in 2015.
This isn't about having a bunch of bad guys in office who are incapable of doing the right thing by us. I suspect a good many are not only capable, but have the best of intentions. Certainly the pressures of a downturned economy haven't helped slow the desire for a development juggernaut to race through our county. It puts them in a tough spot. But we want to be smart about how we grow and an unwillingness to consider dissenting voices isn't smart.
"He was not in uniform. He was not in the City of Portland. He was not on an errand for the City,'' argued Richard J. Kuhn, an attorney representing the city in the civil case. "Instead, he was driving his own personal vehicle in unincorporated Washington County, on an errand for himself, with his infant son of six weeks in the vehicle with him...Nice's motivation leading to his contact with plaintiff was purely personal.''

Comment: Tremendous physical skills. NFL Network's Charley Casserly said Irvin is most explosive player off the ball in the draft. Excelled at combine. Finding a fit for Irvin will be a challenge: He is too small to play end, probably not instinctive enough to play linebacker. Character issues will make teams nervous.
"The announcement today by President Obama should come as no surprise to the American public. President Obama has consistently fought against protecting the institution of marriage from radical social engineering at both the state and federal level." — Former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum.

But paperwork from the Ohio Secretary of State's office shows that Hayes set up a company called "The Stage of Cleveland" on Sept. 20, 2010, and listed Ward as an officer. Hayes also registered a company called "Hayes-Ward & Associates" in July and listed Ward as an officer.
The German-born Goerne brings together elegance, warmth and suppleness of phrasing with the rarified ability to identify with and express the meaning of his material. The Norwegian Andsnes has a sublime way of channeling his technical gifts into music-making that keeps the spotlight on the composer without mortgaging his own spirited personality or intelligence. Both Goerne and Andsnes are storytellers of the first-rank. This promises to be a special evening.
At this point you have a whole mariachi band of flavors for an instant taco party, with guests filling their tortillas with anything they want. They'll want more achiote onions than you have. You can never make enough.

In the lottery of life, we are born into different places not by our own choice and we each have to find our own way to freedom  from artist to poet to dissident to solitary walker. And those journeys make fine holiday reading.
The fried-green tomatoes are back, too. If you've grown indifferent to menu information about sourcing, these might win you back. The firm tomatoes are from George's, just up the road; the mellow goat cheese is from Cherry Glen Farm in Montgomery County, and the smoked bacon and basil are from nearby Truck Patch Farms. None of this dedication would matter if the breading wasn't so tasty and the tomatoes weren't fried so nicely.
Smart said he hopes to use games to close the season against playoff contenders like the Clippers to give the Kings a does of what playoff intensity might feel like.
The male student left with a clean record. If he were to apply to another school, the university would provide no information about the incident unless the other school inquired specifically about allegations of sexual misconduct, according to Geller.
The Passover seder can become a long, boring evening at which even the dinner menu may divide families more than unite them. That's because, aside from the question of what's kosher literally, there's the matter of what a family considers traditional or customary. And that often varies depending on where the family emigrated from.

The gathering at Dolores Park, a pre-May Day celebration, led to a march down Mission District streets, Smith said.
Hurwitz's endorsers include well-known judges such as Francisco Briseño, James Rogan, William Froeberg and Nancy Wieben Stock; Democratic and Republican politician-lawyers such as Dick Ackerman and Joe Dunn; and attorneys with such diverse practices as Wylie Aitken (personal injury) and Carl Holmes (criminal defense).
Underwood enjoys rage; her huge voice, both naive and muscular, is well suited to it. Her best songs have historically been in the range between fury and resentment. "Blown Away" is only her fourth album, but that number belies her concrete-hard place in the country firmament, with a combination of vocal ambition and toughness that recalls a younger Martina McBride.
HOWELL — Born at just 29 weeks' gestation and weighing in at 1.78 pounds, Mary Catherine Mulvaney was called "Miracle Mary" by the nurses in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune.
Wright, now 68, escaped from a minimum security prison wing in New Jersey in 1970, and wound up in Michigan. He joined the Black Liberation Army and was part of a group of four who hijacked a Delta Airlines plane to Algeria in 1972, according to the FBI.
Translation for the interview below provided by friend of OregonLive.com Théophile Haumesser. Why did you choose Nancy specifically?
That's all fine and well if both partners are happy with the new order of things. More often, however, vanishing sex lives cause couples distress -- especially if mismatched desire leaves one person feeling routinely rejected, and the other incessantly hounded, perpetuating a nasty cycle of resentment.
øThe new version of FCP X is still missing some baffling things. The most notable: for a program that wants to appeal to consumers, why would you still not offer the ability to create chapter menus on DVDs? (Which was possible on Final Cut 7.) Apple offers a workaround by doing it in the $49.99 add-on Compressor, which lets you save videos in different formats, but come on guys - how hard can this addition really be?
"When they found him, he had no electricity and no running water in his house," said David Anders, 58, a retired district fire chief. "He was a proud enough man that he wouldn't accept help."
"You find good and bad with each of them — from political baggage to not living in the neighborhood for as long as they should, as far as I'm concerned. Living here for five, six years, and you want to represent 75,000 people? That's not good enough for me," said Grasso, who said he didn't think a renter should be able to be on the council. "Every one of them has something I don't like about them."

Contrary to museum consultants' claims, the public has a continuing fascination with the homes of famous citizens, in Baltimore and elsewhere. The James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and the Mark Twain House in Hartford, Conn., are two shining examples of highly attended writers' house museums. The public's interest exhibited in recent weeks shows that the home of H.L. Mencken could be another example of that success.
After a rough childhood, Mfume decided to change his life, graduating magna cum laude from Morgan State University and earning a master's degree from John Hopkins University. Born Frizzell Gray, he legally changed his name to Kweisi Mfume, meaning "Conquering Son of Kings" in the early 70s. Mfume was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1978, and served seven terms in the U.S. House. In 1996, Mfume left Congress to accept the presidency of the NAACP, and now consults for the organization.

After two stints in jail and rehab, Yelena was clean for more than half a year before being arrested in October on an outstanding warrant. Her parents and siblings are U.S. citizens, but Yelena never took the examination. As a green-card holder, she is deportable for drug-related offenses.
Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department, said that for some women, greater career ambition means less free time and a decline in overall happiness. In studies, she has shown that as early as high school, women begin pressuring themselves to excel at work and extracurricular activities. Even at 18, they are "structuring their days more and more in pursuit of all these goals and not leaving as much time to just hang out," she said.

Josh Marks, outside counsel for Loveland, said medical-pot shops are similar to fireworks stands. "If there is a fire ban, and the city shuts down the fireworks stand, the owner can't say they have a vested right to sell fireworks."

For some reason, I remember the early logo on their sign: a jolly, fat cartoon king sitting on a huge hamburger throne. As I recall it now, the character looked kind of like a cleaned-up, dressed-up Homer Simpson wearing a crown. Maybe the image is fixed in my brain because I went back there so many times. For a few years, that particular Burger King was an extremely popular hang out for mid-county high schoolers of my era.
The diocese's statement said the letter "was never intended to be a finished product by any means, but rather a starting point for what was to be a confidential initial conversation between the bishop and his closest priest advisors."
Researchers also found that 51 percent of San Diego's restaurants are fast food eateries, compared with 25 percent nationwide and 49 percent statewide. Studies have shown a link between easy access to fast food and a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The study also found that 4 percent of San Diegans have limited access to healthy food, defined as living less than a mile from a grocery store in metropolitan counties and less than 10 miles in non-metropolitan counties.
"This is truly a problem if nearly one-third of our population is getting less than six hours," Mehra says. "It's an incredible health issue with huge implications," which include its contributing to diseases like diabetes and hypertension, as well as mood disorders and obesity.
It is unbelievable that Ficano would now put forth an ethics policy to stop himself from continuing the abuses that he has created. He is insulting all of the voters of Wayne County. He must think that the voters are both stupid and gullible.
Proponents said the project would have created 6,000 construction-related jobs a year and close to 45,000 permanent jobs once completed. They also said it would have provided transfer-free rides to Manhattan, gotten 22,000 cars off the roads every day and eliminated nearly 70,000 tons of greenhouse gasses gases each year.
"If you try to lie or manipulate or outfox this guy, he’s coming back at you with a nuclear vengeance," said Sen. Kevin O’Toole (R-Essex). But in the end, both sides got some political fodder: a formula for demonizing each other as the election season heats up.

None of the three who have gotten the most support so far this year — Perry, Romney and Bachmann — said they favored repealing the prescription drug benefit in Medicare, which has a large unfunded liability.

Greene showed that power in a burst during batting practice this morning at Busch. He and Indiana outfielder Dickerson were in the same hitting group, and witnesses saw a little bit of a duel develop. Dickerson asked Greene at one point where he went to school, and was a bit surprised to hear it was a high school. Greene, a lefthanded-hitting prospect, peppered a few shots into the right-field seats, and afterward he acknowledged that he and the other hitters in his group were going for distance, not number of homers.

Seattle journalist Blaine Harden spent more than two years interviewing before writing "Escape From Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey From North Korea to Freedom in the West." This is a collaborative attempt to bring Shin's story to the English speaking world. But Harden also brings considerable investigative skills to bear. He weighs and probes the likely truth of his subject's account, seeking out as much backing evidence as he can find.
Now we are trying to grow our utilities too big. When Exelon gobbles up Constellation Energy and Baltimore Gas and Electric Co., who will lose? Baltimore will lose, big time. When Exelon decides to cut back departments and workers, where do you suppose those people will be cut? From Baltimore of course. Exelon is a Chicago company. Baltimore will naturally be the first place to cut. Cut jobs. Cut services. Cut power supplies. But don't look for them to cut any executive salaries; in fact the Exelon CEO is set to receive a $21 million dollar bonus when BGE becomes another Exelon satellite.
"Ours is not to reason why. Ours is to receive the material, put it back into circulation and let other people be as astounded as we are that the material is here. That it can be used and it's beautifully made and you can't get the wood anymore and they don't make it like that anymore," Drobinsky said.

He worked with Morhmann in "Boy Gets Girl" at Capital Stage, and the former student said working with Murphy in college always resulted in growth.
24. Kendall Reyes, DT, Connecticut, 6-4, 299. Still on the upswing in his career curve, especially given how he pushed around some of the nation's best offensive linemen at the Senior Bowl workouts. A team captain, he played both end and tackle in his career. He had 31 ½ tackles for loss in 42 career starts.
Finnegan said all proceeds after kickoff-party expenses will go to Operation Home Front of Arizona, which provides aid and support to military families.
The easier solution is to place a statue in the plaza outside US Airways Center, where Colangelo shaped the small-market Suns into a model NBA franchise. That property is owned by the city of Phoenix, and does not require team approval.

The Packers sacked him nine times in the two games this season and pressured him countless other instances. The protection, though, has dramatically improved, and the Bears are hopeful they can have the sort of turnaround that they did against the Seattle Seahawks.
Next, work on establishing a positive credit history from this point forward. The good news is that derogatory items on your credit report from the past, including bankruptcy or short sales, will not be there forever, and your most recent payment history has a larger impact on your score than older data have.

Continental employees interpreted that to mean that United workers would have more protection from layoffs when the airlines combined workforces.
The Jets took their only lead with 1:20 remaining in the first half, after a 2-yard touchdown run by Sanchez gave his team a 9-6 advantage. But before that play, Sanchez made a mistake that proved quite costly: He heard the coaches on the headset talking about a time out, but he called it too soon, with double-digits left on the play clock.
Answer: Plant choices that are evergreen, sun loving, tall and provide privacy screening include Arizona rosewood (Vauquelinia californica), hopbush (Dodonaea viscosa), Mexican bird of paradise (Caesalpinia mexicana) and orange jubilee (Tecoma orange jubilee). All these should do well with your parameters, and the last two have showy flowers.
Trout impressed me, but not nearly as much as Harper. After watching his debut, I knew that was a scorecard I had to save. The other keeper, of course, came Wednesday night, when Jered Weaver threw his no-hitter against the Twins.
The long, windowless tunnels between cell blocks, often used in the past for sex, aren't regularly patrolled and have no cameras. Some rooms, such as a janitor's closet, still await the addition of windows.
SECOND QUARTER
"Starting from Day 1 in preseason, we said we're not going to be a pushover, we won't get scored on easily, and there won't be silly goals against us," said Earthquakes coach Frank Yallop, whose team finished last in the Western Conference last year at 7-14-9. "If you cut out most of those silly goals in a season, you have a chance to win games."
Pioneer scored two runs in the first and single runs in the second and third in the win.
The White House's plan was to run for re-election in 2012 with a soaring economy at its back. After an absolutely bruising recession (that was in some ways worse than the one Obama inherited), Reagan got to ride a surging economy to re-election. America enjoyed 6 percent annual growth in 1984: In three of the four quarters before Election Day, GDP quarterly growth was more than 7 percent, while inflation and unemployment plummeted.
So far, the idea of an actual Tequila Party seems to be solely embraced by comedians and other wisecrackers. George López has said on his TBS talk show that he will be running for President under its banner, promising to campaign across the country in a 1966 sky-blue El Camino and guaranteeing that under his administration all bottles of tequila will cost only $3.

Whenever God veers toward a command approach, humanity pushes back: Abraham's withdrawal from God, Job's protests, Moses' reminder to God of His past promises to Abraham, Isaac and Israel that their descendants would be a great nation.
The city is -- finally -- in the process of fixing this problem. So there's a new opportunity for residents to begin to see our waterways as amenities, not stinky, disgusting things to stay away from at all costs.
Saturday morning, it meant just as much to their mom to see Josh, 9, and Tyler, 6, hustling around the bases in the gym at Century College in White Bear Lake. The brothers have hypotonia, a condition that can affect physical and cognitive development. But with their Miracle League season just weeks away, they were eager to sharpen their skills at a clinic hosted by Century's fledgling baseball team.

In the meeting, Obama outlined options for a short-, medium- and long-term package of deficit cuts, according to a congressional aide familiar with the talks. The smallest package, $2 trillion, would be made up mostly of spending cuts already identified in talks led last month by Vice President Joe Biden. The maximum would be a $4.5 trillion deal. Obama also said he would veto any short-term fix that would require Congress to vote on the debt ceiling again this year or next. At the meeting, no one favored the smallest option, officials said.
He withdrew after 11 holes of the final round at Doral with tightness in his left Achilles tendon, the same one that caused him to miss three months last year. Two weeks later, he ended 30 months without a PGA Tour victory when he won by five shots at Bay Hill. That made him a favorite at the Masters, where he tied for 40th and was harshly criticized for kicking a club after a poor tee shot on the 16th hole.
Davis should know. He has a track record of breaking in first-time head coaches -- seven in all -- and knows what makes a good one. His newbie list dates all the way back to Bill Cowher in 1992 and includes former Browns coach Chris Palmer in 1999. Two of Davis' first-timers went on to coach in Super Bowls -- Pittsburgh's Cowher and Arizona's Ken Whisenhunt.

How it works: A mugger with a pair of scissors cuts the purse right off your back and walks off with it in broad daylight. It can happen so quickly and easily in a crowded place — such as a subway or mobbed amusement park — that you might not even notice right away.
The Pac-10 wanted to invade Texas, which has two Top 10 markets (No. 5 Dallas-Fort Worth and No. 10 Houston), but ended up adding only Colorado and Utah. It thus gets Denver, the nation's 16th-largest market, and No. 31 Salt Lake City.
Moore recorded a double-double with 10 points and 10 assists, but he was just 3 for 16 from the field. Brock Motum led WSU with 18 points, and Capers added 14 points and eight rebounds.

I'm pretty sure last season went through everybody's mind, Nielsen said by phone. But we've matured a lot from last year and I think we played smarter than we did in the previous game up here. Overall, it was a good win for us and an important win.
The show also shared some of the shortcomings of horror movies. Odd Future's emphasis on nonstop outrage can feel monotonous; the umpteenth exhortation to kill people and burn stuff doesn't have anywhere near the same power to shock that the first one does. The show started off so frenetic -- Hodgy Beats pitched himself into the crowd during a performance of Mellowhype's hit "64," losing his microphone in the process -- that the pace was difficult to sustain. This would bode ill for Odd Future's career if there was nothing to the act but shock value. Yet even as they're driving the censors batty, the group is artful: the productions, mostly by Tyler and Left Brain, are musically adventurous and sometimes gorgeous in their cobwebby creepiness. A mosh pit at the Wellmont is probably not the best place to access the subtlety of Tyler's music. But the production remains the most interesting thing about Odd Future, and it's likely going to be where Tyler concentrates his energies once he tires of all the provocation.
The refunds will apply to people who bought tickets before the FAA shutdown began on July 23 and then traveled during the shutdown. Passengers who bought tickets after the shutdown began didn't pay the taxes anyway. They paid higher fares instead.
NEW YORK — Curtis Granderson felt like something just wasn’t right. For whatever reason, his timing at the plate had just been off this season. So before he took the field against the Minnesota Twins Thursday night, he took some extra batting practice with hitting coach Kevin Long standing behind him offering a yay or nay for each hack.
Her comments stood out because General Electric’s federal income taxes have been a matter of dispute. Did the Connecticut-based company, with $14.2 billion in earnings, avoid paying any U.S. corporate income taxes for 2010?

Only eight teams in NBA history have come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a seven-game series. Top-seeded San Antonio awaits the winner in the conference semifinals.
Santorum's conservatism has some jagged edges, which has elevated Romney's polling numbers among women. But it is difficult for Romney himself to press this case without sounding like a Massachusetts social liberal. He can only employ proxies and raise the general issue of electability. Barack Obama would be under no such constraints.
We've never quite been believers of UCLA at any point this season. And in spite of Sparty's failings (there have been a lot of them), we did pick them in the preseason as a Final Four team. The fact that Team Izzo seems to be finally turning the corner only encourages us to stay with the decision. Michigan State 62-54.

Not to get all theological, but for anyone who filched God's Holy Word from their room (at least the ones that weren't meant to be taken), I would advise you to return it at your earliest convenience. I don't even want to think about the punishment that awaits you now -- or in the hereafter.

This is exactly what Oregon demands from its university system, which it consistently starves every appropriation cycle. The state's public colleges are doing more with less and less support from the state.
Hankerson said he was somewhat shocked that his company has been spared any negative impact from the economy. The uniqueness of his pieces is partly responsible.
ORLANDO, FLA. — Taking your older teenagers to Orlando for spring break might seem like an odd choice — aren't they a little old for Disney? Yes, our 16- and 18-year-olds are a bit jaded for Mickey Mouse, but we saw a last-minute trip to Orlando as a chance to hold our kids hostage for some family fun.
NEW YORK - Stocks plunged Friday after the government reported that hiring slowed sharply last month. The report confirmed investors' fears that the U.S. economic recovery may be faltering.

With the shuffle, the odds and the various protocols for playing constantly shifting, a blackjack table in Las Vegas tells you a lot about the hosting casino. Some give players a fighting chance; others are out there to fleece any poor fool. Here is an incomplete snapshot of a few casinos and the games that were offered two weeks ago.
More than $182 million has been raised for the arts center’s endowment, operations, upkeep and cash reserve, NJPAC officials said. Although more than $80 million has already been used to subsidize the arts center’s annual operations, the funds provide a safety net for the institution as well as reserves for capital improvements and upkeep, they said.

A universal federal postal system guarantees delivery (and pickup) to every corner of this expansive land. Not every person has access to the Internet  or even to a phone  but every person has a right to send a letter and get a letter by U.S. mail. It is a genuinely public good.

“That pretty much put the icing on the cake for me,” she said of Martin, who built a consistent winner at Kansas State. “He knows what it is to come from a one-parent home. He wasn’t the best kid, either. He pretty much identified himself with Thaddeus.”
About to be made to walk the plank, Darwin suddenly notices something peculiar about the captain's beloved parrot Polly. With his own nefarious aims in mind, Darwin, or Chuck as the captain takes to calling him, convinces the credulous pirate that taking this strange bird to London — and risking the wrath of the pirate-phobic queen, thrillingly voiced by Imelda Staunton — will make him a wealthy man. As if.
The main attraction Saturday was the grouping of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Lee Trevino in an exhibition run in conjunction with the tournament itself. Palmer curled in a 25-foot birdie putt on the final hole, prompting a roar from the massive gallery that followed the greats all day.
Basketball legend Michael Jordan has filed a lawsuit in China against a Chinese sportswear company, accusing the firm of unauthorised use of his name.
Remember all the draft savants who said the Bulls should take Michael Beasley, and not Rose, with that 2008 first pick? Beasley was a 6-9 scoring machine; Rose was a mere 6-21/2 point guard. Wrong.
Higher: Sarah Hendrickson, of Park City, Utah, clinched the inaugural women's World Cup ski-jumping title Saturday in Japan. The 17-year-old phenom has won eight of the 12 competitions this season.
Even without such bonuses, the East End is an increasingly interesting place to be. On a visit to London early this year, I spent most of my time in the East End neighborhoods of Shoreditch, Hoxton, Spitalfields and Brick Lane that lie roughly midway between central London and the new Olympic Park, eight miles east at Stratford.

Council members have made it clear they would prefer to select at least one city resident as one of two council appointees to the joint state-city financial advisory board that will have broad powers over the citys finances. The board will work with Mayor Dave Bings staff and the council to shape annual budgets that dont exceed Detroits revenues, as part of the April 4 consent deal that avoided an emergency manager but gave the state significant oversight of the citys finances.
Meyers acknowledges the sleight of hand in this. "They call it 'free cancellation,' but you're paying extra for it," he said.
"The nonprofit sector employs more women than men, so this may be a field where women have an advantage and can really shine," Kinney says. "However, research shows that women may face the same barriers to attaining executive positions as women in other sectors."
For Dungeness crab or Oktoberfest bratwurst, locals gather at Reedville Cafe, formerly a rough and tumble biker bar called The Shack. Owner Rick Van Beveren said some look down their nose at strip malls, but he appreciates the diversity and independent businesses made possible by real estate cheaper than places such as Orenco Station in Hillsboro.
The true bits of juicy news are the non-local visits. Teams may bring in up to 30 players from outside of the area for visits. While many teams might use such sit-downs as smoke screens, the Giants have been pretty genuine with their interest in those players in recent years. (Jerrel Jernigan and Jacquian Williams were among the players who visited last year. In 2010, the Giants drafted four players who came in for visits, including Jason Pierre-Paul.)
Two weeks before the audit's release, Hayes pleaded for more time to collect documents. In a letter, Hayes said he never intended to charge the government for his buyout payments and that his company faces numerous "resource problems" and turnover in the finance department.

Horak was a plus-two and logged 17:39 in ice time Friday.
What prompted the decision to send the letters, Walsh said, was evidence that medical marijuana is being diverted to youths. For instance, a report published last year by Denver Health drug-treatment doctor Christian Thurstone found that, of 80 kids admitted for substance-abuse treatment, nearly half said they had received marijuana from someone with a medical-marijuana license.
"Although JetBlue has already taken several steps to minimize the impact of this closure on its JFK operations, this exemption is necessary to ensure that JetBlue is not penalized if JFK becomes gridlocked at peak operating times," the airline said in its request to DOT.
The back breaker that sent most of the 18,382 headed into the warm Southern California night was a hot-potato three-pointer from Aldridge -- caught and released in a hurry in order to beat the shot clock.

Vines is a Christian, a 22-year-old Harvard undergrad raised in a conservative evangelical church in Kansas. He is also gay and says he grew up being taught that the Bible condemns his sexual orientation. He took two years off from school to research and study whether or not that assertion is true.
I wandered into the shop, filling my lungs with the rich wafts of coffee. The man behind the counter gave me a bemused look; his eyes flickered. I asked for a latte. He shrugged, the milk steamer whined, and he handed over the brimming paper cup. I turned my back on his uneasy face.

The crowd of 46,882 that attended Friday's home opener was the second-largest in Busch Stadium III history, but because of the team's "dynamic pricing'' of tickets - in which prices rise with demand - it set a record for one-game revenue at the six-year-old ballpark.
Unlike lead actors, supporting actors are pushed into a single category whether they do drama or comedy, which presents the hilarious spectacle of Sofia Vergara of Modern Family facing off against Maggie Smith of Downton Abbey, while Eric Stonestreet (also of Modern Family) stares down Guy Pierce of HBO's Mildred Pierce miniseries.

Revenue increased 23% to $14.88 billion, although that growth was only 9.6% on a pro forma basis, in which the numbers are accounted as if the NBCUniversal acquisition was effective on Jan. 1, 2010. Comcast acquired a majority stake in NBCUniversal at the end of January last year.
The board cited a three-part test to determine whether an arbitrator's award is unenforceable: First, did the arbitrator find the employee guilty of misconduct for which discipline was imposed? If so, did the arbitrator reinstate, or relieve the person of responsibility for the misconduct? And, lastly, if so, is there a clearly defined public policy, expressed in state law or a court decision, that makes the award unenforceable?
Early yesterday, the Vatican said that the pope was suffering from heart failure - a weak heart - and that his kidney's were shutting down. All of this is typical for a patient succumbing to septic shock.

The Giguieres farm 40 acres of tempranillo, perhaps more than any other grower in California. And across Road 92B from Crew Wine Co., they've ripped 400 acres of a newly acquired 2,100-acre spread for additional vineyards and olive orchards, including 30 more acres of tempranillo. (Slightly less than 1,000 acres of tempranillo are grown in California.)
"When you think about what it costs to house a family in an emergency shelter — $6,000 or $7,000 a month for four people — instead, we can provide rental assistance for $600," she said.

If you're transitioning your outdoor cat to stay indoors, do it cold turkey, Cornwell says. Depriving a cat of its outside turf gradually is stressful for them because other animals will claim their territory.
Wetzel may be the best defensive outfielder in Northeast Ohio. He also owns the school record for stolen bases and triples. This past season he hit .553 with 41 RBIs, 57 hits and 24 stolen bases.
None more so than Beasley, who tied a Timberwolves record for the most points by a player off the bench. He had his way with everyone the Rockets put on him.
But as quickly as the Wildcats gained the momentum, it took just 10 seconds to deflate their balloon. Wade took the ensuing kickoff back 76 yards, and the Wolves made sure to slam the door on Fleming's hopes.

Transportation Department officials acknowledged the incident was a major factor in their decision to impose a 4-hour limit on tarmac delays for international flights. Airlines that break the rule can be fined up to $27,500 per passenger -- more than $10 million for a fully loaded superjumbo jet like an Airbus A380 -- although the government has never imposed anything close to the maximum.

Tonight’s episode showed us a glimmer of Emily’s heart when she took back the DVD that would have revealed David Clarke as Charlotte’s father. Aside from this moment, however, it was hard to believe that there was any feeling inside her. Her lack of compassion for Jack and Amanda, as well as her complete disregard for Nolan’s warnings make it seem as if she is also manipulating the Jack situation. Yes, Amanda out of the picture works out for Emily’s ultimate revenge plot, but it also leaves Jack able to continue to pine.

Harry was shot down over Berlin on Sept. 12, 1944. His plane had been attacked by German fighters, and the crew was killed or rendered unconscious. "I was the only one who woke up in time (to parachute out)," Sellers said. He was captured and taken to Stalag Luft 1 in Barth, Germany. Two weeks earlier, on Aug. 29, my father's B-17 had been downed by German fighters. He, too, parachuted out safely and was taken to Barth.

Hiring an architect isn't cheap. Depending on the scope, the general rule of thumb is that you will pay anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the construction value of your project. How much will you spend on construction costs? That depends, too, on the kind of project and the level of detail. Mike Bader said that bathrooms and kitchens, which include plumbing fixtures, custom cabinets and expensive floor coverings and tiles, can easily cost $300 a square foot. Expect to pay about $150 a square foot for more straightforward living spaces and bedrooms.

Opportunity presented itself when "urban pioneers" Steve Borkenhagen and Bob Mello invited Rathmann to help open the Camera One Theater when pimps and hookers were prancing up and down South First Street. The trio then opened Eulipia Restaurant in 1977, placing it in the heart of the city's budding SoFa art and music district. During Rathmann's 14 years at Eulipia, the restaurant donated space for theatrical productions, poetry readings and thousands of dollars in dinners for art events.

Christmas is a time for wines that you can enjoy through the day, so dig into the cellar (or the closet) for those special bottles you've been saving. Never was there a better time to share. It's also a time for more opulent flavors; as wonderful as a racy Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio (with a few exceptions) may be, you want wines that stand up to the sort of lavish recipes that require one last bit of traditional belt-loosening before the new year. If you want one all-purpose wine to serve during the day, choose Champagne. But why choose one wine?
While Jay Cutler's absence has been disastrous, the Bears have had much better luck replacing injured Matt Forte. Kahlil Bell became the third Bears running back to rush for 100 or more yards in a game this season when he gained 121 on 23 carries last week against the Packers. In four games since Forte was injured, Bell has rushed for 260 yards on 47 carries (5.5 per carry). Armando Allen added 40 yards on 11 carries against the Packers as the Bears ran for 199 yards to move up to eighth in the NFL (128 ypg). Josh McCown gained 38 yards on eight carries in his first start for the Bears. The Vikings are sixth in yards per carry allowed (3.9).

"It went from $5 billion to $8.7 billion in what was clearly a rush by the Corzine administration to have gold shovels and put them the ground and try to get (former Gov. Jon) Corzine re-elected. That obviously was less than successful," Christie said. "And I’m concerned that their evaluations of price of this project was as successful as his re-election campaign was."
“Roughly one half of one percent of those who turn themselves in will be returned to custody. And for those who think amnesty is being offered, that is not the case. We are not offering amnesty, we are only helping those who come forward and take responsibility for their crimes.”
Those enticements, for Minnesota, seem to far outweigh the fact that one of the Gophers biggest priorities is resurrecting a limping football program, and Teague, who has 20 years of experience working in collegiate athletics, most recently comes from a school that did not even have a football or hockey program.
At the engagement party the complications begin in earnest, with the filmmakers throwing everything conceivable, literally and figuratively, in their way. The hurdles designed to test their relationship (and our patience) also provide all the subplots and ancillary roles for this sprawling cast. The two most significant snags come from near — courtesy of Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violet's sister Suzie (Alison Brie); and far — a University of Michigan teaching fellowship, with Ann Arbor about as far as they could get from a San Francisco state of mind.

Exasperation over the growing public health implications of pollution inspired the call for environmental education and led to the first Earth Day celebration on April 22, 1970. Millions of Americans spanning diverse social, political and economic spectrums joined together, both in service and to protest the effects of oil spills, air pollution, raw sewage, toxic dumps, pesticides and wildlife extinction on American landscapes, waterways and skies. This movement ultimately resulted in the creation of the EPA and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. Legislation soon followed to address the nation's drinking water supply, hazardous waste management and toxic waste cleanups.
"Bamboo is really nice to look at and it has a pleasant rustling sound in a breeze that reminds me of white noise," said Jeff Schalau, an agricultural and natural resources agent with University of Arizona Cooperative Extension at Prescott.

Privately, Christie also told people that Wallace's interview with him did not go well and further discouraged him from reappointment.
We know that innocent people have been convicted of murder in California – three were released in 2011 after serving a total of 57 years – and that innocent people have been executed in other states. Nationwide, 140 inmates from death rows have been exonerated of the crimes for which they were wrongly convicted. In light of possible innocence, using the death penalty puts all Californians at risk of perpetrating the ultimate injustice of executing an innocent person, for when the governor gives the final order to execute, he does so in the name of California residents, and the death certificate will read, "Homicide," as the cause of death.
The strategy worked, the union said. As proof, it distributed a memo it attributed to Anamaria Pavoni, a Hugo Boss executive.
"He never gives up on any child," Peek said. "Some of these kids don't have one supportive person believing in them. Everyone needs someone to believe in them. As a child, he had a tough time and knows a lot of these kids are in the same way. Some days are hard, extremely difficult for him. But he never lets on and never gives up. And that's what he brings to the children - to never give up. Life isn't always going to be fair."

For the game, Ohio State ran 37 times for 190 yards and threw 18 passes and completed four for 35 yards. That's twice as many runs as throws, but in the end, even 18 passes may have been too many.

That might seem to reflect badly on the employees who are now in paid limbo, many of whom are, no doubt, blameless and talented educators. Yet the investigation was going to continue, with questioning of all the staff. Students and their parents would have spent the semester wondering: Who's in trouble? Who can be trusted? That too makes it hard to get on with the business of educating. There might be no way to salvage a happy academic year for Miramonte, but Deasy is doing his best to make sure it's at least a safe one for students.
Johnson's attorney works for the same law firm that employs the son of Paul Ahler, who is Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley's pick for chief deputy.
The competing tax cut proposals will likely play center stage as the Legislature takes up Christie’s $32.1 billion budget in a series of hearings beginning in early March.

Only four patrol offices -- Portland, Salem, Central Point and Bend -- reached the 24/7 standard, and that was on paper. The hiring didn't account for gaps caused by vacations, training and other absences. The new bodies went first to offices along Interstate 5, then along I-84 and U.S. 97, through Central Oregon. Coastal offices along U.S. 101 were to be next for more troopers.

1. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver): "Alien" - At the top of our list we've got a woman so tough that mere humans aren't enough of a challenge for her. Over the course of four movies, Ripley continually bests murderous space monsters and a cold foreboding cosmos where no one can hear you scream. Ripley pretty much redefined the role of women in the sci-fi/action genres taking them from victims or damsels in distress to tough-as-nails lone survivors. She is the queen and we are all her subjects.

Today would have been Ronald Reagan's 101st birthday. If Republicans want to honor his legacy, we should remember the man he really was — not the myth we've created to advance our personal interests. If we can emulate the decency, civility, good will and patriotism that was Ronald Reagan — and live the 11th Commandment — we can truly honor him in the second century after his birth and make America that gleaming city on the hill that he dreamed of.

First came the Lugar campaign's cryptic promise of "critical" new information about Mourdock that would prove he wasn't a conservative.

Last week I spoke to a political group. Any community where people are trying to proceed in a more constructive and rational way can be useful. It's really in schools, from kindergarten through graduate schools, where people have the best opportunity to understand how to sort out realistic claims from exaggerated ones and learn how to think critically.
Start off with banh xeo, a rice-flour crepe studded with shrimp and pork. A pair of salads - spicy beef salad and green papaya - practically redefine the category. Inhale the fragrance of pho, beef broth stocked with sirloin, brisket and meatballs. Noodles like rice vermicelli with marinated pork and sausage go where other noodles rarely go. And the scent from crispy lemongrass chicken is as alluring as Chanel No. 5.

"They’re either ill-informed or they’re not telling the truth, and they know that they’re not telling the truth when they make the assertion," Reed said.

Gaymon, who everyone called "Dean," returned to New Jersey because he was the organizer of his high school's 30-year reunion, which took place Friday night.
I often watch the TV show "Animal Patrol," not for the sensationalism, but to help me wrap my head around the fact that we, human beings, can say we love our pets, and starve them, allow them to be flea- and tick-infested, dehydrated, tied to a tree in severe weather, frozen to trees, bred all their lives from their first heat never knowing what human touch feels like, thrown out of cars unwanted and allowed to wander aimlessly and confused, hit by cars and left by the side of the road, taught to attack just because their owner thinks it's macho, puppies and kittens acquired only because they're cute, households with pets living in their own feces.

Spain's regions accounted for the bulk of the government's 2011 budget overrun and are a reason why the country has seen borrowing costs soar in recent days. The government is aiming to cut the budget deficit from 8.5% of gross domestic product in 2011 to 5.3% this year.

Automated calls go out to thousands of people in a radius around the pet's last known location. I'd never heard of such a thing, but it's totally cool, and one tip came from that. At least they knew he was still in the area, still alive. At one point, Christy and Ryan even worked with an animal psychic, who suggested places to look and assured them they would find their beloved dog before they left town.
If the answer is, we want to do both things, or rather we want to accomplish the former by means of the latter, then I would answer that it isn't necessary to make people thinner to improve their health -- which is a very good thing, given that we don't know how to make people thinner.

The Democrats who made political hay of Issa's choice of witnesses were right; surely it says something troubling that the committee didn't bother to find a single woman to testify on its first panel. (There were two on the second.) But it is at least as troubling that there was no one at all — male or female, on either panel — called to testify in support of the Obama administration's proposed mandate.

"He is night and day from last year," Cutelli said. "And he's as tall as he was last year, but he's added some size and bulkiness. He's definitely a lot more physical in the sense that he's able to go in and, if someone is guarding him, he's able to shrug them off and make a move with the ball. Last year, if someone bigger was on him, it was a struggle for him to get loose and turn and get a shot off."
Goldschmidt had gone 88 at-bats since his last home run, which came in the first inning of the season opener against Giants ace Tim Lincecum. Goldschmidt also had a pair of infield singles on Friday, his three hits tying a career best.

But can it really be done at home? As daunting as it might seem to make your own infusion, Gaber, who has been making her own liqueurs since 2006, says it requires only a few steps. Lavender, rose, jasmine and any number of fruits will give vodka a lovely hint of their flavor; use dried flowers (which you can get from Whole Foods) for intense flavor, and let it sit for at least a week (refrigerate if you're using fruit).

Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., says he has the votes to pass it in his chamber — though only under special budget rules requiring just a simple majority vote.

For centuries, American Indian tribes have banished people as punishment for serious offenses.

Burned out by his work in the South, Evans took a job as a writer and editor with Time Magazine and, later, Fortune magazine. But it was during this time that he produced one of his great projects -- although it wasn't published until 1966, years after the photos were shot. The so-called "Subway Series" is made up of penetrating portraits of average New Yorkers riding underground, caught by a camera Evans kept hidden under his coat. It is a reflection of something Evans wrote in 1960: "Stare. It's the way to educate your eye. Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop."
A police statement said the two men had gotten into altercations several times in recent years. The family wants Kelley charged with premeditated first-degree murder, not second-degree murder, with a hate crime allegation, Galindo said.

øTAKIN' IT EASY: For their first-ever Fest appearance, country-rock titans the Eagles opened with a near-a capella version of Seven Bridges Road to send the message that their gorgeous harmonizing voices were still intact as they entered their fifth decade of performing. Then a countrified guitar line arose during the intro to How Long and it was clear the instrumental chops were still functioning as well. The group followed that opening with two hours of hits from their vast catalog, most done in arrangements familiar to the fans. A Spanish-inflected trumpet solo led into Hotel California, but that was about as out-of-the-box as it got. Early highlights included Peaceful Easy Feeling, I Can't Tell You Why and Witchy Woman, and they closed the show with an encore of their first hit, Take It Easy.
“I want to win a national championship and become the best player I can be," Cassell said in the news release. "I saw the potential the team has this year, but they just didn’t have the depth to get over the hump. But when they get all of us in we’ll be tough.”
"Girls" represents an exciting moment in television history because, like a handful of other shows (MTV's "Awkward," most notably) it not only makes great use of the medium but has the creative guts to realign it for a new century and a new generation.

Best foreign baseball spot: Koshien Stadium, Osaka, Japan. Forget the sterile Rogers Centre in Toronto, home of the Blue Jays. The best foreign baseball park is across the Pacific in Japan. Koshien Stadium, built in 1924, is the home field of the Hanshin Tigers. How old is that? Its layout was modeled on the Polo Grounds in New York City. Ruth once played an exhibition game there. The stadium is considered hallowed ground by baseball fans in Japan, where the sport truly is the national pastime. Damaged by the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the stadium could have been torn down. Instead it has been given a seismic retrofitting that has stripped a bit of the old-time charm but kept the icon in business. The signature ivy on the exterior had to be pulled down for the repairs. It's being replanted, and in the meantime, ivy is painted on the scaffolding surrounding the stadium.
Manager Kalen Kelekoma climbs atop a wooden crate and welcomes the throng with a warm "aloha" and an explanation of the market rules. Then the horn sounds, and they rush the stalls. Some head straight for the obvious draws on this hot day — ice-cold coconuts and soursop ice cream. Others start grabbing tropical fruits they rarely get a chance to taste on the mainland — rambutans, longans, lychees and mangosteens. Some buy salad greens and broccoli.

After a warm trudge to Sacré Coeur, we returned to Lune just as Celine was leaving the shop. When she saw us, she said she was just going across the street. Instead she reopened the store. My niece tried on the electric citron dress, and it fit perfectly. Celine added a long belt made of dotted neckties in the same color, accented with three black-and-white silk flowers. Et voila!

Hamm began the stakes day with an upset in the $75,000 John W Galbreath Stakes for 2-year-old fillies. The railbirds sent Motega off as the 1-9 favorite after she'd won her four career starts, but Hamm figured his Private Cause had the edge as the youngsters tackled a longer, 1 1/16-mile test for the first time. He was right, as Motega faded in the stretch and Spieth rode Private Cause ($9.40) to win her second in four starts in 1:48.1. Hope Glitters was third.
Moreover, a vaccine against pleasure and relief, however derived, raises worrying ethical and legal issues that deserve more scrutiny than is currently being given in media coverage on the anti-addiction vaccine "breakthrough." Will vaccine therapy be implemented through legal coercion, as much of rehab is today? Will addicts take dangerously high levels of drugs in an attempt to surpass the vaccine's effect and achieve a high? (This has been observed in anti-cocaine vaccine trials, in both mice and humans.) Will children of drug users be vaccinated?
