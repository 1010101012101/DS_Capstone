My friend was right. This wine is unique. It's a complex rosé that had been aged in oak and was a combination of two red grapes, garnarcha and tempranillo, and one white, viura. It was by far the most delicious - and unusual - rosé I'd ever sipped.

Pay attention to soil preparation. Strawberries require a soil on the acidic side with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8. Because our soil tends to be alkaline, you may need to amend with soil sulfur. Also important is good drainage, as strawberries quickly rot in soggy soil. Improve in-ground drainage by amending with compost and pumice. Raised beds and containers are ideal. Use a high-quality organic potting soil.

-- A national bank regulator will replace the two agencies that oversee national banks and thrifts: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Before the crisis, the OTS offered loose oversight. For example, it let banks avoid setting aside money for future losses. The banks were allowed to assume that the riskiest mortgages would be repaid. That's why many risky lenders chose the OTS as their main regulator. The overhaul would prevent such "regulator shopping" by creating one regulator for national bank and thrifts.

I think it would be a better idea to let the draft unfold and not lock into taking specific positions in specific rounds. If all the offensive linemen with first round grades are gone when the Bears step up to the plate at No. 29, it doesn't make any sense to try to force a pick. You can't get so caught up in needs that you neglect the strengths of the draft. That's a way to end up with a mediocre team.

Approaching from Via Guido Reni, visitors see an early 20th century Italian army barracks; behind the old facade, Hadid's new building prepares for takeoff. It's shaped something like a quotation mark; its third level sweeps over the first and second before coming to a stop in a glass-lined, cantilevered gallery. This show-stopping space overlooks the plaza, which occupies an entire block and has another barracks-era building now housing a bookstore and restaurant-cafe.
What they realize now is that their mayhem has just begun.

“Ringer” isn’t quite like anything else on CW — it’s closer to the summer-filler series “The Lying Game” on ABC Family or the new nighttime soap “Revenge” on ABC — and its glimmers of humor and the quirky ways it works the specter of Bridget’s addiction into the plot make it worth keeping an eye on.

Barack Obama is singing and swinging. While the president still faces a long, hard slog to a November re-election victory, the increasingly fractious Republican nominating contest must be music to his ears.
On a sunny morning two months after Rina's death, detectives knocked at Klein's door. They had a copy of Rina's first autopsy, which said she died of lupus. Klein recalled the detectives told him they needed "to dot the i's and cross the t's." He took them to the backyard, where he said they asked if he and Rina had extramarital affairs. They did not, Klein told them.

"You saw right through me," Lawrence Kasdan says. "When Sam Shepard (as the sheriff) asks Kevin, the surgeon, 'What time they start pushin' you outta that?', he's talking about people who make movies, too. I am absolutely experiencing that firsthand. Our friends are lawyers and doctors, business people. And we all feel we're being pushed out. It's the natural cycle of things, people coming up, impatient for people who are older to get out of the way."

The neighbor I barely knew left a casserole at the front door. The milkman dropped a note at my porch saying how sorry he was and that there would be no charge for the milk.

Much of the stage banter at the Monster Ball is scripted. Perhaps this was, too, but it sure seemed sincere. Gaga showed signs of fatigue. She pushed past it to deliver a version of Monster Ball that was rougher, meaner, and ultimately more affecting than the February 19 show at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City that kicked off this leg of the endless tour. It was a show that made Lady Gaga's punk and electroclash roots apparent; one in which she expressed occasional impatience with the material and the audience; one punctuated by climactic screams and illuminated by the metallic glint of the star's steel-dagger voice.
I thought the pasta was more reasonable, ranging from $18 for spaghetti with seafood sauce up to $21 for pappardelle with Dungeness crab and squash blossoms. Then I saw the asterisk, which said: "Entree-sized pasta add $8." That made the cheapest main-course pasta $26. Gulp.

Americans, including most Americans who support improved border security, deplore the very idea of their government targeting citizens by race. Strong evidence of such a tactic by the sheriff would be invaluable at turning public sentiment against him.
"Auto loan modification is new to the public and largely unregulated, which makes it incredibly dangerous," said BBB President and CEO Sheryl Bilbrey.

Last week, in a video interview taped at Founders Den and posted on TechCrunch.com, Newsom said, "It's nice to be here ... wearing a governmental hat because a lot of these folks want to move from a space like this into their growth phase, and how do you interact with permitting?

The rule of thumb for adding structures to the landscape became the architectural equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm.

A third twister left damage in Madison, Clinton and Bond counties. The Madison County twister first hit about 9 p.m. near Bluemound Road, snapping and uprooting trees before damaging buildings on several farms, toppling a tree onto a home and causing damage to five houses in a subdivision north of St. Rose Road, the weather service said. At one point it carried metal panels from a barn building about a mile. The tornado then reached its maximum intensity of 130 mph, destroying several structures on a farm before moving into Bond County and dissipating about 9:30 p.m. seven miles south of Greenville, not far from Interstate 70. It traveled a total of 19 miles.

Pick a reason, any reason. But the late-season slump was enough to cause alarm and create doubt. The stall also cost them the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, with Vancouver overtaking St. Louis in the final weeks.

In Creekmore's family only grandson McCraw has followed in his footsteps. McCraw, 39, started clowning in 1982 at the invitation of his grandfather when he was 10, after his older cousins balked at the offer.

Now comes the Dan Maes School of Disembodied Politics, which apparently has no "edit" button. It's never smart for a candidate to insinuate, as Maes did in a profile, that his own parents weren't the sharpest knives in the drawer.

ELIZABETH — Star-Ledger reporter Gavin Dance watches as Randolph Wanderone Jr., better known as “Minnesota Fats,” cues up during a match at the Hi-Cue Billiard Lounge in Elizabeth on Feb. 10, 1971. Walderone, who was making a personal appearance at the pool hall, was immortalized in the 1961 film “The Hustler,” with Jackie Gleason filling the role of the rotund hustler opposite Paul Newman’s portrayal of Fast Eddie Felson. Wanderone was also well-remembered for a series of exhibitions played against longtime New Jersey resident Willie Moscone on ABC-TV’s Wide World of Sports in the 1970s. The Billiard Congress of America inducted Wanderone into its Hall of Fame in 1984 for “Meritorious Service” in recognition of his contributions to helping popularize the game of pool. Wanderone made fewer and fewer appearances in the 1980s, and died in Nashville in 1996, four days shy of his 83rd birthday.

While it's important to teach our children about protecting themselves, that's a heavy burden for their little shoulders to carry alone. That's why we urge every parent, guardian, and caretaker as well as every adult who works with children to educate themselves on child sexual abuse. Chaucie's Place, and other prevention organizations in Central Indiana, offer Darkness to Light's Stewards of Children child sexual abuse prevention program. The training teaches adults how to prevent child sexual abuse, recognize the warning signs and respond appropriately to a disclosure. We started conducting this training just 18 months ago and we've already trained more than 400 adults, including the after-school and early childhood staff at the Jewish Community Center; the after-school staff at Carmel Clay Parks & Recreation; swim coaches affiliated with Indiana Swimming, Inc.; and countless individuals who come to our monthly trainings in the community.

Wait a minute. How are we going to pay for our roads and bridges? They just want to add a penny to our sales tax. When we go to the store, we will pay a penny more in tax on a loaf of bread, or a pound of butter, or anything else we need, so that we can fix our roads and bridges.
Brown also said: "He improved dramatically from last year. He had a lot of added responsibility this year compared to previous years. We played through him at times.

Last season: Leslie Frazier's first full year as coach was rough. Using Donovan McNabb as stopgap for rookie quarterback Christian Ponder ended after six games. Lacking solid blocking and game-breaking receivers, Ponder mostly struggled after a couple of promising performances. Then franchise star RB Adrian Peterson tore left ACL in 15th game. Peterson is expected back for start season, but even if he's at full strength right away, Ponder needs more help. As does secondary, which was thin to begin with last year and further depleted by injuries and legal trouble for Chris Cook. Cook off hook and Antoine Winfield returns, too, but cover cornerbacks and ball-hawking safeties badly needed.

In a high-fructose-corn-syrup-infused world, soda made at a �nano-brewery� using all-natural products is a refreshing find. Since January, Sean Henry and Benjamin Topel have been marketing Soda Vie, a line of sodas in 10 unique flavors, including celery, cucumber, strawberry-lavender and Thai basil clove. The sodas intentionally contain solids, such as a sliver of chili pepper that pours out of the Citrus Kicker to show the flavors are naturally infused. And so are the bubbles. The beverage goes into the bottle still and achieves its bubbly head of foam a few days later as it ferments. Each bottle has an expiration date. The brews are sold in reusable bottles for $3 and $4.25, plus $2 bottle deposit. But so far, collectors are finding the bottles so cool that only 40 percent are returned for the deposit. Soda Vie is produced in the kitchen of Big City Hotdogs in south Kansas City. Ten percent of the profits will go to projects that help widows and orphans around the world, a particular passion of the partners.

On one hand, there is no better time for Allen to sell the Blazers. Flexibility is at an all-time high. Payroll is low. There is the chance you'd have two lottery picks in the draft. The valuation ($400-$450 million with the Rose Garden Arena included) is palatable. And you're no closer to an NBA championship than you were when you purchased the team for $70 million almost 25 years ago. The Blazers have turned into a raving migraine, and you're seemingly more interested in James Cameron's deep-sea exploration than the young players on your roster.

This will be like old times for Brown and Ngata as far as butting heads. Brown is tough and powerful, and he’ll be ready to go against his old team. Brown started his 78th consecutive game last week against the New York Giants. Ngata is the best defensive tackle in the NFL, and one of the few inside players who can dominate a game. Cody has played well in the past two games, and the two will make it a tough day for Brown. Edge: Ravens

Information hidden in Tintin's model kicks off a country-hopping adventure as Sakharine looks for the treasure and Haddock looks for another drink.
The questionable activities in high schools appear to be less systemic than the cheating that has roiled Atlanta’s elementary and middle schools, where attention focused on a single exam: the Criterion-Referenced Competency Test.

But when it comes to the guys who played outside linebacker in college, there is some quality there, but not a ton of depth. I’ll grade this class a B-minus.

For many, the home there will forever be infamous because it is where the remains of 11 women were discovered in 2009. But Sowell, the half-brother of convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell, has fond memories of the place.

With all the high emotion surrounding stocks, economist Joel Naroff cautions investors not to read too much into the recent swings. He says that stocks have a habit of running from one extreme to the other, including this spring, when he thought they were far too high. He thinks stocks may be fairly valued now.
Hospital management teams have an obligation to ensure that bills are collected in a manner consistent with the institutions' long-held values -- and that contractors like Accretive hew to these principles. Fairview executives and the hospital's board failed to live up to that responsibility.
The sheriff's office said it doesn't discriminate against Latinos and is negotiating to resolve the allegations. But Arpaio has said he's prepared to go to court if the Justice Department chooses that route.
That's the story of the mousy, mosque-going schoolteacher swept up in the window-breaking mob during the big blackout. It's the story of the milquetoast accountant who insults the quarterback's mother from the safety of the crowd. And it is the story of newspaper message boards, which have inadvertently licensed and tacitly approved the worst of human nature under the guise of free speech.
The surety of incumbency is being tested in this redrawn East Bay district, as 40-year Rep. Pete Stark, D-Fremont, is facing his stiffest challenge in years from Eric Swalwell, a 31-year-old Alameda County prosecutor and Dublin city councilman.

Leno's day job pays pretty well and keeps him busy. Yet the host of "The Tonight Show" continues to moonlight like a man whose mortgage is on the line. Most Sundays, he takes the stage at the Comedy & Magic Club (1018 Hermosa Ave.) in Hermosa Beach, testing new material in a black-box space with about 250 seats. Buy a $32 ticket to the 7 p.m. show, turn up soon after 5 p.m. (when the doors open), and you stand a good chance of claiming one of the 18 seats on the lip of the small stage. You're required to order at least two items from the menu, but some beers are less than $6. And you may get some big laughs from the two or three other comedians who typically precede Leno. Chances are he'll come out about 8 p.m. and do an hour. After all these years on television, Leno gets taken for granted. So it's strange and funny to see him pacing the stage and demonstrating such wit, memory, energy and subtlety, all the while standing about as far from you as the TV is from your couch.
He held his ground on Osi Umenyiora, refusing to trade or renegotiate with the disgruntled defensive end. Five months later, he is a healthy force rushing the passer again, stripping Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers on a crucial play in the Giants 37-20 victory last week.
A couple of Clyde's must-haves include the braised beef short ribs and the cioppino. The short ribs seemed more baked than braised, but they were delicious, their deep meaty flavor piquantly drawn out by a rich saucing with Clyde's own hoisin. As for the cioppino, it was a delectably briny melange of clams, mussels and cod in a robust stew with tomatoes and garlic. But the crab legs perched on top seemed unnecessary and, ultimately, unwanted. Save room for the creamy-citrus splendor of the house-made Key lime pie.
Many professors I've spoken with lament the fact that some students enter grad school highly focused on one area of research, but they also fear the student who jumps from project to project. From my experience, it seem that there are no true rules for picking a topic-be it a senior or masters thesis, or a Ph.D. dissertation. It's really about keeping an open mind, finding something that interests you, and seeing it through to the end.

Among the biggest concerns is Iran, the world's fourth biggest producer of crude. The U.S. and Europe may tighten sanctions against Iran over the West's fear that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb. Also, Iraq is expected to become the fastest growing producer in the Middle East in the next several years as it recovers from war and tries to tap its enormous reserves of oil. But a surge in violence there since the U.S. withdrew troops is raising concerns that Iraq won't be able to increase production as fast as hoped.

Meanwhile, China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday defended the nation's crude-oil purchases and said it opposes unilateral sanctions. At a daily news briefing, spokesman Hong Lei said China buys its crude oil "through normal channels, which is understandable, reasonable and justified. It isn't in violation of any Security Council resolutions or impaired interests of any third party or international community."
My Take: Why didn't the already cartoonish Clifford the Muppet dress up as a cat? That would have guaranteed a positive critique from me. This is a poppier and less lite-operatic take on "Memory," which is to say that nearly all of the notes have been removed from the song. In no way can I fathom this as a song choice. Webber's songs are tough, but he wrote some lilting ballads for men. Why, then, would Jason choose this massive, heart-wrenching iconic lament that was written for a powerfully voiced woman? There at least two abrupt key change that rescue Jason from having to be even vaguely musical. He keeps making his faces as if he's singing the notes, but he isn't. If you were casting a high school production of a Webber musical and a guy did this performance as an audition, you wouldn't even put him in the chorus. He sounds ridiculous, but at least some whiskers and tights could have made this high camp.

He also can use the fund to "wind down" the campaign, which means the money can pay outstanding bills and salaries. He has six months to decide how to apportion the money. He is not required to return any money to contributors. He is barred by law from using any of it for personal use.

I was always drawn to economics and enjoyed the learning and mastering the logic of economics, so I started studying economics as soon as I got to college at Lewis & Clark. But it was a junior study abroad trip to India that made it all click. I was struck by the obvious wealth difference of course, but I was even more fascinated by the questions of why some societies grow wealthy and others do not, and what could be done to improve the lives of the world's poor. This is when economics came alive to me and suddenly nothing else seemed nearly as important or

Laura Scheper, an Orange County Transportation Authority spokeswoman, addresses the issue of upcoming changes for the ramps:
State law allows cities to collect, with voters' approval, a sales tax of up to one-half of 1 percent to pay for parks and storm water improvements. In 2000, St. Peters voters approved a one-tenth of a cent sales tax for parks and storm water. The city uses that revenue to fund its annual storm water program budget of $600,000. If voters approve another sales tax increase, it would meet the city's storm water funding needs, Batzel said.

The CU program is coming off a 3-10 season in Embree's first year at the helm and all but two of the teams ranked ahead of it by Scout played in a bowl game last year. Embree said he feels good about what his coaching staff might be able to do on the recruiting trail in the future when the Buffs are more competitive and coming off bowl appearances of their own.
Charity care has caused more tension as nonprofit hospitals that provide Medicaid services for the poor argue they are not fully reimbursed for Medicaid.

In a rare contrarian opinion, BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk downgraded Apple from "Buy" to "Hold" on Monday, saying its profit margins are unsustainable.

That effect will hardly be visible when Apple reports results for the most recent quarter in two weeks, Piecyk believes, but he said it will become more apparent later this year.

On the Horizon: Just as Cleveland State has typically struggled during February, Butler seems to get its act together down the stretch. Last season, the Bulldogs rose from fifth to a tie for first in the league during February. Now a team that had just four road wins this season has picked up two last week over Youngstown State and Cleveland State. That lifted Butler to 15-12, 9-6, and into a tie for third place.

Formerly BarVino, the restaurant has an almost European feel with its modern black and red color scheme. The food seems designed for those who want to walk on the mild side. The spaghetti and meatballs, for example, taste more like tomato paste than anything else. There's also a slightly overcooked, but still delicious, veal scaloppine with Marsala porcini sauce. For appetizers, there's a bland Caesar salad and a grilled artichoke that needs the accompanying dipping sauce to give it life. And as with the other restaurants owned by the Brannan crew, you can always get fried calamari.

That's not to say there aren't reasons to fall into a funk while reading "Here on Earth," the latest work from one of the planet's great field zoologists and thinkers. Flannery doesn't bury the hard facts of climate change. But unlike those who believe the human race has evolved into a species incapable of the long-term thought and unity that can save it from overconsumption, Flannery falls in with those who still believe we can save ourselves, in part by retooling our thinking of evolution itself.

Zipping through the merest of creases, Turner broke from the left side of the key through the defense for a blow-by, left-handed layup late against UCLA two weeks ago.
The fight against climate change is a paramount issue of our time that requires vision, strategy and joint efforts. In 2006 California decided to take unilateral action on economy-wide absolute emission reductions with 2020 targets. The use of Mexican carbon offsets could be an instrument to encourage green trade. If goods imported into California are better than the domestic benchmark of carbon intensity, these net emission reductions could be converted into offsets that are fungible in California.

Early last fall, offensive coordinator David Yost said the big-armed Berkstresser was ahead of pace in terms of knowing the offense at that stage of his career.
Living within your means is something that states did quite well years ago. Lately we've been hammered with the notion that taxpayers should be like Frank above, taking less so that those below them can have more. But that hasn't been fair either. If you look back at when Maryland was operating within its income and compare it to 2010's income, you can determine the percentage of increase. Then compare the population of Maryland in the 1990's and compare it with today's population (of legal citizens). You will certainly find out that today's income increase, in percent, is much greater than the percentage increase in population. If the state could operate comfortably then it should more easily operate in 2012. The state's pockets are not bottomless.
For now the couple is permitted to operate only in the city of St. Louis. But they hope to move into other areas soon. The garden, Loomis says, will survive the higher speeds needed to get there.

Except contemporary kids are the first ones in history who aren’t overwhelmingly treated as fodder for the factory, farm or military. Some 41% of 18-to-24 year-olds are in college, which for most is essentially a four-year vacation from reality before they’re expected to do real work. The age of entrance to adult duties keeps getting pushed back. Ben Franklin was forced out of school and into the work force at 10. The beaches of Normandy were swarmed by teens and men in their early 20s. Nothing like these prospects hangs over the heads of today’s youth.

McLellan was speaking specifically about the deals last offseason that brought about defenseman Brent Burns and forward Marty Havlat, followed by the trade-deadline acquisitions of Dominic Moore, TJ Galiardi and Daniel Winnik. They were supposed to help push our beloved Los Tiburones up to the next level. Mission not accomplished.
Gradual steps toward wider freedoms, including the appointment of moderates to some government ministries, have done little to appease civil rights advocates. They predict increased hostility toward reform when the king, who is in his 80s, dies. He is expected to be replaced by his half brother Prince Nayif ibn Abdulaziz, an ally of hard-line clerics and head of the Interior Ministry and its security networks that swiftly suppress protests, arrest accused witches and anyone deviating from the harsh interpretations of the Koran.
Sure, I could tell that the often cartoonish exploits of Rip Hawk, Killer Kowalski, Cowboy Bob Ellis and the rest of the gang in the Khorassan Room were as much show biz as they were sports. And the good-natured commentary of Joe Garagiola added to the fun.
Yet Moroun's agents persist in the lie that the project would cost taxpayers $100 million a year, based on the hypothetical loss of property taxes and businesses in the Delray neighborhood where the new bridge would be built. That's probably grossly inflated, and it ignores the increased tax revenue generated by workers relocating to Detroit and neighboring communities.
In Providence, Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare initially said he would give the activists two or three days to remain in Burnside Park without a permit.

The city's safety director promised in the spring of 2009 to erase a confusing directional marker painted upon Day's center lane near Parmatown.

Let me anticipate a defense of Rudy's position  that you can be "personally pro-choice" and still object to Roe vs. Wade as judicial overreaching.

Abortion should be legalized, they maintain, but through the action of the people's elected representatives, not by the fiat of an imperial judiciary.
There’s Ron Paul, the wacky libertarian who believes in a kind of international Golden Rule: do unto other nations as you would have them do unto you.

I have been fairly open with people about how I am trying to change my eating habits, and the response has been very supportive, whether they have come from coworkers, clergy colleagues, family, friends, or parishioners. But there is a strange sense of vulnerability that comes along with this openness. I don't want people worrying about me. I don't want them worrying about what they serve, or what they eat in front of me. I also don't want people monitoring everything I eat, since so many of my meals are shared with others in my community. "Why isn't she eating the casserole? Did she just have another donut hole? Keep her away from the cookies!" Of course I know that people aren't really saying these things, or even thinking them, but I can't help but feel self-conscious sometimes.

Carlos Cardeon is one of Chile's biggest wine enthusiasts and is a major player in tourism in the valley. He opened the Hotel Santa Cruz in 2000 and painstakingly rebuilt his hotel after the 8.8 earthquake in February 2010, which leveled Santa Cruz (pop. 32,000).

He owns a 10,000-item museum next to the hotel that features a new exhibit honoring the 33 rescued Chilean miners. Miner Samuel Avalos sold $8,000 worth of his mining artifacts to Cardeon. Cardeon's Museo de Colchagua is the largest private museum in South America.

They have been sneered at by colleagues and excoriated on Internet forums. They have been welcomed to speak at a synagogue and a Jewish medical society. They were asked to write a book; that effort, "The 10,000 Year Explosion," was published early this year.
Hales: Relationships are the key. Policy helps. But policy is just paper and intention. Relationships are how things happen. I was involved in passing the bill that created an Oregon tourism division. We changed the policy from being a back office in the Department of Transportation, if you believe, to a state division that focuses on bringing people to Oregon. It was the relationships we built between the state economic development people, the tourism industry -- all these little cities and towns over the state that had hopes and dreams for what they wanted to be. That set of relationships is what keeps that effort strong. The policies there -- you can look up. But the relationships matter a lot. And in Portland, the world's biggest small town, relationships matter even more.

"In reducing twelve volumes to one, and the 14,000 to 450, the main criterion is to show Dickens' range as a letter writer. Readers who enjoy his fiction, his journalism, and his travel writing will appreciate his gifts in this fourth genre. On display here, notably in this condensed version, is the epistolary as the genre of exuberance. We see at first hand his indefatigable labors as a magazine editor, his exasperation with business arrangements (not always to his credit), his close involvement with philanthropic projects, his responses to issues of the day such as public hangings, and his alertness as a traveler. We can feel the warmth of his friendships, the richness of his social life, and, throughout, his pleasure in writing."
