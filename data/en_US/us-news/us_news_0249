Gran tells her students — most of whom were born in the 1980s — that guerrilla gardening dates from the late-1960s establishment of People's Park in Berkeley, Calif., when a disused patch of land near the University of California campus was co-opted by the community and reimagined as a public green. Today, she says, it takes place in more than 30 countries, with much of the activity documented on the British-based website guerrillagardening.org. It has spread in the United States in recent years, spurred by the "green" movement and the increased demand for locally grown, healthful food.

"The world the way Patti lives it" does at times get stretched because I am afforded opportunities to travel. I am privileged to be invited into other cities, other states and even other nations to preach and teach the Bible. This past month I went to the nation of Belize. Although I have traveled to Guatemala, Panama and Costa Rica in Central America, I had never been in Belize. Narcissism was about to get another defeat. My reality was going to change again, and my appreciation for that which is beyond my ordinary was set up to be amplified.

Many companies list calorie counts on their websites, but this does not go far enough. Few people read the nutritional information online, and a distant tidbit of information is easily forgotten when one is perusing a restaurant menu. We need the calorie content right there in front of us, weighing on our decision right up until the moment the waiter takes our order. We need that constant feedback every time we go to a restaurant, so that every time we don't make the healthy choice, we remember it and we can let that feeling guide future healthy decisions.

Whether it's Kanye West and Jay-Z's "Watch the Throne," a blockbuster album with multiple songs full of breakdowns and bass drops, or the half-time tempo of Katy Perry's "E.T.," there are dubstep elements all over the Billboard charts.

I still cry, not as openly as I used to. But I never want to stop these tears, because Erin was worth it.

When he came to St. Louis for the NCAA Midwest Regional in 1993, Williams had the team bus driver stop along the banks of the Mississippi and ordered his players to get out and spit in the river.

He is in an entirely different tax bracket now, and glad for it. But the cupidity of Hollywood has made him wary. That's why he's back, working in Chicago for the next few months. "Not every play (in Chicago) excites me to my artistic core," he said last week, "but there's a lot of stuff out there that's like, 'Yeah, I would love to be in that play.' In LA, the scripts are like — just the titles alone are so depressing, like 'Dumb Girls.' So there is that question of, why do I want to be an actor? To be in movies and TV just for the sake of making money and it's a good job?"

- Adams said this is a permanent assignment, meaning he's not going to pawn the police off on another city commissioner anytime soon. In that regard, today marks a new beginning for his administration. He's finally taken personal responsibility for one of the city's most basic services -- the men and women who keep us safe and carry guns on our behalf -- and the sheer amount of work that entails will reshape his agenda over the next two years of his term. It will be interesting to see whether he follows this major decision with any changes within his own office. Let me be blunt on this one: He needs stronger staff to help him set priorities, follow through on his promises and, most importantly, respond to crisis.

This is just another giveaway to the casino industry. The result will be more damage to people who will borrow money from casinos that they cannot afford to lose, and then promptly lose it.
And so, you have narrowed your definition. I am trying to get you to widen it. You've decided to have a definition of transparency to work for a story line you've decided before the story started. I have actually stood in front of the City Council and announced what I was doing. I have stood and worked the legislative body to pass a piece of legislation and I understand the politics of it and what went into it and went public with it.

The GOP is already catching grief from its right wing over taxes, the Democrats from the left over the size of the spending reductions. In the real world, this would be considered a good thing, a sign that both parties are making difficult decisions. The next step? Split the differences down the middle and end up with a $1.6 billion package that is 65 percent based on spending cuts and 35 percent on tax increases — or at least something in that neighborhood.

One drawback is that he is invaluable as chairman of the Budget Committee and in 2015 might become chairman of Ways and Means.

Coffee shakes, like the ever popular Black Tiger and Velvet Hammer, include generous amounts of caffeine in some form -- either drip coffee, espresso and/or coffee grounds, the grittiness of which is an acquired taste.

Before we proceed, a word is in order about prices. These cottages, like so many properties that open these days, are aimed at the deep-pocket traveler who doesn't blanch at spending $500 or more for 19 hours' use of a room. And while the prices in the restaurant were in line with establishments of that quality, the cottage rates seemed a little, well, ambitious.

So I put my glove up and, if you look at the photo, you can see that I have perfect form. I mean, for the kids out there, please use it as an example.

"This is the only lyric I've written that consists of one long incomplete sentence," Sondheim says. "I wanted it to be like the descriptive caption you might read in a museum next to the painting.

Unfortunately, thanks to the notion that the government is entitled to regulate whatever it subsidizes, politicians feel entitled to rule anyone who depends on a market that they mangle.

For the most part artists are allowed a freedom of expression that many others in Cuban society would relish.

Rhodes, a fashion designer by trade, originally created these sets and costumes for MOT and San Diego Opera back in 2004. They are fabulously ostentatious (or is it ostentatiously fabulous?). From the sun-drenched tropical colors and stylized palm trees to the aqua bikini bottoms on the female dancers and the white loincloths on the men, the opera plays out like a hallucinatory fantasy in a far-off Ceylon fishing village that looks a lot like South Beach.

Could other sports inspire poetic flights of fancy? It's doubtful. Football poetry would employ too many single-syllable words. In basketball poetry, the final two lines of the piece would have too much importance. Hockey bards would have a devil of a time rhyming words like "concussion" and "Niklas Hjalmarsson." And forget about soccer: Even in poetry, something needs to happen.

On top of that, despite more-than-excellent constitutional arguments against Obamacare, which effectively would bring a sixth of the nation's economy under government control, it is pretty much a toss-up which way the Supreme Court will rule in June.

When it comes to the gift-giving part of the season, as KATU recently reported, "The basic idea is to give someone a gift only you can give them." You could give a loved one a book highlighting memories of times together or coupons offering your baking or driving services. The money saved by not giving people sweaters that they end up returning can go to things such as clean water programs in developing countries or area shelters. That is what Imago and other area churches are doing with the money they collect. If families adopt a version of this, they could avoid a lot of those gift cards entirely.

The presence of Andy McDonald, Alex Steen and David Perron is the Blues' X factor for their upcoming playoff series against the Los Angeles Kings. As you know, the Blues lost the regular-season series to the Kings and managed to scrimp for only three goals in four games. That won't do in the playoffs. But I don't know if we can attach too much value to the skimpy goal total considering that the Blues usually went against the Kings without their best scorers.

Needs: Players, besides the trio of James, Wade and Bosh. Beasley has star potential, but has thus far been a study in inconsistency. He might be traded to allow maximum contracts for the star trio. Also under contract is so-so point guard Mario Chalmers. As of now, the Heat must fill the roster with seven minimum-salary contracts. There is some speculation that James, Wade and Bosh might surrender some dollars so Miami can offer a reasonable contract to a talented veteran such as guard-forward Mike Miller. James and Wade will have to work out some things. Who is the guy to take the big shot at the end of the game? Star duos have made it work before, but these are two especially strong personalities, so it will be intriguing to watch – although maddening for Cavaliers fans. Throw in the ego of team president Pat Riley — who could unceremoniously dispatch Spoelstra as he once did Stan Van Gundy when a title run seemed possible — and there are certain dynamics which could create problems.

Matt Vensel, blogger/reporter: I'm hesitant to give a grade based on evaluations on these players because 1) I'd be lying to you if I told you that I watched one second of Asa Jackson's or Gino Gradkowski's game tape, and 2) I haven't gotten a chance to get to know any of these guys yet and get a feel for what makes them tick. But I do feel comfortable giving a grade based on how they tried to address needs. The offensive line was the big one, and in Osemele and Gino Gradkowski, they got two athletic, versatile linemen who should fit into their zone scheme. I loved the Courtney Upshaw pick. He will likely be the bookend edge rusher that will make things a little easier for Terrell Suggs. Streeter has a ton of natural athleticism, and if the coaching staff does its thing, he may end up being a steal. And most of these players bring something to the table on special teams, an area that John Harbaugh really wants to get in gear. Check back for my official grade in three years, but based on their draft-weekend maneuvering, I give them a solid B. I'm eager to see how some of these little-known prospects pan out, but team officials acknowledged they had missed out on other players they coveted. Down the road, we can judge how well they did reacting on the fly. Grade: B.

The first receiver gave large raises to most workers under his control, arguing that the state could not attract qualified individuals otherwise.

Hirsch has made an important film. It would have been strengthened, however, with a larger overview of the problem, a look at the bullies and solution strategies. It's easy to blame feckless administrators, and the film does, but there are so many other tentacles. Perhaps a "Bully 2" could address more of those.

I asked Jeff Fisher today if the free-agent miss (on wide receivers) means the Rams are more inclined to grab Oklahoma State wide receiver Justin Blackmon. Fisher said the Rams have been doing their work on Blackmon, and called Blackmon an impressive prospect. But Fisher downplayed the Rams' interest, which is understandable. No one knows if Blackmon will fall to the Rams' spot at No. 6 overall. And if the Rams are inclined to trade up to get Blackmon, it would be silly for Fisher to drive up the price in advance by raving about Blackmon in media interviews.
