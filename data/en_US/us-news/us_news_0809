Now, right there, I think, I finally get into words my main squawk against this section: the piddling occupations to which the people dedicate their lives. Bear in mind my disclaimer of high-brow leanings, which is honest, and the earthy nature of the intellectual fodder that I ask. I am greatly stimulated by a trapper boy in a West Virginia coal-mine, or a puddler in a Pennsylvania steel-mill, or a hand on a Nebraska corn-farm. These people, although they usually talk a dreadful jargon, are frequently morons, and sometimes anything but admirable personally, all take part in vast human dramas, and I find it impossible to disregard the stature which their occupations confer on them. If they are prosperous, it is big news; if they are hungry, it is tragic; and no matter what their condition is, they share some of the electric importance of the stages they tread

Michigan got a taste this spring of what it means to endure erratic weather -- one of the potential scenarios for global warming -- with a freakish warm spell in March during which most of the state's fruit crops started budding.

In November, an earlier version of the business plan estimated that it would cost more than $98 billion to build a 520-mile line of dedicated, electrified tracks that would be used only by high-speed trains from downtown San Francisco to downtown Los Angeles and on to Anaheim. The plan approved Thursday lops about $30 billion off that price tag. At $68.4 billion, the new version realizes most of its savings by calling for a "blended system" in which high-speed trains would share tracks or right-of-way now used by commuter trains in the Bay Area and Los Angeles Basin.

MF: I don't see how we can maintain a decent society if we have a world split into haves and have-nots, with the haves subsidizing the have-nots. In our current educational system, close to 30 percent of the youngsters who start high school never finish. They are condemned to low-income jobs. They are condemned to a situation in which they are going to be at the bottom. That leads in turn to a divisive society; it leads to a stratified society rather than one of general cooperation and general understanding. The effective literacy rate in the United States today is almost surely less than it was 100 years ago. Before government had any involvement in education, the majority of youngsters were schooled, literate and able to learn. It is a disgrace that in a country like the United States, 30 percent of youngsters never graduate from high school. And I haven't even mentioned those who drop out in elementary school. It's a disgrace that there are so many people who can't read and write. It's hard for me to see how we can continue to maintain a decent and free society if a large subsection of that society is condemned to poverty and to handouts.

The ocean is the one image that recurs consistently in my dreams, usually in the form of tidal waves, and often with enormous fish and whales as major players in the dream.

How come I'm not throwing myself in and being swept along in its currents?

When the perpetrator is the charmless Chris Pratt (Parks and Recreation) or Brian Posehn (The Sarah Silverman Program) it's noxious; when it's Blunt and the scene-stealing Alison Brie (Community, Mad Men) complaining about their partners in Muppet voices, it's a gas.
Their mission was to make contact with village leaders around the area to find out if they needed supplies like medicine and whether they had any information about the enemy. The soldiers know that this area is filled with battle-hardened insurgents.

There's another precedent for Shurmur and Childress when it comes to mentoring. In 1999, the Eagles brought in former Green Bay backup Doug Pederson, then 31, to help McNabb. That was back when rookie quarterbacks actually had a chance to watch and learn for a few games. Pederson, who served the same role in Cleveland for Tim Couch a year later, started the first nine games before McNabb took over.

The bullpen is leaking. The hitters struggle. But the starters are tighter with runs than a miser's wallet. The Indians are wasting good starting pitching the way last year's team wasted a fast start.
Former Fed governor Lawrence Lindsey put this in perspective in a recent Weekly Standard article. Even assuming some moderate cuts in spending over the next few years, if interest rates return to "normal" -- they're unusually low now -- the annual cost of servicing the U.S. debt would skyrocket from about $200 billion this year to more than $800 billion in 2015 and $1.15 trillion in 2019.
"This is my worst nightmare," Toder told Chief U.S. District Judge Michael Davis in a hearing without the jury present. He argued that her testimony would inflame jurors and complained that federal prosecutors would imply drug and alcohol use was rampant.

Potenza is a Midwesterner by background, a surgeon by profession. He worked around the clock treating burn victims last October, stopping only to evacuate his own house, which was under threat from a second fire. He speaks carefully, knowing that illegal immigration is a politically charged issue. An estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States, and their health emergencies pose a burden to hospitals. He knows many people were enraged that the victims were treated rather than deported. "Their injuries give them something of a pass," he said. "But it's a huge price to pay."
I don't know what was worse, the inconvenience of driving to their warehouse or the fear of having to program the remote myself.

"The only thing that will keep the Marlins from doing well is if they don't win. I think it will come down to the success of the team," he said. "I think the experience is going to be a lot of fun.

We certainly owe a debt to those who have borne the battle on our nation's behalf. In these wars of choice we have required them to do so over and over. They and their families are tired. They are, in general, neither heroes nor villains. They volunteered (albeit with insufficient information) to be where they are and do what they do. Like the Roman Legionnaires of old they have chosen to fight their country's foreign wars. Whether they made the right decision, only they can say. We at home who have come to largely ignore these conflicts as they dragged on into pointlessness, and we cannot fully comprehend the costs to the young people who have been there. They deserve our support and especially the best treatment we can provide for those who will carry the emotional and physical scars of their participation into the rest of their lives.

Gwinnett County, which roundly defeated a chance to join MARTA in 1990, is a good example of how hard it will be to balance the wishes of commuters. The population has more than doubled since then, which means those MARTA naysayers have been joined by a flood of new residents, many used to riding rail transit in other cities.

“Generally, what we've seen over the past couple years, the statewide school trend is that with all of the reductions in state funding – delayed payments and reductions – it's caused the majority of Kansas school districts to dip into their cash position,” she said. “Some have been able to manage that better than others. Unfortunately, in the case of Gardner-Edgerton, they've not had that flexibility.”
The link between gambling and trading isn't just a personal one, said Steven Weisman, a professor who teaches entertainment and gambling law at Bentley University in Boston. Recent Internet gambling laws have excluded day trading which, he said, "is as much of a gamble as any throw of the dice or bet on a horse."
The Giants (11-7) were the trendy pick because they were the hot team and have been doing all of the things that win games this time of year, like getting after the quarterback, running the ball well, playing solid downfield coverage, winning the turnover battle and riding Eli Manning’s hot hand.

But anyway, there are other things going on today, too ... like basketball practice. The Ducks are set to hit the road today for Utah, where they will match up with probably the least-talented team in the conference. The Utes don't have much going for them and the Ducks have been good on the road but if there's one thing the weak Pac-12 has taught us this year, it's that anyone can win (except USC, most days). We will have more on the blog later about the basketball team's matchup with Utah but know this: The Ducks cannot turn the ball over 23 times, even against a bad team, and expect to win. It doesn't work like that and Dana Altman knows it. I still believe Oregon can put together and run and win the Pac-12 tournament. But they've got to tighten up a few problems first.

Second, we've estimated that most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system - a system that is currently full of waste and abuse.

Seeking to make sense of the senseless, many people began blaming the current "culture of hate," naming Glenn Beck, Sarah Palin and others on the right who, they charged, lay down an unrelenting barrage of rhetoric and provocative metaphors that combine to make violence a logical next step. As it quickly became clear that Loughner didn't fit a neat political profile, some on the right responded with their own lists of adversaries whose demeanor adds to the general mood of churlishness. Others blamed lax gun laws for the mayhem, and still others blamed the violence on television, movies and video games.

As the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Durbin surely has much larger concerns than opposing the late closing times of a small city's bars on the belief that they incubate violent crime. But as an East St. Louis native with a soft spot for his hometown - and a college degree partly funded by summers working in a National City meatpacking house - Durbin spouts what I'm certain from past conversations about our roots is sincere concern.

6. Some states are moving from paternalism to partnership with their regions. Historically, governors and legislatures have more often preferred to micromanage local governance rather than recognize that metros are their true "cash cows," the chief contributors to state coffers.

But the last year has shown that the military has no affinity for being the public face of power. The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has clumsily, and at times violently, presided over the nation whose aspirations for wider civil rights ran counterintuitive to the military's inherent rigidness. As the ruling generals prepare to return to the barracks, however, they are laying down markers.

The good? The porterhouse for two is a beautiful piece of dry-aged beef. It arrives sizzling in butter, charred on the outside, medium rare at the center, already cut off the bone. The plate is glazed with meat drippings and so hot it gives off palpable heat waves. As the waiter plates it out, he calls out the cuts — fillet, New York strip. And yes, he does leave the bone. Lamb chops are thick and flavorful, and the hefty veal chop, charred on the outside, is more appealing than most.

Joe Freeman, The Oregonian: I separate players into two categories: Someone I want on my team and someone I want on the other team. If I were a captain in a pickup game, I would pick Wesley Matthews and his fiery demeanor, win-above-all-else attitude and exceptional work ethic to be on my team. Now is he a starter on my team? That depends. The Blazers' front office will look hard at landing an All-Star-caliber point guard to take pressure off of All-Star forward LaMarcus Aldridge. The Blazers' preference is to land a point guard who can space the floor, create his own shot and draw double teams. That type of player accentuates Matthews' strengths (long-range shooting, defense) and masks his weaknesses (ball-handling, penetrating). So if the Blazers find this kind of point guard, Matthews remains their starter. If not, all bets are off. Either way, there is little doubt about this: The Blazers view Matthews as a long-term piece of the franchise, no matter what his role is.

Health issues often come wrapped up with fear about the outcomes. Even if the condition isn't life-threatening, it can result in anxiety-inducing changes.

So, to start out, notice how you're feeling. Sit quietly, taking some deep breaths, and acknowledge your emotions. Accept that you're going to have a wide range of responses to the challenges you face, and recognize them without judging yourself.

Host cities are selected six years before the event, following a two-year application process. Guadalajara was awarded the 2012 games in May 2006, before drug-related violence became the hot-button issue in Mexico.

Organizers are working with transportation officials to improve public transportation and roadways; area schools will close during the games to ease traffic jams.

The dish showed Belotti's skills. Unlike American-bred chefs, he barely moistens his pasta with the sauce; it glistens on the pasta but barely pools in the bottom of the bowl.

"Real Housewives of New Jersey" should have come with a warning sticker this week: Kim Granatell will give you whiplash. First she tells Jacqueline Laurita that Teresa Giudice was out of control at the North Jersey Country Club throwdown, then she commiserates with Teresa about Danielle Staub bringing up Teresa's financial problems -- as if Teresa would ever admit to having something as crass as financial problems. And then she's by Danielle's side when Danielle presses charges against Jacqueline's daughter, Ashley Holmes. And THEN she shows up at Jacqueline's house with the freaking newspaper and tells Jacqueline that she'll stand by her side if she needs her ... but she probably won't have to because, Kim G. says, "by that time, we probably won't be friends anymore." It's a little unclear about whether she's talking about Jacqueline or Danielle. But she's probably right in either case.
