There aren’t many position groupings in the NFL Draft that are judged by their versatility like defensive linemen. You have defensive ends that can project to 3-4 outside linebackers, and defensive tackles who need to be able to play with a hand in the dirt, then bounce across the line, depending on the scheme.

But in a broader sense, Entner calls Intel "the glue that holds it all together," and cautions against counting it out.
"The Girl Who Played With Fire," which was directed by Daniel Alfredson from a screenplay by Jonas Frykberg, doesn't have the nuances of its predecessor. It's more of a straight-ahead action saga, although straight ahead is a better description of the hurtling pace than the convoluted plot, which takes all sorts of twists and turns in the present while delving further into the tortured past of its heroine, Lisbeth Salander. If you're resistant to extravagant melodrama, or flat-out horror tropes, you may find the film inferior to "Dragon Tattoo." For my own part, I confess to enjoying the lurid stuff just as much as the dramatic intricacies that reflect the texture of the source. (At least some of the texture; what's decreasingly present in the screen adaptations is Mr. Larsson's moral outrage at what he saw as modern society's pervasive corruption.)

A: It's a message to the series' referees. But it also is a subtle one to Shane Battier and Udonis Haslem about thinking first before stepping in. Yet when properly taking a charge, it means defending with their feet, which, I assume, is something Vogel also wants to see from his players. Can't wait until Erik Spoelstra gets into Roy Hibbert's rock step being a travel.

Hey, Tony: I'm not suggesting nor stoking a QB debate. What shortcomings does Seneca Wallace have that preclude him from being a starter?

The script: Why did OSU’s offensive line get criticized virtually all season? Because the Beavers ran for just 24 net yards against Wisconsin, 47 yards against Arizona State, 59 yards against BYU, 32 yards against Utah, 33 against Stanford, 21 against California and 21 against Oregon. Those were all losses, and proof that dramatic improvement in run-blocking needs to be made in 2012. … OSU coach Mike Riley says Seumalo could conceivably start at tackle, guard, or center and that Hasiak could be plugged in at guard or tackle. “And who knows (who else) is going to surface besides Isaac and Hasiak,’’ said Riley. “We want to look at our talent, see how we come out of the spring, then we’re going to place (Seumalo) in the best place for him and our team.’’ … Riley talks about other promising youngsters on the line - he mentioned Addie and redshirt freshman Jake Welch - and says he’s excited by the thought of a healthy Philipp resurrecting his career after two injury-plagued seasons.

Even the dozen original songs on the group's latest album, "Paradise Hop," sound like they could've been written by coal miners or hobos in the 1920s. Never mind their modern references to collapsing interstate bridges and the like. Even their wild version of "I Am the Walrus" from 2010's "Minnesota Beatle Project, Vol. 2" album -- which became a calling card of sorts locally -- sounded like an old-timey barn-dance number.

Focusing on the antiwar dissenters, the prescient ones who sensed the great tragedy at hand, Hochschild brings us the famous, such as mathematician, philosopher and patrician Bertrand Russell, and little-known conscientious objectors such as Fenner Brockway. The Pankhurstfamily that represented the women's suffrage movement in Britain, was ripped apart by the war. Sylvia Pankhurst, as of 1914 as much a socialist as a feminist, resolved to "speak more urgently for peace." Her mother, Emmeline, and sister Cristabel became zealous patriots, supporting crown and country and going from being force-fed in prison before the war to government-sponsored pro-war speaking tours. Through the gripping personal stories of socialists, Labour Party dissenters, conscientious objectors, dissident suffragettes and their often lonely and dangerous work of protest, underground newspapers and long prison sentences, Hochschild resurrects some of history's forgotten heroes.

The Bulls' 92-87 win over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse was less significant than Rose taking a major step forward in the second-to-last regular-season game. Don't let his ugly stat line fool you. Rose was 3-for-11 from the field. He finished with 10 points and seven assists in 26 minutes. But he proved that while he might not have recovered fully from five injuries that have caused him to miss 26 games this season, he's getting his bounce back, which is the best possible news for the Bulls.

Earlier in the evening, programming veep Andy Cohen asks the question we've all wondered about: Why would Danielle go on a show like this knowing she had a past like that? Danielle seems to think it would have stayed hidden if the Manzos hadn't found out about it. Dina that they heard about the book from her niece, who had been told about it by one of Danielle's friends. "I disliked you prior to the book," Caroline says. "When I found the book, I disliked you ever more, and I lost any kind of faith or trust, anything I had in you." How could Danielle fault her for investigating this, Caroline asks.

I heard that radio ad after returning from Austin, Texas, where the locals talk about the sea of Californians moving to their pro-growth (but attractive, friendly and hip) locale. California officials remain in denial. They promote bills that shift more money from the private economy to the state, which promptly squanders it as quickly as possible.

As evidenced by the June 19 match between the Portland Timbers and the New York Red Bulls at Jeld-Wen Field, soccer can be a cruel game indeed.

"The variable-speed, in my opinion, is the way to go," says O'Grady. "They're quieter and have a lot of great attributes. Mostly, there's incredible savings for homeowners. After the first three years, you're going to save a considerable amount of money. Some of my customers are only paying $100 per year, and some as low as $55. That's an incredible savings."

Pounded into poi, it's a calcium-rich staple of the traditional Hawaiian diet, the purplish paste tourists edge warily past at the luau buffet.

These two franchises have met three times in the postseason, last year's matchup, which Dallas won in five games, as well as in 1984 and '87 when the Thunder were known as the Seattle SuperSonics. Dallas won in '84 while Seattle rebounded in '87.
It's a trick question. A tomato is actually a fruit. But let's leave aside the horticultural definition and talk about how Congress failed the quiz. It chose 2 tablespoons, blocking sorely needed nutritional upgrades to the $11 billion federal school lunch programs. It did so because members' brains (and quite possibly their bellies) are controlled by lobbyists.
In Lincoln County, the Troy school district is seeking a 75-cent property tax increase to maintain and improve facilities. District officials say Hawk Point Elementary School would be shut down and other cuts made if the measure isn't passed.

So what do they do? For the most part, we keep hearing idiotic questions. We have Rep. Michele Bachman complaining about government while she takes government money for the mortgage on her house, her husband takes it for his company, and she thinks Glenn Beck can solve our debt problem. Sarah Palin has no idea about much of anything, but she has found that she can quit an elected job and ride around in a bus saying nothing but still making money. Then there is Donald Trump, who has already filed for bankruptcy four times but says he will run if the economy stays bad.

� If it's been less than a month: Don't go overboard! (No Journey pendants, please.) But don't just get a card - think how awkward it will be to stand there watching her read it. Try to keep it in the $25 range, and pick something "small, but significant to the conversation that you've been having with this person," Casey says. Think: a book by an author he mentioned, a candle with one of her favorite scents.

-- Chip Kelly really does care for his players. I've never doubted that. Often, I think he cares to a fault. But it was very cool to see him genuinely emotional while in the corner of Kiko Alonso.

In straight lines and freeway cruising, the transmission shifts are subtle and smooth, while acceleration is uniform and measured. The engine emits into the cabin a soft purr by way of something called an "intake sound generator." When I was a kid, the engines made the sound, but with layers of sound dampening to keep out road and wind noise (which this GS does quite well), this is what we're reduced to.
Law school students helped review and edit the recordings.
One school of thought holds that multiples of all kinds should be lower now because the U.S. has entered a period of slow economic growth and lower profits as governments and households pay off their enormous debts.

It is actually a form of pride -- in a politician or anyone else -- to believe that every thought produced by the firing of one's neurons is immediately fit for public consumption.

(Quick aside: If history is a guide, this is where critics will attack the source of that coverage. People's World calls itself "the direct descendant of the Daily Worker," and acknowledges its partisan stance on "oppressed peoples," Marxism and socialism.

Bonus: A flight of special wines -- usually four examples of one varietal. Last week's was California Pinot Noir, four single-vineyard wines from Sonoma, Santa Barbara and Russian River Valley. These can seem expensive -- the Whitethorn Winery Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir was $9.25 for a taste, $18.50 for a glass -- but this is one of the few places you can taste this wine, which is made in limited quantities and goes to high-end restaurants that sell it by the bottle. The flight costs $31 for four tastes; $62 for four glasses.

My column this week looked at City Councilman Eric Garcetti and posed a question that I hear a lot: Is he tough enough to be mayor? He argued that he is, and I laid out both the question and his answer.

It's this last group of anti-Romney holdouts I'd like to address. First, let me say: I feel your pain. The tea party arose in no small part out of a delayed allergic reaction to the rhetorical and, to a lesser extent, policy problems of George W. Bush's presidency and the deep resentment that came with having to vote for John McCain in 2008. These disappointments were visited upon the conservative base by something the naysayers (often problematically) call "the Republican establishment."

The first half ended with Akron leading, 29-28, and with Marshall still on the floor. In the early minutes, the junior center lost his composure and flipped an elbow at the head of Ohio's John Smith. But unlike the quarterfinals, when Western Michigan's Matt Stainbrook was ejected for a flagrant elbow against Kent State, a monitor review by the officials showed the elbow did not make contact, so Marshall was not ejected, or given a technical foul.

Dead Dogs was born about a year ago, when La Barbera, a car collector and shopping center developer, looked up cars for sale on the Internet and noticed a Cadillac hearse for sale.

He served as a mentor to both Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell and helped found the National Association of Evangelicals. As Rice's oldest grandson, Himes grew up in the heart of fundamentalism, planning to be a preacher like his father and grandfather before him. By the time he graduated from high school, however, he'd thoroughly rejected his upbringing and embraced Marxism (another fundamentalism he's since left behind). In The Sword of the Lord Himes works back through his family's history to seek out the forces that shaped fundamentalism, but never loses sight of the human beings at the center of the movement.

The sous vide chicken ($29) also takes on a meaty essence; it's cut into perfect crisp-skinned rectangles and served with caramelized onions, cauliflower and carrots.

Aruba's system became familiar to many Americans who followed the disappearance in 2005 of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway. Authorities repeatedly detained individuals suspected of involvement but then later had to release them for lack of evidence. That case was never solved.
Marine Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has expressed concern about the impact that those incidents have had on the war, according to a senior defense official.

Golden-crowned kinglets flitted in the treetops, and brown creepers crept up the bark, producing a high-pitched cacophony of song. Woodpeckers – Northern flicker, red-bellied, hairy and downy – were noisy and active, although the normally reliable red-headed woodpeckers were nowhere to be found, which was troublesome.

In the NHL playoffs, teams are re-seeded after each round. The Blues are the No. 2 seed and would become the top seed if Vancouver loses to L.A. The Kings would remain the lowest seed in the West, so they would be the automatic opponent for the Blues regardless of what happens in the other series. Game 5 of the Vancouver-L.A. series is tonight (7 p.m. St. Louis time), so with a win by the Kings, the Blues would know their second-round opponent.
It would have taken some unconscious shooting by Martin, Sage Indendi, and Ali Gibson to throw another scare into Stanford.

Eventually Giovanni took the caper too far in the eyes of the SS. A friend offered him safe passage into Switzerland, but as the story goes, he took the opportunity to save his young Jewish fiancé instead.
A far more controversial claim is that Republican administrations, not to mention conservative hawks, prefer legal, multilateral and diplomatic solutions to problems, too. But it also happens to be true. George W. Bush spent a lot of time at the U.N. before we invaded Iraq. He never resorted to military action against Iran or North Korea, despite the utter futility of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions. Sure, the right is probably more eager to use force, but it's also more eager to seem like it will.

"It's a real community here," says Leigh Okies of Crimson Horticultural Rarities, strolling by with jewelry designer Marisa Haskell. "People have studios in their stores." Her own rustic jewel box of a shop mixes sculptural succulents, terrariums and taxidermy with a Paxton Gate-like verve. Ordinary Joes and long-tressed rockers loiter outside the barber shop to take their turn in the chair, and Lot 49 owner Perry Lucina chats with passers-by while lounging outside his home design space.

There is some question as to whether Lucas -- who didn't return phone calls -- can afford to properly dispose of the sewage oozing out of those earthen berms, a clean-up operation that may cost upwards of 50 cents per gallon. According to the DOJ's court filings, Lehman Hot Springs LLC was garnished $72,000 by the IRS in 2008.
Rarely was a man so uninterested in being loved so adored. His books sold millions of copies and his most curmudgeonly persona became as much a part of his legend as "Where the Wild Things Are," his signature book, and a hit movie in 2009. Communities attempted to ban his work, but he also had friends in the most powerful places. President Bill Clinton awarded Sendak a National Medal of the Arts in 1996 and in 2009 President Obama read "Where the Wild Things Are" for the Easter Egg Roll.

My Take: Sorry, but I'm a little distracted. I was just home for the start of Passover and Carly appears to be wearing the upholstery from my parents' couch. OK. Distraction over. Thank you, Carly, for being tonight's first contestant to sing a version of the song that approximated the difficulty and range of the original. Note that I said "approximated" and not "equaled," because that would just be silly. I'm not sure if Carly exactly has the lyrics down, but this is the best workout she's given her pipes in many a week and she's the first singer since Syesha to have any fun with this theme at all. Yeah, she's shouty, but I've always thought that "Jesus Christ Superstar" was a bit of a shouty song.

Barry Abrams, a racehorse trainer in Southern California for three decades, said he is deeply troubled by every death but that it is unrealistic to think that fatalities can be eliminated. Certain types of fractures are extremely difficult to treat because horses cannot lie down for long periods without risking respiratory illness and other health problems. Euthanizing them is considered the most humane option.
Earl Bennett was injured and didn't play in the game at Lambeau Field. Fill-in Rashied Davis was the Bears' most effective receiver with seven catches for 63 yards. Expect Bennett - or perhaps even Davis in a limited role - to be high on the lists of Cutler's targets Sunday.
"He got spit on when the students stormed the court. A student ran by him and spit on him. Nothing too major," Matta said. "What are you going to do? Those things happen. It was a crazy environment, which was great for college basketball, for their fans and that sort of stuff. You don't want stuff like that to happen, but you can't do anything about it."

One of Northeast Ohio's oldest Mexican restaurants, Marcelita's, has been a favorite in the Hudson area since 1978. Opened by Mexico City native Marcela Arregui de McNeill, it was a family-run establishment until 2008 when longtime fans Kevin and Beth Killeen purchased the restaurant. They made a few additions, such as more bar-food specials and live music on weekends, but didn't mess with Marcelita's menu.

A June report issued by the American Association of Medical Colleges says no. In a model that accounts for the influx of newly insured patients, increasing utilization of doctor visits, decreases in physician working hours, modest growth of the resident work force and greater use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, a 130,600-physician shortage is anticipated by 2025, half of which will be primary-care doctors.

TRUSCOTT: We need to wise up and not allow your Democrat friends to vote in our open primary. They've admitted they want to run against Santorum and will be voting for him on Tuesday.

"When he moves his feet, he's a better player," Babcock said. "Being a big-time player at this time of year is real simple. Lots of guys have regular-season success and can't have any in the playoffs just because they're not gritty enough and determined enough. They need more space. Well, there's no space. You gotta make your own space. You gotta dig in and find a way to do that.
None of them, in other words, is content with his life, and each believes a Big Year will scratch whatever itch is plaguing him. But, as Kenny's string of broken marriages attests, a Big Year is a total commitment; you have to be ready to jet off at any time to where the birds are. This isn't as big a financial difficulty for Stu or Kenny, a successful contractor. For Brad, however, it's a trickier proposition.

I think documentary filmmakers like Errol Morris, the Pennabakers, whoever, who get tapped for 30-second commercial making, feature films, whatever, you can't judge them for modifying their craft to do different outputs. They need to modify their product to make a ton of money  they do it! They have a personal project they've been working on for 20 years, they do that one. One empowers the other, and I think the economy of reality in television is empowering all kinds of media output, including the best scripted television that reality is sort of underwriting in a way.
It's not just that the Blazers are tossing alley-oops to each other on two-on-one fast breaks or when a player runs the baseline unabated to the basket in the half court. The playbook features an alley-oop option in multiple sets, typically through a "spin lob" or a "pick-and-roll lob."
Designer fast fashion fizzle? Sure, fast fashion designer collaborations make news. But do they still make sales? Despite the buying frenzies of 2011, there were also plenty of returns in stores and items put up for sale on EBay from last year's Missoni for Target and Versace for H&M collections. And the Giambattista Valli for Macy's merchandise didn't seem to move much at all. The next big designer collaboration is Marni at H&M, debuting on March 8. Marni designer Consuelo Castiglioni has a knack for color and print, but her designs are quite avant garde, which could make this collection H&M's most esoteric yet — after Comme des Garcons, that is. Sofia Coppola directed the ad campaign. We'll see who lines up for the launch.

Director Emmanuel Deleage finds some poetry in his English translation, and his staging has some smart notions, such as the onstage band made up of riot cops, or the every-period moves (choreographed by Lindsey Stakoe) in the dance marathon that ultimately proves critical. His 31-member cast is variable in polish but uniformly invested. Patrick Riviere’s suave boss, Oscar T. Basulto’s frenetic opposite number, Lena-Marie’s dulcet-voiced neighborhood caregiver, and Verona Masongsong and Claudia Durán as August’s very different amours are among the standouts.

Making health care more accessible and affordable are clearly shared goals that everyone can agree with. But reaching a consensus that the majority of the American people can support is equally vital. President Obama’s health care law has already been struck down by the court of public opinion.

It inserts Washington bureaucrats in-between doctors and patients. And it grants the federal government unprecedented and unconstitutional powers over the American people. It is time for the Supreme Court to strike down the president’s health care law.

It was hard for me to come to terms with the fact that my diet will always have to be quite limited, but I am now beginning to enjoy my newfound health, and I'm creatively coming up with new ways to eat well. My issue is with my family. I don't visit them very often, as I am a student in a different city, but when I do, they never seem to get that I just can't eat certain types of food. Without fail, I am served something I can't eat, or they make it and eat it in front of me, raving about how good it is and it's too bad I can't have any, poor me. Even my grandmother does this. It makes me feel that my family is incredibly insensitive, and frankly, I'm getting tired of it. I don't want to act like a victim, so I just smile and carry on. Is there a tongue-in-cheek way to let them know I have had enough before I lash out at one of them? — My Way

The New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for road and bridge repairs and transit services, will be bankrupt by spring. Ever since Gov. Chris Christie killed the Hudson River train tunnel, speculation has been that he would use part of New Jersey’s $2.7 billion tunnel commitment to salvage the transportation fund. Christie has opposed raising the state’s relatively low gas tax to pay for transportation projects, prompting transportation expert Martin E. Robins to predict that any trust fund measure taken this year would be "very much of a Band-Aid."

After that game, Cutler acknowledged that the Bears used the same basic game plan they used against the Packers on Sept. 27, which gave Green Bay a strategic upper hand.
