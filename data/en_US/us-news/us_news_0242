In Year 2, Oden missed six games to start the 2008-09 season with what was diagnosed as a mid-lateral foot sprain. There were unanswered questions then about whether Oden's increase in weight (he'd returned from his knee surgery noticeably heavier and stronger) was a contributing factor. He looked sluggish and mechanical on the court. And then, the Blazers center was hurt in a midseason collision with Corey Maggette at Golden State where Oden suffered a bone chip in his left knee. The team announced Oden was "day to day." That soon changed to "out for two games." That diagnosis turned into a week, and beyond, with whispers growing inside the franchise about Oden's toughness and desire.

3. Sun-Sentinel baseball writer Juan Rodriguez did some nimble database work to discover that three of the Cardinals' hitters might really miss the Marlins' old place. Some of the juicier statistical tidbits he discovered: Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman, and Carlos Beltran hit a combined .331 with 24 homers in 399 at-bats at Sun Life Stadium. … Berkman's .615 slugging percentage at the football stadium was the third-best all-time among hitters with at least 120 plate appearances there. Ty Wigginton (.637) and Adrian Beltre (.628) were the only hitters with a better rate. … Holliday slugged .700 in 80 at-bats at Sun Life. … Holliday is a .368 lifetime hitter against the Marlins, and his .676 slugging percentage is the highest of any hitter ever against the Marlins. … Beltran hit .328 at Sun Life, and Berkman batted .317 there. Both ranked in the top 12 at the ballpark.

You may suppose that here an addict of dark days is voicing an aversion to sunlight, and that I exaggerate the effect which the sun has on things, particularly on the appearance of the countryside. I don't think so, and I adduce one curious scrap of evidence to bolster my position. About halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego is a small beach colony, called Balboa. It lies on a lagoon that makes in from the ocean, an inlet perhaps half a mile wide and two or three miles long. This must be fairly deep, as it is a deep, indigo blue. Now this patch of blue is the only thing for miles, nay for hundreds of miles„ that can compete with the sunlight, and nullify it, so that you see things as they really are. As a result, Balboa seems a riot of'color, although it is nothing but a collection of ordinary beach cottages when you get into it. You stop your car when you come to it, feast your eyes on it, as an Arab might feast his eyes on an oasis; think foolishly of paintings depicting Italy and other romantic places.

Back at Leather & Laces, the decor consisted of lots of women in underwear that more often was composed of lace, not leather. Early on, as guests waited to be told if (and when) they could enter, some bare-chested dude entered who may have been French, but was really Russian, wearing kind of Cirque du Soleil-looking pair of goat legs equipped with springs that allowed him to jump maniacally all over the place.

So for about $700 I flew a whopping 19,000 miles between Sept. 7 and Oct. 6. During that time, I climbed Mayan ruins and swam through underground caverns in the Yucatán, dove under warm Caribbean waves in Puerto Rico, took in the Art Deco glory of Miami, dined on fresh lobster in Maine, spent "tummy time" with a friend's new baby in New York, survived a wacky and wonderful bike tour of Bogota, Colombia, and happily teetered through the colonial-era, cobble-stoned streets of the lush, highland village of Villa de Leiva.

Many believe the austerity program is necessary to keep bond investors from panicking about the possibility that more European nations will default or require bailouts.

Like the New York Yankees of American baseball, Real Madrid is built to win championships and loaded with marquee talent like Cristiano Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso, Mesut Ozil and Marcelo Viera.

Yes, Omar Minaya’s farm system has proven more fertile than initially thought. Still, the Mets have been woefully under-supplied to weather a 162-game season. This is how Miguel Batista ends up the sixth starter and the losses of Bay and Mike Pelfrey feel more gut-wrenching then they should.

to contain tuition rate increases without cutting our personnel spending. The best way we can do that - without a reduction in personnel force - is to keep salaries at their current levels and to not automatically fill open faculty and staff positions. I know this does not come as good news for any of you, but it does reflect unanimity on the University's budget planning committee that this action is necessary in light of the continued uncertainty in the nation's economy.

Paying close attention to the Hitler of these home movies gives one a deepened sense of who he was. His smile is mirthless. His gaze is unsteady, or furtive. His eyes are dead, as if he'd been filmed in the sort of cheap motion-capture animation that turns faces into glove puppets. He smoothes his hair with a repetitiveness that amounts to a tic. He gives children ritual pats on the cheek, but reveals his emotional detachment during a 1938 Munich "celebration for dead comrades" when, confronted by a girl convulsed with grief—presumably for her dead father—he administers a pat that amounts to the kind of whack one would give a playful dog. And when a group of puppies first surround him and then ignore him, he seems puzzled and put off. "They don't appreciate a friend," he says to no one in particular. With a friend like Hitler, the puppies must have sniffed something in the wind.

Chef to watch: Gregory Denton at MetroVino. You may think the high-tech Enomatic system containing some 80 wines, all available by the glass, is the star at this new Pearl District spot. No question, it's a great asset (and the only one in Portland). But the firmament belongs to Denton, whose imaginative kitchen ranges across Europe and Asia, intelligently borrowing accents where needed. Dishes like grilled fresh sardines paired with fried artichokes in cream sauce blend homeyness with elegance, classic cooking with inspired innovation, all with a richly light touch.

Responses to the Jones threat were understandable at every stage -- understandable for a competitive press to cover, for a concerned general to confront, for a president to clarify America's commitment to tolerance. But overall, the reaction was a terrible mistake. The idea that an unbalanced pastor with an Internet connection and a poster can cause the highest military and civilian leaders of our nation to respond is an invitation to global crackpotocracy -- rule by the most creative and outrageous lunatics.
Actually, 2012 will get a lot of attention as being the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. It also marks 50 years since John Glenn's orbit of the Earth, Sean Connery's debut as James Bond, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the death of Marilyn Monroe (conspiracy theorists keep that one fresh). Warren Beatty and Marlo Thomas turn 75 this year, and we'll celebrate the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. I imagine the re-enactors are busy getting ready for that one.

Sure, Marmol’s a wild man. But he’s also in the second year of a three-year contract, one that will pay him $7 million this year and $9.8 million in 2013. That’s not quite Alfonso Soriano money, but it’s an awful lot to pay a guy you’re going to stick in the back of the bullpen and pitch only in safe situations.
The first piece, "Printemps," is the work of a young Claude Debussy. It is clearly his work from the first measures: It's Impressionistic, sensuous, with swirling Franco-Asian textures and sounds.

Le Pigeon: First, lose the French accent. Think park bird --that's how Rucker pronounces Le Pigeon. The narrow space typifies how Portland's indie restaurant culture aspires to be fun but deep. Floral, retro-grandma plates, some chipped, live alongside high-ranking wineglasses. Prime seats are at a resin-glazed counter, a structure of high craft made from crushed office furniture. Funny, fast-rapping Rucker is Le Pigeon's charismatic center, working the open kitchen and delivering plates with a kind of hip-hop cool and good-old-boy charm. He's the leader of this underground party, densely packed on most nights with serious feeders, off-duty chefs and seniors who can live with punk music.

Ruth was born in that house in 1895, in an upstairs bedroom that has been re-created in turn-of-the-century decor and opened to the public. The rowhouse neighborhood occupied by the Orioles ballpark and the NFL Ravens' M&T Bank Stadium was once home to seedy rooming houses, brothels, and saloons, like the one Ruth's father operated.
It was all done anonymously, but still very public.

Sgt. Patrick Cummings suffered his second traumatic brain injury when a 155mm shell exploded midbarrel as he and other soldiers fired a howitzer against the Taliban.

The price hike "is about remaining economically competitive in our league and to build a championship team," Bears spokesman Scott Hagel said. "We are the largest single-team market in the smallest stadium.

New Jersey is a state whose reputation for corruption has been immortalized in film, TV and in song by Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi alike. So there's just one question after learning that a new study puts New Jersey at the top of a State Integrity Investigation's ranking of the nation's states in terms of transparency and accountability to citizens.

Late one afternoon we found the old Jewish cemetery on Trumpeldor Street in central Tel Aviv, where many city luminaries were buried. In the thickening twilight, Penny scrambled down a flight of uneven stone steps while I stood at the entrance. The burial ground looked to me like most others, except that the graves were marked by table-like slabs bearing Hebrew inscriptions and stones left by visitors, as in the unforgettable last scene of "Schindler's List."

More than 7 feet tall, this oil on canvas is part of a private collection included in Christie's contemporary sale. The auction house bills the 1961 painting as the most important work by Rothko since "White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose)," which sold for $72.8 million at Sotheby's in 2007, a sum that has yet to be matched for another Rothko work at auction.

Its home is anywhere it is heard and felt. If its heart beats in Cleveland, it is because Cleveland, itself a hybrid and cultural stew, understood from the start and embraced its energy, joy, release, anger, defiance and longing.
OMB Watch, an advocacy organization that tracks federal regulations, said if the bill already had been law, the government would not have been able to issue a finding that greenhouse gases endangered public health. The group said it would have been more difficult to withstand court challenges to findings that a popular weed killer was dangerous. It would have been tougher to defend statements about the health impact of too much salt. And the government would have had to weaken a strong rule on lead in gasoline.
The curtain at "God of Carnage" and "Red" opened a half-hour later than usual, but the shows were not canceled, said spokesman Adrian Bryan-Brown.
The Answer: I just try to get a sense for 'What is the aptitude of this person?' They have to be a good human being, and by that I mean healthy family values, good solid background, a sense that they've accomplished things in the past and they have a drive. But I've always framed it as: What is this person's upside, what have they done with what they've been exposed to so far, and do you get a sense that if they were exposed to even more opportunity that they would grow and run with that?

Do you get the frustration from the fans?
Examples include a so-called "happy seat" workstation that lets a worker glide up to a car and attach electrical components, rather than crawling into the vehicle, and a satellite radio antenna that workers pop onto the back of the car's roof rather than reaching to manually place it in the center. The technology also enables features such as the MKS sedan's ability to "sense" when a driver appears tired and sound an alert.
Police are still investigating what caused the collision.
The chytrid fungus also remains a potent threat. Cane toads and tree frogs in Montserrat are still carrying the fungus but are not affected by it.

The Bank of East Asia (U.S.A.), with approximately $750 million in assets, is a subsidiary of Hong Kong's Bank of East Asia. While it is headquartered in New York, where it has three branches, much of the bank's business is conducted in California.

Maybe a campaign is like a big version of "American Idol." It is a contest over who is the most talented. In this mode, a candidate's job is to endear himself to the audience with likability and then wow them with his gifts.

øAs we saw earlier, a $100,000 payment without an inflation adjustment would pay $598 a month. If inflation were 3% a year, it would take about 12 years to get above $598 a month. It would take much longer to get the same amount of money from the inflation-adjusted annuity as you do from the one with no inflation-adjusted one.
The congressman allowed that he is not very confident his bill will succeed in the face of Republican opposition in Congress, but said, “I have higher hopes that a way will be found.” He said that he thinks congressional Republicans, who have decisively opposed revenue increases, may be considering “ways to raise revenue without calling it that.”
LaFaro said he is disappointed with Meyer's decision. He noted that Meyer acknowledged in his Monday letter that the language on Whitaker's campaign signs "may be ambiguous," which LaFaro argued should have been reason enough to remove the signs.
The goal, according to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, is to make teaching “not only America’s most important profession — but also America’s most respected profession.” School districts and states are expected to compete for their part of the initiative’s funding, which is requested in the 2013 budget, to fund reforms to boost the teaching profession’s profile.
In his first interview since major surgery to implant an artificial pump to assist his heart, Cheney also said President Barack Obama was likely to be a one-term president because his policies were unpopular with the public.

Mitchell, still in her sweet-voiced folk-poet phase, sums up the spirit of the times with "Woodstock." She then segues from her own "Big Yellow Taxi" to a light-hearted cover of Larry Williams’ ’50s rock hit "Bony Moronie," and from her "Carey" to Bob Dylan’s "Mr. Tambourine Man" (with Taylor helping out, gamely though not all that smoothly). Taylor also joins in on her encore, "The Circle Game," though you don’t hear the entire song (the tape ran out).

Roy has not spoken publicly since the day of the announcement, but said the following Thursday in a release from the Blazers:
Germany may, at some point, be so confident about the new fiscal rules that it will be willing to contemplate more radical measures, such as the common issuance of euro-zone bonds. But it won't do that if the new fiscal framework it has fought for melts down in its first year of existence.
"Usually, you’re motivated by fear rather than bravery," he said of that album’s ambition. "I was afraid of losing myself."

She has 73 students in STC's Young Professionals Conservatory, and nearly 350 students during the year are involved in three levels of youth training the theater offers: the conservatory program, summer camp and a pre-professional ensemble.
But it's pure spin, designed to appeal to business-friendly Democratic moderates, a centrist group needed to provide a winning margin. In fact, the laws won't open the floodgates for wide-ranging class-action lawsuits and will allow individual lawsuits only as a last resort or when loan laws are violated. Today, homeowners with heavy mortgages and foreclosure deadlines don't have a chance to hire a lawyer - an advantage that lenders know all too well.
University of Portland coach Eric Reveno said he has noticed a trend toward waiting to sign, explaining it's part of the big picture in youth basketball, where players are constantly searching for better opportunities. Coaches, too, are searching for the best and by spring have pinpointed their needs.

And between them – as both men’s patient, and one’s impatient lover – is Keira Knightley as Sabina Spielrein, who overcomes her serious neuroses to become a gifted analyst herself.
The enemy also understood the psychological potency of an unseen enemy that can strike at any time. Starting in 2005, insurgents released a series of videos showing U.S. soldiers being shot, claiming it was the work of a single sniper who was stalking Baghdad. The video was an effort to strike fear into American troops by raising the specter of an unseen gunman preying on U.S. troops.
Does more equal better? No. All 11 Secret Service johns had their "security clearances" canceled. That still leaves over four million Americans (or about two percent of the adult population) with "security clearances," and, according to the Director of National Intelligence last October, just under 1.5 million federal employees with "top secret" clearances. Which helps explain why one army private was able singlehandedly to download bazillions of (admittedly mostly worthless) "secrets" for Wikileaks. Imagine the entire population of New Zealand with security clearances, and the entire population of Philadelphia or Phoenix with "top secret" clearances.
In July, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said al-Awlaki was a priority target alongside Ayman al-Zawahri, bin Laden's successor as the terror network's leader.

With perfect weather and a full moon, we started walking the half mile to Healdsburg for dinner. After we crossed over a small bridge, we noticed a cat following a short distance behind us. We turned back and, to our surprise, the handsome tabby didn't run away but approached us without fear. He was an intact male, perhaps not fully grown, lean and athletic. This was no ordinary cat; he nonchalantly accepted our petting while very much remaining his own self.

Rep. Chris Kelly, D-Columbia, said the agenda leaves out the biggest job-producing proposal: allowing ratepayers to be billed for an early site permit for a second nuclear reactor in Callaway County. "All the rest, the talk about jobs, is just fingerpainting in the margins compared to the nuclear plant," he said.
The food was good, the atmosphere was great and the look on my daughters’ faces as they met Belle, Ariel, Snow White, Aurora and Cinderella, was worth the $138 that I shelled out for three meals (my 2-year-old’s French toast sticks were free) and a photo package.

Heritage Cabernet plantings were ripped out for Chenin Blanc. A parcel that helped produce the legendary 1941 Cabernet was plowed under to allow a barrel-storage building, a perennial eyesore that became so loathed in Napa Valley as a sign of corporate meddling that Coppola made a public event of its 2007 demolition.

Burgess, of the 1500 block of Robert Thompson Drive in Festus, was in police custody Wednesday.
If you wanted to clear out your junk drawer, or find something in it that was lost, you probably wouldn't hire an expert to do it for you. It's not like you're one of those troubled people they show on the Discovery Channel-you don't have a monumental disorder that requires a team of experts to dismantle. It's just that sometimes a little help, a little companionship, would be nice. Someone to hang out with you while you open up the drawer and go through it. Someone to make a cup of tea and laugh with you about how odd it is that you held on to that rock and now you can't even remember where it came from, or to delight with you that you've finally located your grandmother's ring, the one you thought was lost forever.

It's also important to use only a small amount of yeast. The trick is to add just enough to get the dough started, then set the dough aside for several hours or even overnight, to give the yeast time to do its work slowly. This gives the crust depth of flavor.

If Mozeliak and Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. want to be used by Lozano, it's their business, their pride, their reputations. But from the outside it sure looks like the owner and GM are losing more spine with each passing day.

Worthy, the clinical psychologist from Denver, said parents should guide the conversation gently, asking how their young reader would respond if put in a similar situation, and what family and community values should factor into their decisions.
And so we did. I can verify that the spinach and ricotta gnocchi, often available as a special, are tender little bites sitting on a pool of marinara sauce. Pastas are decent too. Remember that a huge percentage of Argentines have family from Italy generations back, so Italian food is as popular there as it is here.

According to the complaint, Trustmark also deducts certain transactions before debit card items, even though there is no proper reason for doing so. The complaint also addresses other practices of the bank that generate excessive overdraft fees.

Don't worry. They just take the area for granted, and they know it will never replace the beaches on tourist itineraries. But once their lips are loosened, most locals can tell you plenty. The Valley is the home of the oldest Bob's Big Boy diner and perhaps the only porn-star karaoke night in North America. (After all, the Valley is widely known as the nation's porn production capital.) This is where Bob Hope and Ritchie Valens rest in peace, where "Friends" was shot, where Disney makes movies (but doesn't give tours), where the ageless phrase "gag me with a spoon" was born, and where the papa of Patagonia honed his climbing skills.

So of course when Madison Square Garden was sitting on tenterhooks nearly 12 minutes gone in the first period of the first playoff game, the game still knotted in a scoreless tie, it would be Callahan who would figure a way to sneak the puck behind Craig Anderson.

Apple's defenders haven't been shy about criticizing the DOJ, which they say misunderstood what's happening in the e-book market. By their reckoning, the arrival of the iPad and the publishers' shift to the agency model -- in which they set the retail price and the seller takes a commission -- weakened Amazon's stranglehold on the market for e-books and e-book readers, enabling new online book outlets to compete and giving consumers more choices among devices and content suppliers.

If Michael Tilson Thomas is the public face of classical music in San Francisco, Sarah Cahill is its underground soul. Radio programmer ("Then and Now" on KALW-FM 91.7), producer (the annual Garden of Memories walk-through concert) and champion of lesser-known composers and under-played works, Cahill is gradually building a catalog of dazzling solo piano recordings. If you start with her latest, "Leo Ornstein: Fantasy and Metaphor" (New Albion), you'll be introduced to fascinating quasi-retro pieces from 1959-1978 impeccably performed by a sensitive and original interpreter.

They didn't allow a goal during pool play.
Economists say several euro-zone economies do need structural reforms, but these would help growth only in the longer term. Germany's critics say the euro zone will sink deeper into recession without a boost to domestic demand—which would need either less fiscal austerity or more expansionary measures by the European Central Bank.

Rebecca Cox, president of the Princeton Regional School District Board of Education, said her district expects next year to have to send $4.8 million to educate children in two charter schools: the Princeton Charter School, which is open now, and a charter school previously approved to open, that would offer Mandarin Chinese. That is far more than it would cost to educate those children in the Princeton Regional district, she said.

Here's Romney's problem. His best strategy is to cast President Obama as a failure because the economy has not come all the way back from the implosion of 2008.

That's a big concern because, along with developing nuclear weapons, North Korea has long been suspected of trying to field an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, capable of reaching the United States.

"Belt's a guy that we all want to see have success, because we need it," Sabean said. "And he's the type of hitter you want to invest in. ... (But) if you look at the at-bats that don't go too well, there's either a pitch he gets and fouls off, or pitches that he gets and swings and misses. And if you look at his strikeouts per at-bat (13-for-44 this season), it's not necessarily what you want to see."

Roles: Kids can take on any role. If someone wants to be a cat, but there isn't one in the story, the narrator can add a cat. "Let them be what they want to be. Bend the casting," she says. "A little boy might want to be the mom. We've had that. They giggle. We stop the class from giggling and tell them that anybody can be a mom, and we take it from there. Kids like to explore other roles when they're young. It's healthy for them to try to walk in other people's shoes, so to speak."

While it's common for American and European symphonies to offer classes to the public, typically those programs involve longer commitments to a practice schedule, in preparation for a public performance alongside the professional orchestra. San Francisco put a twist on it by offering a one-night experience of hands-on mentoring for adults, with a final run-through at the end of the evening. And they kept it affordable: $40 for instrumentalists, and $20 for singers. Friends and family can sit in the audience. No auditions are required.
Boyle and Beaufoy are fascinated by the kid's reaction to his plight. He's self-reliant, with all sorts of things in his pack that might help. None do. But he won't panic.

He's taken one calculated risk too many and he is perfectly OK with that. He bundles up, as best he can, overnight, and marvels at the way the light plays down into the crack he's stuck in at sunrise. Here's a guy who lives every day as if it might be his last.

A PG&E document reviewed by The Chronicle on Thursday revealed a fifth pipeline on the high-risk list: Line 103, which serves the greater Salinas area. The line crosses the San Andreas Fault and was damaged by landslides in 1984 and 1998, requiring repairs each time.

There are plenty of critics, but the politically active ones seem to be having a tough time recruiting a legitimate challenger. That's not a knock on Michael Nelson, the Cleveland lawyer who is leaning toward another run. But it's fair to ask if Nelson will be more of a threat than the 1.7 percent of primary votes that he received in 2005 suggests. Nelson, so far, seems to be the only one making any real noise.

Director James Cameron makes some people sick.The Vestibular Disorders Association, which educates on inner-ear problems, warns that 3-D movies including Avatar can make some people dizzy and nauseated. The sensations are caused by a “visual-vestibular conflict,” where your eyes tell your brain one thing but your inner ear says something else. In this case, the eyes are convinced they’re moving through a lush alien planet full of blue-skinned people and expensive special effects, while your inner ear says you’re sitting still in an overpriced and chilly theater.

My secret is that I really do not know what I look like; each attempt to sneak a glance reveals a different facade.

And how sad to have deprived myself of the confidence I could have had.

Though the cocktail was made famous by the Bay Area's very own Trader Vic's, tiki expert Otto von Stroheim of Tiki News magazine (tikinews.com) says it was inspired by a Hawaiian drink made with rum and okolehao, a form of moonshine from the ti plant. In the 1946 edition of "Trader Vic's Book of Food and Drink," the scorpion bowl called for nearly 50 ounces of liquid orgeat (almond-flavored) syrup and mint. The recipe changed in subsequent editions of Trader Vic's books, and today, various venues serve scorpion bowls with a combination of light and dark rums and brandy, with different nut liqueurs -- if any nut flavor at all -- in place of orgeat. Bartenders may add other combinations of fruit juices or even top it off with sparkling wine. Still, von Stroheim says the drink recipe is fairly standard among tiki bars.

Aloha taco trucks: Three taco trucks have been drawing loyal customers to an Aloha parking lot for years. The taco trucks settle nearly every day in the Aloha Mall lot at Southwest 185th Avenue and Tualatin Valley Highway, offering everything from burritos to rice plates.

While other filmmakers have referenced "Kane," the links have often felt convenient. But the device works with uncanny perfection with Johnny Carson, right down to the enigma of the "Rosebud" in the life of the Iowa-born, Nebraska-reared boy who vied with his older sister and younger brother for their mother's attention.

The rules set by the budget mean that majority Democrats could potentially pass health care legislation without any Republican votes, sacrificing bipartisanship to achieve their goals.
