_MIKE SCHMIDT, Philadelphia, April 17, 1976. The star third baseman went 5 for 6 and knocked in eight runs as the Phillies beat the Cubs at Wrigley field 18-16 in 10 innings.
Both bedrooms were decrepit. They looked totally worn out and unclean. We were told when we booked that we would have to change cars in Denver, so we decided that we could suffer through one night.
That’s because the owners claim it has nothing to do with the new collective bargaining agreement, and that is specious: The revenue imbalance is the reason they need a new agreement in the first place. Only after the players see the plan can they know what split to offer, what exceptions to demand, even how hard to fight for the existing soft cap.

Overall, the post office had income of $16.2 billion from January through March, the second quarter of its 2012 fiscal year. That was down a fraction from the same period last year. But quarterly expenses this year climbed to $19.4 billion, up 5 percent, largely driven by the health prepayments.
While the play's end may be a bit too pat, the Twilight Repertory actors do a pretty solid job of bringing these ever-so-human characters to life. There are moments when the actors seem to be a little uncomfortable with the tightness of the space and occasionally their blocking seems a bit forced or awkward, but generally director J.J. Hawkins draws honest and convincing performances from all four actors.
He would not say how they died, but Newsday reported that Thomas stabbed Sherelle, then hanged himself.

Through December, both schools are increasingly assigning students to in-school suspensions. At the same time, Audenried and Barratt have reduced their out-of-school suspensions.
Because all the networks are owned by a handful of corporations and everyone's looking for advertising dollars, there are some topics they won't touch. When I was making Crude, everyone was afraid of offending Chevron. There are many opportunities to do branded content, which is advertiser-driven reality television. I'm not knocking it because Iconoclasts is made possible by Grey Goose Vodka. It's been a wonderful partnership. They've been very wise about letting us do what we do. It is paid for by a brand, though, and they do get advertising advantages.
The roots of that talk went back three innings, to the third inning, when the game was suddenly slippery for Verlander.

George Zoffinger, who is nearing the end of his term on the board, criticized the growing amount of debt Rutgers has taken on and the nearly $11 million that comes out of the university budget to subsidize the athletic department.
I went outside to celebrate the temperature drop and cloud cover by weeding. The previous night’s welcomed rain had loosened the soil; no baking sun had dried it out. In early afternoon the zinnia and vinca leaves for once weren’t curled in the heat. The hydrangeas weren’t drooping.
'It's not that unusual," he said. "A month from now it would be unusual."
Corrections officials say this is needed to protect other prisoners from gangsters and to prevent "shot-calling," the passing of orders from imprisoned gang leaders to members. Prisons spokesman Jeffrey Callison says the policy is under review, and a proposed revision would let well-behaved prisoners out of solitary after four years instead of six. But that's still an incredibly long period to serve in solitary confinement, which is often mentally destabilizing.
And there to usher it in was Mayor Newton D. Baker, the only mayor worthy of mention in the same breath with his mentor and friend, Johnson.
Kirk's father also was an influence. Charlie Hoessle retired in 2002 as the director of the Saint Louis Zoo. He spent 39 years with the institution, first as a reptile keeper, then moving up the ranks.

Kosar purposely did not submit the paperwork to be eligible for the regular draft, which upset the Minnesota Vikings, who had traded with Houston for the No. 2 pick in the regular draft. Eventually, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle let Kosar decide which draft he wanted to take part in, and Kosar famously chose the supplemental draft and, thus the Browns, his hometown team.

The choice of sides can become a quandary. It doesn't make much sense to add a choice of dirty rice, rice and beans or potatoes to the spicy jambalaya ($15.95). The melange, thick with chicken, sausage, shrimp and flaky catfish, already has enough fluffy white rice to suffice.
You don't need to pack for the worst-case situation. Pack for the best weather and simply buy yourself out of any cold snaps. Risk shivering for a day (or layer a sweater under your rain jacket) rather than pack a heavy coat. Think in terms of what you can do without -- not what will be handy on your trip. When in doubt, leave it out. The shops on your cruise ship (or on shore) are sure to have any personal items you forgot.
Plainview is visited by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), who tells him of the oil bubbling up beneath the ground on his family's California land. It doesn't take Plainview and H.W. long to get there, and soon they have the lynchpin in Plainview's march to the sea, with only one more landowner holding out. Plainview sets up shop in the community, called Little Boston, building oil rigs and offering the promise of development to the eager residents.

The double hit prompted bank executives to look for new revenue ideas that could be fast-tracked because the outlook for the bank's consumer operations was so bleak, said one person familiar with the planning. That was when it came up with the idea of a $5 monthly fee on certain customers who used their debit cards. It was a plan that could be implemented quickly and wouldn't require a lot of new technology.
"For me 'Tinker Tailor' is not really a spy movie," the director said. "It's a film about friendship and loyalty, and the personal costs for soldiers in the Cold War."

Bush, prompting a major federal effort to help prisoners return productively to society.
A new study brings good news to the 10 million Africans infected by HIV, and the countries that have been decimated by the epidemic: antiretroviral therapy restores patients' life expectancies to close to that of their countrymen and women who are not infected.
Reasons for optimism: If OSU can keep defenses honest with a run game and Katz has time to throw, (Nolan) Ryan K. may be primed for a big year. He is fully recovered from a broken bone in his right wrist that limited him in the spring. Katz – who may have the strongest arm in college football - completed 59 percent of his passes for 2,386 yards and 18 touchdowns in first year as starter. Historically, quarterbacks in Mike Riley’s system have bumped it up a level in their second season as starters. Katz's quick feet and escapability will be needed at times, depending on the effectiveness of the OSU offensive line. ... Vaz proved he could take over the team with a strong spring, but he doesn't possess Katz's physical gifts. ... Mannion looks like a young Sean Canfield in size and arm strength and could be the team's QB of the future.
Read most cookbooks, in either English or Italian, and they'll tell you to fix a frittata pretty much the same way you'd fix an omelet, stirring and scrambling and lifting the cooked egg to let the raw slide through. Then when the eggs have just firmed, turn them over to cook the other side, either with a flip and a flick of the wrist, or by inverting them onto a plate or a lid and sliding them back into the pan.
Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine also emphasized last week's overwhelming vote in favor of Issue 3, a constitutional amendment that registers disapproval with Obama's health care law. Republicans believe that vote is as much a rebuke of Obama's agenda as the SB 5 defeat is a rebuke of Kasich's. GOP leaders see it as a much bigger harbinger for 2012.
"For most of the time, it's been a very good time. We've enjoyed the people and the community. We just can't keep going. Thanks to everyone for all the business and all the good years we've had," she said.
AA lot of folks do want to stay in their home. We need to be able to provide services and companionship and medical and transportation. That will be a bigger part of our business. And there will a nice market for people who don't want to deal with the issues at home. They prefer a "cruise ship" on land. We have to be careful about what and where we build. We're building buildings with 30- or 40-year mortgages.
It does not take a college education to see the hypocrisy in offering to pay for the very services we condemn in our theology classes and seek forgiveness for in our sacraments. It should not be the business of the federal government to force Catholic schools and other Catholic institutions into such a collective violation of our own conscientious beliefs.

The sun rose in a hazy mist. Normandy emerged in monochromatic hues — yellow-brown stucco homes with terracotta roofs, silhouetted church steeples and fields framed with hedgerows. By American standards, the train was fast — probably 110 mph plus — but it was no TGV. When I walked to the end of the coach to close the restroom door, I heard a roar of air and realized the toilet flushed onto the tracks. I haven't seen a "hole in the floor" since the 1970s, when Amtrak was still running cars built in the 1930s.

There is a difference with this project, though, which is the most expensive transportation project in state history. First, the designers and builders will work as a team, hoping to save time and money. Second, the team also will help arrange or provide initial financing. Such "design-build-finance" models are generally used to fill a short-term gap in financing projects, and give states more flexibility, Sia Kusha, vice president of the engineering firm HNTB, said in an interview this spring. According to a statement, the state expects the bidders to loan the state 10 to 20 percent of the project cost.
The Obama administration and the liberal news media continues to keeps up their line that the unemployment rate is between 8 percent 9 percent.

One reason sales taxes are so high in many smaller Arizona urban areas is that it's often difficult politically to raise property taxes due to the widespread unpopularity of those levies, said Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association.

The Obama administration wants to see 1 million EVs on the road by 2015 and has proposed replacing the existing $7,500 tax credit with a $7,500 rebate at the time of sale to spur demand.

Mike Omotoso of JD Power and Associates thinks no more than 700,000 to 750,000 plug-in and pure EVs could be on American roads by 2015.

Everything was well-rehearsed and solidly executed, with both orchestra and chorus tossing off tricky rhythms while negotiating brutally exposed solos and entrances with pinpoint accuracy. These concerts are always about two songs too long, and one audience sing-along is probably enough, but Sparger manages every year to sprinkle in a bit of freshness and variety onto the basic plan, and the result is a lovely early Christmas present.

The thing about Phelps, 23, is that he really isn't absorbing this run the way some others do. I keep seeing his unassuming demeanor, and hearing him talk about how strange is it to see himself on "Good Morning America." He's keeping it in perspective.

It would be easy to deride or dismiss many of Scientology's more eccentric elements, such as the long-held secret story of Xenu, the evil tyrant leader of the "Galactic Confederation." Only after reaching an advanced level are Scientologists taught that he killed his enemies with hydrogen bombs 75 million years ago and then captured their souls, or thetans, and electronically implanted them with false concepts. These altered thetans later glommed on to human bodies, the story goes, causing spiritual harm and havoc for mankind.

The musical plays out like an episode of VH1's "Behind the Music," chronicling the members' roots in New York's folk-music scene, their bonding over booze and LSD in the Virgin Islands, their rapid rise to fame and the love quadrangle and in-fighting that assured their success would be short-lived. This is all familiar territory, although it is not without its voyeuristic appeal, as when songwriter John Phillips discovers his wife, Michelle, has been sleeping with Denny. He can handle a little infidelity, he says, but he refuses to let his woman get between him and "my tenor."

The Phillies punished Pineda for six runs in just 2⅔ innings — the latest development in what has been a difficult spring.
Such down-home touches seemed a bit surreal when juxtaposed with the dazzling beauty of Krauss’ voice and the world-class musicianship that makes her simple songs so resonant. She and the band shifted smoothly from the gently rolling country of “Every Time You Say Goodbye” to the crisp bluegrass of “Sawing on the Strings” and the stately balladry of Richard Thompson’s “Dimming of the Day.” Guitarist Dan Tyminski occasionally sang lead vocals, his bracing tenor balancing Krauss’ pliant soprano; his “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,” which helped make “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” a soundtrack hit in 2001 (George Clooney lip-synched it in the movie), was the last song before the encores.

We haven't served those for the past five years. As we started to grow and move into new markets, we wanted to make sure that the perception of us as a brand wasn't tied to that three-foot glass.

“That was the worst statement of the year, by any coach in the league, this year,” he said. “How could you say that? He just broke an NFL record for your team (for 42 downed punts inside the 20-yard line) and you threw him under the bus?”

But while Bridges holds the line, it is the massive upgrade in talent in the rest of the cast that leaves the 1969 version of "True Grit" quaking in its boots.
“I don’t know what happened, he’s just become so much more aggressive,” Altman said. “He’s finally finishing plays and … you can tell that he wants to go to the rim. I’m not sure if he had a revelation while he was sitting there (on the bench) and figured something out, but whatever it was, I like it.”
But it doesn't work out. Sentilles struggles too much with the judgment in so many people's attitudes toward faith and God, especially self-proclaimed God-fearing people who use religion to attack other people's sexuality and lifestyles. As an apprentice pastor she learns that no one wants to hear provocative political talk from the pulpit even though, she says, "faith and politics weren't separate for me … I went to divinity school … because I thought churches could help make the world more just and life-giving for everyone." After struggling with an Episcopalian discernment committee helping her make a decision about her vocation, she calls it quits.

Raising the federal excise tax on gasoline by 10 cents per gallon every calendar quarter for the next 10 years would bring the tax up to current European levels, which are about $4 a gallon. Knowing that the price is going to increase would encourage consumers to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles, which would spur investment in innovation, e.g., electric vehicles.
"It's good for the neighborhood because it gets people talking to each other, and it gets people out and about," said Ellen Cusick, co-chair of the Boise Neighborhood Association.

Adding an electric vehicle or two to a neighborhood can be like adding another house, and it can stress the equipment that services those houses.

Content marketing can provide you with a competitive advantage because you can showcase your expertise and more importantly value without selling. The sooner this is embraced, the sooner you can begin to realize results.
Gets my vote: Given the history of Cannery Row, it doesn't get much more local than bucatini pasta with smoked local sardines ($21) or the Monterey-style cioppino ($25), which includes mini cheese ravioli and artichokes in a spicy Dungeness crab broth, plus swordfish, mussels, clams and calamari. Sauteed Californian sturgeon is on the three-course chef's menu ($45, $60 with wine pairings), along with local asparagus soup with goat cheese and prosciutto and Boschetto al Tartufo cheese with wildflower honey and crostini. I've also made a light meal out of Monterey Bay calamari fritti, which include crispy green beans, lemon and shaved parmesan served with chipotle aioli ($11).

She praised the author's "prodigious research and hundreds of long, on-the-record interviews, including sessions with Obama himself," which allow Remnick to lay "in bricks of insight from likely and unlikely sources -- Colin Powell and Obama's sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, historian Jill Lepore and Mark Salter (John McCain's alter ego)."
In 2003, Quintero came to the United States, looking for employment to support his family after his father died. He arrived on a 90-day visa waiver, a program that enables travelers from a select number of countries to enter the United States without a visa.

The kids chose to put it towards motivational banners for the school, stationary bikes and treadmills. They send in all their information to NFL Fuel up to Play 60 and if they meet all the criteria (logging their eating habits and exercising), they are granted the money.

What it means. The Dodgers came into town as the National League's hottest team with a 16-6 record, but the Rockies took two of three from them. After a day off Thursday, the Rockies host the Braves for three games with a chance to turn what's been a mediocre homestand (3-3) into a solid one.
Born in 1928 and raised in Brooklyn, Sendak said he remembered the tears shed by his Jewish-Polish immigrant parents as they'd get news of atrocities and the deaths of relatives and friends.

Task your child (or children) with keeping an eye on what's thrown in the trash versus what's put in the recycling bins. Explaining that everything from soda cans to pasta boxes can be recycled will help him or her to fully understand the importance of limiting waste.

Walking up the valley from our rocky landing zone, we stopped every 10 yards to examine a plant or geologic feature, Lopez-Forment explaining its significance to the ecosystem and to early Mexican Indians, and every 5 yards or so he would lift a rock or check under bushes for scorpions and rattlesnakes. By the end of the short trip, we sighted nine varieties of cacti, 22 other plants from jojoba to wild cucumber, and a range of birds from a butterfly-size hummingbird to ravens that would have made Poe flinch. No rattleless rattlesnakes, but he seemed to take great joy in finding the tiny scorpion. Maybe too much.
The British Aardman team re­freshingly makes few concessions for American sensibilities (only the most devoted Anglophiles will catch the Blue Peter and Slocombe references) and none for children. Gideon Defoe's script, based on his series of books, is filled with humor that challenges as it amuses.
Keegan said Adjutant General David S. Baldwin recommended to federal authorities that a "senior officer," whom Keegan would not name, have his federal recognition withdrawn.

Albert Pujols. It's hard to know where Peyton Manning will end up, but Pujols has a strong supporting cast, a team built to contend, and a lineup that should be able to nourish his ability to hit. He'll be able to do his job a lot deeper into his 30s than Manning will be able to do his. Manning is coming back from a serious injury to a game that causes serious injury. The difference between them is the difference between a red no-contact jersey and the designated hitter. One still plays the game.

So some people simply stay at their jobs as the birthdays tick past. Others start their own businesses.

Or retrain -- often in community colleges -- for jobs in growing industries such as health care, education, nonprofit work, technology and services for the elderly.
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority collapsed during the Gaza war in 2009, and have remained frozen due to disagreements over Israeli settlement construction.

That is, unless you’re really in the mood for “The Smurfs” in 3-D. Or an Arnie-less “Conan the Barbarian.” Or blood-from-a-stone sequels like “Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World” and “Final Destination 5.”
We three used to hang out all of quarterfinals day. Four games, wall to wall hoops. I could write about something other than the night games most years, so we would be able to watch the last pair of games together in the emptying stands.

The World Class City folks are just a few of many people who are calling for consolidation these days. Re-entry of the city as a municipality within the county has been proposed publicly by Slay several times, and Dooley has suggested he's open to the idea. The business community, too, buzzes with the unification prospect. Last summer, the St. Louis Regional Chamber and Growth Association took its annual leadership trip to Indianapolis, where several sessions focused on that region's four-decade experiment in city-county merger. And all sorts of organizations - from grass-roots groups to the chief executives' forum Civic Progress - are brainstorming approaches to consolidation.

"We'd talked about some deals at the end of spring training,'' he said. "We'd been trying to acquire relief pitching since the end of the winter, and an area we feel we have some surplus and young players we want to play is in the outfield.''
Off to the east, Cantrell pointed to a couple of hens sneaking through the woods, followed by a large gobbler. Every so often, the big tom would fan his tail, showing off for the hens. He never gobbled, but his presence put an end to the gobbling from the bird Cantrell had been talking to for so long. That bird flew down and wandered off, rather than challenge the big boy.
Both occurred in areas where daily safety is not a certain thing. Both targeted people who had gone to great lengths to seek an education. The two USC students were known as hardworking young people from China. The Inglewood father, Frederick Martin Jr., had overcome the challenges of growing up in a crime-plagued neighborhood to go on to a college degree. Both were members of tight-knit communities -- in Martin's case, his family; for Ming Qu and Ying Wu, their fellow engineering students from China. The victims in both L.A. and Inglewood were apparently just going about their daily lives in total innocence.

The recipe also features quinoa, a grain used in many vegetarian recipes. "It's a high-protein grain and has a lot more protein than a lot of beans," Vutetakis said. He uses quinoa as a binding mechanism.
And like chefs in five-star restaurants, they're constantly "tasting" the product to ensure quality. I did the same with the Old Mammoth Stout. I think 72 "tastes" of beer that averages 8.9 percent to 11 percent alcohol in an eight-hour day is reasonable, don't you?

"They'll go after the millionaires first and then those slightly below millionaires. It's a slippery slope," she said. "They need to look at the entire tax system and revise the whole system."
Cooper, 27, also developed a reputation as a soft player both inside and outside the organization. The 6-foot-3, 215-pound Cooper ranked fifth in MLS with 56 fouls suffered, but he often found himself on the turf, hoping to induce the referee into calling a foul on the opponent. The style didn't always sit well with Wilkinson and Spencer, two individuals known for tough and hard-nosed reputations during their playing careers.
Muhammed turned off at Exit 24 in Tewksbury and headed north on Route 523 for a half-mile before losing control and driving into a telephone pole, authorities said.
The City Club goes through this debate every local election cycle because crowded ballots are a Portland tradition. Nine people want Saltzman's seat this year. Twelve people ran for mayor two years ago. Some groups in town offer everyone whose name appears in your mailbox to speak. Those are invariably the least informative forums or debates; there's no give and take between candidates, no time for in-depth questions to make sure an idea is as good as it might sound at first blush.
Eric Hovee of the consulting firm E.D. Hovee & Co., which is conducting the study, said he's looking into how national trends may be affecting the area but has not yet dug into the effects of the street closure.

The gambit largely failed as horrified Arab audiences watched the regime's increasingly bloody crackdown on what began as peaceful protests—and were reminded by Assad's opponents that he has kept the Israel front largely quiet.

Today, the public got its first look at the schematic design for the project, as well as the overall budget and work schedule. Friday, the Cleveland Planning Commission will hear presentations from the designers, LMN Architects and Gustafson Guthrie Nichol, both of Seattle.
So can the Red Bulls. The fact is, Marquez, the Mexican national team captain and a World Cup veteran, has not had much of an impact on the gate. Red Bulls fans will put up with any player not playing well as long as he is giving his all, but Marquez has never done that and any good will he had stored up is long gone.

Now that we have a new health reform law, which has created coordinated care organizations designed to transform Oregon's Medicaid system, we need to focus on policy and systemic change for being healthy. We need policies that will increase cultural competency training for health professionals and create a funded system for multiracial/multilingual community health workers. This strategy ensures social and family support for target populations by providing language access and cultural competency in a system of integrated social services and health care.

"We had him as the third-best player in the entire draft when he was coming out," Lande recalled. "He ran a 4.68 (at the combine), and all of a sudden we come back for our next meeting and our scouting department had moved him down to a third-round pick."

Bill Schultz founded Alignmed in Santa Ana after 10 years of episodes of lower back pain. His own search for an alternative to back surgery led him to a Newport Beach chiropractor who had developed a garment originally intended for rehabilitation after shoulder surgery.
Accent lighting: This type of lighting allows you to create dramatic spots of light as well as efficiently illuminate an entire entry. Typically, using narrow–beam light bulbs lets you direct the eye to those objects or places in the room you find most visually appealing. Create atmosphere around artwork or photographs, as we have done here with our track lighting system. A flexible line–voltage design lets you place multiple pendant lights and spotlights anywhere along the track with 10" in between. Wall sconces are another option for a small entry. They attach to the wall, so no surface or floor space is used.

The Lancet study does have some additional data not reviewed by the FDA - -and not entirely typical for such an article: comparisons between Qnexa's effectiveness for weight loss and that of two other drugs vying for the potentially vast U.S. market for weight-loss drugs. These other weight-loss-drug candidates, commercially known as Lorcaserin and Contrave, haven't won FDA approval either, but both remain under consideration. In a box labeled "research in context," the authors offer a comparison that is certainly not apples to apples but which may give Qnexa some competitive edge: In studies performed by other researchers using different populations of subjects under different circumstances, the authors of the Lancet study note, Qnexa promoted greater weight-loss than Contrave, Lorcaserin or Orlistat (a fat-blocking drug long on the market).
"I think it's an embarrassment for the community in Atlanta," Zaretsky said. "It's in a community that really needs the kinds of jobs and economic development that a properly developed public market would bring. It really deserves to be a showcase for that community and for Atlanta. What they need is not spiffing up but a whole new development plan and vision that puts it front and center as one of the most important institutions in the community."

Hill posted a remarkable 29.3 yards per catch average in his senior season at Georgia Tech, but only caught 28 passes in the run-first offense.

I said, "We're not going outside." I would invoke the French existentialist Sartre: There's no exit. And then it would become a really cool creative idea, to not spend the time and money to go to New York.
Schmitt said at least 12 sites would qualify for the zones. They include former auto assembly plants in Hazelwood and Fenton and large parcels in St. Charles County, along the riverfront in St. Louis and in the NorthPark development east of Lambert.

My sister-in-law, Trisha, showed it to me a few weeks ago. She handed me her iPad.
Because the church's impromptu Mass would be celebrated by Bozek (whom the Roman Catholic church doesn't consider a priest) in the sanctuary of St. Stanislaus (which the archdiocese doesn't consider a Catholic parish), it would not be a Mass, at least as defined by the Catholic Church.
A St. Clair County sheriff's investigator interviewed Belanger's wife and their five children ages 3 to 8. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services implemented a safety plan for the children.

"Plenty of tickets still remaining for all three games. I would remind the public that if games are not played they will receive a full refund."
The mammoth, 2,074-page bill would, for the the first time, require most Americans to carry health insurance. It would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to help those with lower incomes afford coverage.
Maybe it’s because of the tension between self-advocates who deserve to be valued for who they are and parents, like myself, who live their own reality and devote their lives to making their children healthier and stronger, and our continued attempts (sometimes failed ones) at seeing eye-to-eye.
Heck, except for the fact that she's the one who hired the woman now calling for her to be impeached, she seems like she's doing well enough.
Chavez hurt himself when he dove for J.J. Hardy's double down the third base line in the fifth. He didn't leave the game until he was at the plate in the bottom of the inning with a 1-2 count.

He took, and missed, one shot in the first quarter. He seems determined to "let the game come to him," but much more of this and there will be no games for months.
I’m a little confused. You mention a husband at the beginning of your question, but then don’t reference him or his involvement in any of these “other” encounters with these “other” men. That’s the biggest danger you face here: his not knowing or being against all this sleeping around. Could he possibly know and be OK with all this behavior?
There were to be tables with umbrellas and chairs, you see, and a food kiosk. “This spells Starbucks: a place to hang out all day and have coffee,” one board member said contemptuously. “It’s a destination of its own.”

Zoning rules allow the construction of the eatery with the hot-pants-clad servers, despite mounting opposition from neighborhood residents.
"One of the things that really drove me crazy was the way in which college kids, in particular, are educated to think that ideology is dangerous and bad. They'll say, 'Mr. Goldberg, that sounds like an ideological statement,' when I'm talking about tax cuts or something. Well, first of all, of course it's an ideological statement -- I'm a conservative, I was asked to come here and be an ideological conservative."

David Tyree’s spectacular leather-on-helmet catch is, rightfully so, remembered as the marquee play on that drive, the one where Giants history was made and the one that earned them their first Super Bowl title since 1990-91. But with that 2-yard gain on fourth-and-1, Jacobs and the offensive line kept it going, saving a timeout along the way and providing just enough of a breather to bring on two entirely different sets of personnel.
"We didn't really want to trap them. We wanted to run and jump to get to the legs," he said. "And for us to have Draymond (Green) bring the ball up was great ... because then he wouldn't have as much energy as he would other times. Certain people, we try to create steals or traps or rotate. Tonight we just tried to get into our zone, wear them out and neutralize the backboard.

Boehner argued, "I've always believed the bigger the government, the smaller the people. And right now, we've got a government so big and so expensive it's sapping the drive out of our people and keeping our economy from running at full capacity. The solution to this crisis is not complicated."

One study that compared the incidence of post-operative dysfunction in patients who had regional anesthesia (i.e. nerve blocks and the like) versus those who had general anesthesia did not find a difference. This study makes it hard to believe that it is the anesthesia and not the surgery that is the culprit.
The icy crystals turn a brilliant ruby from the fruit, and are balanced by a cool, citrus chantilly cream - essentially just whipped cream with vanilla flavoring and powdered sugar. Fold a few orange segments in for texture and a surprising bite, and pile the dessert into a martini glass. At the conclusion of a long, heavy holiday meal, it might be exactly the refreshing ending you need.

Schottenheimer was the Chiefs’ coach in the 1990s, when NFL players’ salaries began to skyrocket. In 1996, Smith and Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas were among the league’s highest-paid players. Both earned at least $3 million annually, and in Kansas City, they lived like kings. But they also gave back: Thomas started the Third and Long Foundation, a program devoted to curbing illiteracy among urban youths.

Award of Excellence: Antonio’s Brick Oven Pizza, 453 Main St., Metuchen; (732) 603-0008. If there’s one shortcoming to Jersey pizza, it’s the lack of sauce. The deep-dish margherita at Antonio’s is a tomatoey, crusty success. There may be bigger names on the Middlesex County pizza map, but no one does a margherita better than Antonio’s.

Jin W. Kang, a business owner, said Korean merchants in the city worked to improve community relations after heightened tensions in the 1980s with residents in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, and after a spate of robberies — including some homicides — in the late 1990s.
The French had in mind to design a city that was "almost a textbook example of the Enlightenment mania for balance, order, and clarity," and indeed the checkerboard grid of the original Vieux Carre, or French Quarter, is still clearly visible today. But the French did not reckon with the populace of New Orleans, from the outset "famous for 'excessive stubbornness,' " not least because it included an impressive number of "convicts, smugglers, and deserters." The orderly settlement envisioned in Paris quickly degenerated into an economy "steeped in smuggling; in fact, it thrived on contraband trade to a degree that is still underestimated." Powell writes: "All the town's pillars of respectability — governors, commandants, members of the Superior Council, from Bienville on down — connived at and joined in the contraband trade. ... Simply put, smuggling was Louisiana's lifeline, and New Orleans's as well."
"These events are too far apart to be of direct influence to each other," he said.
In the mid-1960s, a Johns Hopkins University psychologist, Mary Ainsworth, developed an experiment known as "the Strange Situation": A young child plays with her mother in a room. Her mother leaves, and a stranger remains. Then the mother returns. Most children were distressed when their mothers left the room, says Robert S. Marvin, director of the Mary D. Ainsworth Child-Parent Attachment Clinic, in Charlottesville, Va.
"They did make some changes, and move some precincts out of 42 back into (District) 8, (and) from District 7 into 42," said Del. Bill Frank, who represents the 42nd District. "But essentially, 85 percent of the (advisory committee's) original plan remains intact."
Choy is the author of "The Architecture of San Francisco Chinatown," a new booklet published by the Chinese Historical Society of America. It doesn't skimp on design specifics - a glossary clues in readers on the fine points of soffits and loggias - but the focus is on why the storied neighborhood looks the way it does.
Last fall, a federal judge dismissed several claims by shareholders. Even though Mr. Mudd had made statements in 2007 noting that Fannie Mae wasn't heavily exposed to subprime loans, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty threw out many of the investors' claims on grounds that the firm's public filings "contained cautionary language that warned investors" about increased mortgage risks.

"We tried their ideas for nearly a decade, and it didn't work out so well," Obama said in a jab at Republicans. "We can't go back to the same policies that got us into this mess.

Gartland pleaded guilty April 10 to unrelated cases of bribery and funneling illegal campaign contributions.
Although even China took an economic hit in 2008 and 2009, the pace of growth here is astounding. At a dinner with foreign correspondents on Monday, three of them separately told me that when they have been away from Beijing for even a year or two, they almost have to relearn the city when they get back because there invariably are so many new buildings and so much more traffic.
