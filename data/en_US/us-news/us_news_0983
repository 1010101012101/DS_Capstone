7. HONOR GUARD: The highest honor that a baseball person can achieve greeted Whitey Herzog in July, and the highest honor a civilian can receive was awarded Stan Musial this past month. Herzog, the Cardinals' beloved manager, was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame this past year. Musial will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in February. Both honors illustrate the power of persistence. Herzog had an influential group of Hall of Famers and decision-makers pushing for his induction through the years. Musial had Cardinals Nation. As part of their desire to increase the franchise's social-media footprint, the Cardinals rolled out the "Stand for Stan" campaign on Facebook, Twitter and the team's official Web site. That goosed politicians to again remind the White House of Musial's contributions to the country and his place as a civic icon in St. Louis. With both campaigns having been successful, it will be interesting to see what unifies the masses next. Retire 51? A number for Medwick? Or, a New Year's Day NHL game at Busch Stadium III?

Nagging can become a prime contributor to divorce when couples start fighting about the nagging rather than talking about the issue at the root of the nagging, says Howard Markman, professor of psychology at the University of Denver and co-director of the Center for Marital and Family Studies.

He says that while all couples deal with nagging at some point, those who learn to reduce this type of negative communication will substantially increase their odds of staying together and keeping love alive. Couples who don't learn often fall out of love and split up.

The Portland Trail Blazers lost their fourth consecutive road game, again blowing a second-half lead and failing to find offense late in Sacramento on Thursday night.
The Antinori family now counts 26 generations in the wine business in Tuscany, Italy. That's quite a history. But in the Napa Valley, it's much shorter. Though Marchese Piero Antinori bought an estate on Atlas Peak in the 1980s, the family produced its first wine, a Cabernet, only in 2001.
Baltimore Racing Development is a cumbersome company headed by three of five board members who have zero event-throwing experience and who allowed and continue to allow executive level folks who also have zero event-throwing experience to speak for and make decisions for the company. These are the same people who misled vendors, misled the public, and misled the city as to their competence and the company's solvency and the same people who are clearly still in the BRD office, probably working just as ineffectively. Now BRD is once again talking about hiring another CEO with no event-throwing experience, which brings to mind the definition of insanity.
Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 131 points to 12,857 and the Standard & Poor's 500 futures are off 14.5 points at 1,360.7. Nasdaq composite index futures fell 22.25 points to 2,652.

In the past year, Abbott pulled its weight-loss drug Meridia for safety reasons, and two other, smaller drugmakers suffered setbacks when federal regulators refused to approve their drug candidates.
He is a strong, rangy runner, who reminds me a little of UO freshman Mac Fleet. Fleet, of course, has had a bang-up rookie season already at the college level.
In a performance that probably sent more than a few shivers down the spines of the upper echelon teams in the West, Brandon Roy on Tuesday scored 21 points, including 10 in a pressure-packed fourth quarter to help the Blazers beat Dallas 104-101.
"And it was just like repetition shots you take before the game, and I got into a good rhythm."
The Lions are in the market for multiple upgrades in the secondary after losing cornerback Eric Wright in free agency and giving up 90 points and more than 900 yards passing in their final two games last season.
In hard-hit New Jersey, politicians debated the merits of a law that leaves the Senate president in charge of the state when the state's top two leaders -- in this case Gov. Chris Christie and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno -- are absent. Christie is vacationing at Disney World in Florida until Thursday, Guadagno in Mexico.
As word of Chen Guangcheng's flight surfaced and spread last Friday, admirers rushed to popular Chinese social media to cheer him on — and the censors swung into action to block key phrases.

Now the mess just keeps getting bigger. I asked County Counsel John Sansone where he came up with the idea that what Ekard had done was acceptable under state law. He forwarded me the explanation he had given a U-T reporter. In it, Sansone cited the California Supreme Court's 2009 ruling in the Vargas v. City of Salinas case.
Most Democrats opposed the bill, and the White House has threatened a veto, but Minnesota's U.S. House delegation supported the measure 6-2, with Democrats Collin Peterson and Tim Walz joining the state's four Republicans in backing it. McCollum and Rep. Keith Ellison cast the no votes.

Why: The Bretons are better known for reds from Chinon and Bourgeuil, but these Loire wizards have a deft hand with Chenin Blanc, too. "Sec" is pushing it a bit, as there's sweetness quietly sitting in the corner in the 2009. But the soapstone and spruce aromas, and a sweet pear and apricot profile, hit the balance so often lacking in Vouvray. Always crowd-pleasing and a perfect seafood foil.

In grabbing the county lead for the first time this spring, the UCLA-bound senior split the first 100 in 56.58. She almost matched that split in her final 100 with a swift 57.54. Rankin qualified second in the 200 free to Irvine's Emily Jiang, who clocked the No. 1 time with a 1:51.73. Rankin touched second in 1:53.05.
øI know it's an old person's sport - that cliché about how you read them to make sure yours is not among the day's offering might be true - but I've been reading obits for decades. For some reason I find it fascinating to see someone's life summed up in a few stark paragraphs.

Even the most ardent fan probably won't be hitting backhands at Wimbledon or racing around a NASCAR track at 187 mph. Yet when the big boys' golf tour comes out West, it tends to hit courses that any of us can play. Here are three that might help you feel like a pro:
The international exposure he received from the Till story eventually led Wesley to a publishing deal. The publishing company, Cune Press, was founded in 1994 to help market books about the Middle East.
One of the main difficulties with post-operative dysfunction research is that patients who have general anesthesia are patients having surgery: Major surgery has major effects -- on the cardiovascular system, and on the immune system, for example.
A: We have a 2-acre garden where we source about 50 percent of our produce. The rest comes from either GreenLeaf (a produce, specialty food, dairy and cheese purveyor), local farmers or our two foragers. It took me about 10 years to develop this network, to bring foragers and fishermen down here to sell not just to me but to other local restaurants. When I first arrived, there wasn't a lot of variety, especially in the wintertime. It's hard to survive on Brussels sprouts, you know?
Last year, 27 state lawmakers received additional income from non-elected positions, including Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex), who makes $83,000 as an Essex County administrator, and Majority Leader Joseph Cryan (D-Union), who makes $112,000 as a Union County undersheriff.

But if you think it's time to ask Dad for the keys permanently, there's good news: Most seniors know when it's time to stop driving. So you may be surprised when you have the "turn-in-your-keys" talk with your dad. Make sure you have alternative ways for him to feel (and stay) independent: Local services can provide rides when he needs them, but set up a list of friends and family he can call when he wants to go to the store, the bank or a ballgame. And remember, the guy who taught you to drive may need time to adjust to this change in his life, so give him the understanding he needs, just like he gave you.
The Oriental Nicety -- a 987-foot oil tanker that was known as the Exxon Valdez when it was launched by shipbuilding giant NASSCO in 1986 -- was been purchased by Maryland-based Global Marketing Systems for $16 million, says Bloomberg News.

"It was just another idea that popped into my head." At 64, the founder of Terracommercial is set for life and semiretired, but he remains a jack-of-all trades with a working-class soul. After learning how to weld and operate machinery on his grandfather's cherry farm, he earned degrees in math and computer science from San Jose State and Stanford universities.
Hohm, 41, determined after his 2009 Ironman he had sacrificed too much strength and speed on the way to completing that event and wanted to find a way to become a more well-rounded athlete.
The gun-tracking operation has been in the GOP’s sights ever since problems with the program came to light. The program run out of the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought to track the guns that were being purchased in the U.S., but many of the weapons were lost. Several showed up at crime scenes on both sides of the border.

Stanford and Virginia Tech did have one common opponent — the ACC's Wake Forest. Stanford beat the Demon Deacons by 44 points. Virginia Tech won by 31 points. You can't glean much from that. More indicative to me were the way Boise State and Florida State — teams which compare with Stanford offensively — each ran up 33 points against Virginia Tech, which prides itself every year on having a tough defense. Maybe not this year. Those two 33-point performances by opponents (one in the season's first game, one in the ACC title game) tell me Stanford should be able to light up the scoreboard in tonight's game. I'm not sure the Hokies have seen anything like Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. He's going to have a big night.
We are all for fighting terrorism and finding tools of terrorist groups outside and inside America; let's partner and not single out one community based on their faith. This is contrary to the morals, principles of America our homeland.

Architect Offenhauser, who recently retired, said he figured the bathroom count in custom homes by starting with two for the master bedroom and one for each bedroom. Then he'd add a couple of powder rooms and a bathroom for the swimming pool. And then he prepared himself for the client to ask for even more.
"In this man, we have a person of conviction," Ryan said at Lawrence University before Romney gave a speech panning Obama's economic record. "We have a man with the right kind of experience.

The new revival of Edward Albee’s 1980 play “The Lady From Dubuque” may be set in an upscale house filled with fancy art, but the emotions are raw, often brutal. People speak with a jarring coarseness. “Jesus, you can’t ever go take a leak around here!” Carol (Tricia Paoluccio) complains loudly. Her boyfriend, Fred (C.J. Wilson), is a brute. Lucinda (Catherine Curtin) is always several steps behind everybody else, and she gets mocked — by friends and playwright alike — for her stupidity.

TORONTO — Deron Williams was in a good mood Thursday morning, probably the best mood he’d been in all season. And there was an obvious reason for that. The Nets were about to play their final game of the wretched, injury-ravaged 2011-12 season in the Air Canada Centre against the Toronto Raptors.

"I take personal accountability ... to make sure we get things right going forward."
Under that approach, the city would simply lease the parking garages to private investors for as much as 50 years.

Hey, Tony: I went out with some friends, who are Steelers fans, to watch the game at a local pub that had NFL Network. McCoy threw some good passes and some terrible ones. When he got hurt and Seneca Wallace came in, Wallace threw a good pass to put the Browns at first and goal. Why do you think the Browns yanked Wallace? Why not leave him in at least long enough to see if they can score. Having Wallace play some might answer whether the problem really is the new system, the receivers we have or the play of the QB. The few times I have seen McCoy play I am unimpressed with his accuracy and arm strength. Do you think Wallace should have stayed in the game? -- Erol Altug, Stony Brook, N.Y.

And it's Clooney's voice - as Matt King, a real estate lawyer with a family line going back to Hawaii's earliest colonial days - whose gentle rumble guides us through Alexander Payne's transcendent tragicomedy. Of course, we see the actor's face, and plenty of him: surprised, angry, sad, vulnerable, loving, foolish, comically discombobulated. But there's something about Clooney's timbre, his quiet, kicked-back intonations, that lead us to the heart of this character. Like the music on the soundtrack - wonderful slack-key guitar from the great Gabby Pahinui and other Aloha State pickers - Clooney's voice reflects the rhythms of the life here, its joys and its sorrows, for this man whose whole world is being upended.
I'm not going to pretend I have even a sliver of the football knowledge that Cameron does. But I will say, and I think the Sun's archives would back me up here, that I've been arguing for three years that the Ravens needed to put Flacco in the shotgun more and pick up the tempo of the offense. I don't know why exactly, but he just sees the field better. And when you get him to the line of scrimmage faster, with more time on the play clock, I think it's obvious he has more time to survey the defense and anticipate what they're going to do.

The MDA proposals were far short of attaining that consistency with the sludge regulations.
Kerry J.

Sensitive over the impact of inflation on its population, China in past years used price controls to blunt the impact of rising fuel prices. But it has allowed increases in recent months as inflation fears have eased and Beijing has shifted its emphasis to growth amid softer global demand for its exports.

One more thing can’t be helping Romney in Michigan: his opposition to the federal bailout of General Motors and Chrysler in 2009.

“I think our guys like the way we were playing the game in the second period and in the third period. We felt that if we continued to do what we were doing, we would continue to push for win. It doesn’t guarantee anything. I do think that there is confidence in our group.

I think the challenges that come up through the course of the season or the playoffs, our guys have done a nice job with it.”

I've long been a proponent of spaying and neutering, as anyone who knows me or who has read my columns through the years knows. Early on in my rescue career, I realized that preventing unwanted puppies just might be the No. 1 way to lessen the number of animals who die in our shelters. And my frustration with people who don't perform this relatively simple surgery because they're too lazy or it costs too much (more on that in a minute) or they want to have puppies that are just like their dogs hasn't dissipated over the years.

One of his greatest shots came in November of 2008, when he hit a 31-foot shot with 0.8 seconds left to beat Houston in overtime at the Rose Garden. The shot, a turnaround jumper after catching an inbounds pass, was lofted so high that coach Nate McMillan later said "it was like it came out of the clouds."

The Tigers have the best chance of anybody to secure the league's best record. They might not have the best team. But they look like they have the best team relative to their schedule, because major league teams play so many games against their division. The Yankees, for example, must face the Rays, Red Sox and Blue Jays in their division (along with an Orioles franchise that is so lifeless, they should put a dead bird on their caps). Last year, the Yankees went 39-33 against the AL East; the Tigers went 50-22 against the Central.

At 11pm that night my father, my cousin, and myself, rendezvoused in the funeral home's deserted parking lot. We slipped into the building through its back door, entering the section of the building blocked off from the public.

In the northern foothills of the Pyrenees mountains lies one of two French locales that claim a sparkling tradition predating Champagne. Documents detail the 1531 discovery of a sparkling wine method by a monk at the Benedictine abbey in nearby Saint-Hilaire.

Mom would make Lebanese bread two to three times a month, and each time she would keep some dough out to fry and always had some extra to make what we called tomato bread. This was long before pizza shops popped up all over and long before pizza with anything more than cheese came into being. She would pat out the dough, spread some olive oil all over the top and top it with her homemade tomato sauce. A little bit of salt and some oregano, and we had our tomato bread -- aka Lebanese pizza to my friends. -- Jennie Shantery

However, a growing number of politicians, like France’s Hollande, say the cuts have been too much, too fast. They say the region’s economy can’t return to growth unless governments stop tightening the fiscal noose and start spending again to create demand. Some economists also now believe that the cuts have to be accompanied by some government economic stimulus to promote growth.
Tied at a set apiece with big-hitting 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro when play was suspended because of darkness a night earlier, Djokovic quickly faced two break points today. He saved those, then broke del Potro in the next game, and that was pretty much that.
O’Neill had already made his feelings known about the proposed cap back in July when it was first announced. “I was not expecting to leave the district for another three to five years,” O’Neill said in July. “But if this cap goes through, I expect I would tender my resignation in January to allow the district ample time to find a new superintendent and would retire effective July 1.”

Don't believe the hype. As the authors make clear, America in 2012 is facing a political crisis, not an economic one. It's called inertia, and it comes about when politicians put faith in their own talking points and stubbornly cling to positions that violate the laws of economic logic. The good news is that the country isn't dead yet. Sure, escalating Medicare and Social Security costs spell trouble in the long run, but there's still time to turn the ship. If only someone with a lick of common sense would grab the wheel.

U.S. military forces called to battle in Iraq and Afghanistan have their civilian jobs protected by federal law, but every year the Pentagon reports having to assist personnel who have been illegally fired or demoted during their tours of duty. Of all the employers in the United States who are seemingly ignorant of the law, one stands out: civilian agencies of the federal government. The Washington Post, using a Freedom of Information Act request, revealed in February that during fiscal year 2011, 18 percent of all complaints under the law were filed against federal agencies.
Call me a tightwad, but when I heard that Montreal had rental bikes you can pick up and drop off all over town for a mere $5 Canadian a day (about $4.85 U.S.), it was like angels singing. See the city, sample the local cuisine and work it off without paying usurious day rates at the gym. This I had to try.

Curated by the scholar Scott Simmon, whose wide-ranging selections are smartly sequenced with an eye on big-picture contexts, "Treasures 5" includes a handful of feature films: the Gold Rush-era romance "Salomy Jane" (1914); the hour or so that survives from Gregory La Cava's sharp send-up of Wild West archetypes, "Womanhandled" (1925); and probably the best known work in the set, "Mantrap" (1926), a delightfully subversive vehicle for flapper star Clara Bow (she called it her favorite film), directed by Victor Fleming. But as with the previous "Treasures" sets, the real attractions are the bounty of shorts: narratives, documentaries, newsreels and travelogues, previously unavailable on home video and almost all unseen for decades. (All come with commentary tracks by scholars and experts.)

How the relationships between these three people — wife, lover, husband — play out is one of the things that makes "Deep Blue Sea" so involving.

This is the low end of the drug chain, and Quarles and Duffy try to exploit it to get Givens out of their hair. He easily foils the plan -- outsmarting dopers is child’s play for Givens -- but can’t stop them from turning on each other. These guys would turn on each other for a pill, and when one calls another a “stupid, selfish, oxy-smokin’ gutter (ball),” he’s speaking for everyone.
