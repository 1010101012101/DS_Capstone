Green-flowered plants, specifically zinnias, didn't fare quite as well in our unofficial poll. Some said they weren't worth the trouble, because they tended to disappear into green foliage.

The reasonable expectation is two wins. The necessity is that the Cardnals have to win at least three. The Cardinals might be helped by losing the first game actually. If the Phillies win tonight and Atlanta loses, the Phils clinch the Eastern Division title. They thus will have home field throughout every round of the postseason. Perhaps they'll have a letdown after they win the division.
An entitlement is basically receiving something for nothing. There are countless government programs that are truly entitlement-based: welfare, food stamps, low-income assistance for medical, dental, rent, utility programs, to name just a few. Most recipients of these benefits have never contributed to these programs. They pay no state and federal income taxes because they are “low-income” earners.

øThe second is that different scoring models may have been used for each report. Even though many people think there is just one credit score, there are actually many different models, each with a unique score range.

Sustainability becomes its own academic field: At least nine universities now offer doctoral or master's degrees in urban sustainability studies, and many more programs include the urban environment as a central part of their studies. The shift reflects a coming-of-age of sustainability as a field, away from the back-to-nature ethos of earlier efforts and toward a realization that there are grittier problems -- and solutions. And sustainability programs are also beginning to better reflect the demographics of their students. The New York Times' report

The court hearing comes as presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney is trying to find a way to cut President Barack Obama's strong support among Latino voters. Romney was drawn to the right on issues like immigration as he fought off other Republicans in state GOP primary elections.

Benise's arrangements are also full of wit and surprise. The Spanish version of "Hotel California" is a genuine crowd pleaser, Joaquin Rodrigo's "Concerto Aranjuez" gets a bit of new styling, and the final quintet is a rouser.

During the New Deal days, R.C. became a victim of New Deal legislation. He had effected the sale of his two papers in Ohio in 1931, but according to the terms of settlement he was not to receive all of the proceeds until 1935. By that time FDR had devalued the dollar and nullified the gold clause in all private contracts. As R.C. expressed himself in a private letter to Robert LeFevre, written on February 4, 1964, he "had a little experience" with the government abrogation of contracts whereby "I lost $240,000." It was for this reason, if no other, that he concluded, government should have nothing to do with money or credit.

There is so much uncertainty swirling around the local, state and federal government that building up reserves may seem a no-brainer to most folks. But that probably doesn't hold for drivers in cash-flush cities around California if they are at risk of concussions or whiplash because of street conditions more worthy of a Third World shantytown than 21st-century America. And it probably doesn't hold for parents with kids in any well-heeled school district where class sizes have gone up while student programs have gone down.

On a list of the wealthiest Americans, the GSA's $26 billion annual "income" would place it at No. 4, a billion dollars ahead of -- this is just too delicious -- Charles and David Koch. That's right: What took two of the left's chief irritants a lifetime to amass, the GSA spends every year.

Romney is right when he says that what women really care about is the economy. But he shouldn't get drawn into debating on the terms of an Obama re-election campaign desperate to play demographic small ball and elevate distractions over the big issues: an unaffordable and dubiously constitutional health-care law, an 8.2 percent unemployment rate, a $14 trillion debt.

Since this is the song about the dress (well, actually, there are several about dresses), I'll mention her outfit: she wore a purple gown with gold shoes. It was a neat ensemble.

Jordan: There are a number of expenses that every person is going to have whether they are in college or not.

For instance, 2010-2011 was the first year kindergarteners were required to have a follow-up varicella vaccine for chicken pox, with a single varicella moving from "highly recommended" to "required" only five years before that.

Many patients report that taking omega-3 fatty acids, such as fish oil or flaxseed oil, can help to decrease their symptoms. Blepharitis is not curable; however, the good news is that it can be managed, and people should not have to suffer, because working together with your eye doctor, you can get it under control. Even if your blepharitis is under great control, it can recur years later, and some patients require daily eyedrops or oral antibiotics in order to keep it under control.

By Wall Street standards, $15 million isn't egregious. But Citigroup is a classic example of a raise that attracts attention, says Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of the Value Alliance. Pandit saw his pay jump to $14.9 million in 2011 up from $1 in 2010 and $128,751 in 2009, according to the company's proxy statement.

Boston had a chance to end the series when Rajon Rondo stole Josh Smith's inbounds pass with 10 seconds remaining and raced down the court, looking for the winner.

John Carter himself is less an advertisement for earthly passion than a constant reminder of how desperately the production needed a star in a title role; the buff and handsome Taylor Kitsch gives a flat performance of snoozifying earnestness.

Most of the time though, neither the two leads nor a supporting cast that includes Mark Strong and Dominic West seem to be having any fun. It's as if "John Carter" were a fire pit with plenty of kindling and logs, but no one could find a match.

But inside that room are the names that mean everything to the game. From Jim Thorpe to Joe Greene, from Joe Namath to John Madden, from Dick Butkus to Jim Brown, they all hang out together in immortality.

--The label said "grouper." Inside was catfish. And now a California firm, Seafood Solutions, has to pay $1 million in fines and community service payments for its role in the false labeling of frozen fish fillets. The company was fined $700,000 and ordered to make a community service donation of $300,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

He's right. Everyone saw the Wolverines' limitations. They're one dimensional, devoid of any contingency plans if Burke is denied dribble penetration and the three-point shots aren't falling. But if there's an advantage now that the Big Ten attrition war is finished, it's that unfamiliar teams will be hard-pressed grasping Beilein's intricate offensive scheme in that quick two-day tournament turnover.

There are a few personal differences between the two men, but we're not certain they have much to do with their paths diverging. For example, as we've gotten to know them better, the charm façades have worn thin, and Americans and Californians have gotten a truer view.

Another piece created by Herwig with Brian Evans adapts Jean Michel Basquiat's biography into a dance-theater work. It makes sense that the doomed painter who upended the 1980s art world should have his fleeting life story told through purposefully messy and tumultuous movement. Evans' choreography captures the struggles of a young man overwhelmed by fame and the glare of his own talent. Herwig haunts him as both a deathly figure and as blasé mentor/rival Andy Warhol.

Then there's Ohio's $1 billion tax "rollback" for owner-occupied houses. You and your neighbors -- for that matter, Cleveland Browns owner Randy Lerner and Columbus retailing zillionaire Leslie Wexner -- pay only 87.5 cents of every $1 charged in local property taxes on homes. The remaining 12.5 cents come from "the state" -- us. And though the property-tax rollback is now a budget Frankenstein, any governor who messes with it will be a one-termer.

The point of gamma-gamma tests is to detect casting problems that often occur at the periphery, particularly where rebar congestion occurs.

Ray Ratto, CBSSports.com: "These playoffs have been as much fun as ever, but the cheap shots that started when Shea Weber decided to retaliate for some alleged slight by Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg by ramming his head into the boards, rasslin'-style, haven't stopped. And they haven't stopped because Weber wasn't suspended, and was fined only $2,500, the maximum amount allowed by NHL law. Indeed, the level of punishment meted out by the league's dean of students, Brendan Shanahan, has been as erratic as Marc-Andre Fleury, thus making this solution even more palatable. If head shots really are bad (and we are coming out fully in favor of this postulate), they must be stopped at any cost, and in hockey, the greatest costs are A) Missing the playoffs entirely; and B) getting knocked out of the playoffs. And a team that is suddenly carrying more individual loads because one of their brethren decides to go rogue is going to want to punish the person who increases that workload, or jeopardizes their chances at advancement."

I'll say it: After seven "Harry Potter" movies - and umpteen competing franchises - reconstituted Christ imagery has become a bore.

Any new version of a DREAM Act must not provide additional benefits for those receiving permission to stay, especially no right to sponsor family members who qualify under the current immigration system.

Menzie Chinn writes: China clearly doesn't have an interest in seeing the dollar decline quickly. So I'm certain that -- in part -- explains why the PBOC is tightly managing the yuan's appreciation against the dollar. But even if PBOC and other holders of large dollar reserves don't want the dollar to depreciate rapidly, they also don't want to be the last one out the door. That's why I view the current equilibrium as balanced on a knife's edge. Any decline in the dollar might be enough to prompt some central banks to try to diversify their holdings. The big question will be how China will respond once the dollar decline takes off.
