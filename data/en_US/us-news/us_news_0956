It's interesting that Grabe would lump together the base desires of the public with the supposedly ethical judgment of professional journalists. If by "journalists" she means reporters and so-called news anchors — not commentators and editorial-page opinion columnists — I wonder how many of them would admit to that kind of bias and selective presentation of facts and images. That certainly appears to have been the practice here.

The Chen incident comes at a sensitive time for both countries. Beijing's hopes of a smooth leadership change later this year have been dashed by the March ouster of Bo Xilai from senior posts in the Communist Party. President Barack Obama, facing a re-election campaign, is under pressure from Republicans to take a tougher stance in dealings with China. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Sunday urged the White House to offer protection to Mr. Chen and his family.

1. Kobe Bryant made Denver pay for single coverage. With the unenviable task of choosing whether to throw all of its resources at Bryant or Andrew Bynum, the Nuggets believed that leaving Bryant alone was worth the risk. So Bryant embarrassed them by posting 38 points on 15-of-29 shooting, but there was logic behind Denver's strategy. Bryant had shot only 27.5% through four regular-season games and started Game 1 with a two-for-10 clip. The Nuggets take Bryant's presence seriously, but they were willing to risk Bryant's going off on a scoring tear so long as no one else did.

If someone had told Walters beforehand how much content the project entailed, he would have called it crazy.
"I thought we learned a lot about each other," Camby said. "Guys that are normally quiet and shy really opened up. They really had to talk and show their true feelings. And I think as a whole, we got a better understanding of each other as individuals; not just basketball players, but about guy's upbringings and all the trials and tribulations they had to go through to get to this point. Honestly, I hope that we can do it again at some point during the season."

-- Add some fenders. Bike fenders are your best friend for wet weather riding. Fenders start at around $20, a small price to pay for keeping dry. Unless you're riding a super-light road bike, you probably won't even notice the extra few grams of weight that your fenders add. Plenty of San Francisco cyclists keep fenders on all year.

McCoy threw 45 passes, after he threw 61 before the bye week. Once Peyton Hillis' hamstring injury scrapped the game plan, it was all Air Shurmur all the time.

Dolan's humor is being appreciated for another reason: These are tense times for the Vatican. The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano alluded to it, saying in a front-page editorial this week that Benedict was fighting unnamed, irresponsible "wolves."

In its new location, St. Joseph's continued to flourish under its new name, St. Joseph Medical Center. It established the first 24/7 emergency physicians group in Maryland, was the first community-based hospital in the state licensed to perform open-heart surgery, the first in Maryland to develop a training program in minimally invasive surgical techniques, and was among the first hospitals on the East Coast to offer new mothers the opportunity to labor, deliver and recover in a single room.
The second half continued at the same whiplash speed, with three third-quarter drives going for touchdowns. Gronkowski broke rookie Ryan Kerrigan's attempt at a tackle and padded his record with a 37-yard scoring reception, and David Anderson's first TD catch since 2008 tied the game at 27 on the next drive.

Personally, I'm a big fan of the Internal Revenue Service. If every federal office worked as efficiently and conscientiously as it does, this country would be in far better shape. (That's not saying other agencies with arrest and confiscation powers are bad, I just think the IRS is the best.)
In a healthy economy, the cost of layoffs should be transitory, as workers quickly find new jobs.

Mali has also been battling insecurity in the capital, Bamako. A group of soldiers toppled Mali's democratically elected president in March. The junta leaders then handed power over to an interim government in April, but have not stepped aside. Last week, some soldiers attempted a countercoup, but all the strategic locations they managed to gain control of were quickly recaptured by forces loyal to the junta leader.
1. Kobe Bryant. Finally, the Black Mamba enters a postseason where he's fully healthy and rested. Those lingering knee and ankle issues that hobbled him in the playoffs for the past two years? He took care of that last summer in Germany. That torn ligament in his right wrist he suffered at the beginning of the season? Bryant played through it and it eventually healed. Same with his broken nose and neck pain stemming from whiplash and a concussion he suffered during the All-Star Game.

Three years ago, doctors across the country petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban the sale of cough and cold medicine for infants, medications that had caused scores of deaths from overdose and were of little actual use for symptom relief. After the FDA recommended such a ban, manufacturers quickly responded with a voluntary withdrawal of the medications marketed to children under the age of 2 years. A year later, the withdrawal and labeling changes were expanded to medications for children under the age of 4 years.

A: It used to be more of "whatever works." Now, its carpe diem. Seize the day because you don't know what tomorrow holds. Cherish the people in your life who deserve it. Never forget where you came from and who you are. It only takes a second to smile and lift a heart. And if you find love, don't ever take it for granted. I didn't lose sight of my man's importance in my life, and that sustains me now. Everyone should have a Donald P. Shiley in her life.

But no. In that moment when the functionary at BMW offered me any 3-series I wanted, I succumbed to maximalism. Maximalism is the mostly male mind-set that assumes "more" is better. Spare me your relativism on matters of weight/price/performance/fuel economy. I will not measure out my life in coffee spoons. I want wider tires, bigger brakes, harder suspension, faster windshield wipers. I want the El Presidente, the Venti, the subzero sleeping bag, the full-frame CMOS, the triple-core processor. This is straight out of Thorstein Veblen, the University of Chicago economist who coined the phrase "invidious comparison."
The U.S. attorney in San Francisco, Melinda Haag, and her three counterparts in the state said in October that they would aggressively prosecute many marijuana dispensaries as profit-making criminal enterprises.

No wonder President Obama constantly insists that switching to vastly more expensive and less-efficient energy sources will create jobs.

A pair of serpentine lions, for example, prepare to claw one another during a midair death leap toward each other. A construction worker with a blowtorch applies spurts of heat to a white, masked face that is otherwise bodiless. A tower composed of arms, guns, knives and ropes ascends the sky. And, in one of the exhibit's more impressive but dire-looking works, a woman holding a baby is surrounded by demonic figures and ghastly skeletons endowed with wings. She looks as if she's about to enter the gates of a grim underworld.

Senate lawmakers also voted 27-5 to pass a bill that would give people with certain criminal convictions the right to own guns again, provided those rights were restored by court order.

Music - I think that it is fairly safe to say that 2011 was pretty much owned by the booming voice of English songstress Adele. While Adele's music is impressive enough on its own, I think she is remarkable for shattering the hard and fast rule of the past 30 years that a woman has to be a size zero, blonde or occasionally shoot fireworks out of various body parts to be a pop star.

Immigration: Favors U.S.-Mexico border fence, opposes education benefits to illegal immigrants. Opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college, but would do so for those who serve in the armed forces. Establish an immigration-status verification system for employers and punish them if they hire non-citizens who do not prove their legal status. Proposes more visas for holders of advanced degrees in math, science and engineering who have U.S. job offers, and would award permanent residency to foreign students who graduate from U.S. schools with a degree in those fields.

Liberty is upgrading its automated snowmaking capabilities; and the Eastwind, Upper Strata, Vertigo and Blue Streak trails have already seen some of the improvement that a million dollars will bring.

They turned to children from the British Environmental-Risk Study, which tracked 1,116 sets of same-sex twins born in 1994 and 1995. All of the children provided cells through cheek swabs when they were 5 and 10 years old, but because it was too costly to measure telomeres in all of the children, the Duke researchers focused on a subset of identical twins who lived near London, including many with teenage mothers.

I think Sacco got a lot of help from his GM, Greg Sherman, at the deadline -- and it's still possible, if they don't make the playoffs, that management might think something like "Hey, with the pieces we got, we should have gotten in no matter what."

It's a noble idea, but most of L.A. is too spread out for such nonsense. Walking around just might work, however, in the 1 percent of Los Angeles that constitutes its historic downtown.

(On the wide receiving core being scrutinized and reaffirming why they made the decision with what they have)- "Going into the season, I didn't think we had a fair enough evaluation of the receiver core based off last year's games. They were not emphasized very much, it was the structure of the offense, they weren't the focus necessarily. I said do we really know who we have first of all? We had a strategy in the offseason to deal with and use our money for extensions for five or six players, you guys have followed that and we were able to get that done for the most part. We also went in with the idea that there we a couple free agents that we were going to extend ourselves to in that first wave and we lost out on one and then after that we were going to go approach free agency a different way. We drafted Greg Little and thought he could help us right away. We like our receivers, but again, they're all kind of young. It's a young group and if they can mature together, this is our hope, then we'll have something going. They're learning a new offense, they're learning we're not at the playground where you just go out and throw me a long one, they have to be very precise in this offense and so it's going to take some time, but I kind of like our group. I think they're okay. They're big guys for the most part, Jordan Norwood's not so big, but most of them are pretty big guys and that's what you need in this system and now we just have to get them the ball, sustain drives and those types of things and I think we'll be okay."

The point is, when Stoudemire is on the floor, the defense just can’t zero in on Anthony and load up against him, as the Heat did in the fourth quarter.

Landry Fields made one of two shots, Tyson Chandler made one of one, Iman Shumpert missed his only attempt, J.R. Smith missed four of five shots, Jared Jeffries missed his only attempt and Steve Novak made his only attempt.

If Gov. Ritter is going to use the Catholic faith as a launching platform to attack critics of Compañeros, perhaps he should look to his own public record. Ensuring continued Planned Parenthood funding, supporting abortions in cases of rape, incest and "fetal anomalies," removing conscience protections from pharmacists, and expanding "rights" to practicing homosexuals all act in direct contradiction with the very same Catholic faith he uses to express his outrage.

ø- Apple offers other options beyond audio sync. The first is the Timecode feature only offered in the most expensive pro cameras that generates numbers directly into the video file. Option two is to use the time settings in your cameras. Make sure, for instance, it's set to the correct date and time, and have all the cameras time coded that way. Another good option is to clap your hands at the beginning of the scene, to resemble the Hollywood "clapper" who uses the clapboard as a visual cue for editors to line up the different scenes. In the software, make a visual marker (hit M on the keyboard) on each clip by the clap, and line them up that way.

Oh, it's a mirror all right, but it doesn't reflect the people it was meant to harpoon. Instead it reveals far more about those who still think it's clever to ridicule the roughly 10 percent of Americans who believe this nonsense.

A brilliant adolescent who's already attending college, Susan Falls narrates untrustworthily, moving between her experience and her narrated daydreams. "The shaking of her body, rather than being expressed by the words my body is shaking, seems to be the expression of the words my body is shaking," she thinks. She's moved into the meta, questioning whether she's an actor whose story is being narrated, or whether the words of the story itself are acting upon her. Add a section in which Susan makes notes that appear in the story's margins, two versions of Susan running parallel on the page, and the story is the collection's most formally inventive with a serpent's-tail ending. It's also one of the stories that casually dips into sex and drugs — Susan has her eye on a woman in her class — giving the headiness a physical counterpoint.

Politically, though, it's important. As long as a sufficient balance exists in the fund, Social Security is legally authorized to pay whatever Congress defines as full benefits. If the balance falls below what's needed, the program can only pay what it receives from the payroll tax.

Nor do recipients receive money they paid in when they were working, contrary to what some believe. They receive money from today's workers.

Most judges are appointed by the governor to fill vacancies left by those who retired or otherwise left office before the end of one of their six-year terms. Incumbents then come before voters to be elected for another six years, at least in theory. If no candidate challenges a sitting judge who is up for reelection, the incumbent wins automatically and his or her name does not even go on the ballot. That is why voters in Los Angeles County do not see 150 judicial offices on their ballots every two years, and thank goodness.

Step Four: Think big. Delegates and senators ought to understand that no matter what they decide, some voters won't be happy. If tough medicine must be swallowed, better to take a heaping spoonful now and not be forced to take some more again next year, or the year after, or the year after that. That means such important matters as the gas tax (to finance future transportation projects) and flush tax (to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay) ought not be shoved aside simply because neither helps balance next year's general fund budget.

Most affecting throwback: Rapper 50 Cent, who performed "Get Rich or Die Tryin'," the 2003 album that made him a star, in its entirety, with an assist from his friend Eminem. "Get Rich" is not a short album -- it's eighteen songs long, which gave the emcee an opportunity to flex his underrated emotional range. 50 was funny, glowering, inspiring, and, at times, more than a little bit cranky that the style of high-octane, hi-sheen NYC gangsta rap that he represents has gone so far out of style. His showcase was a reminder of how exciting it could be. Of course, 50 was partially responsible for running it into the ground by flooding the market with discs by his less talented G-Unit buddies, but still, it was tough not to root for him and get a little nostalgic about his heyday. He's the last New York area rapper to make himself a major player. No, Nicki Minaj doesn't count; at least not yet. We'll see how the new album does.

The trouble with battlefields, 150 years after the fact, is that they are so pretty, like the green and peaceful farm fields they once were and, in Boonville's case, still are.

The Office of Administration is typically not an agency that runs programs, she said.

It's time to let the selectee list think for itself. With technological innovation, the list could be transformed into a "smart" anti-terrorism tool: Allegedly dangerous individuals would be added, but additional passenger screening is triggered only when an algorithm connects potential attackers to a suspect travel itinerary and during periods of elevated, if vague, threat levels. Individuals selected for additional screening must be shared with the airlines.

The challenges are not unique to John Martin, but remain present throughout eastern and southeastern Colorado, with the recently depleted Bonny Reservoir along the Republican River serving as testimony.

Whether looked at through the lens of geography, race or income, the range of scores is stark. What makes matters worse is the fact that the HSPA, seen as an assessment of student readiness for life beyond high school, of skills and of what students “learned” in school, is an absolute fraud and an abject failure in meeting its putative objectives. Simply put, we need to scrap the assessment, salvage what we can and design one that shows kids are prepared for life beyond high school.

Spain's scope for retaliation is limited, said those familiar with bilateral trade. While its $1.41 trillion economy is four times the size of Argentina's and Spain is one of Argentina's top 10 trading partners, Argentina does more trade with Brazil and China.

The Nobel-winning Austrian economist, F.A. Hayek, is enjoying a popular revival thanks in no small part to the big-government designs of President Barack Obama. Although Hayek's "The Road to Serfdom" is his best-known book, it isn't his most important. That would be "The Constitution of Liberty."

The only thing I hate about the holidays is when they’re over. Well, that and the insane crowds everywhere. Other than fighting traffic and being unable to find parking at the mall, this is my favorite time of year. I love getting holiday cards (especially if there are pictures), shopping, baking, eating, pictures with Santa, and spending time with family. Starting right after Thanksgiving, my husband and I work our way through all of our Christmas movies after the kids are in bed. Hot chocolate, a movie and the Christmas tree twinkling in the background makes me giddy.

The onion soup at Cafe de La Presse may be hard to beat, but I'd find it difficult to choose it over the version at Garcon ($6.50).

Davis secured the victory when McDonald ended his wild day by hitting into a game-ending double play.
