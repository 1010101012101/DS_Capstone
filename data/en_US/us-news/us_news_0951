53: Bennett’s completion percentage. He has a live arm but so far has completed just 53 percent of his passes, quite low, especially in an offense that relies heavily on screens and quick passes. Bennett very well could develop into a great passer but he’s not there yet and it might be difficult to expect him to turn the corner in this area at Washington, at Stanford and against USC. Thomas has completed 61.5 percent of his passes over the last two seasons and has 557 attempts under his belt.

Certainly, you can understand why airlines would want to be stingy with miles used for non-travel purposes. One way or another, they have to pay when they award something they themselves don't provide. I doubt, however, that they pay anyone "full retail" for non-travel awards. In some cases, they may well trade benefits, and I know that airlines often buy some outside services, such as advertising, with tickets rather than cash.

“When doctors are dispirited, the care they give to patients is worse,” said Farr Curlin, co-director of the Program on Medicine and Religion. “Patients should be very hopeful that their doctor sees their work as a remarkable privilege, even a holy privilege, that will make the doctor respond to that patient out of joy.”
The emphasis on this couple is just one of the ways director Daniel Sullivan (who helmed "Twelfth Night" at the Delacorte last year) steered this "Merchant" on a kinder, gentler path. He's sanded out the play's more unsavory edges, but they're precisely what gives this controversial work its often cruel depths. You lose some, you lose some.

A clean, well-lighted place for a glass of wine and a quick bite isn't exactly a common sight around Lombard Street. It's what Melissa Gisler, entranced by the local enotecas during a stint at cooking school in Rome, wanted to bring home to her longtime Cow Hollow neighborhood. The result was Ottimista, which opened in 2005, merging a Marina vibe with the basic pleasures of an Italian wine bar. "I'm done with the bar scene," says Gisler, "and I felt like a lot of my friends in their early 30s were, too." Ottimista means "optimist" in Italian, a reflection of the breezy, pan-Italian approach to the menu and wine list. It's one that surely will resonate with Gisler's neighbors, even if the buzzy weekend crowd keeps the "bar" in "wine bar."

Manningham. Tremendous catch. No doubt about it. We’ll be talking about that one forever. … However, the ball he caught out of bounds because, as Cris Collinsworth accurately noted, he drifted too closely to the sideline was a huge mistake. He’s battled such issues in the past and it’s the finer points of his route running that have driven Manning and the Giants nuts in the past. He’s been better recently, no doubt, but he’s still a bit undisciplined in his routes at times. I honestly believe that’ll be a part of why the Giants won’t give him the huge money he probably will demand. Will another team give it to him? Maybe. As I said to someone in the press box, his 38-yard catch to spark the game-winning drive is why he’ll get paid; the miscommunication between him and Manning on the next play is why it won’t be the Giants who pay him. But that’s just an uneducated guess from me. For now, Manningham deserves all the kudos for that huge grab.

It ships with Android 3.2 but it'll will receive the Ice Cream treatment by springtime. Price: just $329, albeit with just 8 gigabytes of storage. Will this approach work? Maybe, if Acer (and other companies trying to undercut the $499 iPad) tries harder to tempt away potential purchasers of netbooks instead of iPads.
The Rock Beyond Belief event at Fort Bragg, organized by soldiers here two years after an evangelical Christian event at the eastern North Carolina post, is the most visible sign so far of a growing desire by military personnel with atheist or other secular beliefs to get the same recognition as their religious counterparts.

"We started off as a joke," Sturdivant said. "I was looking through the paper and saw Puffy Ami Yumi. I thought that was cool. We'll just be called Puffy Areolas. The only regret is when I talk to my mom about it. When she tells all of her friends, she's embarrassed about it. Other than that, I have no regrets."

Filmmaker Ian Palmer spent more than a decade collecting images of raw street fights, mostly between the Irish tribes the Quinn McDonaghs and the Joyces. A couple of Joyce boys wound up dead after mixing it up with the Quinn McDonaghs, and starting in the 1990s each side began circulating insulting videos that served as fight kindling. Both sides call themselves “travelers,” sometimes known as Irish gypsies, a subculture given fictional treatment in the Guy Ritchie film “Snatch,” in which Brad Pitt played a traveler.
VTA officials also hope that the project will be in the running for about $200 million in state bonds approved by voters last month. Burns said he was optimistic but added the VTA "could get all of that amount or none."

Another slam-bang action picture from the bullet-headed Jason Statham. Director Boaz Yakin has some style, and the stripped-down, just-the-fights-ma'm approach makes for an entertaining if somewhat silly hour and a half. (Newark Star-Ledger)
Earlier last week, California State University announced that it will freeze most admissions for spring 2013, with the exception of a few hundred community college transfer students who will be offered admission to eight of Cal State's 23 campuses.
HOUSTON – There was a hit that fell just a couple feet in front of on-rushing left fielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis. There was an R.A. Dickey pitch that didn't quite make its last dip. There was a smash that was just out of the reach of reliever Manny Acosta. All were short distances, but when they were added together they were enough to push the Astros past the Mets, 4-3, Monday night at Minute Maid Park.
The Blues still don't know when they're playing - though it's worse for the Kings, who don't know when they're packing their bags and coming east - and it may be at least another day until the schedule is announced.

Talent. The town was alive with it Sunday. The long-awaited "42nd Street" opened at the Golden Gate Theater, and it should be the toughest ticket in town. Any musical that includes "You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me" has to be among the best, and this is even better: fast, funny and filled with showgirls. You get your money's worth and more, the plus being one of the great pit bands, with an old-timey drummer who doesn't miss a rim shot or a cymbal crash.

The biggest change we'd like to see is the standardization of our industry. We need to get to a "plug and play" environment where systems and applications from different sources work nicely together. The standards now are all different for too many different systems, and we need common standards for all of our equipment. Making changes in a security system should be a seamless process, but that's still a challenge sometimes.

Board member Ruth Adkins most strongly urged that the board should redraw boundaries this year, over the objections of area parents, in order to provide the best quality of education to Alameda and Sabin students. She noted some irony in that, since it was her own activism as a parent trying to fight the district's efforts to close her neighborhood school that led her to run for school board.
"You've got restaurants that had 'We support the ILWU' right in their front window," Sprague said. "You'd have supporters saying they won't eat anywhere else, and you'd have other people say, 'I'm not going to go there.' You had people taking sides, and that just creates tension."

Nine points separated the third- and eighth-seeded teams in the West last season and that close finish could happen again. The Sharks have the most talent but acquiring Dany Heatley didn't raise their guts quotient. Vancouver is built around stellar goalie Roberto Luongo, who's likely to share time with New Jersey's Martin Brodeur in net for Canada in the Winter Olympics and bear the hopes of a nation on his well-padded shoulders.

I spent more than 30 years in the airline industry and much of it as an executive at Continental Airlines. For many of those years I competed against Southwest Airlines and know well the effect they have on fares when they enter a market. Fares go down and the market expands as more people can afford to take a trip. The incumbent airline on the route usually matches the Southwest fare and their traffic also expands, albeit at a lower profit margin. And that is why United does not want the competition.

It’s Daft Punk’s name on the disc, and that’s going to sell records to Euro-house music fans worldwide who recognize the French duo as their Beatles. But the soundtrack to “TRON: Legacy,” the sequel to the often pilloried, semirehabilitated early-’80s virtual reality flick, is at least as much the work of orchestra conductor Joseph Trapanese.

Last month, the Illinois House passed a bill that would allow admission fees to be imposed at 324 state-owned natural sites, including all 122 state parks. The bill is now in the Senate, which has wisely amended it to allow the fee only on each car rather than on each of the 40 million to 45 million visitors to the parks each year. We hope the Senate version, which would raise $7 million to $8 million a year, is approved and goes to Gov. Pat Quinn, who supports it. The state parks need the money.
I said some things to the man in uncensored language I probably shouldn't have used. I told him that I didn't appreciate him being a liar and taking me for a fool.
A few unfortunate people have genetic tendency for sleep and sleeplike events to intrude into their wakefulness. This tendency gives them a disease known as narcolepsy. But narcolepsy sufferers, unlike you, usually feel refreshed after taking a nap. Another group of people are too sleepy during the day for no clear reason, and no matter how long they've slept. This disorder is called idiopathic hypersomnia.
As schools move to the longer day, Brizard hopes giving principals more discretionary dollars will give them greater autonomy.

A: I’m not sure it was resistance. We felt if it was an anomaly, that eventually scores would begin to fluctuate up and down. In organizations like schools, and I have run several, people change, teachers come and go, principals come and go ... . At some point, if this was something that was a conspiracy to cheat, someone would be telling. You can’t keep a secret with 3,600 teachers, I don’t think.

In addition to efforts in Congress to cut CPB's budget, state legislatures in several states -- such as Rhode Island, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- are discussing the removal of state dollars that subsidize public broadcasting. The amount of money from both federal and state coffers that goes into public broadcasting is relatively low (CPB receives about $500 million a year), but when budgets get squeezed, such expenses seem like a luxury.

I believe in our Lord Jesus Christ because he died for me and my sins. Would you come to his defense in a crowd if everyone there was mocking Christianity? Or would you hide your real feelings with a false face? Paul tells us that everything is naked in God's sight. David writes in Psalms 139 "Oh Lord you have searched me and known me. You know my sitting down and my rising up." He also tells us further in this Psalms that the Lord is acquainted with all David's ways. So you see you may wear a mask in front of friends but the Lord knows the words on the end of your tongue.

In the realm of contemporary art, the Winfield Gallery appears to specialize in nothing in particular, which makes it fascinating to visit. Out of a great jumble of stuff in the gallery popped some remarkable things: sculptures by Stephen De Staebler and Jack Zajac, a little gem of abstract expressionism by John Saccaro (1913-81) and raku sculptures by Karen Shapiro that included prescription pills the size of throw pillows.

"For what we did, you don't get paid. That's not going to work for most people," Kasdan said. But there were compensations to making a low-budget labor of love. "I can't wait to have another experience like that because it was really satisfying and fun. You have people like Wiest and Keaton coming for nothing and throwing everything they've got your way, saying, 'How can I help?'" "Winter's Bone" cinematographer Michael McDonough shot the film, and Meg Kasdan was at his side throughout the production. "You can't ask for anything more than that," he said. "Except being paid. But I didn't have any other option. How can you turn your back on an opportunity like that?
"It was very inspiring for us to have him out there," point guard Baron Davis said, but noted that it was clear the "warrior" and "vocal leader" wasn't his usual self.

He was really focusing on trying to get through the game and give what he had."

Robert Hanssen was arrested on Feb. 18, 2001, bringing to a close his 22-year career spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia while he was a special agent of the FBI. During that time he revealed some of our most sensitive national security secrets, costing lives and American taxpayers perhaps billions of dollars. Other security breaches could not be attributed to Hanssen or any known spy before him. The inescapable conclusion: There was another mole. And that was 11 years ago.
California has the 46th lowest Medicaid reimbursement rate in the country, mainly because the federal government bases its rates on average income levels rather than the number of poor people in the state. That means relatively few doctors will see Medi-Cal patients, and many enrollees wind up in emergency rooms because they weren't able to see a physician in time.

With his wife, Callista, in her usual place at his side, her mauve jacket perfectly matching her nail polish, he acknowledged that she was correct in telling him that his proposal for a moon colony "was probably not my most clever comment in this campaign. I thought, frankly, in my role of providing material for 'Saturday Night Live,' it was helpful."

Fredy Montero – The young Colombian forward was a popular choice among those forecasting the 2012 golden boot and league MVP races. If he’s going to make a dent, he has some catch-up work to do. Montero has yet to score in six games this season – two in CONCACAF Champions League play and four in MLS. Rosales’ absence hasn’t helped, but elite players are supposed to find ways to adapt. The pressure will be on Montero, who scored 12 goals last season, to get back on track vs. Colorado on Saturday.

-- I don't know if this can be construed as political, but email going back and forth in Jersey City this week seems to indicate that local Mercedes-Benz owners are nervous that carjacking incidents seem to concentrate on the German vehicles -- and not Volkswagens.

Even C-class Benz owners would be welcome, I presume.

But most incumbents run unopposed and the "race" for their office never makes the ballot. Of those judges who retire, a fair number do so in the middle of their terms, which allows the governor to appoint a successor. In any given election, fewer than 10 seats might actually go before voters.

The Star-Ledger used salary data of certified teachers from the New Jersey Department of Education’s 2008-09 school year, the most recent figures available. The analysis is based purely on how much classroom teachers are paid for their work period (which, for most, is 10 months). It does not include benefits such as health care and pension. The figures also do not include extra pay that teachers may get for coaching sports teams or running school clubs or other activities.

Upper West Side of New York City: Too many visitors waste their time around Times Square. The real New York is in Greenwich Village or Soho or Lexington Avenue.

As we pulled past the point of another island, distinguished from the other 9,999 islands solely by my navigational theory, the wind stopped. The clouds parted. The sun emerged, backed by God's own depth of blue. And there in front of us was a clear channel through the mangroves. The water lay flat as a reflecting pond as we cut straight furrows through it. A brown shadow in the green water ahead grew larger as it closed on the point of my bow, then broke in a graceful gull wing of a flipper about 2 feet from tip to tip.
The parade route has changed several times over the years. Originally, units marched south from First Street into the heart of the business district, then the route was reversed, and now with El Camino Real narrowed by landscaping, they march east from Pacific on Main Street, north on C Street to First, turn east, then north onto Prospect, disbanding at Columbus Tustin Park.

The moves fulfill what has long been a goal for the Yankees — improving their starting rotation. Pineda, 22, went 9-10 with a 3.74 while establishing himself as one of the top young arms in the game. He made the American League All-Star team as a rookie before fading in the second half.
I won't get into the pros and cons of premium support either, other than to note that The Times' editorial board has praised the version proposed by Ryan with Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)

Chinese-based activists say Chen was driven away by supporters and then handed over to others who brought him to Beijing.
Q: Hey, Tony: I am not sure about Colt McCoy, but this is what I think: No QB will last with the talent on the offense. So here is my idea. First round: draft Trent Richardson, the best WR available, and then the best offensive lineman available. (No more second-round WR). Give Colt one more year and if not good enough, draft QB in first round the following year. They say it takes three years for a WR to develop. That would give Greg Little and the new WR time and then you no longer have the "no talent" excuse. If Colt doesn't work then you get a new QB with some weapons. Your thoughts? -- Mike Hughes, Dallas, Ga.

Two of the fundamental attributes of good journalism are curiosity and a respect for the people on whom you report. Burnett got an "F" on both those counts with her Occupy Wall Street piece. Not only didn't she listen hard enough to learn anything from the people in the group, she and her producers positioned the speakers to be seen as objects of derision. That is deplorable.

"That's something we've discussed in terms of going back to Evan; he allows some roster flexibility," Emery said. "He still has to make the team even though we drafted him, but if he's in that H-back role, we may not have to carry an extra fullback."
The Yankees prevailed, completing a series sweep and evening their 2012 record at 3-3, because Nick Swisher crushed a two-out, two-run homer off Kevin Gregg in the top of the 10th inning. That would be the Swisher who has been one of the Yankees’ steadiest regular-season players the last three years, but also one of their worst in the postseason. And a player who also has carried the label, fairly or unfairly, of being unable to hit in the clutch, and who has personified a lineup that kicked off this season failing repeatedly with runners in scoring position.

Letter writer William Ermatinger of Parkton ("In deficit morass, voters have themselves to blame," Aug 2) singled out "very conservative" Rep. Andy Harris in performing as his electorate would have in voting no on the debt ceiling legislation. I assume you are against Mr. Harris because he didn't compromise on his principle for a cut in actual spending and not only a reduction in the amount by which spending will be increased, as evidenced by his no vote on the debt ceiling legislation. If the no vote is evidence of unwilling compromisers, why didn't you identify the very liberal Democrats from the 3rd, 4th and 5th Congressional Districts who also voted no?

In his third major league start, Hutchison went six innings, allowing seven hits and six runs (five earned)( in a no-decision. He said he was pleased that manager John Farrell stayed with him after a five-run second inning. "It obviously gives you confidence," Hutchison said, "but I'm very confident in my abilities and I expected to go out there after that inning and keep it right where it was and try to go deep in the game and save the bullpen."

And the public at large wonders what could have possibly motivated the young man accused of the killings to strike out so violently against four middle-aged men who called the streets their home. Ocampo could not find work after being discharged from the Marines in 2008, and his father has been homeless for several months.
The bitterness of losing to Not That Ohio will linger in the program for a while. But this was still Michigan's best season in at least 18 years.
Kevin Martin kept Sacramento close by scoring 35 in that contest, but his status for this game is in question because of his latest ankle injury. Martin didn't play the final 15 minutes in the Kings' 99-98 loss to Oklahoma City on Tuesday.
"When we saw the compound where the brothers lived, we were shocked by what we saw — an extraordinarily unique compound," an official said.
Chad Diehl, Clemson, FB: One of two fullbacks signed after the draft, Diehl has good size (6-foot-1, 257 pounds) for the position, and he also has the requisite mentality. He loves contact and taking on defenders as a straight-ahead blocker. However, he’s one dimensional, having gotten just six carries in his college career and catching just seven passes. Vonta Leach is obviously entrenched as the Ravens’ fullback, and the team doesn’t figure to carry another one on the roster during the regular season.

"He's a good player," Colletti said. "There's never been a question about that. It's good to see his knee has recovered from the surgery. … When a player's hurt, you never know how it affects them — their physical well-being and their confidence. It looks like he feels great."

One big omission in this 2:24-hour musical biography is Marley explaining his own creative process. There are many interviews, but reporters of the day were caught up in his hair, his history, his religion and his marijuana use and never nailed down much about where the poetry came from. We hear how he worked out melodies, how he incorporated topicality into his lyrics, but not how he wrote the anthemic "One Love," how he thought of "Stir It Up" or "I Shot the Sheriff."
With the dollar in free fall, fresh truffles probably won't be on many holiday tables this year, but truffled cheeses remain relatively affordable. One of the better ones in this crowded category is Sottocenere (about $25 a pound), a cow's milk cheese from Italy's Veneto region with a gray ash coating, black truffle in the interior and truffle oil rubbed on the rind. To my taste, it's overly aromatic for the cheese board but would be sublime in a Christmas morning omelet, melted over polenta or stirred into a sophisticated macaroni and cheese. Accompany with Champagne or Pinot Noir.
In any case, Judge Clay Smith sided with Callahan and ordered Jaramillo's deposition to go forward today - one day before he was scheduled to present himself to the Fullerton Hotel and Spa for eight months of pampering. This issue is far from over, though, because Don Haidl is still fighting to keep himself from being deposed and from turning over the Haidl case files to Cavallo - all on the same Fifth Amendment grounds. A hearing on those issues is scheduled next week.
The second thing is I think I've been able to bring some perspective of America's long journey for a multiethnic democracy that works. From the time of our founding, where we clearly had a birth defect called slavery, to now when you've had two African American secretaries of state and one white woman. And I can bring that perspective to struggling democracies or to places where multiethnic democracy isn't really working, or places where racial issues have been sort of pushed under the rug.
The Cubs obviously believe that Epstein, 37, can break the many curses in Chicago, whether it be the Billy Goat, the black cat, or Bartman. To attain success, Epstein must also break the Cardinals' firm hold on the NL Central.

McMillan said Scott knew what he was in for when he signed with the Cavaliers. When it was pointed out that LeBron James had not yet decided to sign with the Heat when Scott was hired, and some thought James might still return, McMillan said Scott surely realized that the odds were long.
Most of the gain was driven by a surge in volatile apartment construction. That could help create jobs and boost economic growth, but it doesn't signal a comeback for the depressed housing market.

The Secret Service declined comment.
These young musicians create fun-loving, three-minute slices of tunes that are heavily reminiscent of the psychedelic era’s garage rock sound. At first listen, one might think this is a reissue, but the band members, born long after the ’60s, love the low-tech vibe of the era: the powerful beat of a simple drum kit, the trebly bleats of a Farfisa organ, the raw, twangy sound of an electric guitar and the punchy bursts of that era’s soul brass sections.
“History is very much alive there,” said Taylan, 34, of Hyde Park in New York’s Hudson Valley.
With 4:09 to play, Portland’s Brad Ross was called for slashing and Joe Morrow drew a minor penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and a 10-minute misconduct. The Blazers came away with a two-man advantage, but continued to misfire.

Then you have to examine what people like Paul McKee and McEagle Properties have proposed. It's easy to find reasons not to like their planned development. You may object to their high-handed treatment of people living on the North Side. Perhaps you dislike the almost inevitable gentrification the project will bring. Perhaps it's the vagueness of the plan that irritates you. Perhaps, like my friend, you think McEagle's scheme will not result in "regeneration," but rather displacement.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations tests have caused two Volt batteries to catch fire days after the crash and a third to start smoking and emitting sparks. First, NHTSA said early this month that a Volt had caught fire three weeks after a crash test, a problem GM said could be avoided if NHTSA were to drain the battery after the test. The safety agency then tested three other Volt batteries this month. One of those batteries started smoking and sparking, and a second battery caught fire a week after the test.

The filmmakers have populated the commune with an eccentric cast of characters led by a bearded, dreadlocked guru/hot guy named Seth (Justin Theroux), who immediately sets his sights on Linda. Better known around town for his writing ("Iron Man 2," "Tropic Thunder") than acting, Theroux is so perfect in his enlightened perfection here that it's hard not to applaud the fact that someone finally found the right way to put him center stage.

Point is, it didn't take long, did it? The frustration was palpable in the waning moments of the Blazers season.

That's what needs to happen in California: The people's business needs to get on the ballot. Fishkin is promoting the idea of regularly convening a citizens advisory council, whose proposals would automatically or easily go on the state ballot.
