For a wildlife fix, we drive south out of Girdwood to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center. Journeying along the Turnagain Arm, with its 30-foot tides and vast tidal flats, we marvel at the sublime meeting of mountains and water. At certain times of the year, 6 -to 10-foot-tall bore tides advance through the arm, sometimes ridden by loony surfers and harbor seals. The center is located near Portage, in an area all but denuded of trees when a salt-water intrusion caused by the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964 killed most of the forest.

Last week, North Carolina became the 30th state to ban gay marriage in its state Constitution. In six states and the District of Columbia where same-sex marriage is recognized, courts or legislators changed the law. But every time a state's voters have had an opportunity to vote on same-sex marriage, they have voted to ban it, not legalize it. Voters in this very blue state of California passed a law restricting marriage to one man and one woman with 52 percent of the vote in 2008.
Indeed, that wellspring of ego was at the root of everything. It compelled Chamberlain to share that factoid about his 20,000 sexual conquests. It was the arrogance that made him believe he could fight Muhammad Ali. The iconoclasm that made him thumb his nose at civil-rights giants and support Nixon in 1968. The hedonism that allowed him to own a bedspread made of the fur from 17,000 noses of Arctic wolves. The confidence that made him consider an NBA comeback at 49. The magisterial presence that compelled him to dominate every game, encounter, room, arena, conflict, discussion, card game, competition and conversation he ever took part in.

Obama isn't wrong to stress the urgency of improving U.S. education. America's scandal, unlike South Korea's, is the number of poor and minority children consigned to dropout-factory school systems that hollow the promise of class mobility.

He’s a bit of a stretch here and this spot could just as easily go to Jonathan Martin from Stanford as well. Simply: There are a lot of things that would be nice for the Bills here — a true No. 2 wideout if either Blackmon or Floyd falls, a corner if Gilmore drops. But the fact is that Buffalo has a shot at a solid left tackle and they need to take it. Don’t be surprised it Dallas trades up here to get Mark Barron, allowing Reiff/Martin to fall to them.
Grade – 3.5: Oregon has enough athletes at defensive end to believe that this group will be able to fly around and make plays while remaining fresh. It’s imperative, however, that the Ducks find two inside players who can control the middle like Bair and Clark did in 2010. Otherwise, with the team already facing the task of replacing linebackers Casey Matthews and Spencer Paysinger (see tomorrow's breakdown), the Ducks could see teams slow down games with strong inside running games.

Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Chief Administrative Officer Miguel Santana are putting the final touches on the budget that the mayor will introduce to the City Council on Friday. All signs are that it will open a bruising debate, with the predictable calls for sacrifice to close a budget shortfall of more than $200 million. Layoffs seem a near-certainty, and the search for new revenue is an inescapable part of the solution.

I decided that an aggressive cancer needed aggressive action. I called my primary care physician the day after Christmas. Since I was pretty sure it was a squamous cell carcinoma, I asked for an immediate referral to a dermatologist without visiting my primary care physician.
The history of Baltimore is seen through its unique sights. As the city of Baltimore appraises and decides the disposition of its historic properties, it should remember that part of their value is tourism dollars and their significant cultural heritage to the Baltimore and all of Maryland. The West Baltimore neighborhood surrounding the Mencken House has numerous sights to intrigue visitors, including the Irish Shrine Museum, the B&O Roundhouse (aka the railroad museum) Mount Clare Mansion in Carroll Park, the Hollins Market (Baltimore's first public market, still operating), the Edgar Allan Poe House, and the Enoch Pratt "old No. 2" Library — the library branch that H.L. Mencken cited as a major influence on his education. These locations are cornerstones of Baltimore's past. Visiting them enriches a tourist's experience and showcases our city's important history.

So that when you come to a place that not only thinks it has a destiny, but knows it has a destiny, you cannot but be arrested. Where this place is headed is to be the leader in commerce, art, citrus production, music, rabbit breeding, oil production, furniture manufacture, walnut growing, literature, olive bottling, short- and long-distance hauling, clay modelling, msthetic criticism, fish export, canary-bird culture, playwrighting, shipping, cinematic creativeness, and drawing-room manners. In short, it is going to be a paradise on earth. And, with such vaulting ambitions, it might pull off something: you can't tell. It is keenly aware of the Orient, and also of Mexico; streams are meeting here that ought to churn up some exciting whirlpools. I, personally, even if the first act hasn't been so hot, am not going to walk out on the show. One thing it is going to be, within the twelve-month, is the wine center of the New World. I guess you think I'm going to walk out on that, do you? That will make a lot of things different.
That is the best-case scenario.
Those findings may sound strange, but they’re in line with another study of Danish births. The researchers said this can probably be traced (in part) to women using Clomid on their own, outside of fertility clinic care.

Notes: The Timbers acquired forward Mike Fucito from Montreal on Friday. Fucito had appeared in one game with the Impact after coming to the team from Seattle in a trade Feb. 17.

Mondo says the show has proved to him what he's capable of achieving and has contributed to his growth as a person and an artist. Gretchen says she needed this "so bad" in so many different ways. Michael tells her she has grown as a designer while staying true to herself. Nina says "I have all faith you can be a star." Gretchen's mother and sister come out on the runway for hugs, as does Tim. Gretchen says her stuff is in storage, and "I have no idea where I'm going," but that the money from the win -- $100,000 -- will definitely help.

It is safe to say at this point that neither team will make a run at the Big East title. So now it’s a case of positioning for a better bowl — though both teams are more concerned at the moment with simply finding a way to win again. USF has lost three straight since its 4-0 start and is winless in Big East play. With Miami, Louisville and West Virginia left, the Bulls may need a win here to avoid a disappointing sub-.500 season. Rutgers, which has lost two straight since opening 5-1, will get to six wins, and probably seven, but can the Knights get to eight or nine? The latter may be the only chance this team has to escape the Pinstripe Bowl.

In the end, Bird's concerns -- along with the testimony by several dozen other opponents -- didn't matter. City Council members passed the sidewalk law Thursday. But in this age when most policy disputes lead to personal attacks -- from both conservatives and liberals -- it's important for reasonable people to disagree reasonably. If only more of us thought like that, we might have an easier time finding real solutions to complicated problems.
I'm not sure if the fact that “Jenga” is now a viable gaming experience is a good or bad thing. On one hand, “Jenga” in real life isn't a cost-prohibitive venture. You just need some cheap wood blocks and you can have the real thing right there. On the other hand, “Jenga”! Either way, “Jenga” by NaturalMotion for iOS (Free) and Android ($2.99) is a very well-executed port of the classic party game. You can play by yourself, pass and play, or play a friend online. For this week's challenge, you can play me directly by searching for the username “dgilmorexu.” Be careful, though. I'll “Jenga” the hell out of you.
Ms. Namba, 49 years old, says her colleagues were upset with her decision to step down. "I have been the CEO for 12 years, and I have learned a lot of things: I am not Steve Jobs.

We promised we would climb to the top of the world together, as a team," she says. She approached Mr. Moriyasu after a morning meeting in May and told him that she was going to step down imminently.

Every year, the districts conduct a "reaping" among teenagers, in which a boy and girl from each district are chosen for the Hunger Games, a combination fight to the death and reality show.

Their victories aren't necessarily final. Honda says it will appeal Peters' award, and AT&T is appealing Spaccarelli's. But the new hearings will basically be reruns of the first ones. They will feature similar and relatively informal rules. So there's no way the companies can use their resources to take a small claims case to a jury trial and force the consumer to rack up enormous legal fees.

If your advisor doesn't have access to Monte Carlo software, ask her to lower the estimated return on the analysis she provides. The result may be that you have to save more to reach your goal.

I took a chance and put a call into Aykroyd at his bungalow on the Paramount Pictures lot in Los Angeles. I left a message on the machine and left my home number.

The students said they planned to sell the product for $19.99, even though it would cost $25 to make — a glitch they said would disappear after more people bought their shoes. The "Swing-It" took third place. A.J. Khubani, CEO of infomercial giant Telebrands and one of the judges on the panel, said his only concern with the "Swing-It" was that "women choose looks over comfort when it comes to shoes."

"Arizona is saying the federal government should have 100 percent enforcement and because it doesn't, we are going to enact our own laws that allow us to enforce in situations where the federal government doesn't."
I read with interest The Times’ article “Filling budget shortfalls — Nursing, care centers prepare for $37.5M funding state budget cuts” (Aug. 7). While the article provides details on the impact to the provider industry and the potential cuts they pass on to their residents, it neglects to provide a meaningful consumer (i.e., public) perspective on the issue.
"What was that?" asked my daughter, who is almost 3.
Dunn's long drive to right off Felipe Paulino gave the White Sox the lead in the first. His sixth homer in his last 10 games was enough offense for Floyd (3-3), who allowed five hits, struck out five and walked two in 7 2-3 innings.

The old logging road has paid the price of the Miami River's fitful nature, said Kate Skinner, assistant district forester. Segments had to be reinforced with riprap where the river took a bite in the past, and slides are a hazard.

Louisiana Secretary of State Jay Dardenne and recently retired state Supreme Court Justice Chet Traylor have acknowledged interest in entering the Republican primary next year but have not committed.

The Jets highlighted the second day of the draft by bolstering their team speed on both sides of the ball. Less than 24 hours after Gang Green stood pat to take a pass rusher in the first round, general manager Mike Tannenbaum returned to his trading ways Friday night by moving up in the second to grab speedy Georgia Tech wide receiver Stephen Hill. The Jets added more speed to their front seven by selecting projected inside linebacker Demario Davis from Arkansas State in the third round.

Wine industry observers who thought it would be just a year or two before Cappelli released a zinfandel under his own brand still are waiting. Instead, he rather enjoys the role of farmer, tending the demanding vines and selling their prized fruit to various wineries in the area.
Scheiber more soberly describes the chaotic business of forming policy in a new administration. But he, too, falls into one of the characteristic traps of White House books — describing policy as a nearly pure exercise in executive will, heavily discounting the degree to which Congress constrains presidential action.

Right now, Berrios says he can only remove exemptions on properties where it's clear the owner isn't calling the place home. But he wants the legislature to pass a law similar to 11 other states that allow local governments to recover taxes owed along with interest and penalties.

A: Agreed. But even if Mike comes around in these next few games, it will be interesting to see how much his role expands, or if there remains lingering concern that it's just a matter of time until the next injury arrives. James Jones' performance Sunday could also change some of the thinking with Miller.
DETROIT - The auto industry looks set to ride the appeal of smaller cars to its best monthly performance in almost four years.
Appeals court Judge Richard Posner had likened the dual convictions to convicting a murderer of attempted murder as well, since the deed followed the attempt. The 7th Circuit also found that the trial court wrongly calculated that Peel intended a loss of more than $1 million, which added prison time to his sentence.
Sparky understood that the norms and mores of baseball had changed since he broke into the game. At times, labor relations between owners and players made contract negotiations between Teamsters and management look like a birthday party. Work stoppages forced gaps in seasons that sometimes went unfilled. Unwelcome as they were, though, they never compromised the integrity of the game.
When natural gas is pulled from the ground, it is 70 percent to 90 percent methane, a simple molecule of carbon and hydrogen that is the most abundant organic molecule on earth. Methane is what gets delivered to homeowners. But the natural gas that comes out of the earth also contains some ethane, propane, butane and other hydrocarbons. These other hydrocarbons are separated from the methane and sold to chemical companies and other industrial users.

It's no longer about the fact that Anthony is looking at another quick first-round exit, which would be No. 8 in nine playoff seasons, or the fact that Anthony can carry a team in the regular season, as he did a few weeks back, but just can't be like LeBron and the other big boys when the games really count .

Cross-checking, hair-pulling, instigating fights  Shanahan has handed out punishments for all those violations, too, with differing results. As a former player of some stature, he took the job determined to bring some predictability to the punishment his office doles out and even explained his decisions with accompanying video evidence. But lately, those explanations have been all over the map. Players no longer know whether the line is being drawn at intent or result  injuring another player  or even the star power of the violator who winds up in the dock. So everybody, from Sidney Crosby to repeat offenders like Torres are getting in on the action.

Whether Ohio's oil and gas lobby was behind the power play or not, it's impossible to ignore that the industry in Ohio is rapidly being transformed from "primarily mom and pops," in the words of Senate President Tom Niehaus, into a collection of some of the industry's biggest names -- ExxonMobil, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Hess Energy, and Devon Energy Corp.

Talk to him about his feelings. Hang a picture of your son in the baby's room to make him feel important. Share how the new baby will appreciate him when he helps by getting a diaper, blanket, toy or whatever it needs. Take your time in slowly introducing him to the thought of becoming a big brother. You may find that "new sibling" classes, which are available in many communities, can be of great assistance as well.
"What we've done in free agency really allows us the chance to go one way or the other," he said. "It's given us flexibility in terms of we can draft into a perceived strength so that we make sure we get the player who's going to help us win a championship the quickest way possible, or we can go and fill in what we perceive as a need.

"They're supposed to write everything down, but in the heat of battle, we have a couple who don't," said manager Casey Kurzinski of the French Laundry in Fenton. "They may think they have an impeccable memory, but one mistake ... makes the restaurant look incompetent." Writing it down is more likely to "make it a perfect experience for the guest," he said.
4. Going to Busch Stadium has been good for the coffers. After earning $2.9 million in gate receipts in Game 2 at Miller Park, the NLCS has shifted to St. Louis where the gate receipts have been $4.3 million in Game 3 and $4.5 in Game 4. Of those two games, the gate receipts have put a combined $5.2 million into the player pool that will be divided at the end of the postseason. Tonight offers an important threshold for any series. Now that the minimum four games are over, more of the revenue goes to the individual clubs. That makes last night's win particularly valuable to the Milwaukee Brewers who now get a financial boost from being assured of at least one game at Miller Park beyond the minimum.

That fear is rooted in past conflicts that mar the city's image to this day -- the civil unrest of 1967, bitter labor strikes that saddled the city with a reputation for union militancy. Understandable as that may be, caving in to those fears of backlash or strife by remaining silent or procrastinating has not served the city well.

The information was there to get, and The Plain Dealer had reported some of it -- but it did so incrementally and without cohesion or consistent followup.

McNerney, a 55-year-old wind energy consultant and entrepreneur from Pleasanton with little political experience, tried without success to unseat Pombo two years ago. In this year's matchup, he was able to gain traction with his call to set a timetable to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, attempts to link Pombo to convicted Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and by embracing the Democratic Party's national mantra that it is time for change.
A final decision on his successor should come shortly thereafter.
Akian has autism, as do the rest of the students in the class. This prevented him from being able to explain to his father if anything had been happening to him at school.

--LHP Hector Santiago was the surprise of the start of the regular season, being named the closer in the second game of the opening series against Texas. Up until that point, manager Robin Ventura and the coaching staff had remained mum on the closer throughout spring camp. But with Santiago losing that closer role, and LHP Chris Sale now going from the starting rotation to that spot, there was speculation that Santiago would be on his way back to Class AAA Charlotte, where he could be stretched out as a starter. Ventura shot that down, however, insisting that Santiago will stay in his current spot as a middle reliever. "I don't see that happening," manager Robin Ventura said of Santiago being optioned out. "You might be jumping the gun a bit. I think we'll use him like we did (in middle relief in Detroit)."

What high school sports means to me: After my knee injury, I've come to cherish them. It's so much fun, an aspect of high school where you wouldn't normally get to hang out with girls of every age and build a bond that you can't take away. You build a family away from home. I hope to get that at college.

First up: Pisa, or more specifically, Piazza del Duomo. I was instantly charmed by a scene straight out of a storybook. The walled square had lush green grass and a cathedral, baptistery and the Leaning Tower constructed of mostly gray marble, white stone and colored marble accents. All three looked surreal. No wonder Italian writer Gabriele d'Annunzio dubbed the square the Field of Miracles.

When asked which rappers inspire him, one name keeps coming up — Curren$y, the New Orleans rapper who signed a deal with Warner Bros. after building a cult-following online. But it isn’t just Curren$y’s grassroots approach that Rome admires.

For Rome, who grew up with a chip on his shoulder to dispel the notion he was “different,” it’s downright liberating.

Unfortunately, Miller's autobiographical tale, as told in "Blue Like Jazz," squanders this potential by failing to take place in a recognizably real world.

Lowery was one of those players singled out by Flood as playing well this spring.. Lowery, who had a disappointing season last year after a promising red-shirt freshman year the season prior, could make things interesting for the line. Considered by most to be the odd-man out of the six players vying for five spots, should Lowery regain his promise he may knock off one of the favorites to the bench and cause further shifting. Coach Flood promises to play his best five linemen. A good scrimmage by Lowery could put Dallas Hendrickson on the bubble as Hendrickson has yet to secure himself a starting job at center. One scenario could even see David Osei, whom Lowery is battling with at RG, moved to LG and Betim Bujari moved to center.

The Nuggets simply didn't run, and when they did run they didn't keep the pace high for any significant stretch of time.
