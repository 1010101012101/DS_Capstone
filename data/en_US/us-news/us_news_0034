Despite the heavy media interest, spectator turnout has been lower than many expected. Courthouse officials said they believe it's partly because of rules that require the public to sign up for seats the day before and partly because of the horrific nature of the case.
Nah, just kidding: “We Live Here” is a family drama in which an impending wedding churns up buried resentments and leads to a reckoning. It almost goes without saying that the upper-middle-class characters have arty professions, drop erudite references while sipping wine and are mildly neurotic.

Architecture: More than 5,000 colonial buildings grace the city with a fantasy of Baroque towers, Moorish domes, kaleidoscopic tiles and plateresque facades. On the main plaza, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception — better known as Puebla Cathedral — built in 1575, boasts Mexico's tallest church towers and is a veritable architectural encyclopedia, with 14 chapels of various styles. Another masterpiece, the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, was built in 1646 for the pontifical seminary and is believed to be the first public library in the Americas. In fact, religion inspired much of Puebla's (and Mexico's) most impressive architecture. One of the most beautiful is the lacy white Templo de la Compañía de Jesus, built by the Jesuits in the 16th century.
Another taster baked the manicotti entree in a conventional oven and found the cheese on top a little stringy, but was otherwise pleased with the results. The only downside was the 9 grams of saturated fat and 660 milligrams of sodium.

NEW YORK – Yankees manager Joe Girardi noticed the splits. Entering last night's game, Orioles left-hander Brian Matusz had allowed lefties a slash line of .154/.214/.154 while righties teed off for a .333/.424./.514. So, Girardi loaded up his lineup with right-handers, meaning the odd alignment of Chris Stewart behind the plate so Russell Martin's bat could stay in the lineup at designated hitter.

Then, Dickson dispatches the smart cop and his none-too-swift partner back to high school. Because of a clerical error, Schmidt finds himself in the drama department and Jenko with the chemistry nerds. Given the changes in high school culture, the qualities that made Schmidt an outsider when he was a senior now admit him to the in crowd. Alas for Jenko, meatheadedness is so 2005.

I have only my brother-in-law, Tim Limbert, to blame, and to thank. It was he, an avid runner and resident of Charleston, who talked me into this nutty adventure.

More than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the blown-out well at the site of BP's Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded April 20 and sank two days later. Crews are using at least six remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve, but so far they've been unsuccessful. Meanwhile, high winds and waves are pushing oily water over the booms meant to contain it. Besides BP, a slew of federal and state agencies are scrambling to minimize the onslaught of damage.

Blue Plate, and more established Chenin-philes like Pine Ridge, have long turned to the grape's obscure California home - Clarksburg, the little-known Sacramento River delta appellation, a place that has managed to hold on to its modest plantings over the years. Despite the constant temptation to plant Chardonnay, Clarksburg's fate seems auspiciously tied with Chenin, enough that a Gerald Asher article once called it "the right grape in the right place."

Advocates state that the gas tax is needed because our aging transportation system is crumbling. To be sure, congestion has grown, but are our roads crumbling as a result? Not according to the Federal Highway Administration's annual highway statistics report. In fact, FHWA shows the percentage of Maryland highways and bridges that are "structurally deficient" or "functionally obsolete" is less than it was in the mid-1990s. The perception of crumbling roadways is often unquestioned because of the I-35 Minnesota bridge collapse, yet federal investigators attributed this tragedy to be caused by faulty design, not under-investment in maintenance.

Sanchez's 1-yard run gave the Jets a score on their first drive, as New York got off to the type of quick start it has been lacking most of this season.

Then there was Table 46, one of The Washington Post's tables, to which I was fortuitously assigned. We were the un-celebrities -- writers, editors, Undersecretary of State Bob Hormats, and a military officer who introduced himself as "Bill." He was obviously important. His dress uniform was festooned with medals and ribbons. He had that bearing we recognize in military elites that betrays another kind of space, a private zone where intelligence and readiness keep each other quiet company.

Collapsing in the face of a Kings rush, the Blues allowed Jeff Carter to follow his initial shot into the slot area and lift the loose puck over Elliott's shoulder for the third goal.

There was really no reason for Brady’s first interception. He should’ve seen Boley underneath. He did a good job of waiting for Branch to clear Kiwanuka but didn’t realize that second window had closed as well. Later, he nearly threw a second interception to Grant when he didn’t see him lurking underneath. The Giants played the second level of their defense close to the line for much of the game. I wonder if part of the thinking there was, in addition to providing run support, it would disguide the LBs and DBs down low who were dropping underneath routes. Regardless of how it was done, it was clear a big part of the Giants’ defensive game plan was to help cover routes underneath up the middle of the field as a defense against Welker and the TEs. And they executed it fantastically.

Counter-terrorism experts also suggest the assassination plot may be linked to an internal power struggle in Tehran between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate control over the Quds force. Given the high level of professionalism of most previous Quds operations, the clumsy way this plot was carried out — almost as if it were intended to be discovered — has led to speculation that it could even have been a deliberate attempt by the Khamenei faction to embarrass President Ahmadinejad and undermine his authority. In the wilderness of mirrors that characterizes Iran's fractured political structure, it may prove impossible to figure out the motivation of all the various players or the rationale behind their actions.

Down the list a little bit is Matt Holliday. The Cardinals' left fielder has 1,294 hits at the break, and according to the Toy he has a 11 percent chance of ripping that 3,000 career hit before he's done.

Sluggers are walked too much to crack out 3,000 hits, and once Rodriguez gets there then it will be awhile before the next "slugger" reaches the mark. That could be Pujols, Berkman said.

øThe biggest complication that will affect many investors is that brokers aren't required to track the cost basis on investments bought many years ago. Also, if you moved from one brokerage firm to another, the firm you're leaving isn't required to forward the cost basis on the stocks to the new brokerage firm. Things can get tricky, too, if you're buying and selling the same investments in two separate brokerage accounts.

There are multiple reasons. Regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are forever a step behind. Alternative trading platforms, or "dark pools" are anonymous, menacing and have been susceptible to market manipulators, critics say.
Even posturing about the issue might sway a few souls. Hence the new Senate bill, introduced yesterday by New York’s own Chuck Schumer and Ben Cardin of Maryland, to criminalize “deceptive” campaign literature, such as giving the wrong date for elections. A similar bill went nowhere four years ago, and this one’s likely just as doomed — but it’s a fine pretext for muddying the debate over voter-ID.

A TBI is caused by a bump, blow, jolt or penetration to the head that disrupts the normal function of the brain. The severity can range from "mild," meaning a brief change in mental status, to "severe," meaning extended unconsciousness or amnesia after the injury. Even when considered "recovered," many survivors cannot return to what they used to do or find appropriate work. And the Brain Injury Alliance of Oregon reports that a survivor of severe brain injury requires between $4.1 million and $9 million in lifetime care.

"Somewhere along the line a few of them realized there were soft pastels you could use to leave color on your hair."
We lost "Lost," "24" and "Law & Order" at the end of last season. "Lost" producers, of course, long ago announced that they'd be calling it quits after six ABC seasons. And Fox's "24" had pretty much run its prime-time course. But NBC's "Law & Order" had some gas left in the story tank, and it certainly deserved the chance to break the "Gunsmoke" record for most seasons by a drama. It's just one example of how shows that the networks canceled were better than the fall newcomers replacing them.

Mayor Bloomberg also performed well -- asserting control, communicating concisely to the public, evacuating sick and infirm residents from hospitals and nursing homes and dishing out dire warnings (“they could die”) for able-bodied, able-minded people who didn’t heed evacuation orders.

Obama also mentioned he might enjoy a shave ice, Hawaii's lighter-flaked snow cone with a rainbow of tropical flavors and toppings to choose from. The local buzz predicted he would favor the original Waiola Bakery and Shave Ice at 2135 Waiola St., which is near Obama's boyhood haunts, or the newer location at 525 Kapahulu Ave., which isn't that far away.

When Seabury pitched the cookbook idea to Dan Lorenzo, the Ramsey-based guitarist with the ‘80s thrash metal band Hades (with a reunion show next month in Clifton) and the ‘90s grunge band Non Fiction, Lorenzo knew it would be a hit (and indeed, Seabury is already planning a sequel.)

A few days before the MCA opening, Johnson stood in the center of a gallery and cast a seriously-don't-talk-to-me-now look on his face. Museum workers swirled around him and artwork sat on the floor, covered in blankets; bubble wrap lay strewn about. Johnson was quiet, moving from room to room. He bundled his dreadlocks together, tied them in a bun, then a moment later, he released them. Then repeated the process.

The Oregonian News Network: Yes, there are a ton of people up there doing their own neighborhood news sites. These folks cover breaking news and are often the first media responders to house fires and things like that. It’s very different here in Oregon. There are very few people doing that here. The ‘why’ is probably less important than just figuring out how to work with local folks and support their vision. We want to shape a program that is unique to Oregon and the Portland Metro area.

The BLM has been dutifully restoring Headwaters, roughly half of which is composed of untouched virgin timber. The other half was logged at one point or another as far back as the 1880s. BLM crews have eliminated 10 miles of old logging roads. They've conducted regular wildlife surveys for endangered spotted owls, salmon and other species (although it's too soon to see much change in animal numbers, they report). And they have thinned more than 1,000 acres of small Douglas fir trees to speed the return of massive redwoods.

Some private investment firms get into managing organizations on a more granular level and that's just not what TSG brings to the table. I have a conversation about once a month with my counterpart there, and they certainly get involved from a board standpoint quarterly. But if we did our job and did it well, they would let us manage our company the way we did prior to their investment. As a kind of a distant cousin of that brand (Stumptown), I can say they couldn't have chosen a better private equity firm as a partner.
Those left from the uprising that swelled through Tahrir Square last year and brought down Hosni Mubarak live in tents, harassed and cursed, but mostly forgotten. TV cameras no longer perch on balconies; the great banners have been spooled away. The slogans of rebellion have been pressed onto T-shirts, and tourists, their expressions saying they somehow expected more, take pictures, trying to summon the images that captivated the world those many months ago.
The 166-year-old news cooperative filed suit in Manhattan federal court yesterday against the 11-year-old Meltwater, a San Francisco-based clipping service that helps clients monitor press coverage.
Unfortunately, on Tuesday a spill of similar size to the April 4 spill occurred when a pipeline ruptured on the Mexican side of the border, leaking some 2 million gallons of sewage into the Tijuana River Valley for about 12 hours. As was the case with the April 4 spill, this flow also reached the ocean.

Trayvon, 17, was killed Feb. 26 in Sanford, Fla. when Zimmerman, a member of a neighborhood watch group, shot the unarmed teen. Zimmerman, 28, said he shot the boy in self-defense, and police in Florida declined to prosecute him — a decision that was condemned by civil rights groups and others who questioned the role that race might have played in the case. Trayvon was African-American; Zimmerman is Latino.

Finally, if you're repaying student loans, you may get the 1098-E. This form is sent out if you made $600 or more in interest payments on qualified loans last year. The good news: Depending on your income, up to $2,500 in student loan interest is deductible.
Students range in ages from 11 to 14 in grades six to eight.
"This misses the big picture," he said. "Raising tax rates to chase soaring spending would upset a far more fundamental balance in this country -- the balance between the federal government and a free and vibrant private economy. More space for government means less space for individual Americans to pursue and enjoy the rewards of hard work, industry, risk-taking and innovation."

But it isn't enough. Krymov seems so enamored of his inventive stagings - most of which we've seen handled more creatively by other directors - that he lingers on effects long enough to make us wonder what purpose they serve. Meanwhile, the story goes begging in the streets of Paris, and a mere 80 minutes of theater seems a lot longer.
"For years we asked, 'Is it working?' and they said. 'We're still implementing,'" said Farooqi, the psychiatrist at Patton. "When it was finally time to see the effects, they changed everything. They have basically thrown everything out."
"All About Eve: The Photography of Eve Arnold," features stills that defined Arnold's 50-year career before she died in January, just months short of her 100th birthday. The exhibition, which opened in early March, demonstrates her expertise in capturing the unguarded moments of her subjects.

For four years, Campagna watched as Chinese factory workers churned out aluminum products for Peerless. The company had outsourced those goods because it lacked aluminum dye-casting equipment and expected savings from China's reduced costs.
Under this plan, year after year, seniors would be forced to pay more and more out of their own pockets to keep their health plan, or risk losing access to their doctors or losing benefits. Thus, the voucher program would shift significant costs to already cash-strapped seniors.
Although a blended orgasm will offer a woman plenty of pleasure, the truth is that all orgasms are created equal. It is risky to suggest that one type of orgasm is better than another, or that women who don't reach vaginal orgasm easily are less sexually attune than women who do. Freud himself once described a clitoral orgasm as "immature," suggesting that vaginal orgasms are the true goal of sexual fulfillment. Talk about pressure! Women often have a hard enough time relaxing and enjoying sex without feeling like their natural responses are "immature" or not good enough.

It would not be fair to all those previous college students who have worked their way through college or borrowed what they could to finance their college education and didn't get any federal relief. People need to take some responsibility for their actions and not expect the federal government to come to their aid every time something doesn't go their way.
The scoop: Thomas should be back giving the team its first senior leader at the position since Dennis Dixon in 2007. He already holds the program's all-time record for passing touchdowns (66) and needs 2,434 passing yards to surpass Bill Musgrave in that category (8,140). Bennett saw time this season and impressed, giving the Ducks a rare, proven and experienced backup.

Assemblywoman Connie Wagner (D-Paramus) introduced the legislation earlier this month, which would distribute Teterboro land among South Hackensack, Moonachie, Little Ferry and Hasbrouck Heights, according to the report. Officials hope the move would reduce services and increase efficiency, the report said. But State Sen. Paul Sarlo told the newspaper Friday that officials want to refine the legislation, which passed both houses' budget committees this week, with advice from the governor's and Legislature's lawyers.

Horner has been riding well for the team this year, but he doesn't yet know if he'll make the final cut for the Tour. He's thought to be the only Oregonian to ride the fabled race, which he's done three times, but never on a team like this. And while he is on the strongest team, he still has to fight for one of just nine spots on the Astana squad that will start the Tour in Monaco on July 4.

Her pop star older sister casts a large shadow, but Knowles has tried to stay out of it, forging her own music career as well as a fashion presence that leans more toward downtown chic than Beyoncé's va-va voom.

The Wildcats were, and haven't lost since. Jones and Wiltjer already have joined a choice group of players with Oregon ties who have reached the Final Four, a list that boasts names such as Kyle Singler, Kevin Love, Mike Dunleavy and Damon Stoudamire, and if Kentucky can win twice more, the company becomes even more select.
And just hours before Rybak touted his plans, several legislators from Minneapolis, including DFL Sen.

The March change in nonfarm payrolls was very disappointing, with only 120,000 jobs added. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect total nonfarm payrolls rose by a faster 168,000 in April, but that rate is not fast enough to change the jobless rate, which is forecast to remain at 8.2 percent.
It's a funny situation because it cuts both ways. On the one hand, it's idiotic to pretend that walking across a parking lot is the same thing as walking down 42nd Street. The buzz of Broadway doesn't start and stop with what's onstage. It's that whole neighborhood, famously heralded for its hip-hooray and ballyhoo. Broadway means a sense of history and the thrill of never knowing who might be sitting on the next barstool or coming around the corner. It is a street songs are written for. It's not a generic label.
A cardboard "No Parking" sign taped to a tree on DeSota Avenue dates to some old roadwork, according to Road Rant tipster Yisroel Wilks, who lives nearby.

JULIANNA MARGULIES - "THE GOOD WIFE" (CBS)
There's no reason to doubt the sincerity of Zimmerman's friends when they say the man is devastated by the tragic events of Feb. 26. And there's every reason to advocate that everyone take a deep breath and condemn the vigilante mentality that has "The New Black Panther Party" idiotically placing a $10,000 bounty for the "capture" of a man who is not a fugitive and Louis Farrakhan saying "soon, very soon, the law of retaliation may . . . be applied."

Fischer interjected and said they could but disagreed with them being collected as evidence.

The highs and lows tell me the menu needs cutting. Clemons is a talented and ambitious guy. But it takes discipline to come up with ideas, then give them the ax if they don't work.
