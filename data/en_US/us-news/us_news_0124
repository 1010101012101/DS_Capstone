(The varietals of the different types of grapes that are currently used to make Madeira versus the ones used in years past are too complex to describe here, but those who are interested should consult Berk's version of "Island Vineyard.")

A gaffe, as someone once said, is when a politician tells the truth. This is a bit imprecise. The term "politician" covers any political actor, certainly including Limbaugh. And the troublesome statement needn't be the truth, as it certainly wasn't in this case: more like "the truth about what he or she is really thinking." The typical gaffe is what they used to call a "Freudian slip." But, with all due respect to Freud, why should something a politician says by accident — and soon wishes he hadn't, whether true or not — automatically be taken as a better sign of his or her real thinking than something he or she says on purpose?

The recent ruling is a victory for the Minority Television Project, a nonprofit corporation that operates KMTP-TV in the San Francisco area. KMTP promotes itself as a provider of multicultural programming serving underrepresented groups. KMPT sued the Federal Communications Commission on First Amendment grounds, seeking the right to fund its operation by selling commercials.

KMTP and the FCC are quite familiar with each other. The FCC has fined the station thousands of dollars during the last decade for airing commercials.
The sculpture by Robert Indiana erected in 2002-03 was balked at for its $311,000 price, but it now is embraced by many residents and visitors. The giant letters are between the Civic Center Library and the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts. It is one of five editions that the artist created, not including two proofs. The red and blue edition is identical to the one in New York City. Indiana was inspired to create the design by a banner he saw in church as a young boy. It read, "God is Love." In the '60s, he designed a Christmas card for the Museum of Modern Art in New York with the design, and it was the beginning of the LOVE craze that has endured for decades.

Justice Scalia mused that everyone is also in the market for food at one point or another and asked whether the government might also require people to buy broccoli. That analogy also misses the mark. The implication of Justice Scalia's question is that the individual mandate is a paternalistic effort by government to require people to do what's good for them.

Moreover, it was, in Congress' judgment, a necessary and proper law for carrying out other reforms that are clearly within its powers, such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. Without the mandate, only those who are sick would obtain insurance, which defeats the purpose.

The Grenache hails from two notable sites, Sumu Kaw and Fenaughty, at 2,500 and 2,850 feet, and its big, warm profile is packed with mineral and clove-spiced strawberry, with a slight tarry side.

And this little get-together had one other big problem: "They didn't notify me, and I'm a commissioner," Richardson complained. "I would probably have gone, in case they talked about city business."
I am nearly 80 years old, and my memory is getting a little dim, but I remember vividly a late-season Sunday doubleheader against the dreaded Yankees at the old stadium in 1948. I think they were one game ahead of us in the standings. There were almost 80,000 fans, including thousands standing behind the fence in the outfield. I was seated in Section 22, upper deck, right behind home plate.
With the 169th pick in the NFL draft (fifth round), the Ravens selected Cal Poly cornerback Asa Jackson.
"Spork" is the teenage musical Disney will never make. The title character is a 13-year-old who identifies as a girl but has an intersex condition, making her even more of a misfit in school than she would be anyway, with her nest of ratty hair and lack of social skills and coordination. When she goes up against the school mean girls in a talent contest to win money so she can make herself pretty, the stage is set for a "Middle School Musical" finale. The child actors in this film are terrific.
Give Raymond Wiggins a bicycle  any bike will do: cruiser, mountain bike, BMX, even a 10-speed  and watch him transform it to something extraordinary, something more valuable than merely a mode of transportation.
That statement is based on the detection of extremely small quantities of the isotopes cesium-137 and iodine-131 in the environment near the plant. Those two elements are byproducts of uranium fission. During the normal operation of a reactor, cesium-137 and iodine-131 migrate to the gap between the fuel pellets and the zirconium cladding. The fact that some quantities escaped into the environment suggests the cladding heated up and cracked to some degree. That does not mean any fuel has melted, although it is possible that a small amount did. Barring a major catastrophe, no one will know whether fuel has melted until they can get into the containment vessel and examine it.

"We discovered a computer programming error that resulted in not giving enough credit to places like Cleveland that had big declines in their unemployment rates," economist Howard Wial, one of the study's authors, said Monday.

Mathematicians who study voting systems say all of them have some drawbacks—often unforeseen ones—and these can depend on the voters and what is being voted on. Donald G. Saari, a mathematician at the University of California, Irvine, says difficulties can and likely will arise with the Academy's methods. "Can the Academy find ways to get around these difficulties?" says Prof. Saari. "Of course. Many such methods exist."
This round started when Slay submitted his bills through an ally on the board. Reed declined to assign them to a committee, where they would be debated, and, if approved, sent back to the full board for a vote.

The word Vodu, when broken down to its meaning, would surprise most people. Vo means "introspection" while du means "into the unknown". It is an ancient practice, much older than the world's major religions, and was carried over from Africa during the times of slavery. It involves an extremely complex and sophisticated philosophical system whose knowledge extends to the core of the natural world and to the ancestral spirits whom provide the religion's foundation. In Haitian Creole the expression, "sonde' miroi," which translated means "plumb the depths of the mirror" or "search in the mirror," can be understood as one of its great secrets.

I started with a "cupping," which sounds vaguely lewd, but is a term for a formal coffee tasting. The Stumptown cafe lined up cups of java brewed from beans that varied by country, climate and color. The cupping process involves sipping with sharply indrawn breath, pulling air over the tongue to savor the flavors. Like wine tastings, I noticed subtleties only upon the manager's suggestion (leather? papaya?). Nevertheless, it was a fun way to learn about new blends while riding a hand-trembling caffeine buzz.
Meanwhile, when the water comes to a boil, stir in 2 tablespoons of salt. Cook the penne in the boiling water until it's al dente. (Begin checking for doneness after 8 minutes of cooking. Bite down on the pasta and look for a tiny white dot in the center of the noodle. It should be firm, but not hard.) Drain the pasta into a colander, shaking assertively to remove as much of the water as possible.

"Nothing has happened like this around here in a long time. So it's a matter of opening the door. If you have something I'm around, I'm available, here's how you get a hold of me. I just want to learn how things went in the past that were great, and if you have a suggestion I'm all ears."

Hey, Tony: OK. The whole Hillis situation is just plain weird. It's the coach's decision to pull him out, then it's a hamstring, then magically he's healed and playing. I have not read from any writer exactly what Hillis is asking for and exactly what the Browns are willing to pay. Or even, how far apart are they? How about some details? -- Ernie Logothetides, Lyndhurst

A. This genetically altered form of wheat has been transformed into such a destructive "food" that any amount has the potential to trigger undesirable consequences.

You say, "What the heck!"... Before you know it, the floodgates of appetite have been reopened by exposure to the gliadin protein of wheat, the component responsible for triggering appetite — and you promptly gain back 30 pounds.

Shooting on "Magic City" wrapped last fall, but Ms. Ramsey spent about $100,000 to hold on to rented costumes until season-two production starts later this year. One reason: to keep the outfits from popping up on rival shows. For the same reason, Ms. Ramsey keeps a close eye on shows like "Mad Men." She spotted Betty Draper (played by January Jones) in the same ivory-colored chiffon cocktail dress that she was planning to put on a "Magic City" character. "We yanked that right out," she says.

Among the proposed revisions to the school employee retirement system, one of the worst is that current school employees would not qualify for retiree health benefits until 60 years of age. It is not reasonable to expect that all teachers will be physically and emotionally able to teach until 60. It is not good policy to require this of Michigan's teachers.

Morse was a brilliant, soon-to-be-wealthy entrepreneur who was born in Denver and settled in Cleveland. Mrs. Morse was a cultivated, well-educated Cleveland native. They met at a concert and shared a love of all the arts. They saw a visiting show by Dalí at the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1942, shortly before they married. As a belated wedding gift to each other, they bought their first Dalí painting in 1943. And never stopped. In the late 1970s, they decided to donate their collection, which by then totaled about 1,400 works, including 93 paintings, to a museum. Problem was, no one wanted it because of the restriction that came with it to keep the collection intact.

Wilson, as John Reed described him, possessed -- or, perhaps, was possessed by -- "a principle, a religion, a something on which his whole life rests." He entered politics from academia believing that social transformation could be promoted by "some great orator who could go about and make men drunk with his spirit of self-sacrifice." More than 100,000 Americans, intoxicated by that spirit or not, ultimately would die for it in World War I and the imperialist adventures in Latin America that preceded it. Lears has a particularly sharp eye for Wilson's embrace of the Anglophilic racial fantasies that helped fuel the psycho-social transformation culminating in the Great War. He not only repeats the familiar story of Wilson's screening of D.W. Griffith's race-baiting "Birth of a Nation" in the White House, but also points out that, as president, he addressed the Civil War veterans assembled to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Gettysburg without once mentioning blacks, slavery or emancipation.

This sad, pathetic excuse of a leader continues daily to show just how weak he is, but the media make it a circus, like this pronouncement is something new.

Mr. al-Awlaki appears to be the first American citizen to have been targeted in this way. The strike by an armed Predator drone took place in Yemen, a country with which we are not at war and which lies far from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Alzheimer's disease doesn't seem like a great subject for a page-turner. Affecting 10% of us over 65 and 50% older than 85, it inspires dread in the culture. And yet a page-turner is exactly what Alice LaPlante has crafted with "Turn of Mind," a novel told from the point of view of a woman with dementia. LaPlante manages to take hold of the aforementioned dread and modulate it, creating a startling range and texture of fear. From agonizing, slow-motion-car-crash moments to the ironic frissons of a good horror movie, she hits every bell.
