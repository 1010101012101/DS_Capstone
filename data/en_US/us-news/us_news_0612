Newbie says: The menu calls the place "Home of the Sauce" and says ribs are served with it unless otherwise requested; we did not request otherwise. The smoky-sweet sauce complements these impossibly tender, six-hour smoked spare ribs rubbed with a blend of paprika, salt and cayenne.

"It's kind of exciting that they're on a team that's so good. Nine starters. Pitching depth. The closing is good. You've got four outfielders. There's no team in baseball that has four outfielders that are that good, that equal. They are really, really deep there. That comes and goes because you've keep all of those guys. This team is really unique. I think it's better than the team in 2006" Prospect Brett Wallace "was certainly the currency that allowed them to make this deal happen. There could have been a lot of choices made with a lot of different players, but (Jeff Luhnow's) selection really allowed the gateway for a guy like Holliday to get here. He deserves a lot of credit for that." "Offers that are made to arbitration-eligible and under-control players are completely different than offers made to free-agent players. You can look to the market for that. Franchise players have a particular market value because they offer leadership, they offer a face of the franchise, they offer so much different than somebody who is under control. And really does not have the opportunity to provide a benefit to the franchise so immediately."

Helping the ocean while dining in the Florida Keys -- Visitors to the Keys can help the ocean while dining on a mild white fish that has gained popularity in Florida Keys restaurants. Lionfish, an invasive Indo-Pacific species, has found a place as a regular menu item at the Key Largo Conch House in lionfish tacos for lunch and a daily dinner special, Key Largo's Fish House Encore serves fried whole lionfish as an appetizer and prepares the filets, likened to hogfish and snapper, in a variety of ways. Although not yet a regular menu item, a Southwestern-style lionfish chowder can be found at Kev's Café, in Islamorada at Bud N' Mary's Marina. Unlike lobster or stone crab, two of the Keys' seasonal seafood resources, lionfish can be captured year-round. There is no season and no size or bag limit. In addition, local commercial fishermen sell the lionfish by-catch to restaurants. For restaurant details, visit www.keylargoconchhouse.com, www.fishhouse.com, or www.budnmarys.com/deli.html.

As Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the Iranian Resistance, has reiterated, the Iranian crisis has an Iranian solution: democratic change by Iranians and their organized resistance.

While he's willing to dish on Simpson, he was more gentlemanly about Aniston, whom he called "the most communicative, sweetest, kindest person." (So why is Jennifer Aniston more deserving of discretion than Jessica Simpson? Is it because she's more a target of public sympathy than public ridicule? After thinking about it some more, we've come to conclusion that he probably thinks he's paying her a huge compliment. What gal doesn't want her bedroom behavior discussed in Playboy?

Here is what I would have told Mr. Rodricks if he had bothered to ask. I don't think we need to make our state the highest income tax state in the nation. I don't think that prospect is something we should be particularly proud of. And I believe that there are more cuts to be made in the budget. Perhaps if you read the budget you might agree that it's unwise to spend tens of millions of dollars in subsidies to the horse racing industry or over $100 million on two mass transit lines that won't be built for decades. Last time I looked, the state is not rolling in cash. More importantly, our citizens are suffering through a serious economic downturn.

Still, Bevilacqua said, there are significant risks in pinning the team's future to a long-term TV play, especially if the team becomes a part owner of the network.

Court approval of homosexual divorce starts us down an irreversible slippery slope, opening the door to sibling and polygamous divorce, making a mockery of traditional separation. With divorce cheapened by opening it to gays, straights won't file for it.

That's their core defense, but they'll throw in some wrinkles to try to get Aaron Rodgers out of rhythm."

The sheer scope of the ad effort — $25 million in one month in the battlegrounds of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida and Colorado — illustrates the huge advantage the incumbent Democrat has over Romney. Obama is tapping into a campaign bank account of more than $100 million to pay for his big opening salvo in the TV ad wars while Romney scurries to catch up after a costly and contentious primary season. The presumptive GOP nominee is relying on outside groups — like the pro-Romney Restore Our Future political action committee — to keep him competitive on the air against Obama's behemoth campaign.

What Pearlman is evoking is the difficulty of intimate interaction, the inevitable distance between even the closest human beings. Again and again here, in extreme circumstances or otherwise, people try, without ever fully succeeding, to connect. In "Fidelity," an aging travel writer begins to invent locations as a way of getting even with his editor, who once had an affair with his wife. The editor publishes these pieces anyway, out of obligation, or even guilt. Then the final article arrives in the mail, and its précis on the kingdom of Azula trails off into imprecations: "Soon the volcano will erupt or the earth crack open; or perhaps one hot afternoon we will simply fail to emerge from the river, will sink into that blue that never changes, unlike the fitful New York sky you and she watched those afternoons Greg you bastard."

For many years the U.S. and NATO military forces have been at war with our enemies in Afghanistan and occasionally Pakistan, where sincere support for our cause has been lacking even though they are receiving billions of dollars of financial aid annually from the U.S. Even though the U.S is unhappy with Pakistan's lackadaisical attitude toward the prevailing problem, it appears to be completely ignored there by some prominent individuals who have openly spoken out and taken action in support of the terrorists but as yet haven't been brought to court.

Look at the situation. They pushed the Pats all over the field during the first 15 minutes. And then Brady hit them in the chops as the clock ran down for the first half and for all their good work, they left the field trailing.

I watched the election returns last night with several hundred USC students, the majority of whom had supported Obama's candidacy. But even those of us who cast our ballots for his opponent understood that we were not only watching history in the making but seeing politics in an extraordinary and unique light. By that, I'm not referring to the specific outcome. Whether the right candidate won is obviously a matter of individual perspective and preference. But it's been a long time since I've seen the exhilaration that I witnessed on campus last night. Young people of all races, genders and political ideologies woke up this morning with a fundamentally different and expanded view of what their own futures might hold.

That’s a good thing, and those school-made resumes can be good tools. But over the years, I’ve come to recognize some weaknesses in the classroom version. In a strong market, these soft spots wouldn’t matter, but when jobs are harder to come by, you need more strategy.

øLefty Gio Gonzalez (2-1) allowed two runs, three hits and five walks through six innings, and struck out seven. He'd gone 6-0 in his previous eight starts since last Sept. 12 - the Nationals haven't scored more than two runs in any of his five starts while he's been in the game.
Camp Dark Waters started 83 years, and has plenty of practice dealing with hot summer days, Eager said. The kids might also choose swim in the camp's pool, or in the creek, if enough sign up. The camp's supervisors make sure to keep the kids hydrated and watch out for warning signs of heat exhaustion. This does not prevent worried parents from calling though.

The Democratic governor also changed the way the state approaches budgeting. In the past, budget talks usually revolved around the gulf between state revenues and the money it would take to keep current services running.

In its motion, the ACLU noted concerns about how the state would collect, store and protect the personal information that people would be required to present. They also cited the likely "substantial costs" of implementing the new standards and said many people — such as domestic violence victims, homeless people and Americans who were born in other countries — would likely face new, major hurdles in getting or renewing licenses.
But there is another rule of vice presidential selection that demands consideration when the country is closely divided politically: Choose someone who is capable of delivering electorally. In 1960, John F. Kennedy picked Lyndon B. Johnson as his vice presidential choice because he knew the general election would be close and he needed Johnson to help him carry the South.

She tells me her boy is more than just a repeat drunk driver.
Now, let's say the Giants try to protect themselves with a modest offer and Kiwanuka believes a team out there would be willing to give him more guaranteed money. (Or that as long as he's a Giant he'll be stuck playing at least a bit of linebacker, which is something he's accepted very reluctantly.) He might opt to test free agency, meaning the Giants could lose him and then learn Umenyiora is holding out or demanding a trade. So in a sense, you have two of your defensive ends in uncertain situations right now. Suddenly, the strongest part of the roster has the potential to grow weaker by 50 percent.

We were on course to have another February primary this year, but Gov.

"The private possession and breeding of big cats simply exacerbates welfare and public safety problems—as we saw with the incident in Zanesville, Ohio, last year—and does not nothing to contribute to global conservation efforts for the species,’’ he said.
Another factor could have been a "mirage." This theory from historian and author Tim Maltin, who spent six years researching ship and weather records and survivor accounts, concluded the cold Labrador current mixed with the warm Gulf stream air creating a thermal inversion in which air at the surface was colder and denser than air above. This could have caused a haze as reported by the look out, creating an optical illusion distorting the way the icebergs looked and distress rockets appeared in sky and affected Morse code communication.

I've written about Wesley before. His basketball connections are deep and unmistakable. And while I've cringed watching Calipari take three teams to the Final Four, and so far, vacate two of the appearances, anyone who saw Monday's NCAA Championship game knows that Calipari and Wesley as coach-broker are the closest thing to a basketball ballet. And so it's time for Allen to start wooing these two with his yachts, and submarine, and Italian villa.
And perhaps most importantly, she has impeccable basketball genes.
Faried frustrated Griffin for much of the evening. The Clippers star missed seven of his dozen field-goal attempts, including a dunk he banged off the back rim.
Left winger Andy McDonald added: "I think (the No. 1 position) is great for the confidence in this room. We've had some injuries and the guys that have played a lot of minutes for us, it's really a tribute to them. It's a good feeling, but we realize we've got some hockey left to play."

Gingrich requested a Secret Service detail in February and received it in early March, by which point Santorum had already emerged as Mitt Romney's chief rival. Santorum left the race last week, but Gingrich lingers on.

But Collymore isn't well-connected in Portland's small black population, and gaffes haven't helped. She released a campaign video in which five supporters spoke, all white. A 2009 tape of a public interview for an open state Senate seat came back to haunt her. In it, she's asked whether race should play a role in choosing a successor to Sen. Margaret Carter in a densely African American area. Collymore told of being more afraid of the black drug dealers than the white one on the television show "Weeds," and said diversity in leadership is important "so you feel more than just, 'I am afraid of the drug dealer even though I am a black person.'"

In his speech in Dixon, Ill., Santorum compared his outsider candidacy to Reagan's insurgency bid in 1976, when he challenged the GOP's establishment choice, President Gerald Ford. But a more apt analogy could be made between Reagan's re-election bid in 1984 and Obama's this year.

* The NFL wanted a consecutive multi-year commitment to London from a franchise to serve as a "host" team. Kroenke's Rams make perfect sense given his ownership of Arsenal of the EPL. (The same reason why the Tampa Bay Bucs, owned by the Glazer family, has played two of the last three games in London. The Glazers own EPL kingpin Manchester United.) Forget this junk about the Rams expanding their brand; much of this is about Kroenke enhancing his popularity in London. Arsenal fans still aren't sure what to make of Kroenke; he's made gains but still needs to win them over. This should help. And Kroenke clearly desires to be an international sports entrepreneur; his presence as an increasingly prominent sports tycoon in Europe can only help open doors to potential business deals that have nothing to do with sports.

He saved his worst for Lorre: "I've spent, I think, close to the last decade, I don't know, effortlessly and magically converted your tin cans into pure gold. And the gratitude I get is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to write." Sheen, the highest-paid man on television who managed to boost his salary to $1.2 million an episode despite being under investigation for attacking his wife and threatening to have her killed, later called TMZ.com, saying Lorre is a "punk" who "took money out of my pocket, out of my family's pocket, and, most importantly, my second family -- my crew's pocket ...

Duncan said the talk of Scrabble as a starter for 2012 has not penetrated the clubhouse. ("We haven't talked about it in here, if that's what you're asking," the PC said.) He said that idea probably comes from the number of pitches that Rzepczynski has to utilize. But it does gloss over the two other facts: 1) Where Rzepczynski will be most-needed in 2012, and 2) being a burgeoning lefty specialist in a division that includes Joey Votto and Jay Bruce and could still house Fielder has real value. What the future holds for Rzepczynski will be a conversation for later.

Great location: In Tower City, right by The Q, perfect if you're attending the Cleveland International Film Festival next week or a Cavs game. Great prices: $4 appetizers, half-off on drinks. But somehow Happy Hour here -- 4-7 p.m. daily -- wasn't as happy as I'd imagined. Yes, it was affordable. The decor was fun. The bruschetta with roasted red peppers was tasty. But even a killer riff needs a chorus -- and I just found it hard to sing along. Maybe it's because it took 20 minutes for the salsa and chips to arrive. Or the appetizers were a tad slight.

_ "The Matrix" (1999): The ultimate popcorn movie. I accompanied a friend to the premiere with no idea what I was walking into and had about as much fun as I've ever had in a movie theater. Spectacular, mind-bending premise which provides the seductive setting for a story delivered with style and precision and more shell casings than all the "Rambo" movies combined. The sequels never quite lived up to this promise, but I can't hold that against this perfect piece of wired-action pie.

The result is "The Gay Debate: The Bible and Homosexuality." It's a video -- you can find it online with a simple Google search -- of a speech he gave in March at a church in Wichita, Kan., that has become a minor sensation. Small wonder. Vines' speech is a masterwork of scriptural exegesis and a marvel of patient logic, slicing and dicing with surgical precision the claim that homophobia is God ordained.

And he has to keep the defense off of those guys. Sometimes a sniper is going to get more attempts one night than he does the next night. Maybe they double team LA one night and you get a lot of shots, or maybe they don’t double team and you don’t get as many. But you have to keep your head in that game and understand that defensively you have to have an impact, and then offensively, if they give you your shot, you have to take them out.
