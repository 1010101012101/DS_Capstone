There are only a few places to dine outdoors near Union Square, and they're always crowded, which makes Chez Papa Resto special. Although this French-inspired restaurant opened a few years ago, the lacy green canopy of vines that helps shade the 30-seat, granite-tiled patio is just beginning to provide protection. The restaurant, set off Fifth Street across from Westfield San Francisco Centre and next to the Old Mint, feels very European, and there's plenty of room to put those shopping bags.

Some State Budget 101 is in order. Maryland's planned $35.4 billion in spending next year falls into four categories: general funds, special funds, federal funds and higher education funds. The higher education fund is slated to grow by 3 percent, which roughly corresponds to the projected increase in tuition. The federal fund covers the portion of state services paid for by the federal government — the largest part of which is the federal match for state Medicaid expenditures. It is slated to decline slightly, mostly due to dropping food stamp caseloads. The special funds cover things like the Transportation Trust Fund, Chesapeake Bay restoration funds and open space funds. They are slated to go up substantially even under the "doomsday" scenario — about 8.5 percent — in part because of the doubling of the flush tax.

A: The best advice I have is to back up your key files, like documents and photos, on a frequent basis. And I would do this in two ways—locally, on an external hard disk, and remotely, to a cloud-based backup service. Software to do this locally is built into both Windows PCs and Macs, and there are third- party programs available. For remote backup, which usually costs money after an introductory amount, there are services like Carbonite and CrashPlan (which can also handle local backups.) My colleague Katie Boehret recently reviewed CrashPlan here: http://bit.ly/zIxStH.

Ian is very focused and knows that in order to achieve his goals he needs to take advantage of his free time every day by being productive."

Last week Nike declared victory over Reebok at one aspect of the NFL merchandise game. Last week, Reebok agreed to rid stores of thousands of jerseys and T-shirts it stamped with the name of New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow. That announcement followed a judge's issuing a restraining order against Reebok April 4 preventing it from selling of the jerseys. The judge sided with Nike which had sued, saying Reebok did not have permission to sell the jerseys, which are expected to be among the fastest-selling of the Nike line. When Tebow was a member of the Denver Broncos, his jersey last season was the No. 2 seller in the NFL to No. 1 Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers.
It's now going by "ACH."

One of the reasons the Blazers came up short was Hickson missing two free throws in the final minute, perhaps his only blemish on the night. With the Blazers leading 95-93 with 57.8 seconds left, he went to the line, where he was a 60 percent foul shooter. Randy Foye capitalized on the misses by making a three-pointer with 47.8 seconds left to give the Clippers the lead.

But Bateson's intent in "The Final Leap" is not these portraits in miniature, however poignant, nor any overriding concern for the Bay Area as Suicide Central in comparison to other American regions. Bateson's central concern in this book is this: Why do we continue to allow the Golden Gate Bridge to remain such an attractive and convenient place for self-annihilation, whether planned or on impulse? Take the Colorado Bridge over the Arroyo in Pasadena, as an example. In the early years in the 20th century, this bridge also had a suicide problem. When barriers were erected, the problem went away.
Over the last several decades, New Jersey’s statistical center has gradually crept its way south and west along the New Jersey Turnpike as growth in the southern and western portions of the state has outpaced the north. According to the 2010 Census, Essex County was one of just two counties in the state to lose population in the last decade. Gloucester, Burlington and Atlantic counties in southern New Jersey, however, each had gains of more than 5 percent.

Newport Beach encroachments. In late 2005, my then-assistant Anna and I performed a rudimentary land survey of beachfront homes and discovered that several owners had built patios and landscaped onto the public sand. This led to a thorough survey of the entire residential oceanfront in Newport and the discovery that about 80 homeowners were encroaching. The value of this land, were it on the open market, would be in the tens of millions. Some homeowners pulled back voluntarily, others are still in negotiations with the city and the Coastal Commission. Frankly, I think the government is dropping the ball again because it's now been two years. See complete story package on my homepage.

Sendak, who died early Tuesday in Danbury, Conn., at age 83, four days after suffering a stroke, revolutionized children's books and how we think about childhood simply by leaving in what so many writers before had excluded. Dick and Jane were no match for his naughty Max. His kids misbehaved and didn't regret it and in their dreams and nightmares fled to the most unimaginable places. Monstrous creatures were devised from his studio, but no more frightening than the grownups in his stories or the cloud of the Holocaust that darkened his every page.
Also, the single family lodger is potentially an exception to the usual rule in California that requires a landlord to utilize the unlawful detainer process in the Superior Court to evict a tenant. Under Section 1946.5, a single-family lodger who does not leave after the 30 day notice expires becomes a trespasser and, in theory, can be removed by the police without requiring the landlord to complete the unlawful detainer process.
The result was hyperinflation, an episode that scars Germany's psyche as much as the Depression does in the U.S. The Reichsbank's successor, the Bundesbank, safeguarded Germany's postwar recovery by focusing on a single mandate to keep inflation low, a duty enshrined in the ECB's charter.

Second, again, before tourism, is making this a nice place to live. The most important thing that our city needs to recruit is not just industry or capital but talent. I agree with Richard Florida that one of the main ways a city can recruit and retain talent is by having a robust artistic expression in the way we plan our city and live our lives. The most important thing is to keep that in mind as we make decisions. I think keeping that in mind is more important than granular tactical play. I think that arts in schools, arts education, helps a lot. It's important. It can help graduation rates, economic competitiveness. As we are working on an education district downtown, using that as an opportunity to encourage Portland State University to amplify its film school or at least its film offerings, there are other ways we can help in the education sector. The list of moves is long enough that probably the most important is keeping an eye on having a good strategic plan.

Here's a look at three Young Americans who represent its past, present and future – all at the same time.
1. Luke Donald, England -- Having lost the No. 1 spot in the World Golf Rankings for the second time this season, Donald again will try to get it right back when he tees it up this week in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. When Rory McIlroy ended Luke's 40-week run atop the rankings by winning the Honda Classic to start the Florida Swing early this season, the Englishman took it right back in his next outing when he captured the Transitions Championship. … Donald is playing in New Orleans for only the second time, but he took right to TPC Louisiana when he finished in a tie for eighth last year. He opened with a 4-under-par 68 and closed with a 69, finishing five strokes out of the playoff in which Bubba Watson defeated Webb Simpson. That was one of his 14 finishes in the top 10 last year, the most on the PGA Tour. … Donald has had his struggles on the PGA Tour this season, other than his victory in the Transitions and a tie for sixth in the WGC-Cadillac Championship. Since winning the Tampa-area event, he has tied for 32nd in the Masters and tied for 37th in the RBC Heritage, and other than his two top-10s, he has finished outside the top 30 in the other five tournaments he has played. The biggest reason probably is his iron play -- he ranks 137th on the PGA Tour in greens in regulation at 61.67 percent. His short game remains solid. He ranks second in scrambling by getting up-and-down for par 68.12 percent of the time when missing the green and averages 28.40 putts per round.

One recent study found that 93 percent of teens who were getting text messages about their medication said it changed -- for the better -- how they handled their asthma. Automated "robo" calls from pharmacists and doctors with reminders about taking medications and other health-related tips also work better than anything we've used before. Many of these services deliver a patient-education text, and it turns out that kids like to get that, too. But the very best way to improve your son's asthma control is to help him make his own wake-up messages that he programs into his cell phone. (Encourage kids 15 and younger to program their iPod; cell phones aren't great for the developing brain.) Your son can record the reminders, mix in music, set the alarm to deliver them and presto change-o!, you've got a kid who's tuned in to his own asthma control. When kids control the timing and content of their own reminders, they feel independent -- and that lets you relax. The ADEPT study that looked at the benefits of using technology to increase teens' use of their asthma medicine found peer support and musical cues increase adherence to the asthma control routine from 40 percent to 70 percent -- not perfect, but a whole lot better. One more tip, Mom: You can improve your own asthma-control habits, too. Check out your HMO's or pharmacy's automatic call system that reminds you to pick up your son's asthma prescriptions. You'll breathe a lot easier!

I have to agree with the person who lives in Holly Hills. Every night when I walk my dogs, I also hear the dirt bikes racing, and I also wonder where the police are. Last year, we were pulled over on our way to work, going 5 miles per hour over the speed limit because the St. Louis Police Department said they were out looking for racers.

Based at Churchill's peaceful Trackside Training Center, Maker had preferred to leave Hansen in his own barn until right before the race.

A Your small plates or coasters were designed in the 1960s by Piero Fornasetti for Bonwit Teller, a high-end New York department store. The complete set included eight different designs of mythological figures. Fornasetti (1913-1988) made several other coaster sets with different themes for Bonwit Teller. The department store was founded in New York City in 1895 and eventually opened branches in several other cities. After the chain declared bankruptcy in 1989, most of the stores closed.

Strolling around the broad semi-circular corridor that wraps the exhibit halls, I had the profound and appropriate sensation of being in the heavens: A gap between the glass-sided walkway and a softly glowing cloud-white wall underscored the out-of-reachness of the men and women who served in the war as their portraits flashed silently onto the wall and faded away.

Watching this mélange of journalism and dramatic license can be enthralling and maddening at the same time, because the ring of truth, which the film has, is not the same as the truth, which remains unknown. Even small truths that might have been significant -- or not -- have been smoothed over.

That would fit with the overall portrait of the young men as amiable -- and far from devout -- innocents abroad, but, here again, a question of character and motivation is raised yet never answered.

I agree with you, Dan, that the government has chosen to travel down a risky path. I'll address the political risks on Friday, but for now I want to point out that there is a risk in using the bankruptcy process to help resolve GM's problems. Bankruptcy, even if prepackaged and managed by the federal government, is about cutting costs. But GM's biggest problems aren't costs -- and certainly not labor costs, which for GM make up less than 10% of the cost of a car. GM's big problems are quality and innovation. Bankruptcy courts aren't set up to solve those problems.

In May, the audio analysts reported that they could hear someone giving the guard an order to fire. And in October, after a deeper analysis, one of them picked up the sound of four shots that occurred 70 seconds before the guardsmen's volley.

But there is inherent bust-factor risk with wide receivers. Jeffery is the Bears’ highest-drafted wide receiver since Mark Bradley was selected 39th overall out of Oklahoma in 2005.
