I'd tend to think that this is a temporary lull, one that the Yankees should be able to reverse fairly quickly. To be sure, they'd rather have the middle of their order clicking out of the gates.

Snapshot: This deciduous tree adds interest to the garden year-round. In spring, it bears hundreds of large, frilly white flowers that give this popular ornamental tree its nickname. The impressive blooms appear shortly after the first leaves and hold their form for about three weeks. In summer, the attractive green foliage provides shade. In autumn, the leaves turn bright yellow before falling. That reveals the attractive grooved bark, which puts on its own interesting show in winter as it peels. This tree, which tends to grow with multiple trunks, is not fussy, can tolerate all sorts of soils and has no known diseases. You can see specimens in the Arboretum Terrace Garden on the UC Davis campus.

In Greece, cloudy, anise-flavored ouzo, supposedly invented by monks on Mount Athos, is worth a try even if you don’t like the taste of black licorice. Similar to its Mediterranean cousins, French "pastis" and Turkish "raki," ouzo turns from clear to milky white when you add ice or water (don’t drink it straight). Greeks drink it both as an aperitif and with food.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Josh Mandel probably wouldn't mind a George Voinovich comparison right about now -- just not the one made today by well-known political prognosticator Larry Sabato.

And an interesting new class of devices is emerging via Android. Tablets that bring none of the baggage of a legacy desktop app like Windows, and which want to be thought of as a standalone device that never needs the support of a notebook or desktop tether.

If you throw away all expectations of running Windows, you just might have solved 75 percent percent of your problems.

Jake Arrieta became the third straight O's starter to go up in smoke on Tuesday, giving up six earned runs on nine hits over 6 1/3 innings. The only thing positive about it was that he settled down after Hamilton and Beltre hit back-to-back homers in the third inning and worked into the seventh to keep the bullpen from getting stretched out again.

With no idea what was wrong with the car, crew chief Chad Knaus told Johnson to keep dripping oil on the course so he could keep his position if the race was red-flagged. The strategy worked, and the five-time Sprint Cup champions extended their streak to 10 straight top-10 finishes on this track.

It's despicable for the state GOP caucus, especially House Speaker Kurt Zellers, to deliberately torpedo the stadium bill to score some short-lived political brownie points at the expense of losing a professional sports team.

Joe Freeman, The Oregonian: The Rhino was one of the season's biggest enigmas. On the one hand, he seemed to contribute and leave you longing for more every time he played, particularly early in the season. But on the other hand, he could not crack the rotation regardless of whether Nate McMillan or Kaleb Canales was the coach. The Rhino is a loveable character and, in the right situation, a capable player. But his offense is limited outside the paint and his defense is suspect. The Blazers signed him, in part, because their behind-the-scenes "Moneyball" experts loved how his game translated on a computer hard drive. But those numbers did not equate to wins on the court for the Blazers. The Rhino left dissatisfied with his role and playing time in Portland and I expect the sides to part ways.

Romney, along with Jon Huntsman, are skipping the event. Huntsman wrote Iowa off immediately after joining the race.

The 30-year-old financial controller and full-time student at the Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School, will brave the freezing waters with his eight-man team, The Andrew Simons Experience. Moog talked with b about his choice of Plunge wear (no Crocs!) and his un-polar-bear-like diet.

Staving off the growing national debt must be the primary concern of America's public policy makers. While there are small cutbacks that can easily be made, such as privatizing public transportation services, moving towards charter and private schools, and drawing down US military forces abroad, addressing the mounting entitlement problem must occur first. According to research by Duquesne University professor of economics, Antony Davies, the United States could cut every single government program - including foreign aid, defense, education, transportation, housing and urban development, and justice — except for entitlements while still maintaining current tax rates, essentially making it "the world's largest assisted living facility," and the Federal budget would still appear in the red. The numbers do not lie; failing to address entitlements now, creating temporary pain for many Americans, will create unimaginable suffering for future generations. All options must be on the table when working with entitlements, including privatization of retirement services.

Once they discover they actually like it, then they come back and tell other people."

That said, I don't think the risk is too great. YouTube is far different from Napster or Grokster. The core idea of YouTube is that a user creates a work on their own and then shares it online. The thrust of the business is not to encourage anyone to violate copyright, but rather to create works that they then can distribute online. The business model that YouTube features is a far cry from any of the early music file-sharing businesses. That difference in business model should make a big difference in terms of the copyright risk calculus.

On a story like this, though, you can't follow the rules blindly. So at 12:17 p.m. -- long before T.J. Lane was charged but when editors had absolutely no doubt that the 17-year-old was the person who fired the deadly shots -- they posted the name on cleveland.com.

I had two soups, three sandwiches and took a pass on the magnets and needles. The sandwiches were actually pretty good, if not a bit straightforward and dull, like what you had when you visited grandma.

Ritter makes for an engaging lead, and her beleaguered expression as she totes armloads of infant accouterments from car to doorstep says more about the strains of parenthood than anything in her dialogue.

Daniel and his crew arrive early at local farmers' markets and gather fresh kale, chard, dandelion and other dark leafy greens from the farmers. Then they crank up the blenders, swirling the fresh greens with apples, apple juice, flax seed and sometimes bananas.

Find them at the Pacific Beach Tuesday Farmers' Market or North Park Farmers' Market on Thursdays. - Catt White, farmers market manager (Twitter @LIMercato)

Michael Silver, Yahoo! Sports: "Goodell isn't having any appearance of headhunting on his watch, and if you're representing The Shield, you had best wrap your head around this concept. Williams, clearly, hadn't come around as of January – and now he's having what amounts to a very, very severe reality check. He's going to have a long time to think about the line that exists between hyperbole and misbehavior, and he's obviously a poster child for all that ails pro football. Yet the notion that he might have coached his last NFL game is disturbing to me, for many reasons. Chiefly, I believe that he can return from his suspension as an enlightened and repentant force for change who can serve as a powerful example of the New NFL that Goodell and NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith are trying to create."

In the second half, however, Kansas would prove to have more players. There would not be enough of a buttress from a revived William Buford to make up for Deshaun Thomas' missed shots and foul trouble.

The other seven scholarship receivers that should be on the roster in the fall -- two sophomores, three redshirt freshmen and two true freshmen -- have a combined 11 catches for 127 yards and one touchdown. A year ago, there was a lot of uncertainty about who would be the No. 3 receiver behind Posey and Dane Sanzenbacher.

My first experience of this cheese was underwhelming. The texture was supple and pleasant enough, but I could not find much aroma or flavor. Only when I scored a riper wheel, with more give, did I get the mushroom fragrance that others had described, along with a nutty scent; a highly savory, almost meaty flavor; and a sexy, spreadable texture. I couldn't leave that cheese alone.
(On what this process was like with coach Shurmur)- "It was fine, it worked well. We spent a lot of time, obviously, we had a group of guys that we watched over the whole preseason, guys that were possible cut guys.

NFL.com on Winn: "Winn has been a force up front for Boise State for several years. His consistency and ferociousness stays in your memory after watching him play. Although he isn't necessarily great with any one skill or talent, he grades out well because the whole is definitely greater than the sum of his parts. There are hitches in his play that he will need to work on to survive at the next level, such as using technique and adapting to the play speed, but once done Winn should excel.

Lord, the tank at that gas station was the rankest thing I've ever smelled.

"The fact is the Legislature in 2009, early 2010, along with Gov. Corzine, passed a very flawed medical marijuana (law), and we see now how flawed it is ...

Just about all of Southern California's sleepy little beach towns have been built up, priced up and, by many measures, messed up. But San Clemente's pier, beaches and red-tile roofs endure, and they're worth a look. The waves here offer some of North America's best surfing, including the spot known as Trestles (just south of town within San Onofre State Beach), which some people call "the Yosemite of surfing." San Clemente also has an Amtrak stop right by the pier — which raises the tempting idea of a carless beach weekend — and don't forget the beachside pedestrian path that leads north from the pier to a great playground at Linda Lane Park.

Off With Your Head (new in 2011) - Pop and glam rock music show (High Sierra Stage)
The exhibition, organized by Helen Molesworth, chief curator of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, begins promisingly. Or rather, it begins with an installation of works that speak forcefully about broken promises. Front and center stands Krzystof Wodiczko's "Homeless Vehicle," a shopping-cart-cum-missile designed in collaboration with its intended users, meant to provide storage space for redeemable bottles and cans, a sleeping chamber, a wash basin and a conspicuous message about the utter unacceptability of human beings living on the street. Nearby, Adrian Piper's "Calling Cards" rages politely at racist and sexist remarks, handouts given by the artist — a light-skinned black woman — to offending commentators. Everywhere scurry the life-size rats Christy Rupp once printed up as posters, and wheat-pasted in long lines across lower Manhattan. It isn't a pretty picture now, and it wasn't then.

This system splits the engine's power, sending 60% to the rear wheels, and blesses the A6 with an encouraging degree of grip.

"Most states in the West have also gained domestic migrants in the 2000s, with the exceptions of Alaska, Hawaii and California. California is the real story in the West, having lost nearly 1.5 million domestic migrants, a population greater than that of the city of San Diego. In 2000, California lost nearly 100,000 domestic migrants and for the fourth year in a row led the nation in net domestic out-migration. This includes 2006, when not even Louisiana's catastrophic hurricanes could drive as many people away as California. During the first year of the decade, California lost only 45,000 net domestic migrants. By 2007, as the center of the worldwide housing bubble, California's losses were 7 times that amount. In 2009, even with depressed migration rates associated with the recession, out migration more than doubled between 2001 and 2009.

I hear Thomas's exasperation again, but this time even more weighed down with anxiety and sorrow. "What do you mean we know where you're going? We don't, as a matter of fact, so how can we know the way to get there?" Perhaps the other disciples were thinking it, but it is Thomas who speaks up and contradicts what Jesus has just told them. It's a bold move, but as I said, I think Thomas was hardwired for telling the plain truth. And the truth was, he didn't know. He didn't understand. This leads Jesus to make a declaration on which the hope of Christians everywhere rests:

In most cases, the fuel-economy improvements are fairly small. The automatic Civic, for example, gets 30.5 miles per gallon, only half a mile per gallon more than the manual version.

He is a little small, yes, but David shined the brightest against the best talent in football last year. Consider the following: Against Michigan, 17 tackles, 2½ for a loss. Against Wisconsin, three tackles for loss and two sacks. Against Ohio State, 13 tackles and a forced fumble. David is tough to pin down and although he will be glazed over completely by some teams schematically, he will be a steal in the second round for a team needing a solid weak side linebacker.

Well, the one bill that could have created thousands of them, many in the St. Louis region, was the victim of the annual internecine battle between the House and Senate that holds up progress at the price of politics. The bill would have created tax incentives to help turn Lambert-St. Louis International Airport into a hub for freight traffic from China and other countries. Those incentives, if successful, would have brought construction jobs to the city immediately, followed by manufacturing, warehouse and other ancillary employment.

Mr. Baldwin's descriptive gifts are so good that it is hard not to wish that he had saved up a little money, quit his advertising gig and simply gone out into the city more, wandering the streets like a flâneur; that he had done more to meet Parisians where they actually hang out—that he'd eaten fewer meals from Picard. Eventually, Rachel, ever more unhappy, says to him: "We had a dream of living abroad. We accomplished it. What about your professional dreams? What about mine? I don't think they'll happen if we stay in Paris." And Mr. Baldwin agrees. "That was it," he writes, "the truth." If only, for the sake of Mr. Baldwin's account, they had stuck it out a little longer.

Some of the nation’s greatest schools, such as Ohio State and the University of Kansas, pride themselves in accepting students from a wide range of backgrounds. Their job, as they see it, is to serve both the elite and the non-elite. They provide a superb education, and their reputations are second to none.

"Nature created humans as omnivores. We have the physical equipment for omnivory, from teeth to guts. We have extraordinary needs for nutrients not found in plants. They include fully formed vitamins A and D, vitamin B12, and the long-chain fatty acids found in fish,” explains Nina Planck, author of "The Farmer's Market Cookbook," on the New York Times' Room For Debate. She continues: "For babies and children, whose nutritional needs are extraordinary, the risks are definite and scary. The breast milk of vegetarian and vegan mothers is dramatically lower in a critical brain fat, DHA, than the milk of an omnivorous mother and contains less usable vitamin B6. Carnitine, a vital amino acid found in meat and breast milk, is nicknamed 'vitamin Bb' because babies need so much of it." And she concludes: "You may choose to be a vegan. Your baby doesn't have that luxury. Let her grow up omnivorous and healthy. Then watch her exercise her own freedom of choice with justifiable pride."
