Asked to account for the fascination over his parents' wedding so many decades later, Bogart, whose gravelly voice uncannily resembles his father's, said, "It was one of the great romances of the 20th century. People actually saw them falling in love on the set of 'To Have and Have Not.' Watch that film today, and you can still see the chemistry between them."
He made no pretense of his intentions: He was a public writer — one who directly addressed some of the most vexing issues of his day.

Republicans planned to make up the loss in tax revenues by borrowing $43.5 million from state budget reserves, a move Dayton and many Democrats said was irresponsible when the state faces a shortfall.

In a new study, Harvard researchers say they have found stem cells in women that can be used to grow new eggs.

Time was, during Republican James Rhodes' governorships (1963-71, 1975-83), when new GOP talent wasn't really brought along. Now, with Batchelder's House caucus and a set of Republican statewide elected executive officers ranging in age from 33 (Treasurer Josh Mandel) to 64 (Attorney General Mike DeWine, a former lieutenant governor and U.S. senator), Republicans have a deep bench.

Those who score well enough to stick with the league make some nice change. NFL officials are paid about $70,000 to $180,000, depending on their experience, plus travel and lodging expenses and a health-club allowance to help them (try to) keep up with high-test athletes crashing into 300-pounders and running 4.5 40s. Plus, each season they need to pass specific body-fat measures that vary by age and officiating position.

Now, Wade and Allen are two of the most selfless players you're going find in the NBA in terms of hard work, so criticizing them as selfish might be going a bit far. If they do play in London this summer, they're not going to go half speed. And they also know that playing outside of the NBA--even if they are insured--puts them at risk domestically. They don't even have to get injured to hurt themselves for the 2012-2013 NBA season. The simple act of skipping what would otherwise be a restful period is a risk in itself.

I am glad to see the Sunpaper via Tim Wheeler has again cast some light on the gas/Marcellus shale exploration and land leasing problems in the western part of our state ("Second thoughts on gas leasing," Jan. 1). It should come as no surprise to us that the drilling operators and contractors refuse to reveal the down side of their operations or the shortcomings of their property leases; one has only to look at our neighbors to the north and what has happened to their water supplies, their roads and streams. If one needs more proof, then look to parts of Texas and Wyoming. It enough to cause us to unleash the dogs when we see a leasing agent at our door.

President Bill Clinton took it a decisive step further. Without gaining statutory permission, he authorized his staff to issue policy directives to the rest of the executive branch. After the Democrats lost Congress in 1994, Clinton used these new powers to maximum effect. He typically went into the pressroom himself to announce his staff's regulatory initiatives with great fanfare. By directing the bureaucracy to implement his program, he could make an end-run around Congress, but at a grave risk to the rule of law. As Elena Kagan put it when she was a Harvard law professor: "Presidents, more than agency officials acting independently, tend to push the envelope when interpreting statutes" -- generating a tendency toward "lawlessness."

Without NJN’s eagle eye, we can’t watch our legislators in action, read their body language or be privy to their innuendo. Gov. Chris Christie and the legislators have rendered us vulnerable to their back-room whims. And how much of that “savings to the state” will we see? The lines of communication have been cut, and we taxpayers are left to pay the bill — in more ways than one!

The agent, who represents many NFL stars, also compared Pryor to Cam Newton, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft. Some prognosticators have suggested Pryor may not be worth more than a fourth- or fifth-round pick in the supplemental draft, in which teams would have to forfeit a parallel round choice in the 2012 draft by making a selection. Others have speculated that Pryor may be better served changing positions.

Finspiration 1: Make it a family thing. Do the kids start wriggling if you suggest fish for dinner? Take 'em along to the fish counter: If they pick it, they'll try it. Start with mild types: sole, flounder, tilapia, shrimp. Season with whatever your crew finds yummy. Garlic, white wine and sun-dried tomatoes usually do great. Or lemon juice and cracked pepper, or marinara sauce over whole-wheat pasta. No go? Switch recipes and keep at it. It can take multiple tries before some kids (adults, too) like any new food.

Aleppo bears watching in part because it remains the country's last firm Assad stronghold. Even Damascus, Syria's capital, has become a regular hub of protests, where the opposition has mustered some quiet support from the crucial business and middle classes that traditionally support the Assad regime.

When choosing an olive oil, smell it first. "You want "a strong, fresh, lively smell," says Lawrence. "Pay attention to the mouth feel," she says, "You want it to be crisp and fresh." When you taste the oil, don't be afraid of peppery and pungent flavors. "This is what you want," she says. Your choice of oil depends on your taste buds, and how you plan to use it.

A milder, late harvest, olive oil won't overwhelm fish or chicken. You can indeed cook with olive oil. Choose one with a higher polyphenol count because it has a lower smoke point. Color is not an important factor, nor is clarity. "Sediment is not bad," Lawrence says.

One wonders if back-lighting the characters during these interludes, viewing them in silhouette behind curtains, might have been effective in maintaining the audience’s interest while upholding a veneer of mystery about the injured.

If social Darwinism is merely the belief that the market is the best system for allocating capital and wealth and that a free society will necessarily be an unequal one, then almost everyone in America is a social Darwinist. Even the president constantly pledges fealty to the market and doesn't want to confiscate all of Mark Zuckerberg's income. He is using social Darwinism as a free-floating pejorative for people whose policy preferences he doesn't like, which is entirely appropriate.

The Orange overcame off-court distractions to finish the regular season at 30-1, before falling in the semifinals of the Big East Tournament. This may be Jim Boeheim’s deepest team — they’re deep enough to have second-leading scorer Dion Waiters come off the bench.

Although there are two dozen restaurants in downtown Paso Robles, the foodie network suggests that two stand out. Artisan is a newcomer whose opening has generated a buzz. Chef Chris Kobayashi was at Robin's in Cambria, where he produced terrific "global" cuisine, which means he cooked whatever took his fancy. But he turned that vine-wrapped old house into a destination. At Artisan he's thinking lofty: venison Wellington and steak with Cabernet butter. The décor is West Hollywood minimalist beige and black. I order the cornbread, which is shaped like pinky fingers. It comes with lavender honey butter and tastes like a delicious cloud. There are three wine flights to choose from, and I opt for a trio of reds that includes a hefty Cabernet Sauvignon from Justin, one of the region's celebrities.

There always has been praise. Praise since a professor at Vassar called her acting "mind-boggling," praise since her drama-school days at Yale, where she gave herself an ulcer playing 40 stage roles in three years (Brecht, Weill, Shakespeare, Durang).

It got a little lost in the end-of-year awards-bait shuffle, but "War Horse," the epic adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's novel (and Nick Stafford's play), is one of director Steven Spielberg's best films: a rousing, David Lean- and John Ford-inspired World War I story about a horse that gets passed from owner to owner across a ravaged Europe. The filmmaking is old-fashioned — and more family-friendly than hard-hitting — but the cast includes a who's who of top contemporary British actors, including Peter Mullan, Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Marsan and Toby Kebbell, and the fable-like nature of the equine hero's odyssey gradually becomes a tear-jerker of the first order. "War Horse" deserves to become a belated hit on DVD and Blu-ray (where viewers can also find a healthy assortment of well-made behind-the-scenes featurettes). Available on VOD April 3.

If it's a Friday afternoon, you can enjoy listening to traditional Hawaiian slack key music by the Pone Kane Trio, which plays the indigenous guitar and ukulele sound originally composed to accompany hula. It's hauntingly evocative of the islands, unembellished by yodeling or any other kind of singing, certainly not the kind involving tiny bubbles, little fish with big names or ukulele ladies, although if you ask them nicely, they might play a slack key version of "Puff the Magic Dragon."

"He can't win by out-spending your opponent ten to one, he can't win by beating him up, he can't win by getting all the media to say the race is over, maybe try to just argue mathematics, that it's inevitable," Santorum said.

This summer, Flanagan and Goucher are both eager to recapture their medal glory in the 10,000. Daegu, like Osaka (in 2007) and Beijing, has a reputation for being hot and sticky, issues that make running a marathon there unappealing.

A mercurial force, Bryzgalov unraveled in the third. He took Philadelphia with him on a night Jaromir Jagr admitted they had no legs. It was the goaltender who was the difference between a blowout early on and their razor-thin 1-0 lead.

Vancouver B.C., isn't so far away from Portland that we can't head up on the train or in the car for a brief getaway, but if you could fly instead -- cutting your travel time significantly -- you'd have even more of your long weekend to spend enjoying the city.

One of the biggest issues we all face each day, whether at home or out to eat, is controlling our portion sizes. Let us compare 1950s portion sizes to present; soda went from 7 ounces up to 64 ounces, a chocolate bar went from 1 ounce up to 8 ounces, and a hamburger patty went from 1.6 ounces up to 8 ounces. What is the common trend here? These portion sizes didn't just double they increased by up to 900 percent ... sounds like some of our waistlines, huh? Controlling this issue alone will make significant contributions to your weight lose goals. That's easy to say, but how do we know what a portion size looks like? Personally, I am into many sports so I compare what I eat to common game balls; where a 1/4 cup of beans would be a golf ball, 3 ounces of meat would be a hockey puck, a 1/2 cup of fruit would be a tennis ball, and a cup of pasta or vegetables would be a baseball. Following these rules should help you control your portions without all the "high tech" measuring equipment. What do we put in these cups?

Jeff sends the tribes (men - Manona, women - Salani) off in two directions to eventually meet up at the same place. The men learn just how heavy carrying water can be, and the women are already strategerizing and forming alliances.

Most famous around the clubhouse though is when Inge takes the field before batting practice in a dome.

That's important because, in Philadelphia, Gehry would carve out the area under the terrace to create a new suite of high-ceilinged galleries for the museum's extensive contemporary art collection. The rooms in the historic beaux arts building simply aren't tall enough for the likes of Joseph Beuys' famous Lightning With Stag in its Glare, a sculpture that has been on loan to MASS MoCA in North Adams, Mass., for years.
It pretty much always has been. After a few odd but helpful breaks — he directed the Yes concert film, “9012Live” — Soderbergh got James Spader to sign on for “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” a story of sexual dysfunction and emotional withdrawal. Not the usual recipe for a hit first feature, but it won raves at Cannes and Sundance, and established the 25-year-old director as Hollywood’s next big thing.
At the same time, fading Republican contender Newt Gingrich signaled that he would likely follow Rick Santorum out of the race and called on the GOP to unite behind Romney. Aides confirmed that Gingrich will leave the race next week and said he was likely to endorse his one-time rival.

It's not quite the frenzied Carnival spirit of Rio, but it's easy to imagine that you're partying at a Brazilian seaside resort. Most diners, though, aren't here for the view.

Opening Days and baseball used to be for kids - and grown-ups who never really grew up - and knothole gangs, not corporations.

Ray Ratto, CBSSports.com: "Within 24 hours, we got an Ozzie Guillen filibuster on the tricky nature of thinking in one tongue and talking in another, and then a written mea maxima culpa from Petrino, whose reputation was already sort of a rolling port-a-potty before he took himself out for that late-night scrape. And we graded them both as though they were kabuki theatre. For the most part, Guillen did well. For the most part, Petrino did not. People could believe Guillen spoke without thinking because he is so practiced at it. Nobody could believe Petrino's attempt at sincerity because he is so demonstrably poor at it. And he didn't say anything about his cell phone graphics. That part, if true, is going to be harder for a recruit's parents to endure."

Pepin would occasionally pop into a classroom, slapping us on the backs, loudly asking us about our progress. Passot is cut from the same cloth.

The site is dominated by the remains of the grand public buildings around the forum, with the impressive arches of the Basilica courthouse arrayed in front of pillars of the temple to the god Jupiter - now topped by bushy stork nests.

The only other bone I'd pick is that this season's plots seemed a little hard to follow at times. I had to watch the first episode, "A Scandal in Belgravia," twice, and I still don't understand all of it.

Many people with such documents suffer nothing worse than anxiety. One answer, then, would be more stringent medical requirements for medical pot, not to send paramilitary officials into peaceful businesses. The best answer would be to eliminate the sham altogether by legalizing marijuana, which would provide a tax windfall and take a bite out of the Mexican drug cartel profits. It's not as if pot smokers can't easily buy marijuana on the black market.

The CQ Press ranking takes into account a city's per-capita incidence of six serious crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor-vehicle theft. For each crime, the editors calculate how each city's rate differs from the national average. These six percentage differences are averaged to produce an overall score, and then cities are ranked by that score, which, roughly speaking, represents the difference between a city's rate of serious crime and the national rate.

Written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, "A Separation" moves swiftly from that contentious opening scene to the more muted and tragic business of Simin's departure from their home in Tehran. She leaves with barely a word to her husband and daughter, Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). Her senile father-in-law (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi) grabs her arm and won't let go, a rare moment of mutual silent understanding between two of the film's most important - and least-communicative - figures.

It turns out that "identity theft" is one of the most brilliant linguistic constructs ever, with its terrifying specter of losing not just your money – but your soul. Maybe it's time that we renamed it what it is: a fear campaign designed to get us to buy expensive services that we don't need.

Alexander Semin, who had three goals for Washington in its first-round upset of defending Stanley Cup champion Boston, skated as a fourth-liner Sunday after he took two penalties in the series-opening loss to the Rangers.

"Delicacy" is not a film of sweeping melodrama, political thrills or witty banter. It is, pure and simple, the story of a beautiful woman who finds her way back from crushing grief. It's charming, and seems out of place at the box office, like a lone subtle sweet in a box of See's Candy.
