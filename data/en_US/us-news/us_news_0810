Throughout this period, our troop levels in Afghanistan remained a fraction of what they were in Iraq. When I took office, we had just over 32,000 Americans serving in Afghanistan, compared to 160,000 in Iraq at the peak of the war. Commanders in Afghanistan repeatedly asked for support to deal with the reemergence of the Taliban, but these reinforcements did not arrive. That's why, shortly after taking office, I approved a long-standing request for more troops. After consultations with our allies, I then announced a strategy recognizing the fundamental connection between our war effort in Afghanistan, and the extremist safe-havens in Pakistan. I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian effort.

The heavy lake effect snow in northern Indiana was part of a slow-moving storm that has been crawling across the Midwest since Friday night.

The old media enable this trend. A competitive news environment drives saturation coverage. Saturation coverage confers legitimacy -- even as reporters themselves feel guilty in their complicity.

In your editorial on the Republican reaction to President Obama's jobs plan ("Let them eat tax cuts," Sept. 12), why give a snide remark about House Speaker John Boehner playing golf? Mr Obama has played more in the last two and a half years than I have, and I am retired and my kids are out of house. I couldn't afford the time to play golf when my kids were his age — not the money but the time investment. He must be either cutting us or his kids short (and seems to be us).

Our enchanted bench is manipulated by a robotic arm that moves along a track while animatronic objects move around us and computer-generated scenes are projected on a 360-degree screen.

History suggests that deregulation isn't the answer, either. As it affected the airlines in the late 1970s, deregulation served mainly to create shareholder value by decreasing the compensation of pilots, flight attendants and airline mechanics. As it affected the trucking industry a few years later, it led to mass terminations coupled with (vastly) increased workloads for the few drivers fortunate enough to keep their jobs.

In fact, there is already a successful (but largely ignored) model for the evaluation of clinical data by an independent laboratory. In a two-year pilot program that lasted from 1992 to 1994, the FDA contracted out reviews of supplements to new drug applications and compared the results of these evaluations to in-house analyses. In all five of the supplements reviewed by a nonprofit technical consulting company, the recommendations were congruent with the FDA's own actions, and the process was faster and cheaper.

For those desiring a precise definition of pitch to contact, start with this: a pitcher who is trying to get hitters to put the ball in play, preferably on the ground, within three pitches.

The goal is to sell them at around $45 per share, the same price at which private shareholders can exercise warrants to buy more shares over the next 10 years.

"Whitney" (9:30 p.m., KGW, 9/22): Whitney Cummings co-created the promising "2 Broke Girls." But here she plays a comedy version of herself, and things don't go so well. The idea, apparently, is to explore the "happily unmarried" state of Whitney and her boyfriend, Alex (Chris D'Elia).

Whether the cause is a condition such as diabetes, heart disease or preeclampsia, complications during childbirth can require a delicate medical balancing act with high levels of specialized care. And choosing the right physician and hospital is paramount.
problem in the short term is where to play everyone. Miguel Cabrera is an indifferent first baseman, but is probably a better option there than Fielder. Delmon Young shouldn't be allowed to play the outfield, and even if he was, the Tigers might prefer to play Ryan Raburn and Brennan Boesch in the corners since Young walks about twice a month. They could put Raburn at second and Young in left, Cabrera at third and just punt defense entirely, hoping to bludgeon opponents into submission, although I wouldn't recommend it. Playing Fielder at first and Cabrera at third would be defensive self-immolation. The best solution might be to have Fielder and Cabrera share time at first base to keep both bats in the lineup as often as possible, since the risk of knee problems for, um, ‘husky' players is probably tied not just to age but to time standing at a position."
And the players want us to believe that they're the victims in some real-life sequel to "Norma Rae." That they're valiant oppressed workers, standing up to the evil barons of big business.

Such a huge drop in price would certainly increase use. But no one knows by how much because no modern country has experienced prices that low. Taxes could not come close to maintaining prohibition-level prices without being undercut by a "gray" market. Indeed, tobacco-tax evasion is already a serious issue in the U.S., where the average state tax is a few dollars a pack, and a pack of cigarettes weighs just about an ounce. By comparison, an ounce of high-quality marijuana now sells for about $300.

Over the past two weeks, Charles Murray's book, "Coming Apart," has restarted the social disruption debate. But, judging by the firestorm, you would have no idea that the sociological and psychological research of the past 25 years even existed.

Oil and gasoline prices began a steady rise in February, as the Libyan rebellion shut down the country's daily exports of 1.5 million barrels of oil. Libya produces about 2 percent of world demand, and analysts say making up for those losses will severely reduce the ability of other oil-producing countries to increase production in the future. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries are covering some of the shortfall in Libyan crude, which went mainly to refineries in Europe.
TOM CRUISE
"It is unconscionable to be spending public dollars on this project that makes no economic sense, that serves so few people, and is basically putting money into the pockets of Homer Williams and his firm, the Obletz firm, and making a name for a few public officials," said Dunthorpe resident Elizabeth English, whose property abuts the right of way.

Returning to our main course, the GS 350 is best judged from the driver's seat, or anywhere else in the excellent cabin. Lexus should be commended for its latest contribution to the sports sedan ethos. Yet step outside and view the car, and that coherence dissolves. Passion involves focus and risk, both of which the GS needs more of. But it's better than Grape-Nuts.
"As a Giant running back, it’s one of the toughest things,” Bradshaw said. "I don’t see a lot of guys coming in and being able to grasp all of the different things you can do as a running back. You just have so many pass protections, so many pass route terms, so many run terms. You have different terminology from when you’re in college or when you’re with another team. It’s just so much different terminology with us and then we have so many keywords and hidden phrases. Different teams won’t know exactly what you’re doing every game. It’s kind of tough.

That's when Mike Thompson said he came close to making a substantial investment in the currency program, which he had learned about through the Worldwide Christian Radio shortwave network.

Idaho Falls and Boise are hardly Hollywood or Wall Street for political fund-raising. But in part because of VanderSloot, Romney raised $404,000 in Idaho in 2011, four and a half times more than Obama, and 19 times more than Gingrich.
Duquette said the tear apparently occurred after Wada had his physical in December and before last week — though it wasn't thought to be the source of the elbow soreness that hindered Wada early in the spring.

Manning also reportedly prefers to play in the AFC, where he is more familiar with the defenses and where he wouldn't have to deal with the spectacle of playing brother Eli as often. The 49ers faced the Giants twice last season and will meet in 2012.
Look, I recognize that most of the Republicans in Congress have said no to just about every policy I've proposed since taking office. And on some issues, I realize it's because there are genuine philosophical differences. But on issues like this one, the only reason they're holding this up is politics, pure and simple. They're making the same calculation they made just before the inauguration: if I fail, they win. Well, they might think this will get them where they need to go in November, but it won't get our country where it needs to go in the long run.
Because of recent redistricting, Finter is just getting to know the area himself, he said. He was initially struck by the area's challenges, including 60- to 80-year-old buildings, antiquated utilities and an older demographic.

First things first, though, and adding some luster to the Gator Bowl is the Urban Meyer story. Ohio State has hired Meyer as its new coach. He was Florida's coach from 2005-10, leading the Gators to national championships in the 2006 and 2008 seasons. Meyer stepped down from Florida with time left on his Gators' contract, citing health concerns and a desire to spend more time with his family.

"It is very important that our trees are protected -- and it's extremely difficult for individuals to protect their trees, especially when they're up against large developers," Blair said.

The BETC program is slated to sunset in 2012, halfway through the coming biennium, though the impact of outstanding credits on state revenue will continue for years. Meanwhile, legislators were offered plenty of testimony Tuesday on why the program should be extended until the budget recovers. The debate is shaping up as a contest between conservation, the traditional focus of the credits, and renewable energy projects, which have driven growth in the program since it was expanded in 2007.

On April 17, I will be protesting war taxes at Baltimore's main post office. I realize that taxes fund many good programs — education, environment and diplomacy.

Pakistan has a far more advanced military, but civilian leaders opted for peace treaties that were little more than attempts at appeasement. They have now been abandoned in favor of a military response, largely at Washington's urging.

"Let that process move through," Showalter said of Bell. "He could still be with us and we still like the potential he has. It's just the need of our organization for someone like Exposito. That's really what it came down to. And I'm sure there were other people, Dan and the front office considered. It's not like we're moving on from Josh. We're hoping he gets through and that he continues to be someone with some upside for us. We'll see how everyone perceives him now."

And we can do a better job as scientists in helping people see where our research fits into those debates."

Obama "isn't going to get a lot of growth from Europe, and there may be more bad headlines" on the debt crisis, said Jacob Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

"If she buys me this car today, it'll prove that she loves me." Kara, 16, of Jeana.
Shaelee was a deep thinker with a very tender heart. She hated injustice and, in particular, she was sensitive to those who were left out or forgotten. Because of the behavioral manifestations of her disease, she knew what it felt like to be the "odd person out." Thus, one of her finest qualities was her ability to relate to -- and champion -- those who were different, or marginalized. She cared not one wit about the color of one's skin, the texture of one's hair, the disability of her Down syndrome preschool classmate Laura Lou, or the unusual style of her autistic cousin Jeremy. And she was very protective of those to whom she was loyal, including God.
