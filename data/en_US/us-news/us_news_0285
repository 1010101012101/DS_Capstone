"I was so surprised by our Saratogans," Jin said of the previous planning commission discussion about the project. "Are we so selfish and so self-centered? All they were talking about is 'me' and 'I.' They were not concentrating on the major benefit we are getting out of this project."

As our good members of Congress debate budget cuts in order to raise the debt ceiling, I just discovered why debating the elimination of the Bush tax cuts are a no-go. Almost half of the members —261, to be exact — are millionaires. If the vote comes up to tax individuals making over $200,000 or families making over $250,000 — the top 2 percent of income earners — just how do you think that's going to go? They are among the wealthiest people in America. These figures don't even include federal financial disclosures that don't require members of Congress to report certain assets such as personal residences. The House vote expected Tuesday centers on a GOP plan known as "cut, cap, and balance." I guess as long as they don't cut any of their money it's OK?

It's rare to find such a friendly, unpretentious crew, although that doesn't excuse training lapses such as a server holding the bowl of the wineglass as he delivered a glass of wine to a customer.

Every week or so, you'll see a local news story involving trouble with prescription drugs.

In a Q&A panel presented as a DVD extra, Schnabel (who also directed "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly") and Jebreal maintain that there is an organized effort to discredit the film. In DVD commentary, Schnabel defends his film as an Arab-Israeli collaboration; occasionally, he says, young Palestinian men were called upon to play members of the Israeli Army, and vice versa. Schnabel filmed the orphanage scenes at the real-life home of al-Husseini, and the rape scene in the very room of the house where it occurred. When Al Massri proved to be afraid of the water while filming her death scene, Jebreal donned an identical dress and trod into the ocean, effectively reenacting the suicide of her own mother.

We are also listing the top plain chocolates, and the top baking chocolates; for them, a perfect score would be 100.

Directed by actor-director Baltasar Kormakur, the film has a gloomy, propulsive, working-class energy that feels slightly more like European cinema than Hollywood.

But when his wife's younger brother, Andy, winds up in hock to a volatile drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris is forced to take up his old ways to pay off the debt and to keep Andy from being shot in the head.

Colonies of pharaoh ants usually contain many nests, and it is essential to control all of them or you will never get rid of them. Never use synthetic pesticides in trying to control these ants as all you will do is cause them to split up and you will make the problem worse.

Place the bait-filled straws as close to the nests as possible.

Why hasn't the K-12 budget been restored to the 2007-2009 level?

It was the attraction of the job. Portland was attractive to me, but when the job was offered to me, I asked myself ‘How can I turn this around?’ I’m thinking the effort we would have to put into it, and the first guy who came to mind was Luke.’’

3. WHAT'S EATING COLBY RASMUS?: It was probably the biggest news story of the second half of the season as Joe Strauss, the Big Kahuna of baseball writers, reported that center fielder Rasmus had requested a trade during the season. Rasmus' restlessness was obvious, but that it reached a breaking point for the kid slugger was striking. What followed was a denial that sucked in some outlets and then, later, a potential reconciliation, one that still seems wobbly. Rasmus and La Russa each insist they can get along. Spring training will offer the first caucus. There was a subplot, however, that was just as interesting. With pointed comments, Pujols interjected himself into the squabble and expressed that Rasmus should be happy or move on ("You never know with him," Pujols said). That same day and again later, Pujols pulled Rasmus aside for some lengthy talks. According to both players, they were not one-way conversations. Rasmus later described how he felt the clubhouse open up to him after those conversations. What could have turned sour and left a young, talented player frozen out and packaged for a move may prove to be a turning point. That remains to be seen. What's clear is Rasmus' potential. His .859 OPS led all center fielders who had enough plate appearances at the position to qualify for the batting title, and that is worth keeping around.
* One of the comical things I continue to hear - and it came up on the Fox Network broadcast Saturday, during the Pujols Slobberfest - is that the Cardinals reacted to losing Pujols by overpaying Molina. The Cardinals supposedly needed to save face with the fans and did so by lavishing riches on Molina. Right. This, of course, is insulting to Molina because it implies that he didn't deserve the new five-year, $75 million deal that kicks in next season. This implies that he got the money because the Cardinals had to do something to score points with the fans - as if Molina is Jason Bay and the Cardinals were the Mets. It's laughable. The Cardinals paid Molina the big money because - as Tony La Russa and John Mozeliak have said - he's their one irreplaceable player. He is a lot more than just a catcher, and the people who still don't get it need to talk to the pitchers, to Molina's teammates.
Loyd says he's done nothing wrong, adding that he's a victim himself of the real estate crash.

Peyton Manning doesn't run very often or very well, but here he came, escaping pressure, rolling right, frenetically pounding with his heavy-footed stride toward the sideline, where he was hammered out of bounds by defensive tackle Monsanto Pope.
Three top Ficano aides -- Azzam Elder, Mullin and Schenk -- were offered even more. Letters obtained by the Free Press show the three were allowed to include severance payments, equal to two weeks' pay for each year of service, in their final year's salary for pension calculations -- a boost that will increase their retirement income for the rest of their lives.
During the 2004 presidential campaign, John Kerry received much derision for his belief (as expressed in a Jan. 29 debate in South Carolina) that although the war on terror will be "occasionally military," it is "primarily an intelligence and law enforcement operation that requires cooperation around the world." Kerry, as paraphrased by The New York Times Magazine of Oct. 10, thought "many of the interdiction tactics that cripple drug lords, including governments working jointly to share intelligence, patrol borders and force banks to identify suspicious customers, can also be some of the most useful tools in the war on terror." True then; even more obviously true now.
Several days later, the Elkton police department, acting on a warrant for the woman's medical record, found a freezer with about 35 late-term fetuses. Elkton police didn't immediately return a telephone message Friday night.
Spread out below us was an eye-boggling scene you'd never find amid the bustle of Waikiki: A lush, 21-acre layout with a man-made river, volcanolike outcropping and a massive swimming pool.

Hugo gives Isabelle what Scorsese would consider the greatest gift -- he sneaks her into a movie. Georges has forbidden her from seeing them, so it is her first time. And when Hugo finishes the repair of the automaton, a trip to the library and a run-in with a film historian (Michael Stuhlbarg) leads them to a shocking discovery that solves the many mysteries of the film, but also opens up another chapter: Scorsese recreates the creation of motion pictures, and it is every bit as magical as the people making them believe it to be.
Through it all, Rick Ayres said he had often wondered why his daughter visited other friends and family in their dreams, but not him. They’d spent years together inside that baby blue-and-white Bronco driving from one tournament to the next, their personalities becoming one extension of the other.

Milestones included putting the Hubble telescope in orbit in 1990, then returning in 1997 to repair it -- a mission that set the altitude record for space shuttles. It flew the first Russian cosmonaut on a U.S. mission; was the first shuttle to rendezvous with the Russian space station, Mir; carried the oldest space flier aloft -- Sen. John Glenn; and was the first shuttle flown by a female pilot.
"I don't know if this (latest charge) would cause anyone to change their minds, but I would not support it," he said. "He hasn't been indicted himself, and the person who's accused of taking the bribe is low enough down that they didn't have any direct contact with Bob."

Several scientists not involved in the project said they were simultaneously thrilled and wary, calling the plan daring, difficult -- and very pricey. They don't see how it could be cost-effective, even with platinum and gold worth nearly $1,600 an ounce. An upcoming NASA mission to return just 2 ounces (60 grams) of an asteroid to Earth will cost about $1 billion.

Emmerton followed up at 15:33, blocking a shot by Kevin Klein and carrying the puck into Nashville's zone. There he did exactly what Mike Babcock has preached: Just throw the puck on net. Why preach that? Because sometimes even a Vezina Trophy-caliber goaltender gives a little, like Rinne, who let the shot get by high stick-side.
Jones told The Republic that a Shadow Mountain employee said that Morris was using a truck purchased with district funds for personal reasons. Jones said he asked district officials about the claim but got no response.

Not everyone is so intimidated. Givens and Crowder are pushing hard against Quarles for different reasons and Limehouse, one of the other devils on the loose, doesn't have much use for him either. Limehouse is busy gathering intel and planting spies and hasn't done anything really nasty in his butcher shop yet, a situation that won't last longer than another week or two. Arlo Givens found himself on the wrong side of Limehouse, and Crowder can't decide if he's a friend or an enemy of the leader of Nobles Holler.

Under the new approach, the Fed would print new money to buy long-term mortgage or Treasury bonds but effectively tie up that money by borrowing it back for short periods at low rates. The aim of such an approach would be to relieve anxieties that money printing could fuel inflation later, a fear widely expressed by critics of the Fed's previous efforts to aid the recovery.

Will Sheff of Okkervil River released a hardcover book version of the lyrics to "I Am Very Far." That he's proud of his lyrics is nothing new -- he has been, for the past decade, one of the most accomplished wordsmiths in pop music, a man in love with assonance and the percussive sounds of consonants in sequence. But what he can really crow about this time are the melodies he's written and the dense, complex arrangements he's crafted around them. What was once a fairly conservative folk-rock outfit has turned into an experimental one: On a few tracks, two bands actually play at once, which is a heck of a way to achieve a chorus effect. (At other times, it sounds like Sheff is singing through the resonation chamber of an old spinet.) Sheff used to come out from the mixes and shake hands with the listener; now, he's hiding behind trees in the forest at twilight. Since every step he takes is carefully planned, his misdirection pays its dividends in emotional resonance.

IJ argues: The 10th Amendment forbids Congress from exercising its commerce power to compel states to enter into contractual relations by effectively forcing states to “buy” radioactive waste. Hence “the power to regulate commerce does not include the power to compel a party to take title to goods or services against its will.” And if it is beyond Congress’ power to commandeer the states by compelling them to enter into contracts, it must likewise be beyond Congress’ power to commandeer individuals by requiring them to purchase insurance. Again, the 10th Amendment declares that any powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states or to the people.

Desserts stray a bit from the Roman theme to include profiteroles ($6.50), cream puffs commonly found on French menus. Here the golf-ball-size rounds are filled with custard and topped with a dark chocolate sauce, but the puffs' flavor is too strong. The creamy lemon tart ($6.50) is better. The bright slice looks like a mountain peak with the flurry of white chocolate shaved on top.

The first man at bat as they went into the last inning was Mike Kreevich, the most dangerous hitter in the Sox line-up. He took two balls, then a strike, then fouled off one before he hoisted a towering in-field fly. It came to rest in Ray Mack’s hands for the first out and a tremendous roar went up from the crowd, which by this time left no doubt that it was rooting for Feller, not the Sox.
"Forget that I'm on my last chance with every job - this is my family, this is my life. That's the severity of this. What's been amazing is the support of the people (in the recovery program), people who two months ago I didn't know and some of them (are) some of the greatest people you'd ever want to meet.

But even on Friday against the Royals, Jimenez rarely rocked the radar at 95 and never edged past that, which is where his pitches once lived. That was one of the issues critics of the trade raised.

We had the opportunity to watch the restaurant work and to spend a lot of time in Detroit. We basically fell in love with Detroit and just thought what a great city and what a great story. The story of Detroit and the story of Small Plates kind of are running in parallel paths. It's like a microcosm of Detroit in the sense that it was once great, fell on hard times and is now having kind of a rebirth.

Similarly, but with somewhat fewer millions of dollars, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, chaired by John Ensign of Nevada, has attacked Merkley as a witless rube who loves nothing more than to rob hardworking Oregonians of their money.

But the Wizards have an odd problem when it comes to Lewis—they don’t have any other players who are making much money. If they cut Lewis, they will have about $18.5 million in salary on their books, and the new CBA will require teams to spend at least 85 percent of the salary cap, or $49.3 million this year. Washington will pay restricted free agent Nick Young, and their three rookies (Jan Vesely, Chris Singleton and Shelvin Mack). If Young gets a contract that starts around $7 million to $8 million, and the rookies make about $5 million combined, the Wizards will still have to figure out how to spend about $18 million to reach the salary floor.

The Sun faults the county for using debt service to help meet the maintenance of effort requirements, while acknowledging that the use of debt service was approved by the attorney general. On the substance of the issue, not the letter of the law, no one can deny that school construction and state-of-the-art, modern facilities are an integral part of a quality education that enhances student performance. It was, therefore, fitting and appropriate to use debt service to meet maintenance of effort requirements, even though that is no longer authorized and was not utilized in my fiscal 2013 budget.

Fashion's Night Out doesn't address a fundamental problem underlying the discounting—one that is visible on stores floors now. Like several fashion executives I spoke with, Saks Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Sadove says he would like clothes to arrive in his stores in season—say, wool sweaters showing up in October rather than in July—so that they wouldn't be stale and on sale by the time they are wearable.

What would "more" look like in an Obama second term? Again, Dick Morris thinks he sees the future: "TheG-20and the IMF will acquire sovereignty over our economy. I think that he will sign the International Criminal Treaty that would oblige the United States to get U.N. approval, which is to say, Russian and Chinese approval before going to war. I think he will sign the 'Rights of the Child' treaty, which would create a legal basis for suing to increase foreign aid to poor countries."
In concept, the weaving idea is perfectly inoffensive. In execution, it has grown into a sort of ornamental kudzu.

A: Rady Children's hospital was one of the first organizations we got involved with. They have always been close to our heart in regards to the amazing work they do for children that suffer serious injuries, diseases, cancers, all sorts of thing. I would say that the Friends of Scott was an organization that we identified six or seven years ago and what they do, just as far as providing support for families and patients dealing with cancer, is incredible. The Armed Services YMCA, certainly we know about the strong military presence here, and to help support an organization that supports so many military families has been truly an honor. And the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the work that they do in raising awareness and funding to find a cure for such a debilitating disease… I can truly say that these are four very respected and deserving organizations.

Teenage minds might actually be predisposed to risk-taking. In 2005 and 2006, researchers at Cornell and Stanford conducted risk-reward studies across a range of age groups. The study, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published in The Journal of Neuroscience, measured activity in two areas of the brain — one that triggers impulsive actions and another that reins them in with rationality and caution. Researchers found that when confronted with risky choices, teen brains exhibit twice as much activity in the impulse area as adult brains, while the area that expresses restraint lags behind. It takes until the early 20s for the two areas to reach parity, the study said.

Well, good and bad are relative in "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tomas Alfredson's film version of the John le Carré novel. A Soviet double agent has infiltrated the Circus -- the highest levels of MI6, British Secret Intelligence Service -- at the height of the Cold War. Strong plays Jim Prideaux, an agent who makes a memorable entrance in the film.

Jeff Schuster, director of forecasting at survey and research company J.D. Power & Associates, said he doesn't expect Toyota this year to recapture any of the market share it lost in 2010. At an analysts conference in Detroit last week, he said he expects Toyota to stabilize this year.
Accountants and lawyers who work in the new Ernst & Young tower will have views of a crushed-limestone operation, pleasure boaters on the lake and families wandering into the Greater Cleveland Aquarium on the west bank.
Charlotte Graham, the village clerk, said revenue from police citations, which include traffic tickets, was $209,669 in 2009, but it's difficult to say what percentage of the village's overall budget that number represents.
When it comes to Thanksgiving, gravy is the unifying force of the feast, bringing together bird and stuffing, imbuing all with the savory, herbaceous aromas we only need to sniff to think: Ah, Thanksgiving.
Greece also holds elections on May 6. Voters are expected to punish their established political parties heavily for the country's deepening economic depression, adding to the country's political instability.
The good news for me and, at a lesser level, for everyone in this class is that it's so smartly run and so enjoyable that you'd have to work hard to not learn something from it and to not have fun.

This week, state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, who has been closely involved in the negotiations, said that talks continue but that he isn't optimistic about its chances.
For the most of last season, Hassan Whiteside's position wasn't center on game nights. It was in a seat behind the bench in a sports coat.
Hollie Cavanagh got off to a shaky start Wednesday on "American Idol" with her rendition of Queen's "Save Me." The Texas teen may have saved herself by following that up with an inspiring version of Miley Cyrus' "The Climb." It brought the judges to their feet. "Perfect song for you," said Randy Jackson, who'd singled her out earlier as the finalist who needs to step it up most. "That was stepping it up," Jennifer Lopez raved.
Principals at affected schools have until Tuesday to decide which positions to scale back or eliminate, and layoff notices are expected to go out in August.
Benson, an economist at Florida State University, added: "If you get an officer who's a bully, the private firm won't get much business and will be liable in court. Just try to collect from a public police officer who accidentally shoots someone."

"Look, this is a wonderful place," he said. "(You'd still) get cheap golf at $20 round. We put $6.4 million into a new building and we need to put some back into the community."
The truth is, Americans are not a peace-loving people. We pretend otherwise because it seems wrong to admit that the United States is a nation that has mostly benefited from war. We were not like the contented Canadians, who patiently waited for the Mother Country to bestow self-government. We went to war and tossed the British out. Through one war with Mexico and relentless wars with Indian tribes, we became a country that spanned a continent. The Spanish-American War and the First World War marked our arrival on the world stage. And the Second World War left us as one of the two preeminent powers on the planet.
Next up: the Arizona Celebration of Freedom, which DMA, the city and various sponsors will host on the last weekend of June.

WASHINGTON — Vice President Joe Biden says the latest job numbers show an economy still struggling to recover, but not one where hiring suddenly has stalled, which he says just might if Mitt Romney is elected.
One key ingredient: fan access and participation. CD releases come complete with lottery tickets for a chance to attend a "handshake event" to meet members, or with ballots for popularity contests for members, with the top vote-getters performing on coming singles or appearing in music videos. Many of AKB48's hard-core otaku, or geek, fans buy dozens, or even hundreds of copies of the same CD to give their favorite girl a boost in rankings, or to win a chance to meet her in person.
Flaherty is fighting for the Orioles' open utility spot this spring with Matt Antonelli and Steve Tolleson, among others, so that flexibility is key. If he doesn't make the club, the Orioles will have to offer him back to the Cubs at half the original $50,000 purchasing fee.
Forecasts for 2012 call for construction spending to increase and accelerate further in 2013 and 2014, according to the report.

It's not that economics achieved nothing. The emergency measures thrown at the crisis in many countries -- exceptionally low interest rates, "stimulus" programs of extra spending and tax cuts -- probably averted another Depression. But it's also true that there's now no consensus among economists as to how to strengthen the recovery. Some, for example New York Times columnist Paul Krugman of Princeton, favor aggressive stimulus. Others, for instance Harvard's Martin Feldstein writing last week in The Wall Street Journal, want to reduce long-term budget deficits on the theory that doing so would improve confidence.

Bear in mind that EPA estimates are just that - estimates - and your driving routine may not match the EPA's results culled from controlled tests. Also be aware that smaller cars that perform well in crash tests may not fare as well in real-world driving, where they share the road with much larger vehicles such as SUVs and pickups. Larger vehicles tend to have lower death and injury rates because of their size and weight.
Mozeliak emerged from failed negotiations with Pujols to rousing applause at the team's Winter Warm-Up. A team that came within one loss in September to Atlanta of missing the postseason now receives benefit of the doubt following a remarkable postseason run made possible by last summer's trade activity.
Monroe's own film work was spotty. The camera absolutely adored her, of course, and although she reached for deeper roles in films such as "Bus Stop" and "The Misfits," she was much more successful in comedies. She was brilliant as Sugar Kane in Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot" opposite Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, and with Tom Ewell in Wilder's "The Seven Year Itch," which included her famous white-dress-billowing-up-over-a-subway-grate moment (the iconic pose within the icon). She also shined in Howard Hawks' fun musical "Gentleman Prefer Blondes" (imitated 30 years later by Madonna in her "Material Girl" video).
One of the most distinctive branches holds Stanford's Wallace Stegner fellows (including Harriet Doerr, Ron Hansen, Tobias Wolff, Vikram Seth, Alice Hoffman). It's a big branch, and sturdy. Tom McNeal is one of the finest examples to come along in a while. His first novel, "Goodnight, Nebraska," was awarded the James A. Michener Memorial Prize when it was published in 1999. "To Be Sung Underwater" is his second.
So freighted with meaning and mystery, that word, circus—from kirkos, the Greek for "circle." Let's associate for a moment.
The newspaper continues to have a daily online presence -- 7 days a week. Not all alumni or students are happy about the reduced days of printing. And Potter acknowledged that the newspaper lost a lot of advertising revenue because of it, but he said it's been worth it because of the savings in printing costs.
"I'm not going to lie, we're a little thin," Brewster said.
The skyrocketing production budgets come at a time when studios have clamped down hard on all costs, particularly actors' salaries. With few exceptions, including "Men in Black" headliner Will Smith, there are no stars left on Hollywood's A-list whose worldwide luster justifies more than $20 million per performance.

Michigan Republicans will get 42 delegates based on the results within the state's 14 congressional districts and another 14 at-large. Only 30 will be able to vote at the national convention because Michigan violated GOP rules by moving its primary to an earlier date. Because there is, in effect, an election within each congressional district, it's possible a candidate who doesn't win the state could end up with more delegates by winning a majority of congressional districts. The 14 at-large delegates will be apportioned proportionately based on the statewide vote.
It’s an effective, get-out-your-Kleenex model, and the number of books it has powered has been nearly matched by the movie adaptations — “Message in a Bottle,” “Nights in Rodanthe” and “The Notebook” among them — it has inspired.

Moyer isn't sure when or how the King James first edition came to the society, though the "He" Bible was mentioned in a 1931 article in the Baltimore Sun. Johnston believes the Bible was owned by someone in Hereford in the early 19th century. "We just don't know which Hereford," he said with a smile.

Jeff Husney’s handiwork can be seen around town.
That isn't particularly likely since Phillip Anschutz, head of AEG, always has wanted to own part of whatever football team moves there and would presumably want a large cut of the Angels. If anything, it might motivate the NFL to expand, so it can get to L.A. first, or encourage a team such as the Vikings to get off the dime.
Rinse the daikon well under running water, and then spread it out to dry in a clean dish towel, rolling it up gently so as to extract as much moisture as possible from the radish. Add the daikon to the brine along with the zest and coat well, letting it marinate for one hour. Eat immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 month.

Other players with numbers for Nerinx Hall were Maria Redel (two goals), Hayley Bokern (one goal, one assist) and Gabrielle Calandrini (one goal, one assist). Nerinx Hall goalie Lizzie Puzniak saved the only shot she faced to pick up the win.
In 2003, climber Aron Ralston hiked into a Utah canyon without telling anyone his plans. He became trapped by a boulder and was forced to cut off his own arm to free himself. Ralston went on to detail his struggles in a book. His story was later adapted into "127 Hours."
And "Somebody left the gate open"? I guess the gate was closed when a rock meant marriage, not hiking.

A new bar menu (available 4-10 p.m. daily, with happy hour pricing 4-7 p.m.) is another good reason to go: Enjoy a cheese and charcuterie plate, buffalo burger, crispy chicken livers or a basket of those signature sticky buns, among other selections. Cocktails here change with the seasons, so winter brings more robust flavors such as cranberry, huckleberry and spiced rum. The mood is usually mellow, unless things get particularly competitive on one of the two bocce courts, but the scene livens up when bands take the stage 6-10 p.m. Fridays.
Poor Bellatrix. She’s a bad one, through and through, yes. But she is mad, you know. And there’s the lingering feeling that if she weren’t quite such a sadistic monster, she might be a hell of a lot of fun at a Halloween party.
"We get paid for the service we provide," said airport facilities manager Chris Martin. "This isn't an anomaly  a custodian found $5,000 worth of cash two weeks ago and turned it in so we could return it to its rightful owner."
I try to follow the political discussion in the U.S. and am amazed how much effort it takes even to begin to be well-informed. If you are serious about being informed, you can't be the least bit lazy and depend on a couple of pundits to shape your world view. You have to get out there and study the people you disagree with — in their own words, not the pundits' words. Information comes at you like a fire hose and you better not be off to the side sipping out of a dripping garden hose.
About 26 cents of every dollar the lottery receives goes to education. Sixty-four cents goes back to players as prizes and 10 cents funds retailer fees and administrative costs, including ads. In other words, the advertising money does not come from state general revenue.

All carbohydrates (a category including sugars) convert to sugar in the blood, and the more refined the carbs are, the quicker the conversion goes. When you eat a glazed doughnut or a serving of mashed potatoes, it turns into blood sugar very quickly. To manage the blood sugar, the pancreas produces insulin, which moves sugar into cells, where it's stored as fuel in the form of glycogen.
