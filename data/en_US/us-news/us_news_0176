Several FIU players say they are considering transfers because of Thomas' firing. FIU hired former Louisville associate head coach Richard Pitino to replace Thomas last week, and when he was introduced to the campus community, Pitino acknowledged that staying at the school may not be "a good fit" for everyone on the roster he inherited.
Besides the minority controversy, many Illini fans and boosters are expressing outrage that Thomas couldn't come up with a more proven coach to succeed Bruce Weber. Many prominent Chicago-area basketball leaders who had never heard of Groce, let alone met him, also are voicing serious concerns.
A:The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits housing providers from discriminating against applicants or tenants because of their disability and requires that they make reasonable accommodations to afford such persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. This includes adjusting rules or policies, such as exemption from a weight restriction for pets, for a person that requires the assistance of an animal for a disability-related need. However, tenants are still responsible for the actions and behavior of their companion animals, regardless of their designation as such under the law.

Spectrum Brands filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and shed $840 million in debt through its reorganization. When it emerged from bankruptcy later that year, it had a stronger balance sheet with a greater ability to invest in new products, said Hamed Khorsand, an analyst with BWS Financial in Los Angeles. Spectrum Brands, he said, is poised to return to profitability in 2012 after two years without a profit: "They're putting money to work, making acquisitions that make sense, investing in research and development and investing in high margin products."

Though officially neutral, the U.S. steered the course of the war by selectively providing aid. The U.S. Navy escorted convoys of merchant ships across the Atlantic to keep England afloat. We shipped huge loads of lethal arms to the USSR to stall Hitler's Russian campaign, and we cut off fuel shipments to Japan to curtail its conquest of the Pacific Rim. Contrary to his neutrality speech, these actions showed FDR was itching for an opportunity to commit American forces to the war.

Oregon once led the world in mint oil production -- one of the many niche crops the state's farmers excel at. Farmers distilled oil, put it in 55-gallon barrels and sold it to wholesalers who in turn marketed it to gum, candy and toothpaste makers. Mint oil is powerful: a pint flavors 45,000 sticks of gum. Production dropped sharply as manufacturers switched to artificial flavors or blended oils. Seely found himself the last mint farmer in the lower Columbia River region.

Beyond 2012, Nike will quickly shift its focus to Brazil where the World Cup and Olympics will be held in 2014 and 2016."

A rogue wave came in and soaked him.
But my daughter has a good head on her shoulders, and she's taking things one step at a time. First, learn to swim. Second, practice the hula. I don't know why, but she seems to think that doing the hula is an integral part of being a mermaid. I'm hoping she doesn't feel too betrayed when she figures out that the fishtail thing doesn't just happen as a natural part of puberty.

Unfortunately, the way the MHSAA has dealt with this issue is reprehensible. The MHSAA constitution was not etched in stone and handed down from a mountaintop. If we can add amendments to the U.S. Constitution, surely the MHSAA can modify its rules to allow our schools' most special students an opportunity to be a part of the general student body through athletics.

10. THE CONFESSION: In January, before he made his first public appearance as the Cardinals' November-hired hitting coach, Mark McGwire admitted that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his career. Suspicions of steroid use dogged him since his appearance before Congress, so it was hard to call his confession a revelation. But it did defuse a storyline that threatened to usurp the Cardinals' season. Quite simply, the circus never came to town. The mob attention expected for McGwire never manifested. There was no Tent City in Jupiter, no pitchforks waiting for him in each town he visited. He was always available and always on point, and quickly the questions fizzled. A true measure of how the story burst and then faded came at the end of the season when the Cardinals considered McGwire's return as hitting coach it was an OBP and SLG decision. Not a PR one.

The other most common nailing defect that I find with asphalt shingles is improperly located nails; specifically, high nails. When shingles are located too low on a shingle, it's an obvious defect that anyone with a good eye can usually spot from the ground.

It's true. You can hardly walk down the street without bumping into the West Coast offices of a major car company. Volkswagen, GM, BMW, Renault-Nissan and most recently Ford.

It's not the only such house. Authorities say the Oct. 12 incident is an extreme example of a growing trend in Oregon, as medical marijuana growers move into neighborhoods and protect themselves against robberies and home invasions.

That was back when Clifford Ronnenberg's parents owned a dairy and roadside diner, which is now the site of the citified ParkAve restaurant.

Wednesday in federal court, a lawyer for the toll collectors said that after they spoke out against plans this summer to privatize their jobs, the authority on Feb. 25 vindictively removed a "right of first refusal" provision that would have given the toll takers first dibs on jobs with the new company handling toll collection.

To expand on Dubinsky's baseball metaphor, swinging for the fences on government consolidation carries with it a greater risk of striking out.

The line was a gift to Romney's critics on both the right and the left. For his primary season opponents, it underscored Romney's rap as a conviction-challenged pragmatist whose history of changing his mind on social policy issues portends an insufficiently conservative future in the Oval Office. For supporters of President Barack Obama, Fehrnstrom's ill-advised strategy dump paved the way for a Democratic National Committee ad that practically wrote itself. Using a red-rimmed Etch A Sketch drawing toy to frame grainy images from the Republican primary trail, the spot painted Romney as a candidate of shadowy positions that should spook voters.

And as to the baggage fee refund, you get it only when an airline actually "loses" your bag. If it's just delayed, DOT says you get bubkes.

The Yankees announced Pineda had an anterior labral tear and will have surgery Tuesday. Because his rotator cuff was intact — that was the good news — the Yankees think the surgery can be less invasive and the right-hander can return in 12 months.

When I started seeing commercials for the Farrelly brothers version, I was actually laughing.

Instead, we get Sean Hayes, Will Sasso, and a name I’ll probably even butcher in the written review – Chris Diamantopoulous.

In the first game of the series, the Blues' third and fourth lines weren't nearly effective enough. In Game 1, the Sharks' third line scored the tying goal, then San Jose won in overtime.

Coaches will tell you about the importance of players growing in the playoffs. And some folks will talk about the importance of sustaining a making-the-playoffs environment in Denver. But the argument Kiz made was, if there are enough good players in the lottery that Denver thinks it can hit in the lottery, then maybe it's not the worst thing. Moreover, the higher a draft pick the Nuggets have, the more value - and they could combine that with a player of two in a trade to move up.

I was so looking forward to seeing that great musical, "West Side Story." I was shocked to see, as your critic put it, that they "updated" it by adding obscene gestures, sexual innuendoes and enough crotch grabbing to wear out a pair of jeans. Did someone actually think that no one would come to see this play if they didn't add these kinds of things? What a world we live in.
John Adams' "Absolute Jest" is a work of terrific imagination and out-of-the-gate energy. It opens with a paraphrase from Beethoven -- the bounding rhythmic motif that starts the scherzo of Symphony No. 9 -- and then sets to creating a world. We hear gentle janglings of percussion and soft peek-a-boo gestures from the winds: Life is emerging inside a big teeming organism, represented by the orchestra, which Adams sets to shimmering and pulsing.

Growth can not be decreed: It is the result of unpredictable decisions and actions by countless individuals, all capable of effort and imagination. And growth can only come if these countless individuals' impulses are not paralyzed by regulations, taxes, or dependence on the state.

øLet's start with computer-generated measures. First stop: standard deviation, which isn't what it sounds like, and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking it. Standard deviation measures a fund's expected volatility vs. its average. For example, suppose a fund's average annual gain was 10% over three years. A fund with a standard deviation of 3 could be expected to fluctuate between 7% and 13% about two-thirds of the time.

But because the screenplay conceives courtship as essentially strategic rather than romantic, the film strikes the familiar beats of a sporting contest rather than the rarer chords of love.

One trader at a firm that owned a portfolio full of bank shares—which immediately began falling—printed out my photo and stuck it to her bulletin board with the word "WANTED" scribbled over it. I'd poked a stick into a hornets' nest.
This symphony, free of extra musical subtext, is nevertheless highly affecting. It is also accessible with unique orchestrations that make it seem fresh without being trite, overbearing or too cerebral.

The bill makes it easier for quality new teachers to gain tenure. If an educator receives "excellent" ratings their first three years in the classroom, they can earn tenure. Additionally, tenured teachers that change districts can earn tenure in their new setting if they have a track record of superior ratings, and receive "excellent" reviews for their first two years. With more weight put on evaluations, the bill also calls for a more streamlined process to remove ineffective teachers with poor performance reviews.

For investors who do buy into Carlyle, however, there is the promise of a special "true-up" dividend at the end of each year based on higher distributable earnings during good years. While the company has set a quarterly dividend of 16 cents that would result in an annual dividend yield of between 2.6% and 2.8%, a "true-up" dividend for 2011 would have resulted in a total annual dividend yield to shareholders between 7.6% and 9.3%, based on the IPO price range.

The lack of a primary challenge to Mr. Obama may also be because many loyal Democrats have an appreciation not seen elsewhere of the difficult hand dealt to him by unforeseen circumstances and the dedicated obstructionism of the other party.

When Sanu was first unveiled to the Scarlet Knight faithful in the 2009 Spring Game after just one week of playing receiver, it was clear to all who were present that he was the most talented player on the field despite his inexperience. Miles Shuler has some of that talent. He is built differently than Sanu, at 5-10 and 170 pounds, but the former Army All-American found himself on the field more and more as his true freshman campaign went on. Rutgers never was able to find him the ball in the air, but he did carry 6 times for 42 yards on reverses and gave glimpses of the speed and talent he possesses. Next year, you can be sure he will be utilized more as a traditional receiver after a full offseason. Think Tim Brown in 2007 and his sophomore season. Brown, like Shuler will be used as a deep threat before he learns the position and becomes an all-around receiver in his final two seasons. For reference Brown had 24 catches for 355 yards and two touchdowns in 2007. I’ll sign up for that for Shuler in 2012.

Lynn said they decided to drive instead of fly to Florida because his wife, Lauren, was more comfortable, their two dogs could snooze in the backseat and it would give them plenty of time to get here and get ready for spring and their first baby. The original due date was Sunday - the same day as the Cardinals' and daddy's first official workout of spring. He's thankful she arrived early, too.

My daughter runs on a 9-year-old's adrenaline. I need caffeine. There's an espresso machine seemingly every 10 feet in Seattle, where you can visit the original Starbucks (First Street and Pike Street) near Pike Place Market. It's kept much of its brown-and-white 1971 interior intact unlike the green cloned Starbucks all over town (and the rest of the planet) . My coffee pit-stop of choice is Espresso Vivace (227 Yale Ave.), a Northern Italian style shop just across the street from the REI super store (the one with all the mountain bike trails and climbing rocks). The espresso rocks my sleepy synapses and the cream-drawn leafs in the cappuccinos are a work of art. In a city of tens of millions of coffee cups, this is the pinnacle.

Some of those concerns are evergreens, like my correspondents' calls on stories they think have been under- or overplayed in the pages of The Kansas City Star. One good recent example: Readers have told me they appreciated the Aug. 7 story on the front of the Local section about claims by the computer hacker group Anonymous that they had stolen confidential information from some 70 law enforcement agencies' websites, including those of sheriffs offices in Kansas and Missouri. However, more than one told me they thought the subject merited more than the one story in print and a few more that have run on KansasCity.com. You would think this was a minor event judging from the coverage so far, wrote one emailer, suggesting the breach had far wider public safety implications.

Authorities have never revealed if the young violinist left a suicide note.

Congress has had months to discuss the issue, yet we are now on the brink of defaulting on our nation's debt obligations. If that happens, everything from Social Security payments to war funding to food inspections would be at risk, and the fragile U.S. economy would be sent into a tailspin. A default would send shock waves across global markets, and the ensuing panic would result in major sell-offs on all major stock exchanges. The resulting crisis would force a panicked Congress to raise the debt ceiling within days of default — but the damage would already be done. Interest rates would spike as the dollar collapsed, and we would lose our nation's AAA credit rating, making it far more expensive to manage our national debt.
“A miscarriage of justice would have been averted had the government complied with the law,” said Brendan Sullivan, the lead attorney for Stevens, reacting to the Schuelke report. “There would have been no illegal verdict.

The lack of Republican enthusiasm was especially noticeable during what you and I agreed on Monday, Bruce, was the most critical week of the campaign, when official Washington hurried to respond to the early fall meltdown on Wall Street. McCain's decision to suspend his campaign to join the negotiations was a huge gamble, one that in retrospect did not pay off. But while Democrats uniformly denounced McCain's decision as a stunt and a gimmick, the only people who spoke out in favor of the gambit were McCain and his campaign aides. Congressional Republicans were noticeably silent as to the merits of their nominee's participation for several days. By the time House GOP leader John Boehner stated that McCain's presence had been helpful, conventional wisdom had long since hardened into concrete.
