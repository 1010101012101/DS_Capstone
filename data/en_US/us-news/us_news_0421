A majority of panelists ultimately backed the drug due to its impressive weight loss results, with most patients losing nearly 10 percent of their overall weight after a year on the drug.

Studies of Qnexa show it raises heart rate and causes heart palpitations, a longtime concern with diet pills over the years. The group of experts said it is still unclear if those side effects lead to heart attack and more serious cardiovascular problems.

Last week's decision triggered predictions that corporate dollars will flood into politics. Perhaps. But common sense suggests that most businesses -- even those that can justify new expenditures in this economy -- will be wary of making enemies by engaging in overt partisanship.

The Man from I has turned the best moment of his presidency into a political prop and a grating reminder of his insufferable egoism. If you just landed from Mars, you’d think he flew the copters into Pakistan, slid down the rope, stormed the fiend’s house and fired the kill shot — all by himself.

Look, as spectacular as LeBron was Monday, you also have to weigh that against him entering the playoffs dragging. To be honest, I'd sit him Wednesday

"You wish just one of those shots could've dropped because I thought our guys worked really, really hard," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said.

Said Cashman, "Coach Coughlin made some adjustments the year before he won the Super Bowl. He removed some of the rules. He backed off on a few things."

When the 90-day legislative session ended at midnight April 9, the General Assembly had failed to pass key revenue measures needed to balance the proposed budget to which leaders had agreed.

I watched the first two episodes, and have a few thoughts: the incessant repetition of the fact that the winning designs will be instantly available at the stores is so annoying it makes "Fashion Star" feel like an infomercial. Act now! Or almost now! To buy! Buy! Buy! Why you'd think the stores had paid NBC for...oh. Right. That said, the buyers from the stores are actually interesting to listen to. It's mildly fascinating to notice which buyers bids for which garment. And Willard is a TV natural. And how could this be a fashion competition show without some wildly overdramatic would-be winners? All in all, it's loud and pushy, but pretty entertaining. (9:30 p.m., NBC/8)
This guide to selecting non-invasive plants is more a booklet than book, yet packs quite a bit of info on the baddies that strangle our trees (English and Irish ivy), displace native plants (various brooms from across the Atlantic Ocean) or are prickly (albeit delicious) and ubiquitous (Himalayan and Armenian blackberry). Besides that, it provides alternatives to the plants your conscience won't allow you to have.

Taking his cue from the band's name, McAnuff hit on a way to tell the story: Organize the show in four parts and let each member of the band tell his version of events.

"It says so much about young people and their voice and what we can do when something's wrong and we're not quiet. People are such sheep. We always have been. We find some leader and if enough people believe them the rest will follow. Think about school and bullies and somebody hurting -- can you not feel that when you see somebody's picking on another kid and people are laughing? It's very rare that an entire group of people can stand up and say, 'That's wrong,' and start fighting back. That's what this is about.

4. Echo Lakes, Tahoe National Forest: From U.S. 50 near Echo Summit, turn on Johnson Road and head toward Echo Lakes and you'll find the road blocked by snow, with parking adjacent to a Sno-Park area. From here, trek 2 miles down to snow-covered Echo Lake Road to the foot of Lower Echo Lake. Bear to the right to skirt the lake. It's 4 more miles to the head of Upper Echo Lake. When the lake is rock solid, some people will cross-country ski on the lake, and you might see youngsters try to run on the ice and take flying slides to see where they end up. Crazy, easy and fun.

The fabricated degree periodically appeared in various summaries about Thompson before Yahoo lured him away from his previous job running eBay Inc.'s online payment service, PayPal.

After this idea evaporated, I explored possibilities on the website of The Freelancers Union, a professional association that offers its own health insurance in New York. Five plan choices popped up. Great, I thought. Then I clicked further to read about the plans' residency requirements and up came a map. The right side of the state -- covering 34 counties that share borders with New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and Canada -- was colored in blue. These counties are the lucky ones. Those on the left -- 28 counties that border more of Pennsylvania and Canada, extending all the way to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario -- were white, meaning no Freelancers Union health insurance. That's where Tompkins County is.

In politics, dozens of Republicans cried that the newly drawn 6th Congressional District was patently unfair, then proceeded to knock each other senseless trying to be the first one to file as a candidate for the office. As drawn, the new district includes parts of Montgomery County, that bastion of godless, tree-hugging, foreigner-tolerating, Prius-driving, tax-and-spend, uber-liberal pinkos. Montgomery County, in turn, expresses surprise that Washington County isn't actually part of West Virginia.

There were many times when the concert caught fire: McConnell’s lengthy ride on "Maze," for instance, or Fishman’s supple attack on "Divided Sky." The "Character Zero" jam, which closed the first of two sets, was capped by a dazzling circular run of notes by Anastasio. "Moma Dance," sung in part by Fishman, built to a nostril-clearing climax; when the song segued into a cover of the Velvet Underground’s "Rock and Roll," it was as if a thunderhead of sound had opened above the crowd. (Phish also covered J.J. Cale’s "After Midnight," which felt rushed, and Jimi Hendrix’s "Fire," which became a showcase for Gordon’s melodic bass playing.)

The fact is that single-gender schools -- public as well as faith-based and independent -- have a long history and will continue to be an educational option for many children; these schools provide us with opportunities unaddressed by the authors of "Pseudoscience." They fairly criticize those who recommend sweeping educational reforms in response to modest or unsubstantiated evidence; indeed, they provide a useful public service by highlighting the dangers of shaping a single-sex classroom in response to small or debatable differences between the genders. However, there are many real and substantial differences between girls and boys that can shape their education in a meaningful way. Here is what we know: Girls lead boys in a variety of language skills, and boys outperform girls in spatial skills, mechanical reasoning, and engagement in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) careers.

Someone, who I later found out was Subtext's co-founder Andrew Goldman, answered about an hour later, saying Ms. Fey has two daughters—a 6-year-old and a 6-month-old.

But that's how I, an adult, see "Teen Mom." I wonder, though, do teens watching this show get that reality? Or, when a pregnant teen mom on the show is the guest of honor at a baby shower, do they think, "Oh, I'd be the center of attention"?

Perhaps the better gauge then is park factor, which helps illustrate how much harder/easier it is to produce hits, runs and power in individual parks. The Rangers' ballpark, where Pujols cranked three homers in a record-setting World Series game, is the best place to hit in the majors. By some measure, Busch Stadium was the hardest.

Pujols is going from one pitcher-friendly park to another, and while he didn't seem to have a problem hitting at Busch it does mean that as his career decline begins the ballpark isn't going to be forgiving.

Across America, churches have been turned into nightclubs, factories into loft apartments. And with the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, what used to be called insane asylums have found new life as well.

The negotiations are expected to take weeks as Congress faces an Aug. 2 deadline to avoid a first-ever, market-rattling default on U.S. obligations. It's a politically perilous vote made more difficult by the influx of tea party-backed Republicans who propelled the GOP into control of the House.

Still, a favorite argument of drug-legalization supporters is that because "we all know" alcohol prohibition failed, drug prohibition is destined to fail too.

The other incentive for getting best record is money. The NBA's playoff pool has has $346,105 set aside for the team with the league's best record, the San Antonio Express-News' Tim Griffin reports.

Mystery. * * R. Edgar Allen Poe, one of America's greatest literary geniuses, comes to life as a dashing, conflicted writer caught in a series of maddening events shortly before his mysterious death. John Cusack's accessible, Hollywood-friendly Poe is a charming, penniless rogue and boozer, and Cusack brings an inherent likability to the role. But a lurching plot and director James McTeigue's ("V for Vendetta") indecisive tone prevent Cusack from ever rising above a slight portrayal. Think Guy Ritchie's recent "Sherlock Holmes" movies but less fun, and with a few "Saw"-grade torture-porn scenes. (John Wenzel, The Denver Post) 111 minutes
The Sydney Harbour Bridge was built in 1932 and is the world's largest, but not the longest, steel-arch bridge, with the top of the bridge standing almost 440 feet above the harbor. Fondly known by the locals as the "Coat Hanger," the Sydney Harbour Bridge just celebrated its 75th birthday. When the bridge opened, it cost a horse and rider three pence and a car six pence to cross. Now, horses are not allowed to cross, but you can bicycle or walk across the bridge for free. Cars pay about $3.30 for a southbound trip, while it is free to go northbound. In 1932, the average annual daily traffic was around 11,000; now it's 160,000 vehicles per day.
Mary Bonauto, a lawyer for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders in Boston, argued that states have always set the laws on marriage and family.

Sweeteners do more than impart a sweet taste. Sugar inhibits the growth of microbes (bad bugs) in jams and jellies. It can balance the acid taste of dressings and sauces. It adds volume, texture, flavor and color to various food creations. Chewing gum that contains xylitol - a sugar alcohol - has been found to prevent dental caries.
A: We did it in 17 days. I would never do that again; it was very difficult. There's nothing in there that we kept. Some light fixtures and an oven, but other than that, we replaced everything.

Another well-publicized sting operation this year targeted Planned Parenthood, whose workers were recorded giving advice on medical care and abortions to actors pretending to be sex traffickers with prostitutes as young as 14. In late 2009, the community action group ACORN was the target, when O'Keefe and a woman, pretending to be a pimp and a prostitute, sought -- and got -- advice on how to hide their business from the IRS. That surreptitious recording led to the withdrawal of federal funding from the organization.

Ozone is a very reactive gas. It's invisible, so you can't see it, but it's very powerful and potent and it's a respiratory irritant. In the short term, ozone causes chest irritation and a sort of burning-in-the-chest sensation when taking a breath. Ozone is also associated with respiratory illnesses, so we can actually see this in absences from school, for example. In the long term, ozone is associated with a whole range of outcomes including mortality, but also hospital admissions and a number of cardio-respiratory (heart and lung) effects.

In October, the superintendent and all seven board members attended the Missouri School Boards' Association conference at the Lake of the Ozarks, at a cost of about $10,270, according to district records. More recently, Les Lentz and Doris Ann Graham - both of whom were ousted in the election April 5 - attended a Federal Relations Network conference in February sponsored by the National School Boards Association in Washington. That rang up a bill of at least $4,647, with each of the incumbents staying at a Hilton hotel. The total cost of that trip, however, could not be tallied because the district did not provide details on airfare to the Post-Dispatch.

OK, so this tradition has no doubt come to pass because Beaujolais Nouveau is released within two weeks of Thanksgiving - and because if all the wine writers say it's so for years on end, eventually it will be so. (Our creed includes a promise of a November Beaujolais column.) But here's the deal: For the same reason Pinot Noir works so well, so do wines made from Gamay Noir. They're fruity, earthy, relatively high in acid and relatively low in tannin - all things that match with a blasé bird like turkey (and also more interesting fowl). Also, Beaujolais is relatively cheap and available in quantity, which is crucial.

As a voice of conscience from the countryside, Chen is unusual in China. The 40-year-old has suffered greatly for standing up to corrupt provincial officials, exposing land grabs and forced sterilizations and abortions.

During the Oct. 7 presidential debate, John McCain proposed to spend $300 billion of other people's money to buy "bad" mortgages. This is a very misguided proposal.

For now though, Lewis said teachers are "fed up." At schools that took the mock votes, teachers voted 95 percent or unanimously for the strike, union officials said. Although she described negotiations as "cordial," Lewis said in her 25 years as a teacher, new district policies like a longer school day, rescinding of a 4 percent raise last year and a new evaluation system weighed increasingly on student performance have led many educators to feel under attack by CPS.
