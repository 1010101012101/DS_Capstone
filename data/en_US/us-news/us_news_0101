The risks inherent in this shortsighted strategy are self-evident. Each time either candidate rails against organized labor, denigrates the auto bailout, or tries to outflank the other on hot-button social issues such as contraception and same-sex marriage, hes generating a video record that may come to haunt him when a larger, more moderate electorate starts focusing on the general election.

&bull Offering for voter approval a constitutional amendment forcing the state to fully fund its pension obligations in each year’s budget. While the requirement would not yet be in effect, a full payment for the upcoming budget would be about $2 billion out of a budget in the $28 billion range. Payments have dwindled to cope with budget woes, including Corzine eliminating this fiscal year’s contribution entirely. Corzine also allowed local governments last year to postpone part of their pension payments, arguing that covering the full cost would drive up property taxes in a recession.

Hagedorn is one of four psychiatric hospitals in the state system and the only one to specialize in geriatric psychiatric care. After Christie became governor, a transition team recommended last year that the 288-bed facility be shuttered to save about $7.6 million and funding for the hospital was initially stripped from this year’s budget. A last-minute deal between Christie and the Legislature in June reinstated the funds in exchange a review of the system.

Terence Davies adapted and directed the film, based on the play by Terence Rattigan, with a complete immersion in the viewpoint of his lead character. This is a small story, set in 1950, but the emotions are epic, and Davies expresses those emotions with an epic treatment - with a loud string section on the soundtrack, dreamy takes and scenes that crystallize in just a single line of dialogue, suggesting the power of memory to compress events into moments.
Four minutes later, Montero once again gave the traveling supporters reason to cheer. The 24-year-old struck a shot from well out which took a slight deflection off DeMerit, then dipped just over ‘keeper Joe Cannon and into the goal to put the Sounders into a 3-1 lead.
“It was to the point when I really could feel the baseball in my hand,” Martin said. “I tried to throw to second base and didn't have any feeling. The ball took off on me. They took me out of the game. We're going to see probably how it feels tomorrow, just come in and get some treatment on it, and you know, go from there. It's just a bruised thumb.”

As Bissell writes after playing the zombie-centric Left 4 Dead: "All the emotions I felt during those few moments — fear, doubt, resolve, and finally courage — were as intensely vivid as any I have felt while reading a novel or watching a film or listening to a piece of music. For what more can one ask? What more could one want?" But soon after, he considers the nature of fellow video game fans whom he meets in a gaming store. "I then realized I was contrasting my aesthetic sensitivity to that of some teenagers about a game that concerns itself with shooting as many zombies as possible. It is moments like this that can make it so dispiritingly difficult to care about video games." Like a chat with a smart friend who may have fallen for a ditz, "Extra Lives" provides a lesson in articulate ambivalence.

The growth of health costs slowed in the 1990s as health maintenance organizations became more popular. That played a role in both gains in household income -- less money on employer-provided health benefits means more money for raises -- and in budget surpluses, economists argue.

Marcial Herrera, 44, has had his bank account frozen repeatedly since 2009, blocking his access to $800 a month in government benefits. Unable to work because of a severe back injury he suffered in 2000, Herrera fell behind on child support. He owes more than $7,000 -- not to his 22-year-old son, but to the state of New York, because his son received welfare years earlier.

“Our power play was great at times and really out of sync at times. We can get a little better there,” he said. “We talked a little about understanding that late in the game with a one-goal lead we turned the puck over a few times at the blue line trying to make some riskier plays. I think if we can cut that part of the game out it will be a lot better for us.”
Tepco will be primarily responsible for compensation to some affected by the food contamination, because it is the result of problems with the nuclear reactor, Mr. Edano said. He added that the government also will step in if the company's compensation isn't sufficient.

* It's Charlotte, who lives in a Wesen, or creature, rest home. She's an old lady, but her real age is 26. A Spinnetod herself, she explains that they're spider women who suffer from rapid aging. The only way to stop it -- suck the life out of young victims. The prescription: three at a time, once every 5 years. Charlotte has sworn off killing and that's why she looks so much older than she is. But it is a struggle, as she gives a lascivious look at Monroe and Nick: "You two young men look more tantalizing by the minute."

However, he added, he has not been pressured to try to make the Olympic team and realistically is looking at his best shot in another four years.
But Jung's attraction to Spielrein is more than theoretical; they begin an affair, some aspects of which allow the repressed Jung to act out more freely, you might say. Jung has a wealthy wife (Sarah Gadon) who knows about the affair, as well as several children. When Jung breaks off the relationship, Spielrein dashes off letters to Freud, describing the ethical breach. Freud and Jung are already beginning to disagree about Jung's interest in mysticism and other supernatural elements he is pursuing -- for Freud, everything about psychoanalysis must be based purely on science and reason if it is to gain wide acceptance -- so this gives Freud something of a moral high ground that he eagerly seizes.

In rebuilding the temple, designers didn't just replicate the original, but instead looked to the intent of the shogun. The original temple had a roof of gold. Its replacement is sheathed entirely in gold leaf. Even on a cloudy day it shimmers, the water of the small lake that surrounds it sparkling over the orange and white spotted koi fish. Above the temple are areas where visitors can have their fortune told.

I sponsored the Assembly bill that would allow all wineries to sell their wine at physical outlets such as tasting rooms, restaurants and shops in New Jersey. I believe my legislation balances the needs of New Jersey’s wineries by allowing them to continue to grow and flourish, and also protects the interests of our state and its residents. My approach is the proper one that balances the economic advantages with public safety and addresses U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Hayden’s concerns.
"Our willingness to run the bases as hard as we did tonight was a huge thing," Esmay said. "Things we've been trying to harp on we did well, trying to speed up the game in that other dugout."

They didn't in Game 1. Bynum tied an NBA playoff record with 10 blocks. The Nuggets shot only 35.6% from the field. And they allowed six Lakers to crack double figures. Still, it was fair to wonder what officials told Karl about the apparent non-calls since he seemed so upset.

Long ago, Aunt Margie said, the newlywed Patsy answered the phone one day and found herself talking to a woman who said she was Larry's first wife, Esther. She pleaded for money to get the two children from her marriage out of a baby home. If not, Larry and Patsy needed to claim the children. A stunned Patsy delivered the message to Larry.

The moment Superior Court Judge Patrick Arre said "15 years," Latoya Campbell, 20, became hysterical, as did her family members sitting in the courtroom.
What his listeners heard was music that my father would begin calling "rock and roll." "Race" music was considered unacceptable to the wider, white public. Dad took the phrase from the records he was playing, with lyrics such as "Rock me baby, roll me baby, all night long." "Rock and roll" was a known euphemism for sex; records like "60 Minute Man" were considered risqu . But to the general public, "rock and roll" became the name for a mysterious new genre of music. Its full impact was still years away, but, night after night, my father, Alan Freed, was already rocking and rolling.
"MFA is just a magical place," Konkel said. "The teachers there put all their time and effort into being positive influences in these children's lives and try to guide them to the right path in life."
The opposite is also true. If you choose an active lifestyle that includes regular strengthening, stretching and endurance exercise, you can maintain high levels of physical and mental strength well into your 80s and beyond.

Artists who dabble in Shrinky Dinks include James Jaxxa of New York City, who created "Hopeful Tree" for a Shrinky Dinks show in 2007 at Seattle's Zeitgeist Coffee. He likes the slightly unpredictable quality of the material: "With Shrinky Dinks, you're really out of control," says Jaxxa. "You can put it in the oven . and it might twist in some way that you didn't know would happen. The material itself almost forces another level of creativity that other materials don't."
Notes: Did anybody notice Galen Rupp's time in the 800 at last weekend's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Indoor Championships? The Oregon senior, a 2008 Olympian in the 10,000, finished the 800 in 1:49.87, which is quick for a distance guy. Salazar, Rupp's private coach, said the time would have been faster had Rupp been more tactically experienced at that distance. ... Rupp, who carries a 3.91 grade-point average in business administration, was chosen male cross country scholar-athlete of the year by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. Other local athletes honored by making the USTFCCCA all-academic team include former Centennial runner Ryan Vail, who now competes for Oklahoma State; Tommy Betterbed and David Kinsella of the University of Portland, and Nicole Blood and Alex Kosinski of Oregon. ...

Strong sales by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. squeezed the results of other smartphone manufacturers during the year-end holiday shopping period.
Sugarland performs "Find the Beat Again." I saw Sugarland just before their debut broke big, back when Kristen Hall was still part of the group, in a club with no more than 200 people in the audience. They sounded almost completely different than they do now. The dancers are doing a lot of hairography and there's a tumbling pass from male dancer Sasha. Tom interviews Jennifer Nettles about her ABC Family show coming up this summer called "Duets." I like the lineup of the judges/mentors; will have to make a note to check that out.
Ryan lives his own life in similarly unfettered fashion. His job takes him on the road - in the air - nearly 11 months of the year. He gives motivational speeches about being able to put your entire life into a single backpack. He has all the perks of the ultra-frequent flier. He's more comfortable sitting in first class than in his nearly unfurnished apartment in Omaha, Neb.

There wasn't any blood to speak of, but the muscle was cut, and he carries a lump and a scar to this day.

Furthermore, we need to start telling the full story about illegal immigration. Global trade policies, such as NAFTA, have been disastrous for workers and peasant farmers all over the world. As long as these economic insecurities exist, workers will migrate in search of income. Parents will do whatever it takes to make life livable for their families.

We allow major corporations to move capital freely across borders. Why don't the workers have the same right?

Thumbs up. I don't like the white uniforms as much as the black and gold versions, but overall the uniforms are very sharp and well done. Without a doubt the new uniforms will help convince some recruiting targets to pick the Tigers.

Dear Margo: I am dating a 57-year-old man who is quite wonderful in some ways, but he sometimes says disturbing things. Today, he reported that he walked down to the beach and studied "40 or 50 teenagers" to see what they were wearing. He wanted to tell me all about the current state of teen fashion at the beach. I told him I did not want to hear it. Conversation over dinner was awkward because I could not get this strange conversational overture out of my head, and he seemed not to be able to think of anything else to talk about. He has not shown any particular interest in fashion until now. I know that many older men check out teenage girls, but isn't it kind of a creepy activity, and one you wouldn't tell your girlfriend about? I'm wondering whether he has inappropriate proclivities. He also asked me once if it was odd for him to check out his daughter's boyfriend's female friends on Facebook. I said yes. He responded by defending his decision to do so ... and then did so. He also told me his wife (now deceased) slept with their daughter until she was 10. About a year after the daughter got her own bedroom, she stopped speaking to him for seven years. He has no explanation for any of this. — Greatly Confused

But as one teacher, Rebecca Sayler of Atlanta, wrote to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, "If you get rid of all of the bad teachers (which I hope you do, but doubt you will able to do if you only use test scores as indicators of effectiveness), we will still have students who are reading below grade level and unable to demonstrate even basic skills in other areas.

The center originally was a program of the city's parks department. The city still owns the building, but the center itself became an independent non-profit organization in 1988.

Earlier this year, Mayor Tom Potter proposed a eliminating $80,000 in support for IFCC, nearly a quarter of its total budget. But a public outcry helped get the money restored.

And Haywire, the globe-hopping spy vehicle Steven Soderbergh has built around his charismatic new leading lady, is, from start to finish, serious fun. Disarmingly laid back for this kind of fare, with a jazzy musical score (courtesy of David Holmes) and a sleek, straight-ahead style, Haywire may not make much sense plotwise, but it's a rollicking 90 minutes of double-crosses and triple-crosses, assignations and assassinations, close-quarters combat and cool espionage-speak.

I'm not ignoring the loss to Hammond, but you have to consider that the Hawks turned the ball over six times in that game and lost by three points. Akili Moore's 100-yard interception return was impressive, but River Hill probably won't turn the ball over six times again this season, or ever. Since that loss they've outscored three opponents 139-13, and have the third best offense and second best defense in the league.

Not everyone lives on a trust fund or works for, or is retired from, the government, which, these days, can be more lucrative than having such a fund. A recent San Francisco Chronicle column explained, "When it comes to city worker payouts, forget the old $100,000 club or even the $250,000 club – the new elite among San Francisco's civic workforce are those who got more than $500,000 in pay last year." Apparently, it's impossible to exaggerate how wasteful California governments have become.

Hey, Tony: Why isn't Josh Cribbs our third-down back? He can pick up blitzes, catch passes out of the backfield where he would be covered by a linebacker, or create mismatches elsewhere if he is covered by a safety.

Opponents of the casino haven't given up, but it looks as if there will be a $433 million, 254-acre development just outside Rohnert Park's city limits run by Graton Rancheria. Construction could begin this summer on the project, which would be one of the largest casinos in the state.

After Brandt Evans polished his skills at Kosta's in Tremont, bringing international flair to American fare, he launched Blue Canyon in Twinsburg, a massive, lodgelike space lined in polished blond wood and perched over a hill.

You became a starter the last three games. How did that unfold?
He's not lying about that. For now, I'll take him at his word - on April 28, the day the draft ends.
We look at Texas and other states like it that pride themselves on the number of people they kill in the name of justice, and we decry their cold-hearted obsession with the death penalty. But, in Michigan, more than in 48 other states, we condemn young boys to the company of adult lifers without so much as an afterthought.
Hey, Scott: Pontbriand has had one bad snap in eight seasons. I can't comment on my shirts because of my self-imposed moratorium on uniform questions.
"I don't know what year my grandparents married," Nancy Hensel said, guessing sometime in the late 1800s.
It is not clear how, or when, bomb investigators put Ohlsen on their radar. But he clearly did not like Eisen, who had represented Ohlsen's wife, Michelle, in their acrimonious divorce. Eisen also represented Joel Hollenbeck, the ex-husband of a former Ohlsen girlfriend, in a restraining order to keep Ohlsen away from Hollenbeck's daughter.

Collaborating with music director Greg Phillinganes, who worked with Jackson for more than 25 years, Antune says there were opportunities to take something not quite as well-known from then-master tracks and make them special, he says, such as the little know Spanish tracks Jackson performed for "I Just Can''t Stop Loving You."

The coach has been criticized in the past for job hopping—first from Louisville to the Falcons, then for the in-season jump to Arkansas. He infamously met with Auburn officials in 2003 to talk about taking the Tigers’ head coaching job while Tommy Tuberville still had it.
Under the new system, recycled items no longer have to be separated. Allied Waste Account Manager Susan Piazza said the firm contracts with Resource Management in Earth City, Mo., for a 'single stream" automated system that separates the materials using conveyor belts with huge "teeth-like" equipment.
The Orlando Sentinel reported this year that auditors had been unable to find warranties for more than 170 of 182 jobs that Hodges had performed and that Hodges had been paid for several jobs without district officials verifying that the work was even done.
For most of an hour Gore, the novelist, screenwriter, wit, social critic, television personality, movie actor and, though few knew him as such, politician held forth. We talked about the senatorial primary weeks hence; Brown, the eventual nominee and ultimate loser that November to Republican Pete Wilson, was leading. Polls, however, showed Gore running a noble second, gaining traction by questioning what, or indeed if, Brown was thinking in this, his seventh major campaign in a dozen years. Gore never did expand on his cryptic remark, "I read your story . . . ." I decided, however, that it must be writerly shorthand for approval, because he made what to him was probably a pleasantry but to me was a grand offer. "Oh," he said with the polite diffidence once characteristic of the American ruling class, "if you happen to be in Italy this summer, why not come visit us in Ravello?" La Rondinaia, Gore's exquisite 1920s aerie on the Amalfi Coast near the ancient city of Paestum, was a prized gathering spot for American literati. I decided I certainly would "happen" to be in Italy.
Injury-wise, running back Paul James and linebacker Kevin Snyder had short days because of ankle issues.
So much to do and not enough time: That is the common complaint among visitors to Paris. Author Andy Herbach has come up with a solution, of sorts. In this breezy guide he features one-day, weekend, one-week and two-week itineraries, providing what he calls the best suggestions for everything (that would include museums, art, architecture, accommodations, restaurants, shops and parks). He briefly discusses all of the major sites. He also includes do-it-yourself walking tours, including a culinary walk.

Melissa Gavin reread the court decision into the night, weaving facts that were new to her with the ones she had.
State senators approved the bill for the second consecutive year, but it's now in the hands of the same House committee that rejected it last year. Those testifying will have to persuade at least one Republican lawmaker to vote yes — something made more complicated in an election year where both parties are fighting for control of the Legislature.
"I don't get caught up too much in rankings, but he is one of the best out there," said Miami's Chris Bosh, another top power forward. "He's really started to turn the corner as a player."

Set in ancient Sparta, this work by the author of “’Tis Pity She’s a Whore” — coming soon to BAM, part of a virtual Ford festival — depicts the fateful chain of events that follow after the overprotective general Ithocles prevents his sister, Penthea, from marrying her true love, Orgilus, thinking he’s not in their station. Instead, he forces her to marry a much older nobleman, Bassanes, who has severe jealousy issues.

In other words, the monster of the week this time wasn't likely to arouse feelings of ambivalence in the viewer, unlike, say the pathetic mouse guy murderer of a few weeks ago. But while a similarly just-plain-evil villain made "Game Ogre" relatively monotonous, "Organ Grinder" was a solid episode.
So I asked what were the top confiscated foods at the U.S. port of entry.
“Dakota was all over the place for us,” Kays said. “I moved him from middie to attack today, and he did a real nice job. He works hard and takes some hits for a little guy, but he’s tough. I also thought that (McNutt) played well on offense as well for us, and on defense, I thought our goalie Ryan O’Leary came up with some real big saves in some big spots for us today.”
One GOP-sponsored bill actually targeted the volunteer watchdogs even further, trying to make it harder for them to visit facilities. That one didn't pass.

In the main event, Cena competed against David Otunga, who scored an almost unbelievable amount of offense in the match’s early stages. Cena made the comeback and put Otunga away clean, sending a message to Laurinaitis in the process. Cena’s taunts of the general manager were a highlight of the match. Afterward, Lesnar emerged and low-blowed Cena before delivering the F5.

If the venture's leasing strategy is successful, the property could sell for a big profit in a few years. For example, consider what would happen if the venture is able to increase the property's net income to $10 million a year. Even if values stay the same, and buyers continue to expect an initial 8.4% yield, the property could sell for about $119 million.
The Army also concluded that no one in Campbell's chain of command was informed by counselors that he had talked of shooting himself.

Price, a former Portland State football player, casts a big figure on campus. He works as a campus monitor. Between classes you can hear him bellowing down the long halls, "GOOOO TO CLAAASSS!!" And the teenagers hustle past him, fist bumping and high-fiving, and carrying textbooks.
3. The Jets were fortunate to even be in this game at all. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and predict they don't make the playoffs this year, especially if they don't get back to running the ball.
"Phenomenal kid," Steelers receiver Hines Ward said. "He's still learning the game, but he's a great student of the game. He's going to continue to grow as a quarterback, and what better way than to be behind Ben."
Ohio State has already imposed a five-game suspension and $250,000 fine on Tressel after self-reporting in March his violations for not revealing to his bosses or the OSU compliance department information he received in April of 2010 that two of his players, Terrelle Pryor and DeVier Posey, were potentially involved in selling memorabilia in violation of NCAA rules. Pryor, Posey and three other players were later suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season.
The medical mart complex -- built by the county and its partner, Chicago-based MMPI -- includes a four-story showplace for medical technology at the northeast corner of St. Clair Avenue and Ontario Street and a connected, L-shaped convention center beneath Malls B and C to replace the outdated city-owned convention center.

It could block a suit against this key part of the healthcare law if it imposes a tax. The law seems to say that no one can sue over a tax provision until he or she has paid the tax.
ø•Network. The phone is capable of tapping into T-Mobile's fastest so-called HSPA+ 42 network, which the carrier says reaches 184 million people in 181 markets. T-Mobile's 4G isn't as fast as the 4G LTE networks rolled out by Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Still, my speed test results, while wildly inconsistent, were generally pretty fast.
3. Pursue Flynn, Kolb: Green Bay backup quarterback Matt Flynn is set enter free agency Tuesday, but Heckert has twice said he doubts the Browns will find their starter in free agency. If that's true, they'll pass on a player who's started two NFL games and could command a $40 million to $50 million salary.

7. Always use room-temperature milk and butter to prevent the potatoes from cooling prematurely. Mix in milk and butter and stir until ingredients are well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. Or, make up to 2 hours in advance and allow them to stand uncovered at room temperature. Reheat over medium-low heat, stirring and thinning with a little more milk, if needed.
"Dance Off" is patterned after other dancing games, such as "Dance Central." But the dancing takes place in famous "Star Wars" locales, such as Jabba the Hut's palace, and the computerized dancers include Lando Calrissian, Han Solo and Princess Leia. Watching them get down is a hoot.
Sheppard, 25, gave little reaction, cracking only the slightest smile before sheriff’s officers led him back to the Essex County Jail.

Q: I understand that you won't put anything on your menu that your family would not eat. True?
Q: Can I hook up my iPhone to my iMac and dictate into a word processor? Or should I just dictate into the Notes app on the iPhone and send that by email? I am executor of my mom's estate and she left a lot of written memories that I want to compile into a book for family members. It would be a lot easier to dictate than to type them all.
"Let's be honest, at some point in time not just Morley (Safer), not just Ed (Bradley), many people in this room were not speaking to my father," Chris Wallace said.
Yet with this venture through "really important" poetry, they weren't going for straight stupid so much as utterances that sound funny.
First and most obvious is the possibility that our personal data will fall into the wrong hands. Powerful data-mining tools are available not only to legitimate corporations and researchers, but also to crooks, con men and creeps. As more data about us is collected and shared online, the threats from unsanctioned interceptions of the data grow. Criminal syndicates can use purloined information about our identities to commit financial fraud, and stalkers can use locational data to track our whereabouts.
HONG KONG—Two companies aim to raise a total of up to $5 billion through initial public offerings in the fourth quarter, as the city's market for new listings shows more signs of revival despite steep stock-market losses.
Small investors' best bet at gaining a piece of these companies — without huge risk — will be through mutual funds. Funds own shares in dozens or hundreds of companies, so if one fails, the damage to the investor is less severe.
Having declared the album dead, Mr. Cuban wonders why artists don't serialize the release of songs, creating a "season" for fans in which new music would appear every couple of weeks. (I immediately thought of They Might Be Giants' old Dial-A-Song service, and then of artists who've turned to more-frequent EP releases, such as Ryan Adams and Ben Folds.) It's easier, Mr. Cuban argues, to ask music fans for 99 cents each week than it is to ask them to pay $9.99 once for 10 songs.
TRENTON — Lawmakers, lobbyists and businesspeople this morning will continue the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce’s 75-year strong tradition: a four-hour chartered train trek to Washington, D.C. for networking and a speech from the governor.
Funds from operations -- a key industry performance measure -- rose to 23 cents per share, a 28 percent increase from a year before. The company's first-quarter revenues reached $43.4 million, up 32 percent from $33 million a year before.
We hope your wife is following a vegetarian or Mediterranean diet, as there is scientific support that both lower inflammation in the body. If her doc pooh-poohs that, he's probably not going to prescribe antibiotics. A holistic rheumatologist may be more willing to give it a try.

Rituals help us mark the sacred nature of time by highlighting the presence of God in that moment. Like Jacob, we awake to see a new reality around us, testifying that "Surely the Lord was in this place and I did not know it." As each of our kids has stepped across the threshold from childhood into adolescence, we've tried to incorporate some sort of ritual as a marker. It can be as simple as a family ice cream outing, dinner at a favorite restaurant, or as poignant as confirmation and commissioning to specific acts of discipleship in church.

Now, there are still thousands of miles of roads, railways, and runways left to repair and improve. And engineers, economists, governors and mayors of every political stripe believe that if we want to compete, we need to rebuild this vital infrastructure. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the most modern airports – we want to put people to work building them right here in America. So this week, I've proposed a six year infrastructure plan that would start putting Americans to work right away. But despite the fact that this has traditionally been an issue with bipartisan support, Mr. Boehner has so far said no to infrastructure. That's bad for America – and that too is what this election is about.
Separately, a bill that some MARTA advocates this year hoped would lift restrictions on how much of its sales tax revenue the agency could spend on operations, House Bill 1052, failed in a close vote at the very last minute of the session. Fulton County Democrats would not accept a compromise that suspended the restrictions only for three more years, and shifted control of MARTA board appointments.
But, you know, that is exactly what has happened in the past. The problem, recently, is that many have no interest in the developing a budget to fit the state's income. To their mind, income is the most flexible part of the budget. There is no limit to the amount that the state can take in given the ability to generate income from its citizens.
"It's big," said Miller, who finished with 15 points, seven rebounds and seven assists against Phoenix. "I don't know if the young guys know about positioning in the playoffs. But you want to position yourself to get a decent matchup in the first round."

St. Louis aldermen and state officials likely will weigh these issues in the coming months as they mull approval of tax-financed incentives key to the long-stalled project next to Busch Stadium. When nearly one in every four square feet of downtown office space sits empty, and the vacant storefronts rival full ones, does it make sense to use public money to help a team build more?
This guy played pretty well, but I'd only keep him if he took a minimum contract. We need the salary space for (hopefully) better free agent talent.
The participants were randomly assigned to two programs: Kundalini yoga Kirtan Kriya meditation or passive relaxation with instrumental music. The yoga meditation program included breathing, chanting and repetitive finger movements, call mudras. Both were done for 12 minutes a day for eight weeks.

“Yes, still working on it, still having conversations and still doing certain things to help beautify this city,” O’Neal said. “When the time is right, we’ll have a party.

There is still time to reverse the backwards planning process. A successful plan for transportation must precede the South Hillsboro development.

On the other hand, I had a client in Canada who proudly talked about having doughnut shops seemingly on every corner there. Based on my experiences in his country, that wasn't far from the truth. The Tim Horton's chain of Canadian doughnut emporiums has over 3,000 locations of its own. And they're quite yummy, eh? So in my mind, Heaven looks more like Toronto than Paris.

Those who condone this activity unfortunately do not understand that it is diametrically opposed to what our recent mission in Afghanistan is all about. In fact, this type of incident causes our troops to be placed in an even tougher position as they try to achieve success in Afghanistan.
And all he keeps telling his players is the same thing that Jimmy Valvano told his North Carolina State players 29 years ago before they faced the University of Houston:

Johnson nearly broke his slump in the Orioles' three-run sixth when he hit a sinking liner to left that Eduardo Nunez rushed toward, then misplayed. Nunez was charged with an error -- and Johnson a hitless at-bat -- but two runs did score on the play to give the club more breathing room.

Tumbling from Oregon's high desert to coastal redwoods, the Klamath is the third most important salmon river south of Canada, after the Columbia and Sacramento. But hydroelectric dams cut salmon off from vital habitat around Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon, and water behind the dams turned uncomfortably warm for fish.
Bon Jovi ran into a few opening day problems. A planned military fly over never happened. The stadium’s sound system also cut out for nearly a minute during "Runaway."

Though Glenn is NASA's go-to place for space communications expertise, SCaN pushed the center's capabilities to the limit. Twice, NASA nearly pulled the plug on the project. The difficulty of conceiving its futuristic radios, then building them to withstand the brutal conditions of space, took so long that SCaN missed its ride on the space shuttle fleet, which NASA retired in 2011. It almost lost its backup seat on the Japanese space agency's rocket, too, until last year's tsunami delayed the launch schedule.

It appears that Mandel would support keeping student loan rates low if there is another way to pay. A number of Republicans originally objected to continuing the interest-rate cut, calling it an election-year stunt, but Mitt Romney, the assumed GOP presidential nominee, this week suggested that he, too, does not wish to see student loan rates rise. Republicans propose paying for the low interest rate by taking money the government planned to use for a portion of health care reform.

TIP 8: Buy a kid's meal … for your kid, and for yourself if you're cheap. This is America, so your top priority should be “buy the kid a hot dog.” The Rally Monkey Kid's Meal checks that box off at a reasonable price by ballpark standards. For $5 you get a small Kid's Dog, a Kid's Soda and a bag of pretzels. The dog is small. It's a bit rubbery. But we're cool with that. It's well suited for a small child, or for a larger child who wants to save room for ice cream. (I recommend the sundae in a miniature plastic Angels batting helmet. It's $6.50, but for a little kid the helmet can double as a souvenir.) You'll find the kid's meal at grandstand concession stands throughout the stadium.

Sun and wind will never become a significant portion of our energy mix. High-priced oil since the 1970s has created 40 years of extensive conservation; there is little more to be gained.
