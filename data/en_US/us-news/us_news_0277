There are three main areas to consider when evaluating a wine: look (color, legs), aroma (smell) and taste (mouth-feel and palate). Each step tells a story about the wine and is a fun part of a tasting party. There are reasons for each step, and this week I'll explain the "what's and why's" of look.

Up a few steps in 98-year-old Slottsbiografen, tucked away just off the lobby, is a tiny room with an antique movie projector. This plain room has a resplendent pedigree: It was here circa 1930 that an adolescent Ingmar Bergman, visiting the theater with his grandmother, sat with the projectionist and developed his love of movies.
One thing about booking airline tickets, securing a hotel room and reserving a rental car: You get a torrent of confirmation emails, which often are then copied into a online calendar or to-do list.

He lived what he believed and his attitude toward life showed itself in ways big and small. He was bold in standing up against school segregation in the late 1940s in Orange County and against internment of Japanese Americans during WWII in California, and humble in choosing a name for his company – Freedom – as opposed to naming it after himself.
Under Ohio law, consumer fireworks can be sold, but they must be taken out of the state within 48 hours to discharge. Sparklers, trick noisemakers and novelties are exempt from the law. Those who wish to hold fireworks displays must apply for a permit from the municipality in which they wish to blow off the fireworks, must carry a minimum $1 million in insurance and must be officially licensed for such displays. In other words, that backyard display you want to put on for your neighbors is illegal, not to mention very dangerous.
The attack started around 6 a.m. in eastern Kabul with a series of explosions and gunfire ringing out from the privately guarded compound known as Green Village that houses hundreds of international contractors. Shooting and blasts continued for hours later as militants who had stormed into the compound held out against security forces, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.

Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Cello Concerto also grew out of a film score -- "Deception" (1946). Aller, pregnant with son Fred, played on the soundtrack. It's a dark and dramatic piece, 13 minutes long, compact in form, surprisingly dissonant in spots but also filled with feverish lyricism. Zlotkin, who played his mom's cello Thursday, caressed the yearning melodies passionately, although the athletic passages didn't project. The familial vibe of it all left a special feeling in the hall.

"We obviously have a lot of leadership, both on and off the field," McIntyre said. "Some of those seniors are role players and we'd be at a loss without them. Conversely, our man up team, which is our special offense and our best six players, will only lose three to graduation. Of our starting six midfielders, we only lose two to graduation. We have a tremendous sophomore class, so the future looks pretty good as well."
The larger telescope was bequeathed by the estate of George Mahlburg, the founder of the association’s monthly speaker program. He was well known as a radio host specializing in outer space topics.

Former UFC light-heavyweight champion Rashad Evans caught up to discuss his upcoming bout at UFC 145 against champion Jon Jones, his former teammate.
The 53-minute film deals briefly with Owens' time in Cleveland, and mentions neither East Tech nor Dillard. It attempts to shed fresh light on lesser known aspects of Owens' career and life. He was not in favor of the U.S. participating in Germany because of its mistreatment of minorities and Jews, and the American team's participation remains controversial to this day. The film states an oft-repeated story that Owens resisted being a late addition to the 4x100 relay, because he did not want to take the spot of a Jewish teammate. However, the Owens biography "Triumph" by Jeremy Schaap counters that legend, saying Owens instead campaigned to be on the relay in which he won his fourth gold.

To predict reactions of a broader public, 31 subjects interested in quitting smoking were recruited for a focus group to evaluate samples from three antismoking ad campaigns: A (a humorous effort that empathized about the difficulty of the task), B (more serious but also empathetic), and C (lighthearted). Ads in each campaign ended by posting a hotline number for help quitting smoking. Researchers measured the viewers' neural activity as they watched.

Most racing teams, whether they compete in NASCAR, IndyCar or Formula One, are constantly looking for ways to raise money through sponsorships. Patrick's marketability has certainly helped her career in this regard (you'll probably never see IndyCar stars Dario Franchitti or Will Power on a Super Bowl commercial), but she is approaching the point of her career when on-track results will need to weigh more than her marketing appeal.
"The fact that the divorce rate isn't higher for remarriages shows that a lot of people are trying very hard and with great success to make their second marriages work," says Andrew Cherlin, professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University. "We used to think that second marriages were much more fragile."

Henninger: Well, I think that the Obama White House and the Democrats have reached the point where it doesn't matter to them all that much whether the Supreme Court rules against them 8-0 on this. They still take away the issue of Republicans and Mitt Romney being anti-Hispanic. I don't think the voting bloc is going to be paying really close attention to the federalism issues at the center of this case. They're still going to be able to run against the Republicans and Arizona--the right will at least get the law--as being anti-Hispanic. And it's purely a political play.

More importantly, job growth slowed sharply in March and April to an average 135,000 a month, barely enough to keep up with a growing population. From December through February, employers had created an average 252,000 jobs a month. That was the best three months of job growth since the recession ended in June 2009, not counting months thrown off by the hiring of temporary census workers in 2010.
Secondly, regarding pensions and long-term health insurance, Mr. Foxworth bemoans that "players who retire from the NFL leave with, at most, five years of health insurance." How many of us in the "real world" as opposed to the "fantasy world" of sports, leave our jobs and have our health insurance paid for us for another five years? Is our COBRA coverage paid for us? Or our individual health policies after retirement? I think not. Why should the NFL players have theirs paid for by their employer at their retirement? They earn millions in salaries — let them pay for their own health coverage. And yes, they may be exposed to some more severe health issues after their careers, but they chose to enter that career — it's called risk and reward. Are their jobs any more dangerous than coal mining, steel working, or a career in the military? I think not.

Hey, Franklin: Seeing as Congressional is the second-longest U.S. Open course in history at 7,574 yards, logic says you should like the guys who can get it out there ...

And, it always helps to be able to putt it like Donald, Cabrera or Steve Stricker. That being said, put me down for Phil Mickelson.
That was my reaction when I heard recently that the movie "Dirty Dancing" is going to be back in circulation again. Jeez, can this film and its incarnations just be put on a shelf and forgotten? Apparently not. Bollywood made a version called "Holiday." Then there was the big stage adaptation. At the 20th anniversary it was re-released to much fanfare. A limited keepsake DVD edition came out in 2010. Oh wait, I almost forgot that late-'90s TV show based on the film.

The state of the spirit, it is believed, reveals itself in small tasks, rituals — all the things that war interrupts."

Davies is a theoretical physicist who has taken up astrobiology (which I wish were still called "exobiology," since life is unlikely to exist on stars), but he's not much of an arm-waver: "We still don't know whether the origin of life on Earth was a freak event and whether the evolution of human intelligence was a statistical fluke....

To address these issues, it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. On September 11, 2001, nineteen men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives of innocent men, women, and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington, and killed many more.

As far as I'm aware, there is no epidemic of riflemen twirling their Winchesters in California's public squares. And the idea that they ever would is pretty silly. Open-carry advocates seem to genuinely believe that they're safer if they're allowed to mosey from saloon to supermarket while sporting shooting irons Gary Cooper-style, but even the most strident gun nut would have a tough time slinging his .30-.30 through Ralphs -- or using it to defend himself if his fantasy scenario ever came true and he was actually attacked by a mugger.

øSOULFUL WORKOUT: Rock's hardest working guitarist, Warren Haynes, who has his own band and plays for several others, didn't coast for a moment during his Blues Tent show to close out Saturday. His current Warren Haynes Band, which includes a horn section and feisty backup singers, is more soul/jazz-oriented than blues-jam inclined, but they blended all of those elements during the powerful set. Original songs River's Gonna Rise and Sick of My Shadow and the cover of Steely Dan's Pretzel Logic (all from the new Live at Moody Theater album) featured lengthy duels between Hayne's stinging guitar and Ron Holloway's squalling tenor sax. After acknowledging the passing of friend Levon Helm (Haynes' band subbed for Helm), he brought out Dr. John and members of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band for the Dr.'s classics Walk on Gilded Splinters and Such a Night, then referenced Helm with the Band classics The Weight and It Makes No Difference.

But the continued emergence of wide receivers like Wes Welker, Jordy Nelson and, even in some ways, Victor Cruz, has shown that assimilation into certain systems, the understanding of leverage and the ability to think with your quarterback are just as valuable. Look for more late-rounders to shoot off the board that aren’t exactly household names but ones that can fill a specific role right away and contribute on special teams. Because the NFL keeps tipping toward a pass-happy league, expect a lot of them to go.

Elway also can offer Manning a road map on how to maintain his sanity in a geographically isolated, Broncos-crazy town that lives and dies with its football team.

Mr. O'Sullivan was working in sales at Google (he was employee No. 210) when he bought the property for $4.9 million in 2004. Originally he planned a makeover of the existing 1950s house. But as he immersed himself in the project, taking five years off in part to oversee the design and the construction, its scope grew and he ended up taking the house down to its studs. The renovation was completed in 2008 for an estimated $4.5 million. A 2,200-square-foot, three-bedroom remodeled 19th-century house down the street is currently for sale for $2.8 million.
A: This is by far the most performances I've ever done of a full musical. I'm already at 120 on this tour. As an actor, you have to constantly challenge yourself to stay in it. You always find new beats, new moments, new ways to experiment with how you do things. You're living in that person's skin for so long. In one way your body starts to feel really comfortable with it, but you can't get too comfortable.

-- In 2005, Mattaliano formed the Portland Opera Studio Artists program to train the next generation of young singers, some fresh out of graduate school. Each year, he gives them a production in the Newmark Theatre -- a work far from the mainstream, by, for example, Claudio Monteverdi, Britten, Leonard Bernstein or, this year, Maurice Ravel. The quality of singing, sets, costumes and staging is usually high, and audiences see an opera they might not otherwise enjoy.

The FDA already requires labels to identify food that is made from concentrate or irradiated. At least 50 countries in Europe and elsewhere require disclosure of GM ingredients.

Richardson is the second member of the class of 2012 for CMU, along with Cadillac (Mich.) forward John Simons.

As Frohnmayer points out, the debate now is different; it's not entirely about funding, but also about giving the three major universities more flexibility to operate successfully outside the state's regulations.

DWP Commissioners Lee Kanon Alpert, Forescee Hogan-Rowles, and Jonathan Parfrey support Measure B because they know how important it is to establish a real solar energy program by passing this ballot measure.

The 2010 review is notable for its comprehensiveness. It captures the magnitude of the challenges that the U.S. military must plan and prepare for today, from fighting a counterinsurgency in Afghanistan to earthquake aid efforts in Haiti, all while keeping an eye on rising powers of uncertain intent. The document also does a good job of highlighting areas that typically get short shrift in defense policy discussions. It notes, for example, the need to better support service members and their families, with a special focus on wounded warriors -- fulfilling commitments that the commander in chief made when running for office.

I do feel a little churlish, mentioning in the same breath, that not only was the Peanut-and Wasabi-Crusted Halibut ($27) not very good, but the portion was quite small for the money. After all, the price seems excessive for a piece of halibut barely larger (albeit considerably thicker) than our overcharged credit card, even with the crust and a coconut sweet-chili sauce. Less of the additional flavors and a little more of the fresh, sweet taste of the halibut itself would have greatly benefited the dish.

Although consumers tend to focus on monthly service fees, the changes at TD Bank highlight the numerous ancillary charges customers can incur with checking accounts. A study by The Pew Charitable Trusts this year found that checking accounts can come with dozens of different fees, many of which can be difficult for consumers to find on bank websites.
