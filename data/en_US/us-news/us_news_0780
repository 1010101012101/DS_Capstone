It starts with director John Madden, who is always adept at spinning a yarn; here, he has completely embraced the whimsy of screenwriter Ol Parker's adaptation of Deborah Moggach's novel "These Foolish Things," about "outsourcing" one's retirement to India. That country's Rajasthan region, where the film is set, lends its exotic temples, emerging industry and teeming humanity to provide a vibrant backdrop, and it's beautifully shot by cinematographer Ben Davis, who last worked with the director on"The Debt," which was released in the U.S. last year.

Another option is to use one of the new systemic insecticides found at local garden centers. Many can be applied to the soil where they are taken up by the roots and moved up the stems into the foliage. Even after the leaves or soils around the plants have been treated, wax-like scale debris often lingers behind until the leaves eventually drop. The treatments should keep the scale from spreading to the new leaves.

For those who follow the Revised Common Lectionary, the message of God starting over has been at the heart of the Lenten scriptures. Within the covenant of God's grace, we listen as God expresses an intent to erase human sin. God speaks to Noah, offering the sign of the rainbow as a promise that all things are new.

This time God declares a strong revision of the covenant, promising to write the law deep within the hearts of God's people, saying "I will forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more."

Mariners 5, Tigers 4: Chone Figgins hit a tie-breaking double with two outs in the seventh inning, and Seattle completed a three-game sweep at Detroit.

Michigan State at Duke, Dec. 1
"Those are some big dudes who muscle their way around," Bayne says. "I'm terrible at basketball, which is probably why I respect those NBA players and what they do. They're just such incredible athletes."

But Slade remains in control, both staging vampire attacks with the fast ferocity he brought to “30 Days” and, wisely, slowing things down for a sexy camping trip. He brings new blood to the vampire saga — and although “Eclipse” isn’t a great film on its own, it’s pretty much the “Twilight” movie fans have been waiting for.
The Obama campaign and Democratic National Committee have been targeting Romney since last summer. They are armed with hundreds of millions of dollars and hours of entertaining video from 13 Republican debates.
Just as her story begins to take the shape of other expat narratives, it starts to unwind. The short chapters fall out of chronological order. Each of them has sickness and drastic fevers. They get unengaged but stay together; their connection frays. They are broke, they are hungry, she is assaulted, he is robbed. It is a shifting story of unbecoming, of unmaking, of things that can't sustain the hope vested in them.
"So we have a lot to do. We have an obligation to the people to turn the page and go on," he said.
When it comes to underage drinking, beer distributors are understandably vocal. Besides the health and safety issues that arise with illegal consumption, underage drinking invites bad publicity for the beer industry's middlemen and raises the prospects of tougher regulations. Many distributors try to provide educational materials to discourage underage drinking, such as graphic photos of car accidents aimed at high school students.

Martin Van Buren 15, Far Rockaway 2: Edgar LeBron homered, scored twice and drove in five runs, Frank Diaz scored three runs and drove in three as well and Sean Naidu had two hits and four RBIs for Van Buren (5-1) in Queens B South. Far Rockaway is still winless at 0-6.
"To me, those are the great teams. Not necessarily record-wise, but those are the great teams. That's what chemistry is all about. I thought we had it that year, and I certainly see it in the Bulls and that's why they have been able to overcome all those injuries."
In case you were wondering what happens next, Marty's staff contacted the guest who had occupied the room during the disappearance and asked about the whereabouts of the hotel's TV. They were polite. They were persistent. "But you can only push so far," he says. In the end, the hotel took the loss.
But Walton said he was not overly worried about adjusting.
"The LED market virtually exploded the last five years," Sestak said. "The whole industry readjusted in such a short time. But that also meant that designers had to adjust. There's so much to learn  what's a driver? What's a chip? But it just gives us so many more options to pull from our toolbox."
“I have such great respect for Kurt because of how he earned everything he got and because of the professionalism he showed as we transitioned to Eli,” Coughlin said. “I welcomed any thoughts he had on how we might improve.”

The fact is, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department can't afford to put a cop on every block. Or every two blocks. It wasn't able to do that when times were good, and it certainly won't be able to now that times are bad.
taking the number six spot is whitewater rafting, preceded by mountain biking at number five and snorkeling at number four. Of course, you can do these almost anywhere else, but not many can say they've done it in Thailand.

As the new chief executive officer, Earley took charge of a company reeling from the fatal 2010 explosion of a natural gas pipeline owned by its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Nor were PG&E's problems confined to the San Bruno explosion. A failed California ballot measure and stubborn resistance to the company's new, wireless SmartMeters had strained relationships with customers, regulators and politicians.
New York magazine dressed up Lindsay Lohan as Monroe last year for a cover spread. Angelina Jolie tried on a Marilyn-like platinum wig for a photo shoot. Nicole Kidman tried Marilynizing herself for the magazines. So did Jessica Simpson, Anna Nicole Smith and Scarlett Johansson.
Not a single lawmaker has agreed to participate. Talk the talk, sure. Walk the walk, no thanks.
Urlashov's victory was overseen by several hundred election observers from Moscow, representing independent agencies and opposition parties.
The lawsuit was filed Monday against Attorney General Eric Holder; Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano; U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Alejandro Mayorkas; Robert M.

Then came Uribe, a quiet one for seven in the NLCS before this one. On a 1-1 pitch, he claimed he got hit in the hand by Oswalt's fastball, but plate umpire Wally Bell said it was a foul.
So, why should anyone think that anything has changed?

Not just memory
Tim Allen narrates, and he's a good choice. It's just a shame that he had to read such a dopey Disneyfied script.
Sandusky held summer football camps — both at Penn State satellite campuses and at other Pennsylvania schools — for years after he was banned from taking youths onto the main campus by the school's athletics director and senior vice president. Both officials have now been charged with failing to tell police about a 2002 allegation that Sandusky had sexually assaulted a boy in the showers of the football building.

Then big-city kid Ren McCormack (Wormald) shows up in town to live with his aunt and uncle (Kim Dickens and the always-enjoyable, often-underused Ray McKinnon). He struggles to fit in generally; specifically, when he learns of the ban on dancing, it's too much.
øI was getting my morning coffee, chatting with a couple of my neighbors about some misdeed that was being perpetrated in the neighborhood. I can't even remember what it was, but it was serious enough to get us all riled up early in the day.

Kyle Murphy, an offensive lineman from San Clemente, Calif., selected Stanford over USC, giving Stanford a loaded offensive line class.
The soups of the day were pasta fagioli and charcoal-grilled chicken lentil, $2.75 when served a la carte, and both were nicely executed. The lentil was dark, smoky and thick with beans and pieces of grilled chicken. The pasta fagioli had a rich, tomato-based broth with tiny circles of tubettini pasta, beans and chunks of vegetables. Both had a mild, peppery finish.
There were upwards of 15 players who sat out Thursday's scrimmage at Reser Stadium.

On the upside, the sea is normally placid here, making the Kahala a good spot for children. The hotel has anchored a swimming play area just off the beach.
"Being faced with fiscal constraints is nothing new to people who have worked in cities like Flint or like Youngstown," Williams said. "Coordinating the resources that do exist, cutting through the red tape, is something we've had to do to stay alive."
The danger of investing in gold is that the metal has no intrinsic value. It doesn't pay interest like a bond, or represent a share of a company like a stock. It is only worth what people believe it's worth, and that means that prices can rise and fall based on emotion.
P&G has said its research shows there is strong interest among consumers in things with both environmental and economic benefits. Its own bottom line also benefits from reducing energy and other costs.
2010 Buena Vista Sonoma County Zinfandel ($13, 13.5%): Now owned by the Boisset empire, this historic Sonoma property has turned back to the past with a label that looks like a stock certificate that Agoston Harazsthy might have held. Their basic bottle makes the best of a straightforward approach, tangy, fresh and showing solid Zin berry fruit.
Indeed, Beiser's formative years in Israel were spent solidly with the standard classical repertoire.
“I don’t think you ever catch a good team like that at the right time,” he said in a conference call Monday of the four coaches participating in the conference tournament. “No matter what the result was of their game against Hopkins or our game against Duke, I don’t think that comes into play with this one. I think it’s just a matter of these two teams showing up. We know each other very well. It’s not like you’re going to start all over with your scouting report. When they come out on Wednesday afternoon and play us here, neither the Greyhounds nor the Pioneers are going to be thinking about what happened last week.”

My interest in religion now is directly related to raising my children and indirectly related to the fact that I feel more compelled to preserve Jewish traditions since moving to St. Louis seven years ago. (I grew up in a very Jewish community in Chicago; I definitely feel like a minority here).
There are no restrictions on Roy's playing time, and he remains a focal point of the team's three-man bench as it heads into the playoffs. McMillan said Roy will continue to be the team's backup point guard as it heads into the postseason. How long Roy stays on the court is still up in the air.

Birza isn't forgetting his family. "The main reason I wanted to do 'Survivor' was to say thank you to my parents, who have given me everything necessary to succeed in whatever I want to do," he said.
Hudson downplayed his reaction.

“We feel we’ve been playing playoff hockey through the season,” Callahan said. “That’s the way we play anyway.”
DeForest Buckner, 6-foot-7, 235-pound DL, Honolulu (Punahou). Buckner will make his announcement at the bowl choosing between Oregon, Notre Dame, Cal and UCLA.
Red Blue T, a Republican consulting firm, and ArmourMedia, a Democratic one, say they have come up with a way around the timing problem. Under their proposal, the groups would use a third-party firm called m-Qube, an "aggregator" that works with cellphone companies to arrange transactions for businesses and charities.
A sturdy picnic table in the backyard is the perfect location for your crab feast. To protect the table from mallets and picks, cover it with several layers of newspaper or butcher paper. This also simplifies clean up at the end of the party. Simply roll up crab shells in the paper – being careful to first remove any flatware and crab crackers – and discard the entire roll. For a splash of color, layer a runner like our Found Seed Sack Runner on top of the paper.
This year is no different, even if the celebrity quotient seems a bit down from the first years of the Obama term. Major news organizations have still managed to fill their tables with a mix of the major inside-the-Beltway power players and boldfaced celebrity names.
"There is a lot of research that was done before drug companies were involved, and it's rare to have a universal, positive effect (as has happened with ADHD)," he noted. "Medication often seals the diagnosis."
Long is tied for sixth in the NFL with 13 sacks.
Jimmy Dimora is no Anthony Sowell. But the lame-duck Cuyahoga County commissioner looking down the barrel of 26 corruption charges and the alleged serial killer do have one thing in common: They both want taxpayers to pick up the tab for their defense.
The Big Sort: Mitt Romney and Rick Perry won't be there, but the big show in politics today is still the Ames Straw Poll. The pressure's highest on those now very unfriendly rivals from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann and Tim Pawlenty. Bachmann needs a win (or a very close second) to solidify her top-tier status just as Perry prepares to challenge for her Tea Party and religious conservative base. T-Paw has bet the farm on next year's Iowa caucuses, and a mediocre showing would hurt a lot. If he seemed edgy -- at last -- in Thursday's GOP debate, that's why. Pawlenty's ace in the hole: He's reportedly got a very good ground game. So did Mike Huckabee, the break-out star at Ames four years ago.

Such persistent claims of blamelessness lead his former students to believe that Merzbacher would not have accepted a plea deal if it had been offered years ago, so it shouldn't be offered today.

"The made in America brand is in great demand and highly valued all around the world," Locke said during a panel session with Northeast Ohio business executives that followed President Barack Obama's speech at Cleveland State University. He added that only 1 percent of U.S. businesses export. Of those, the majority export only to Canada or Mexico.
"With sand and pea gravel, it's a mess issue. Sand moves around the yard quite a bit and can even get tracked into the house on kids' shoes," said the Ace Home Expert. "Rubber mulch has gotten quite popular over the last 10 years. It tends to look good longer."
Under the agreement, the result of four days of negotiations last week, Gibson and Grigorieva will have 50/50 custody of Lucia, now nearly 2, and he will also let her continue to live in a house he owns in Los Angeles. When Lucia turns 18, he will sell the house and put the proceeds into a trust for her.
Nobody, Dildine emphasized, expects these productions to be polished. At Commerce, for example, there were no rehearsals at all. Costumes are simple, at best; props and sets range from the minimal to the nonexistent.
"I have younger clients that do really well but didn't have anything saved, and now they have a really great nest egg," she says. "If you have a baby, you have no idea what it will cost to send that child to college unless you meet with someone like me. Some people want to retire when they are 60 and have no idea how much to save."
Surviving are her husband of 65 years, Willard E. Stone; brothers Warren Dotterer and Raymond Allen; children Gregory M. Stone of Frenchtown, Darren L. Stone of Mount Laurel and Kevin W. Stone of Elm Grove, Wis.; grandchildren Jonathan, Justin, Daryl, Darra, Frank, Rachel and Alex; and five great-grandchildren.
Those would be encouraging words, except that doing "what we have to do" in the parlance of the tax-and-spend crowd almost never means reducing spending but, instead, concocting new ways to extract more money from taxpayers.
Residents and city officials have expressed strong opposition to various parts of the project.
Yahoo could have ended this proxy fight by simply putting Loeb on its board.
Christopher C. Keresztes, 20, faces aggravated assault charges after allegedly striking a 25-year-old West Windsor man several times in the head with the bat, leaving two small cuts over the man’s left eye.
"It's right there on the wall," said Thuney, who watched Woods shoot a 62 to shatter the course record by four strokes and break the tournament record by two.
Still, the five-time NBA champion added: "There's nothing like a game."
Sadly, society has found it difficult to conduct a meaningful dialogue about the potential dangers. Seniors' knee-jerk reaction is to dwell on how much better they drive than teenagers. Thoughtful seniors will concede that there is a certain unfairness to challenging someone to a urination contest when you haven't quite got your incontinency medication right.
The decision was such a slam dunk that liberals on the court, led by Chief Justice Michael Bender, joined conservatives in the ruling, an uncommon occurrence in our state. And that gets me to my main point. In its news story on the court's ruling, The Denver Post described the plaintiff in this case, Colorado Ethics Watch (CEW), as simply "a government-watchdog group." That's like describing the Ku Klux Klan as "a concerned citizens group."
Mayor Eduardo Paes has ordered the removal of massive billboards, banner advertisements covering buildings and illegal advertising stuck to other spaces.
Hafernik came to The Chronicle's rooftop garden recently and judged it an ideal research site because the bees are isolated and protected from most creatures and people. There's also an electrical outlet, so he can plug in a light trap and see if any of our bees are drawn, zombie-like, to the light. He'll install a funnel trap, so he can collect the bees that come to the light, and take them back to his lab to wait for maggots to emerge.
"The women and children were fetching water five times a day," Kalhagen said. "And it's like a four-mile round trip."
