My first game with the All Blacks was a highlight of my career and one that sticks out in my mind—a dream come true. Ever since I was a kid I wanted to wear the All Blacks jersey, do the haka and sing the national anthem and then I got presented with my first All Blacks jersey and I ran out on to the field in Hamilton in 2003 against Wales; I managed to score a try and kicked a few goals.

Brooklyn: Voicer John McCarthy doesn't understand why President-elect Barack Obama is considered black if he's half white.

What we liked: The app and Kokee guide combine a detailed, comprehensive map of trails with contour lines and elevation data with your current location, weather and road conditions, and allows you to mark special points of interest or just leave digital bread crumbs of where you've been.

The app also displays the maps when you are offline (if there's no signal or if roaming data is expensive), but without displaying your current location.

People remember meals here. They can recount details months later, much in the way that sports enthusiasts replay the key moments of a big game.

Sneering Michael Gough plays a one-dimensional nay-sayer of Crawford's science. David Griffin — who later played Emett, skittish neighbor of Hyacinth Bouquet in the '90s Britcom "Keeping Up Appearances" — is Crawford's young ally.

As the night wore on the line grew from 10 to 50 to 200 and more. About 2 a.m. there were several hundred fans combined at the east and west booths. It was an all night party ... music, a keg and herbal essence wafting about. A police cruiser drove by at 3 a.m. and the bright search light illuminated the people and the party - everyone ground to a halt. The police car siren then wailed and the cop drove away shouting "Go Timbers" out the window.

Wrote DraftExpress.com president Jonathan Givony, "Standing 6-10 in shoes, with a 7-4 wingspan, and arguably the most impressive blend of athletic tools we've seen in a big man prospect in our nine years evaluating the NBA draft, Davis is one of the most physically gifted players on this planet at the moment. He runs the floor incredibly well, is outrageously quick and explosive off his feet, moves extremely smooth and fluidly, and perhaps best of all, is more than willing to use his gifts to his advantage on seemingly every possession."

Still, there is something to be said about a reference work that's been around for 244 years that claims to "commission work from people who know their subjects -- scholars, world leaders, expert writers -- even Nobel laureates" -- and then edits the articles and checks the facts.

Luke is young and handsome and gay, a struggling actor and a committed Christian. As far as he's concerned, there's no conflict between his faith and his sexuality - though to be fair, Luke is maybe not the brightest guy in the world.

A: Hey, Paul: 1. DE Jabaal Sheard often overpursues and leaves a big running lane on the edge. 2. I can't foresee taking Peyton Hillis off the field on third downs and replacing him with Armond Smith. 3. D'Qwell Jackson is the middle linebacker, Chris Gocong the right outside linebacker. 4. Adams had a strong camp and Young never played because of a hamstring injury. Not a tough call, in my opinion. 5. Mitchell was drafted by Tom Heckert, Williams was not. Given the fact neither has stood out, draft status usually is the tie-breaker. I don't believe Williams is eligible for practice squad.
There certainly seems to be enough jojoba for someone to make a stab at it. The rather nondescript shrub, native to the Sonoran Desert, is scattered throughout the desert Southwest. As you might expect, you'll find plenty along the Jojoba Trail, which stretches across a segment of the western shore of Bartlett Reservoir. As you make your way from the Rattlesnake Cove Recreation Site in the north to the Jojoba Boating Site in the south, you'll enjoy grand views of the reservoir as well as the cactus-studded landscape along the shore and the craggy Mazatzal Mountains that stand sentinel in the east.

Dream exterior: Poirier is proud to be a resident in one of the colorful grouping of four houses, among the oldest in Baltimore City. Her backyard garden is secluded from the hustle of life in Fells Point. A large privacy fence is painted orange, while a concrete block siding bears a colorful shade of light pink.

A small waterfall gurgles in the corner of the backyard, which is shaded by a number of trees and deciduous plants.

That makes it hard to just ignore days like yesterday, even though the numbers will be erased come April 5. The Astros simply punished the pitches Pelfrey threw over the plate and let the others go by. In the first, Pelfrey walked the leadoff man Jordan Schafer on four pitches and, one out later, gave up back-to-back, one-out, RBI doubles to Travis Buck and Carlos Lee. In the second, he gave up a one-out single, a walk and then two-run double to Jed Lowrie, an RBI single to Buck, then served up a three-run homer to Lee. In the third, with a man on third and two out, Pelfrey threw a wild pitch. And his day was done.

4. Become a 75% free throw shooter. Extra free throw points per game will significantly improve his game as follows. His extra points will increase his (average) by several points. This will bring him near the top scorer per game in the league. It will totally eliminate the practice of opposing teams deliberately fouling him to put him on the line. It will also make him the go-to guy at the end of close games when his very high shooting average makes him the most dangerous shooter on the team. Now, SVG is reluctant to go to him during this critical time. It is also obvious that simply practicing 100s of foul shots per day is NOT improving his skill. He needs to work with the best expert available to perfect the optimum technique unique to him. I hope he does this during the off season.

Sack should be awarded a Catholic medal for celebrating the good works of nuns and their close connection to the teachings and example of Christ.

Imagine what a few ill-advised tweets could do to overthrow a wayward football coach.

There’s still plenty of time left in the race for him to decide whether he wants someone like Christie, willing to go on the attack, a candidate like West to shore up concerns over Romney's loyalty to conservative ideology or the likes of Ryan to provide the brass tacks basis for Romney's economic vision. And despite what he may have said Wednesday, it's still not impossible for Rubio to change course and hop onto the ticket.

USDA officials touted the California case as proof that their random sampling works. But the agency tests only one in about 900 cattle.
