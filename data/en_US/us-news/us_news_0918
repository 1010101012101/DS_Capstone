The vibe: This laid-back restaurant is filled with bright colors such as orange, green and brown walls. There are always fresh flowers and a lighted tea candle on each table, and you'll hear anything from a Spanish love ballad to upbeat salsa music softly playing in the background. The chairs are cushioned with orange or green fabric, and there are plenty of windows all around the restaurant to add natural light. At the end of the restaurant, there is a chef's bar with hanging lights above it, where you can order to-go items from a different menu, and on the other side of the bar, close to the entrance, there is a projector that plays old Mexican movies.

The proposal has drawn widespread opposition from law enforcement agencies and municipalities, who say the ranges are not designed for public use, and some metro legislators have threatened to vote against the bill because of the provision.
You don't see hot dog stands, pie shops or pizza parlors boasting "billions sold." We buy bagged ones at fast-food joints; we eat fat, loaded ones at bars; we devour crispy-edged, smashed ones at diners; and we even pat them out and grill 'em up ourselves at home.

Home sales fell 17 percent to 250,000, well below the 700,000 rate that economists consider healthy.

To that end, he crafted the table from a birch slab supported by a tripod of animal horns at one end and the two halves of an ornamental teak sphere at the other. The sofa is from Robert Allen's custom furniture collection, which Plantard accessorized with pillows made from the same medallion fabric used in the dining room.

The Women’s team had been used to setting the standard in results for many years, but 2011 has presented them with new challenges. They had to compete in a play-in match for the last spot in the 2011 Women’s World Cup, something the USWNT hadn’t needed to do before. In their first two international matches for 2011, they lost to Sweden and England, putting their status as a dominant soccer power in jeopardy. Most prognostications for the 2011 WWC put the Americans as a team that could qualify for the championship, but they would need other clubs to lose for that to occur, as the Brazilians, Germans or French were the teams expected to advance. The Americans breezed through their first two WWC matches only to lose to Sweden in their final qualifier, but the team found resilience and character in beating the Brazilians and French to move ahead to the finals. They played exceptionally in stretches, but couldn’t put away the Japanese team, a club dealing with the devastation of their homeland from tsunamis, and the USWNT lost the final in penalty kicks. After Germany, the team had a few exhibitions scheduled to finish the season, which brought them to Portland to face their familiar North American rivals.

Ben Golliver: All the gimmicks were cute, if you like that sort of thing, but Mills hasn't really made much progress in addressing his weaknesses in running a halfcourt offense, playing defense consistently and making good decisions with the ball.

For the first several weeks of the trial in Providence, my room at the Biltmore Plaza Hotel was on the same floor as the rooms von Bulow and Mrs. Reynolds shared. For several years I had seen the two of them around New York. Although we had never spoken, we had often been at the same parties or in the same restaurants. The first day in the courtroom, von Bulow recognized me but did not acknowledge me. The second day he nodded to me in the men's room. When we met in the corridor on the fourteenth floor of the hotel, he struck up a conversation about a portable word processor I was carrying. At that moment the door to their suite opened, and Andrea Reynolds came out into the hall.

So far this theater season there's an argument to be made that the most outstanding production has been Third Rail's "Dead Funny," which tucks a bruised heart amid the laughter. It's time to make room at the top, however, with Friday's opening of "The Receptionist" at CoHo Theater. Not only is this Adam Bock play the beneficiary of similarly stellar acting and direction, it's also another deceptively mordant comedy. You might nickname this one "Torturously Funny."

Americans might be tempted to equate Radio 4 with National Public Radio, which is also lauded for its high-quality programs, but that would be incorrect, Goddard and other analysts say. Radio 4's variety eclipses that of NPR. So does its influence on British society and public life. The "Today" morning news program on Radio 4 often sets the day's national political agenda in a way that NPR's "Morning Edition" does not.
It’s best not to dwell on the conceit anyway. The idea of Coldplay — a band so eager to please it makes Maroon 5 seem like X-Ray Spex — scoring a resistance movement is ludicrous. This music puts up no resistance at all. Coldplay is like a big, happy dog that comes bounding up to you and licks your face. That dog doesn’t want to fight. He wants to play fetch.

The vast majority of Facebook users restrict updates to their friends, and do not expect those updates to appear in public search results. (In fact, many people restrict their Facebook profile from appearing at all in search results).
Jennifer Westfeldt tries to get a fresh slant on the matter in her ensemble comedy "Friends With Kids." The mildly engaging, often exasperating feature poses a few good questions and offers some well-observed moments.

The curators embrace that idea, with a diverse variety of media displayed: costumes, film, cowbells and graffiti. Everywhere I looked, my eye captured for a fleeting moment a freeze-frame of art. A passageway was not a just passageway but, when illuminated by multicolored lights, became an installation. As I looked out a window, inset into the glass was a video screen showing people looking out a window. On another screen, two men were walking through an art museum. The long, clean lines of the corridors were lighted in such a way that the people moving through them looked like walking sculpture. Casual visitors transformed, becoming abstract bodies in space, impersonating art objects.

It now says it has no problem with the 2013 standards to protect patients and staff from a building collapse. Its beef is with the 2030 standards that hospitals continue to operate after a major quake.

Woodruff Vineyard outside Corralitos is a bellwether. The 8-acre site, some 30 years old, is planted to old heritage vine selections and farmed without irrigation. It faces away from the bay, enjoying (but partly shielded from) the area's marine influence.

NEW YORK — Dominique Strauss-Kahn's reputation with women earned him the nickname "the great seducer," and not even an affair with a subordinate could knock the International Monetary Fund leader off a political path pointed in the direction of the French presidency.

The dealers sold Kinkade prints, books, collector’s plates and other ephemera, as well as paintings. Much of this activity was promoted by Kinkade’s proclaimed Christian beliefs, but by far, the biggest spur to his 21st-century success was a booming housing market.

And now, after a brief courtship, she's ready to get to work in Cleveland.
Ohio's newly drawn 9th Congressional District begins on Cleveland's West Side and hugs the coastline of Lake Erie all the way to Toledo. By yoking together the political bases of Cleveland's Dennis Kucinich and Toledo's Marcy Kaptur, that oddly drawn map also assures that at least one of the most liberal Democrats in Congress will be a lame duck after the March 6 primary.

With her two previous pictures, "Open Hearts" and "Brothers," Ms. Bier established herself as an exceptional international filmmaker. Her new one is a thrilling -- and harrowing, and beautiful -- celebration of the unpredictability of life. And, unexpectedly, it gives us the chance to see Mads Mikkelsen, who recently played Le Chiffre, the heavy in "Casino Royale," turn his dark-star power into a dramatic presence. Le Chiffre merely wept blood. Jacob is flesh and blood, in a film of rare humanity.

Knowledge of the environmental and food safety impacts of this system of food production is growing, but the rush to adopt a largely unchanged farm bill severely limits the national conversation that is needed about the future of our food system. Ohio's Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has introduced a Local Farms, Food and Jobs Act, and Iowa's Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin has submitted a Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act to strengthen the conversation about local foods and the next generation of farmers. But it remains to be seen whether the measures will be included in the bill.

"If they were not doing what they were doing, to me they'd be negligent and remiss in their duties," King said. "What they're doing with their intelligence unit is what all police departments should be doing at all levels of government. It's the job of the police department not to pick up the bodies after the attacks have been launched and carried out, but to stop those attacks from happening."
New to the Tonto National Forest trail system, and a link in the 750-mile-long Arizona Trail, the Vineyard Trail showcases an unusual side of Arizona: 25-mile-long Roosevelt Lake to the north and adjoining Apache Lake to the south.

On the day he took the oath of office nearly six years ago, Jackson left no room for doubt about his top priority. "Everything starts with education," he said at East Tech High School.
At Penn State, so many people apparently failed to act accordingly, letting themselves off the hook by "following protocol" in some cases instead of taking decisive -- and morally proper -- action to protect kids from an alleged pedophile. At Syracuse, Boeheim rolled up the drawbridge to another big-time college sports fiefdom and tossed the alleged victims into an alligator-filled moat.
His withdrawal puts the Indy 500 in danger - at the moment - of not having a full 33-car field. Shank is the 33rd entrant.

"I cannot bear the torture of Steve Chikhani's harassment in my life any longer. My son has suffered far too much and his harassment is now unbearable. I am the victim of a violent crime -- yet he is still free and we suffer. My husband has refused to allow our personal funds be used for a private investigator. Bill bought and gave me drugs years before meeting Steve, then called me crazy when I sought help, thus, I had to take matters into my own hands and was set up by Steve. I simply can't bear this any longer. Goodbye to everyone."
DPS officers arrested Hector Jose Lopez Jr., 31, on May 4 during a routine traffic stop in Casa Grande after realizing he had three outstanding misdemeanor warrants in Maricopa and Pinal counties, according to a DPS press release.
Knight, on the other hand, is a bit of a firecracker; she says whatever is on her mind and isn't afraid to be a bit silly. Her in-studio antics (like trying to get her partner to wear a bear costume) were forgiven by both Johnson and Kruse when she stepped up to the mic and consistently nailed her vocals, usually in just one take.
When Carolyn got hurt, it was really devastating to see her go down, Goodrich said. We tried to stay positive, and we knew we had a season left. We didn't want that to stop us. We were still hungry to try to make the tournament.

Besides a 50-meter competition pool, the new aquatics center has a second pool with a play apparatus. Kos said that should be a magnet for families this summer with cabañas available, with Courtney's SandCastle next door and with a private-concession miniature golf course and wave pool in the works behind Courtney's SandCastle.
"I'm by far not one of the biggest players in the water," he said. "I'm probably not the fastest. My swim times are not that great. But I have a pretty good arm and I'm pretty quick. I can get position pretty well and I can get down the pool pretty fast."

Afterward we packed up a cupcake-heavy selection of baked goods to share with colleagues.
Maybe the best way to describe it is this: For anybody who has listened to Douglas over the years — first on the radio, then on television — his voice is the sound of Oregon.
I chose to believe that despite poverty, discrimination, and hatred - none more wretched than the hatred my people inflict upon each other - I might somehow steer my ship out of troubled waters, even if it more resembled a rickety rowboat, and me being hardly some Super Negro.

Yet Houston native Wang's slow-reveal psychological drama isn't just a showcase for his excellent ensemble cast. Beautifully modulated and stylistically sui generis, "In the Family" is also one of the most accomplished and undersold directorial debuts of late.
øA: Everybody likes to pick on the FDA, and I've been known to do that myself. But the problem is not regulatory. The difficulty is that we are victims of our own success. We have developed classes of drugs in cardiovascular medicine that have revolutionized patient care. The statin drugs to lower cholesterol, now taken by 25 or 30 million Americans, have lowered the risk of heart attack, stroke and death substantially. The drugs that we have for high blood pressure, like ace inhibitors, many of which are now generic, we've had 20 years of an extraordinary run. We've reduced the age-related mortality in cardiovascular disease by 50%. There's no other field of medicine where we've done as well. And so it's harder now to innovate because the easy things have been done, and the bar is higher.

Former New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse writes about the latest challenge to the Voting Rights Act that is working its way toward the Supreme Court. Greenhouse, who now teaches at Yale Law School, notes that in 2009, the court stopped just short of suggesting that the landmark civil rights law had outlived its usefulness and instead decided a Texas case on very narrow (some might say questionable) grounds. In this new case out of Alabama, Greenhouse reports, "There appears to be no convenient off-ramp."

“The current religious exemption is probably the worst one in the country in terms of the kind of protections it provides to individuals, as well as faith groups,” Minnery said, noting that the definition of “bona fide” church may not shield a Christian bookstore owner or a Christian social work counselor from a requirement not to discriminate against gays, lesbians and transgender persons.

Often, the saddle is at the wrong height. A quick way to check is to put your heel on the pedal at the bottom of the stroke. If your leg is straight without tilting your hips, the saddle is at the right height once you ride with the ball of your foot on the pedal.
Over the past year, the campaign says, it has recruited thousands of young volunteers to help with voter outreach efforts on campuses and across the country. The campaign has dispatched high-profile Obama surrogates  including White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and campaign manager Jim Messina to a dozen campuses for student summits to promote Obama's record and listen to young voters talk about issues important to them.
The tentative compromise would extend through December the current 2 percentage-point cut in the usual 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax deducted from workers' paychecks.

Retaining Reyes last December would have made Mets fans feel so much better about the future of the franchise than will a Niese extension. But the best teams operate using minimal emotions, and cold-blooded general manager Sandy Alderson probably wouldn’t have wanted the injury-prone Reyes at nine figures no matter how large his payroll.
So Shane's starting to play the Darth Vader role, and Rick — who isn't giving up on the Sophia hunt — is like Obi-Wan Kenobi. That means that Carl is going to be like Luke Skywalker when he gets a little older and finds a lightsaber.

Maybe it just comes down to making shots. Or maybe it's a little more complicated than that. Maybe it's the difference of a team setting good screens, playing with energy from the opening tip, sharing the ball, getting to the right spots on the floor and letting the offense flow rather than forcing quick jumpers.
Both of these Rumi works were Wednesday's centerpiece. Schneider, who had originally performed "The Tavern" accompanying a proper baritone, now half sings, half recites it himself, in the style that is typical of Harry Partch's music (Johnston, as young composer, worked with and was much influenced by Partch).
The kitchen has done some soul-searching and has decided that, above all else, diners are looking for choice. There's a new, affordable lounge menu of small plates; smaller portions of hot dishes offered at dinner (so, there are regular-sized entrees $24 to $35, but small hot dishes offered at $10 to $20).

"I think it's really important to clarify the misconception that there's raw sewage spilling into the ocean right now, that's not correct," said Paloma Aguirre, a spokeswoman for the environmental group WiLDCOAST.

The only thing on my mind is losing that game.

The salmon is done when it begins to flake, about 20 minutes. But don't expect it to be falling-apart done; it's firmer than that. Also, don't pay any attention to the color; it only changes a little bit. It will still be far more orange than you're probably used to (definitely not as pink as the color called "salmon").
Solar facilities would also be subject to stricter setback and screening requirements.
Turner, Goldner's research partner, said that while most states including Missouri typically defer to IRS decisions on tax exempt status, about 20 states independently monitor their hospitals' compliance with nonprofit standards.

His latest book, he said, is about demystifying veganism and showing people that they don't need animal proteins to feel satisfied -- and that the impact on their health of making that switch will be huge.

Sophomore Deantre Lewis and junior Kyle Middlebrooks also will fight for carries. And senior receiver Jamal Miles likely will get a few every game as well.
The idea of anyone stealing any of Cruz’s moves just a few months ago was ludicrous. As he put it Tuesday, he was “basically a nobody” before catching two touchdowns in the Week 3 victory over the Eagles.

The 2010 graduation rate was significantly understated as a result, she said. "The 2011 rate was probably closer to accurate" but still contains systematic errors, she said.
Except that it's new. McCarthy told me he had replaced the old bar's Formica countertop and taken out the fluorescent lighting. And he'd raised expectations by promising an upscale tavern. Though Lighthouse doesn't look like a "liquor store" anymore (his words to describe Sports Cafe), it hasn't settled on a look that is modern or upscale, and so it fails to meet its own standards.
The poster of Clark supposedly flashing a nude statue was produced in 1978 and already famous by the time he ran for mayor. It became a collector's item after he was elected.

So as Gabriel nibbled on a pancake and listened, Miller talked about his wife's lifetime love affair with education and how that has impacted his plans for the council seat he took over in January. He said he will use his post to raise awareness of the benefits of early learning and to advocate for state funding of such programs. He is planning forums to make sure low-income parents know what programs are available and plans to work with new Deputy Mayor of Education Jason Kloth to heighten the issue's profile.

The coworker kicked Quinlan several times, trying to break the current and knock him off the line without electrocuting himself.

Although Schmid would certainly insist that the expansion Timbers play the part of Rocky Balboa to Seattle’s Apollo Creed, from this corner I would say the offensively-challenged Sounders (they’re struggling with major injury issues) were quite fortunate to have escape Saturday night’s meeting at Qwest Field with a 1-1 draw.
A tornado warning is issued only when a tornado is indicated on radar or a tornado or funnel cloud is sighted by trained spotters.

"It's a long season," he said. "The fact that they take everyone's best shot so well night-in and night-out, is amazing to me. I think maybe it's just a matter that they're on the road and a younger team, these guys aren't used to this as much.
