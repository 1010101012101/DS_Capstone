That puts an end to the 2012 end-of-the-world myth in plain English. But just in case, I called former NASA astronaut and engineer Jose Hernandez, who confirmed categorically that the Earth will still orbit the sun at the end of the year.
Chez Panisse has trained a lot of disciples in its 40-plus years, but no one is as true to the cause as Russell Moore. He cooked at the restaurant for two decades before going out on his own four years ago with Allison Hopelain. Each of his three main courses, which change nightly, is cooked over open flames in the altar-like kitchen. It could be grilled pork leg paired with smoked shoulder; mushrooms with beets and farro roasted in the wood oven; or a half Dungeness crab grilled in the fireplace. Moore has created a serious temple of food; even the dining room feels a bit monastic. Two 30-foot redwood tables cut from one tree are framed by chairs that came from a church in England.

The festival dwindled in popularity in the late 1960s as interest in rock music peaked, Wein says. After rowdy fans crashed the gates at the 1971 jazz festival, the city of Newport shut down both concerts. The folk festival wouldn't return until 1985.
“Graveyard,” a 3- by 8-foot charcoal drawing by Lia Petronia, needs to be mentioned not only for the artist’s drawing skill, but for her inventiveness.

Addiction experts label compulsive shopping and spending as a serious disease that can cost the afflicted their relationships, jobs, homes and other prized possessions, all the while racking up massive debts, usually on high-interest credit cards. Plus, while men are more likely than women to be addicted to drugs and alcohol, research shows that compulsive shopping affects mostly women. As with other addictions, the spending addict continues to spend and shop in the face of adverse consequences. Sometimes referred to as "shopaholism", compulsive shopping can create massive financial, marital, legal and family problems. These consequences are identical in nature to the consequences created from drug addiction and alcoholism.

The issue of disaster tourism isn’t new. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, companies began offering tours of areas that were especially hard hit after the storm and the levee failures. After the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, photos showed tourists sunbathing on Asian beaches while cleanup continued in the background. More than 200,000 people were killed in that calamity, many ripped from the arms of loved ones and swept to their deaths. Some thought the sunbathers insensitive.
Yes, New York City has some marvelous things to do and see as well -- and we enjoy many of them when we're there. But what would consist of an entire day's excursion in New York, is so easy here.

The trip was sold by National Geographic Expeditions, which each year offers at least one and sometimes four around-the-world tours by private jet, a leased Boeing 757-200 that is configured with only 77 super-large and dreamily comfortable seats.

My last chore of the day was to interview a man who is a hero to at least a third of the American electorate: Michael Moore.

No word yet how a settlement by West Virginia would affect the status of Pittsburgh and Syracuse. Both schools are leaving the Big East to join the ACC but were waiting out the league’s 27-month exit window. Would both schools and the ACC be willing to pay enough a fee to allow both school’s to leave in 2012? Probably not. That would be a major expense for the ACC to take on at this time when it can hold steady for another season.

If I can point to one thing, it's this: Ask yourself if an isolated incident is being treated as a trend. Ask if something that has happened once or twice is "out of control" or "an epidemic." Just asking yourself that question can be very calming. The second (suggestion) is, think about the person who is trying to convey the scary message. How are they trying to benefit, what do they want you to buy, who do they want you to vote for? That (question) can help a lot.

Next, I ferret out a single, 2-inch enamel-on-copper earring on which a creamy angel's gold-tinged wings soar across an azure sky. The earring is well-crafted. Elegant. The last item unearthed is a St. Christopher's medal.

The American burying beetle was the nation's first insect to be designated as endangered. The nocturnal insect literally buries its food, the carcasses of insects, mice, opossums, birds, snakes and other animals.

Reid, who played at Glendale Community College, took the heat for much of the underachieving team's woes, which began with a 4-8 start and ended with Philadelphia missing the playoffs even after showing significant improvement down the stretch to finish 8-8. But regardless of the fan and media pressure — a group of fans took to camping out across the street from the Eagles' practice facility with a banner calling for Reid's firing early in the team's four-game losing streak that began in the second week of the season — owner Jeffrey Lurie chose to stay the course.

Elise still seems downbeat -- maybe it's the sick-dog thing? She picks Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," but just can't connect with the song. She's not blowing the notes or anything, but she oversings, which completely kills the sensuality required for the tune. The judges don't like it, either, and then Elise tries to defend herself, which almost never works on "Idol." This did not go well.

Cons: Back in the 1980s, this show may have seemed fresh and exotic, as proved by the video clip reel in the beginning that shows countless movies, TV shows and news accounts attesting to its longevity and one-time place in the pop culture. Today, though, Crazy Girls feels cheap and rote, performed on a tiny stage and featuring bad lip-synching and worse wigs. There's one performer who so overacts and seems so spastic that we worried she might be having some sort of attack. The whole thing, from the dingy theater to the penis-shaped pillow prop, was cliche and low-rent.

Each episode ends with a dramatic tear-filled tour of the new home, packed with donated furnishings, and outsize extras like a carousel or bowling lanes.
"I said to the players after the game, playing regular-season games is one thing. But when you play the same opponent night after night, it tells you a lot about your team and about individuals on your team. We have some guys, quite frankly, they just need to play better.

A: The only alternative to removal is to leave them alone. There are two different schools of thought regarding the removal of wisdom teeth. One group recommends prophylactic removal prior to the development of any problems, and the other recommends waiting until a problem develops and removing them at that time. Unfortunately for the "wait and see" group, recovery from the surgery is usually quicker and easier for younger patients. Some wisdom teeth should never be removed if there is a high probability of damaging the underlying nerve, or causing an extensive loss of the bone surrounding the tooth.

"We have to demonstrate that we are serious about fixing our broken immigration system, we have to secure the border, we have to enforce our laws, and then I think the natural compassion of the American people will kick in, and they'll let us deal with these sympathetic situations like these kids who are not culpable, but were brought here by their parents and find themselves at a dead end," Cornyn said.

My favorite pasta dish is the rustic Bucatini All'Amatriciana ($17). A hollow, fat spaghetti is tossed with a spicy red sauce built on guanciale, an Italian bacon made from pork cheeks that are cured in-house. The fat from the bacon is then rendered down to sauté red onions and Calabrian chilies. A white wine is used to deglaze the pan, a house tomato sauce is added and pecorino cheese is stirred in to thicken things up. The flavors are fantastic. I've already been back to order it again.

"Reading Under the Influence" is the sort of sitcom-style comedy that used to be a regular feature on Broadway. This one manages to score a few laughs with some amusing, up-to-the-minute one-liners -- as when the network execs advise the women to refer to Kindles rather than books.

Gardner interviewed Sanders immediately after the incident. The officer testified that the ex-NFL star told him that he was in a kitchen area attached to his bedroom in his end of the house when Pilar Sanders began to kick at the kitchen door.

More than a dozen former gymnasts, speaking publicly for the first time, told the Register how they were physically or sexually abused by some of the sport's top coaches, men they had come to depend on for their athletic success and personal safety.

In choosing sites, Google is looking for wide community support and readiness, said Meinrath, who has been talking with the company about the project. Google doesn't want to spend time dealing with right of way issues or objections from neighborhoods that aren't crazy about having Google tear up streets to install its network. In 2007, Google abandoned a much simpler plan, to offer Wi-Fi in San Francisco, after getting bogged down in the municipal bureaucracy.

Jess taught me how to make elemental measurements and helped me interpret my findings. She had also collected some complimentary data, and when we put it all together the project got much stronger. At the end of my first year I wrote about our joint work in a paper, along with the help of a few other researchers, and it became the first chapter of my dissertation.

One woman, a member of the congregation, stood in the church's driveway and looked at the still-smoking church with fixed and tear-filled eyes. She told the woman next to her that she was sick to her stomach.
That said, adults often misdiagnose themselves. By one estimate, only about a third of grown-ups who think they have ADD actually do. One expert suspects many actually have attention deficit trait, or ADT, a modern malady caused by our techno way of life, which makes it normal to read e-mails while talking on the phone and eating chili. Computers, cell phones and social networking have made the world one big, distracting circus -- and created a new kind of multitasking stress that our bodies and minds simply aren't built for.

Leport said she and her colleagues have been amazed at how many people with high-superior autobiographical memory have come forward since the UC Irvine first presented a case study of one woman -- given the pseudonym A.J. -- was published in 2006. The UC Irvine team, working under the leadership of memory pioneers James McGaugh and Larry Cahill, have spent several years confirming the accuracy of those memories (checking them against calendars, newspaper accounts and personal diaries in many cases) and characterizing this unique population -- most of whom noticed they had an unusual talent around the age of 11 or 12, according to Leport.

Kelly said Lariviere's contract is only for one year because of uncertainties posed for the UO, Oregon State University and Portland State University by the governance changes proposed in the legislative proposals from the state board and the governor. The regional universities probably would not be affected much by those changes, he said.
But among the prospective candidates, Romney clearly has the current advantage. The former Massachusetts governor and billionaire founder of Bain Capital has made the most energetic use of state PACs, a tactic that has helped him raise more than $9.2 million in the last two years in large- and small-dollar contributions. He's used those funds to woo supporters in key states and pay staff who make up the backbone of his campaign team.
I see these tips before every major travel holiday. I'm actually grateful to ExxonMobil for one thing: It understands what so many others - and I include travel writers like me - don't. A vast majority of summer vacations will be domestic road trips. Only a fraction of us will fly. So the talk about fees and high fares doesn't really apply to most travelers. We're grounded.
"Sally MacLennane" was a standout track from the Irish folk-punk group's wildly energetic and brilliantly poetic 1985 album, "Rum, Sodomy and the Lash" (coproduced by Elvis Costello). The band never topped it, and hasn't, in fact, released a new studio album since 1996 (though troubled frontman Shane MacGowan, who went solo in the early '90s, has participated in occasional reunion tours since 2001).
Despite these triumphs, fewer than 20 of the several hundred GOP lawmakers who served in the House with Gingrich are publicly backing his White House bid. And as Ohio's presidential primary approaches, Gingrich is getting more criticism than support from his former colleagues in the Buckeye State.

Carlson's slower, more deliberate approach has drawn praise from those involved and others outside the archdiocese, who say the input will help the effort if some of the action steps don't sit well with parishioners.
Jordan often invented slights by others to increase his motivation. When it got truly personal with him, he didn't feed off anything but his internalized resentments and competitive rage. Those he channeled into nearly unimaginable displays of dominance.

If the reporter spent time asking Keibler about what it's like to one day to progress from Towson student to Ravens cheerleader to being photographed at the Oscars on the arms of one of the most sought-after men on the planet, it didn't make it into the story. What you will find is a lot of the writer's enthusiasm for Keibler's looks, her sports fandom, her lack of pretense.
Sarah King died, apparently of natural causes, Nov. 13 in her home. Her husband died that same day at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from the injuries suffered during the attack.
Directed by Tlaloc Rivas, the hour-long comedy actually tells the story of "The Tempest," more or less. The traditional "Tempest" shines as soon as hipster Miranda Elana Kepner, with blue streaks in her hair and stars in her eyes) meets preppy Ferdinand (Michael Amoroso, who played the same role in New Line Theatre's rock and roll "Tempest," "Forbidden Planet"). Bell even gives them some of the "real" words to say.

Wolfe, a Mizzou graduate, was out to prove he was right for the job and familiar with the state's public university system that includes 72,000 students.

However, the jury considering Edwards' fate heard nothing about the financial request, made about three weeks before his June 2011 indictment on six counts related to alleged campaign finance violations. As a prosecutor questioned Willis  librarian of a vast private botanical library located on Mellon's 2,100-acre Virginia estate  one of Edwards' defense lawyers objected. The judge then sent the jury from the room until she could hear what the witness had to say.
he wants you to sound like him. So the singer, songwriter and producer hit CES to show off his I Am T-Pain mic. The microphone is a follow-up to his I Am T-Pain app for the iPhone, made by Smule, that simulates the Auto-Tune vocal effect for which T-Pain is known. T-Pain's mic, which will arrive in stores this summer and will sell for $39.99, gives singers an on-the-spot Auto-Tune filter, enabling them to sound somewhat like T-Pain's modified voice in his hit songs. The app sells for 99 cents.

Govorukhin could hardly imagine how the whole thing could haunt the current campaign more than three decades later.
Cameron Diaz makes a glorified cameo as the office assistant who researches social ills the Hornet and Kato set out to solve. And look for Edward Furlong as a strung-out villainous underling. They, at least, have parts too small to share the blame that this soon-to-be-infamous flop will warrant.
The 1,500 field in America is deeper than it's been in years. The latest crop is led by Leo Manzano, Matt Centrowitz and Lopez Lomong -- all younger than Webb. Then there's three-time Olympian Bernard Lagat, 38 and still going strong.

The fragile liberal-conservative alliance opposing the rule on contraceptive coverage seems unlikely to hold for long, much less to extend to other issues on which Catholics at either end of the spectrum may find common ground.

As a redshirt junior, she contracted a life-threatening case of bacterial meningitis that caused partial hearing loss and forced her to miss several games.
What are the council’s goals? No one has a clue. The fact that many of its key figures are former Khadafy cronies suggests that it may herald less in the way of democratic reform and more of the same old corruption and money-greased accommodation with Britain and France. Personality conflicts and rivalries among its members also are likely to make any concerted action by the new government difficult, if not impossible.
State officials said they are wary of estimates of electronic pulltab revenue and have already scaled back expectations. The practice of selling paper pulltabs -- allowing Minnesotans to peel off paper tabs to see their winnings in a game of chance -- has seen revenue fall sharply, with gross receipts down $400 million in the past five years.
This was the world, then, in which the Arthur poem emerged. That explains (to me, at any rate) why it contains so much feverish, elaborate praise of Arthur and his knights and so many celebrations of their unified military courage. The poem yearns for a reality that didn't exist.

Researchers are starting to realize that in some cases, ADHD only becomes apparent in middle and high school, when student life gets more complicated and classes become more demanding. Hyperactivity often wanes as children reach adolescence, but teens are expected to deal with multiple teachers and be more independent and organized. Those who were able to muddle through elementary school may lack the attention skills needed to cope, Vitiello says.

On Saturday, Griffin may not have been the most absorbing athlete from his own school. Baylor running back Terrance Ganaway is charming, 239 pounds, eloquent and bespectacled. Asked about his 200-yard, five-touchdown rushing performance in Baylor's absurd 67-56 win against Washington in the Alamo Bowl, Ganaway said: "The O-line was amazing. My only job was not to hit my head on the goalpost."
Make no mistake, we don't relish the prospect of paying more money to the government in these challenging times. We suspect others will feel strongly about that. Already, Senate President Thomas V.

How did the committee system die? It was actually an accidental death, caused by commendable efforts to open Congress and empower individual members. In the 1970s, a series of internal congressional reforms, beginning with the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, sought to decrease the tremendous power held by committee chairs. At that time, chairmanships were determined by seniority, and the most senior members came from the safest seats. For Democrats, the majority party of the time, that meant seats held by conservative Southern Democrats. An increasingly liberal Democratic Party bristled under the agenda control those chairmen exercised.

Crisafulli has supported the online-travel industry's position.
Fredley Saurel, aka Freddie GZ, was born in Jacmel on the Caribbean coast of Haiti and currently lives in South Carolina. In between, he grew up in East Orange, and spent plenty of time in Newark. His crime-caper video for "Trap Talk" was shot in and around New Jersey -- the Journal Square PATH Station, the Trump Tower, the Jersey City waterfront and the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, Teterboro, and an unnamed Newark neighborhood all make appearances. But the music is resolutely Southern -- influenced by Trick Daddy, Young Buck, and the Atlantan g-rapper Pill. The production suggests familiarity with DJ Khaled, too, and Saurel did live and work in Miami-Dade for awhile. Freddie cut a song two years ago called "City Going Ham" that felt like a response to Pill's wild "Trap Going Ham," even if it wasn't anything of the sort. "Trap Talk" is a return to similar subject matter, much of which is bleeped out in the YouTube version below, but which can be accessed in its purple glory at this vimeo link:

Last year alone, more than 300 Mexicans died in their attempt to enter the United States for employment reasons. The Mexican government has the obligation to take all possible actions to avoid the loss of lives. A guide produced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically for this purpose has been misunderstood as an attempt to foster undocumented immigration. This is not the case; the Mexican government is respectful of the laws of the United States.

And, although few know it, there were times when, in the teeth of the emotional storm that swirls around every coach for every day of the season, he would leave his Jersey Meadowlands office in the dead of night, drive his Lincoln through the darkness down to Sea Girt and sit on a bench overlooking the ocean with a container of coffee in his hand and the weight of an approaching Sunday on his mind.
This is the nature of Pinot: It's a spectacularly frustrating and elusive vino, and it's very difficult to predict when it's the right time to drink. Pinot noir is the most "living" grape ever produced. The changes that true Pinot goes through in minutes, hours and years are wild. In Burgundy, France, by law all reds must be made with 100 percent Pinot Noir. This is a commonly adhered-to practice, though historically some wineries "blended" Pinot Noir with the riper, spicier and dark Syrah from the Rhone Valley just to the south. This beefed up and popularized the otherwise fickle and light-colored wines made from 100 percent Pinot.

The U.S has enjoyed a bounty of natural gas for the past few years thanks to advances in well drilling that have allowed energy companies to tap vast, petroleum-soaked layers of shale rock. The boom in production wasn't as noticeable at first, Smith said, because of unseasonably warm summers and cold winters that forced homeowners to use more gas.

Between Dana Point to the south and Marina del Rey to the north, there are five places to catch a ferry for Catalina. But you probably want the shortest boat ride possible, and that means starting in Long Beach with the Catalina Express. It's an hourlong voyage (usually about $70 per adult, round-trip) and it ends in sleepy Avalon Bay. Catalina, you'll soon find, is a strange and charming land where golf carts far outnumber cars, where tourists often outnumber the island's roughly 3,700 residents, where buffalo (imported for a movie shoot in the 1920s) roam the back-country. You need to know that you'll run out of town to explore pretty quickly, you'll see some steep prices summer weekends, and you may not want your kids splashing in the shallows around Avalon's green pier. (That beach ranked among the state's ten most polluted beaches in a 2011 study by Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay.) But the island is fetching, from its distinctive tilework to its signature 1929 casino building (which houses a little museum and big movie screen)s, and there's just enough here to fill a family weekend, or a romantic one. And the history is hard to resist, beginning with 1919, when chewing-gum mogul William Wrigley Jr. bought a controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Co. Western author and sportsman Zane Grey (whose old house is a hotel now) summered here in the '20s and '30s. Actress Natalie Wood drowned here on a 1981 boat trip with husband Robert Wagner and friend Christopher Walken. And teen bride Norma Jean Dougherty lived here briefly in the 1940s before divorcing and renaming herself Marilyn Monroe.
First, she sat with a whiteboard and gave me an explanation of wind dynamics fit for an aeronautics expert, tack, gybe, and lots of other cool terms I've already forgotten. She pointed out a faraway sailboat and illustrated what she meant - upwind, downwind, beam. I loved that she explained the philosophy behind everything. I need things to make sense in my brain before I can carry them out in my body. Then, she demonstrated on land. So far, so good.

GPS technology is pivotal to what is essentially a trackdown plot. In that sense "Headhunters" is a digital update of Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 classic "The Conversation," with Roger's head—what's on it, rather than what's in it—as an analog to the apartment that Gene Hackman's surveillance expert tears apart in a frantic attempt to find a bug. The intricacies of the book, as adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg, track lucidly enough, with Roger going through all sorts of hell for reasons he can't comprehend. Still, there comes a point when the movie must be taken at its word that everything is working out as it's supposed to.

"Sgt. Yu, Officers Perea, Meyer (3A6), and Bowie (3L4) responded to FOP at the request of OFD who were handling a medical call of a protester that climbed upon a structure and fell 14' below. As preplanned, officers staged and entered together leaving two officers at a distance as observers. The other two officers attempted to make way to OFD/Patient but were confronted with profanity, name calling, and chants.

About 30 protesters formed a skirmish type line preventing officers from getting access to the OFD/Patient. OFD then canceled OPD assistance. The two officers were followed out of FOP will similar chants. OPD cleared w/o further incident. PDRDs were activated. MDT "officer safety" message was sent by 3L81 to BFO1 personnel, referencing the incident and required Sgt notification prior to respond to FOP."
The much celebrated elder Cronkite, who died in 2009, remains a spectral presence around CBS, his picture and name ubiquitous. Though the network still aspires to Cronkite's standard, Pelley said media figures can't expect to be nearly as revered. Being labeled the voice of the mainstream now amounts to an epithet, for some.
“It’s a matchup that I knew that I had a pretty good shot against him,” Cruz said after the Giants' 20-17 overtime victory in the NFC Championship Game. “Coming from the last game (against him), I did some pretty good things.
