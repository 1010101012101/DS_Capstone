“In 2009, we thought we had a pretty deep team and we ended up 8-8, because we went out and got some free agents,” Reese said. “That isn’t always the way to do it.

Favorite book: The "Harry Potter" series by J.K. Rowling because there is obviously the entertaining aspect of it, with the vivid imagery and amazing storyline. The Harry Potter series is one that you can always learn from, whether you are a 10-year-old starting the first few pages of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone" or an 18-year-old waiting in line for "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" on the night it is released. Some of my favorite quotes and inspirations come from the words embedded within the pages full of humor, friendship and the "magic" of life.

And in this March 12 post, she described having to take Nolan home first, and having to leave Brooks for a few more days in the neonatal intensive care unit: “I think that after the pregnancy -- wondering if the babies were alive everyday, this was the hardest part of the whole experience.

Youkilis is thinking about fall, particularly with a salad in which the plate is paved with thin slices of persimmons, serving as a foil to watercress dressed with a pomegranate vinaigrette and bright ruby-like seeds ($8).

The unity of being New Jerseyans was one of the greatest gifts NJN gave us. Once again, we are half New York, half Philadelphia. In a short time, the effects of our loss will be sharply felt. It is laughable to think that WNET could ever fill that up-front, close and personal void.
There's a simple way to gauge how much protein you need daily: Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.4. If you're 165 pounds, that's about 66 grams of protein each day.

Elite athletes may need somewhat more protein than the rest of us, but most Americans get plenty of protein.

“I’m lucky I’ve worked with great composers — Bernstein, Kander and Ebb, Cy Coleman, Charles Strouse. I get an idea. Sometimes it’s their idea. Once Sondheim called. His friend George Furth had written seven plays as an evening for Kim Stanley. Would I read it? I did and said, ‘Something’s wrong with seven plays. It’s more about Kim’s makeup, wigs, costume changes than about the material.’ Three of them centered on marriage. I saw a musical. A strangely shaped musical about marriage.

The telling thing is that the plot of "Date Night" only requires that Carell and Fey live in a suburb outside Manhattan. They could be a dull, unhappy couple from Westchester.

The raw "cheesecake" tart we had for dessert one night, however, didn't work.

It's easy to be negative. (In fact, that's actually the official slogan of Sunday Spin.) To put a positive face on what the Browns didn't do at wide receiver requires a belief in the current group of pass catchers and even more trust in the Browns' talent evaluators.

QUESTION: In 1978, I shared a platonic beer with a young woman whom I'll call "J." Our friendship was kind of brother-and-sister. Recently, we ran into one another at a Rod Stewart concert. This platonic relationship has gotten very, very close to the next level and it feels so weird on both ends. Do we proceed to enter into a place where there is no turning back or do we keep our incredible platonic friendship? P.S. Her lips are softer than any lips I've ever kissed.

The last time these teams played in Portland, Aldridge tied his career high with 36 points. That was last month. "I don't think that's a good thing," Wolves point guard Luke Ridnour said. "He likes to play against us." Perhaps most telling about this one: Wolves center Darko Milicic had the best fighting chance in guarding Aldridge, the No. 2 pick in the 2006 draft. Milicic provided 22 points, eight rebounds and four blocks, even though he couldn't contain Aldridge on the defensive end.

Did a person or computer match the unreadable license plate to mine because it was similar?

"Men in Black 3": When a franchise stumbles on a crazy-good idea for its latest installment, attention must be paid. So hats off to director Barry Sonnenfeld and his team for this concept, which reunites Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and then shifts gears by having J, with the future of the world at stake, take a time-travel trip to the pre-Watergate Nixon era. There, he finds another version of his old partner with the same grim determination, deadpan mien and minimalist conversation -- a young K played by Josh Brolin.

But even though it is true that the people who run Hollywood love the grosses that a superhero movie or a high-tech thriller or a teenage sex comedy bring into the studio coffers, the industry has had a sense of reserve and higher purpose that goes back to the movies' early days. The very first movie moguls, Louis B. Mayer, William Fox and the Warner brothers, to name a few, didn't gain traction in the business by talking down to their audience but by talking up to it. They eschewed cheesy movies for more elegant fare — pictures like the religious epic "Ben Hur" for MGM, the Dickens' adaptation "Oliver Twist" for Fox and Oscar Wilde's "Lady Windemere's Fan" for Warners. They raised the movies' status and their own in the process.

When the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, they passed a stimulus bill that directed huge resources toward the preservation of public employee jobs. At least one dollar in four in the stimulus bill went to states or cities to directly preserve government jobs, to create new public sector jobs (via "shovel-ready projects") or to protect those jobs by paying the burgeoning Medicaid bills that might otherwise have required states to reduce their work forces to pay for health care. This may have pleased the Democrats' political base, but it didn't address the real employment problems.

So he believes now is the time for him to make a push for a new contract, given the regret he has over signing the last one - a contract reported as being worth $41 million, though Umenyiora said today that figure is inflated by escalators and bonuses he didn't achieve.

Once parents sign petitions, their signatures shouldn't be subject to changes of mind. But that's true only if there has been a sensible and transparent process to provide them with complete information. The state board should refine the rules for trigger petitions. All parents should be officially notified about trigger campaigns affecting their school; that's not the way it currently works. And before they sign anything, parents should have an opportunity to attend open forums where they can hear from both sides, ask questions, challenge assumptions and debate details. Parent-driven school reform shouldn't be subject to misinformation or lack of information, or depend on which argument was heard most recently.

True enough. During season 6 of "Top Chef," Isabella came across as a buffoonish and perhaps misogynistic character who would be more at home on "Jersey Shore" than in the kitchen.

At times, I thought he was a great fit for John Beilein’s system with his ability to be a stretch power forward and knock down shots. His rebounding had really improved this year. I’m a big fan of his game. As someone that follows Michigan basketball really closely, I was disappointed.”

If you prefer history with monks mixed in, visit Holy Island. This small dot off the coast of northern England, near the Scottish border, was the home and original burial ground of St. Cuthbert, a great missionary monk and leader of the early Christian church in Northern England.

By the ninth century, Viking raids forced the monks to take shelter in Durham, but they returned centuries later to re-establish a church on this holy site.
