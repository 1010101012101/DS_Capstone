Without that kind of assurance, counties could find themselves with a diminishing amount of state aid to handle the felons left on their doorstep, increasing the risk of earlier releases from custody with less supervision.

Although the beetle doesn't directly threaten agricultural crops or forests, it could trigger a damaging domino effect. Preying heavily on beneficial insects, or crowding them out, could leave crops more vulnerable to pests. Plants gain protection from a variety of native predators to check plant-eating insects. When a single exotic species dominates, it can't match the range of prey and activity period of a broad mix of native species.

There are 14,000 more or less autonomous school districts. Kline knows that at this moment of waning confidence in the federal government, it is strange to assume that leverage from a combination of national tests and national money can efficiently improve the system.

Five years after their diagnosis, almost 74% of the women diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy were still alive. Among their sisters who were not pregnant when they got treatment, 55.75% survived to the five-year mark.

Other Occupy leaders say they're planning big protests during the Group of Eight economic conference in May.

If the Occupy movement is to have much influence over that contest, it will probably have to do something its leaders have so far resisted: get organized.

Fister will be back, perhaps as early as Monday. Porcello has put together two solid starts after his debacle in the doubleheader against the Rangers. So really, the concern or panic rests squarely on the shoulders of Scherzer. Is he going to pitch like an All-Star as he did in the first half last season?

Jones saw a flaw in Porcellos mechanics and the pitcher delivered a terrific start on Monday night. Jones and Scherzer say that theyve found a hitch in his delivery. Lets hope thats it.

There'll always be plenty of George Bushes and John Kerrys to go around; the Crips and the Bloods will trot them out every four years whether we like it or not. But a voice in the wilderness, like the still, small voice within, is a song to be savored while we have it, whether we're listening or not, and when we have lost it, we should mourn for ourselves.

You are correct: It is a dangerous practice. Contrary to popular belief, expressway underpasses do not offer safe shelter from the high winds of severe thunderstorms.

Misconceptions about the safety of underpasses probably originated with a widely circulated video of motorists rushing to an underpass to avoid a tornado that was crossing Interstate Highway 35 near Wichita, Kansas, on April 26, 1991.

In the second half, however, Lawson scored just seven points on 2-of-8 shooting as the Lakers figured him out. Can he get back to creating havoc for a Nuggets team that needs him to run the show, and run it well?

"We broke the Taliban's momentum," Obama said. "We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al-Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set - to defeat al-Qaida, and deny it a chance to rebuild - is within reach."

Ray Ratto, CSN Bay Area: "Ultimately, the San Jose Sharks were most guilty of being themselves for 87 games – a maddening team capable of much, delivering less, and being unable to alter either themselves or their opponents. So it was in Game The Last, a 3-1 loss to St. Louis that showed San Jose at its tenacious best and its inexplicable worst – in many ways their season in a 60-minute compression."
The nation's natural gas supplies rose last week, the government said Thursday.

A new Gallup Poll finds that Obama is the most politically polarizing president in recent history, with 88 percent of Democrats approving of his job performance while just 23 percent of Republicans do. He has the twin political challenges of giving Democratic lawmakers an agenda they can rally around in this midterm election year, yet showing emboldened Republicans and a skeptical public that he is serious about reversing Washington's off-putting partisanship.

However, the reality is, long-term financial sustainability in the City of Detroit must still be achieved. This will be hard work, and there are no quick fixes.

Concerns that weaker European countries like Greece would default on debt pounded stocks and the euro for much of May and in recent weeks. Traders have started to put aside some of their worries about Europe although the market is still susceptible to troubling headlines. On Monday, stocks gave up steep gains, partly because Moody's cut its rating on Greece's debt to "junk" status.
All 720 freshmen began using iPads in January as part of an expanded pilot program aimed at bolstering learning and helping students navigate a world defined by evolving technology. Administrators determined that student iPad use this school year resulted in fewer D's and F's and more A's and B's, particularly in math. Consequently, they recommended expanding the program to include sophomores next year. The cost of purchasing an additional 800 iPads is expected to be about $369,000 and will be paid out of the district's technology budget.
Assuming Trubisky will indeed be an OSU Buckeye is an unwise leap of faith over complicated waters. The recruiting of a college quarterback has many layers, and Trubisky is trying his best to sort them out the final weeks of his junior year.

Track and field, unlike every other sport, is black and white. It is a sport where you are measured by only time, leaving no room for interpretation. This makes the Pioneer relay teams successes even more impressive. The Pioneers have asserted themselves with two New Balance National qualifying teams, an unprecedented feat for a high school of New Providence’s size. In exceeding all preconceived conceptions of the spring track season, these Pioneers have become five of the most successful New Providence athletes in the school’s 52-year history.

All three candidates returned completed questionnaires, and their responses indicate significant similarities on the issues. They all oppose a constitutional shift from a flat income tax to a progressive income tax, gay marriage and the expansion of gambling in Illinois. They uniformly cite job creation and tax relief as top priorities. Rowe and Gaffney support reducing public employee benefits going forward - as does McSweeney, albeit with reservations. He prefers an alternative plan that would eliminate all pensions for legislators and making a 401(k)-style retirement option available to all public employees.

Garrett Reuter is preoccupied with a small dimpled white ball. So much so that in 1980 he bought a home in Belleville not only because he liked its English Tudor style but also because it was located on a golf course. "I can walk right over to the fourth fairway." He decorated the home - and his law office - in what some might call Traditional Golf style. Furnishings range from dynamic oil paintings by noted American sports artist Stephen Holland to golf-themed console and cocktail tables by Hooker Furniture under the PGA TOUR Home collection.
Though Tennant describes her current schedule as part time, her discovery in 1993 set off a whirlwind. One minute she was an art-school grad with a nose ring being shot as a real person by Steven Meisel for British "Vogue," and a week later the photographer had cast her for Versace's ad campaign. "It was crazy," she recalls. "I didn't have an agency. I wasn't trying to model." A lucrative contract with Chanel a couple years later cemented her supermodel status.

Still on the outside looking in are the titans of progressive rock, metal and post-punk who the Hall has always snubbed. Rush, Yes and Kiss are perennially overlooked; with each year, the exclusion of these iconic groups looks increasingly silly. Black Sabbath was finally included in the Hall after a long and torturous road to induction, but the Hall has no time for Judas Priest or Iron Maiden. The Smiths — the most influential British rock band of the ’80s — are not enshrined in the Hall. Nor is Joy Division, a band that exerts profound influence over the sound of contemporary rock.

That's why, to critics like Haddock and Sullivan, the debate is about something greater than horse manure. City Hall has been reminded that the only thing Norconians love as much as their horses is being left alone.

Seau, 43, was found dead in his beachfront home in Oceanside last week.
That made "Nocturnal Path," a graceful 45-minute dance drawn from Buddhist ritual, an appropriate program closer. Set in four parts -- a sacramental rite with lanterns and a large copper basin in "Offering," fast leaps, angular legs and slashing arms in "Chaos," meditative walks pooling the stage in "Emptiness" and a rigorously detailed duet by Tran and Mann in "Becoming" -- the dance is visually opulent in its shimmering silk costumes and innovative use of ribbons in an applause-garnering cats-cradle feat. But it feels hostage to its score, with sections stretched out to accommodate the length of a song.

"One primate death, you could attribute to a fluke, but when you start to see multiple primate deaths within the same facility, this becomes what can only be described as a pattern of negligence," he said. "And if they can’t do basic things like staying with the animal when it is restrained or making sure there isn’t an animal in the cage before it is put in the cage washer, you have to question their ability to do anything scientific. ... This calls in to question the validity of any kind of testing they are doing."

Hale's illness progressed much more quickly than her friend's, robbing her of the ability to speak or breathe on her own. She's able to remove the respirator tubes for up to an hour, which is how she is able to manage the jump. Hale has maintained her connection with the world through an $18,000 DynaVox artificial voice, which she will soon have to activate by blinking her eyes. She murmurs and sighs every few seconds, as if the words were pooling in her throat, then, suddenly, the words come pouring out electronically.
"The goal was to keep the original intent and not change the existing texture," Armour said. "The improvement list is quite long. For instance, updating the stucco on the exterior was a huge job. Most of the roof was replaced, and the lower level now has a gorgeous wine cellar."

Unlike other mediums, video games let players create their own narratives. They become, in effect, co-authors of the "Mass Effect" saga. They helped write this tale. They're the ones who formed relationships with their crewmates. They determined the fate of the galaxy.
