Alex White's arrest last weekend was embarrassing. Both incidents were, and the players were told as much. The team felt White's reaction showed accountability, given that he addressed the manager, GM and players. Teams are limited in the discipline that can be exercised, and MLB has no policy in place.

Is "This Will Have Been: Art, Love & Politics in the 1980s" an exhibition for people who were not alive when Reaganomics heralded a new era of luxury and disparity? When the cultural revolutions of the '60s ended their marches and started to find multiracial and female representatives finally sitting at the table? When AIDS became the most urgent rallying cry, as the radical act of same-sex love found itself ending in death and, possibly worse, indifference?
When Winter briefly flirted with retirement, he recommended as his replacement Nelson -- who also knew the triangle offense. Winter decided to keep his job, but not after Nelson and Jackson got to know one another.
It opened on a late April morning to little fanfare.

Here in Ohio, our schools are inconsistent in providing substance-abuse prevention education. Too many of our children are ill-informed and unprotected. They, like many previous generations, have been left unprepared to make healthy decisions about alcohol consumption and other drug use.
And -- in a punchline -- Mullen said this behavior could warrant international sanctions. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta added that we'd "do everything we have to do to defend our forces." He did not spell out whether that meant going after the Haqqanis with U.S. special forces and/or drones, or cutting military aid. He did say "the first order of business right now is to put as much pressure on Pakistan as we can to deal with this issue from their side."

At a minimum, we need for this weekend's event to go off relatively smoothly and for all of the participants and spectators to stay safe. There's reason to believe that the event won't be marred by the kind of violence that Baltimore saw this Fourth of July, because tickets will be required for entry. Still, even a lesser incident would seriously diminish the degree to which the event serves as the promised three-hour commercial for Baltimore. We need to see downtown cleaned up and back to normal quickly, and we need to see the replacement trees event organizers promised.
"We could go into an extended cool period, which could really slow the systems down," said Linn Haramis, an entomologist with the Illinois Department of Public Health. "Now again if we had a hot summer, that would actually be much more important than a very early spring. Anything beyond 10 days, it's really guesswork on what's going to happen."

For the uninitiated, seeing how the Eameses lived may be a surprise. Their living room does not resemble the type of rigorously formal space that people today expect in a modern house from the era. Even though the Eames House is a wonderfully calibrated exercise in steel, glass and cement panel, the idea of replicating such formalism on the interior was anathema to its owners. If anything, their architecture is forced to take a back seat to their extraordinarily diverse collection of objects.
A 30-year-old federal law requires Ameren and other utilities to charge a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour for energy generated at nuclear plants to pay for long-term waste disposal. Ameren customers have paid $214.6 million into the fund, and the meter is still running.

Lopez's rebound rate (11.2 per 48 minutes) ranked 53rd in the league but that is largely because of his work on the offensive end. He nearly grabbed as many offensive boards (90) as defensive ones (119) this season but defensive rebounding is an absolute necessity for the Suns to improve next season.
Missouri state Rep. Dave Schatz, R-Sullivan, said he is confident he can get his bill, House Bill 658, passed this year to require prescriptions except for products from which less than 5 percent of the pseudoephedrine can be extracted.

"White Shadow" was discovered in a collection of unidentified American nitrate prints that had been safeguarded at the New Zealand archive since 1989. That's when Tony Osborne, the grandson of New Zealand projectionist and collector Jack Murtagh, brought the highly unstable nitrate material to the archive. Because the archive only has the funding to restore its country's vintage films, experts couldn't spend much time with the American releases (though "White Shadow" was a British film it was released in the U.S. in 1924 by Lewis J. Selznick Enterprises). Selznick's son, producer David O. Selznick, would bring Hitchcock to America 15 years later to make "Rebecca."

But instead of just repeating the premise, as happened often in Season 1, the sketch grew: Armisen and Brownstein searched for the "Battlestar Galactica" scribe Ronald D. Moore, which led them to an African American Portlander named Ronald D. Moore. ("Portlandia" is still a pretty non-diverse place, so seeing actors of color was welcome.) The non-"BSG" Mr. Moore gamely offered to write some new "BSG" episodes, and it built from there, until actual "BSG" stars Edward James Olmos and James Callis showed up. And it concluded with a final joke, with the assembled group sitting down to start a new DVD-watching obsession: "Doctor Who."

In order to make leftovers the star, it helps to have accompanists standing by. I keep some key ingredients in the kitchen that add flair to a dish, or help quickly forge a new one. Stock, for instance, can help bring moisture and flavor to already-cooked foods as you reheat them, even if they didn't contain stock in the first place, like leftover grains. Save rinds from hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, pecorinos or Gruyère, to throw into soups and stews  they add a silky, savory richness.

One of the highlights is a nugget, the largest one found in California. The Mojave Nugget, at 156 troy ounces (10.8 pounds), is in the permanent collection of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. It was found near Randsburg in San Bernadino County in 1977, which is pretty recent and leads one to believe that there still might be a bigger one out there. Somewhere.

Concept records that did not cohere. How about that My Chemical Romance album set in an apocalyptic wasteland? The one about the battle between superheroes and the forces of repression? Which is why they sang about... the same stuff they always sing about. Then there's Janelle Monae's Metropolis suite, which sounds great on paper, but has yet to translate to much actual sci-fi content in the songs. Clare Burson's set was supposed to be about the holocaust, or her grandmother, or European history; I listened to it ten times, trying and failing to tease the World War II narrative out of the songs. The Titus Andronicus album was advertised as a meditation on Civil War and New Jersey. Great!, but what about the Civil War and New Jersey? You can't just string together proper nouns; eventually, you either throw in a verb or you become Billy Joel in "We Didn't Start The Fire." These are all good albums -- I like them all, and I'm happy that I engaged with them. Ambition is great, and big talk is cool, and strong words in press releases do get the attention of gullible types like me. But at some point you've got to back up the blabbing with specifics; otherwise, you're just a tease, and will make me angry, and growly, and green, and poised to destroy Tokyo. Rock and roll and cola war, I can't take it anymore.

“I don’t feel any pressure this year because I know we have a lineup full of guys that are gonna hit,’’ he said. “We’ve underachieved this year as an offense, but it’s nice to have guys in the lineup you can depend on.

A satellite of a renowned braised pork foot specialty restaurant in Seoul, the ultra-obscure Koreatown spot is a nostalgic link to the steamy hole-in-the-wall jokbal joints of the motherland. Its name means Jokbal King of the Jangchung-Dong district. That enclave, as any Seoul denizen will tell you, is a paradise for jokbal buffs. There, dozens and dozens of chockablock shops boast names like Fat Grandma's Jokbal House or the Original Grandma's Jokbal (pronounced choke-bahl).

Trailing the Suns by two with just under six minutes left, the Blazers removed Marcus Camby and slid Nicolas Batum up the four spot, rendering Phoenix’s strategy of immediately double-teaming post-ups far more problematic. Batum promptly started raining jumpers, scoring eleven points in the final five minutes, as the Blazers used an 18-1 game-ending run to avenge last year's playoff defeat to the Suns.

"Reflections," a fireworks and fountain show, ends the night before the park closes at 10. There's seating available in Bayside Stadium, but I can't recommend sitting in the upper deck.

The technology now is limited to adults and can cost as much as $125,000, Brenner said. Children, like adults, also may want both conventional and new devices, depending on the task to be done, just the way a person may want an electric saw for one job and a manual one for something else, Brenner said.

Ron Campbell is an investigative reporter specializing in business, white-collar crime and charities. He recently exposed how a network of charities raised millions through telemarketing while spending almost nothing on good works.

It isn't "dependency" for the middle class to benefit from the programs that their tax dollars have financed. It is not un-American to question whether those earning many millions of dollars each year from investments should not have to pay taxes at a rate comparable to what average people see deducted from their more-meager weekly paychecks.
This was progress, and it makes you wonder why President Obama doesn't grab this opportunity, along with some of the others just lying around, and lead the way toward some sort of solution.

Luckily, bootleggers kept the vines alive in backwoods plots. The grape eventually began to make a comeback in its native Virginia thanks to Air Force pilot Dennis Horton, who grew up in Hermann and had played in the catacombs that once held casks of Stone Hill's wine. He began growing grapes in front of his house in Aroda, Va., and in 1988 asked Stone Hill to send him a shipment of Norton vines. The "Horton Norton" hit retailers' shelves in 1992.

øAnd, the opportunity to make a quick gain is usually based on an asset being undervalued. In fact, it is nearly impossible to know gold's real value.

But Google's share is likely to shrink if the Great Firewall blocks or slows traffic.
Huggett's sound in the concerto was perfectly calibrated to present her just out front of her colleagues, putting Tartini's melodies – quick and buoyant in the outer movements, gorgeously lyric in the central Largo – in the spotlight. Part of her appeal is that she obliterates the distinction commonly made between two ways of looking at the same activity, "playing the violin" and "fiddling." Her reading of the Tartini exemplified just that, with focused discipline and exquisite cantabile expressiveness as well as a sense of spontaneity and raw abandon.

After the massive success of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the relatively modest returns for the sequel "Prince Caspian" baffled many. But it really shouldn't have. Absent the sense of discovery and wonder that made the first "Narnia" film so magical, what's left is a well-made but fairly rote sword-and-sorcery-and-talking-animal movie, lightly draped in religious allegory. The DVD adds a few featurettes and a commentary track by director Andrew Adamson, while the double-disc DVD and Blu-ray editions also include deleted scenes and hours of behind-the-scenes material.

Hughes, Campbell and Epstein create evocative characters, especially effective in their "Wake Me Up When September Ends" trio - a song with a different meaning for each man. Hughes sings "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" with a voice of banked fire and shows off an idiosyncratic, hopping dance step that's looks like a cross between unbridled energy and neurological impairment. That's probably a fair description of desire.

In the end, perhaps Botta's SFMOMA is a kind of ancient echo: With its Palladian symmetry, its cross-shaped windows and Moorish overtures in a contemporary shell, it is a Babylonian ziggurat and not a modern building at all -- simply one for the ages.
A mandrake wails in a shop window, owls hoot and turn in the rafters outside the Owl Post Office, and even the ATM gives a nod to magic as a branch of Gringott's, the wizarding bank.

"I would welcome someone in town that has a vision of what the township really needs," said Councilman Qunizell McKenzie, who represents the East Ward, where most of Irvington's crime occurs.

They cautioned, however, that it's unlikely any additional extensions will be allowed until after a run-update in May. Also, they said, if fishing gets extraordinarily good in the next few days, they could order a closure again when they reconvene next Thursday.
Notes: The biggest difference between A-10 play and the whole season is the numbers of Mike McCall. SLU's six-game win streak coincided with him moving into the starting lineup, but beyond that, he's had hands down the best numbers in that time. He's +72 in that run, in which SLU as a team is +88. So most of the time SLU is building a lead, it's with McCall on the court.

Urban Prep is continuously breaking barriers and defying the odds. For example, the average student comes to Urban Prep with a 4th- or 5th-grade reading level. Upon graduation, these students not only graduate at or above a 12th-grade reading level, they are accepted to and attend college. Additionally, compared with the national average of 35 percent for black males, Urban Prep's graduates have an 83 percent retention rate entering their second year of college.

Hey, Hoynsie: I have been a huge baseball fan for a ton of years, but one thing I have never understood is why there are some positions that do not have any players who throw left-handed (i.e. catcher, third base, shortstop, and second base). Players who throw right-handed seem to have no limitations when it comes to position choice so why is the game not as generous to southpaws? -- Neal Sampson, Durham, N.C.

A bowl game remains, either the Fiesta, Sugar, Orange or Capital One, but once the seniors exited the turf at Ohio Stadium for the last time, the torch had been passed to a freshman class of which much is expected.

The Question: Back in August, I went to the Charter One bank in Euclid to cash out an 11-year-old U.S. Savings bond. When the teller told me the amount I'd get, I asked her to double-check because it seemed high. She did and stated that it was correct. I received $1,480.80. A few weeks ago, $690 disappeared from my bank account without warning. When I called to find out what the unknown debit was, Charter One said that they overpaid me for the savings bond, so they were taking the money back, and it wasn't my money so I should deal with it.

damage caused by tornadoes is more concentrated than damage from powerful hurricanes, such as Katrina, economists say. The tornado that devastated Joplin, Mo., on Sunday probably won't slow the overall state's economy very much, said Ben Kanigel, an associate economist at Moody's Analytics.

What is shocking is how Tebow remains one of the most discussed topics among the NFL elite gathering for their annual meetings many miles away in a wealthy Florida enclave. One general manager told me he spent 45 minutes talking Tebow with a fellow GM; both have solid quarterbacks and were never interested in him. Other executives told me they spent time at dinner Sunday night reviewing the merits and faults of the trade. The general consensus, these executives said, is that the Jets have made a terrible mistake."
"I'm struggling but there are lots of opportunities starting to come," she said.
øFor example, we sell a lot of houses. We sell a Barbie Dream House, but we don't sell real houses. We sell more cars than anyone, but they're toy cars. What we see is that the most important thing for the customer is to get the right toy. After that, we want to make sure they get a great deal, and so we're giving that to them with, huge sales, big deals all the time. We've had "our lowest price ever" quite frequently on products. We have sales that start on Sunday, Wednesday sales and weekend sales. The customer comes out for them. They are looking for the right product and looking for a good deal.

After Cho broke down the statistics of every player's class -- grabbing the attention of everyone in the room -- he passed along some team statistics that reinforced his central point. If the Blazers had shot 5 percent better from the free-throw line last season, they would have won five more games. If the Blazers' defense had forced opponents to miss one more field goal a half -- two more per game -- they would have allowed the lowest field-goal percentage of any team in the NBA.

The group called college athletics a financial “arms race.”
The president has said that he wants to put Americans back to work. He has said Americans are only 5 percent of the world's consumers. He wants the 95 percent of the world's consumers to buy American products so as to level the playing field. Well, the playing field on which the 95 percent of the world's consumers exist is poverty. So Americans will need to become dirt poor. The American worker will have to be paid almost nothing, as it is for the Chinese, Vietnamese, etc., workers in order for our products to be affordable for 95 percent of the world's consumers.

This one-room eatery on East Sixth Street may be the best place to eat raw fish in Cleveland. The menu is extensive, with six-piece rolls, special rolls, big rolls and hand rolls. All these can be stuffed with raw seafood that is so fresh you would swear Cleveland is perched on an ocean rather than a freshwater lake. Folks who can't bring themselves to swallow anything that hasn't been cooked can still order sushi -- stick with the tempuras, California rolls, and vegetarian selections. And diners who just want a taste of something Japanese can select noodles, soups and teriyaki.
But the AJC’s review of dozens of Blue Ribbon applications suggests many warrant more scrutiny. Some cite phenomenal growth in test scores or a new principal who turned a school around.

"If police and fire put up $100,000 for your campaign, you win," he said. Then you go in a room and negotiate with the people who put you in office, he said.

Staton: "Well it means a great deal to an agency, to a law enforcement agency and to our public safety entities. I think what it means more to is to the community. The community realizes that there are only so many resources out there and there's only so many resources available to the citizens in any given area. To know that if something major like this transpires, whether it be this or some catastrophe or whatever, that you have an agency that's developed the bonds with the other agencies to be able to pool and support them and help the alleviate the costs across the board. But the key thing is the resources. We have certain resources in Multnomah County that Marion County may not have. Marion County has resources I know we do not have access to. Tualatin Valley, for instance, is another. You've got search and rescue groups from across the country because we search in different types of areas, different types of terrain. Different types of equipment are used. And to be able to pool those in a time of need, is significant."

WILLRICH: SB 1070 appears to give the student the right to bring an action against the law-enforcement division and ASU for failure to adhere to SB 1070. However, the only remedy for the student under SB 1070 is the university being fined, otherwise there is no recovery for the student.
Miss Carmen always provides a knife and fork, but I prefer to attack fried chicken with fingers, because that is the way fried chicken is supposed to be eaten at Munch's, a home-cooking place that opened a few months shy of six decades ago.

This is SuperHeavy, whose self-titled debut comes out Tuesday on A&M/Interscope Records and features something for fans not only of Jagger's full-time band, but those with an appreciation for genre-mashing beats and rhythms. It's a project that Stone explained best one afternoon at Henson Studios in Hollywood, where the album was recorded during two different 10-day sessions in 2009.

You want to come?' 'Hell yeah.' 'Cool, I'll give you a call in a couple days.' And that was it."

Artest has since rehabbed his image. He earned the J. Walter Kennedy Citizienship award last year for his efforts raising money for mental health charities, including raffling off his 2010 NBA championship ring.

I wonder if Obama will be able to maintain the tolerant attitude he displayed Wednesday as the presidential campaign heats up. The president told ABC that he supports same-sex marriage laws that are "respectful of religious liberty" and allow churches and faith institutions to determine their sacraments for themselves. Those were reasonable, moderate points - which fly in the face of his administration's decision to force church-based institutions with deeply held religious objections to provide contraception as part of their employee health care plans.

When I felt comfortable enough, I let go of the wall and just stood there. Taking it all in, breathing in and out slowly so as not to lose my balance and topple over. Another two or three minutes passed and then, it dawned on me. I hadn't fallen yet. I stood up straight and puffed out my chest. I was on roller-blades. Realizing I had accomplished only the beginning, I knew what was next was movement.

Q: Please help me find a recipe for oatmeal cake. I had a neighbor some 40 years ago that shared a lot of recipes with me, and I made the oatmeal cake often. It was sort of a joke with my family because "first you cook the oatmeal" with a stick of butter or margarine, then add to the cake batter. After baking it goes under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the topping of coconut, milk or Milnot, brown sugar and pecans. It is a heavy cake, very moist and so delicious.
Local school officials would be required to ask parents how best to spend the money. Most of the money  70 percent  would be spread among all public schools, no matter whether they are in Davis, Beverly Hills or East Oakland.

A regionwide sewer system would also eliminate the need for 400-plus private wastewater treatment facilities discharging into the lake, Koster's report said.
I typed the names of the neighborhoods into my smart phone and emailed myself the reminder. The names really didn’t mean much to me.

I had never really explored the city.

Hey, Tony: Why all the panic? The Browns are a couple of breakdowns away from a 3-2 or possibly 4-1 record. That is not to say that I think the Browns have the talent to win consistently now, but any time you change a coach and subsequently your offensive/defensive systems it will take time for the front office to acquire the correct talent to run the systems and then it takes time for the players to learn and assimilate the information so they can run the systems well. Fans need to exercise some patience and trust that Holmgren and Heckert have the team's best interests in mind when they make decisions. -- Duane Showalter, Fox Lake, Wis.

Ask anyone from the Blazers' 54-win team of 2008-09, and they will undoubtedly say the one component that elevated that young, hungry group from an upstart into one of the Western Conference's best was its chemistry.

Voters rejected Senate Bill 5, a weapon Republicans aimed at public employee unions, because Ohioans saw the measure as one-sided. But unless something changes, Republicans -- in another one-sided move -- may force Ohio taxpayers to spend $15 million on two 2012 primaries. The reason: partisan GOP mulishness over boundaries for 16 Ohio congressional districts.
Despite a gubernatorial order to convene a joint special session, Democrats in the Senate called only a fraction of their members to Trenton, saying they had a written legal opinion they did not need to comply by bringing in the full upper house.

Like other survivors, Kaur, 37, and her family are still living with the trauma of that night as they try to move forward -- cataloging what was lost, thinking about whether to return and rebuild, and taking care of daily responsibilities like going to work. Recovering from this kind of stress will take time, a local trauma specialist told the Times; it's akin to the grief process after someone dies.

Julian Strickles went 1-for-3 with a run and an RBI for Cass Tech.
Another management challenge is avoiding isolation and finding ways to learn what employees are really doing and thinking. Many CEOs, Mr. Bryant writes, believe that it's a good idea to "get out and walk around." Deborah Dunsire of Millennium Pharmaceuticals routinely schedules walk-around time, during which she asks workers what is keeping them up at night and what they are feeling excited about. Bill Carter, a co-founder of Fuse, a marketing agency, confesses that he used to come back from his frequent out-of-town trips and retreat to his office. He soon discovered that "holing yourself up in your office is not the way to learn about what's happening in the organization."

People who ultimately land on any of the lists are those whom the government has a "reasonable suspicion" are associated with terrorism, Healy said.

They are called the Nets. This we knew. But if it's possible for a sports franchise to take a decades-old nickname, shrink it to fine print, and shove it in a drawer, that's what is happening here. The Nets is a sidecar, an auxiliary, an Oates to a Hall. Brooklyn is The Brand.

The board of commissioner’s unanimous vote for Foye came a day after he was named to the $300,000 executive director’s post by Cuomo. The governor had kept Ward in the job to oversee completion of the National September 11 Memorial Plaza in time for the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Foye, 54, an economic development official in the Cuomo administration and a Metropolitan Transportation Authority director, did not attend Thursday’s meeting.

Well, it seems they will and why not? Someone like Oquendo or Sandberg has been around enough and managed enough games at other levels that they know what they're doing and aren't going to make stupid mistakes. As Rangers GM Jon Daniels told me during the World Series, you can have inexperienced guys who know what they're doing, and experienced guys who don't. Now, would someone who's experienced and accomplished, like Terry Francona, be better than someone who's experienced and new? Maybe. There's always a safety for GMs to hire someone who has experience, because if you hire someone new and they bomb out, you look dumb. But the right new guy can be a great hire.

For kids, it may be easier to grasp the idea that underlies every kind of activism: Change Begins With Me. After all, for kids, everything begins with Me. They are less overwhelmed by the vastness of the world, more willing to see the direct line between their own light switch and, say, a polar bear habitat. Many adults treat such connections as if they were cute fairy tales — as if only a child could imagine that one little SUV had any bearing on world oil consumption! For such adults, "Reduce, recyle, reuse" might as well be "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe."
The day after Jon was born, a doctor told Jon’s parents that the first question for them was whether they intended to take Jon home from the hospital.

Arizona would be a nice fit for him. There's a warm climate, the option of a closed roof, and a wide receiver named Larry Fitzgerald.

That's Manning's goal, to win as much as possible and take another shot at a ring before his career winds down.

2. Would Jeff Samardzija have gotten a chance to start this season without the Cubs’ regime change? There’s no way to know but I sort of doubt it. As much as Jim Hendry loved him when he gave him $10 million to put down the football, his staff has pretty much concluded that Samardzija didn’t have the command or pitches to succeed. I can’t blame them, either. Samardzija had mostly started in the minors and had a 4.30 career ERA after almost 500 innings. That doesn’t scream big-time starter. But Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer decided to give Samardzija a chance to impress them, and he has. In fact, Epstein must wonder what would have happened if he had been in the Red Sox system late last season, when a lack of starting pitching depth triggered a 7-20 September. The win at Cincinnati on Wednesday night was impressive, as that can be a very tough lineup, in a very tough ballpark, for a right-handed starter. The only test left for Samardzija is how he holds up physically. He’s never thrown more than 141 2-3 innings in a season.

2007, Germany, in German, Turkish and English with English subtitles, 122 minutes. While I haven't seen all the films in this year's Frameline32, I'd still bet "The Edge of Heaven" is the best feature of the festival. Fatih Akin directs a film based on O. Henry-like interconnections between an old German man who asks a Turkish prostitute to live with him, his ever-tentative professor son and the prostitute's political-activist daughter, who falls in love with a German girl whose mother disapproves of the union. The film operates on several levels. While it looks at unexpected links between people, it also offers a metaphorical political message about how nations can join a common group and still maintain their individual cultures. The action is set against the candidacy of Turkey to join the European Union.
The next major bipartisan effort was the attempt by President Barack Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner to work out a grand bargain on raising the debt ceiling. It was reported at the time that the two sides were on the verge of agreeing to a two-stage strategy for raising the debt limit and cutting more than $4 trillion out of the federal budget through 2021. Reportedly, that plan would have included unprecedented cuts in spending, including at the Pentagon, and significant changes to Medicare and Social Security, the biggest drivers of future borrowing -- a major concession for Obama and other Democrats. But those negotiations collapsed and deteriorated into finger-pointing. Plenty of members of Congress made their feelings known about various reported deals, but there was never an actual vote on a long-term solution.

On the day I dropped by, Buddy seemed happy to have the company. It was just before his 37th birthday, and he had been a quadriplegic for 19½ years. In a football game during the fall of 1973 at William Tennent High School, where he had been a star quarterback who carried himself with the cocky attitude of his hero, Joe Namath, Buddy fractured his C-4 and C-5 vertebrae. It happened as he was running an option play; he had held onto the ball instead of handing off or passing. In a split second of horror in that game against powerful Plymouth-Whitemarsh, he was swept under in a pileup of tacklers, as if he were a surfer upended in a collapsing wave. It was a clean hit, yet devastating: Buddy would be paralyzed from the neck down.

Letter writer Kenneth Packard is angry. Apparently, he sped past a sign that said "WORK ZONE, 45 MPH" or something similar, was caught by a speed camera, and was assessed a fine of $40 ("Speed cameras: A shameless government money grab," Feb. 25). He feels he should be allowed to speed through a work zone without penalty. We all are constantly tempted to go faster than the speed limit.
I am one of millions of "real" persons who is suffering "real effects" of the idiotic plan – don't forget about us, the productive, hardworking masses.

That’s the whole point of “The Descendants,” which has Clooney facing a number of moral quandaries. Does he sell the ancient family estate to a developer, as his relatives are urging?

The essence of the First Amendment is the right of all to their own interpretation of religion, not just the right to their own convictions. To maintain that order of tolerance, the First Amendment mandates that the government must not establish religion, but rather allow the practices of all people. That is "the separation of church and state." The principle does not mean, as Rick Santorum mischaracterized it recently, that religious persons are banished from expressing their opinions in the public square. It does mean that government shall make no law that encroaches on the freedom of the exercise of religion by its citizens.

The Miami Heat beat the Knicks 104-94 to take a 2-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round series. Carmelo Anthony scored 30 points but had just nine second-half points. Moreover, it was a loss that took a toll: After the game, Amar'e Stoudemire lacerated his left hand by punching a fire extinguisher and its glass casing, according to a person familiar with the situation. Paramedics rushed into the locker room to treat Stoudemire, whose hand was covered in blood. According to the person, Stoudemire threw the punch on the short walk from the court to the Knicks locker room. Stoudemire left the arena at 10:36 p.m., wearing a sling on his left arm; he did not comment and quietly loaded the bus from a back entrance. Many Knicks used a back door to exit in an effort to avoid the media. Landry Fields, standing by a loading dock, called the locker-room atmosphere "tough" and said he did not see Stoudemire's injury. Stoudemire did not go to a hospital and will stay with the team. A Knicks spokesman declined to say if Stoudemire will be ruled out for future games.

One of the reasons I was drawn to hip-hop in the first place was because I thought it sounded pretty. College rock of the '80s had a big, soggy, distorted rhythm guitar soaking up its midrange. (Come to think of it, it still does.) The drums were tinny and compressed. Contemporary pop was lousy with thick slapped bass and sick-cow synthesizers. In hip-hop, there was wide-open sonic space. It was possible to hear the nuances of the rapper's voice, and the rattle of the snare, without interference from vibrating strings. Even when the emcee's delivery was abrasive -- KRS-ONE, for instance, or Parrish Smith -- it always seemed to pull me into a colorful, inhabitable soundscape. I was used to music that was crammed to the brim with overdubs and filler noises. Hip-hop was the opposite of that. There was room for me.

“The One That Got Away” is a bit more sober than Perry usually is. It’s a love letter to an idealized high school boyfriend whom Perry misses. The look backward extends the obsessions of the “Teenage Dream” album. We don’t learn much about the boyfriend or the relationship besides some common — and unromantic — details: They listened to Radiohead together, raided the adults’ liquor cabinet and got matching tattoos. He’s less of a person than he is a romanticized road not taken.

Idaho deputy district attorney Robert Green tried to challenge Wyatt's testimony, playing a Portland police training video called "Be a Witness or Intervene: This Decision Requires Careful Consideration."
