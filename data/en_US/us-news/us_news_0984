And who did most of the cooking when Jamie Bissonnette was growing up? "Mario's Pizza around the corner," says the chef-owner of Boston restaurants Coppa and Toro. Monday was pizza, Tuesday was "gross-me-out" night, he says, which often involved American chop suey with canned mushroom soup, and Wednesday was "fend-for-yourself." But now and then, Bissonnette's mom would make a big, beefy chili stuffed with beans, bell peppers and Budweiser.

Maher says the group was monitored by British intelligence agencies but never did anything illegal and thus was allowed to operate freely. He has come to criticize that enforcement strategy in his subsequent life as a scholar. In a 2009 paper, for example, he argued that by treating such organizations as buffers to more violent groups, the government has legitimized training grounds for radical thought. Too often, Maher says, he watched members of Hizb ut-Tahrir move on to more violent activities.
About 10,000 bills that should have gone out didn't or were delayed, BGE says. If you didn't get your bill BGE says to call (I know, I know) or email mybillingrep@bge.com. Another group of people who have issues are the 175,000 accounts who pay using BGE's Web site. They have to re-enter their checking account information and wait three business days for the bank to verify it, say BGE officials.
It's the most pivotal presidential race in human history (staying true to our apocalyptic tendencies), and we're debating which candidate cares most about dogs. I did my best in a previous column to illustrate the silliness of the Obama campaign's focus on a 30-year-old Romney/dog travel episode, but, alas, I misjudged our capacity for the absurd.

With a smirk on his face, longtime Twins fan Tom Harm of St. Paul walks away from what might have been considered a great offer from a scalper the past two seasons. With so many tickets on the street, he can make offers 60 percent below face value and get what he wants. It might take a few rejections, but the bad market eventually wins out when Harm and his three guests pay $30 a ticket to sit in the Dugout Box ($73 face value).
Because the county has no legal justification for holding someone who has posted bond, it stopped complying with ICE requests last year. Since then, hundreds of suspected illegal immigrants have posted bond and been released, and some have subsequently been picked up for additional crimes.

Ronaldo's contract with Corinthians was expected to end at the end of the year, but his condition kept deteriorating. He was visibly out of shape and fans jeered him after every missed play.
Calling up the customer-service department is not much of an improvement for riders. How many times have you called and all you got was a busy signal or you were placed on hold, only to be disconnected and instructed to call back again? Then, when you finally got the opportunity to speak to a customer-service operator, they had a lack of general knowledge about the SEPTA system or they got irritated with you because you asked them to repeat the directions they sputtered out or mumbled.

Another option is simply to not expand beyond a certain point. Schlafly was conceived as a local brew, said co-founder Dan Kopman, and it still draws 75 percent of its sales from metro St. Louis. It defines its market as "within 300 miles of St. Louis but not Chicago," and may be able to meet demand without much new capacity for some time.

Still, if Workman didn't think it completely through, that may be because the legislation wasn't completely his own. He said it was modeled after similar legislation that recently passed in Massachusetts, part of a growing alimony-reform movement.
Utah, Phoenix and Houston are all two games in the loss column behind Dallas and Denver, which has the tiebreakers over Phoenix. Passing either is far-fetched because it would require winning out and having Dallas lose all its games or making up three games over four games on Denver, including Saturday's Nuggets visit to Phoenix.

By the 1990s the house was in foreclosure and empty until a gay couple bought it and in 1994 converted it into Plainfield’s first B&B. Eleven years later, the two men sold the home to Lamont Blowe and Nancy Fiske. Fiske, 56, is white, grew up in Morris Plains and Basking Ridge. Her husband, Blowe, 55, was born in Virginia and moved often as a child, from the segregated schools of Prince Edward County, Va., to Iowa, where his father taught at a school run by Quakers. Later, the family lived in Kenya for five years. What Fiske and Blowe like so much about Plainfield today is its diversity.

* It’s impossible to evaluate Nick Markakis so far in 2012. He looked great in his first two games – two homers, four RBIs – and then had no homers and one RBI in his next 13 games before his three-RBI day Sunday. The guy is coming off major abdominal surgery and was sick most of the past week. The last player who has tried to come back so quickly from abdominal surgery – Washington’s Ryan Zimmerman in 2011 – didn’t hit his weight in his first month back last season. Eventually, Zimmerman returned to being Zimmerman. Markakis is going to be under more scrutiny, though, because his offensive production has been an issue the past two years.

That attention to detail can be found throughout the film — the pile of shoes left on the porches to keep sand out of houses; the ICU with its floor-to-ceiling glass walls the better to see crises in a glance; the traditional Hawaiian music, much of it from the late slack-key guitar legend Gabby Pahinui.

The ending of my new novel, "In One Person," is a refrain—the repetition of something Miss Frost, a small-town librarian, says to Billy, the bisexual narrator and protagonist. "My dear boy," Miss Frost says, "please don't put a label on me—don't make me a category before you get to know me!" Billy repeats Miss Frost's words.

— POLITICAL EXTREMES: The National Front in France. Golden Dawn in Greece. The Freedom Party of the Netherlands. The True Finns. Across Western Europe, and in parts of the East, the far-right is on the march. Europe has deep traditions of tolerance and pluralism with roots in the 18th century Enlightenment. But European history also offers the most extreme examples of racist nationalism. While outright Nazis are a tiny minority in Europe today, the economic crisis has fueled forces on the right opposed to immigrants and the very idea of European integration. On the other end of the spectrum, left-wing parties who see the European Union as a capitalist superstate suppressing the working classes have made gains in France, Spain, Greece and Denmark, among other countries.

A: I consider the "Soundcheck" program to more or less be the minor-league farm system for Live 105: bands like M83, Foster the People, Killers, Coldplay, Gorillaz, Silversun Pickups, Muse and Phoenix all developed on this weekly program, often as a demo or independent release, long before graduating to the big leagues. I still vividly remember the first time we spun "Such Great Heights" by Postal Service in December of 2002 and the phones absolutely blew up about the song.
Kelly, joined by linebackers coach Don Pellum, delivered. According to Armstead, Kelly came across as honest, charming and straight forward. But most of all, he didn't oversell. He didn't pressure.

While meeting with Reese, I told him why I thought a change of assignment was necessary. I pleaded to him that we "should fix the potential problem, before we have to fix the blame". I spent approximately 10 minutes explaining to Reese about the constant negative media barrage that had taken place over the weeks prior to our meeting, and I assured him the barrage would only increase as civil trial date got closer. I am not a psychologist, but as someone who was under similar pressure once, I assured him that the stress they were under would almost push almost any man to the brink. I even provided him with details of a specific incident, in which I thought Sergeant Nice grossly overacted on a routine call for service; which required me to step in to prevent the situation from escalating into a use of force scenario; one of which I wanted no part of.

øThe 18-member board of school presidents and chancellors is standing by the concept but is weighing modifications.

He was hurt a little bit last year so he didn't have as many numbers but he can rush the passer and he will help our football team. He really will. I think he will be great for our young defensive guys. With Frostee, I think it's the same thing. He played a lot of snaps for Cincinnati and we are going to use him inside as a pass rusher on third down, which he didn't do a whole lot there for whatever reason. They had other guys. We do think he is going to help us. We are excited about both those guys."

Hey, Charles: The Arizona situation is an interesting one to watch. But the Browns weren't as interested in Kolb last year as everyone thought.

Knowledge is power, but at the same time, knowledge can cause pain. I feel my job is to be there on both ends and stay the course with the family. There is a substantial emotional element to our work, and we have to know how to deliver bad news with dignity and kindness and without belaboring the difficult news. I can remember back 25 years to the first time I had to give bad news to a patient. My whole day was shot. But, I've since learned that I can't take it home. It doesn't mean I don't care, because I do, but I learned that I must separate my life from my patients'.

The drivetrain personality of each was distinct, particularly between the Eco and Sport extremes. In Eco mode, the CVT automatic transitions slowly to the engine's stronger revs, resulting in underwhelming takeoffs when the light turns green. (It does allegedly help gas mileage a bit, but Nissan had no estimates as to how much.) Sport mode hastens the transmission quite a bit; I found it punchy enough, though several editors still deemed it unresponsive — especially given the engine's penchant for brief turbo lag.

This view is already readily available 24/7 on Fox News to anyone with a TV and strong stomach; so why does the U-T waste valuable editorial space to give Hedgecock a forum he so richly does not deserve? Like so many right-wingers, Hedgecock is just another attack dog. Little insight flows from his poison pen.

Loopit is a pallid sequel, which tries to combine a similar theme - playing tiles that connect in a network of squiggly lines - with an annoyingly arbitrary scoring scheme out of Scrabble. The result isn't much fun; I mention it now only as an excuse to give Tayu one more fond plug.

Maryland's Republican voters, long marginalized in the selection of the president, may have contributed to the tipping point in the long and unpredictable GOP nominating process.

That was no surprise; the relatively affluent, urbanized electorate here has been a strong Romney constituency from the beginning. But the number of delegates Mr. Romney cleared from those contests and from what another win in Wisconsin should mark the beginning of the end of the 2012 primaries and foretell a shift toward the broader debate that will take place before November's general election.
