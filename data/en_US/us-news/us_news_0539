For way too long, we've had a financial system that was stacked against ordinary Americans. Banks on Wall Street played by different rules than businesses on Main Street.

So I guess you could say I became vegan for health reasons, but I've stayed vegan for the ethical and environmental reasons.

"Chomp" takes its name from the many critters that play supporting roles in this book, biting Badger with abandon in unseemly body parts. In previous episodes of his show on the Untamed Channel, Badger tripped over a tortoise and fell on a yucca. He broke both ankles when baby geckos "scurried up his shorts." So for the Everglades episode, Badger's producers have wisely reached out to Wahoo's dad, a well-known animal wrangler who keeps Alice the alligator, Beulah the python and dozens of other exotic critters as pets.

The start of the campaign season, however, also comes as Christie is dealing with fallout from the state’s botched Race to the Top application. Since last month, the governor has been in a continuous loop of bad news over losing out on $400 million in federal education funds because of a careless mistake on the application.

Generally speaking, Americans of all political stripes hate politics and politicians right now. Republicans are merely the focus of everyone's attention because that's where the action is.

Shurmur: "I think it's important because you have to have your running backs performing at a high level. To do that, they obviously have to get themselves trained and stay healthy. Of course, we've seen over short periods of time that those players you mentioned, Brandon and Montario, can play at a high level. I'm hopeful that they'll get themselves better, improve like the rest of the players and then be there."

And then, there was the hunt for the drinks. Roberts found no wine or drink list from the Titanic. So instead, he hunted down some wines and ports he believes the people on the ship may have enjoyed with their meal, and a couple of bottles of Armagnac from that era, one at a cost of $400 per ounce, or nearly $4,000 for the bottle.

Only if the Iranians want to start detailed discussions will Western negotiators lay out their demands.

"This is the room where, well, everybody died," Johnjay says. That's his grandmother's antique Mexican hutch, an aunt's hope chest, a great-great grandmother's rocking chair, which has graced generations of nurseries, another grandmother's set of vases and Flemish paintings inherited from his dad, an avid art collector who was born in Holland and immigrated to the U.S. in 1964.

Ah, sweet oblivion. You can't blame Bottom for wanting to forget the present, for wanting to lose himself in a dream, whether on a midsummer's night or otherwise. Still, he makes one more discovery late in the story that provides him with a way to forsake the drug and live in the present. It's a simple lesson that would easily fit on a slip of paper tucked into a fortune cookie (skip the madeleine): "You can't have life without pain. … Being alive means having the strength to face pain and loss."
So how to explain this? Why is a movie that puts mind-bending architecture so squarely at the center of its story so architecturally underwhelming? Why does its attempt to make metaphorical links between buildings and storyline fall so far below the standard set by classics from the 1970s — the documentary "Grey Gardens," say, or the paranoid thriller "The Parallax View" — or more recently by "Up in the Air," "(500) Days of Summer" and the TV shows "Mad Men" and "Rubicon"?

Eye problems can range from common refractive errors such as nearsightedness and farsightedness, to serious eye conditions, including amblyopia or "lazy eye" -- the most common cause of visual impairment in children. As the brain develops and receives diminished images from the affected eye, it begins to suppress those images and favor the unaffected eye. If this condition persists, the weaker eye may become useless.
The 21-year-old woman, who lives on Carpenter Street, was in the shower when around 4:20 p.m. she heard what she thought was a noise at her front door. When she went to investigate, she found Mark Meyer, 19, of Glassboro, sitting on her couch and rummaging through her property, said authorities.

Medicare has nonetheless partially blunted that line of ideological attack. Yet, just as the Democrats were rejoicing in the fruits of their cynicism, in came the latest economic numbers. They were awful. Housing price declines were the worst since the 1930s. Unemployment rising again. Underemployment disastrously high. And as for chronic unemployment, the average time for finding a new job is now 40 weeks, the highest ever recorded. These numbers gravely undermine Obama's story line that we're in a recovery, just a bit slow and bumpy.

Though it's only three games into the season, the Timbers are already showing an ominous pattern: starting slowly and going down a goal.

If you can handle it, take a look at his last book sometime, the one pithily entitled, “Bouncing Back — Overcoming Setbacks To Succeed in Business and in Life.” You might chuckle, but this stuff sells. Therein, you’ll find the usual fortune-cookie coach-speak, like “Pursue your goals with blissful determination” and “Prepare yourself for the impulse that drives your revitalization forward” — all of it basically a three-century old rewrite of Immanuel Kant (“Duty! Sublime and mighty name … ”) that all the self-help gurus steal from.

"There is no question that in the U.S., vegans and vegetarians are thinner and tend to be healthier than people eating the standard American diet," says Brill. However, research supports fish as a heart-healthy, low saturated fat choice, she adds. Scientists compared the health of the arteries of middle-aged Japanese men with middle-aged white American and Japanese-American men living in the U.S. The Japanese, who have a very high fish intake, had low levels of atherosclerosis and twice the amount of omega-3 fats in their blood. "The fact that the Japanese had almost no evidence of disease, yet the Japanese-Americans had high rates indicates that genetics is not a protective factor in disease risk. The researchers concluded that eating fish year in and year out protects against atherosclerosis," Brill says.

The economy was in horrible shape. We had widespread gas shortages. 52 Americans were being held hostage in Iran and the Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan. Thirty-two years ago, many of us still had unsettling memories of Cold War saber-rattling and bomb shelters and Nikita Khrushchev saying, "We will bury you!" Americans were tired of being taunted.

There's one thing you can do immediately, and that is to urge your son to supplement the (I assume) couple's counseling with his-and-hers individual counseling -- and if you can, offer to pay for it. Solo therapy is in his best interests regardless, whether she turns out to be an emotional abuser, he does, or both. That's because emotional abusers don't just hit pause on their abuse when they enter a therapist's office; they are known to manipulate the proceedings to their advantage.

France's Socialist presidential candidate, Francois Hollande — who is leading incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the polls — has said he would renegotiate the eurozone's austerity-focused fiscal pact to include measures that would encourage growth.

"Quarry or reseed me," writes Edward Hoagland, whom the writer John Updike called "our finest living essayist" and the Washington Post lauded as "the Thoreau of our time," "but if life is, as Emerson suggested, a seethe of ecstasy, then time in its continuum has been the seat of joy and my citizenship lies more in the humus than the strata underfoot."

Yes, military health-care and benefit costs are a runaway train — the fastest-growing part of the entire defense budget. As former Defense Secretary Robert Gates pointed out before he left office last year, something has to change before these lines become the single largest item in military spending. It’s also true that the massive defense-budget cuts now planned make reform even more imperative.

Washington returns to Nairobi every year, sometimes paying for doctors and nurses to go with him and provide medical help, but the operation is now mostly self-sustained thanks to his fundraising efforts and tireless work.

The nearly 2,000-year-old ruins of Palmyra, an ancient oasis city that was one of the biggest tourist draws with towering Roman colonnades and a temple to the god Baal, stand deserted.

An old French door becomes a full-length mirror; a rescued metal mailbox a side table in the living room.
And the idea that smokers are the ones being discriminated against is ludicrous. Both the smoker and non-smoker start out on an expected even plane before they enter a business for service, that is, a means to pay for the service or product rendered. That does not empower either smoker or non-smoker to bring in or do something they like to do while enjoying the service provided, especially if it infringes on other patrons.

8:14 p.m.: Okay, here's my take. I wasn't thrilled about all the lip-synching, but visually, this was probably the most impressive Super Bowl halftime performance ever, and Madonna just emanated star power. She said she was nervous beforehand, but she looked comfortable onstage, and like she was enjoying herself. That she belonged there. In comparison, the Black Eyed Peas last year looked like awkward amateurs. The gospel "Like a Prayer" was a great choice to close -- an effective heart-to-heart moment after all the glitz.
Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, is expected to issue an advisory in the coming days directing boards of election on the timeframe for in-person early voting at board headquarters.
The budget office had previously reported the rising deficits under Obama's proposal, compared with current law that would allow George W. Bush-era tax breaks to expire and impose steep federal spending cuts, including reductions in defense spending that many in Congress hope to reverse.

How many contractors receive work without competitive bidding? This one's the ringer, and perhaps most important. Services should always be shopped around for the taxpayer's best deal. Bidding helps to inoculate against favoritism and the kind of rigged deals that warp trust in government.

The details: Rye whiskey, made from a preponderance of rye grain versus barley or corn, has rebounded from obscurity in recent years. But it still usually requires a gateway to convert a bourbon or scotch drinker to the spicy side. Which is where Bulleit Rye ($22) comes in. From the popular bourbon label owned by Diageo, this may not be the most complex rye, but at 95 percent rye mash and 90 proof, it's a savory and legit entry to the field - and one that will appeal to Bulleit bourbon's many fans. For this price, it's just the thing to bring to a party and quietly evangelize rye's virtues.

Editors pledge to change that.

"Little Broken Hearts" little resembles Jones' previous four solo albums, from the vampy cover photo to its lyrical content and vaguely psychedelic sound. It's edgy, effects-laden and deeply personal. She's written a few songs she felt were this personal before, especially on her 2009 album "The Fall." But much of "Little Broken Hearts" centers on her life and the emotions you run through during relationship problems — from betrayal and indecision to healing and moving on.

Although Borys says he and his colleagues felt it would be a good idea to place the emphasis on Beethoven for its Candlelight debut, the group's activities in Canada and on the road extend well beyond that great 19th-century German composer.

So I'm voting "no" and I hope everyone else does too.

In Port Stanley, another Lake Erie fishing village, Larry Jackson's response to the Asian carp threat was a fatalistic shrug. At 73, he's seen lots of ups and downs in a lifetime of fishing. He was co-owner of the Wheatley processing plant that recently went bankrupt. A big financial hit, but he still has his lakefront fish shop and two tugs.
Howard McGillin, who has performed the title role in “The Phantom of the Opera” more than 2,500 times, has been asked the same question many times. Is the Phantom, at heart, a good guy or a bad guy? There is, after all, ample reason to make each claim.

Jos Viramontes is excellent as George. A very meaty role for an actor, because he must show both his irritation at Lennie and his love for the big, dumb lug. And he is the one who must take epic action at the end of the play. His desperation and misery for what he must do plays across his entire body like light shining in the darkness.

During the public ceremony Flory called on members of the cadet corps to step forward and talk about their piece of the flag, starting with the first red stripe.

We'd do this all the time if we could, of course. The problem is that everyone has day jobs. And while you might think that these people would be the kind of folks who embalm corpses for a living or perform their duties at Hot Dog On A Stick with a little too much enthusiasm, the truth is much more interesting. One woman works at a local sperm bank. Two women work at local sex clinics; one a professional phlebotomist for HIV testing, the other gives results to HIV test recipients -- her job is to tell people if they are HIV positive or not. One of the guys has worked in HIV mental health for the city and county of San Francisco for many years. And me? I just write about sex, so I work the "cute and unemployed" angle as hard as a girl can, while listening appreciatively to sperm bank chat and debating our favorite presenters on adult baby lectures. Oh, and I can patch inflatable canines in five minutes flat.

Back at home, the Daily Caller reports that the Secret Service is busy guarding Newt Gingrich, at a likely cost to the taxpayer of "tens of thousands of dollars a day."

I had no immediate desire to open another restaurant after Park Kitchen. And I never had any desire to be a restaurateur. But after 2008, I had a glut of really great staff that I didn't want to lose and I also became aware of this building (at the corner of Northwest 17th and Marshall). After some time, everything coalesced, and that's the story. Also, it's more a beverage-oriented place than a restaurant -- a tavern. That's what I came up with after brainstorming with Will Preisch, who will be the chef at The Bent Brick.
This silliness, presided over by director Michael Larsen, gets a full-court press of hamming it up from the touring cast.

HIGH POINTS: I usually limit travel gear to the bare minimum, but I took this along to give it a fair shot on the road. Wow, am I glad I tried it. I used it with a SanDisk MP3 player beside a private neighborhood pool. I had to turn it down for fear of disturbing the neighbors. This is, hands down, the best speaker of the iPod type that I have ever heard, with rich tones. The bass is amazing for its size; it's like a boombox, only it's a mere 3.8 by 2.4 by 5.7 inches. That's more than I would typically take traveling, but if you really want to listen to your personal soundtrack without earphones, this is worth packing.
The policies protect both sides, Price said. Sponsors can fall prey to scams in third-world countries, and children can become unsuspecting targets of pedophiles. Donors who want to know more about the boy or girl they sponsor have to do it the old-fashioned way — by becoming pen pals.

Last year I made myself throw it, even in uncomfortable situations. I started to get a feel for it.

White House officials said Obama had long planned to spend the anniversary with U.S. troops and his trip also seemed intended as personal assurance to Karzai that the United States won't abandon Afghanistan after most U.S. forces are gone.

Is her mission, though, to explain or merely present? Sometimes it is hard for the reader to tell. Catchphrases, slogans, names fly by with bewildering rapidity. Page after page is packed with them, like flies on flypaper. Gordimer is so much a part of her society, so avid an observer and participant that they are meat and drink to her. But what about the reader? Even the most seasoned students of South African culture might find themselves at sea, so what about the less informed? At times, they are bound to feel like guests at a party struggling to follow the myriad references in multiple conversations swirling around them — and sometimes over their heads.

Director James McTeigue ("V for Vendetta") keeps the movie in motion, and as long as it's in motion, with Cusack scrambling, delivering zingers and showing panic at what his fervid imagination has created, it works. Dread and foreboding hang over the film, which has the look of a graphic novel adaptation. There are dead spots in the narrative and dead weights in the cast (villain and cop are lacking), and the climax is anticlimactic.

"We have someone who's certainly the choice of the establishment Republicans, someone who's turn it was," Santorum told a crowd of about 300. "We see that so often in Republican politics for president. It's almost inevitable whoever's the next in line, that's who the Republicans tend to put forward.

The Blue Ribbon Commission on Transportation Funding has recently announced its recommendations to significantly increase the gas tax and to double vehicle registration and inspection fees, taking over $900 million per year out of Marylanders' pockets. While some jobs may well be created, there is no doubt that some will also be lost due to the significant impact on the cost of moving goods and food, traveling to work and transporting children to school and activities. In this current economy with extremely high gas prices already, families don't have unlimited funds, so increasing their costs in one area will require cuts in another area of family spending. The net result will create more of a financial burden for families and small businesses in the midst of economic hard times.

Likes: Convenient, effective and unobtrusive. The two lights — a bright (75 lumen) white beam and flashing red light — are powered by the same lithium polymer battery, which lasts five hours on full power and recharges in five hours in a small USB recharging dock (included). The front light dims when you hold a button and strobes when pressed twice. At 3.5 ounces, it's small enough that you don't feel it, and it doesn't bob on your head as you run. Rainproof and waterproof for 30 minutes when submerged to 1 meter (3.3 feet). Also great for nocturnal cycling or other activities.
For the two Silicon Valley guys who met at Stanford, the return is like sliding into a comfortable pair of Birkenstocks. They've spent the requisite long hours in a Peninsula garage working on early prototypes. They've racked their brains to come up with all the right pieces and processes to build a wining product. They've had that uneasy, yet exhilarating, feeling of hurtling headlong into the unknown.
The cantina's menu seems ideal for sharing — a stylish margarita, some snacks over loud music and snatched conversation.

• Stoudemire wasn't the problem, Zwerling explained. Rather, it was the Knicks' stagnant offense: "Tonight, they reverted back to how they played in Game 1, focusing way too much on Anthony on one side of the court. In the end, hero ball wasn't enough, especially because the Heat zeroed on him marvelously. LeBron James aggressively threw his 6-8, 265-pound frame at him, cutting off his usual direct linear movement to the basket and forcing him to take a few extra dribbles to at least find space. In addition to Shane Battier's backup support on Anthony, the Heat ran everything at him, while always making sure to keep an eye on and quickly rotate back to cover 3-point shooters Smith and Steve Novak."

In "To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918," Adam Hochschild challenges this image of the European home front. In this beautifully written and compellingly narrated story of Britain at war, Hochschild forces us to think about the Great War from the dual perspectives of those who prosecuted it and those who decried it. His primary focus is on well-known "divided families," such as that of John French, hero of the Boer War, first commander in chief of the British Expeditionary Forces and last viceroy of Ireland, and his sister Charlotte Despard, militant suffragette, Labour Party activist, antiwar activist and, later, Sinn Fein member. As French ordered British soldiers through enemy fire and poison gas at the battles of Ypres and Loos, Despard sat in Holloway Prison on reduced rations and under the British prison code of silence. Despite each hating the cause represented by the other, French and Despard remained close until French became viceroy of Ireland and imprisoned his sister's comrades-in-arms in 1918.
Yormark: “Well, we had a 10 percent increase last year in tickets sold. Had we stayed at Izod, nobody knows how many would have renewed, so any uptick – given the team’s performance and the fact that this was a lame-duck franchise – was a positive.

We have to do that within the first 30 days. I want to see the data summaries on multiple points. I want to see where the gaps are. ... If we're talking about the SAT, that's something you just can't fix in the course of a year, because it's not curriculum-based, it's more or less something that we have to prepare students for over the course of their academic career. If we're seeing an achievement gap based on the proficiency exams, the MSA, the HSA, that's a content-driven test, those are more immediate solutions because it's the content they're being assessed on, versus their aptitude.
personal thing, but the concept of this new scent from actress Kate Walsh was so intriguing that I couldn't wait to smell it, and I've been wear-testing it for a few weeks. It's called Boyfriend because it was inspired by the scent her boyfriend left on her skin. Makes you go, hmmm, right? Anyway, the warm woody scent has a fragrant floral bouquet of night-blooming jasmine, and my friends have been giving it an enthusiastic thumbs up. The dreamy scent is an intoxicating mix of masculine and feminine that evokes a sexy, sultry aura. I love the purse-sized Pulse Point Oil, but it's also available as a perfume ($35-$65).
