Irvin was the centerpiece of a draft that was decidedly defensive minded as Seattle spent eight of its 10 picks on defensive players - although one of those is being moved to offense. But none of the additions Seattle made to its defense has the backstory that matches its first-round pick.
Leading the way was Ducks point guard Nia Jackson, a junior from Seattle who was named one of 15 players on the All-Pac-10 first team. Jackson, who has not played in a game since Feb. 3 after a knee injury at Washington, averaged 17 points and 5.7 assists per game in the 21 contests she appeared in. Oregon coach Paul Westhead confirmed on Tuesday's Pac-10 conference call that Jackson will not play in Oregon's first-round game against Arizona on Wednesday.

Snorkeling, however, is free once you have the gear, and you can do it as long as you want and wherever you want. Our excursion cost $95 a person, the wet suit is $10more. Photos, which we didn't buy, plus a few trinkets, can be had as part of an all-of-the-above package for $149. With orientation, waddling to the beach, kicking around, diving, rolling back onto shore with all the grace of a penguin on land — me, not Yorkie and Terri — and talking about what we'd seen, we burn up about 90 minutes. Time and dollars well spent? Yes, for scuba neos like us. And the little Cousteaus will love it.

Job well done.
The main problem with this is that these aren't qualities people need to learn from religion; they are things religion learned from people. By providing an outlet for these universal human needs, as well as a reassuring lens through which to view a dangerous and incomprehensible universe, religion filled a vital role in civilization's development. Of course, it also led to prejudice, oppression and bloodshed that persist to this day. De Botton, however, isn't interested in exploring the hypocrisy between what the holy books say and how their followers behave -- he takes them at their word.
He has formed a committee, which includes council President C. Ellen Connally, to raise money for the campaign. The committee will probably likely poll voters this year and launch a public campaign early next year.
Carb consumption: Americans, on average, eat 250 to 300 grams of carbs a day, accounting for about 55 percent of their caloric intake. The most conservative recommendations today say they should eat half that amount. Some recommend far fewer.

What if our enslaved ancestors, or those afflicted by Jim Crow and lynching - accosted by the brutality, bricks and spittle of bigotry - had succumbed to excuse-making and complaining in the face of vast social mountains to climb, rather than by faith, steadfastness and moral rightness being resolved to collectively make the journey with their dignity, pride and souls intact?
Many thought we'd many songs from "The Promise," the CD included with the "Darkness on the Edge of Town" 30th anniversary set, but only "Because the Night," "Talk To Me," "The Promise" and "Rendezvous" have been played from the 19 songs on that album.

There are questions about his situation, too.
"To even suggest that one’s occupation, or where he or she earns a living, should impede who can serve smacks of elitism," Oliver said in a written statement. "That is why the framers of the New Jersey State constitution made provision to establish a part-time Legislature — so that citizens could elect people to represent them who hail from all walks of life. Not just those who are independently wealthy, hail from corporate America or are self-employed, but also teachers, police, firefighters, health care practicioners, social workers, labor representatives."

Huge Tree Pastry is the reincarnation of an old Monterey Park breakfast favorite, Yi Mei Chinese Pastries, which was hit by a fire about two years ago. The old location was a cramped little stall with too few tables and too many customers. The new incarnation is far bigger and far cozier, and it fits the food better. There's enough space to chill out and really sink down into your pile of starch.
I'd call Howard's bluff. The Magic are winning. They also, per the collective-bargaining rules, can offer him an extra year and higher annual raises in a long-term contract.

A total of 65 underclassmen, the most ever, applied for the draft. Not all of them will get picked, but some will earn big bucks.

"That's right. Yea," Dineen said. "He finished practice off (Monday) and, like I say, he took the morning off. We have different players taking them off. We try to lean towards the side of precaution if there is something somebody is a little tender with. Part of that precaution is we felt we needed an extra backup."
Wallace added 15 points and eight rebounds for the Blazers. Przybilla, who started the second half in place of Camby, pulled down nine rebounds and took a couple of charges.
Up and down the North Shore on Wednesday, afternoon had folded beautifully into evening. Rainstorms had swept through Duluth the night before, stirring up the lake bottom just off the beach. But the portion of Lake Superior that Adams and a few others seined near the Aerial Lift Bridge had settled down, and the first sweep with a 25-foot net yielded a few handfuls of smelt, a promising sign.
My mother, the late Beatrice Mary Grace O'Donnell (Klinkenberg), alas, was a Chicago refugee. She was also a stereotypical Irish cook, good at boiled potatoes, boiled cabbage and corned beef, and almost nothing else. Frying a glorious chicken was not among her culinary skills.

Lowdown: OSU coach Mike Riley says one player can't replace one of the school's most prolific offensive stars. McCants (just 14 carries in 2010) is the most experienced returning ballcarrier, however, and he has been looking to "break out" since he stepped on campus in 2007 only to be later overshadowed by Rodgers. If McCants -- who has improved as a pass-catcher -- can at least be a dependable first and second down back he's probably done his job. Riley has talked about "tailback by committee" and Riley is not discounting confident true freshmen Malcolm Agnew and Storm Woods barging into the rotation. McCants did show breakout signs in 2008, when he rushed for 337 yards, but his progress was slowed by a knee injury in 2009.
The salami was encrusted with pepper that turned out to be positive for Salmonella Montevideo, the same strain involved in all of the other cases. The investigation later implicated red pepper as well.

He scored more points in the first quarter (16) than he had in the first two games combined (15).

You know, U.S. Treasury bonds. Those are bonds issued by the same government that's allegedly about to default.
Every day is different, absolutely fascinating and a learning experience. In Canada, I'm trying to get legislation passed to save the polar bear. I'm going to Madagascar to try to save the lemur. Yesterday I was on stage with Amnesty International; today I'm doing a bit of business with Virgin Atlantic.
The result was something closer to tempura or beer-battered onion rings in consistency — flavor-packed nuggets of chickpea flavor. The idea of using the bean liquid makes sense — half of the flavor in the bean goes into the liquid, and the starch in the bean thickens the liquid nicely. I used to work with an experimentally minded chef who made a vinaigrette with black bean liquid and balsamic vinegar — it was delicious.
Comment: Arguably biggest skill set of any linebacker in draft. Fast and agile, with seamless acceleration. Plus cover skills. Stumbled at starting line of 40 and still ran well.

Two days after leaving their house, Kaine Horman filed for divorce and a restraining order against his wife, prohibiting her from any parenting time with their daughter.
Obama's election, after all, marked the leading edge of a generational transition. Unlike his predecessors, Obama is too young to have been forged by one of the last century's great conflicts (either World War, Korea or Vietnam) or by one of its great liberal expansions of government (the New Deal or the Great Society). The president represents an America where racial and regional distinctions are often harder to discern than they used to be. In his penchant for sarcasm, he personifies the post-"Simpsons" America, where edge displaces earnestness.
Gas heating bills in the Midwest should be about $803, the agency projected in its November Short Term Energy Outlook. That's $2 less than last winter and $43 less than what the EIA experts estimated in October.

If customers discover the lower price within 30 days, Fry's offers a 110 percent refund on the difference.

Shearing wrote "Lullaby of Birdland" in 1952; it's named for the famous New York jazz club. He acknowledged composing it in just 10 minutes. "But I always tell people, it took me 10 minutes and 35 years in the business," he told The Christian Science Monitor in 1980. "Just in case anybody thinks there are any totally free rides left, there are none!"
The taping, originally scheduled to begin at 5 p.m., didn’t start until after 9 due to various technical delays.

As Giovanni, a predatory Taras Domitro stalks in and out of the spotlight, admirably chewing the cold, industrial scenery devised by designer Alexander V. Nichols. Jeremy Rucker, Quinn Wharton and Luke Willis make convincing living simulacra of the shades that hover pensively atop Rodin's sculpture of the "Gates of Hell," and the five court ladies, garbed in Sandra Woodall's eye-catching proto-Renaissance costumes, sneer superciliously with enthusiasm. Yet, if there is a weakness in this version of "Francesca," it is that ultimately dramatic coherency is lacking. Despite striking imagery, it comes off as neither a plainly told history of Francesca and Paolo, nor, as Dante presents it, a passing glimpse into the lives of two souls in hell.

Rodriguez received what's called platelet-rich plasma injections, or PRPs. Doctors will take a small amount of a patient's blood, centrifuge it to yield a concentration of platelets and inject it back into injured tissue. The idea is to supplement the growth factors and plasma cells in a person's blood with a concentrated dose in order to speed up healing of, say, a sore knee or a scarred Achilles' tendon.

Despite the many welcome changes, one of my favorite elements has existed since the start: the outdoor, "drive-in" movies.

This brief tour of American history, which could be extended to include Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, reveals that modern-day conservatives have "the spirit of '76" on their side, as well as the power of Jefferson's original formulation of the American creed. Liberals, on the other hand, have the arc of American history on their side, which until the presidency of Ronald Reagan seemed to have the final word in the debate. After all, who could imagine a successful political movement requiring the revocation of two centuries of American history? Barry Goldwater, who campaigned for president in 1964 on just such a radical agenda, received only 38 percent of the vote.

So if you can get the kid that might be that role player or the guy that is just trying to get on the field and he’s competing hard every day, that’s going to push everybody else.

What's happening? One theory is hyperactive neurotransmitters, like dopamine, that help shuttle information into both short-term and long-term memory centers, change lanes. The visual information you are seeing for the first time ends up getting sent directly into long-term memory, before it is processed into short-term memory. The result: Your brain "recalls" the image of the Mayan temple from the long-term memory storage area and that tells you it's information from the past, not the present. Deja vu!

A Yes, I thought the same thing exactly. Plus, it's part of the spirit of that night's show. "Yes, Yes, Yes" is one of the three songs of mine that are most influenced by, most indebted to, Thelonious Monk. The others are "Ramona" and "My Life With You," off the last album. You know, I recently played a whole show of Monk's music at an art center up in Vermont. With the whole band, and saxophonist Jim Hoke. We faced it and we got through it -- it actually went really well.

Which brings us to Napa's versions. Napa is not a place for cheap wine, and that includes Merlot.

2005 Pieropan Soave Classico Calvarino ($33) Remember Soave? Probably not - this white wine from Italy's Veneto became almost synonymous with forgettable, mass-produced bottlings. But it's an honest compliment to say that Leonildo Pieropan arguably makes the best Soave around. Pieropan shows what Soave can be - flavor-packed wines with both freshness and power. This limited single-vineyard effort, from 70 percent Garganega and 30 percent Trebbiano, wraps scents of freesia and honeysuckle around a dense mineral core. Racy lime and citrus offset a rich texture on the palate, all achieved without a dose of oak. The 2004 also may still be on shelves, as is Pieropan's affordable basic Soave bottling.

The Jose Theater, with an estimated $2 million market value, is linked to a federal housing deal, while eight other pieces -- including sidewalks, paths, landscaping or slices of park land -- have been determined to have little or no market value and likely will be transferred to the city, which pays for their maintenance. Meanwhile, 17 others are encumbered by liens from either JP Morgan or Santa Clara County, including the Billy DeFrank Center, the Bay Area's only lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community center south of San Francisco. Its lease agreement with the redevelopment agency -- at $1 a year -- started in 1999 and runs to 2054, making it an unlikely investment for prospective buyers, Keit said.

3. Metta World Peace's good defense canceled out his bad offense. OK, so it was cute to see his two three-pointers cut the Thunder lead to 96-87 with 2:25 left. But World Peace hardly should've been featured as much offensively where he went three-of-13 from the field. It's a shame because World Peace mostly played solid defense on Durant, who had to work hard for his 21 points on 10-of-21 shooting. World Peace made him pick up his dribble, fronted him in the post and aggressively fought through screens. It was all for naught because of World Peace's bad shooting.

When Titus confers with his rather somber brother Marcus, however, their conversation is impaired by Michael Galizia's uneven performance as Marcus. Although Galizia looks right for this grizzled role, he needs to articulate his words more clearly in some scenes.

I know there is a lot of skepticism about the importance of the budget deficit in this area. However, my empirical work with Hiro Ito indicates that there is a solid link between budget deficits and the current account deficit. Simply stated, we found a one-percentage-point decrease in the budget deficit results in between 0.2 percentage points to a half percentage point decrease in the current account deficit. For the unconvinced, note that between 2000 and 2005, one saw a roughly 4.3 percentage point of GDP swing in the federal budget balance. Let's take a high estimate of how that would affect the current account deficit by using the coefficient of 0.5. This implies a 2.2-percentage-point decline in the current account. Guess what the actual decline in the current account was between 2000 to 2005 … 2.2 percentage points. So In other words, I don't agree with Bernanke's saving glut hypothesis that asserts that the largest source of our current account deficit is located in East Asia. Overspending on our side plays a significant role as well.
