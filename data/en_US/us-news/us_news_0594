Recently on "Meet the Press" Muslims heard few words which were heartwarming. Republican Rep. Raul Labrador said "it wouldn't matter" if President Obama were a Muslim. I presume most of the citizens do not realize how much American Muslims agree with these words. The first time I saw Senator Obama was at the Democratic convention in 2004; I still remember the words "they would give me an African name, Barack, or "blessed," believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success."

I do not remember anyone in the news media speculating about Senator Obama's faith at that time. Most of the people did not even think that in few years he will be our first African American President.

SB 5 eliminates binding arbitration when workers and management cannot reach an agreement on a contract. The bill requires the government's legislative body, such as a city council, to be the final decision maker. If the body cannot decide, management's offer takes effect.

For me, that friend is one person: Susan. Among the many interests Susan and I share is a passion for home design.

The choruses Saturday in Gamble Auditorium were arrayed on either side of the organ, heightening the antiphonal effects Bach built into the score.

As the governor took the stage, a handful of UAW members booed him.

Barrett points to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that Wisconsin is the only state to have lost a statistically significant number of jobs over the last 12 months.
From the outside, it might look as though Third Rail has led an entirely charmed life so far. But fledgling arts groups are never high on the economic food chain, and theater is a difficult endeavor, on stage and off. In fact, O'Connell recalls a trying time when the group might have blown apart while it was barely off the ground, during the production of 2005's "Dirty Story." They felt the pressure of initial success, the play itself was daunting, personal tensions were high.

Brandt used to say he preferred a quarterback entering the NFL to have 30 college starts. But he says the game has changed. Even at the high school level, teams are throwing the ball all over the field. So quarterbacks learn to throw the ball and read defenses at an early age. Because of that, those who reach the NFL level are often ready to play earlier.

It hasn't been as easy as expected, however. Several other high-caliber conservatives are challenging him in the primary, including former Marion County Coroner John McGoff and former U.S. Attorney Susan Brooks. In recent weeks, McIntosh has come under heavy fire over residency issues. Many Hoosiers, it seems, aren't sure they want to send to Congress a man who moved back to Indiana from the D.C. area with the sole goal of being sent right back to D.C. The fact that he possessed a Virginia driver's license hasn't helped his cause.

Rather than looking backward for someone to blame, McCain and Obama should be focusing on the problem in front of us. Financial institutions are buckling under the weight of hundreds of billions of dollars in investments that have lost their market value. The main question for politicians isn't whether to act -- the comments Friday by congressional leaders and top administration officials made it clear that Washington will undertake something extraordinary -- but what to extract from the companies that are helped and how to prevent the problems from recurring.
The elected offices of auditor, clerk of courts, coroner, engineer, recorder, sheriff and treasurer will be replaced by more streamlined appointed positions. The prosecutor will remain.

The Browns got an elite prospect in Alabama running back Trent Richardson with the third pick in the draft and made the bold selection of 28-year-old Oklahoma State quarterback Brandon Weeden later in the first round. With their 11 picks, they added two offensive linemen, two defensive tackles and two linebackers, but used just one draft pick (fourth-rounder Travis Benjamin) to try to improve one of the NFL’s worst receiving corps. Still, there is bound to be some quality in the quantity of picks the Browns made.

Limbaugh has been criticized during his career -- facing charges of tastelessness, racism, insensitivity and downright meanness -- but he is facing his biggest test now. Harsh criticism as well as the defection of many of his show's sponsors -- including Sacramento's Sleep Train, an early supporter -- followed his his verbal attacks on Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke after her testimony before Congress about health insurance and women's contraception.

Still, where "Punk" departed most markedly from traditional yoga classes was in the music. Instead of soothing Indian or New Wave sounds, the play-list consisted of Tune-Yards, Modest Mouse, and HotChaCha.

So one might wonder why the armory was decorated, 100 years after Lee's surrender, in any kind of Southern motif at all. But the decorating committee wasn't thinking of the negatives. I imagine they let the imagery of swaying Spanish moss, mint juleps and magnolia blossoms capture their imaginations. They could have tried northern themed decorations, but a faux assembly line, the smell of burning coal and a soundtrack roar of a locomotive might have been just a bit off-putting to ball goers.

No U.S. senator had visited Fossil before. Last week Judge Jeanne Burch, a title equivalent to Multnomah County's chair of the board of commissioners, recalled that the impending visit made local organizers nervous.

I've tried to explain to my kids what a volatile and violent time that was. I don't think they can grasp that the entire country was torn apart. People were at each other's throats over Vietnam, and the Kent State killings, and the draft, and civil rights, and feminism, and long hair, and rock 'n' roll. For the most part, it was the old vs. the young. Time magazine wrote about the generation gap. Gap nothing. It was a chasm.

Even so, it remains to be seen if slots in fraternal organizations' lodges remains a matter of local courtesy. At this point, there's legitimate reason to believe a slots parlor at a legion post in northern Harford would take away from what's played at the Hollywood Casino in Perryville.

As soon as people begin realizing there's more to this brief little slice of existence than hate and war and the constant drumbeat of fear, there's always resistance, a reactive sneer at the idea that people might be waking up, even a little, and it's all in the name of protecting the status quo and defending the power base and not upsetting any of those carefully wrought prejudices, about making sure everyone stays quiet and doesn't ask any difficult questions of the Authority.

You could say I'm guilty in a way, too. I often convey criticisms from readers who ask me not to use their names, or whose identities I never even know. I think it's implicit that I don't require identification in my open solicitation for feedback.

I don't want to suppress ideas by insisting on total transparency from my callers, but it's also a proverbial grain of salt to keep in mind.

The DVD starts with Eno’s brief tenure in the band Roxy Music. For most of his career, he has shown little interest in the trappings of rock stardom and celebrityhood. But when he was in Roxy Music, he dressed to shock, with glittering, futuristic outfits, lipstick and eyeliner, and lots of feathers. He partied hard and courted the press, making outrageous statements and provocatively labeling himself a “nonmusician.” (This was at the height of the progressive-rock era, when musicians were all striving to outdazzle each other with their virtuosity.)

It would be creative. And you'd have to find that second guy to go with him. But I'm telling you, I wouldn't want to be the defensive coordinator in that game."

"It's so easy in hindsight to blame a play-caller for a certain play because it didn't work," former NFL player Ross Tucker said during a Wednesday afternoon interview on KSLG radio. "That's always in hindsight. There are a lot of good plays where it was a horrible play call but the defense just screwed up. And vice-versa. There's some great play calls but an offensive lineman misses a block or does this . . . and it doesn't work either. I've never been a big guy second-guessing play-callers or offensive coordinators.

Of course you can, but in this case my answer was an enthusiastic "Yes, Mistress!" And see the film we did, in all its incredible, NC-17-escaping, hard-core glory.

It seemed to me that "Shortbus" was a struggle at the starting gate, and I had come to see the all-too-familiar idea of making a "good" porn film, or a mainstream cinematic Hollywood release with "real" sex in it, as just another director's wet dream to do something shocking or culture-affecting that would shudder and twitch into another forgettable puddle of obscurity.

In "Jenny," a traveling salesman is madly in love with the research product he demonstrates, a refrigerator that can be made to talk and think like an idealized version of his wife. In "The Epizootic," the U.S. is swept by an epidemic of people killing themselves for their life insurance. The principal industry of the country has become "dying for a living," a very Vonnegutian idea. "'Hundred-Dollar Kisses," cast in the form of a legal deposition, describes how two corporate executives start brawling over girlie magazines and a prank phone call. In "Guardian of the Person," an MIT engineering student drives to Cape Cod with his new bride to take full control of his inheritance. "With His Hand on the Throttle" features Earl Harrison, a successful businessman, "an empire builder by nature, annoyed at being shorter than most men, massively muscled, self-made, insistently the center of any gathering," who ignores his pretty, young wife and instead devotes himself to the burgeoning model railway system he's got down in the basement, tracks he rules like Napoleon.
Walsifer said she knew she wanted to marry Matlosz after their first date four years ago.

Pedro Alvarez, the all-or-nothing slugger from the Pittsburgh Pirates, launched the first homer off Westbrook this season in the top of the sixth inning. Alvarez's seventh homer of the season gave the Bucs a 3-2 lead against the Cardinals and hinted at the trouble Westbrook had in the third time through the lineup. Neil Walker opened the inning with a single, and later in the inning Garrett Jones singled. Westbrook escaped further damage in the inning when No. 7 hitter Clint Barmes popped up an attempted bunt. The Cardinals righty then got back on the ground and coaxed a double play.

4 One of the most dramatic U.S. air disasters occurred in Sioux City in 1989 when a Chicago-bound jetliner suffered catastrophic engine failure and crash-landed, killing 111. Heroic crew efforts saved 185 others. Iowa also was the scene of crashes fatal to boxer Rocky Marciano (1969, near Newton), members of the Iowa State women's cross-country team (1985, in Des Moines), and South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson (1993, near Dubuque). But none was as famous as the tragedy on Feb. 3, 1959, "The Day the Music Died." Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper, J.P. Richardson, were lost in an air accident near Clear Lake.

There is an art to the sports-figure apology. In most legal cases, athletes need to be careful not to admit they were guilty.

Q: Hey, Tony: I wish everyone would take it easy when it comes to the Browns' lack of participation in free agency. History is against teams who spend large amounts of money for free agents. A team needs at least three to four good drafts in a row in order to stockpile their roster with the young talent necessary to compete for years to come. And you can't evaluate that talent if you constantly want to sign 30 something players who at best will give you three years of progressively diminished play. -- Gary Alfrey, Medina

Sure, Kraggerud made a few concessions to Baroque practice. A harpsichord was in place (but faintly heard). Some, but not all, of the phrasing and rhythmic inflection, had a certain cut, reminiscent of what Baroque specialists do.
