The routine works this way: Once the mission has received clearance for a visit, the regime withdraws its tanks from central districts of the city concerned, leaving behind armored vehicles with security forces keeping a low profile.

One last data point: Portman endorsed Romney early, on Jan. 19, and worked hard to help Romney win the crucial Ohio primary on March 6. Rubio waited until March 28 to endorse -- two months too late to help Romney in the Jan. 31 Florida primary. If loyalty matters, Portman beats Rubio hands down.

He has warm brown eyes, a quick smile and a fist bump so powerful it threatens to leave bruises.

The story goes as follows: The GOP student group at the University of California at Berkeley wanted to illustrate its opposition to pending legislation that would allow state universities to consider race, gender, ethnicity and national origin as factors in admission.

For Americans traveling overseas, the pain of the waning dollar couldn't be clearer, and economists say it may soon hit a little closer to home. In some cases, it already has. The sagging dollar gave an immediate boost to gas prices, and it could influence the price of everything from T-shirts to electronics as American businesses loose buying power overseas.
One young man who identified himself as Definition Sean Perkins said, "I think she'll be happier up there with God rather than being married to that guy ... (and) struggling." A former middle-school classmate of Za'Zell's, Eboney Ellis, stood on the stage and looked right down into the open casket, weeping and apologizing for "not being there for her."

NEW YORK — Forget that there are 161 more games to play over the next six months. Turn and walk away from anyone who wants to diminish the importance of the Mets’ 1-0 victory over the Braves today, or anyone who mockingly wants to remind you the Mets almost always win on Opening Day.

This six-pack began as a hunt for Sauternes and Monbazillac, France's two noble sweet wines based on Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon. Those seem to be in short supply on the market - further evidence of sweet wines' tough mission - but it was only too easy to round them out with a handful of counterparts from elsewhere.

The Drudge Report headline, she says, is "really saying to all women, don't you dare step into the public sphere, we will savage you for what you look like."

"That is so empowering to so many women to hear the secretary of State say that."
Suicide is an act of desperation, often designed to end pain, when in fact it only spreads the pain of one to countless others.
Alas, I will not be able to make it to Indy this year. I have a personal commitment that's been planned for some time and one I presciently suggested should be held well after the postseason, just in case the Giants made some kind of run to the Super Bowl.

Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime is widely accused of atrocities as it battles to put down a popular revolt, and yet the prospect that he or any of his generals will be indicted soon seems remote. Syria does not recognize the International Criminal Court, meaning its prosecutors cannot act unless the U.N. Security Council asks them to. Russia and China would likely veto such a move.
A native of Jackson, Miss., Givens played his high school ball in Wylie, Texas, before heading to Wake Forest. He led the team in receiving yards all three seasons at Wake, and averaged 16.0 yards per catch last season.

Imagine officials say the rush to open shows their company can satisfy demand for educational options - and quickly. But to critics, the blitz has more to say about a charter school management company they say values enrollment and revenue over quality.
"I don't think anyone at Fox believes they are producing even-handed, impartial coverage. They think their mission is to balance what they perceive as a left-wing mainstream media by providing news and comment with a conservative slant. That's their right, but to say otherwise, to pretend to be something else, does strike me as cynical."

Painesville. The clinics include not only lead screenings, but also developmental testing, general physicals, immunizations, hearing and speech exams and nutritional counseling. Persons 20 and under can take advantage of the clinics. Durchik explains that the Health District can also direct families to other low-cost medical resources in the area.
As much as the schools deserve and need adequate resources, though, the effect on students as well as on other UC campuses would be a bad one. Because of recent tuition increases, the annual cost of a UC education, including room, board and books, already hovers between $25,000 and $30,000. That's a bargain compared with the full cost of many private colleges, but still a big nut for many middle-class families. (Students whose family income is less than $80,000 a year usually receive a free ride on tuition.)
According to Administrator Judy Sullivan, Bedminster Township received a map from the DOT along with the notice that the zoning ordinance was deficient.

In 2008, Sen. Barack Obama didn't win the presidency because he was black. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was black in 1984 and 1988 and didn't win. The Rev. Al Sharpton was black in 2004 and didn't win. No, Obama won because he was a Harvard-educated lawyer with charisma and vision who convinced millions of people that he could bring about change. He also was black.

Of art and literature, he would say that if they were "to be made accessible to all, they had to be made intelligible (and inoffensive) to all," and he carped about what photography, movies and condensed books did to art, which was flatten it. And, finally, of human aspiration, he lamented that "like no generation before us," we believe that "we can make our very ideals" rather than respect preordained ideals that we have to live up to.
What a cool concept: a family-owned Asian hypermarket. Kansas City has long been blessed with little specialty Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese markets. Emphasis on little. Many are tiny, and midsize ones often have the aisles crammed so close together they feel little. The new 888 International Market, 10118 W. 119th St., Overland Park, could not be more different. Walking through the automatic glass doors feels like stepping into Target  in Shanghai. Owner Tim Liu opened the store, which has almost 6,000 square feet, in December. The inventory is truly pan-Asian, with Korean, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese products as well as Chinese. Seafood fans should check out the competitively priced lobsters and crabs in tanks. Bubble tea lovers will want to check out the cafés new slushy versions, and the selection of frozen dumplings and pot stickers (pick up dipping sauces a few aisles over) is worth a trip by itself. Dont miss the housewares area at the far back of the store, where you will not believe the size of steamers and woks  up to 4 feet in diameter. Best value tip: on a recent visit, stems of Stargazer lilies with three or four salad plate-size blooms were $3 each. The checkout area induces an oddly happy feeling, with each lane decorated to the hilt with red banners, lanterns and lucky cats.

Assuming you both have jobs, are you going to keep your money separate and each pay certain bills? Or put all your money in one account? Best idea: each contribute a certain amount, maybe 50/50 or an amount proportional to what you earn - to a joint household account. Use that account to pay shared bills, ranging from rent or mortgage to food and utilities. Then you'll still have some spending money of your own in a separate account.

The first recipient of the kidney was Ray Fearing, a 27-year-old Arlington Heights, Ill., resident who suffers from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), in which scar tissue develops on the kidney and prevents the organ from filtering waste from the bloodstream. In June, a team headed by Dr. Lorenzo Fallon of Northwestern implanted a kidney donated by Fearing's 24-year-old sister, Cera. But, as is the case in about half of transplants to patients with FSGS, the new kidney began failing almost immediately following a recurrence of the disease. The surgical team knew the kidney would have to be removed, but reasoned that it might be saved if the procedure was done quickly.

Chip-and-pretzel lovers, Penn State researchers discovered, are supertasters. Not just of salt; also of bitter, sweet, fizzy and spicy flavors. If you're a salt-loving supertaster, not only do you like salty foods more than "nontasters" do, but you need salt to block out what you taste as bitter undertones in certain foods (like cottage cheese). In taste-bud land, salt balances bitter. You may not realize you're doing this; you just do it. To you, these foods taste bad without salt.

What a cool concept: a family-owned Asian hypermarket. Kansas City has long been blessed with little specialty Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese markets. Emphasis on little. Many are tiny, and midsize ones often have the aisles crammed so close together they feel little. The new 888 International Market, 10118 W. 119th St., Overland Park, could not be more different. Walking through the automatic glass doors feels like stepping into Target � in Shanghai. Owner Tim Liu opened the store, which has almost 6,000 square feet, in December. The inventory is truly pan-Asian, with Korean, Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese products as well as Chinese. Seafood fans should check out the competitively priced lobsters and crabs in tanks. Bubble tea lovers will want to check out the caf�s new slushy versions, and the selection of frozen dumplings and pot stickers (pick up dipping sauces a few aisles over) is worth a trip by itself.

What is it?: What we've all been waiting for, a playoff. A small one. The top four teams are seeded. No. 1 plays No. 4 while No. 2 plays No. 3. A week later, the winners play for the national title.

Christie and Codey had a public flare up In December, when Christie accused Codey of blocking former Attorney General Paula Dow’s Superior Court nomination and called Codey an “awful partisan.” Christie placed Dow temporarily in the counsel’s office at the Port Authority, replacing a cousin of Codey’s. Codey called the governor “childish.”
That's 25 years from now, and Mary Lou Zoback, a geophysicist and coordinator of the U.S. Geological Survey's earthquake hazards program, is more definite. She's 53 years old and on Monday she put it simply: "A damaging earthquake will happen here within my lifetime, I'm quite certain," she said. "Truly, there's no safe place to hide here in the Bay Area."
A place like this needs substance behind the concept, and there is plenty of promise at Enotria  a talented if tentative 28-year-old chef and an earnest (and new) 26-year-old sommelier. But Enotria needs a better game plan for them to showcase their talents.

As the Cardinals and Brewers renew pleasantries with opening day at Miller Park this afternoon, the striking similarity between the two rivals is who isn't here, not who is. Both teams lost elite first baseman to free agency. The Cardinals, you may have heard, were unable to sign Albert Pujols, the three-time MVP. Milwaukee couldn't match the offer Fielder received from the Detroit Tigers. The similarities do not end with the vacancies, however. Both teams have a ready-made MVP-type in left field ready to continue on without the slugger who hit next to them in the lineup. Milwaukee has Braun, the reigning NL MVP, and the Cardinals have Matt Holliday. The teams also added a known bat to help fill the lost offense.

He was clearly a big challenge to coach, but Maryland will miss a guy who could score as many as 25 points in a half, as Stoglin did in a win over Colorado.

Though history has come to view Simpson and Edward's relationship as a grand romance, Riseborough incarnates the character more subtly. Though the film doesn't downplay the sacrifices he made, it also plays up her doubts about their decision to pair. The couple were forced to live in exile for the remainder of their lives, and Riseborough shows Simpson as a woman whose joie de vivre was tempered by a sense of boredom and even melancholy about their existence.

As a Nigerian American, I knew the history well. A Nigerian military officer and politician, Ojukwu was the Igbo governor of Nigeria's Eastern Region in 1966, when ethnic and religious tensions among that nation's majority tribes - the Igbos, Hausas and Yorubas - led to a mass slaughter of Igbos across the Northern Region. An outraged Ojukwu declared secession of the Igbos on May 30, 1967.
If patients understand that their doctors are practicing high-quality medicine when they employ just the right care for a health problem — not less but also not more — we are on the way to solving the problem. Excess care is harmful as well as expensive. The insurance companies profit because they force patients to make unhealthy decisions based on finances, not medical need.

By far, though, Smith's conscience-driven reversal of his support for the war in Iraq was his most important decision. He made the choice after deep reflection and while under great pressure from the White House and Republicans to stay the course. His defection prompted others and pushed the administration toward finally developing an endgame in Iraq. The decision cost him support among GOP voters, which could cost him this election.

It would be silly to expect exact fealty to a 1960s sitcom. A musical has different requirements -- enthusiasm, gusto, big smiles. I get that.

Designer Marese Langan ("The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," "A Mighty Heart") does a remarkable job of taking away and putting years on Streep as she moves from Thatcher's late 30s to her 80s; makeup has gone a long way to help transform the actress (though the irregular teeth, complete with gap, are a bit disconcerting at first). But mostly, it is Streep's uncanny ability to disappear inside her characters that is striking here. (Alexandra Roach and Harry Lloyd enter the picture briefly, playing the Thatchers as a young couple.)

Many franchises began to cut spending in advance of the lockout because of the uncertainty surrounding the new CBA. Would there be a hard cap?

4. Draft Blackmon: A lot of experts say Blackmon would only touch the ball six or seven times a game while Richardson would handle it 20 or more. But Blackmon would impact the game on every offensive play because he has to be accounted for. If a defense has to roll coverage to Blackmon, it would open things up for Greg Little, who's poised to take a big step forward this season. Again, it's a passing league and the Browns run the pass-oriented West Coast offense. It's easier to find a quality running back in later rounds than it is an elite receiver. Heckert said last week that the Browns passing on Julio Jones at No. 6 last season had everything to do with the boatload of picks they were able to get, not the player.
We were fortunate to have had Small as our veterinarian for the first few years of our beloved Jack Russell terrier's life.

A: U.S. student loan debt has surpassed credit card and auto-loan debt, with some estimates putting it at $1 trillion. This debt jeopardizes the fragile recovery and increases the burden on taxpayers. About two-thirds of student loan debt is held by people under 30, according to the New York Fed.

O’Donovan is another childhood player turned soccer dad (he coaches his sons’ teams), and remembers playing in Ireland alongside cows in the fields, feeling lucky when he was kicking a ball that was actually inflated. “It’s a poor man’s game.” But in America, O’Donovan is also eyewitness to a grass-roots evolution.

Health at Every Size (HAES), a new movement aimed at promoting health for the overweight, has grown in popularity among both health care experts and their patients. HAES suggests that the negative attention focused on weight can do more harm than good. Linda Bacon, Ph.D., Associate Nutritionist at the University of California, Davis, discussed the benefits of HAES at the American Dietetic Association conference. She reported that a paradigm shift toward eating "intuitively" may help promote health among the overweight. Intuitive eating counteracts the chronic dieting mentality by focusing on issues such as eating for physical, not emotional, needs, and relying on internal hunger and fullness cues. "Several studies show intuitive eating leads to weight stability or weight loss. When we trust our bodies and let go of 'rules' and ideas about eating, our bodies get it right," said Bacon.
