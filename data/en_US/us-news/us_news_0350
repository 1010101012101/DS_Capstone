There is nothing wrong with Hollywood fantasy, but I fear that young girls out there are going to have unrealistic expectations of how first-time sex really is. Ask your daughter if she thinks the love scene is realistic. What has she heard about what sex is like? Use this conversation to discuss the right time and place for sex, and what realistic expectations might be. Discuss the gift that sex is (under the right circumstances and the right person). And, in my opinion, this also is a great time to start talking with your daughter about discovering her own body and pleasure. I can assure you that if she owns her own sexuality, she will be much less likely to be swept away and make impulsive and unhealthy decisions later.

Thus serious BMX competitors train not the way I do for triathlons and marathons, with cardiovascular workouts, but rather with explosive, strength-based movements: dead-lifts, sprints and the like.

It's a shame. But after years of constant criticism from insiders and partisans, Straub is making the right move -- for himself and for the city. He deserves to walk away from what has become a political mess and take his reformer's message somewhere that is more welcoming. Even though the public turmoil is largely not his fault, it's best for the city that a new leader comes in without the baggage that has been accumulated.

Seafood testing begins when there's no longer visible oil in a particular area. First, inspectors smell samples for oil. Then comes testing at federal or state laboratories.

Second baseman Daniel Descalso contributed a pair of opposite-field two-run doubles to account for four of the Cardinals' six RBIs in a 6-2 win at Space Coast Stadium. Descalso and catcher Tony Cruz (3-for-4) enjoyed multihit games for the visitors, who improved to a National League-best 16-8-1 this spring. ... Base coaches Jose Oquendo and Chris Maloney switched stations Saturday with Maloney moving to third and Oquendo to first. Matheny explained the swap as giving Maloney experience receiving and giving signs in case Oquendo were to be ejected from a game. Maloney, who worked the third-base coaching box while managing Triple-A Memphis, handled the assignment without incident. ... Rather than throw a simulated game or appear against leftover minor-league players in camp next Wednesday, Westbrook will throw an extended bullpen on opening day in Miami. ... The Cardinals plan to take regulars Matt Holliday, David Freese and Rafael Furcal on Monday to Springfield, Mo., where they will play their Double-A affiliate.

Propagandists and politicians use an over-reliance on secrecy to shape popular opinion and suppress dissent.

Walter Moore:"I oppose Measure B. . . . It is little more than a vague plan to come up with a plan. Measure B, moreover, would unjustifiably give the DWP a monopoly or near-monopoly over solar power. I would prefer to see local businesses compete with one another to provide the best possible service and lowest prices to consumers. After all, this particular form of power -- unlike a massive coal or nuclear power plant -- lends itself to decentralized ownership and control. Nor has Villaraigosa shown how much his proposal would cost us, and why we should put all our "eggs" in the solar basket rather than alternatives like wind power, on which Germany relies, or nuclear power, on which France and Japan rely."

Harrison caught 3 passes for 28 yards. I maintain that Harrison will need to regain his 2010 form for Rutgers to have a viable offense. His starting counterpart, Brandon Coleman had 3 receptions for 25 and a score. But it was the reserves that made some noise. Senior Timothy Wright continues to show that he is fully healed from his August 2010 injury as he totaled 7 catches for 66 yards. With Quron Pratt sidelined and not playing, Wright is looking to grab the role of intermediate and underneath route runner as the Scarlet Knights look to replace Mohammed Sanu’s 115 receptions last year as a group effort.

Echo Park resident Joseph Lee doesn't necessarily look like the leader of a musical movement. Blanketed in thug-like tattoos, a menacing goatee and often photographed in bandanna and Tupac Shakur tee, Lee could easily pass for a long-lost member of Cypress Hill.

A city that, as Plascencia writes in "People of Paper," is surrealistically named "for the hills it does not have?"

Though investors are betting on yet-unprofitable companies such as Zillow, experts say the current fever for Web stocks is hardly the bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are far fewer companies going public, and the ones that do have been around longer and have established business models. That wasn't always the case in the '90s. Menlow said, back then, investors didn't even look at the companies they were snapping up, and only asked "how many shares can I get?". He noted that investors are being more careful these days.
This is another empathetic film by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly. Thomas Doret plays Cyril, the title role in the film. We meet him in a boys home where he was dumped by a father who promised to return but never has. Like a young detective, he methodically tracks him down — visiting the bar and pastry shop his dad took him to, calling a phone number that is always disconnected, talking his way into his dad's former apartment. The film shows a boy who fears he has been thrown away. (Roger Ebert, Universal UClick) 87 minutes

"The Child" and "The Son." Over and over, their subjects are parents, children, alienation, rebellion. But the Dardennes love these characters and do not blame them. They attend to their pain. They find goodness and share happiness. The most mysterious character in "The Kid With a Bike" is not the kid, who after all has a story that's fairly easy to understand. It is the hairdresser, played by Cecile de France with her sad beauty. This actress carries lifetimes in her eyes. There is a moment here when she is forced to make a choice, and as she makes it, she reveals so much about how she got to this place in life. "Why did you let me come here?" Cyril asked her. She says she doesn't know. As she makes her choice, we sense that she knows very well.

But guess who doesn't read very much either? That would be John Edwards, if you believe John Heilemann and Mark Halperin's new book "Game Change."

It's true that most states that have casinos already permit casino lending. It's also true that elimination of Missouri's prohibition on casino house loans would be the latest, and perhaps the last, of the state's precautionary operating restrictions to fall.

Chris Dufresne, Los Angeles Times: "Golf legend Tiger Woods' breakup with Elin Nordegren . . . is the cautionary tale on how love-life turmoil can affect competitive greatness. Woods' well-manicured career imploded in 2009 after an SUV accident revealed enough sordid secrets to give Harvey Levin a spinoff series. Winner of 14 major championships and 71 PGA Tour events, Woods hasn't won a sanctioned PGA event since. He crumbled in Sunday's final round against the cherubic and seemingly love-struck Phil Mickelson. Golf is hard enough to play as an abstinent monk, let alone for a philanderer who built a corporate empire on a cultivated, wholesome public image that turned out to be a duck-hook out of bounds."

Wine pairings: Greens fancied up with grilled meat, different vegetables/fruits, cheeses and dressings make these salads interesting wine partners. A variety of wines like today's recommended summer whites will work, as will weightier examples like white Rhones (for the grilled eggplant salad) and Vermentino (with the chicken kofta). The grilled pork salad includes nectarines and a sweet-tart mustard vinaigrette that won't fare well with minerally, austere bottlings, so try a fruity rosé. Dry pinks would also be good with the chile-rubbed steak salad, as would a light red like a Gamay.

To be honest, as interesting as all this trivia was, I'm not much of a history buff, even a bar history buff. I'm more interested in the recreational here and now. I floated by her my theory that a bar such as Bemelmans at the Carlyle Hotel, one of those detailed in her book, may actually be more economical than someplace like the White Horse or the Dublin Inn. At the latter bars, they serve drinks in thick-sided glasses that create the illusion of plenty but find themselves in urgent need of replenishment after only a few miserly sips. At a respectable hotel bar, on the other hand, they may change $15 or even $20 for a drink, but they typically don't scrimp on the alcohol.

A mile west, in the new Kukui'ula Village development, from Ko'a Kea (the former Po'ipu Beach Hotel), Hawaiian Regional Cuisine co-founder Peter Merriman caused excitement a year ago when he finally expanded from the Big Island and Maui to Kaua'i. Merriman's Kaua'i is distinctive in offering both mountain and ocean views, including gorgeous sunsets, and advertises that 90 percent of the food is locally grown or caught using sustainable methods.

And the toll that takes; the way people understand their lives have no meaning in society. It's a terrible and corrosive thing. What does this make you feel about your life? I don't have the words to explain what it does to them, to know that the person who is the star in their world gets killed and nobody cares. I don't have the language for it.

Overall, traffic on the Turnpike was about the same for the first four months of 2009 and 2010, with about 73 million riders for the first four months of each year.

I had never heard of Burger King but figured it was worth a try, and my teen-age palate was pleased with the discovery.
