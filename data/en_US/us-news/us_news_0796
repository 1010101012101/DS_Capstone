Why else would the Justice Department challenge the photo ID law in Texas? To charge Republicans with seeking to disenfranchise Hispanics and blacks, of course.

A: I have not seen the Caveon report. I asked the Blue Ribbon Commission for it June 9th. I did not receive it. I questioned early on — it was very clear they were focusing on 12 schools. They were using an analysis that the 58 schools were the whole universe, not taking into account that
Hey, Andy: The strength of schedule is determined by adding the final records of all the teams played in a given year. It is used to break ties in draft order only. The team with the lower strength of schedule -- easier schedule -- wins the tie-breaker among teams with the same final record. I think Griffin needs to be evaluated carefully by the Browns and should not be dismissed as a possibility with their first pick.

Al Jamal, a restaurant/nightclub frequented by locals and visitors alike, is a microcosm for Istanbul itself, a city full of contradictions. The first lies in its identity crisis. It is the only city in the world that straddles two continents, with the main business and tourism sectors in Europe and most of the residential areas in Asia. The struggle over whether it's inherently European or Asian can be seen in its two major palaces. The Topkapi, once the residence of sultans, is straight from "The Arabian Nights," and the white marble Baroque Dolmabache Palace, with its 4-ton chandelier and luxurious gardens, is a testament to those same sultans' desire to introduce European savoir-faire to their Middle Eastern domain.

The Olympics will be held in June in London, and the world-record holder in the marathon will not compete. Patrick Makau dropped out of the London marathon last month with a hamstring injury.

Romney advisers see those voters as potentially helpful in several states, including Pennsylvania, another Democratic stronghold they are eyeing as a possible target.

A: On "Mala Noche," I had a storyboard that I followed on the set. We had a small 16 mm camera so I was able to put the actors in place, set the camera and shoot what I had drawn. With "Drugstore Cowboy," I also made a storyboard, except the 35mm camera and crew moved a lot slower. I didn't just have one camera man -- I had a whole crew, and all of a sudden, I was unable to follow the storyboard because it was a lot more complicated than the number of shots I could get. So I had to improvise. Since then, I've made up the shots on the spot.

Top Budget panel Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said the food aid cuts would mean 280,000 children would lose free school lunches and 1.8 million people — out of 46 million currently covered — would lose food stamp benefits while large agricultural businesses would continue to receive lucrative subsidies.

In the formal living room, the curved outer wall is lined with towering windows. Ceiling beams, spread like spokes, draw your eyes to the views. A white baby-grand piano stands at one side of the room. Two Castilian-style tall-backed chairs, with lion heads on the arms and leather seats, sit like thrones facing the window. A curved sofa provides additional seating.
He said he hopes to develop his art, and find a way to merge it with his other love — math.
"Girls" may be construed as tragic by old-school feminists. If you aren't intrigued by a story in which overeducated, underemployed young women seek rude sex with slacker guys who treat them poorly, you may be offended. Really, though, "Girls" is just the latest in a long TV tradition of efforts to pin down the feminine perspective.
Who knows where this might lead? It looks like the third-ranked UO women are at least as good as advertised, and the men’s team could skip the rebuilding phase altogether.
Compare that with statistics from neighboring Orange. The mayor's court in that town saw 23 traffic tickets per 100 residents in 2010, slightly above the state average. Police in Orange wrote 751 tickets while covering an area almost four times larger than Woodmere.

Townsend said competition from food trucks was the main reason her cafe business has failed to take off.

Last year, the festival raised $30,000 for local charities.
With all the talent returning all over the field, I don't see any reason why Dodd and Nova can't lead Rutgers to do what Tom Savage once arrived on the Banks to do. Accepting Savage back would likely disrupt the chemistry behind the team unless the piece of humble pie he's eaten is gigantic. To me, it's not worth the risk and I'm sure Savage will do well going to another school. I'm sure he will do well wherever he goes, but once you leave it's hard to accept any player back.
A well-researched and iconoclastic documentary that is both thoughtful and troubling, "The Pruitt-Igoe Myth" is indeed a cautionary tale, but what it cautions against is the lure of easy judgments derived from prejudices and ignorance of the facts.

which are 6 to 8 inches long, typically spend three to five years in the ocean before returning to the Columbia and its lower tributaries between February and May. In the ocean, they are a forage fish, living on plankton but in turn eaten by larger fish and marine mammals. Scientists don't know how smelt find their way back to the river from the ocean, what kind of habitat they need or why returns can be very small one year and quite large the next.

The report may also give new impetus to efforts to ban or phase out the use of plastic bags at grocery stores. The number of plastic bags collected more than quadrupled from 2,793 in 1993 to 12,873 in 2009. Plastic caps and lids also soared from 6,947 in 1993 to 33,551 in 2009.

In February, President Barack Obama proposed reducing the deficit with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases. He would let the Bush-era tax cuts expire for couples who earn more than $250,000 and set a 30 percent tax rate on those making more than $1 million.
Brockovich: I think that there's complacency and apathy throughout our country, and we think the EPA is going to come and save our butts on these types of problems, and they're very absent for a whole host of reasons. We have been completely failed. Then a film comes out or there's some convergence and people realize: "Oh (expletive), this is in my backyard." The issue is more relevant and more daunting today than when I began my work in 1991.
The first time "Pomp and Circumstance" was played in a graduation setting was when Elgar received an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 1905. At the end of the ceremony, the march was performed as recessional music. It was so well received that it was soon expected to be played during graduation ceremonies at other prominent schools. Today it is rare to hear "The Graduation March" played outside of commencement ceremonies.
Kemp is sent off with Sala (Michael Rispoli), a staff photographer who has been on the island long enough to know how things work (and how they don't). They end up rooming together in a pit of an apartment, which occasionally is shared with Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi), a reporter who never works and is about as far gone to seed as is possible without rigor mortis setting in. An odd fellow, he listens to records of Hitler speeches for fun and strains fluid through stolen hotel air-conditioner filters to make some sort of souped-up, brain-cell-destroying liquor.
Glen Taylor is the biggest reason the Timberwolves are still in Minnesota, having saved the team from moving to New Orleans when he swooped in and bought the franchise in 1994.

This after Lawson was as invisible as Claude Rains and Metta World Peace in Game 1. The Energizer Bunny had no alacrity. Lawson scored seven points, none in the first half. Afterward, Nuggets coach George Karl told his point guard "(he) wanted me in the paint at least 10 times a game."
It’s not the first report of the unexplained in North Bergen. The city may seem like a humble suburb wedged between Weehawken and Fairview but it is actually the UFO capital of New Jersey. Forget about the Pine Barrens. Based on an abundance of sightings over the past three decades, the hilly town along the Hudson River is a hub for other worldly mysteries.
"The belief is we can win this series. You look at it and say, 'We're very lucky there's another game.' A lot of competitions are one game and you're out," Joy said. "To actually get another chance so quickly is perfect for us. Because everybody is so angry and everybody has to turn around and put in a good performance. If we don't put in a good performance, we will be out."
So what? UCF is joining a BCS conference it should be able to compete in almost immediately — unlike many longtime members of the SEC and other BCS leagues who haven’t been able to compete for generations. As UCF football coach George O’Leary has said many times, “Just because you’re in a BCS league doesn’t mean you’re a BCS team. Some of these programs are just members only.”

Although Lanigan goes to fancy restaurants and eats things I can't even pronounce, he gets sloppy sometimes when he eats during the show. He puts so much cream cheese on his bagel, when he bites into it, the cream cheese gets on the end of his nose.
The mere suggestion that he could just disregard a ruling sent the legal community into a frenzy.
To many members of the law enforcement community, the growth of the state's medical-marijuana industry is a plague that threatens to increase marijuana use of all kinds among teens and young adults — with disastrous results for the state.
And each Christmas, Nordin, like every other child in Crockett, would receive a color-coded card from C&H in the mail. Following the annual company-sponsored production of "The Nutcracker," he stood in line with the rest of the kids to exchange his card for a gift.

Beth Ryburn — in red lipstick and a flowered caftan — and her husband, Richard, get up from their seats. With her husband’s help, Ryburn walks carefully down the steps and slides into a wheelchair waiting outside, and the couple returns to the hotel where they stayed before Ryburn’s heart surgery.
This season, the Junior Billikens posted a 13-15 overall record and 0-8 in an MCC that includes perennial powers CBC, De Smet and Chaminade and a resurgent 26-1 Vianney team.

Walter "Bud" and Irene Baker still consider the church where they married 53 years ago to be a central part of their lives.
Short stuff: And, by the way, you know Dwight's in a desperate spot when Shaq is one of the few people who have come to his rescue. Shaq and Dwight have had their differences, but I guess there comes a time when Van Gundy-disparaging superstars must stick together. … Question: What's more uncomfortable to watch - a proctology exam or Dwight obliviously interrupting Stan's press conference Thursday? … LeBron had "The Decision" and LeDwight has "The Insurrection." … I have to admit, I'm a little worried, too. How long until Dwight goes to Sentinel management and demands that I get fired? … But, really, shouldn't Dwight go to management and demand that Tiger Woods' swing coach be fired! ... To think, all of this Magic drama came to a head in the wake of WKMG Channel 6 sports anchor David "Ping" Pingalore breaking the story that Dwight demanded Stan's removal as coach. And now for the words this franchise never wanted to hear: "Ping may have profoundly altered the future of the Orlando Magic." …
"Jill is everywhere," Cal women's rowing coach Dave O'Neill said Saturday.

CLARENCE, N.Y. — A candlelight vigil is planned to mark the third anniversary of the deadly crash of Continental Flight 3407 near Buffalo.
-- Rabbits get nervous if you pick them up but let their feet dangle, and that can be a problem for kids who like to carry around small pets. When a rabbit is being held in such a way that it feels nervous, it will kick, and that can upset some kids. Mother rabbits don't pick up and carry their young, Morrone said, so nothing prepares them to be carted around.
Doug is a relentless spaz, Kayleen relentlessly unhappy. When they first meet on the playground at age 8, they compare maladies. Doug's head, in what will become a familiar motif, is swathed in a bloody bandage. "I broke my face," he gleefully announces to Kayleen, "playing Evel Knievel" by riding a bike off the school roof.
Although Hansen did not cite the trio by name, San Clemente assistant football coach Jeff Veeder told the Register in November that he expected a letter would be placed in his personnel file. Veeder said at the time he didn’t know what the letter would say, and declined to discuss the matter subsequently; it’s unclear if his letter was a form of disciplinary action.

Seven of the 13 council members -- representing south Minneapolis, downtown and University neighborhoods -- have said they oppose the mayor's plan to pay the city's share of a $1 billion stadium using existing hospitality taxes, absent a citywide referendum. The state and the team are expected to pay for the rest.
No matter how the money is spent, it makes sense to eliminate the break for multi-state corporations that allows them to pick which of two formulas they want to use as the basis for their taxes each year. By switching to a system that would tax these companies based only on their sales in this state, the bill would bring California in line with other states, give companies more of an incentive to locate and hire here or at least not move away, and raise about $1 billion a year. This page has previously encouraged such a switch, as has the state legislative analyst.
One look and these folks make you go: "Oh, yeah. Dalai Lama. Here. Buddhists. Of course."
Women also should be aware that signs of heart problems differ for men and women.

"I landed a great deal for the raw material, the wood," Smatana explained, "and I just started experimenting with making baseball bats. Or as I like to call them – man sticks."
Maier, making her 10K debut on the track, is chasing the 27-year-old school record of 32:40.76 by Kirsten O'Hara, second-oldest on the books at Cal.
Contemporary examples of faith used as a divisive tool abound. Daily news headlines -- bombings in Baghdad and Lahore, a recent mosque desecration in the West Bank -- remind us that those who claim to be agents of God's will continue to wreak their havoc in too many corners of the globe.
They further argue that the Forest Service "suppressed evidence of this misconduct in an effort to protect its position" in a tangle of litigation.
Lewis posted the lowest round ever for an amateur in the British Open, beating the 66 posted by Frank Stranahan in 1950 and matched by Tiger Woods (1996) and Justin Rose (1998). The youngster also became the first amateur to lead a round at a major since 1976, when Mike Reid was up by three strokes heading to the second day of the U.S. Open.
The report released today, which was overseen by the acting president of Rowan, Ali Houshman, did not shed much new light on the issue.
But no one should spend much time worrying about this scenario now, not in light of the child-sex-abuse scandal that has ripped apart the Penn State program. Paterno is out, but there are two big reasons Schiano probably won’t be a serious candidate as his successor:
A second, an opaque watercolor representing a small section of the Illinois Central's huge division yard in Waterloo, was painted in 1950 from a third-story window in East Waterloo High School when McRoberts was a senior. "My wife and I had never gone on a trip where we traveled first class," he said. "So, in 1989, we went first class to New Orleans to see a Rodin show. I have a model of the exact car we were in. It has six compartments and 10 roomettes."

participate in our Animal Blessing. It's part of our 5:30 Eucharist and (weather permitting) will be held outside. We always say that "all are welcome" to our worship services, but this one time of year we not only extend our welcome beyond denominational differences--we overlook distinctions between species!
The Cincinnati Reds' six-year extension with second baseman Brandon Phillips, which they announced Tuesday, means they have guaranteed nearly $450 million to six players who will make up a part of their roster through at least 2014. In the past two months, the Reds have guaranteed first baseman Joey Votto $251.5 million, Phillips $72.5 million, and pitcher Sean Marshall $16.5 million. They are now signed through 2023, 2017 and 2015, respectively.
But Price, who was already familiar with the Y Combinator model, said he likes the idea of debt or revenue sharing as a way to buy investors out of the business in short order. And he's not put off by the $250 application fee.

Congratulations, Minnesotans -- you're all set for winter, right? You've dug the galoshes out of the closet, found your gloves in a coat pocket, dusted off your parka and tried on your furry bomber hat to make sure it still fits.

The other night I came in with some friends. They had a classical music CD being played on their sound system. I meet people for dinner on the early side. It's a noise thing. The more people --- more noise. I actually would like to hear what the other person is saying.
The studios will argue that they’re only serving the audience, and the most recent data from their lobbying group, the Motion Picture Association of America, seems to bear them out.
The decision allows the Fire District to start funding a design of the new station. Firefighters currently work in a small building at 223 N. Main St.
He said the mayor's large salary sent the wrong message about the city's leadership -- that the mayor is expected to take on a bulk of responsibilities that should be reserved for council as a whole and executed by staff. Hurst suggested staff become more involved in the community speeches and appearances. "I think that's why we seek out the quality of staff that we have," he said.
The players who were on the court answered some of the questions about the team's lethargic offense, playing crisply and unselfishly. The offense featured a lot of movement, particularly from Batum, who often received passes as he curled through the lane. He hit 8 of 14 shots, the most he has scored in the preseason.
"I think journalists should have the right to express their opinions on the topics they cover," Arrington writes. "More importantly, I think readers have a right to know what those opinions are. Frankly, I'd like to know sooner rather than later just how insane some of these people at CNN and Fox News are. To stop them from giving me that information is just another way to lie to me."

According to statements that were read Thursday by police officers in 36th District Court, Conaway was sitting in Cain's van, which was parked in the driveway of his house on Glastonbury in Detroit about 2 a.m. Feb. 8 after an evening at a topless bar.
A grand entrance: Lawrence dazzled on the carpet in a stunning gold Prabal Gurung dress, Jimmy Choo shoes and Jacob & Co. black diamond earrings. But her onstage appearance was pure clumsy girl-next-door. As director Gary Ross introduced her, Lawrence seemingly couldn't wait in the wings. She made a move for center stage, thought better of it when she saw that Ross was still talking, and then comically dived back behind the curtain. When Ross finally did call for her to come out, Lawrence tripped during the walk to center stage. "She's good at comedy, too," Ross laughed. As she walked off, Lawrence noticed Hutcherson was mocking her walk. She turned and, in front of the crowd of thousands, laughingly gave him a Hunger Games three-finger salute . The crowd roared with delight.
BOULDER — Four minutes remained in Friday's Class 4A championship game when D'Evelyn guard Laura Tyree made a clean steal and went in for an uncontested layup. The ball rattled around the rim and then fell harmlessly to the court.

Secreto owner Barbara Brown's ex-husband, Richardson Browne, opened Richardson's Cuisine of New Mexico, which burned down in July 2009. Together they opened Dick's Hideaway and the Rokerij, both acclaimed restaurants in north-central Phoenix.
The deadlock over disclosure marks an ironic twist for the agency, considering its history. The downfall of President Nixon revealed not just political dirty tricks but also how the flow of secret cash had bought favors in Washington. In 1974, a reform-minded Congress adopted strict limits on the funding of campaigns, along with disclosure requirements. Congress created the FEC to enforce the new law.
But Detroit didn't cause the housing bubble or the Great Recession. It is bizarre that Wall Street's excesses cause the mess and then the bill is sent to the victims.

The proposal was scheduled for a vote earlier this month, but Council Member Judy Johnson said she wanted more time to hear reaction from city hotels.

The questions only seem to intensify when it comes to sleep. First, where should baby sleep? In a bassinet, in your bed or in a crib? Once baby is in a crib (if you choose to go that route) should you sleep train? Which method is right for you? Should you allow baby to "cry it out"?

The crab is an ocean crab, smooth, without spines, and singularly coarse and tasteless. As a rule they serve it as cracked crab, which means that they steam it, chill it, and cut it up quite nicely, with the shell cracked so you can pick out the meat with an oyster fork. I think it would be better if they didn't let the ice come in contact with the crab, and thereby suck out the salt, but I hope they don't begin taking pains with it, just to please me. Any way they served it, I wouldn't like it. The only good crab I ever had out here was the other night, at a little party in Beverly Hills. It was in a salad, and I at once sought out my hostess.

My favorite hot appetizer is yose dofu ($16), a fresh tofu made tableside and served with a dipping sauce with fresh wasabi and green onions, and a mushroom sauce.

That might have been wise politically, but the justices' questions indicate that structuring the insurance reforms as a tax would have made it easier to defend the law. The Anti-Injunction Act would have barred anyone from challenging the tax's constitutionality until after the IRS started imposing it in 2015. And because Congress' power to levy taxes is extremely broad, anyone suing to block the law in 2015 would have faced an uphill battle.

you're wondering if the Packers are better this season than last, they are. And those concerns about a Super Bowl hangover? Forget it. The Packers must have taken a couple of aspirin and chowed down on some White Castle sliders after they partied in February.

Most of us get health insurance through our jobs, a system puzzling to the rest of the industrial world, where the government levies taxes and offers health coverage to all as a basic right of modern society. But for many Americans, their way feels alien — the heavy hand of government reaching into our business as some bureaucrat tells doctors and patients what to do.

Now, American and Israeli officials believe breakout is unlikely anytime soon, according to administration officials. For one thing, Iran, which claims it is interested in enriching uranium only for peaceful purposes, would be forced to build nuclear bombs from a limited supply of nuclear material, currently enough for two weapons. Second, such a decision would require kicking out international weapons inspectors.
As a season’s worth of Dwight Howard-related uncertainty came to a close tonight, Nets general manager Billy King did not come forward with the superstar everyone had expected at the trade deadline, but he did his best to rationalize what the team had ended the day with.
The real shocker was Phyllis Cleveland's appointment as chair of the Planning Committee, replacing one of Sweeney's (former) ardent supporters -- Joe Cimperman. The Planning Committee post is an especially big deal in that the chair traditionally gets a seat on the city Planning Commission, a body that wields substantial power and influence. Cleveland, of course, is Sweeney's majority leader and point person on the East Side. If she sought an even bigger leadership role on council, chair of the Planning Committee is a post that provides her with ample opportunity to show her mettle.
I was never a big fan of the PSP. It's central idea -- offering full-fledged console games on a portable device -- never made sense for mainstream consumers. To them, games on a portable device are largely meant to be played in passing as time killers. There's just no time for such consumers to get sucked deep into a console game while riding the train or waiting in line at the grocery store.
"Please leave this store," she told a reporter.
GM also revealed Monday that it will permanently close nine more plants and idle three others.
Whether pitching a product or wooing a job candidate, Jobs liked to paint what he was selling as part of a revolution, an idea that reverberates in Silicon Valley start-ups today.
"Reggie Watts: A Live at Central Park": Two things: this is airing at 1 a.m., which means that technically it's on really early Saturday morning. But I suspect the people who'll watch will consider it really late Friday night. The other thing: that time slot's a tipoff that this is adult material, which you'd expect of Watts, whose comedy/music performances can feature language that's saltier than multiplex popcorn.

5. LOS GORDITOS RESTAURANT (1212 S.E. Division St.; 503-445-6289; losgorditospdx.com): This restaurant has its origins in a popular, still-running taco truck, but with a full kitchen, they're building on their cult following with extensive vegan and nonvegan options. Vegan nachos get their pizazz from soy chorizo -- you won't miss the melted cheddar -- and you'd be hard-pressed to come up with something more satisfying than the plump soy-curl tacos.
øAssociate athletics director Paula Jantz told Kowal in a 2008 memo that, going forward, a trainer would provide daily injury reports and that no injured athletes could practice unless cleared by medical staff.

But that rush of official attention and investment had consequences after years of neglect.
For lovers of well-turned phrases, though, Mr. Baldwin has plenty to offer. The Seine was "chopped up white and blue"; in a night of fog, "each streetlamp had its own heavens"; on a cold morning, a cigarette protrudes from a cracked car window "like a snorkel." There are spot-on social observations, too, from the absurdly high French tolerance for sexual harassment in the workplace to the propensity of the French for making crazy intellectual overstatements and for obsessing over obscure American authors like John Fante.
øEmotions were mixed in the Devils' locker room after Tuesday morning's skate. There was the optimism - as Parise said - of opportunity for certain players, but also the crushing disappointment of not having one of the team's best players available for a critical game.

I was walking the Fancy Food show floor with one such futurist, Kara Nielsen, the "trendologist" for CCD Innovation, a San Francisco-based food research and development firm. We passed a vendor of Malaysian food—a cuisine I had rarely seen—and I excitedly turned to Ms. Nielsen, wondering if this was an incipient find. "It's in the pipeline," she said, matter-of-factly. Another vendor hawked Indonesian food, which I had not seen in the U.S. "It's further off, but it'll come." Cambodian was on the way, too.

It's possible this spring in a Cactus League game utilizing the DH, the Rockies could start six players who were born in the 1970s, and Moyer, born in the '60s.

He said he tried to obtain flood insurance last month, but was blocked because of a missed deadline.
I don't blame you for being skeptical. We've heard a half-dozen deadlines that were not met. However, the fact that Checketts and Game Plan are suggesting that it will be done before the start of the season isn't a hunch. As we discussed earlier in the chat, there are bank deadlines involved now. Checketts got one extension, but he's not going to get another. The Blues must be sold very soon. To me, it's not a matter of if the Blues will be sold soon. The question is, will the five groups involved come anywhere close to Checketts' asking price before he has to sell it? Will they try
Hundreds of people marched through downtown Minneapolis on Friday afternoon, stopping traffic and forcing officials to block off several streets and divert traffic.
Also, Asia's largest budget carrier—with a $3 billion market capitalization—should pick up more passengers as Malaysia Air cuts capacity. Already in the first quarter of 2012, AirAsia's passenger traffic from Malaysia was up 12% compared with last year. Revenue was up sharply, and while net profit was down, that was mostly because the year-earlier figure was boosted by one-time foreign-exchange gain.
Maag and gun-rights advocates are also pushing separate bills to allow guns in more public places. They recently won the right to bring guns into bars, which still makes me jumpy when I order a beer and a shot. But I see these efforts as less offensive than 422, which will heighten tensions during traffic stops.

It was a surprise how well Xavier, which finished 39-6 (just two losses to Arizona teams), played this season. The team graduated firepower and also lost some to injury and illness. At the start, Xavier looked to have five senior starters. By the end, at certain points, it had just one with a freshman, two sophomores and juniors on the floor. The one constant was Preach.

Honkin' tip: Consider buying a portable jump-starter. Honk did this week after his old one pooped out. He stores it in Mrs. Honk's car in case that vehicle's battery goes dead and needs a quick jump. He paid $100 for a nifty Black & Decker model; that brand also sells one for $70 and there might be less-expensive jump-starters available. Even though the Automobile Club of Southern California would come out, this route is faster and more convenient.

Roger Moore, McClatchy-Tribune News Service: * * The design borders on '70s sci-fi silly. Director Ross and his designers give the District 12 scenes a Great Depression-era pall of brown and gray. But the city folk are straight out of "The Wizard of Oz" or Dr. Seuss, with everyone from government officials (Wes Bentley) to TV presenters (a funny Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones) wearing outlandish eye makeup, overly colorful costumes and Cindy Lou Who hairstyles.
Hey, Andy: I'm not sure about all those numbers. All I know is that when I watched Sabathia in 2007 and Lee in 2008, I knew they were front-of-the-rotation ready. Close the stat book, turn off the laptop and trust your eyes once in a while.

Passing storm: Tipoff's old pal Burt Graeff, the former Plain Dealer Cavs beat writer now spending retirement blissfully stress-free in the desert sun, shot us an email last week after we reported on Brad Sellers' candidacy for Warrensville Heights mayor. It was Sellers, Graeff reminded us, who, while playing for the Chicago Bulls, inbounded the ball to Michael Jordan in a 1989 playoff game against the Cavs. Jordan jumped high over the outstretched hand of Craig Ehlo, and "The Shot" became a part of Cleveland's miserable sports history.

Chip Taylor is a white-haired curmudgeon with a sweet smile and a way with a tune (he wrote "Wild Thing" but also "Angel of the Morning"), and he's been especially prolific in recent years. Pushing the pendulum away from his album of children's music last year, Taylor now serves up this gentle, thoughtful but certainly adult set of countryish ballads. The title track is a gem beyond its viral-worthy chorus - a growling but hardly menacing dirge advocating the overdue marginalization of the blemishless (while frequently assuring us, "I'm not talking 'bout you"). Backed by a new band of mostly Swedes, plus guitarist John Platania (who played on Van Morrison's "Moondance"), Taylor purrs through amusing but meaningful laments ("Passport Blues," "I Know Dark," the wondrous "New Things") like J.J. Cale without the shuffle. Much of the record is as soft as "Chet Baker Sings," but what it carries really sticks.

The film paralleled his own search for his parents, who had been in Auschwitz. "I don't know if it changed him, but I know it emotionally affected him," said his son. "He was the kind of person who never revealed how he felt to anyone — at least to me. But I am sure it was extremely traumatic for him because he had just found how his own parents had been killed as he was doing research in Germany."
Gilbert estimates the museum would have used up its $1.4million in credit by early February, and takeovers often take weeks, possibly months, to complete. Since January, PNCA has yet to chip in money; the museum is instead using its remaining credit to pay for daily operations.

That said, I really do like Busch Gardens' big-ticket item for the summer, which looks every bit of its $20 million-plus price tag. Although it's not scary, it is incredibly cool. It zips smoothly at 60 mph, which is only a bit slower than SheiKra. It never loops, but there is a high heartline roll (like a corkscrew) and a 130-foot drop that can catch your breath but good.

One, we need to get Schlereth pitching better, said team president and general manager Dave Dombrowski. He has not really thrown very well, which we have told him. He pitched very well for us the second half (of last season), but he has not pitched well this year. We do need another arm to protect us at this point. We like (Schlereth), but he consistently hasnt thrown strikes for us, mostly with his fastball. When he has gotten out there he hasnt done a real good job.

Rhode went to the municipal building wearing a diaper under his pants to apply for a public defender, a day after he had pleaded not guilty to a motor vehicle violation in municipal court. When the court administrator stepped away from the counter to get him the necessary paperwork, Rhode soiled his diaper, Schwartz said. When the court employee returned, she gave him the paperwork, and Rhode left.
A: You're on the right track - an FM transmitter is the way to go. For readers unversed in such, an FM transmitter is a very small device that attaches to an iPod (or iPhone, or other music player with the proper connection). It converts music emanating from the player into an FM signal, which a car stereo can receive just like a radio broadcast. The beauty of an FM transmitter is that it requires no physical connection to the stereo.

Western military officials call the late-night strikes one of the most successful means of capturing and killing insurgent fighters and field commanders. But the raids are widely loathed by Afghans, who consider strangers forcibly entering their homes and seeing the family's women to be a grave cultural affront.

If Neuman had said yes, she would have had to report the relationship to GE, she said.

“All of these cities' systems have unique features that set them apart. Portland's public transit provides riders with a variety of travel options, including buses, light rail, commuter rail, streetcars, and an aerial tram. New York is unique simply by virtue of high ridership: in 2008, 4.2 billion trips were taken on New York metro area subway lines, buses, and railroads, six times the number of trips taken in Los Angeles, the No. 2 city. Minneapolis and Portland both feature fare-free transit routes in their downtown areas. And the Salt Lake City area's Utah Transit Authority runs ski transit lines in the winter, in addition to its usual rail and bus services, and also features wireless Internet on its buses.”

NORTH CAROLINA: Voters approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman, making it the 30th state to adopt such a ban. State law already bans gay marriage, as do nine other states, but an amendment effectively slams the door shut on same-sex marriages. The amendment also goes beyond state law by voiding other types of domestic unions from carrying legal status, which opponents warn could disrupt protection orders for unmarried couples. Six states — all are in the Northeast except Iowa — and the District of Columbia allow same sex marriages. The North Carolina amendment was placed on the ballot after Republicans took over control of the state Legislature after the 2010 elections, a role the GOP hadn't enjoyed for 140 years.

The chronology of the Bible places the time of Abraham at around 1800 BCE, roughly 4,000 years ago. There is ample evidence that child sacrifice was common in many civilizations at that time. A contemporary reader in 1800 BCE might have been surprised if Abraham did not sacrifice his son at God's command. Some scholars believe that in the original version of the story, the sacrifice did occur. It was a later modification, a new moral teaching, that God did not want animal sacrifice.

Sociologist Christine Carter of UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center is author of the advice book "Raising Happiness: 10 Simple Steps for More Joyful Kids and Happier Parents" and teaches parenting classes (www.raisinghappiness.com). She says a first step to instilling empathy is to help children understand their own emotions, including giving them vocabulary for describing their feelings. So if a child has been aggressive to a friend, a parent can say, "Wow, you must have really been hurting to do something like that," she suggests, or "jealous" or "frustrated," etc. "You can say, 'It's OK to be jealous, but how you behaved was not OK.' " That gives the child a word for what he was feeling, lets him know that feeling bad is OK, but that mistreatment of a friend is not.
