The term "evangelical" refers to Christians who claim a personal relationship with Christ and consider the Bible the word of God, to be faithfully obeyed. They are a huge group -- about one in four voters -- and far from monolithic; their ranks include Pentecostals, charismatics, Southern Baptists and many others. Some worship to rock music, others to hymns; some speak in tongues. Some believe God preordained those headed to heaven; others hold that anyone can achieve salvation by accepting Jesus Christ as their savior. Former Presidents Carter and Clinton are evangelicals, as is President Bush.

SPRING DANCE CONCERT
Holmes says he was born without a "nasty" gene. That is to say, he is not bothered by things most people would consider nasty. Holmes is a man of medium build, with a salt-and-pepper beard. He has a deep, soothing voice, that of an airline pilot or funeral home director, which he once was. He has worked in the coroner's office as an investigator or coroner for 35 years. He likes the sleuthing, the search for answers.

Portland goalkeeper Troy Perkins is having none of that kind of chatter.
One clue may be how spiders process liquid silk into a solid fiber. Before they eject it, they bathe it in mild acid, extract water, and squeeze it enough to stretch and refold the silk's long protein chains. The result is a material superior to synthetics, without the high heat and harsh chemicals needed to make Nylon or Rayon. "It's green chemistry at its finest," Blackledge said.

And they show Petrino and Dorrell claimed to have ended the intimate part of their relationship once it became clear she wanted to apply for a job under Petrino - one he wanted her to "earn." She was hired March 28 and has since resigned.
The 78th, the Bolingbroke book, was found as part of a multi-year search through the Library Society vaults to record the thousands of volumes it contains.

In its latest safety action, Toyota said more than half of the vehicles under recall were being added to a massive 2009 recall that fixed gas pedals getting trapped in the floor mat.
"Dean was hard to play, because everything about him was iconic," he says. "The slouch, the look, even the way he held a cigarette. Capturing that physicality was part of my job, because I knew it was one of the things people were going to be looking for. Still, you don’t want it to be a caricature, a ‘Saturday Night Live’ sketch. You have to find a way to take the outward behavior and the inner life and put it all together in a way that feels natural." Franco did, and his rise continued. He auditioned for "Spider-Man" and, although he lost out to Tobey Maguire, got the plum role of Harry Osborn instead, a villain in training with definite daddy issues. More films followed, including the retro war movies "Flyboys" and "The Great Raid" and the less-than-epic epic "Tristan & Isolde." But few of them impressed audiences, and eventually they began to depress Franco.

The fans responded with boosted attendance at Vols games, which prompted athletics officials to upgrade the school's cavernous Thompson-Boling Arena and build a new basketball practice facility.
I'm a little concerned about Mr. Cain's 9-9-9 tax thing. What is to keep the 9-9-9 tax from rising to a 11-11-11 tax or maybe even a 14-14-14 tax? The government needs more money, so they raise it up and raise it up. Pretty soon we won't be able to buy a cotton-picking thing. I'm frightened of that. There seems to be an open end to increase it. Is anybody else afraid of that?

Holmgren: "I heard it. The whole thing bothered me, not just the tape, but the whole idea bothered me. This is a very rough game at times, without specifically getting into that sort of thing. At the league meeting at one of our sessions that we were in most teams got up and spoke to that, and New Orleans was in the room, it went around the room and we talked about our feelings about that. My comment was that in all the years I coached I don't believe we ever did that. I wasn't in the defensive room most of the time so I don't know for sure. The idea of targeting somebody, specifically like that and having money put into a pot for that reason, that's wrong. There is no place for that in this sport. It bothered me and I hope it never comes up again."
Parents routinely make sacrifices - for principles, for money, for survival. The hardest ones are those that tear us away from parts of our soul - our children, our families.

First, most millionaires pay high taxes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the richest 1 percent of Americans have an average tax rate, including payroll taxes, of 29.5 percent. (By contrast, the tax rate for the poorest 40 percent of Americans is 7 percent.) The same top 1 percent pays about 28 percent of all federal taxes. Buffett and some other super-wealthy are outliers, because their income is mostly from dividends and capital gains, taxed at 15 percent.

We would serve our young better if we cease blaming harmful behavior like unwed teen pregnancy on the economy and, instead, give consideration to the role of weak parental guidance, government entitlements, sexual messages conveyed via the media, and our failure to help the young learn that responsible behavior today can yield a better tomorrow.
The combo meal feeds you and gives you $10 to play video games. Not bad. But the prizes you can "win" are incredibly cheap and cheesy. What's more, there is an electronic theft detector where the prizes are kept. Do people really steal ugly pillows and stuffed monkeys?

In 1986, though, he got one of the leads in the film “Sid and Nancy,” a sometimes strangely funny, sometimes surprisingly romantic look at the life of the doomed Sex Pistols bassist and his junkie American girlfriend.

Loser: Notre Dame quarterbacks during the 25th pick. Denver, the most active team in the first round by far, traded up with the Ravens to take a huge risk in Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.

The price calculations were titled heavily in Boeing's favor by a procedural maneuver pulled off by Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington state, sometimes called "Mr. Boeing" in the halls of Congress.

A complex, century-jumping narrative about the great Renaissance scientist, a modern astronomer and a Creationist, each with their willful offspring, “Dear Galileo” attempts a reconciliation of fathers and daughters, faith and science, psychology and cosmology.

Dos carnes ($19) - "two meats" - was indicative of the overall approach. The two meats in question were medallions of hanger steak and small mounds of braised beef cheek, each offering distinctive, varied and full-bodied flavors. Cakes of potato gratin enhanced with poblano chiles were arranged around the meat, with roasted green onions wrapped around the cakes and three-leaved sprigs of cilantro artfully arranged on top. Tying it all together was a thin foundation layer of salsa borracha ("drunken sauce") that started with flavors from mid-spicy dried red chiles and orange juice and finished with complexity, perhaps owing in part to the tequila that gave the sauce its name.

Those vacant structures not only depress the value of neighboring properties, they also are staging areas for criminals. Since many -- if not most -- are mere shells at this point, there is no realistic prospect of returning them to the market. The best, maybe the only, solution, is to tear them down. That removes blight, creates open space and raises the possibility of future constructive use.

The second period was as one-sided as most college football games in September. The only reason the Flyers survived was Bryzgalov, our current favorite child of scorn. Whatever your opinion, you have to acknowledge this much: When the Flyers have needed him the most - as things began to crumble against Pittsbrugh; in the first period of Game 1, when the Flyers were shaking off a week's worth of rust; in the second period Tuesday night - the guy has been very good.

U.S. economic expansion fueled heavy immigration in the 1990s as Mexicans found jobs in construction, service and other sectors. For instance, Mexicans were instrumental in turning Arizona into a fast-growing state and its capital Phoenix into the country's fifth-largest city.

My largest concern with this film was that it was going to be a movie made simply because the books were popular and would not be a serious film.

They should be expected.

The texture is wonderfully luxurious, a perfect match of pasta and topping. Close behind would be Terje's pappardelle with braised short rib ragout with roasted chanterelles ($12/$16).

It’s here the movie most requires our indulgence. The nature of these characters — aliens? angels? — is left open. Their dress, meanwhile — including what turn out to be somewhat magical hats — suggests a meeting of existential ad executives.

Separate egg whites by gently cracking the eggs. Use your hands to gently and slowly separate the eggshell over a measuring cup. Allow whites to drip into the cup. Carefully transfer the yolk from one half of the shell to the other until all the whites have dripped into the cup. Repeat until you have 1 cup of egg whites. Discard eggs if yolk accidentally mixes with whites. Yolks prevent meringue from solidifying.

Now that thrill-seeking diners have advanced beyond pork belly and crispy pig's ears and are going hog wild over snout-to-tail pork events, it may be the perfect time to check out Koreatown's best jokbal. The braised pork foot and shank, Korea's answer to charcuterie, often shows up boned and sliced as anju — the snacks served in pubs and other hangouts for hard-drinking night crawlers. But few versions will thrill the souls of pork junkies as completely as jokbal from the homespun Jangchung-Dong Wong Jokbal on Western Avenue.

During the decades it took for the court to come to its senses about segregation and sexual privacy, there were always lots of people on both sides of the arguments. By contrast, as Dahlia Lithwick points out in Slate, the notion that healthcare reform with an individual mandate might be unconstitutional was virtually never heard of until the bill passed and the "vast right-wing conspiracy" went to work. Professor Randy Barnett, the intellectual father of the commerce clause argument, didn't really start churning out scholarship on the subject until 2011. During the whole debate over Obamacare, it seems, nobody noticed that it was unconstitutional. Now every conservative politician and pundit finds it not just unconstitutional but obviously so.

The result is a sort of mythological overload, but De la Cruz has, with "Witches," once again managed to enliven and embellish upon history and mythology with a clever interweaving of past and present, both real and imagined.

Maybe that's better than being thought of as "The Mistake on the Lake." Or hey, remember when the Cuyahoga River caught fire? Randy Newman immortalized that with his song, "Burn On." That could be the theme song of the convention.
Wu had refused interview requests for months and hired an attorney, Michael Simon, who aggressively attacked the paper's reporting and sought to stop publication. When the story ran three weeks before the election, Wu quickly apologized for his "inexcusable behavior" and was handily re-elected.

The most famous couturiers -- Lanvin, Patou, Schiaparelli, Balmain -- created exquisite miniature fashions displayed on wire mannequins to show that the Parisian couture houses could be reborn.

Siemens Chief Executive Eric Spiegel plans to unveil its new index later Thursday at the Aspen Ideas Festival.
Now that spring is here, the garden will start getting out of hand. Weeds will flourish, snails will come out of hibernation, and throughout the Bay Area, wisteria will bud out in great profusion. The Chinese varieties (Wisteria sinensis) burst into pendulous clusters like fragrant, delicate clumps of grapes hanging from leafless stems. Japanese varieties (Wisteria floribunda) bloom later when their leaves unfurl, opening cluster by cluster in elongated, 18-inch-long drifts of blossoms. To have a wisteria that doesn't bloom is like sitting down to watch a play that never begins. And while you can't teach a young vine old tricks, you can encourage an older non-blooming wisteria. Now in early spring, feed it heavily with superphosphate (0-20-0); then in late spring or early summer if no buds have appeared, severely prune back the new growth; and finally in late fall, prune the roots by using a shovel shoved straight down 2 feet out from the stem.

"You've got to remember that's applicable to 27 summer Olympic sports, what about the hundreds of other sports that are signed up to the code?" he said. "We can't have one rule for Olympic sports and another for all the other sports."
"It's all about customer service," says Miller, adding that he and Ankoo pay attention to the way clothes fit their shoppers and will tell you if something looks good -- or if it doesn't.
In the land of "Tim & Eric," there is no "too much." Over-the-top isn't something to be evaded, it's an ethos. Packaged in public-access TV production and frenzied, chopped-up editing, it has the hyper pacing you'd expect to find in a Japanese TV commercial.
It's enough to make librarians so proud they'll want to Go Tell it on the Mountain.
A majority of Americans support the use of contraceptives. The public is generally in favor of requiring birth control coverage for employees of religiously affiliated employers, according to a CBS News/New York Times poll Feb. 8-13.

Even Catholics, whose church strongly opposed the recent government mandate, support the requirement at about the same rate as all Americans.

Given the new course ahead of her — involving diaper changes and sleepless nights, instead of Jell-O shots and sleepless nights — season five of the show, which will wrap up this month, is looking quite stale. In it, Polizzi has squabbles with her boyfriend, Jionni LaValle (yes, now father to her child), reminisces about her liaison with a cast member and wears the cartoonish head from an oversized rabbit costume that she has adorned with cosmetics and calls "Lola, the hooker." So stale, but entertaining.

The head of the International Monetary Fund on Monday urged indebted countries in Europe and elsewhere to reduce their budget deficits only gradually to avoid further damaging their economies.
Honda, which makes 80 percent of the vehicles sold in North American at plants in the region, also said it will be able to import only a limited number of Japan-built cars in the U.S. That means dealers won't be able to order the Fit subcompact, and the CR-Z, Insight and Civic gas-electric hybrids until later in the year.

These efforts have yielded two tangible results: lightning-fast execution and slashed trading costs. The floor of the New York Stock Exchange is witness to this shift. The number of floor brokers has shrunk by half, to 1,500, in just five years. Actual trading on the floor is less than 10% of volume.

Since peaking at $3.98 a gallon on May 6, gasoline has fallen by about 20 cents to a nationwide average of $3.77 a gallon, according to AAA's daily fuel gauge.
I would also note that the inclusion of union dues is irrelevant. It seems you are trying to make some point here that has nothing to do with the impact of Measure B. If your point is to demonstrate what the take home paycheck looks like, I would suggest you also include taxes and any deductions for health benefits (which average about $3,100) and are far larger than union dues. If you wish to show union dues, while still ignoring these larger issues, then I would check the figures you are showing. I believe AFSCME is the only union that represents Librarians, and no one in our bargaining unit pays more than $483.12 per year.
I heard it over lunch one day last week from a conservative Republican senator with three years of seniority. He was bitterly disappointed that he did not find the collegial, challenging body that his predecessor had described to him -- or the cross-party friendship that Vice President Joe Biden had told him he once enjoyed in his travels with a Republican counterpart from the senator's own state.
AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said the new guidelines were needed to clear up confusion among unlimited customers over when their download speeds would be slowed. Mr. Siegel wouldn't say how significantly speeds would be reduced.

"We cannot prevent the Israeli officials from making statements," he said. "But what we are saying is that we are not in a position, nor is it useful at all for advancing the cause of democracy in Syria, to engage in a complex issue that will probably detract from the focus on the people of Syria at this point."
Another theory is that the Reds worked Chapman as a starter in spring training, and that gave him a chance to develop his slider and split-fingered fastball. Chapman pitched well enough in the spring to earn a spot in the rotation, but when relievers Ryan Madson and Nick Masset went down, Chapman was moved back to the bullpen.

Not sure its worth a whole column, but I went to the boys OSAA tourney last night. There were 4 Portland teams on the evening schedule. The lower bowl was barely 1/2 full. Tickets had been increased to $12 for g.a. and $15 for reserved. What part of "its the economy stupid," does the OSAA not get? For holding the line on ticket prices, they probably make it up with the inflexible prices on concessions and parking that also keep adults and students away. Its lousy when they can't fill the lower bowl with an evening schedule of 4 local teams.
Lastly, Hendrix is perplexed by the indeterminable number of unemployed who have abandon the job search when an offer doesn't materialize in timely fashion.
"The positive things are our power play is hitting pretty good," Trotz said. "We're back home, where we can be very comfortable and get this thing back on the rails, which is really good. We know what we have to correct, it's just a matter of getting it done."

A deputy patrolling the Lincoln Shields Recreation and Conservation area after dark noticed a car parked in the dark parking lot. As he approached, the car started to drive away. He stopped the car and had the two male and two female occupants exit the car. A search of the car resulted in the discovery of a clear plastic bag containing a small amount of marijuana. The two men, both 22, maintained the drugs were theirs and subsequently were arrested for drug possession and trespassing. One of the men was also found to have an out-of-state warrant and was taken into custody. The two females were released.

While its too early to make sweeping judgments, I stopped in for a first look at the new space Monday night and shared some dishes with a friend. The orecchiette  small bowl-shaped pastas  with braised rapini (a broccoli-like vegetable), anchovy, garlic and olive oil was simultaneously complex and comforting with mellow flavors and perfectly cooked pasta. Toasted crumbs on top added nice crunch. The pappardelle with wild mushroom ragu was a simple, classic combo of pasta and earthy, full-flavored mushrooms.

The Jane Doe Law provides free access to services to collect evidence using a sexual assault evidence collection kit and represents a major evolution in providing victims of sexual assault expanded avenues to achieve justice. Most significantly, making a police report before evidence is collected is no longer necessary. In fact, results of sexual assault evidence collection kits are kept on file anonymously, even if the victim never makes a police report.
Lilly recalled that the vicious attacks seemed to start when she was about 9. Her adoptive mom became suspicious that her much younger husband was molesting the girl. If Joe said she was pretty, Lilly said, her mom would savagely beat her until she admitted to having sexual contact with him  which wasn't true. Then Horvath would get furious and pile on.
At 6-4 and 215 pounds, the Jets envision him as a potential Calvin Johnson-type player and he should beat out Chaz Schilens and Jeremy Kerley for the No. 2 job. He's also a ferocious blocker — perfect for New York's run-first offense. Throw in Ganaway, a 5-11, 240-pound bull of a back who'll team with big-bodied Shonn Greene, and Ryan's desire to have a true "Ground-and-Pound" approach appears to be set up nicely.

Back in 2008, Pettitte mentioned a few times in his own deposition to Congress that he might have misunderstood Clemens. At one point, under prodding from a congressional investigator, Pettitte said, "I don't think I misunderstood him."

You'll see similar offers for discounts for extended stays and advance payments, and resort credits at other Hawai'i lodgings this summer. Not surprisingly, they tend to be heftiest at the most luxurious — and therefore highest-priced — digs, such as at the four Four Seasons resorts, the Kahala Resort on O'ahu and the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on the Big Island. But little family-run motels and bed-and-breakfasts cut rates for longer bookings, too.

It’s hard to imagine another actress who would take on this role – who would accept this woman as she is without making the usual self-serving requests for some redemptive arc.

"Saying that we are trying to authorize guns in bars is a complete misrepresentation," said Jeff Garvas of Ohioans for Concealed Carry.

Waist size, it turns out, is a super-accurate way to measure risky belly fat. You may have some on board if your waist measures 35 inches or more for women, or more than 39 inches for men. (Put a tape measure around at your belly button -- and suck in!) But the health risks that come with belly fat actually begin about 3 inches before that! So, if your numbers need a trim, focus on strategies that build muscle. Lean body tissue burns calories around the clock, preventing or even reversing belly-fat expansion. Don't simply diet; slashing calories slashes precious muscle mass, too.

�� Say wha-a-a-t? . . . OK, we know election nights are pretty exciting, what with all the cheering and glad-handing and what have you. But is the governor's memory so short that she forgot an election night of just three months back?

But maybe there is a kind of weird logic to Penn's adventure in Haiti. He is an actor whose most famous roles are underdogs and whose politics frequently put him at odds with the U.S. government, embracing the likes of Venezuela's socialist President Hugo Chavez. Haiti is a land of contrasts and contradictions, a poor country in the shadow of the United States, a place of inspiration and despair.

It's easy to get annoyed with this new, self-described "dinerant." That term alone gets our hackles up. Then there's the insistently cheeky menu, with its doughnut burgers and lobster corn dogs. Puh-leez! But in the interest of fairness we gave it a shot and found some darn good food.

Hey, Tony: Here's a few moves for the Browns to jump start their search for talent. First, trade Josh Cribbs and a draft pick (third round?) to Eagles for DeSean Jackson. We need speed. Second, draft Robert Griffin III as our new QB. Pick best RT or speed OLB with second first-round pick and use second-round pick on the position that we did not pick up in Round 1. Look for depth at defense (LB and/or DBs) and at RB (since they will not resign Hillis) in free agency. Keep either McCoy or Wallace as backup QB. Thoughts? -- Steve Smith, Cincinnati

Yet this is a sport that always rewards an intemperate disposition. And surely, its players always find interesting methods by which to motivate themselves. We've even seen them do this by hitting each other in the head in pregame — repeatedly, with helmets optional — and engaging in group discussions that make the Bill Romanowski's famous, slack-jawed rant on bacon eaters and boar hunters sound erudite.

I began at the western door, whose twin-towered facade is the postcard image of Westminster Abbey — ironic, because the towers are much newer than the rest of the gothic structure. The original abbey was consecrated in 1065. Henry III began building the present church in 1245, but the towers weren't finished until 1745. If you look up above the western door, there are 10 statues of Christian martyrs, which also appear to be ancient. In fact, they are all 20th century figures (the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is among them). These statues were carved in the 1990s in the medieval tradition. The abbey used its own craftsmen for the work.

Hey, Jim: Briefly, the Browns are better on the defensive line, in the secondary, and, yes, at receiver (with Greg Little). I believe their overall coaching staff is good. Dick Jauron and Ray Rhodes were excellent additions on defense. The disappointments center on the offense -- overall lack of production, inconsistency on the offensive line, a breakdown in the running game and subsequent unproductive play at quarterback. Keep in mind the new offensive system is only six games old. As for the Hillis soap opera, his mind obviously has been affected by the melodrama. The running game in general also has suffered.

Dialogue has in fact already begun. At least two rounds of talks have taken place this year, in Qatar and Germany, between U.S. officials and Syed Tayyab Agha, one of Mullah Omar's closest lieutenants: almost certainly the first high level contact between the two sides since 2001. The talks, according to most reports, were exploratory rather than substantive -- talks about talks at best -- and even these were nearly torpedoed by the glare of unwanted media attention. But they represent an important start, and a useful platform to build upon.
Farmed salmon is just what it sounds like: salmon raised and caught on a floating salmon farm. Although these fish are given chances in life that their wild counterparts aren't given (including a steady supply of food) they don't really make for a better-tasting or more-nutritious fish. They are often times more fatty and lack the bracing taste of a good wild salmon.

The measure, led by Republican Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah and taking the form of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, would allow the dis-enactment of "any provision of law or regulation" upon the vote of two-thirds of the state legislatures. Champions of the effort point out, no doubt correctly, that such a two-thirds' vote would be difficult to obtain. What's more, Congress could simply re-legislate what the states had repealed. That, they say, should cinch the matter, offering protection from potential abuse of the power to dis-enact laws and making the amendment acceptable to everyone.
