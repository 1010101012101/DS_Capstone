All had been Wells Fargo clients only to find in 2007 and 2008 that they were caught in losing positions they blame on risky investments that the bank had long marketed as safely conservative.
The first is that lack of enthusiasm or usage by certain population segments in a pilot project will translate during full deployment. New technology takes time to get used to and needs some form of education so people are able to take full advantage of the benefits. In reality, the pilot project has been just that, an initial reaction to a new technology in an information vacuum. Once smart meters become more and more ubiquitous, government and utility outreach won't be the only entities providing customers information. Besides friends, family, neighbors and co-workers trading information on how they are saving money, entrepreneurs and companies will be developing and marketing products and services (i.e. simple in-home devices, software, apps) that will help people understand their options and opportunities to save money.

"The biggest problem when oysters are poached from polluted waters is, if they get to an irreputable dealer, they are going to put a tag on them saying they came from a legitimate harvester — and if someone gets sick, boom, everything is shut down," said Steve Fleetwood, whose Bivalve Packing Company has harvested oysters from the Delaware Bay for 30 years.

Equities fell earlier after the ISM services index decreased to 53.3 in June from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion. The measure was projected to drop to 53.7, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The slower pace is a sign the economy cooled at the end of the first half of 2011.

A: Ficus nitida is a tropical tree, and it does stress in too much cold (below freezing) and too much heat (above 105 degrees). Your trees are reacting to the extreme heat. Place the water hose at the base and let it soak the area around each tree for 10-12 hours on a slow trickle. Ficus burn and self-reduce their leaf numbers when stressed. Keep this up for the next three to four weeks. This should stop the immediate leaf drop.

Mr. St. Aubyn believes sales spiked in part because readers had access to the entire series. "The advantage of having been neglected for so long was that when all five books arrived at once, they had more impact," he says. Mr. St. Aubyn recommends reading the books chronologically but says he often hears from readers who came to the books out of order and enjoyed them just the same.

U.S. regulators largely cleared the company earlier this month, saying that electronic flaws were not to blame for reports of sudden, unintended acceleration that led to hundreds of complaints. Transportation officials tied the problems to mechanical defects dealt with in recalls and "pedal misapplication," in which the driver stepped on the accelerator instead of the brakes. The company has, however, paid the U.S. government a record $48.8 million in fines for its handling of three recalls.

Many women do not show up at abortion clinics because they choose. Most women did not willingly plan an unwanted pregnancy, did they? No, it is a consequence of a sex act that resulted in "whoops" or a sex act they were forced to have unwillingly. In either case, the man is accountable, and it was his choice!

Ohio was the center of the campaign for the last week, and Romney once again outspent his main challenger. If Santorum overcomes that disadvantage, and scores a sorely needed upset, it would bolster his claim to be the anti-Romney choice that many conservatives have been looking for. At a minimum, Santorum needs wins in Oklahoma and Tennessee to remain a plausible threat. Elsewhere on Super Tuesday, a lack of campaign cash has hurt him badly. In Georgia, for example, he had little media presence (Santorum says he bought cable TV time, but Romney and Gingrich "super PAC" ads flooded the airwaves and he was invisible); as a result, the former senator could fail to qualify for Georgia’s 31 statewide delegates, which would increase the loser’s share that goes to Romney.

"He never gets mad," she said. "Ever. He never gets really physically upset. He's calm. He will just go to his room and think about stuff when he's upset. He's weird that way.

The new guidelines offer a welcome change from USDA’s tradition of using the National School Lunch Program as a dumping ground for meat and dairy surpluses. Not surprisingly, 90 percent of American children are consuming excess fat, only 15 percent eat recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, and one-third have become overweight or obese. These early dietary flaws become lifelong addictions, raising their risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

Learning isn't just about the memorization of facts. Teachers understand - and you probably do as well if you remember your greatest classroom experiences - that discussion, collaboration and working on projects together as a class can have a huge impact on student learning. Students are most engaged when they work in teams and wrestle together with complex topics. Collaborative problem solving, socialization and working with other people are key to getting along in life. That's much more difficult to achieve in an online environment.
"Aung San Suu Kyi's parliamentary debut is neither a game-changer nor a sign that Burma has reached the tipping point of democratic transition," said Maung Zarni, visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and long-term exile activist.

Charles P. Pierce, ESPN.com: "This is the 20th anniversary of the Kentucky-Duke regional final that is reckoned to be one of the best tournament games ever. It ended with Christian Laettner's jump shot, as we all know from the endless replay of the moment on CBS, where it is the One Shining Moment of all One Shining Moments. Apropos of the anniversary, here are a couple of things that will not be mentioned as the assorted Kelloggs and Vitales reminisce about that game. The first is the fact that Laettner should not have been in the game to hit that shot. He should've been thrown out for deliberately stomping Kentucky's Aminu Timberlake earlier in the contest. The second is that Laettner, along with his Duke teammate and close personal friend Brian Davis, has gone on to a second career allegedly stealing other people's money, which has resulted in the two of them owing various people $30 million. Apparently, one of those people is Shawne Merriman. I'm not expert in defrauding people, but I'd say it is advisable not to defraud professional linebackers who have the PED doctor on speed-dial."

On a final note, Putnam also made the convincing case that religious Americans are overwhelmingly more "nice" (i.e. more generous, more voluteering, more communally-involved, more blood-giving) than non-religious Americans.

The resolution, if passed by the House as well, would clear the way for a ballot issue to change the judicial selection process as outlined in the Missouri Constitution.

Brewer is ideal in this repertory; she has a huge voice and it remains fresh and lustrous in all registers. Only in the opening song, and very briefly, did she show any tendency to blast.

The biblical narratives also record doubts on humanity's side -- doubts about the worth of obeying God and about His plans for us. By highlighting this aspect of humanity's relationship with God, the Bible reveals itself in an unexpected light: as a guidebook for confronting authority -- secular political authority as well as religious authority.
Terrance Mitchell, Oregon's freshman defensive back who earned a starting spot in the season opener following Cliff Harris' suspension, comes up big when it matters the most. On 2nd and 6 from the Wisconsin 44, Russell Wilson throws a 29-yard pass to Jared Abbrederis. Mitchell, however, manages to punch the ball out and it comes to rest almost exactly where it fell.

So am I saying that Mr. Obama did everything he could, and that everything would have been fine if he hadn't faced political opposition? By no means. Even given the political constraints, the administration did less than it could and should have in 2009, especially on housing.

"It's sort of like, 'Wow, this is horrible. Why is it funny?' " Linklater said. "But I've viewed the world that way my whole life — the weirdest, saddest, craziest things I kind of laugh at.

And for those on the anti-same-sex marriage bandwagon, you're not off the hook, either. I can honestly say that the vast majority of people I know who don't believe in same-sex marriage do not hate gay people and do not use foul, anti-gay language. I also know people who do. Their rush to judgment, inflammatory rhetoric and shrill, often vicious denunciations of those who voice opinions in favor of same-sex marriage are a powerful, destructive form of bullying intended to silence and stigmatize. Sound familiar?

It's clear that one thing the GOP has going for it -- perhaps the biggest thing -- is an awakened conservative base that's taking on Obama at every turn.

Eli Wallach portrays Amanda's L.A. neighbor, a long-retired Oscar-winning screenwriter.

Similarly, there's a scene where Miles strolls a video store aisle with Iris and goes on about what a great score Hans Zimmer wrote for "Driving Miss Daisy." Zimmer scored "The Holiday."

During lunch, Brooks awkwardly asks Vicki how the assets are going to be split in her divorce with Donn. Even though Tamra suspects our southern gentleman is an opportunist (and in the words of another Southerner: them's fightin’ words!), I am almost positive that Bravo producers put him up to that. Even Slade wouldn’t be that obvious. As a matter of fact, maybe Vicki told Brooks to ask that on camera. After all, she got to list about 4 different properties she is trying to sell, and we know that Tamra isn’t her realtor!
Ochocinco, the former Oregon State star who caught 12 passes for 159 yards and a touchdown in a 38-24 Patriots win last year, provides another option for Tom Brady, who has been without a deep target since the Patriots traded Randy Moss to the Minnesota Vikings after four games last season.

"To Be Sung Underwater" is a love story. Judith does go back. What does she hope to find? Is it too late? Too late for what? Love stories have a terrible gravity, a centrifugal force. McNeal has created characters so dimensional, so memorable, that we are caught up in that urgency. Our rationality is compromised; the rules of the world fade away. This is your last chance, Judith, do you hear me? — we shout at the flimsy pages. Get yourself back to Rufus Sage, Neb., and fast! There's not a moment to lose!

Mike Lupica, New York Daily News: "You think Bobby Petrino engaged in many searching moral inventories before he and that babe fell off the motorcycle?

I have a feeling that fans in most of the NBA cities that Miller has played in feel the same way. They don't fully realize what they had until he's gone.

Census figures show that nearly one-third of all people 65 and older live alone, and by their 80s more than half of women do.

Since emerging as a go-to target for Eli Manning in Week 3 when he caught three passes for 110 yards and three touchdowns against the Philadelphia Eagle’s vaunted secondary, Cruz has established himself as one of the league’s top big-play threats this season. With Steve Smith signing with the Eagles in the offseason and Mario Manningham battling through injuries all season, Cruz’s emergence after spending last season on the practice squad has been vital to the Giants offense.

Her fine-dining training - she worked for years at Fleur de Lys - is evident, and the casual attitude of the staff isn't at the expense of professionalism. Lindgren constantly circulates to suggest particular wines with specific dishes; in my experience she's never been wrong. Although it's a cliche, she truly treats everyone like a guest in her home.

Inaccurate diagnoses can result simply because blood draws were done at the wrong time of day. In men, testosterone levels peak in the morning and dip in the afternoon, so if doctors rely on a single blood test done in the afternoon, they may misdiagnose the source of the problem, Braunstein says.
During the robust economy of the '80s, Japan's exports ruled, and the country would import the best that money could buy from the rest of the globe, including Italian chefs and French sommeliers. Which made Japan an haute bourgeoisie heaven where luxury manufacturers from the West expected skyrocketing sales forever.
The cuisine: Sardinian. The compact menu features homey specialties such as fregula with pancetta and mushrooms, pasta with seasonal vegetables and bottarga, poached pork and cannellini bean salad, lamb stew, wine-braised tuna in an intense tomato sauce and Sonoma County-made salumi. For dessert, try strawberries and gelato drizzled with mirto (myrtle), or milk and barley pudding. The all-Italian wine list roams the island and the countryside.

"It's a funny game," manager Manny Acta said. "We had two games at home where we couldn't drive in the winning run from third base with less than two out. Then we get a check-swing RBI single with two out that kept the inning going and allowed us to score seven."
I asked Fernandez if his friendship with Mills was the reason he's finally found comfort. And they looked at each other like only good friends can, and denied that they even like each other. Mills said, "I really do wish he'd go." But their body language doesn't lie, and when I asked team president Larry Miller about Fernandez's change in attitude, he said, "I think Rudy was just homesick."
The inspiration: A mutation of two of the most popular styles in recent shoe memory -- the gladiator flat sandal meets the shoe boot of fall.
Age has caught up to the Steelers, who are loaded with 30-somethings and need to get younger. Their offensive line has been a problem area for several years, so watch for them to pick up some blockers in this draft.

Like political campaigns and horse races, you have to be in it to win it in the baseball playoffs. Good pitching can create a ruckus once a team sneaks in. The 1973 Mets won the NL East with an 82-79 record. They went to the seventh game of the World Series against the mustachioed dynasty that was building in Oakland. The Mets had great pitching.
Eric Steele's bet-you-didn't-see-that-coming "Cork's Cattlebaron," starring indie film staple Robert Longstreet, asked viewers to judge between two levels of boorishness, one compulsive, the other destructive.

The western limits are also jagged, extending a bit west of 66th Street in places, to Belcher Road in others and to 78th Street N in sections.
Part of the problem is structural; it's the Agriculture Department, not the EPA, that dispenses money for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program that addresses the vexing nutrient-loading problems. And that program money is due to be whacked this year in the Obama budget, in Missouri's case from $22 million to $15 million.

GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Prosecutors rested their case against John Edwards on Thursday after calling to the witness stand some of his closest friends and advisers, many of whom gave dramatic, often unflattering testimony about the former presidential candidate whose once-promising political career collapsed amid a sex scandal.

Among recent deals advertised on Foursquare: a free pitcher of margaritas at the Spanish Kitchen in Los Angeles, half-off happy-hour food and drinks at the Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood, and $5 off admission to the Contemporary Jewish Museum of San Francisco. Users who check in more often than anyone else at a business place and claim the virtual title of "mayor" often get stepped-up rewards.
The career trajectory of Hollywood directors before the '70s typically followed the winding path from unpretentious to "prestigious" (i.e., Oscar-worthy). Take, for example, George Stevens, who went from "Alice Adams," "Swing Time," "Gunga Din" and "The More the Merrier" to "A Place in the Sun," "Giant," "The Diary of Anne Frank" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Most of the '70s directors did their best to avoid this syndrome or at least held out for as long as they could. Coppola's "Apocalypse Now," a deranged movie about a deranged war, could never have been mistaken for a respectable war epic. Scorsese's biblical movie was "The Last Temptation of Christ."

Handicappers are eager to watch this vote for signs of contemporary bias. Carpenter has been a part of two World Series championship teams, and while he's set to open this season on the DL the afterglow of his October run is still shining -- and could tilt this vote.

In the wake of the Watts riots, Budd Schulberg helped to found the Watts Writers Workshop, mentoring African American writers such as Coleman, Quincy Troupe, Eric Priestley and the performance poetry group the Watts Prophets. In the wake of Watts, the city catalyzed around a variety of elements, not least the iconography of the fires, of L.A. turning inward to devour itself. "The city burning," Joan Didion wrote in her 1967 essay "Los Angeles Notebook," tracing the line of a more extensive history, "is Los Angeles's deepest image of itself: Nathanael West perceived that, in 'The Day of the Locust'; and at the time of the 1965 Watts riots what struck the imagination most indelibly were the fires. For days one could drive the Harbor Freeway and see the city on fire, just as we had always known it would be in the end."
“I certainly don’t encourage that,” the Giants’ coach said after practice Saturday. “I don’t think it has any place in what we’re doing in the preseason. We’re trying to prepare ourselves to play. It’s a very, very worthy opponent. It’ll be a good test. Let’s play and evaluate our people.”

Hart said it was all innocent, his consorting with a younger woman, but if innocent, not normal for an ordinary man truly wanting to preserve his troubled marriage, and most certainly not normal for a candidate for President for whom the old "character" issue was rapidly crystallizing into the issue of "womanizing." Hart, one of his campaign aides told Dionne, liked "to court danger." In 1987 he courted danger, and in the end embraced it.
Home prices in Portland have fallen more than 27 percent since peaking in 2007, and the rapid decline contributed to the high number of upside-down loans.
* Adalind, Hank and the Love Potion?: So Adalind gave Hank the love potion-laden chocolate chip cookies to lure Nick into Forest Park for a final battle? Because Renard told her to? Because her mother turns out to be an even more wicked witch than Adalind herself and Adalind doing this was paying some debt Catherine owed to Renard? All of the above for $500, Alex? Nick discovered Hank (Russell Hornsby) was dating Adalind when Nick and Juiiette met them for dinner at Brassierie Montmartre, which seems to be the official "Grimm" Portland restaurant. It didn't go so well, since Nick had earlier caught Adalind trying to kill Aunt Marie. But Nick got his revenge when, in a confrontation in Forest Park, he and Adalind shared a kiss-lip-bite exchange that robbed Adalind of her powers. Something about Nick's blood getting inside her...

The Haitians who moved said they were promised factory jobs and houses. But there were no real jobs in the area, and many of the tentlike shelters collapsed in the first hard rain. When Rolling Stone magazine mentioned the controversy in an article critical of Haitian relief efforts, Penn bristled in a letter to the editor that ran more than 7,000 words. "What those not in the field do not know is that 100 or more tents go down in EVERY camp with EVERY harsh rain," he wrote.

One reason volume is lower: Main Street investors have largely stayed out of the market, abandoning it to hedge funds, pension funds and other professional investors. Last year, individuals, as tracked by mutual fund flows, yanked $14 billion from stock mutual funds.
Take the 20 minute neighborhood concept. It's not just a planning exercise. It's an overlap of multiple bureaus: planning, transportation, development services, water, parks. We have to bring a creative mindset to a problem like that. Is that integrating the arts across the bureaus? It is for me.
"I was disappointed, to be sure, but I wasn't going to pout about it," he said. "I don't know anybody that likes to get cut back in any job they do.

It remains to be seen if Eminem and the other musical guests, living and deceased, are featured when Dre and Snoop headline next Sunday's closing weekend of Coachella. But there was something almost quaint about watching and hearing such a large audience engage in what might be termed gangsta rap nostalgia, given that Dre's landmark album, "The Chronic," was released in 1992. He underscored this point by asking the audience to cheer, depending on how long they had been fans -- in five year increments.
