Choices of maki rolls (hand rolls with raw or cooked fish), and sashimi (just the fish) are too numerous to name. You'll find the expected -- fresh salmon sushi (sake) at two pieces for $3.75.

The sushi here is good, not great, and not terribly expensive, but also not terribly cheap.

But the closest I ever came to a real hero wasn't Joe DiMaggio or Willie Mays. It was my eighth-grade teacher George Gordon, who regaled us with weekly lectures criticizing the methods of one of the era's great demagogues, the red-baiting Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. It was a much gutsier thing to do than it seems now, and I regret not thanking Mr. Gordon when I could have. If there's an afterlife, he'll be one of my first stops after I check in with my parents.

As a 40-year-old banker in his first run for Congress in 1972, Stark pounded the issue of age in his race against George P. Miller, an entrenched, 81-year-old opponent.

The test is a simple but effective one. It’s done with what Lynch calls a mold stick – it’s a plastic tube that encases a cotton swab. At the top is a plastic vial in a bulb shape. The user bends the bulb to crack the seal, then a chemical wets the cotton swab, turning it green. The user rubs the swab on the suspected mold. If the swab stays green, it’s not mold. If it turns gray, it’s dormant mold. If it turns purple, it’s active mold.

Internist Wendy Zaharko, a Princeton native and Aspen resident, says she’s come to understand the medicinal power of cannabis by listening to her patients. She’s impressed by how it reduces muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis patients and cures insomnia in people with chronic pain. Pot also aids people with chronic depression and anxiety, even if some of those conditions don’t yet fit the precise definition of a qualified illness, she said. Many patients don’t have insurance, so she is the only physician they see, she said.

California is loaded with cows, each happily leaving behind potentially gas-producing waste. But in testimony before the Energy Commission, representatives from Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Gas turned up their collective noses at California biogas in its many forms.
Rice and Hansen create a wonderfully electric chemistry that lends sparkle to this unlikely tale, and director Ellen Fenster carefully modulates the tone as the focus moves back and forth between the two. Hansen's Colm is a complex combination of passion and innocence, consumed with awkward embarrassment when he has to admit to Timothea that he's a "35-year-old spinster man," yet masterfully eloquent when describing the emotional impact of the death of a friend. Rice offers a nice counterpoint with a character whose sprightly charm overlays a steely resolve to live her life on her own terms. The production offers a thoroughly delightful staging of this rarely produced play.

I remember arguing with my mom about wearing lipstick and eyeliner in high school. I'm sure my daughter and I will have more spirited conversations about it as she gets older, too. I bought my daughter a Burt Bee's conditioning lip balm, but that's the extent of her beauty products. For now, her best look is when she's been playing outside and her cheeks are flushed from climbing a tree or riding her bike.
didn't like slightly sweet, funky Belgian-style ales dosed with lots of hops. But the last two I've tried - Stone Cali-Belgique IPA and Perennial Artisan Ales Hommel Bier - proved that I just hadn't found the right ones. If Hommel Bier is any indication of what to expect from Perennial once it's up and running this summer, St. Louis beer lovers have reason to be very excited.

That victory was perhaps a more significant moment in the cultural history of Los Angeles than in Legorreta's own career. His scheme, a collaboration with the landscape architect Laurie Olin anchored by a 10-story purple bell tower, has been harshly criticized over the years, largely because it exacerbates the plaza's detachment from the city around it.

Sure he does. Obama always treats Hispanics like he's doing us a favor. What other bloc of voters gets talked to this way? In politics, what matters is results; not good intentions.

This is the heart of Florida's oyster industry, and before long I came upon a building with round holes in the wall. Every few seconds, oyster shells shot out of the holes. Behind each hole sat a shucker. They worked, joked with each other in grits-and-gravy accents, and listened to country music twanging from radio station WOYS 100.5 FM in Apalachicola. When the piles of empty shells get high enough, they're hauled away, recycled, and used to plant new oyster beds.

What has Greg Little proven this year and has he proven he will be on an NFL field for years to come? “I’d like to think he will be. He’s done some good things this year. He’s had to deal with what pros have to deal with, learning how this game works, having a good game, dealing with a couple bad games and then coming back. As he goes through the process, I think next time he goes through the length of the season he’ll even be better. I anticipate he’ll be a fine player in this league for a long time.”

The original 1978 horror-comedy "Piranha" was an overt "Jaws" ripoff/parody, and the 2010 remake retains that tongue-in-cheek spirit, telling a self-consciously silly story about an earthquake that sends schools of flesh-eating fish racing toward a beach full of spring-breakers. Director Alexandre Aja piles up the R-rated gross-out gags, many of which make clever use of 3-D effects, for those who have the technology to appreciate them. But even 2-D TV owners can enjoy this movie's deadpan humor, well-performed by a cast full of young and old comedy stars (including Adam Scott, Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd and a suspiciously "Jaws"-y Richard Dreyfuss). The DVD and Blu-ray include deleted scenes, featurettes and an Aja commentary.

"I don't think he set out for me," Storr said "If I was standing in my net, I probably wouldn't have got touched. I just think it arose at the right time and it happened. That's why there's no anger towards it. If they were up 3-0 and I was Geoff Courtnall, I wouldn't regret anything. I don't think he should. It was part of the game. It's just a play that happened."

In the end, free societies get the governments they deserve. So, if the American people wish to choose their chief executive on the basis of the "war on women," the Republican theocrats' confiscation of your contraceptives, or whatever other mangy and emaciated rabbit the Great Magician produces from his threadbare topper, they are free to do so, and they will live with the consequences. This week's bit of ham-handed misdirection was "the Buffett Rule," a not-so-disguised capital-gains tax hike designed to ensure that Warren Buffett pays as much tax as his secretary. If the alleged Sage of Omaha is as exercised about this as his public effusions would suggest, I'd be in favor of repealing the prohibition on Bills of Attainder, and the old boy could sleep easy at night. But instead every other American "millionaire" will be subject to the new rule – because, as President Obama said this week, it "will help us close our deficit."

What you're going to see -- particularly with smaller banks, with the changes in some of the regulations -- it's going to put pressure from a compliance point of view on some of the banks.

Presidents don't have a great deal of control over oil or gas prices, which now are being influenced by higher U.S. demand and tensions over Iran's nuclear program. But few factors generate as much interest and anxiety among Americans. The rise in prices, faced almost daily by voters, could undercut Obama's argument that he's strengthening the economy and making families more financially secure.
Charles Tillman made the Pro Bowl last season, and Tim Jennings is a good tackler who fits Smith's defense. But the Bears could use an infusion of youth and expertise here - someone to push or beat out Jennings and eventually replace Tillman.

Ed was more of an opportunist than Cy was. After the jack of diamonds wins, Cy loses nothing by leading a heart to his queen next. When that finesse wins, he has nine tricks -- three clubs, three diamonds, two hearts and a spade -- and can afford to lead a diamond to the king next. His reward will be three overtricks, not two undertricks.

Arrogance, not good intentions, finally undid Tressel. He thought he could get away with the cover-up because he had gotten away, untainted, in the other scandals that involved his elite players, both at Ohio State and Youngstown State before that.

Just how big special teams would feature became clear from the start. The Wings went on the power play 2 minutes into the game, and at least were able to keep the puck in Nashville's zone.

Even though those aren't necessarily fighting words, showing even mild disapproval of the operative's comment was wise. Attacking stay-at-home parents isn't especially smart. We're home nearly all day, after all! A lot of us have the ability to make sure our votes are in the mail. And polling places aren't bars -- they accept minors. A walkable field trip for the kids is actually a brilliant way to spend our gobs of "free" time.

Answer - Mycobacterium (MIKE-oh-back-TIER-ee-um) avium-intracellulare also goes by the name MAC, mycobacterium avium complex. It's a relative of the TB germ. It doesn't cause TB. It isn't passed to others through airborne coughs and sneezes as TB is. It's a bacterium found all over the place - in soil, in fresh water, in saltwater and in brackish water. Human exposure to it is universal. Illness as a result of exposure is rare. For most, it causes no symptoms. For some, it brings on a cough. And for others it's discovered accidentally on a routine chest X-ray or lung scan.

As long as the couple continues to live in a state that recognizes their same-sex marriage, many state-based rights extend to them, often including rights surrounding hospital visitation and emergency medical treatment, inheritance, workers' compensation benefits if a spouse dies at work, health insurance and pension benefits for spouses of public employees, and divorce—including alimony.

Michael Weiner, the stubbornly logical executive director of the Players Association, said last week that the steroid guys should be in the Hall, despite taking advantage of the rules. I don’t disagree but I can’t vote for them as long as the ballot I’m given by the Hall says that I am to consider the character, sportsmanship and integrity of players. Steroids were an assault on the integrity of the game, and players knew they were playing fast and loose when they used them. As a voter, I can’t get around those conclusions. Rodriguez will be a difficult case for me to decide because he was never identified as having tested positive, but the changes in his body – both up and down – make a lot of people wonder if something was up. Hopefully the Hall’s board of directors will have provided some directions to voters on how to handle the outdated voting rules. But there has no been no indication of that, as the majority of my peers don’t feel they need clarification.

Further investigation into the incident also led to a charge being filed against the former NFL star, police said late Tuesday, although it did not warrant his arrest.

Lurking in the background of these swift-moving opening chapters are those matching tattoos (of manga kittens, if you want to know), waiting to trigger mayhem like guns shown on the wall in the first act of a Chekhov play. Greenland, who in recent years has scripted and produced episodes of the HBO series "Big Love," isn't just a knowing, irreverent satirist. His story structure has the kind of effortlessness that comes with only bucket loads of hard work. Clues are planted, leads followed, and scarily pungent oddball characters introduced, including gun-for-hire Odin Brick, "sporting designer knock-off shades, smoking a Camel and doing his best Johnny Depp."
Now, Joseph Ferguson, the city of Chicago's inspector general, is urging Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration to permanently ban Windy City, its owners and their husbands from doing any more work for the city. Ferguson says that, eight years ago, the sisters-in-law falsely claimed they were the operators of Windy City so they could be certified by the city as a woman-owned business enterprise. That made them eligible for city work set aside for women-owned businesses.

I'd say if it's your first cruise, you don't have to splurge on a room. What I have found is that you are in the cabin very little so you are always doing something. My kids enjoy the inside cabins because it's dark and they can take a nap in the afternoon. If the main thing is cost, and you are trying to get as much value as you can for your dollar, don't splurge on a really nice cabin. Get a medium or lower one to see if you like the cruising experience.
