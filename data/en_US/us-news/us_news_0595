Investors have long viewed the private student-housing operators as a defensive stock play: They've done well because the economic downturn has increased interest in obtaining a college degree, particularly at more affordable state schools.

When all of the bread was gone, I told the fellow to get up on his wagon and get out of the park as soon as he could, otherwise I would make things pretty hard for him. He was awful mad, as you can imagine, but he took my bluff and got out. This was the first time I had ever turned a highway man and I really had no authority to do what I did, but the people were in want and the man was trying to rob them, so I had to think quickly before he got away, and being that martial law controlled the city, I took the chance of bluffing the baker and won out. The people got all he had for nothing, just because he tried to rob them first. In my own heart, I think I did right.

The biodegradable bags that San Francisco hoped to promote looked like plastic but were made of corn. It turns out they aren't strong enough, so it takes triple bagging to do the job of one plastic bag. They are also three times as expensive, burdening consumers with the cost equivalent of using as many as nine plastic bags. And the worst part: If these bags are mixed in with plastic bags for recycling, it ruins the plastic and the whole batch has to be dumped into the landfill. Bad news for everyone and the planet.

You really can't go to Jeff City without stopping at Missouri's Capitol building. One-hour tours (which take place at various times) are free and quite educational. You'll get a detailed explanation of the architecture, the sculptures and the Benton mural on the wall of the House Lounge. You'll also get to sit in the balcony overlooking the majestic House of Representatives. One of my favorite spots was the Hall of Famous Missourians, where bronze busts of the state's noteworthy figures made me proud to be from here. My kids, 5 and 7, found the paintings (and their changing perspectives) interesting; but I'll confess they did get bored on the tour. The Capitol building's main floor houses the Missouri State Museum, which features a large Civil War exhibit to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the war. Various displays describe Missouri's unique position in the conflict. The kids enjoyed the interactive area set up with a tent, clothing you can try on and games. (Free,

Critics of U.S. foreign policy have long caterwauled about American "empire."

Outlook: The Theo Epstein era begins with the Cubs rebuilding. Again. Seems as if that has been happening since 1908. Volstad, while not a star, will be more dependable than Zambrano. Without power hitters Ramirez and Pena, the Cubs might be more of a slap-and-dash team in 2012.

"He did it on this own, and he shouldn't have," Wedge said. "I've talked to him already. I asked him his reasons for it, and he had good answers, but it's still not what we wanted to do right there. If we're go to do that right there, it's going to come from me. Everybody is going to be aware of it, so there's a level of awareness that allows Kawasaki to get home, quite frankly."

Berkman described how Pujols and Molina had "a great chemistry" when it came to pulling off the pickoff. He should know. On April 7, 2008, Berkman was the Houston Astro caught by Molina and Pujols to end the eighth inning. That was the 22nd pickoff of Molina's career. Twenty-one of his first 24 pickoffs ended an inning. While still preferring to try a pickoff when a lefthanded batter is there to screen his attempt, Molina has varied things as his reputation grew. Only six of his past 17 pickoffs have been for the final out of an inning.
The loan will be paid back with 75 percent of the city's urban renewal money, our tax money, for the next 15 years without a vote. This fact has not changed since last March. However, the city's funding formula has changed. Part of the payment will now come from the city's general fund – 100 percent Gladstone taxpayer money. Part will come from the mysterious surplus from the county library fund. Even if a surplus was possible, part of the county fund is also Gladstone taxpayer money.
Right now service personnel and veterans get their health insurance through the military’s plan, called Tricare. Its generous benefits and low premiums are part of the price we pay for attracting and keeping the best and brightest in an all-volunteer military — along with other benefits, like covering 100 percent of college tuition and full pension on retirement, regardless of age.
So far, investigators for Mr. Lawsky have found that 15% to 35% of premiums collected by force-placed insurers flows to brokers in the form of commissions, according to people familiar with the situation. Insurers also paid fees to banks to get reinsurance that shields the insurer from responsibility for paying claims, these people said.
Francis was an absolute force of nature in the postseason. The super-athletic, 5-foot-9 outside hitter had a ridiculous 27 kills in the NYSAISAA semifinals against Chapin to lead the Eagles to their first state final since 2003.

The show Tressel and school president Gordon Gee put on was transparently preposterous, and they knew it would be. The Yahoo cops had them, and they knew somebody could get them eventually. But they didn't care because they didn't have to. They're making payroll, and they made it big last year. They'll make it big next year. They'll make it big every year, because in Ohio, TOSU means more than nearly anything else. The Horseshoe will be filled because it is a sacred rite in that state, and the money will pour in because it never doesn't. All that happened Tuesday was that the school lost a bit of its smug. They'll get that back in no time, the same way that every other school caught, and every school about to be caught, does.
"I don't consider Garcia a .500 pitcher. But the way he pitched the last 2½ months of last year was like a 24-year-old trying to pitch like a 34-year-old instead of trusting his natural ability. Every time he lets the ball loose, it moves. Why worry about hitting the corners?"
Hanger steak, cooked on the rare side of medium-rare, has been a regular on the menu lately, and it's worth a drive across town. Blood-red at the center, it's served sliced in a gossamer red-wine sauce with the tiniest fingerlings and Brussels sprouts aux lardons. Sometimes he'll have an aged New York steak with a deep, beefy flavor. Or pork, with a swatch of beautifully cooked pork belly and the roasted loin.

Get down: If you'd prefer to stay dry and cool, a walk through a lava tube is a tangible lesson in the power of swiftly flowing lava. Found throughout the islands, the most famous example is in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. Nahuku, more widely known as the Thurston Lava Tube, was created some 500 years ago by an underground torrent and discovered by Lorrin Thurston in 1913. Up to 13 feet high — watch out for lower parts — and 600 feet long, the cavelike structure now has a paved and illuminated segment at the beginning, followed by a 50-yard, rocky stretch through darkness. The latter provides good spooky fun if you have a good flashlight and tread carefully. Another lava tube in the park, Pua Po'o, is open to the public via guided ranger tours on Wednesdays; contact the visitors center for reservations (808-985-6000.) Due to the sensitive ecology and potential hazards, all other caves and tubes in the park are closed to visitors. ﻿

Outlook: This is a rematch of last year’s Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association A Conference championship — a 13-8 Gilman win — and could easily end up being a preview of this year’s title game. Both teams enjoyed plenty of success in their early non-conference schedules and were impressive in league-opening wins Tuesday. The top-ranked Cardinals flexed their muscles at No. 4 Boys’ Latin, coming away with a stunningly comfortable 12-5 win. The Greyhounds got a three-goal performance from Koerber and sound team defense to handle visiting and No. 7 McDonogh, 8-5. Almost all of the early-season talk has deep and talented Calvert Hall decidely at the top with the rest of the talented MIAA pack a step behind. The Cardinals will try to further solidify that point against the Greyhounds. Stephen Kelly is the starting point for the Cardinals with his ability to win faceoffs, collect ground balls and score, and he has plenty of talent surrounding him. Patrick Kelly and Ryan Brown lead a deep attack, and Connell is the mainstay in back. The Greyhounds will have to find a way to consistently get the ball and make the most of their possessions. Koerber and Matthai are their top two playmakers on offense, and it will take a collective effort on defense to contain the Cardinals.

Mr. Tykwer is a director of distinction -- his films include "Run Lola Run," "The Princess and the Warrior" and "Heaven" (which was distinguished by Cate Blanchett's formidable performance.) His work in "Perfume" is audacious, often elegant, and the film's strong cast includes Alan Rickman, Rachel Hurd-Wood, Dustin Hoffman doing an amusing turn as a Parisian perfumer, and Ben Wishaw as Grenouille, whose spectacular rise and epic fall suggest the trajectory of an anti-Christ. Once you've seen "Perfume" you're unlikely to forget it. But once the movie broke its spell and the story turned silly -- "Perfume" is very long -- I found myself thinking not of elixirs or even pheromones, but of Jimmy Durante, who would point to his fabled schnozzola and say gleefully, "The nose knows."

Same goes for Fernandez, who whined about his playing time over the last year.

In the last segment, he asked what was "the most painful check you've ever had to write for the IRS." Again, she was surprised, and refused to name a dollar amount - but here again, we could see there was one she dearly regretted.

State health regulations enacted in 2006 require that standing water be treated with chlorine and recirculated regularly to prevent outbreaks of bacterial infections like one that sickened 60 people in Hubbard in 2003.

When G's wife left a few years ago, he became the single parent of a severely autistic teenage son and two younger children. The oldest doesn't speak, is hyperactive and very unpredictable. The younger siblings try to help with him, but most of the care falls on Dad. G works part time and handiwork jobs when he can find them. His main focus is keeping his children safe and happy. One thing that helps with the oldest son is having cable TV. The 17-year-old gets obsessed with shows, and when the cable is out, he can become out of control. G could use help paying the cable bill, and the family would appreciate a better TV.

The private sector offers an alternative: long-term care insurance. A 50-year-old male, for example, might pay $1,500 to $1,800 a year for an individual policy that would pay $150 a day in benefits when needed, for up to three years, and the benefits would automatically adjust with inflation, said Marty Puin, head of Marty Puin and Associates, a Lyndhurst-based insurance agency specializing in long-term-care policies. Or a group policy for that same man, but sold through an employer, might cost $528 a year -- though with no inflation provision -- and pay $200 a day for two years.

Long before the invasion of today's pizza chains, my grandparents opened one of the first pizza shops in Cleveland in the 1940s. Joe Peep's pizzeria was located on Lorain Avenue, near West 65 Street and across the street from the post office. Along with Dagwood sandwiches, spaghetti and meatballs, and other Italian specialties, they made some of the best pizzas around. I remember visiting my grandparents often as a kid in the '60s and '70s, and each time they would bake me my own personal favorite: a pepperoni-and-mushroom pie. As if it were yesterday, I can still taste that fresh and delicious New York-style pizza with its gooey cheese and toppings, aromatic sauce and perfect crust. With a slice of pizza in one hand, a little bottle of O-So grape soda pop in the other and the jukebox playing Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walkin,' " I was one happy kid -- oh how I long for another Joe Peeps pie! -- John Palazzo, Avon

At first, Price said she was reluctant to put Gary on medication. But since she has, he's been a new boy. The class disruptions have stopped. He's been able to sit still. And now he's one of the better students in his class.

The Earthquakes moved atop the Western Conference on Saturday night after getting stunning goals from Simon Dawkins and Chris Wondolowski in second-half stoppage time to surprise Real Salt Lake 3-1.
In the final 13 minutes, before that final 3-pointer, Sullinger missed a turnaround in the lane, had a 5-footer go in and out after he caught a lob and shot it before he landed, and backed in and muscled through a late double team and missed a leaner. He also drew a foul and made two free throws to cut the Wisconsin edge to 65-63 with 58 seconds left. So he was around, and his teammates had chances, too -- while the Buckeyes were 0-for-4 during the Badgers' 15-0 run, several were good looks that rimmed out.
"I’ve lived in the town since 1985, and I’ve seen such a dramatic increase in diversification," Mansbach said.

A scan of the crowd, which ranged from junior high students to college graduates, revealed at least one chaperone. Although the Beaumont Club was a third full at best, the attraction is obvious: Civil Twilight write catchy songs that perfectly capture a mood. Their familiarity is their biggest selling point. Although the material may have been drawn from the previous generation, it can easily be assimilated and claimed by young listeners as their own.
Neither is making wishes come true, but it sure is fun trying.
Gilbey broke a scoreless tie in the 19th minute when he banked his own rebound past NYSAIS goalkeeper Angus MacIntyre (Packer). Gilbey’s initial shot hit the post but he was able to stay with the play and score.

That's more bucolic than the Rio Bourriquot -- Grace wine director and mixologist Eduardo Porto Carreiro's ginger-infused Caipirinha for fall. To the Brazilian spirit cachaça he adds lime juice and sugar, along with muddled, sliced ginger for kick and tops it off with club soda. How did it get its name? Porto Carreiro says it was inspired by two of his favorite cocktails, the Moscow Mule and the Caipirinha. So you have Rio (as in de Janeiro) instead of Moscow; bourriquot is French slang for donkey. (Get it?)
You see, Manning doesn't lead the way most quarterbacks do: With fiery speeches, impassioned pleas or head butts for his linemen a la Tom Brady. Manning leads with practical jokes played mostly upon his offensive linemen that let them know there's more to him than the straight face, slumped shoulders and goofy grin.
"The Cabin in the Woods": Remember a crazy little 1980s movie with a woodsy cabin setting called "The Evil Dead" from some metro Detroit guys led by Sam Raimi? This horror film could have a similar impact on the genre. The tale of handsome young people who travel to a house in a forest -- what, Cancun was booked again? -- is generating positive word of mouth and Web. It stars a pre-"Thor" Chris Hemsworth, is directed by Drew Goddard (who wrote "Cloverfield") and was cowritten by Goddard and Joss Whedon (director of "The Avengers"). After being shot in 2009, then stalled by MGM's financial troubles, and then finding a new home with Lionsgate, it's finally set to hit theaters April 13. Be afraid, be very, very afraid -- and don't get within a mile of any potential spoilers, because the fun is supposed to be in the inventive plot twists.

storm got my eyes opened once more, and Tiny Bits started whining again. I waited, seeing if he would calm himself down, but this one sounded real. I slipped my glasses on and started to get up. Suddenly the sounds from the Bits' room ceased. The storm had also settled down and everything seemed right with the world again.

A: The most common first thought is: "I have a business plan that I've executed here in the U.S. Can't I just take this same plan and translate it?" The answer is no. We really stress the importance of developing a business plan for your international markets as well.

It's not as if the creature was a snake. Now that would ratchet up my creepy factor another level. I once really did see a snake in our garden and didn't go back to that area for six weeks. Another time (my excuse is it was dark), I was out with a flashlight and scissors on a slug-finding mission. I saw a snake, clear as could be, in the middle of a path.

Any other company with such shoddy safety and record-keeping practices would be out of business by now, but not the unspeakable PG&E monopoly. Day after day, we read news stories about PG&E's failings, and we wonder when the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) will get serious about reforming the giant utility to protect the public from unsafe pipelines, crooked and cooked books, and general contempt for ratepayers, all culminating in a natural gas explosion that killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes in San Bruno last year. Paying fines and legal settlements is just a drop in the bucket for PG&E, and obviously has not changed the arrogant corporate culture at the utility. The situation requires drastic intervention. PUC regulators need to be watchdogs, not lapdogs.

Iconic structures such as the I. Magnin building dot the area, but it was the restoration of two grand dames that jump-started the neighborhood's resurgence as a night-life and arts magnet. The Fox Theater (www.thefoxoakland.com), a 1928 Moorish gem on Telegraph Avenue, and the Paramount Theatre (www.paramounttheatre.com), a Depression-era Art Deco beauty on Broadway, give heft to the Uptown culture boom. The Fox reopened in 2009 as an indie music venue after a multimillion-dollar renovation; the Paramount is home to the Oakland East Bay Symphony.

Measured by the quality of its cuisine and the originality of its gastronomic challenges, the seventh season of the cooking show was certainly its most distinguished. Viewers may have been transfixed by brothers Michael and Bryan Voltaggio squaring off in the Napa Valley finals, but that familial duel often was a mere amuse bouche to the entrée of consistently excellent preparation, all of it scored by "some of the top chefs in the world as guest judges," said Jane Lipsitz of production company Magical Elves.

The AAUW report offers hope and some surprising insights about the harassers, many of whom thought their actions were “no big deal” or “funny.” Imagine if these kids were educated so as to understand that sexual harassment is neither.
"Do you want one in your neighborhood!" he barked.
But that's another matter. Here's a handy formula for anyone wishing to understand the disingenuousness of conservatives in regard to funding Social Security for future retirees and the disabled:
Davone Bess, WR, Dolphins. Bess is easy to overlook in an offense that features Brandon Marshall and Reggie Bush. But he is arguably Henne's steadiest receiver, and he should be very busy as the Dolphins try to keep pace with the Texans' prolific offense. In PPR leagues, Bess is an even better option.
"This gives the players an opportunity to put themselves in front of us. And these are players that we may not otherwise get a chance to see, considering the amount of travel it would take to see all these players," Timbers coach Gavin Wilkinson said. "It brings them all to a centralized location, and we get the chance to look at them and see if there is a player that we would bring on board."

There was also a breezy informality then. At the luge (French for "sled") competition, you could walk right up to the rail atop the icy chute during practice runs. It would be unfathomable in the world since 9-11. Before you even saw the sleds, you could hear the rail begin to hum and sing from the vibration of the sled's runners chewing away at the ice. Then, the rail started quivering, as if in the throes of an icequake. It shook and shuddered harder as the lugers, flashing past in a streak of color, rumbled downhill.
And there was certainly no shortage of doomsday talk during the Clinton years.

"It's hard to put your finger on it and describe exactly what you see," Davidson said. "But you can tell when a guy has a true passion for what he does. In my opinion, if we can get ourselves a room full of guys with a passion for the game, we've done our job. The vision here is to get smart, tough guys who have a passion for the game. Matt fits that bill."
Davis' "Help" castmate Octavia Spencer took home the best supporting actress statuette for her role as Minnie Jackson.

While I will agree there are people like that out there, I must say that just making a blanket statement like the one above does a disservice to unemployed folks like myself who work hard every day to try and find work and just come back unsuccessful. I am a registered medical assistant who has been out of work for well over a year now and have been looking for a new job since the day I lost my previous position. I have not been localizing my search only to medical work. As a matter of fact my job search has been very broad, including all jobs I am capable of doing, including retail work.
The fire is under investigation by the state fire marshal, and Bridgewater fire and police departments. It does not appear suspicious, Rogers said.
But would accepting some standard of justice -- for example, that He keep His promises to humanity -- limit God? In the biblical narratives, this possibility is raised but never resolved. When God appears to Job in the whirlwind, He seems to mock Job for daring to see any limitation on His power. But later, God seems to acknowledge the truth of Job's claim by restoring his previous fortune twice over. God thus paid double indemnity, in effect, pleading guilty in Job's lawsuit against Him for wrongful conduct.

"AT&T and Dish supposedly had a tentative deal several years ago, and Charlie turned it down," said Donna Jaegers, an analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co. in Denver. "Now with pay-TV not quite as attractive as it was when he turned down the deal, I think he's looking to maybe attract somebody with the spectrum."

Felton is the unquestioned starter at point guard and Wesley Matthews will reclaim his job as the Blazers' starting shooting guard, which he inherited last season when Roy first encountered knee trouble. Nicolas Batum, who has spent his three-year career exclusively playing small forward, likely will see time at shooting guard behind Matthews.

"Occasionally, the house will shift," he says, as if it's a minor detail. The town, he explains, is perched above geographical fault lines and more than 80 miles of underground tunnels from the old copper mines.
